We argue that the label [["science diplomacy" limits]{.mark} the kinds
of [knowledge systems]{.mark} that are included in its
scope]{.underline}. In the reality of science diplomacy in the Arctic, a
host of other knowledges and research practices are at work, from
Indigenous or Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to local knowledge
and citizen science. While there is growing collaboration in research
between science and TEK in funded research projects, and even some major
international agreements (such as the Paris Agreement) that make space
for Indigenous knowledge, [[there is insufficient]{.mark} recognition
and [inclusion]{.mark} of recommendations in agreements that emerge
[from science diplomacy]{.mark} efforts]{.underline}. Not only does the
[[exclusion of other forms of knowledge]{.mark} beyond traditional forms
of science [limit the effectiveness of science diplomacy
outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}, but it also raises questions of
structural injustice4 and challenges for the exercise of Indigenous
sovereignty. [Excluding Indigenous knowledge holders from 'science'
diplomacy]{.underline} [through]{.underline} labelling conventions or
from [the co-creation of policy outcomes]{.underline} through systemic
marginalization inherently undermines Indigenous rights and
self-determination.5 Within the current framework, TEK contributions are
not considered alongside STEM or SSH6 research as the primary knowledge
basis that science diplomacy is informed by and facilitates, limiting
TEK's recognition and influence. Yet, the value of TEK has been proven
many times over, evident in contributions of Indigenous knowledge in the
Arctic context. For instance, in the Gwich'in Council International's
work on wildfires via the Arctic Circle Working Groups on the
Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) and Emergency Prevention,
Preparedness, and Response (EPPR).7 We argue that the framework of
science diplomacy should include other forms of knowledge and agency.
Science Diplomacy is Not Just for the Good Guys Discussions of science
diplomacy in politics, the media, and academic literature often frame
science diplomacy as premised on good intentions. In this approach,
collaboration is understood as the development of mutual understanding
between nations and science-informed strategic thinking, especially in
building solutions for global challenges. But, [like all
frameworks]{.underline} or tools intended for finding common interest in
political relationships, [[science diplomacy can also be used to amplify
business or state interests, advancing geopolitical interests divorced
from the common good]{.underline}]{.mark}. We see this as malignant
science diplomacy, [with]{.underline} varying [significance in the
Arctic]{.underline} with its permanent populations and sovereign
governance versus the Antarctic and its suspended claims to sovereignty
and management through the multi-lateral Antarctic Treaty System.
Turning to the Antarctic, the example of emperor penguin protection
highlights how geopolitical interests can block science-informed policy.
Proposals to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) to better safeguard
the penguins from the effects of the climate crisis, pollution, and
tourism have enjoyed widespread support from nations active in Antarctic
governance. However, [[Russian and Chinese governments
have]{.underline}]{.mark} repeatedly opposed them using what experts are
calling [["'spurious science' and other bad-faith
arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}."8 The Chinese government, in particular,
has been criticized for citing the work of a divisive researcher who
questions the impacts of climate change on polar species.9 Other nations
have announced plans to implement the MPA proposal "on a national basis"
despite China and Russia's objections.10 While this push to implement
MPAs neatly fits the conventional understanding of science diplomacy,
its premise on positive intent (e.g., pro-conservation science
diplomacy) poses challenges to the analysis and interpretation of Russia
and China's opposition. Similarly, elsewhere in the Arctic, [[economic
interests are driving the development and exploitation of culturally and
environmentally sensitive landscapes]{.underline}]{.mark}, as seen in
renewable energy development and geoengineering.11 These examples
illustrate the vulnerability of conventional understandings of science
diplomacy, which build on inherently optimistic interpretations of the
framework.12

Russia's war in Ukraine has drastically affected the Arctic governance,
freezing institutional mechanisms established in the post-Cold War
period. Among the lasting consequences, [[scientific cooperation]{.mark}
between Western and Russian research communities [has been
impaired]{.mark}]{.underline} involving international projects on
critical environmental issues in the polar region. Although joint
research activities have been curtailed since February 2022, efforts
have been made to revive Arctic scientific dialogue to address the
pressing concerns related to rapid climate change in the polar region.
Monitoring permafrost conditions is a key feature in anticipating the
future trajectory of the planet. However, about 65% of Russia's
territory is covered by permafrost, which represents a serious blind
spot for the Western scientific community without data access. Given the
current geopolitical breakdown, this situation could jeopardize climate
modeling and ultimately pose a threat to international security. At the
same time, [[Russia is pursuing and developing Arctic scientific
cooperation with non-Western partners, including China and
India]{.underline}]{.mark}. These countries are now becoming competitors
with the Western research community, thereby [[creating alternative
channels for]{.mark} the flow of [scientific
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. Using the example of permafrost
research, this article examines the long-term implications of the
decoupling of Russia and the West in the domain of polar science.

### 1NC -- Sanctions Kill the Plan

#### The tying of science diplomacy to sanctions has created a fundamental shift in the role of science. Sanctions undermine the ability of the aff to achieve any meaningful cooperation

Scientific Sanctions against Russia" **July** 01, **2025**

-Date Accessed -- 07/01/25//KSH

It appears that [scientific sanctions were]{.underline} perhaps
[enacted]{.underline} simply [as a]{.underline} symbolic (Flink, Müller,
and Dall, 2022) [expression of moral indignation with Russia's use of
military force against Ukraine]{.underline}, in the face of which doing
"business as usual" was deemed impossible (Science Business, 2022;
Ruffini, 2023). Since science diplomacy is seen in Europe as a natural
extension of European values (Moedas, 2016), it should come as no
surprise that the war in Ukraine was described by EU officials as "an
attack on elementary values of freedom, democracy and
self-determination, on which cultural expression, academic and
scientific freedom and scientific cooperation are based" (Gabriel,
2022). In this context [the use of [scientific sanctions has made
science diplomacy subordinated to]{.mark} the current [ideological
confrontation]{.mark} between 'liberal democracies' and 'authoritarian
regimes' [like Russia]{.mark} (but also [China)]{.mark}]{.underline}
that are perceived by the EU as systemic rivals. Notably, countries that
have imposed scientific sanctions on Russia are generally those that
have enforced economic sanctions, which is yet another proof of a
political reading. [The freezing of scientific cooperation by Western
academic and scientific institutions with Russia is remarkably aligned
with the West's hostile foreign policy towards Russia]{.underline}.
Thus, EU political priorities have taken precedence of the scientific
agenda. This raises the question of scientific sanctions' impact on
science diplomacy. Since its inception, the dominant narrative of
science diplomacy has been about "using scientific cooperation to
improve international relations" (Royal Society and AAAS 2010, p. vi.).
[[Disruption of international scientific exchange]{.mark} and
cooperation [is being used]{.mark} by the EU [as a diplomatic coercive
tool]{.mark}]{.underline} in "instances when science diplomacy needs to
be used as a hard power, i.e., for shutting doors rather than keeping
them open by applying restrictive measures, as happened in the wake of
the Russian aggression against Ukraine" (European Commission, 2025, p.
43). [[This transforms the essence of science
diplomacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Traditionally associated with soft
power, today, amidst scientific sanctions driven by the logic of
constraint, not persuasion, science diplomacy is becoming "a formidable
political and strategic tool that serves as an element of coercive hard
power. In the case of the current war in Ukraine, [science diplomacy,
exercised through scientific sanctions, has proved [to be a punitive
strategy]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Rentetzi, 2022). Indeed, [science for
diplomacy is being replaced by science to condemn]{.underline} and
punish. It is too early to speculate on the reversibility of scientific
sanctions and a return to constructive and peaceful science diplomacy[.
[There are no signs that broken international scientific cooperation
will be restored]{.mark} any time soon]{.underline}. But science knows
no borders, and scientists and academia have always been uniquely placed
to contribute to dialogue and peaceful relations between nations.

[[Arctic order]{.underline}]{.mark} historically, currently, and in the
future [[reflects]{.mark} the [world order]{.mark}. The idea of '[Arctic
exceptionalism' is not valid and is a poor guide for
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. During Cold War bipolarity, the Arctic was
divided between the Soviet Arctic and the Nordic and North American
Arctic. [US victory]{.underline} and Soviet defeat [in the Cold War led
to US unipolarity and hegemony which was the basis for a circumpolar
(including Russia) liberal (as opposed to realist) Arctic
order]{.underline} with organizations, such as the Arctic Council,
International Arctic Science Committee, University of the Arctic,
Barents and Bering regional cooperation, all on liberal topics such as
science, environment, Indigenous rights, people-to-people cooperation.1
[US unipolarity and hegemony are slipping away to world order
characteristics of continued US unipolarity and hegemony, Sino-American
bipolarity in economics and S&T and multipolarity illustrated by
BRICS]{.underline}+. Sino-US competition and US-Russia conflict to the
extent of proxy-war in Ukraine reflect these changes. [[The
Arctic]{.mark}, which [is]{.mark} de facto [divided between the US-led
NATO-Arctic and the Russian Arctic]{.mark}, where Russia reaches out to
the BRICS+ in diplomacy, economics, and S&T, reflects these changes to
world order.]{.underline} There is wishful thinking in the West of
returning to post-Cold War US unipolar and hegemonic 'liberal world
order' or 'rules-based order' and the circumpolar liberal Arctic order
with it. This wish is probably unrealistic for global trends in
demography, economics, S&T, legitimacy, etc. Significant conflict can be
expected between the US/West and China and Russia on developments in
world order, with the Global South standing by. [The Arctic is likely to
remain divided between the US-led NATO Arctic and the Russian Arctic
seeking engagement with the BRICS+ world for the future **[with
extremely limited cooperation]{.mark}** and risk of spill-over from the
Ukraine War and other US-Russia-China conflicts.]{.underline} The Arctic
in international order There are two common, but invalid, narratives
about the Arctic, which are poor guides for policy: [First, 'Arctic
exceptionalism', that the Arctic was apart from international politics
and allowed for West-Russia cooperation unlike elsewhere]{.underline},
especially between the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the
Russian full- scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Second, a presentist
discourse, where international interests in the Arctic are seen as
rising in the last 15 years, driven by climate change, the Russian flag
planting on the seafloor of the North Pole in 2007, and the United
States Geological Survey's assessment of oil and gas resources in 2008,
north of the Arctic Circle. Rather, [[the Arctic has for
centuries]{.mark} closely [mirrored the international
system]{.mark},]{.underline} whether multipolar with Western colonial
empires before the World Wars, bipolar Cold War between the US and the
USSR, post-Cold War US unipolarity and hegemony, or the current emerging
Sino-American bipolarity and multi- polarity. [[During
2014--2022]{.mark}, [cooperation]{.mark} in the Arctic [was not
exceptional]{.mark} compared to US-Russia non-proliferation
cooperation]{.underline}, most notably with the Iran nuclear deal in
2015, or removing chemical weapons from Syria. [There was extensive
US-Europe-Russia and wider collaboration around the International Space
Station. There was extensive energy trade and investment between Russia
and Europe, most notably with the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines under
the Baltic Sea.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- No Disease Impact

#### No Zombie viruses -- fears overblown

Isabella **Turilli** (Rhodes Scholar -- Graduate School Oxford
University -- The Arctic Institute) "Are Arctic Viruses \"Zombies\"?"
March 25, **2025**
<https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/arctic-viruses-zombies/> - Date
Accessed -- 06/28/2025//KSH

A pandemic -- a widespread outbreak of a novel disease -- is an event
that understandably stokes fear. It carries emotional weight,
implicative of "universal, lethal contagion," and finds power in the
viscerality of a mass confrontation with death. The fearsome status of
"pandemic" also comes from the world's recent experience of one; the
memory of COVID-19 lingers in the global consciousness. In the Arctic,
the concept of "pandemic" has an additional layer of complexity. In the
past fifteen years, scientists have raised concerns about pathogens with
pandemic potential surviving in the permafrost. These are bacteria and
viruses, some of which date back to prehistoric times, that have managed
to stay alive in dormant states in glacial environments. These are
samples of "giant viruses" that could infect humans have been identified
and several studies have confirmed the possibility of their "revival" --
that is, a re-activation of infectiousness after their long, frozen
dormancy. Summertime thawing of the permafrost has already been
connected to a 2016 resurgence of the bacterion anthrax in Siberia. The
possibility of dangerous or unfamiliar viruses emerging from the melting
ice, just as Arctic tourism rapidly increases, is a serious and
worthwhile topic of consideration. Between the motif of "re-awakening"
and its macroscopic potential, [the term 'zombie' has become associated
with Arctic pandemic threats]{.underline}. This moniker is present in
literary discourse around narratives of outbreak, academic research on
biothreats and ecology, and most commonly in popular science news
articles. It is an intuitive nickname for an admittedly fascinating
scientific process, but it is worth asking: what are the downsides of
"zombifying" Arctic viruses? [[The "zombification" of Arctic
viruses]{.mark} runs the risk of [perpetuat]{.mark}ing
[misunderstandings about]{.mark} the [threat]{.mark} of disease [and
i]{.mark}ts [capacity]{.mark} to spread]{.underline}. The term succeeds
in engaging an audience, but can be misleading in regard to the breadth
of the issue, the uneven dynamic of health emergencies, and the degree
of agency humans have in preventing outbreaks. The unexpected rise of an
unknown disease In the 2013 film World War Z, Brad Pitt's character is
stuck in traffic -- a gridlock that seems normal until its cause is
revealed to be the outbreak of a zombie apocalypse. Within the first ten
minutes of the film, the zombies' rise turns the world upside down. Our
inability to predict their resurrection is one of the aspects that makes
these viruses so fearsome. In the words of infectious disease researcher
Jeremy Farrar, "if you don't see \[it\], you will always respond too
late." But [we are already learning how to expect these kinds of
viruses]{.underline}. The International Circumpolar Surveillance (ICS)
program operates in eight countries, creating a network of hospitals,
laboratories, and public health officials that monitor health status and
report cases of concern. The program, which started in 1999, is a
"successful example of collaborative surveillance," supplemented by
national disease tracking units run by individual member states. [[The
United]{.mark} [States]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example,
[[operates]{.mark} the Arctic [Investigations]{.mark} Program that
coordinates with tribal communities [to "evaluate...infectious
threats]{.mark}]{.underline} that may be climate sensitive." These
efforts are also supported by the International Health Regulations, a
recently-amended treaty that outlines surveillance, notification, and
verification steps its 196 member states are bound to follow. Viruses
can only evade detection for so long, and [we have a plethora of
programs to detect their emergence.]{.underline} In all likelihood, we
will avoid "World War Z." The unstoppable spread of a zombie virus In
the 2002 film "28 Days Later," it takes less than a month for the virus
responsible for "zombifying" the public to traverse the world. But
[[would a "zombie virus"]{.mark} of the Arctic variety]{.underline}
necessarily [[wreck]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[havoc?]{.mark} Simply
put, [no]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Viruses have variable infectiousness,
and [there are myriad barriers that]{.mark} can [stop them from]{.mark}
successfully [spreading]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The most obvious
is geographical -- a virus needs a host to climb a mountain or cross an
ocean, and without one, its capacity for spread is limited. But [a
pathogen may be unsuccessful in spreading a disease even when it is able
to come into contact with a host]{.underline}. Disease susceptibility is
an elusive concept, a complex calculation balancing genetics,
environment, target demographic of the disease, medical history, living
and working conditions, and more. Most importantly, [[not all
viruses]{.mark} are able to [infect humans]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
April of last year, researchers isolated strains of defrosted
"Methuselah microbes" which are indeed virulent -- but only to amoebae.
The bottom line is that [[being exposed]{.mark} to a disease [does
not]{.mark} automatically [lead to infection]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Diseases are extinguishable in ways that the Hollywood zombie is not.
The inevitable doom of another pandemic Between its sudden emergence and
frenetic spread, the zombie -- much like the frozen virus -- conjures a
sense of doom. Yet we have reason to be hopeful about our ability to
defeat a "zombie virus." [The last century has seen remarkable [growth
in human resilience]{.mark} against outbreaks.]{.underline} Vaccination,
for example, has been nothing short of a public health miracle. The
World Health Organization's Expanded Program on Immunization has "saved
154 million lives over the past 50 years." Between 2020 and 2021, the
COVID-19 vaccine is estimated to have prevented at least 19.8 million
deaths globally. That level of success is particularly remarkable given
that it took less than a year from the first sequencing of the
SARS-CoV-2 genome to the first emergency authorization of its vaccine.
[[The world's]{.mark} current [capability to address outbreaks]{.mark}
of infectious disease [is]{.mark} historically [unprecedented,]{.mark}
and [we should not mistake]{.mark} [a virus' ability to spread]{.mark}
and cause illness [as]{.mark} tantamount to [a pandemic]{.mark}. As
frightening as zombies may be, their viral counterparts need not cause
the same type of fear.]{.underline}

High-Mortality Pandemics

[[A]{.mark} naturally occurring [pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e.,
not from an engineered pathogen) [[that]{.mark} would [threaten]{.mark}
human [extinction is a **very small** probability]{.mark}
event]{.underline}. However, historical accounts point to several
instances where disease spread played an important role in causing very
significant decline of specific populations. For example, the
introduction of novel diseases to the Native American population during
the European colonization of the Americas had deadly consequences. It is
difficult to distinguish the effects of the diseases that came with the
Europeans from the war and conflict they also brought with them.
Nevertheless, during the first hundred years of the colonization period,
the American population may have been reduced by as much as 90% (Ord
2020).

Moreover, two major pandemic events, the Justinian Plague in the sixth
century and the Black Death in the fourteenth century appear to have
been severe enough to cause a significant population decline of tens of
percent in the populations they affected. Both events are believed to
have been caused by plague, an infectious disease caused by the bacteria
Yersinia Pestis (Christakos et al. 2005; Allen 1979). While there is a
certain degree of uncertainty involved in studying these events'
societal impacts, historical accounts in combination with modern
scientific methods provide us with some valuable insights into the
effects they may have had on the societies of the time.

With respect to the possibility of a future catastrophic global
pandemic, it appears that this risk is increasing significantly along
with the advances in the field of synthetic biology and the rising
possibility of an accidental or intentional release of an engineered
pathogen. While some of the scientific efforts in the field of synthetic
biology are directed towards increasing our understanding and our
ability to prevent future catastrophic epidemic threats, the risk
stemming from these activities is non-trivial, and may outweigh their
benefits.

The Justinian Plague

The Justinian Plague severely affected the people of Europe and East
Asia, though estimates of its overall mortality vary. Focusing
exclusively on the first wave of the pandemic (AD 541--544), Muehlhauser
(2017) suggests the pandemic was associated with a 20% mortality in the
Byzantine empire. This estimate is based on the mortality rate estimated
for the empire's capital, Constantinople, by Stathakopoulos (2007) to
produce a death toll of roughly 5.6 million. For a longer time span, AD
541 to 600, which included subsequent waves of the plague, scholars
estimate a higher mortality rate of 33--50% (Allen 1979; Meier 2016).

The demographic changes associated with this high mortality led to a
significant disruption of economic activity in the Byzantine empire
(Gârdan 2020). A decline in the labour force caused a decline in
agricultural production which led to food shortages and famine (Meier
2016). Trade also collapsed. Decreased tax revenues caused by the
population decline initiated a major fiscal contraction and consequently
a military crisis for the empire (Sarris 2002; Meier 2016). In the
longer run, however, the massive reduction of the labour force appears
to have had a positive economic effect for the surviving laborers, as
the increased marginal value of labour caused a rise in real wages and
per capita incomes. These beneficial effects for the survivors were also
observed after the Black Death (Pamuk and Shatzmiller 2014; Findlay and
Lundahl 2017).

The mortality and the disruption of activity the plague caused in the
Byzantine empire also led to further direct and indirect cultural and
religious consequences. Meier (2016) particularly highlights the
plague's indirect effect of an increase in liturgification (a process of
religious permeation and internalization throughout society as defined
by Meier 2020), the rise of the Marian cult, and the sacralization of
the emperor.

The direct and indirect effects of the plague also appear to have had
far-reaching and long-term political repercussions. The societal
disruptions caused by the plague are believed to have significantly
weakened the position of the Byzantine empire and arguably led to the
decline of the Sasanian empire (Sabbatani et al. 2012). Interestingly,
the pandemic indirectly favoured the nomadic Arab tribes who were less
vulnerable to the contagion while traveling through desert and
semi-desert environments during the initial expansion of Islam
(Sabbatani et al. 2012).

Of note is the absence of a scientific consensus on the severity of the
Justinian Plague's impacts. For example, Mordechai and Eisenberg (2019)
and Mordechai et al. (2019) argue against the maximalist interpretation
of the historical evidence described above. They suggest that the
estimated mortality rate of the plague is exaggerated, and that the
pandemic was not a primary cause of the transformational demographic,
political and economic changes in the Mediterranean region between the
sixth and eighth century. Recently, White and Mordechai (2020)
highlighted the high likelihood of the plague having different impacts
in the urban areas of the Mediterranean outside of Constantinople.

The Black Death

The Black Death which ravaged Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia in
the middle of the fourteenth century is considered the deadliest
pandemic in human history and potentially the most severe global
catastrophe to have ever struck mankind. With respect to its mortality,
Ord (2020) argues that the best estimate of its global mortality rate is
5--14% of the global population, largely based on Muehlhauser (2017).

The plague created a large demographic shock in the affected regions. It
reduced the European population by approximately 30--50% during the 6
years of its initial outbreak (Ord 2020). It took approximately two
centuries for the population levels to recover (Livi-Bacci 2017; Jedwab
et al. 2019b). As the mortality rates appear to have been the highest
among the working-age population, the effects on the labour force were
acute (Pamuk 2007).

The plague\'s mortality, morbidity and the associated societal
disruption led to a major decline in economic output both in Europe
(Pamuk 2007) and the Middle East (Dols 2019). In Europe, however, this
decline in economic output was smaller than the decline in population;
output per capita began to increase within a few years of the initial
outbreak (Pamuk 2007).

The large demographic shock caused by the plague led to a shift in the
relative price of labour which, similarly to the Justinian Plague, had a
positive impact on wages. With a reduced labour force, real wages and
per capita incomes in many European countries increased and were
sustained at higher levels for several centuries (Voigtländer and Voth
2013a; Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk and Shatzmiller 2014). Scott and Duncan
(2001) point out that real wages approximately doubled in most countries
of Europe in the century following the plague.

An additional insight into the long-run relationship between the Black
Death's mortality and per capita incomes in Europe is offered by
Voigtländer and Voth (2013a). Using a Malthusian model, they suggest
that over time, the rise in income caused by the plague's mortality led
to an increase in urbanization and trade. Furthermore, the increased tax
burden (per capita), combined with the contemporary political climate,
increased the frequency of wars. Consequently, higher urbanization and
trade led to an increase in disease spread which along with a more
frequent war occurrence caused a long-term increase in mortality and a
further positive effect on per capita incomes. In this way, the Black
Death appears to have created a long-lasting environment of
high-mortality and high-income specifically in Western Europe,
functioning as an important contributing factor to its economic growth
in the next centuries (Alfani 2020). However, while in Western Europe
incomes remained elevated over the next centuries, in Southern Europe
they began to decline as the Southern European population started
recovering after AD 1500 (Jedwab et al. 2020).

Apart from the positive effects on wages, the increased marginal value
of labour combined with other factors had further economic and social
implications. A decreased relative value of land and the lack of
workforce to use it effectively caused land prices and land rents to
decrease (Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk 2007). A decreased marginal value of
capital assets in general led to a lapse in the enforcement of property
rights (Haddock and Kiesling 2002). Interest rates and real rates of
return on assets also decreased (Pamuk 2007; Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk
and Shatzmiller 2014; Jordà et al. 2021; Clark 2016).

Higher wages in combination with a relative abundance of land increased
people's access to land/home ownership, likely reducing social
inequality (Alfani 2020). On the other end of the income distribution,
decreased incomes for landowners led to an overall decrease in income
inequality (Jedwab et al. 2020; Alfani and Murphy 2017).

With respect to the effects on agriculture, the structure of
agricultural output moved away from cereals to other crops following the
plague. Furthermore, the workforce shortages and the incentives to
increase the labour supply are believed to have caused a shift from
male-labour intensive arable farming towards pastoral farming,
consequently raising the demand for female labour (Voigtländer and Voth
2013b). However, while the Black Death appears to have caused certain
structural agricultural changes, Clark (2016) finds no effect of the
plague on agricultural productivity in the long run.

In terms of other social consequences, the evidence suggests that the
plague\'s mortality reduced labour coercion, particularly throughout
Western Europe (Jedwab et al. 2020; Haddock and Kiesling 2002; Gingerich
and Vogler 2021). The increased bargaining power of labour caused by the
plague's demographic shock contributed to and accelerated the decline in
serfdom and development of a free labour regime. Gingerich and Voler
(2021) further argue that these effects may have had long-lasting
political implications and that a decline of repressive labour practices
(such as serfdom) permitted the development of more inclusive political
institutions. They find that the regions with the highest mortality were
more likely to develop participatory political institutions and more
equitable land ownership systems. They find that centuries later, In
Germany, the populations in these high-mortality regions were less
likely to vote for Hitler's National Socialist (Nazi) Party in the 1930
and 1932 elections in Germany.

However, the positive effects on the emergence of freer labour did not
take place in Eastern Europe, where serfdom was sustained and even
intensified. Robinson and Torvik (2011) attempt to explain this
asymmetry arguing that these differential outcomes may have been caused
by the varying power and quality of institutions. The authors suggest
that opportunities generated by the increased bargaining power of
labour, in an environment of weak institutions, were less likely to lead
to a positive effect than in the case of regions with stronger
institutions (with more robust rule-of-law or less corrupt or predatory
practices).

Apart from causing a negative demographic shock to the affected
populations, the Black Death appears to have caused further indirect
demographic changes, particularly in Western Europe. The increased
employment opportunities for females caused by worker shortages and a
higher female labour demand led to a decline in fertility rates and an
increased age of marriage (Voigtländer and Voth 2013b). This demographic
transition to a population characterized by lower birth rates likely
helped to preserve the high levels of per capita incomes and contributed
to further economic development of certain parts of Europe, enabling it
to escape the "Malthusian trap" in the following centuries (Pamuk 2007).
Siuda and Sunde (2021) confirm the pandemic's effect on the accelerated
demographic transition empirically, as they find that greater pandemic
mortality was associated with an earlier onset of the demographic
transition across the various regions of Germany.

Unfortunately, the Black Death also led to an increase in the
persecution of Jews (Finley and Koyama 2018; Jedwab et al. 2019a).
Interestingly, Jedwab et al. (2019a) were able to estimate that in the
case of regions with the highest mortality rates, the probability of
persecution decreased if the Jewish minority was believed to benefit the
local economy.

It is important to highlight that the long-term repercussions of the
Black Death were highly asymmetrical. While in Western Europe the
pandemic appears to have led to some long-term dynamic shifts associated
with increased wages, decreased inequality and a decrease in labour
coercion, this was not the case for other regions. A decrease in wages
was observed for example in Spain (Alfani 2020) and Egypt. In Spain, the
plague\'s demographic impact on an already scarce population caused a
long-lasting negative disruption to the local trade-oriented economy.
The workforce disruption in Egypt led to a collapse of the
labour-intensive irrigation system for growing crops in the Nile valley,
with consequent disastrous effects on the rural economy (Alfani 2020).
Borsch (2005) argues that the economic decline in Egypt caused by the
Black Death "put an end to the power in the heartland of the Arab world"
(p. 114) and to the impressive scientific and technological developments
that came out of this region.

A consensus for an explanation of the Black Death's varied impacts
across regions, and their determinants, does not appear to exist.
However, several researchers attempt to provide partial insights. For
example, Alfani (2020) considers the differential outcomes to be broadly
dependent upon the initial conditions in each region. More specifically,
both Robinson and Torvik (2011) and Pamuk (2007) propose that the
asymmetry of impacts can largely be explained by the differences in the
institutional environments of the affected societies.

It is argued that the Black Death defined the threshold between the
medieval and the modern ages, similarly to the way the Justinian Plague
did for antiquity and the Middle Ages (Horden 2021). Furthermore, the
differential long-term outcomes of the Black Death likely provided a
significant contribution to the so-called "Great Divergence" between
Europe and the rest of the world and the "Little Divergence" between
North-western and Southern and Eastern Europe (Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk
2007).

From this perspective, it would seem rational to conclude that apart
from causing substantial and long-term demographic, economic, political,
and cultural changes, both the Justinian Plague and the Black Death
likely significantly altered the course of human history.

Considering the above, it is not unreasonable to expect that a pandemic
of a similar magnitude to these past catastrophes would do the same in
the present day. However, what societal impacts a pandemic of similar or
higher mortality would inflict in the twenty-first century has not
really been the subject of any study, as far as we were able to
identify. A possibility exists, given the newly developed capacity of
humanity to create new pathogens, that the outcomes of a future
catastrophic pandemic will be even more adverse than those of the
Justinian Plague and the Black Death.

Probability

[In terms of the probability of naturally occurring pandemics,
**[a]{.mark}**]{.underline}n informal [[survey of]{.mark} participants
of [the **G**]{.mark}lobal **[C]{.mark}**atastrophic **[R]{.mark}**isk
[Conference]{.mark}]{.underline} in Oxford in 2008 [[shows]{.mark} that
[the median estimate for]{.mark} a probability of a natural pandemic
[killing]{.mark} more than [1 billion]{.mark} people before the year
2100 was surveyed [to be **5%**]{.mark}, and the probability of such
pandemic to cause human extinction was **0.05%**.
[Ord]{.mark}]{.underline} (2020) [uses a slightly broader definition of
existential risk, which apart from human extinction also includes a
permanent reduction of human potential. He [estimates]{.mark} the
[**probability** of]{.mark} an [**existential** risk]{.mark} stemming
[from a]{.mark} natural [pandemic in the **next 100 years** to be

#### No extinction from disease -- natural immunization and modern medicine solve, only 1 mammal has ever been wiped out by disease

Extinct?,\" Scientific American,

THE PERFECT STORM Will these inequities eventually lead to a
species-wide downfall? It\'s not easy to calculate the likelihood that,
say, the climate emergency will kill us all, says Luke Kemp, a research
affiliate at the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at the
University of Cambridge. But it\'s probably not realistic to consider
risks individually anyway, he says. \"When we look at the history of
things like mass extinctions and societal collapses, it\'s never just
one thing that happens,\" Kemp says. \"If you\'re trying to rely on a
single silver bullet to kill everyone in a single event, you have to
write sci-fi.\" The end of humanity is far more likely to be brought
about by multiple factors, Kemp says---a pileup of disasters. Although
apocalyptic movies often turn to viruses, bacteria and fungi to wipe out
huge swathes of the population, [**[a pandemic
alone]{.mark}**]{.underline} probably **[[won\'t drive humanity to
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** simply [because [the immune system
is]{.mark} a [broad and effective]{.mark} defense,]{.underline} says
[Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior
scholar]{.underline} at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. A
[pandemic could be devastating]{.underline} and lead to severe
upheaval---the Black Death killed 30 to 50 percent of Europe\'s
population---[but it\'s unlikely that a pathogen would kill all of
humanity,]{.underline} Adalja says. \"Yes, [[an infectious disease could
kill a lot]{.mark} of people]{.underline},\" he says, \"[[but]{.mark}
then you\'re going to have [a group]{.mark} \[[of people]{.mark}\] that
[are resilient]{.mark} to it [and survive.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[Humans]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[have tools to fight back]{.mark}
against a pathogen]{.underline}, from [[medical treatments]{.mark} to
[vaccines]{.mark} to the [social-distancing]{.mark} measures that became
familiar worldwide during the COVID pandemic]{.underline}, Adalja says.
[There is one example of a mammalian species that may have been entirely
eliminated by an infectious disease, he says: the Christmas Island rat
(Rattus macleari), also called Maclear\'s rat, an endemic island species
that may have gone extinct because of the introduction of a
parasite]{.underline}. \"[We are not helpless like the Christmas Island
rat, which couldn\'t get away from that island]{.underline},\" Adalja
says. \"We have the ability to change our fate.\"

If infectious disease contributes to the downfall of humanity, it will
probably be as just one piece of a larger puzzle. Imagine a planet
pushed to upheaval by sea-level rise and disruption to agriculture from
climate change. The humans of this climate-ravaged world attempt a
geoengineering solution that goes wrong. The situation worsens.
Resources are scarce, and a bunch of countries have nuclear weapons. Oh,
by the way, the mosquitoes that carry yellow fever range as far north as
Canada in this scenario. It\'s not hard to see how the human population
could decline and disappear in the face of an arsenal of challenges,
according to Kemp. Worst-case scenarios are understudied, Kemp says. In
climate science, for example, there is a lot of research into what the
world might look like at two or three degrees Celsius warmer than the
preindustrial average but very little looking at what an increase of
five or six degrees C might look like. This is partly because scientists
have a hard time predicting the effects of that much warming and partly
because climate scientists feel pressure from politicians not to appear
alarmist, Kemp says. Models of future worst-case scenarios also tend to
do an inadequate job of predicting the cascading effects of a disaster.
\"The general field of existential risk is relatively new, nascent and
just understudied,\" Kemp says. There are questions as to how much
humans should worry about something as big picture as extinction. While
some see the question as pressing---controversial tech billionaires such
as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel have funded organizations dedicated to
studying the risks of transformative technologies---others argue that
today\'s problems are urgent enough. Already humans are heating the
globe, overexploiting and destroying nature, using land and water
unsustainably, and creating chemicals that are harmful to all life,
often in service to the globally well-off, says Sarah Cornell, who
studies global sustainability at the Stockholm Resilience Center at
Stockholm University. \"Today\'s reality is that some human beings are
undermining or even destroying living conditions of many, many other
people,\" Cornell says. \"From a human-scale perspective, this is an
existential crisis already, not a risk somewhere up ahead.\"

### 2NC -- No Disease Impact

#### No risk of arctic disease -- zombie diseases can't spread and can be solved

Valerie **Brown** (Bullet of the Atomic Scientists) "A rising danger in
the Arctic" November 25, **2024**
https://thebulletin.org/2024/11/a-rising-danger-in-the-arctic-microbes-unleashed-by-climate-change/

[[No organisms]{.underline}]{.mark}---except possibly microbes---[[are
prepared to adapt]{.underline}]{.mark} to the unstable climate regime
the Earth has entered. Humans are far behind the curve in adapting to
the climate change they have caused with their carbon dioxide emissions,
particularly as regards the climate-driven spread of pathogens. The
tropics have been a focus of concern about climate and disease, as
warming causes insects and other disease vectors to spread away from the
equator. But while diseases from the south, such as dengue fever, Ebola,
and Zika, are clear dangers that occupy most of the attention of
infectious disease epidemiologists, [few researchers are looking for new
or ancient Arctic pathogens]{.underline} that current generations of
humans have never been exposed to. One research team described
permafrost as "a reservoir of minimally characterized microbial life"
that can hold thousands of species, very few of which have been studied.
Because [there is so little information]{.underline}, most experts
caution [that trying to assess the]{.underline} microbial
[[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} in and from the Arctic [[is
speculative]{.underline}]{.mark}. But others point out that when data is
sparse, informed hypothesizing can lead to an improved strategy for
responding to crises now unforeseen. Recently there's been a lot of
press coverage of "zombie viruses" bursting out of thawing permafrost.
The bodies of people and animals buried in permafrost a few centuries
ago have contained potentially infectious variants of smallpox, anthrax,
and influenza, but because of this risk, most scientists have expressed
little interest in studying zombie viruses---especially smallpox---in a
lab. [[There is little agreement among experts]{.mark} as to the risks
of "zombie" pathogens spreading]{.underline} into the larger world
population. Some research establishes that even very old permafrost
microbes can be viable. But Paul [Hunter, [a professor of]{.mark}
medicine]{.underline} at the University of East Anglia who has studied
Covid [and [infectious diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} related to extreme
weather, [[is not worried about the viruses]{.underline}]{.mark} that
have actually been revived from permafrost [[because "none of them are
human pathogens]{.mark},]{.underline} they're all protozoan viruses."
Further, Hunter says, [because all the "zombie viruses" that are human
pathogens are familiar, [if they are revived they can be handled with
vaccines and antibiotics]{.mark}.]{.underline} "Currently [[there's
nothing to suggest]{.mark} there would be something coming out that
would be [a new disease]{.mark} that [would infect
humans]{.mark}]{.underline}," he adds. [Much of [the]{.mark} viral [DNA
found in permafrost is degraded]{.mark}, [so]{.mark} even if the viruses
remain intact, they are [unlikely to be infectious]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But zombies may be the least of our Arctic disease worries.

Are we safe now from events like this? Or are we more vulnerable?
**[Could a pandemic threaten humanity's future?]{.underline}**10

The Black Death was not the only biological disaster to scar human
history. It was not even the only great bubonic plague. In 541 CE the
Plague of Justinian struck the Byzantine Empire. Over three years it
took the lives of roughly 3 percent of the world's people.11

When Europeans reached the Americas in 1492, the two populations exposed
each other to completely novel diseases. Over thousands of years each
population had built up resistance to their own set of diseases, but
were extremely susceptible to the others. The American peoples got by
far the worse end of exchange, through diseases such as measles,
influenza and especially smallpox.

During the next hundred years a combination of invasion and disease took
an immense toll---one whose scale may never be known, due to great
uncertainty about the size of the pre-existing population. We can't rule
out the loss of more than 90 percent of the population of the Americas
during that century, though the number could also be much lower.12 And
it is very difficult to tease out how much of this should be attributed
to war and occupation, rather than disease. As a rough upper bound, the
Columbian exchange may have killed as many as 10 percent of the world's
people.13

Centuries later, **[the world had become so interconnected that a truly
[global pandemic]{.mark} was possible]{.underline}**. Near the end of
the First World War, a devastating strain of influenza (known as the
1918 flu or Spanish Flu) spread to six continents, and even remote
Pacific islands. At least a third of the world's population were
infected and 3 to 6 percent were killed.14 This death toll outstripped
that of the First World War, and possibly both World Wars combined.

**[Yet even events like these [fall short of]{.mark} being [a threat to
humanity]{.mark}'s longterm potential]{.underline}**.15

\[FOONOTE\]

**[In addition to]{.underline}** this **[historical evidence, there are
some [deep]{.mark}er [biological]{.mark} observations and [theories
suggest]{.mark}ing that [pathogens are unlikely to lead to]{.mark} the
[extinction]{.mark} of their hosts. [These include]{.mark} the empirical
[anti-correlation between infectiousness and lethality]{.mark}, the
[extreme rarity]{.mark} of diseases [that kill more than 75%]{.mark} of
those infected, the observed [tendency]{.mark} of pandemics [to become
less virulent]{.mark} as they progress [and]{.mark} the theory of
[optimal virulence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, there is no
watertight case against pathogens leading to the extinction of their
hosts.

\[END FOOTNOTE\]

**[In the great bubonic plagues we saw [civilization]{.mark} in the
affected areas falter, but [recover]{.mark}. The regional]{.underline}**
25 to **[[50 percent death rate was not enough to precipitate]{.mark} a
continent-wide [collapse]{.mark} of civilization]{.underline}**. It
changed the relative fortunes of empires, and may have altered the
course of history substantially, but **[if anything, [it gives]{.mark}
us [reason to believe]{.mark} that human [civilization is likely to make
it through future events]{.mark} with similar death rates, [even
if]{.mark}]{.underline}** they were **[[global]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
scale.

The 1918 flu pandemic was remarkable in having very little apparent
effect on the world's development despite its global reach. It looks
like it was lost in the wake of the First World War, which despite a
smaller death toll, seems to have had a much larger effect on the course
of history.16

It is less clear what lesson to draw from the Columbian exchange due to
our lack of good records and its mix of causes. Pandemics were clearly a
part of what led to a regional collapse of civilization, but we don't
know whether this would have occurred had it not been for the
accompanying violence and imperial rule. **[The [strongest]{.mark} case
[against existential risk]{.mark} from natural pandemics [is]{.mark} the
[fossil record]{.mark}]{.underline}** argument from Chapter 3.
**[Extinction [risk]{.mark} from natural causes [above 0.1
percent]{.mark} per century [is incompatible with]{.mark} the evidence
of [how long humanity]{.mark} and similar species have
[lasted]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But this argument only works where the
risk to humanity now is similar or lower than the longterm levels. For
most risks this is clearly true, but not for pandemics. We have done
many things to exacerbate the risk: some that could make pandemics more
likely to occur, and some that could increase their damage. Thus even
"natural" pandemics should be seen as a partly anthropogenic risk.

However, there are some reasons to think that naturally occurring
[[pathogens are **unlikely** to cause]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firstly, [Homo sapiens have been
around for **[200,000 years]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the Homo genus
for around six million years [[without]{.mark} being
[exterminated]{.mark} by an infectious disease, which [is
evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[the]{.mark} base [rate]{.mark} of
extinction-risk natural pathogens [is low]{.mark}]{.underline}**.82
Indeed, past disease [[outbreaks have not **come
close**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to rendering humans extinct]{.underline}.
Although bodies were piled high in the streets across Europe during the
Black Death,83 human extinction was never a serious possibility, and
some [economists [even]{.mark} argue]{.underline} that it was [[a boon
for the]{.underline}]{.mark} European [[economy]{.underline}.]{.mark}84
Secondly, [infectious [disease]{.mark}]{.underline} has [only
[contributed to]{.mark} the [extinction of a]{.mark} **small
[minority]{.mark} of animal species**]{.underline}.85 [The [only
confirmed case of]{.mark} a [mammalian]{.mark} species
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} being caused by an infectious disease
[[is **a**]{.mark} **type of [rat]{.mark}** [native]{.mark} **only [to
Christmas Island]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Having said that, the context
may be importantly different for modern day humans, so it is unclear
whether the risk is increasing or decreasing. On the one hand, due to
globalisation, the world is more interconnected making it easier for
pathogens to spread. On the other hand, [[interconnectedness
could]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[increase immunity]{.mark}** by
[**increasing exposure** to **lower virulence strains**]{.mark}
**between subpopulations**]{.underline}.87 Moreover, [[advancements in

[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark} an outbreak might do.

3\. DISCUSSION The [large increase in international travel]{.underline}
over the last century [might be assumed to have resulted in a high
chance of]{.underline} a [devastating]{.underline} global
[pandemic]{.underline} (see e.g. \[32\]). Here [[we]{.underline}]{.mark}
have [[used a]{.mark} **general epidemiological [model]{.mark}** [to
demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[an important]{.underline}**,
yet often **[overlooked, factor]{.underline}** in the dynamics of a
newly introduced high-virulence (HV) pathogen strain is partial immunity
driven by exposures to related pathogen strains. When a HV pathogen
strain arrives in a population following an epidemic of a related but
low virulence (LV) strain, the probability of a major epidemic of the HV
strain is decreased. [[High]{.mark} rates of
[travel]{.mark}]{.underline} between spatially distinct subpopulations
can [[drive **larger outbreaks** of **low virulence
pathogens**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn [[providing]{.mark} **higher
levels of [immunity]{.mark}**]{.underline} if/when a HV strain, which
has the potential to cause a devastating epidemic, appears in the
population (Fig 4a-c). Not only did we find that the probability of a
major epidemic of the HV strain decreases when travel between
subpopulations increases, but the expected final size of the HV strain
outbreak can also be reduced. This was particularly pronounced when the
level of cross-immunity between strains was high (Fig 4i), since lower
cross-immunity levels combined with high travel rates can lead to large
epidemics due to increased mixing between subpopulations (Fig 4g). When
between-subpopulation travel was increased, the reduction in the
probability of a major epidemic of the HV strain, and the expected size,
was largely due to cross-immunity reducing the proportion of outbreaks
that proceeded to become major epidemics. If/when major epidemics
occurred, we found that they were typically larger when there was more
travel between regions (Fig 4d-e), although this was not always the
case, particularly when the level of cross-immunity was very high (Fig
4f). Partial cross-immunity against a highly virulent strain from prior
exposure to a less virulent strain is characteristic of influenza
outbreaks in different seasons. For example, it has been suggested that
individuals born before 1890 were protected against the 1918 H1N1
pandemic due to the outbreak in 1889-90 \[33\] and that individuals
infected with multiple historical seasonal H1N1 influenza strains were
protected against the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic strain \[34\]. Our
[[results suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[**cross-immunity** might
be]{.underline}]{.mark} a potential [[explanatory]{.underline}]{.mark}
factor [[as to why]{.mark} there has n[ot]{.mark} been a [pandemic as
devastating as]{.mark} the [1918]{.mark} influenza]{.underline} epidemic
in the century since, despite the emergence of a strain antigenically
similar to the 1918 pandemic strain in 2009. [Travel rates increased
substantially during the 20th century]{.underline}. As a theoretical
exercise, we obtained crude estimates of the travel rates from Europe to
the USA, comparing rates during the early 20th century with current
travel rates. For the early 20th century rates, we used registry
statistics from USA ports from 1914 to 1924 (see Supplementary Material
Section 5). Oceanic travel should approximate overall trans-Atlantic
travel in this time period, as other modes of long-distance travel were
extremely rare. This yielded the approximation λ≈ 3.6· 10-6 per day.
Conversely, when estimating current rates of travel from European
countries to the USA, approximated using data on air travel, we obtain
much higher values of λ≈ 3.7· 10-4 per day. It might be expected that
[such [a significant rise in travel]{.mark}]{.underline} in this time
period [might have **[reduced]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark}** of a global
pandemic of a pathogen [with **circulating strains** that **induce
cross-immunity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Cross-immunity is **[known to
affect]{.mark}**]{.underline} the dynamics of
**[[outbreaks]{.underline}]{.mark}** of various pathogens. Vibrio
cholera, for example, exhibits almost complete cross-immunity between
strains (a study by Koelle et al. \[35\] used a cross-immunity level of
α= 0.955). On the other hand, human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV)
has been shown to provide incomplete cross-immunity against infections
from the same virus group (α ≈ 0.6, \[36\]). It also provides low levels
of cross-immunity again hRSV infections from different virus groups (α ≈
0.16, \[36\]), and partial cross-immunity against infections with human
Parainfluenza Virus\[37\]

[**[A]{.mark}**nti**[b]{.mark}**iotic-**[r]{.mark}**esistant
infections]{.underline} kill at least 700,000 people worldwide a year
right now, according to an exhaustive report commissioned by the UK in
2014, and without any substantial medical breakthroughs or policy
changes that slow down resistance, they [[may claim]{.underline}]{.mark}
some **[[10 million deaths]{.mark} annually by 2050]{.underline}** ---
[eclipsing cancer]{.underline} in general as a leading cause. [These
deaths]{.underline} largely [**won't** come from pan-resistant
infections]{.underline}, just tougher ones. [A preventable death
there]{.underline}, a preventable death [here]{.underline}. Leaving that
aside, antibiotics, along with proper sanitation and nutrition, gird our
entire way of living. Most every invasive surgery, pregnancy, organ
transplant and chemotherapy session we go through will become riskier.
Other diseases like HIV, malaria or influenza will become deadlier,
since bacteria often exploit the opening in our immune system they leave
behind. And already precarious populations like those living with cystic
fibrosis, prisoners, and the poor will lose years off their lives. [For
all the]{.underline} warranted [gloom]{.underline}, though, Farewell
does think [[there are reasons to be hopeful]{.underline}]{.mark}. "I
don't think we are doing enough, but [the scientific community along
with many [governmental and private foundations are **very actively
involved** in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[finding]{.underline}]{.mark} [not
only new antibiotics, but new [solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} to this
problem," she said. [There's been a noticeable change in attitude and
increased urgency]{.underline} surrounding antibiotic resistance, she
said, one that she hadn't seen even five years ago, let alone twenty.
Until recently, that attitude change could be seen from places as high
up as the U.S. federal government. In 2014, former President [Obama
issued an executive order aimed at addressing antibiotic
resistance]{.underline}, the first real acknowledgement of the problem
from an administration, devoting funding and outlining a national action
for combatting resistance. Through its federal agencies, the
administration pushed to reduce antibiotic use on farms and encouraged
doctors to stop using them in excess. "[There has been a lot of
work]{.underline} done the last couple of years, much of it spurned by
\[Obama's\] National Action Plan," said Dr. David Hyun, a senior officer
for Pew Charitable Trusts' Antibiotic Resistance Project. The CDC, in
particular, has used its funding to open up regional labs that allow
them to better detect and respond to antibiotic-resistant outbreaks like
the Nevada case, he said. They ultimately hope to create an expansive
surveillance system that can easily keep track of resistance rates on a
national, state and regional level. A parallel system also exists for
monitoring resistance in the food chain, shepherded by the CDC and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. In fact, it was this sort of
[[coop]{.mark}eration [between national and local health
agencies]{.mark}]{.underline} that [enabled]{.underline} Nevada [doctors
to stop the worst from happening]{.underline}, said Dr. Lei Chen. The
swift identification of a possible CRE strain by the hospital, coupled
with the woman's medical history, led to a precautionary quarantine,
while also prompting Chen's public health department and eventually the
CDC into action. And [it [may]{.mark}]{.underline} help **[[prevent
future cases]{.mark} from [spilling into the
public]{.mark}]{.underline}**. According to Chen, the CDC has allocated
funding this year to all of Nevada's state public health departments so
they can better detect CRE and other dangerous resistant strains. Under
the Trump administration, there's no telling how these small victories
will hold up or whether they will advance. All references to antibiotics
once found on the Whitehouse.gov site have been removed, including a
link to the Obama administration's national action plan, and the fact
that they're already tried to bar USDA scientists from discussing their
work with the public while stripping funding from other public health
agencies isn't encouraging. **[[Even with the best public
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[there's no clear light at the
end of the tunnel]{.mark}. Antibiotic resistance has gradually been
worsening]{.underline}, even within the last 15 to 20 years, when
superbugs like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) first
became widely known, said Hyun. The [effort]{.underline} needed [to
develop new drugs has been in short supply, hamstrung by pharmaceutical
companies' inability to recoup the costs of bringing new antibiotics to
market]{.underline}. That's because, unlike the latest heart medication,
any new antibiotics will have to be treated like the last drops of water
during a drought, used as little as possible --- the exact opposite way
to make money off a new product. Yet, much like climate change, the
financial toll of not doing anything will total in the trillions years
down the road. And it already numbers in the billions now, according to
the CDC. Of course, we need bacteria to survive. And most need or pay no
mind to us in return. Even pan-resistant bacteria don't really mean
harm. Some have been found in perfectly healthy people, a fact that'll
either comfort you or keep you awake at night, only causing problems
when our immune system wavers. [[There's **no army of**]{.mark}
**sentient [E. coli that will]{.mark} rise up and someday [overthrow the
human race]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But barring the calvary showing up, a
new fear of ours will learn to settle in, almost unnoticed. It'll creep
in when we pick our heads up from a nasty fall that scrapes our skin
open or breaks our bones; when we wave goodbye to our loved ones before
they enter an operating room, or when we cradle our newborns into a
world teeming with the living infinitesimal, wishing there was still a
way to shield them from it as our parents once could for us. A fear of
naked vulnerability. **[[The antibiotic apocalypse will be
gentle]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if it fully arrives, but it won't be any
less devastating to the human spirit.

The **[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration **[of nuclear weapons [has
been far slower than predicted]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and this seems to
be **[[because]{.mark} the [weapons do not]{.mark} generally
[convey]{.mark} much [advantage]{.mark} to their possessor. [Dozens
of]{.mark} technologically [capable countries]{.mark} have
[considered]{.mark}]{.underline}** obtaining **[nuclear arsenals,
[but]{.mark} very [few have]{.mark} done so.]{.underline}** A key reason
for this is that the **[possession of such expensive armaments actually
conveys in almost all cases rather little advantage]{.underline}** to
the possessor. In the main, **[[they are difficult to obtain,]{.mark}
militarily [useless, a]{.mark} spectacular [waste of time,
money,]{.mark} and scientific talent, distasteful, [and]{.mark} likely
to [rile]{.mark} the [neighbors.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Moreover, the
weapons have also been **[exceedingly difficult to obtain for
administratively dysfunctional countries.]{.underline}**9

Moreover, the **[consequences of what little
[prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}**eration **[[has]{.mark} taken place have
[been]{.mark} substantially [benign]{.mark}. Those who have acquired the
weapons have "used" them simply [to stoke]{.mark} their [egos or]{.mark}
to [deter]{.mark} real [or]{.mark} imagined threats.]{.underline}** For
the most part, **[they have [quietly kept]{.mark} the weapons in storage
and haven't even found much benefit]{.underline}** in rattling them from
time to time.

**[[Nor have]{.mark} the [weapons proven to be]{.mark} crucial
[status]{.mark}---or virility---[symbols]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
although Pakistan and Russia do probably garner more attention that they
would if they did not have nuclear weapons. But **[how much more status
would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? Would anybody pay a
great deal more attention to Britain or France if their arsenals held
5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay much less if they had
none?]{.underline}** Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the world
with its economic growth? Or with its Olympics?

**[Prolif]{.underline}**eration **[[alarmists]{.mark} may occasionally
grant that countries principally obtain a nuclear arsenal to counter
real or perceived threats, but many go on to [argue]{.mark} that
[the]{.mark} newly nuclear [country will]{.mark} then [use]{.mark} its
nuclear [weapons to "dominate"]{.mark}]{.underline}** the area. That
argument was repeatedly trotted out with dramatic urgency before 2003
for the dangers supposedly posed by Saddam Hussein, and it is now being
applied to Iran. Exactly **[[how]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
**[domination]{.underline}** business **[is]{.underline}** to be
**[carried out [is never]{.mark}]{.underline}** made
**[[clear.]{.underline}]{.mark}**10 But the notion, apparently, is that
should an atomic country rattle the occasional rocket, other countries
in the area, suitably intimidated, would supinely bow to its demands.
Far more likely, **[any threatened states will make common cause with
each other and with other concerned countries against the threatening
neighbor]{.underline}**---rather in the way they coalesced into an
alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

Other analysts have sounded a much less alarmist tone, however. Some
scholars even suggested that **[a]{.underline}**n Iranian

**[unbalanced]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[volatile]{.underline}** **[Middle East]{.underline}** (Waltz, 2012).
Closer to the mainstream of Western strategic discourse, various experts
have argued that **[[despite]{.mark} the [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[of proliferation, nuclear weapons, and the [deterrent]{.mark} they
provide]{.underline}** should get (more) credit for
**[[contribut]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing, in combination with other
factors, **[[to]{.mark} what has been labelled 'the]{.underline}**
**[[Long Peace']{.underline}]{.mark}** **[among the great powers since
1945]{.underline}** (Gaddis, 1999, p. 268--271; Gavin, 2012a, p. 164;
Acton 2010, pp. 16--17). Still others have contended that **[because
nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [is]{.mark} such a [rare]{.mark}
phenomenon, [and]{.mark} since [robust]{.mark}
nonprolif]{.underline}**eration **[[measures]{.mark} tend to

**[and, therefore,]{.underline}** **[manageable]{.underline}** (Mueller
2010, pp. 95--99; Hymans 2013, pp. 293--296).

The question of whether nuclear proliferation has stabilising or
destabilising effects is not just fascinating for scholars of the
nuclear age, but also highly consequential for practical policy issues.
For in order to debate the merits of particular policy choices -- such
as preventive military strikes against nuclear facilities, grand
bargains with potential proliferators or complete nuclear disarmament --
we need to understand first how the spread of nuclear weapons s regional
and global security.

The chapter proceeds in three steps. The first section provides the
foundation for the other parts by summarising what we know about
empirical patterns of proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons
for statecraft. The second section then engages the literature on the
consequences of proliferation, focusing in particular on how
proliferation has influenced international stability. The final section
explores whether some states have been more affected than others, and
what measures these states have taken to prevent proliferation, or at
least mitigate its negative consequences.

Patterns of nuclear proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons

Nuclear proliferation is commonly defined as the spread of nuclear
weapons to states that did not previously have them. Within a broader
conceptual framework that is rarely used by scholars, yet popular in the
arms control community, this diffusion of nuclear weapons to additional
states is labelled horizontal proliferation. It is conceptually
accompanied by the notion of vertical proliferation, which refers to
qualitative improvements and increases in the number of nuclear weapons
in the stockpiles of existing nuclear weapon states. In accordance with
the typical usage of the term in the scholarly debate, this chapter
focuses only on how the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons
affects international stability.

One important empirical pattern that has shaped how nuclear
proliferation is understood concerns the way in which nuclear weapons
have spread. **[The word]{.underline}**
**[['spread']{.underline}]{.mark}** **[appears to suggest that the
established]{.underline}** nuclear **[powers have]{.underline}**
**[provided]{.underline}** **[other interested nations with (at least a
few) operational nuclear warheads.]{.underline}** **[Yet such transfers
have [never]{.mark} been [undertaken]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[Certainly, states that sought nuclear weapons have often
received]{.underline}** significant **[assistance]{.underline}** from
other nations (Schofield, 2014; Fuhrmann, 2012), **[sometimes in the
form of]{.underline}** highly sensitive **[tech]{.underline}**nologies
(Kroenig, 2010). **[Nonetheless,]{.underline}** since
**[all]{.underline}** these transfers
**[[remained]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[well
[below]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** **[[weapons]{.mark}
threshold]{.underline}**, nations seeking nuclear weapons always had to
build them indigenously. Hence, **[in reality, the spread of nuclear
weapons has meant that merely the ambition]{.underline}** **[to possess
a nuclear arsenal has spread]{.underline}** to additional states, each
of which then had to pursue that goal primarily through indigenous
efforts.

**[Importantly, since a state's national [efforts]{.mark} to turn
its]{.underline}** **[desire]{.underline}** for nuclear weapons
**[into]{.underline}** **[reality]{.underline}** **[naturally
[span]{.mark}]{.underline}** several (and sometimes **[many)
[years]{.mark}]{.underline}**, nuclear **[prolif]{.underline}**eration
**[must be conceived of as a]{.underline}** **[process]{.underline}**,
as opposed to just a single step (Meyer, 1986). This point is reinforced
by the fact that **[[29]{.underline}]{.mark}** out **[[of
39]{.underline}]{.mark}** states **[[that]{.mark} have]{.underline}**
**[[embarked]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[upon that path]{.underline}**
(Müller and Schmidt, 2010, p. 157; Mikoyan, 2012; Santoro, 2017)
**[have]{.underline}** **[[not acquired]{.mark} a]{.underline}** nuclear
**[arsenal]{.underline}**. Hence, a lot of nuclear proliferation
activity has been undertaken by nations that did not ultimately become
nuclear weapon states. Three patterns explain this situation.

First, **[[owing]{.underline}]{.mark}** not just **[[to]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** **[[tech]{.mark}nological]{.underline}**, but also
the [**[institutional]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[managerial
challenges]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of the task]{.underline}**, some
**[[nations]{.mark} simply [failed]{.mark} in their
efforts]{.underline}** to build the bomb (Hymans, 2012;
Braut-Hegghammer, 2016). Second, a few countries have chosen a nuclear
'hedging' strategy, intentionally confining their efforts to developing
the technological capability to build an arsenal quickly while
refraining from exercising that option (Narang, 2016--17, p. 134).
Third, **[[several]{.mark} states have [undertake]{.mark}n a '[nuclear
reversal', abandoning]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[their]{.underline}**
nuclear **[weapons [activities]{.mark}]{.underline}** before developing
nuclear explosive devices (Müller and Schmidt, 2010).

Introduction

[Since the]{.underline} invention and [first use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in 1945, [[predictions]{.underline}
[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} of
these weapons [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} traditionally
[[been]{.underline} **[overestimating]{.underline}**]{.mark}.1
[Despite]{.underline} all [gloomy forecasts, [only nine
states]{.mark}]{.underline} [[now]{.underline}]{.mark}adays are
considered to [[possess nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}: the United
States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France, Israel, India,
Pakistan and North Korea. Although more states have operated nuclear
weapons programmes at some point in the past 65 years -- some experts
argue that in total 39 states once engaged in nuclear weapons
activities2 -- [most]{.underline} of them sooner or [later **gave
up**]{.underline} their **[ambition]{.underline}** to acquire these
weapons. Especially since the second half of the 1980s the number of
states with nuclear weapons-related activities has become relatively
low.3 Taking into account the historical trends, [it looks like
[political]{.mark} and academic [forecasts]{.mark} even nowadays [tend
to be **overemphasizing the risks of further
prolif**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline} of nuclear weapons [**in the
near future**, for example [by **predicting**]{.mark} **nuclear [domino
effects]{.mark}**]{.underline} if new nuclear weapons powers would arise
and cause other states to develop nuclear weapons as well.4

[The difficulties in forecasting nuclear weapons proliferation can be
explained by one key factor]{.underline}: [[it is]{.underline}]{.mark}
still **[[unclear]{.mark} among academics and
policymakers]{.underline}** [[why]{.underline}]{.mark} exactly
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} [[start]{.mark} nuclear weapons
[programmes]{.mark} or refrain from them. What makes nuclear
weapons]{.underline} **[attractive or unattractive]{.underline}** to the
leadership of any state? True, [many theories exist]{.underline}. The
problem with [all]{.underline} existing theories on motivations for
states to acquire or not to acquire nuclear weapons is that [\[have\]
supporting evidence]{.underline} may be found, [but opposing evidence as
well]{.underline}. When studying nuclear weapons (non-)proliferation,
one could consider any state in the world as an individual case, each
with its own international and domestic circumstances, and with all the
changes herein during history. It is, therefore, not surprising that
[specific [explanations]{.mark}]{.underline} of nuclear behaviour
[[are]{.underline} **[repeatedly]{.underline}**]{.mark} considered
**[[inadequate]{.underline}]{.mark}** because they fail to account for
all cases -- currently more than 190 states.

Without understanding what are the motivations of states to aim for or
refrain from acquiring nuclear weapons, it is not only complicated to
forecast nuclear proliferation dynamics, but even more important: it
becomes difficult to develop policies aimed at influencing these
dynamics -- there is a risk of treating the symptoms while ignoring the
disease. This article aims at contributing to answering this key
question in the field of nuclear weapons proliferation: why do states
wish for nuclear weapons -- or not? This will not be achieved by
developing a new theory, but by increasing the insights in the large
amount of existing theories on nuclear proliferation motivations. For
this purpose the many theories developed in the past decades will be
grouped into four overarching groups. This analysis could be helpful to
future researchers and policy makers who got lost in the current
richness in theories and their critics.

Grouping existing theories on nuclear (non-)proliferation motivations
has, to a limited extent, been done before. Considering the general lack
of unanimity in this research field, it is not surprising that these
groupings also differ. To give some examples: a rather early study on
proliferation motives by George Quester, dating from 1973, counted three
groups of them: 1) military motives; 2) political motives; and 3)
economic motives.5 Scott Sagan in 1996 also developed a grouping of
three 'models' explaining why states wish to build nuclear weapons: 1)
security; 2) domestic politics; and 3) norms.6 Assembling
(non-)proliferation into four groups is also possible, as study from
2010 by William Potter and Gaukhar Mukhatzhanova, shows. Summarized,
Potter and Mukhatzhanova group all theories on nuclear weapons
(non-)proliferation motivations into these four categories: 1) security;
2) international institutions; 3) international norms; and 4) domestic
circumstances.7 Etel Solingen some years earlier (2007) defined the same
four groups, but also added a fifth one: democracy versus autocracy.8
And to mention only one more possible classification: Joseph Cirincione
in 2007 also defined five motivations for states to pursue or forgo
nuclear weapons: 1) security; 2) prestige; 3) domestic politics; 4)
technology; and 5) economics.9 These are just some examples to show that
not only the amount of theoretical groups differs, but also their
content. Nevertheless, some similarities can be noticed; although not
every author mentions the same motivational factor theories, some
overlap can obviously be noticed.

This article groups the existing theories on motivations for nuclear
weapons (non- )acquisition in four factors: 1) Capabilities; 2)
Security; 3) International Norms & Perceptions; and 4) Domestic
Political Context. The article will discuss what they incorporate
(including criticism) and why is chosen to group them in this manner. In
conclusion some implications and recommendations for further research
regarding nuclear (non-)proliferation dynamics will be presented.

Capabilities

The first group of incentives and disincentives for nuclear weapons
(non-) proliferation is summarized here as 'capabilities'. Under this
umbrella are brought together both the technological and economic
capabilities of states to develop nuclear weapons.

[Nuclear [weapons are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**not easy to
develop**]{.mark}, nor are the materials that are required cheap and
commonly available. Technologically and scientifically]{.underline} the
[most challenging]{.underline} and costly [is the production of fissile
materials]{.underline} (highly enriched uranium or plutonium).
[[Transforming]{.underline}]{.mark} the nuclear [[materials
into]{.underline} **[reliable]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and [deliverable
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[another
challenge]{.underline}** [that [requires **highly
advanced**]{.mark}]{.underline} technological
**[[expertise]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [the same]{.underline} applies
[to]{.underline} developing the [delivery systems]{.underline} for the
weapons -- in this regard, nowadays states generally prefer ballistic
missiles.10 It is often argued that [the technological and [financial
capabilities]{.mark} required]{.underline} for developing nuclear
weapons [[are an]{.underline} **[effective
barrier]{.underline}**]{.mark} [especially to]{.underline} **[less
developed countries]{.underline}** without an advanced scientific and
technological infrastructure and without the financial strength to
afford the investments needed to start a nuclear weapons programme.11

Since Pakistan and North Korea -- both relatively poor countries --
acquired nuclear weapons in 1998 respectively 2006, this argument has
generally faded away from the debate. Actually, the theoretical
assumption that capabilities influence the motivation of states to
pursue or forgo nuclear weapons, is fading away itself from the academic
debate since, approximately, the early 1990s. The capabilities theory is
dating back from the first decades of academic research into nuclear
motivations and gradually became less popular. In the first decades of
nuclear weapons existence, it was generally assumed that any state would
like to have nuclear weapons, simply because these weapons were the most
advanced and powerful military tools available. Stephen Meyer in 1984
summarized the consequences of this assumption as follows: 'If one
presumes that the incentives to acquire nuclear weapons are ever present
-- that all countries would like to have nuclear weapons -- then the
only determining factor becomes technology.'12 One could also describe
the capabilities motivation as a 'why not' principle. When a state has
the means available to build nuclear weapons, why should it refrain?
When it is, for example, rather easy to convert civilian nuclear
technology programmes into military ones, the costs of nuclear weapons
may become relatively low enough that the perceived benefits --
obtaining the most powerful weapons that exist -- easily outweigh the
negative consequences.13 Proponents of the capabilities theory regularly
claim that scientists often play a crucial role in this process. Ralph
Lapp, for example, in 1970 argued that 'research and development has
become an almost unchallenged force in directing the nation to arms. We
may speak of this as technological determinism.'14 Hans Bethe in 1985
also pointed at 'the technological imperative' with regard to nuclear
weapons development, mentioning the feeling among scientists and
government officials 'that we must use this new technology'.15 In this
respect, often an encompassing quotation of Robert Oppenheimer, one of
the founders of the nuclear weapons programme of the United States, is
presented about developing the hydrogen bomb (an improved kind of
nuclear bomb): 'When I saw how to do it, it was clear to me that one had
to at least make the thing. \[\...\] The program in 1951 \[to develop
the H-bomb\] was technically so sweet that you could not argue about
that.'16

The main evidence that the capabilities theory is not explaining nuclear
weapons (non-)proliferation adequately is the fact that many countries
have become technologically and economically able to develop nuclear
weapons, but never did so. The technological 'pull factor' leading to a
wish for nuclear weapons often seems nonexistent, at least not
autonomously. These last two words, 'not autonomously', are important,
because it may be assumed that the capabilities factor is still
important in determining motivations to pursue or forgo nuclear weapons,
even though it may not be a decisive factor on its own. In certain
circumstances, the availability of capabilities to develop nuclear
weapons may compel the leadership of a state to start a nuclear weapons
programme even if it would not have done so when these capabilities were
not available. On the other hand, a lack of technological and / or
economical means may force state leaders with a wish for nuclear weapons
to abstain from starting a nuclear weapons programme -- although this is
still a choice with its own motivations, because it could always be a
possibility to start acquiring the capabilities needed, even when this
requires tough choices on how to spend limited state budgets.17 In this
regard, the capabilities to acquire nuclear weapons may perhaps be
considered a necessary, but at itself insufficient cause for nuclear
weapons proliferation.18

Even today, there is no unanimity among scholars on the influence of
capabilities on nuclear (non-)proliferation behaviour by states. A
striking example of this lack of unanimity can be found in one and the
same recent book: in an edited volume on nuclear forecasting, dating
from 2010, two contributions come to opposite conclusions on the
capabilities factor. A chapter by Harald Müller and Andreas Schmidt
concludes that the hypothesis that nuclear weapons proliferation is
capability driven ('capability may be defined in economic or
technological terms') cannot be validated at all. The authors state:
'\[\...\] economic factors are almost completely irrelevant for the
initiation of nuclear weapons activities. Rather, it is a question of
political willingness to devote a considerable share of state's
resources to the military sector instead of, say, strengthening the
public welfare program.' And the same applies to technology, they
contend: 'There is no indication at all of a technological pull.'19 In
the same volume, however, Philipp Bleek comes to the complete opposite
conclusion: 'Economic resources and technical capabilities are
powerfully correlated with proliferation proclivity at all levels. More
highly developed states, with access to commensurately greater resources
and technical capabilities, are more likely to explore nuclear weapons
options, launch nuclear weapons programs, and acquire nuclear weapons.
Given how costly and technically challenging nuclear weapons development
is, this is perhaps not a surprising finding; some might even brand it a
resounding reinforcement of conventional wisdom. But it provides robust
evidence to counter those who argue, often citing relatively undeveloped
countries like China and Pakistan that nonetheless proliferated, that
countries' level of development has little to do with their
proliferation proclivity. More highly developed countries proliferate
more readily; less highly developed countries do so less readily.'20

Security

The traditionally dominant theory on motivations for states to pursue
nuclear weapons or not has been focussing on security. Since the
beginning of research on dynamics of nuclear (non-)proliferation this
has been by far the most supported factor explaining why states opt for
nuclear weapons. The so-called 'realist' school of thinking -- in the
academic domain of International Relations (IR) in general, but also in
the subfield of (non-)proliferation studies -- considers the world as an
anarchy. In this anarchy, states are in continuous competition and will
only be able to survive as an independent state by 'self-help', which
can be summarized as individualistic behaviour, aiming for its own power
and benefits and thus strengthening its position in comparison with
other states. Following this theory, nuclear weapons are considered to
be the ultimate tool for survival, because these powerful weapons will
provide the best security guarantee against any external aggression. Any
adversary state will think twice before it will attempt to harm the
state in question in any way, because this may ultimately result in the
nuclear destruction of this adversary itself. The only condition for
having a successful nuclear deterrent is that the nuclear weapons
arsenal should be so capacious that it cannot be totally destroyed by a
surprise attack.21 When this realist theory is strictly applied, the
conclusion should be that actually all states wish for nuclear weapons
to be able to ensure their survival within the current international
anarchic system. This may, in the end, be the case, but [most realist
thinkers agree that developing]{.underline} nuclear [weapons is not
easy, cheap or without risk]{.underline}. This has culminated into a
broadly supported nuance of the theory, acknowledging that [[only states
with **actual, pressing**]{.underline} **[security
problems]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} actively
[[pursue nuclear]{.mark} weapons]{.underline}.22

Especially the risk calculation factor is often used to explain why most
states so far did not develop nuclear weapons. This explanation is
necessary to defend the theory against its critics who state that [the
realist view cannot explain why **so few states** did actually obtain
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [considering that]{.underline} ultimately
[all states would want to]{.underline} have them and many of the
non-acquiring states have been, or still are, facing obvious security
problems. Realist thinkers generally refute this critique by arguing
that [it is not]{.underline} being [claimed that]{.underline}
[acquisition of nuclear weapons is always the best way to
improve]{.underline} a state's [security]{.underline}. [Sometimes
[acquiring]{.mark} nuclear weapons [may be a **bigger
threat**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} a state's
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark} then to forgo them, [because
a]{.underline} nuclear weapons [programme may cause more distrust and
tension among (potential) adversaries]{.underline} than would be the
case without a nuclear weapons programme. An adversary state may feel so
threatened by the nuclear weapons programme that it will launch a
military attack to prevent its adversary from acquiring them. Even more,
the adversary state may react by developing nuclear weapons itself, thus
creating a nuclear arms race and causing even more insecurity and
instability in the region. When this may be expected, realists claim,
states often refrain from starting a nuclear weapons programme.23 T.V.
Paul labels this 'prudential realism'. In his words, this is a 'soft
realist version' acknowledging that 'nations under certain circumstances
may prudently forgo military capabilities that other states see as
threatening. \[\...\] States are security-conscious entities, but their
military policies are driven by 'most probable threat' assessments, as
opposed to the worst-case assessments offered by hard realism.'24

Moreover, some more nuanced realist approaches also try to explain the
small percentage of states actually aiming for nuclear weapons by adding
levels of insecurity into the theory. From this point of view, states
that are involved in an intense and / or longstanding conflict will aim
for nuclear weapons more easily then states within a lowintensity
conflict and / or a relatively short period of insecurity.25

On the other hand, many examples can be found of states in intense
conflict situations that never started a nuclear weapons programme.
This, in turn, may be explained by an important variant of the realist
school of thinking, which emphasizes the importance of security
alliances. This variant has been one of the most supported theories for
explaining nuclear (non-)proliferation during the Cold War -- and even
up to now many analysts favour the alliance explanation to account for
nuclear (non-)proliferation dynamics. Instead of developing nuclear
weapons to assure their security, proponents of this theory argue,
states may also choose another option: seeking for an alliance with a
nuclear weapons state that is willing to promise nuclear retaliation in
case the nonnuclear ally will be (nuclear) attacked. This kind of
security guarantee, often called a 'nuclear umbrella' or 'positive
security assurance' makes a national nuclear weapons programme less
necessary and the costs, difficulties, and risks associated with it can
be avoided. The promise of retaliation by the nuclear armed ally
functions as extended deterrence towards possible enemies.26

Critics of this alliance theory question the credibility of these
extended deterrence guarantees. Extended deterrence may be more or less
credible when it functions as deterrence against (overwhelming)
conventional military threats, but would any nuclear weapons state risk
nuclear warfare because of assisting a non-nuclear ally after an attack
by another nuclear weapons state?27 Joseph Cirincione summarizes this
credibility problem as follows: 'National leaders will continue to ask
themselves: 'Would the President of the United States risk Washington to
protect my capital city?''28 Moreover, the reliance on nuclear-armed
allies seems to contradict the base realist assumption of self-reliance.
Jacques Hymans formulates this contradiction in this way: 'At the very
core of realism lies the notion that friends today may become enemies
tomorrow. \[\...\] Thus, the dominant strategy of states is to go for
the bomb themselves and thus avoid any pleasant surprises.'29

The so-called Neo-realist theory, developed since the 1970s, combines
the importance of security guarantees with the dimension of the
international system: whether this system is unipolar, bipolar, or
multipolar will influence the value of security guarantees. In a bipolar
world like the Cold War era, neo-realists claim, security guarantees by
one of the two superpowers will generally solve any security concern of
other states. In a multipolar world, which arose after the end of the
Cold War, the stabilizing role of security guarantees by superpowers is
loosened because these superpowers themselves have become relatively
less powerful.30 In a multipolar world states tend to start their own
nuclear weapons programme more easily. Neo-realists nowadays have to
admit, however, that the number of newly started nuclear programmes
after the end of the Cold War has not been that impressive.

Another rather modern realist way to defend the security motivation as
principal factor explaining nuclear (non-)proliferation against its
critics, has been the 'opaque proliferation' discussion.31 Especially
since the 1990s the concept of 'opacity', 'latency', or 'ambiguity' has
become more popular in nuclear proliferation studies. Especially realist
thinkers turn around the argument that many states are able to build
nuclear weapons, but never did so. They contend that several of these
nuclear weapons capable states did, indeed, never develop nuclear
weapons up to their final stage -- in the end resulting in testing them
-- but that they in fact developed nuclear weapons without testing them,
or at least developed the means to be able to build nuclear weapons in a
very short timeframe. This is also called 'threshold capacity' -- it
takes little time to pass the threshold of nuclear weapons possession.
This way, there are more nuclear weapons states in the world then is
usually assumed. This assumption can be used to refute the criticism on
the realist view on nuclear (non-)proliferation motivations.32

An additional phenomenon regarding the security imperative which is
sometimes mentioned by academics is that nuclear weapons may provide
deterrence against larger states and / or groups of states, but not
necessarily against smaller, non-nuclear enemies. In this regard,
much-mentioned examples of non-nuclear parties that waged war against
nuclear weapons states are Vietnam against the United States, Chechnya
against the Russian Federation, and Argentina against the United Kingdom
(during the Falklands War). Apparently, nuclear weapons are not a
hundred percent reliable security guarantee against any military
attacks.33

One may even argue, as Robert Rothstein did in 1966, that the argument
that nuclear weapons offer security is hard to prove at all. Rothstein
writes that 'It is the impact of nuclear weapons which is most ambiguous
and uncertain. Presumably they are designed to deter any enemy from
aggressive actions. But in the circumstances we can only be sure when
they fail, for the relationship between successful deterrence and
nuclear weapons is hardly clear. Obviously the enemy might never have
intended to attack at all or, conversely, could have intended to attack
but been deterred by other factors present in the situation. The
security argument is thus entirely hypothetical. It concerns what the
defender thinks he has achieved in felt security, not what he actually
has achieved.'34 Recent research by Ward Wilson also concludes that
there is no evidence in history that nuclear weapons deter enemies to
start any conflict: '\[\...\] many people take the peace that's being
experienced over the past sixty years as significant proof of the power
of nuclear deterrence. But there are some problems. First, proving the
something by using the absence of something is tricky. Second, there are
other factors that can adequately account for this period of peace
\[\...\].'35

Last but not least, it should be mentioned that few researchers
completely reject the importance of security considerations as
influencing (non-)proliferation dynamics. Many analysts recognize that
perceptions of external insecurity among state leaderships are a
necessary condition for decisions to start a nuclear weapons programme,
but that this condition alone is inadequate for explaining these
decisions; other motivational factors have to be combined with the
security motive.36

International Norms and Perceptions

The third group of motivations for states to acquire or not acquire
nuclear weapons is in this article titled 'International Norms and
Perceptions'. This cluster consists of various theories focusing on the
role of perceptions among states on the influence that nuclear weapons
could have on their position in the international community. On the one
hand, these perceptions can be influenced by **[[international]{.mark}ly
shared [norms]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [[make]{.mark} the
[acquisition]{.mark} of nuclear weapons [less attractive]{.mark} --
especially those]{.underline} norms institutionalized [in]{.underline}
[international treaties like the]{.underline} Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty ([NPT]{.underline}). On the other hand, some of these perceptions
may make nuclear weapons more favourable, because states may consider
these weapons as increasing their status and prestige. Due to the
nonproliferation norms, however, **[[status and
prestige]{.underline}]{.mark}** [may]{.underline} also [be perceived to
**[increase by foregoing]{.mark} nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. The
literature on norms and perceptions on nuclear (non- )proliferation
dynamics is rather modest37, mostly because this area of research is
relatively young. Although especially prestige as a factor of influence
on (non- )proliferation has been acknowledged early in the nuclear era
already, in-depth research on norms and perceptions as motivational
factors for nuclear weapons has been very limited before the 2000s.

The motivational factor of international norms regarding states'
decisions towards nuclear weapons (non-)acquisition may be classified in
several theoretical schools within the studies of International
Relations. Most authors label the focus on norms as Constructivism38,
but when combined with the norm-setting role of institutions and
treaties, it could also be labelled as Liberalism, Neoliberalism or
Neoliberal Institutionalism.39 Some researchers label it as
Utilitarianism.40 Although there is a difference in focus among these
theoretical schools, in this article they are all grouped into the
'International Norms and Perceptions' factor. This is conceivable
because all theories included in this group are focussing on the
normative environment41 for states in general. It should be noticed that
some aspects of Constructivist, Liberal or Neoliberal theories will be
incorporated in the fourth motivational factor of this article: the
Domestic Political Context. Especially theories on the economic outlook
of state leaders are considered to belong to the (Neo-)Liberalist school
as well42, yet this article considers these particular theories as more
domestically driven (improving the national economy) than to be
motivated by a wish to adhere to international norms.

The norms theory in (non-)proliferation studies claims that decisions
regarding nuclear weapons serve important symbolic functions, depending
on the perceived identity of the state (as well as shaping this identity
itself). Decisions in this regard are determined by deeper norms and
beliefs about what is legitimate and appropriate in international
relations. The most significant behavioural norm regarding nuclear
weapons is embodied in the international non-proliferation regime
consisting of several multilateral treaties and United Nations
resolutions, with the almost universal acceptance of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as its core.43 Jacques Hymans lucidly
summarizes the effect of this non-proliferation regime as follows: 'Most
states think of themselves as, and want to be seen as, good
international citizens. Thanks at least in part to the non-proliferation
regime, there is today a widespread acceptance by states that good
international citizens do not build nuclear arsenals. Therefore, the
overwhelming majority of states have in fact not gone nuclear.'44

A recent publication by Harald Müller and Andreas Schmidt makes strong
claims on the norm-setting impact of the NPT. Before the NPT entered
into force in 1970, they write, more than two-fifths of the states that
possessed the required capability to start nuclear weapons activities
did so. In the meantime, only a fraction of these states renounced their
nuclear programmes. After the NPT altered the normative environment,
however, the situation changed. Since 1970, less than 15 percent of the
states that have the capacity to build nuclear weapons did actually
start such a programme. Even more important, they argue, is that since
1970 almost 70 percent of all states that once started a nuclear weapons
programme ended this programme.45 The authors explain this phenomenon by
three ways in which the emergence of [international norms influence the
behaviour of states]{.underline}. First, the non-proliferation [[norms
changed]{.mark} the **[costs-benefit]{.mark}s
[calculations]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by states]{.underline}. [Because
of the broad supported non-prolif]{.underline}eration
[regime]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} its [verification and
export control]{.underline} policies, [developing nuclear weapons will
be more difficult and costly]{.underline} (technically, financially, and
politically). Second, [the international norms affect the national
balance]{.underline} [of power between groups]{.underline} (within the
government as well as the elite in general) when they differ in opinion
on whether or not to develop nuclear weapons. Third, and [according
to]{.underline} [Müller and Schmidt]{.underline} most importantly, [the
international norms **change the assumptions about what is appropriate
state behaviour**]{.underline}. The emergence of the non-proliferation
norms made clear that [developing nuclear weapons is decisively **not
'what states do'**]{.underline}, even when faced with, for example,
security problems.46

Other analyses also warn that it is difficult to prove a causal
relationship between support for the NPT and the restraint of (capable)
states to develop nuclear weapons. One might assume, these experts
argue, that states that ratified the NPT simply did not intend to
develop weapons beforehand, instead of signing the NPT under pressure of
the norm while actually wishing for nuclear weapons. One may claim that
states that ratified the NPT are less likely to acquire nuclear weapons,
but it is not clear at all that they are less likely to do so as a
consequence of having ratified the treaty.47 Moreover, critics of the
norms theory put forward that determined proliferators will do whatever
it takes to acquire nuclear weapons and that international norms are
probably the least obstacle. It is hard to prove that the NPT did stop
states from acquiring nuclear weapons, but there are enough cases to
prove that the NPT does not automatically stop states to do so -- North
Korea, Iran and Syria are examples of states that ratified the NPT but
still started a nuclear weapons programme.48 Proponents of the 'opaque
proliferation' theory, discussed above, claim that the non-proliferation
regime only made nuclear weapons programmes less visible because states
wishing for these weapons behave even more secretively than before.49

Contrary to the 'negative' norms regarding nuclear weapons, also
'positive' norms exist, following which nuclear weapons offer prestige
and great power status. Agatha Wong-Frazer describes the possession of
nuclear weapons as 'a token entitling the holder to claim a certain
major power status'.50 As long as other states adhere to these
'positive' norms, maybe even without being aware, the status and
prestige of nuclear weapons may offer the possessor more diplomatic
leverage, or, in other words, more enhanced international bargaining
power, towards these states.51 This kind of positive perceptions of
nuclear weapons is regularly labelled as 'symbolism', because the
weapons are not regarded positively because of their actual usefulness
as military weapons, but more because of their symbolic value. Nuclear
weapons are, in the perception of some observers, used to show how
modern, technological advanced, prestigious, powerful, and/or sovereign
the owner state is.52

Just like the non-proliferation norms, these positive norms regarding
nuclear weapons possession are linked to a state's identity, self-image
and (desired) position in the international community. Karsten Frey
names the positive and negative norms 'the nuclear taboo' and 'the
nuclear myth' respectively.53 Some analysts consider 'mythmakers' as an
important factor influencing nuclear weapons related decisions -- in
this article their role will be discussed in the cluster on the domestic
political context. Instead of using the term 'myths', this article
prefers to use the term 'perceptions' for this positive norms on nuclear
weapons. 'Myths' have the connotation of being untrue, while one may
argue that nuclear weapons truly give a state more international
standing.

Next to prestige in the sense of great power status and modernity states
may also be motivated to start a nuclear weapons programme just to 'gain
attention'. When a state wants 'to be taken seriously' by other states
but has little to offer, pursuing nuclear weapons will attract attention
for sure -- maybe in a negative way, but still: attention is attention.
Nuclear weapons -- or only the demonstrated intention to acquire them --
may offer states more international status than they would normally
have, which in turn may lead to diplomatic, political and economic
benefits.54

Domestic political context

The fourth cluster of factors influencing nuclear weapons motivations is
in this article entitled 'domestic political context'. The grouping of
factors under this title is more or less copied from Philipp Bleek, who
uses the terminology of 'domestic politics' for a same kind of
cluster.55 The present article prefers, however, to combine Bleek's
terminology with the concept 'domestic context' which is used by William
Potter56 , merging it into 'domestic political context'. By adding the
word 'political', domestic factors like culture, geographical situation
or technological capabilities are excluded. This cluster of domestic
political context factors has many dimensions. Although one may
criticize the diversity of this cluster, in fact the various dimensions
can all be brought back to the domestic political situation in any
state. The international situation -- security, treaties, norms -- has
nothing to do with it directly, except maybe for how this situation is
perceived and / or exploited by certain domestic actors.

Focussing on domestic political factors as drivers for decisions to
acquire or forgo nuclear weapons is a relatively new branch of nuclear
(non-)proliferation research. Although the domestic political context is
mentioned in some older literature as (potentially) influential57, the
more in-depth research into this subject dates from the 2000s. Sagan in
1996-1997 had yet to signal that there existed no well-developed
political theory of nuclear weapons proliferation identifying how these
domestic factors actually may influence decisions in this regard58, but
ten years later two pioneering studies were published by Jacques Hymans
and Etel Solingen; these studies will be described hereafter. Even
nowadays, the number of studies on domestic factors influencing nuclear
weapons (non-)proliferation is quite modest and the need for a more
sophisticated understanding of the domestic context is still being
emphasized in recent literature.59

A factor that is sometimes mentioned in literature on
(non-)proliferation dynamics, but on which no in-depth research is
known, is domestic turmoil that is perceived as threatening the power of
the state leadership. States facing domestic tensions may use a nuclear
weapons programme -- and the international condemning reactions on it --
as a method of diversion. Nuclear weapons programmes may respond to, or
even bolster, nationalist sentiments and international negative
reactions may cause a 'rallying around the flag' effect, ending domestic
dissensions for some time. By diverting public attention from
unfavourable domestic issues, the regime could strengthen its
position.60

Related to this domestic turmoil aspect, Kurt Campbell introduced the
term 'regime pessimism' as a factor of potential influence on nuclear
weapons proliferation. He argues that especially 'states in decline'
tend to consider developing nuclear weapons because they 'often suffer
from a kind of societal insecurity over future economic and security
shortfalls.' Due to this 'regime pessimism' states may use a nuclear
weapons programme to prevent the state sinking into oblivion or being
overshadowed by (regional) rival states.61

Another factor grouped in this 'domestic political context' cluster is
the regime type of countries. In International Relations studies there
exists a substantial number of studies suggesting that democracies are
less likely to engage in armed conflict against each other compared to
autocracies, and some authors have suggested that this may also be the
case regarding the development of nuclear weapons. Some researchers that
studied this hypothesis conclude that democracies are less likely to
develop nuclear weapons, and they link this trend to the international
norms and perceptions factor. Müller and Schmidt, for example, argue
that '[**[democracies]{.underline}** [show a]{.underline}]{.mark}
[relatively [higher probability to abide]{.mark} by the rule of law
[and]{.mark} to take efforts to [be **good international
citizens**]{.mark}]{.underline}.' It should be acknowledged, they admit,
that [faithful norms observation is also common]{.underline} behaviour
[among]{.underline} **[autocracies]{.underline}**. '[Abiding
by]{.underline} **[i]{.underline}**nternational **[law]{.underline}**
[and its established norms is, by and large, normal behaviour in the
international society of states]{.underline}. However, some
nondemocracies are more likely to end up in the minority that deviates
from this normalcy. Totalitarian states with a power-seeking or paranoid
leadership are more likely to breach their obligations openly or
clandestinely.'62

NSC-68 warned of a vast increase in Soviet influence and aggressiveness,
Soviet nuclear development simply reinforcedthe caution that both
superpowers were already displaying towards each other. The United
States already saw the USSR as an enemy, and the basic principles of
containment were already in place. NATO was being formed before the
Soviet test and Soviet dominance of Eastern Europe was already a fait
accompli. Having sole possession of the bomb hadn\'t enabled Truman to
simply dictate to Stalin, and getting the bomb didn\'t enable Stalin or
his successors to blackmail any of their neighbors or key U.S. allies.
It certainly didn\'t lead any countries to \"reorient their political
alignment toward Moscow.\" Nikita Khrushchev\'s subsequent missile
rattling merely strengthened the cohesion of NATO and other U.S.-led
alliances, and we now know that much of his bluster was intended to
conceal Soviet strategic inferiority. **[[Having]{.mark} a large
[nuc]{.mark}lear arsenal [didn\'t stop]{.mark} the [anti-commnist

Gaulle feel better about French prestige and having their own deterrent
made both states less dependent on America\'s security umbrella, but it
didn\'t give either state a louder voice in world affairs or win them
new influence anywhere. And you might recall that Britain couldn\'t get
Argentina to give back the Falklands by issuing nuclear threats \-- even
though Argentina had no bomb of its own and no nuclear guarantee \--
they had to go retake the islands with conventional forces.
**[Did]{.underline}** **[[China]{.mark}\'s detonation of a
bomb]{.underline}** in 1964 **[suddenly make them a
superpower]{.underline}**? **[Hardly]{.underline}**. China remained a
minor actor on the world stage until it adopted market principles, and
its rising global influence is due to three decades of economic growth,
not a pile of nukes. And by the way, did getting a bomb enable Mao
Zedong\--a cruel megalomaniac who launched the disastrous Great Leap
Forward in 1957 and the destructive Cultural Revolution in the 1960s \--
to start threatening and blackmailing his neighbors? Nope. In fact,
China\'s foreign policy behavior after 1964 was generally quite
restrained. **[What about [Israel]{.mark}?]{.underline}** **[Does
Israel\'s nuclear arsenal allow it to coerce its neighbors or impose its
will on Hezbollah or the Palestinians?]{.underline}**
**[No]{.underline}**. **[Israel uses its conventional military
superiority]{.underline}** to try to do these things, not its nuclear
arsenal. Indeed, **[Israel\'s bomb didn\'t even prevent Egypt and Syria
from attacking it]{.underline}** in October 1973, although it did help
convince them to limit their aims to regaining the territory they had
lost in 1967. It is also worth noting that Israel\'s nuclear program did
not trigger a rapid arms race either. Although states like Iraq and
Libya did establish their own WMD programs after Israel got the bomb,
none of their nuclear efforts moved very rapidly or made it across the
finish line. But wait, there\'s more. **[The white government in [South
Africa]{.mark} eventually produced a handful of bombs, but nobody
noticed and apartheid ended anyway]{.underline}**. Then **[the new
government gave up its nuclear arsenal to much acclaim]{.underline}**.
If anything, South Africa was more secure without an arsenal than it was
before. **[What about [India and Pakistan]{.mark}?]{.underline}**
**[India\'s \"peaceful nuclear explosion\" in 1974 didn\'t turn it into
a global superpower, and its only real effect was to spur Pakistan \--
which was already an avowed rival \-- to get one too.]{.underline}** And
it\'s worth noting that **[there hasn\'t been a large-scale war between
the two countries since]{.underline}**, despite considerable grievances
on both sides and occasional skirmishes and other provocations.
**[Finally]{.underline}**[, **[North Korea]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[is]{.underline}** as **[annoying and weird]{.underline}** as it has
always been, **[but getting nuclear weapons didn\'t transform it from an

**[what is most remarkable about North Korea\'s nuclear program is how

Japan and South Korea could go nuclear very quickly if they wanted

**[Nuclear weapons]{.underline}** are good for deterring direct attacks

**[turn weak states into great powers, they are useless as tools of

other states to worry more about one\'s intentions and to band together
for self-protection. For these reasons, **[most potential nuclear states
have concluded that getting the bomb isn\'t worth it.]{.underline}** But
a few states-and usually those who are worried about being
attacked-decide to go ahead. The good news is that when they do, it has
remarkably little impact on world affairs.

Gates does a disservice to the global health security community when he
draws media and policy attention to amateurs such as terrorists. Where
biological weapons are concerned, the focus should remain on national
militaries and state-sponsored groups. These are the entities that might
have the capability, now or in the near future, to develop dangerous
biological weapons. The real threat is that sophisticated biological
weapons will be used by state actors---or by financially,
scientifically, and militarily well-resourced groups sponsored by
states. So far, **[[state-level use]{.mark} of biology to deliberately

biological weapons. But this norm may not survive indefinitely.

A History of Failures

Biological warfare, which uses organisms and pathogens to cause disease,
is nearly as old as war itself. The first known use of biological agents
as a weapon dates back to 600 B.C., when an ancient Greek leader
poisoned his enemies' water supply. Throughout the Middle Ages,
especially during the time of the Black Death, it was common to hurl
infected corpses into besieged cities. And during the two world wars,
all major powers maintained biological weapons programs (although only
Japan used them in combat).

[Among terrorists]{.underline}, however, [the [use]{.mark} of biological
weapons [has been **rare**]{.mark}r]{.underline}, although groups from
nearly all ideological persuasions have contemplated it. [Recent
examples include a plot to contaminate Chicago's water supply in the
1970s; food poisoning by a religious cult in Oregon in the 1980s; and
the stockpiling of ricin by members of the Minnesota Patriot Council
during the 1990s.]{.underline} **[No one died]{.underline}** [in **any
of these instances**]{.underline}.

[The same is true for the biological warfare programs of [**al-Qaeda**
and the **I**]{.mark}slamic **[S]{.mark}**tate]{.underline} group. [Both
groups have [sought]{.mark}]{.underline} to buy, steal, or develop
[[bio]{.mark}logical [agents]{.mark}]{.underline}. For al-Qaeda, this
seems to have been a priority in the 1990s, when its program was
overseen by (then) deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, a trained physician.
With the Islamic State, evidence dates back to 2014, when Iraqi forces
discovered thousands of files related to biological warfare on a
detainee's laptop.

Yet **[[none]{.mark} of these efforts [succeeded]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[The only al-Qaeda plot in which bioterrorism featured
prominently]{.underline} --- the so-called "ricin plot" in England in
2002 --- [was **interrupted** at **such an early stage** that none of
the toxin had **actually been produced**]{.underline}. [The Islamic
State's most serious attempt, in 2017, involved a small amount of
ricin]{.underline}, whose only fatality was the hamster on which it was
tested. [Of the **tens of thousands** of people that jihadists have
murdered, not a **single one has died** from biological
agents.]{.underline}

It may be no accident that the most lethal bioterrorist attack in recent
decades was perpetrated by a scientist and government employee. In late
2001, the offices of several U.S. senators and news organizations
received so-called "anthrax letters," which killed five people and
injured 17. Following years of investigation, the FBI identified the
sender as Bruce Ivins, a PhD microbiologist and senior researcher at the
U.S. Army's Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Unlike
the others, he was no amateur or hoaxer, but a trained expert with years
of experience and full access to the world's largest repository of
lethal biological agents.

Technical Challenges

Ivins' case helps to explain why so many would-be bioterrorists have
failed. [At a **technical level**, launching a **sophisticated**,
**large-scale bioterrorist attack** involves [a]{.mark} toxin or a
[pathogen]{.mark} --- generally a bacterium or a virus --- which [needs
to be **isolated** and **disseminated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [[this
is]{.mark} **more [difficult]{.mark} than it seems**. [As well as
**advanced training** in biology]{.mark} or chemistry, [isolating the
agent requires **significant experience**]{.mark}. It]{.underline} also
[has to be done [in a **safe**, **contained** environment]{.mark}, to
stop it from spreading **within** the terrorist group]{.underline}.
Contrary to what al-Qaeda said in one of its online magazines, you can't
just make a (biological) weapon "in the kitchen of your mom!"

In addition, [there is the challenge of
**[dissemination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Unless the agent is
super-contagious, [a powerful biological attack [relies on a **large
number of**]{.mark} **initial [infections]{.mark}** [in **perfect
conditions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the case of the bacterium
[anthrax]{.underline}, for example, [only spores of a particular size
are likely to be effective in certain kinds of weather.
[State]{.mark}-sponsored [programs]{.mark} often [needed **years of
testing**]{.mark} and **experimentation** to understand how their
weapons could be used]{.underline}. Though not impossible, [[it is
**unlikely**]{.mark} that [terrorist]{.mark} group[s]{.mark} [possess
the **resources**]{.mark}, [**stable environment**, and
**patience**]{.mark} to do likewise.]{.underline}

#### \--[IMPOSSIBLE]{.underline} to figure out.

[[Biological agents are]{.mark} **particularly [ill-suited]{.mark}** [to
terr]{.mark}orists, whose goal]{.underline}, recall, [is]{.underline}
not damage but **[theater]{.underline}** (chapter 13).58 The biologist
Paul Ewald notes that [[natural selection]{.mark} among pathogens
**[works against]{.mark}**]{.underline} the terrorist's goal of [sudden
and spectacular [devastation]{.mark}]{.underline}. 59 Germs that depend
on rapid person-to-person contagion, like the common-cold virus, are
selected to keep their hosts alive and ambulatory so they can shake
hands with and sneeze on as many people as possible. Germs get greedy
and kill their hosts only if they have some other way of getting from
body to body, like mosquitoes (for malaria), a contaminable water supply
(for cholera), or trenches packed with injured soldiers (for the 1918
Spanish flu). Sexually transmitted pathogens, like HIV and syphilis, are
somewhere in between, needing a long and symptomless incubation period
during which hosts can infect their partners, after which the germs do
their damage. [[**Virulence** and **contagion**]{.underline}]{.mark}
thus **[[trade off]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [the **evolution of
germs** will **frustrate the terrorist's aspiration** to launch a
headline-worthy epidemic that is]{.underline} both [swift and
lethal]{.underline}. Theoretically, a bioterrorist could try to bend the
curve with a pathogen that is virulent, contagious, and durable enough
to survive outside bodies. But [breeding]{.underline} such [a
**fine-tuned germ** would require **Nazi-like experiments on living
humans** that even terrorists]{.underline} (to say nothing of teenagers)
[are unlikely to carry off]{.underline}. It may be more than just luck
that [[the world]{.underline}]{.mark} so far [[has seen]{.mark} just
**[one]{.mark} successful bioterror [attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} (the
1984 tainting of salad with salmonella in an Oregon town by the
Rajneeshee religious cult, **[[which killed no
one]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and one spree killing (the 2001 anthrax
mailings, which killed five).60 To be sure, advances in synthetic
biology, such as the gene-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9, make it easier
to tinker with organisms, including pathogens. But [[it's difficult
to]{.mark} re-[engineer a complex]{.mark} evolved [trait by]{.mark}
inserting **[a gene]{.mark} or two**]{.underline}, since the effects of
any gene are intertwined with the rest of the organism's genome. [Ewald
notes, ["**I don't think**]{.mark} **that [we are]{.mark} close** to
understanding how to insert combinations of genetic variants in any
given pathogen that act in concert to generate high transmissibility and
stably high virulence for humans."]{.underline}61 The biotech expert
Robert Carlson adds that "one of the problems with building any flu
virus is that you need to keep your production system (cells or eggs)
alive long enough to make a useful quantity of something that is trying
to kill that production system. . . . Booting up the resulting virus is
still very, very difficult. . . . I would not dismiss this threat
completely, but frankly I am much more worried about what Mother Nature
is throwing at us all the time."62 And crucially, [[advances]{.mark} in
biology work the other way as well: they]{.underline} also [[make it
easier for]{.mark} the good guys \[[public
protectors]{.mark}\]]{.underline} (and there are many more of them) [[to
identify]{.mark} pathogens, [invent antibiotics that overcome]{.mark}
**[a]{.mark}**nti**[b]{.mark}**iotic **[r]{.mark}**esistance,
[and]{.mark} **rapidly [develop vaccines]{.mark}**]{.underline}.63 [An
example is]{.underline} the [Ebola]{.underline} vaccine, developed in
the waning days of the 2014--15 emergency, after public health efforts
had capped the toll at twelve thousand deaths rather than the millions
that the media had foreseen. Ebola thus joined a list of other falsely
predicted pandemics such as Lassa fever, hantavirus, SARS, mad cow
disease, bird flu, and swine flu.64 Some of them never had the potential
to go pandemic in the first place because they are contracted from
animals or food rather than in an exponential tree of person-to-person
infections. Others were nipped by medical and public health
interventions. Of course no one knows for sure whether an evil genius
will someday overcome the world's defenses and loose a plague upon the
world for fun, vengeance, or a sacred cause. But [[journalistic habits
and]{.mark} the [Availability and Negativity]{.mark} biases
**[inflate]{.mark} the [odds]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is why I have
taken Sir Martin up on his bet. By the time you read this you may know
who has won.65

The bioterror WMD myth. **[Those who have overemphasized]{.underline}**
the **[[bioterror]{.underline}]{.mark}**ism threat typically **[portray
it [as an imminent concern, with]{.mark} emphasis]{.underline}** placed
**[on high-consequence, [mass-casualty attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
performed with weapons of mass destruction (WMD). **[This [is a
myth]{.mark}]{.underline}** with two dimensions.

The first involves the identities of terrorists and what their
intentions are. The **[assumption is that terrorists would
seek]{.underline}** to produce **[mass-casualty weapons]{.underline}**
and pursue capabilities on the scale of 20th century, state-level
bioweapons programs. Most **[[leading biological disarmament and
non]{.mark}-[prolif]{.mark}eration [experts]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[believe]{.underline}**]{.mark} that the risk of a small-scale
bioterrorism attack is very real and present. But they consider **[the
[risk of]{.mark}]{.underline}** sophisticated **[[large-scale]{.mark}
[bioterror]{.mark}ism attacks [to be quite small.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[This]{.underline}**]{.mark} judgment [**[is]{.underline}**
**[backed]{.underline}**]{.mark} up **[[by historical
evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The three confirmed
**[[attempts]{.underline}]{.mark}** to use biological agents against
humans in terrorist attacks **[in the past [were small-scale
]{.mark}]{.underline}**, low-casualty events aimed at causing panic and
disruption rather than excessive death tolls.

The second dimension involves capabilities and the level of skills and
resources available to terrorists. The implicit **[[assumption is that
producing a pathogen]{.mark}ic organism [equates to]{.mark} producing [a
weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}** of mass destruction. **[[It does
not]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Considerable [knowledge and
resources]{.mark} are [necessary for]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
processes of **[[scaling]{.mark} up, [storage, and
dissemination.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[These]{.underline}**
processes [**[present]{.underline}**
**[significant]{.underline}**]{.mark} technical and logistical
**[[barriers]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[Even if]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}** biological **[weapon were
disseminated successfully]{.underline}**, the outcome of an attack would
be affected by factors like the health of the people who are exposed and
the speed and manner with which public health authorities and medical
professionals detect and respond to the resulting outbreak. A prompt
response with effective **[[medical
countermeasures]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[such as antibodies and
vaccination, can [significantly blunt the impact]{.mark} of an
attack.]{.underline}**

### 1NC -- No Arctic War 

#### No great power war in the arctic and US-Sino Arctic cooperation won't resolve geopolitical tensions elsewhere. China knows they are an outsider and must tread lightly in the Arctic

Studies, School of Political Science and International Relations, Tongji

In this paper, building on Ren \[45\], we explore [the prospects for a
new Arctic exceptionalism, centered on China and the U.S. as the two
major global powers]{.underline} of the present time. At present,
signals from both countries [are mixed]{.underline}. While the
consequences [[for the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} are high, [[the
stakes for both countries are relatively low]{.mark}, **in that
[major]{.mark} economic or [military confrontation is unlikely to
arise]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., \[21\], \[27\]). The Arctic
therefore has the potential to be a place for China and the U.S. to
explore a cooperative relationship, possibly leading to better mutual
understanding and decreased tensions. [[We do not suggest that the
Arctic can resolve the deep and real disputes that divide China and the
U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}, nor that China and the U.S. dominate Arctic
affairs, simply that the Arctic can provide a venue for a different
approach between the two countries. At the very least, Arctic
cooperation can benefit the Arctic. More optimistically, Arctic
cooperation can provide an alternative to belligerent rhetoric and
confrontation (e.g., \[25\]). We begin by reviewing the concept of
Arctic exceptionalism and China's history of engagement with Arctic
affairs. We then discuss China-U.S. relations regarding Arctic policy,
acknowledging the role of multilateral arrangements, but recognizing
that in the first half of the 21st century, China and the U.S. are the
world's main foci of global geopolitical power. Next, we explore the
potential for further collabo- ration in the Arctic, noting areas where
China and the U.S. may also compete for influence. We conclude with
thoughts about further research and action in this area. 2. Arctic
exceptionalism over time [The idea of [Arctic
exceptionalism]{.mark}]{.underline} started with a speech by Mikhail
Gorbachev, Secretary-General of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,
in the Arctic port and naval base of Murmansk on 1 October 1987 \[15\],
in which he [called for making the Arctic "a genuine zone of peace and
fruitful cooperation."]{.underline} The basic idea was to separate
Arctic affairs from the broader confrontation between the Soviet Union
and the West. Over [the]{.underline} next few decades, Gorbachev's
[vision became reality, at least in part. The Arctic Council was created
in 1996 and provides a cooperative forum]{.underline} for discussing
Arctic issues \[1\]. [Cooperative agreements on search and rescue \[2\]
and on oil spill response]{.underline} \[3\] in the Arctic have been
signed by Arctic states. [The Central Arctic Ocean (CAO) Fisheries
Agreement]{.underline} was signed in 2018 and [came]{.underline} into
force [in 2021.]{.underline} This agreement includes the five Arctic
coastal states (Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the U.S.) as well
as the European Union, Iceland, Japan, the People's Republic of China,
and the Republic of Korea \[16\]. In addition, there are many examples
of cooperation on smaller scales, from the delivery of fuel to Nome,
Alaska, by the ice-strengthened Russian vessel Renda after sea ice had
formed in the fall of 2012 after storms disrupted the usual summertime
delivery \[46\], to the joint sub- mission to the International Maritime
Organization of a proposal for shipping routes in the Bering Strait,
which was adopted in 2018 \[29\] despite Russia-U.S. tensions over
Crimea and other matters. Although Arctic exceptionalism has been held
as an alternative model for international relations, some [scholars have
questioned the degree to which Arctic exceptionalism [reflects a]{.mark}
deep commitment to peaceful relations, or simply [the difficulty of
conducting military or commercial enterprises in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} \[12,37,47\]. Arctic sea ice provides
convenient cover for military submarines \[39\], suggesting limits to
the Arctic as a "zone of peace." Russian military ambitions and
activities in the Arctic \[42,43\] and responses such as the U.S.
Department of De- fense's Arctic strategy \[35\] have further undermined
the notion that the Arctic is somehow separate from wider issues of
international relations. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to a
pause in the Arctic Coun- cil's activities and a sharp decrease in
cooperation of all kinds involving Russia (e.g., \[20\]). Regardless of
how substantive it was in the first place, Arctic exceptionalism would
appear to have run its course. [A new Arctic exceptionalism, centered on
China and the U.S., would likely resurrect some aspects of the
Russian-led version]{.underline}. For example, cooperation would
emphasize civilian affairs such as governance, eco- nomic activity, and
research. [Military activities]{.underline} of some kinds
[would]{.underline} likely [continue]{.underline}, but [with less
publicity and emphasis]{.underline}. In other ways, the China-U.S.
version would differ substantially. Most obviously, China has no Arctic
territory. Other than activities in the high seas, all of China's Arctic
work would require some degree of cooperation with one or more of the
Arctic states. [While Russia and the U.S. could always justify military
activity as either taking part within their territory or to defend a
shared border, any military activity by China would clearly be directed
at projecting its influence into a new geographic area.]{.underline} In
other words, China will always be a visitor to the Arctic, regardless of
what and how much it does, so [[there will always be an imbalance in the
Arctic roles of China and the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 2NC -- No Arctic War 

#### The Arctic is stable and politically insulated from warming

What could lead to a serious conflict in the Arctic? A story from nearly
20 years ago might provide some clues. It was a cold autumn and the sea
was rough. Norwegian Coast Guard inspectors were on duty and were far
out to sea, about to board the Russian trawler Electron, as they had
noticed the vessel was not abiding by protocols. What followed next put
Norwegian diplomacy to the test. The Russian fishermen took the
Norwegian inspectors into Russian waters, and were pursued by Norwegian
Coast Guard ships and helicopters. It later emerged that the Norwegian
Naval Special Operations Command had also been mobilised. Could have
ended differently today After delicate diplomatic efforts, Norway
managed to get the Russian authorities to instruct the trawler to
release the Norwegians and hand over Electron's vessel documents. The
Coast Guard is part of the Norwegian defence. To avoid escalating the
conflict, it was crucial that the Russian Northern Fleet was kept out of
the area. "The Electron incident occurred in 2005. If this had happened
in 2024, it\'s not certain it would have ended as well," Andreas
Østhagen says. He is a senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen
Institute (FNI). He studies Arctic geopolitics, seeking to identify
factors that could lead to dangerous security flare ups in the Arctic.
Everything that could have gone wrong "When thinking about potential
conflict in the North, it\'s precisely a scenario like the Electron case
that could spiral out of control," Østhagen says. What would have
happened if the fishery inspectors were armed? What if the weather had
been good enough for the marines to board the ship? What if the admirals
of the Russian Northern Fleet were not interested in de-escalation? Many
things could have gone wrong, contributing to an escalation of the
conflict rather than keeping the tumult at as low a level as possible.
Østhagen envisions two scenarios for conflict in the North: A low-scale
incident that escalates or a full-blown crisis, which, in that case,
would be linked to something much larger than the Arctic where Russia
plays a key role. He references the situation in Ukraine and the
currenty global instability. "There is no doubt that interest in the
Arctic is increasing, both commercially and in terms of a geopolitical
power play," he says. Geopolitics deals with how a country\'s politics,
history, and society are shaped based on its geography.

**[The situation is calmer than expected]{.underline}** But Østhagen
believes there are three major misconceptions about geopolitics in the
Arctic: The first is the possibility of war in the Arctic. The second is
that there are unresolved borders in the Arctic and that a resource race
is underway. The third is that climate change is the primary catalyst
for all changes in the Arctic region. "The [reality is much
calmer]{.underline}," Østhagen says. "The [Electron case illustrates
well everything that can go wrong. But it also shows why]{.underline}
**[[things usually don't go wrong. There\'s a willingness to
cooperate]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" Svein Vigeland Rottem says. [He is a
senior researcher at FNI and studies cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Rottem and Østhagen do not agree that the Arctic is
a powder keg and a dangerous place, as recently stated by Lars Saunes,
former head of the Norwegian Navy, to Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation
NRK. [Myth 1: The possibility of war in the Arctic]{.underline}
Østhagen, addressing the misconception of imminent war in the Arctic,
explains that the [[conditions in the Arctic are]{.mark} often more
[stable and transparent]{.mark} than many assume]{.underline}.
[**[Conflict is not easily triggered]{.underline}**,
[considering]{.underline}]{.mark} [the vast areas and diverse countries
involved]{.underline}. Østhagen emphasises the **[[enormity of the
Arctic,]{.underline}]{.mark}** which [encompasses eight countries, four
million people, and extensive ocean areas. The countries include Russia,
the Nordic states, the USA, and Canada.]{.underline} He notes that the
[significant Russian presence]{.underline} -- with almost half of the
Arctic landmass under Russian control -- [influences perceptions of
geopolitics in the North]{.underline}. [Iver B. Neumann, a Russia
researcher and director at the FNI, concurs that **the Arctic is [less
likely to witness]{.mark} armed [conflict than other]{.mark} global
[locations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} He believes the primary driver for
military conflict in the Arctic is Russia\'s use of Murmansk as a base
for nuclear weapons. "There are three main ways to keep such weapons
mobile: in aircraft, on land by rail, and at sea on submarines. Where
such submarines exist, as in Murmansk, there is also significant
military attention. And where there is military attention, there is also
the potential for conflict," he says. Neumann advises caution in
responding to Russia\'s desire for global attention and military
control, stressing the importance of Norway maintaining a cool head,
enforcing sovereignty, and not succumbing to intimidation. [Myth 2:
Unresolved borders and a race for resources]{.underline} As the Arctic
becomes more accessible due to melting sea ice because of climate
change, [a common myth suggests a scramble for resources and land in the
North will occur]{.underline}. But Østhagen clarifies that, [unlike in
other parts of the world, [there are almost **no disputes over Arctic
borders**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} "All the borders are settled," he
says, noting that [the last conflict between Canada and Greenland was
resolved in 2022.]{.underline} [[Maritime boundaries are key]{.mark} for
resource management and potential conflict]{.underline}. Law of the sea
grants coastal states sovereign rights for resource exploitation in
their economic zones. In the Arctic, [[only one]{.mark} maritime
boundary [remains unresolved]{.mark}. It is [between the USA and
Canada]{.mark} -- two [close allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Østhagen, who
wrote his PhD on maritime disputes, foresees [**no major concerns**
regarding]{.mark} sovereignty or [territorial
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. He believes the [myth persists due to
historical reasons but]{.underline} emphasises that, with all the land
borders settled and just one disputed sea border, [**[Arctic resources
are already distributed]{.mark}** among the eight Arctic
states.]{.underline} [Myth 3: Climate change drives all shifts in the
Arctic [A]{.mark} third [myth suggests]{.mark} that [climate change is
the]{.mark} main [driver]{.mark} for all political shifts in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [But Østhagen **[caution]{.mark}**s [against
oversimplifying]{.mark} the issue]{.underline}, noting that while
climate change does affect fish migration -- leading to potential future
conflicts around resource-rich areas like Svalbard -- it\'s important to
be specific about which aspects of climate change increase conflict
risks. Another claim Østhagen addresses is [the notion that Russia's
military buildup in the Arctic is climate change-driven]{.underline}. He
suggests that this [is only partially true]{.underline}, as Russia is
generally strengthening its military. The Arctic, traditionally seen as
secure due to inaccessibility and ice cover, hosts many of Russia's
nuclear weapons. "Putin's aim to rebuild Russia as a military
superpower, with credible nuclear deterrence, involves deploying weapons
to strategic locations like the Kola Peninsula," Østhagen says. With
climate changes, increased shipping activity in Russian Arctic waters
becomes more feasible. "Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that
Russia wants to maintain control over its northern territories," the
researcher says. However, according to Østhagen, [[Russia's military
buildup]{.mark} in the region [is more about]{.mark} relations with
[NATO than]{.mark} the changing [climate]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### No arctic war\-\--deterrence and alliance failures prevent conflict

In other words, even if -- for now -- Beijing is ostensibly Moscow\'s
\'strategic partner\' in the area, that cannot last beyond whatever the
endgame in Ukraine may be. China is by far the dominant partner in what
is starting to look like rather an uneasy partnership. Russia is looking
increasingly worried about China\'s operations in the Arctic, and their
military and commercial activity is starting to look to be in direct
proportion to one another. [The longer-term strategic conundrum must be
whether a China/Russia alliance in the Arctic is possible and
sustainable,]{.underline} in which case what would be the consequences
for the west? Or on the other hand, what would happen if their interests
diverged or clashed? They are great rivals for energy, as well as
allies. Russia and China are neighbours with a tortured history. The
Chinese-Russian border is the sixth longest in the world and one of the
least settled. Several times in recent history, Russia ceded some land
-- mostly uninhabited islands -- to China, but there are long running
tensions over Chinese colonisation north of the Amur River, and with
regard to Outer Manchuria. Those [[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} may
well [[make any possible Sino/Russian alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the Arctic [[less likely]{.underline}]{.mark}. The general
re-[[militarisation]{.mark} of the Arctic [by both Russia]{.mark},
potentially [China]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} by [NATO]{.mark} [can be well
justified]{.mark} [in]{.mark} terms of
[self-defence]{.mark},]{.underline} strategic positioning against
anticipated future changes (commercial opportunities); and may well
constitute a modern form of the cold war theology of Mutually Assured
Destruction, which deterred either side from firing the first shot in
any potential nuclear exchange. Arctic rearmament may similarly be
thought of as a kind of deterrence. [Remilitarisation is a
self-fulfilling prophesy. "We know what you are up to and what assets
you hold in the Arctic and Atlantic; we understand your 'bastion'
concept with regard to the North Atlantic; and we can monitor/deter your
shipping and submarines in the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap
(GIUK)."]{.underline} All of that is fine. I have always rather believed
in the concept encapsulated in the motto of my own old Regiment, the
Honourable Artillery Company; "Arma Pacis Fulcra" -- Arms are the
Balance of Peace. So the build-up of military capabilities in the Arctic
need not of itself herald military action or confrontation. Indeed, you
could well argue that roughly [[equal military capabilities actually
reduces military tensions and the likelihood of war rather than
increasing it]{.underline}]{.mark}. Putin, for example, has demonstrated
time and again that he takes advantage of perceived weakness (Georgia,
Chechnya, Ukraine); but that he treats strength warily (NATO as a whole,
Poland, the Baltic states in particular) which he has -- at least so far
-- left strictly alone. But that must not be an excuse for complacency
or for disarming. It must be a spur to increasing military strength so
that Russia can be in no doubt what would happen if they stepped out of
line. Had NATO acted more decisively in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea,
most observers would agree that the current war in Ukraine could have
been avoided. Military indecision or inactivity in the Arctic could well
have a similar outcome in the years to come. In the famous words of
Frederick the Great, "Diplomacy without arms is like music without
instruments."

3\. The difficulty of the problem

[The main reason why scientists and policymakers are **skeptical** of
**existential biorisk** is that [it is **terribly hard** to engineer a
pandemic that kills everyone]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[First, [you would need to reach]{.mark} **everyone**. The virus would
have to be transmitted to [the most]{.mark} rural and [isolated
**corners**]{.mark} **of the earth**; to antarctic **research
stations**; to **ships** at sea, including nuclear submarines on
uncharted, long-term and isolated paths; to doomsday preppers in their
**bunkers**; to hermits and uncontacted tribes; to astronauts in space;
to **each new child born every second**; to **island nations**; and so
on. [And you]{.mark} would [need]{.mark} a **[transmission]{.mark}
mechanism** [that could spread]{.mark} the virus this far [without being
**detected**]{.mark}]{.underline}: otherwise, those with the means would
be whisked away to safety and might well survive.

[Second, you would need a virus that was virtually **undetectable**
until all, or nearly all humans had been infected]{.underline}. That
conflicts in a stark way with the goal of producing a virus that is 100%
lethal, since [lethal viruses tend to **leave a trace** as they spread
through a population.]{.underline}

[Third, you would need a virus that is **unprecedentedly infectious**.
The virus would need to be capable of being transmitted, **without
fail**, to every human being on the planet, in sufficient quantities to
actually make them sick. [It]{.mark} would [need to avoid]{.mark}
respirators and other forms of **[protective
equipment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And it would have to maintain its
transmissibility throughout many generations of mutation.

[Fourth, you would need a virus that is **unprecedentedly lethal**,
[killing]{.mark} not 90%, 99%, or 99.999% but effectively [all]{.mark}
of those [infected]{.mark} by it, no matter their **age, health, or
genetic makeup**. This lethality would need to be preserved [even
against the best]{.mark} **medical [treatments]{.mark}**, including
quite possibly vaccines or synthesized antibodies. And it would have to
be [maintained throughout many generations of **mutation**]{.mark}
despite selective pressures towards less lethal variants.]{.underline}

[Fifth, you would need to find a way to **evade** basic public **health
measures** such as masking and social distancing.]{.underline} This
isn't as easy as it sounds. How do you transmit a virus to someone who
doesn't leave their house?

[Sixth, [you would need]{.mark} the technological [capability]{.mark}
and equipment [to **synthesize**]{.mark} the hypothesized biological
agent, something it is widely agreed [that **humanity**
]{.mark}**currently [lacks]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Finally, you would need to find someone ~~crazy~~ **\[fanatical\]**
enough to manufacture and deploy this biological agent, yet also
**competent** enough to pull it off, which we have seen is no easy
feat.]{.underline}

I am not sure if I would go so far as to say that the above is
physically impossible. But without a very good argument, we [should
regard it as [**highly implausible** that]{.mark} **all** of [the above
will come to pass]{.mark}]{.underline} by the end of the century.

4\. Human history

We have experienced a great number of catastrophic pandemics throughout
human history. These pandemics have all fallen far short of existential
catastrophe: indeed, they have often failed to cause even local forms of
societal collapse, and only extremely rarely if ever caused a region to
become uninhabited for any significant amount of time.

One of the best known pandemics is the \`Black Death' which swept Europe
from 1346 to 1352. Though the pandemic led to massive loss of life,
there was little evidence of societal collapse or even breakdown of
large-scale social institutions. The historian John Haldon and
colleagues write:

Claims of mortality rates of as much as 50% give the impression that
this event must have been devastating for the societies affected. Yet
when we examine how different states and societies responded, we find
that---without minimizing the terrible impact on people and
communities---the medieval world did not grind to a halt, still less did
a series of revolutionary transformations occur. Indeed, the Black Death
struck at the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, and in spite of its
demographic impact both the kingdoms of England and France continued to
field effective armies, even if there was a brief pause in hostilities
(similar to contemporary calls for ceasefires in ongoing international
conflicts in the context of COVID-19). Instead, some societal
developments that were already under way accelerated while various
groups within society responded by exploiting their situation and
attempting to slow down, stop or otherwise control changes which they
perceived as disadvantageous.

Still more [**[devastating pandemics]{.mark}**, combined with other risk
hazards such as brutal colonial expansion, have still been frequently
[**unable** to produce even **regional**]{.mark} **societal
[collapse]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For example, the political scientist
Alberto Diaz-Cayeros and colleagues study the combined effect of
pandemic, violence and other colonialist disasters on Mexico from the
mid-1500s onwards. Despite dramatic loss of life (average settlement
population fell 95% by 1646), most settlements survived, and 13% even
grew by the end of the colonial period. They write:

We develop a new disaggregated dataset on pre-Conquest economic,
epidemiological and political conditions both in 11,888 potential
settlement locations in the historic core of Mexico and in 1,093 actual
Conquest-era city-settlements. Of these 1,093 settlements, we show that
36% had disappeared entirely by 1790. Yet, despite being subject to
Conquest-era violence, subsequent coercion and multiple pandemics that
led average populations in those settlements to fall from 2,377 to 128
by 1646, 13% would still end the colonial era larger than they started.

[Human [history]{.mark} is replete with such examples [of
**resilience**]{.mark} not only to pandemics, but also [to]{.mark} the
**combination** of [pandemics with]{.mark} numerous [other
catastrophes]{.mark}. If our ancestors could survive and flourish with
little in the way of modern medical knowledge or technology, then we
should become relatively more confident in our own ability to survive
future pandemics.]{.underline}

5\. Mammalian history

It is not just human history that provides tales of resilience.
Throughout history, [there is only **one** recorded instance in which
disease has led to the extinction of a **mammalian
species**]{.underline}. Don't take it from me -- here are Piers Millett
and Andrew Snyder-Beattie:

The number of mammalian species that have gone extinct due to disease
(as opposed to other factors) is very limited, with just 1 confirmed
example.

The confirmed example is [the extinction of a species of **rat** in a
very small and remote location (**Christmas Island**).]{.underline}

While we might take the relatively larger incidence of disease-driven
extinction in non-mammalian species as evidence of the threat posed to
such species, if the closest thing to a mammalian extinction that we can
pin on pandemic disease is the extinction of an isolated species of rat,
then we should be hesitant to place too much stock in the idea that
humanity is soon to be driven extinct by disease.

6\. Everything, everywhere all at once

[Effective altruists often draw attention to experiments in which a
**single feature** of a virus was **manipulated**: for example, the
virus was made more **virulent** or more **transmissible**. But that is
not what [**omnicidal actors** need]{.mark}. They need [a virus]{.mark}
which is [improved on a **great number of dimensions at once**]{.mark}:
it must be quite virulent; highly transmissible; have the desired
incubation time; resist likely treatments and antibodies; survive
storage and transportation across the globe; and so on.]{.underline}

[The problem is that [we do not know how to induce **all** of
these]{.mark} many mutations at **once**, and indeed there is a good
chance that work done to produce [one mutation may **cut against other**
desired mutations]{.mark}.]{.underline} A bioweapons expert interviewed
by Filippa Lentzos explains:

I do not think that it's very easy to create weapons of mass destruction
with biological weapons.

Ray Zilinskas' book on the Soviet programmes, for example, points out
how very, [very [hard]{.mark} it is [to engineer something]{.mark} which
is [usable]{.mark} in that context]{.underline}. He lists 12 criteria
that you want in your pathogen for it to be a useful biological warfare
agent, and they include things like survivability in the air,
survivability through whatever mechanical forces are brought to bear
during dispersion, resistance to common antibiotics or anti-viral agents
so that the enemy can't simply treat the disease, high transmissibility
etc. In evolutionary terms, normally as transmissibility increases,
pathogenicity decreases; so you're having to fight nature in trying to
create a perfect biological weapon.

Some of the key lessons that came out of the Soviet programme go to this
issue of pleiotropy, where a single gene affects more than one
characteristic. And if you change that gene to improve one of the
characteristics you're going for in that list of 12, the chances are
you're going to diminish one or more of the other characteristics that
are desirable. So getting something that works is extraordinarily
difficult.

(Let me add for legal reasons that the existence of a Soviet bioweapons
program is contested. So is the fact that someone cracked Kasparov over
the head with a chessboard when he spoke out about certain issues. Make
of that comparison what you will.)

[How bad is the problem? Bad enough that [an extremely
**well-funded**]{.mark}**, decades-long [Soviet]{.mark} bioweapons
[program]{.mark}** [was]{.mark} likely [unable to come close]{.mark} to
overcoming it]{.underline}. The biosecurity expert continues:

In the 20 years of the Soviet programme, with all the caveats that we
don't fully know what the programme was, but from the best reading of
what we know from the civil side of that programme, they really didn't
get that far in creating agents that actually meet all of those
criteria. They got somewhere, but they didn't get to the stage where
they had a weapon that changed their overall battlefield capabilities;
that would change the outcome of a war, or even a battle, over the
existing weapon systems available to them.

Of course, we can insist that designer viruses with all of the
characteristics an omnicidal agent would like them to have are just
around the corner. But we should not pretend that manufacturing such
viruses is an easy task, or that historical programs and experiments
provide any significant evidence in favor of the possibility of
manufacturing such viruses.

7\. Conclusion

This post, and its immediate successors, will give preliminary reasons
to doubt published estimates of near-term existential biorisk. So far,
we have seen that engineering biological events that lead to existential
catastrophe is a very difficult problem; that biological events have
rarely led to mammalian extinction; and that producing all of the needed
mutations at once is so difficult that a well-funded (alleged) Soviet
bioweapons program didn't come close.

[Even [experts have a hard time enhancing **disease pathogens**.
Some]{.mark} observers have also [expressed concerns]{.mark} that
**[synth]{.mark}**etic **[bio]{.mark}**logy [could]{.mark} be used to
[enhance]{.mark} the [virulence]{.mark} or increase the transmissibility
of known pathogens, creating novel threat agents]{.underline}.

Mousepox and [**[bird flu]{.mark}** (H5N1) experiments [are]{.mark}
frequently [cited]{.mark} to demonstrate how dangerous new pathogens
could be designed. But assessments of this threat tend to overlook a
salient fact: In both these experiments, the [researchers did not
**actually** design the pathogens]{.mark}.]{.underline} With respect to
H5N1, researchers had indeed been trying to design an air-transmissible
virus variant for some time, without success. The ferret experiment was
set up as an alternative approach, to see whether natural mutations
could generate an air-transmissible variant. [The [researchers had no
**influence** on]{.mark} the specific [mutations]{.mark}
induced]{.underline}. In the mousepox experiment, researchers inserted
the gene for interleukin-4 into the mousepox virus to induce infertility
in mice and serve as an infectious contraceptive for pest control. The
result---that the altered virus was lethal to mice---was unanticipated
by the researchers. In other words, it was not planned.

Moreover, [some of the [key lessons]{.mark} that came out of the
extensive Soviet program to weaponize biological agents [involve]{.mark}
the [**trade-offs** between improving characteristics]{.mark} that are
"[desired" in]{.mark} the context of a **[bioweapons]{.mark}**
program---such as virulence---[and diminishing]{.mark} other [equally
"**desired**" characteristics, such as **transmissibility** or
**stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pleiotropic effects---that is, when
a single gene affects more than one characteristic---and genetic
instability are common in microorganisms. While it is too simple to say
that increased transmissibility will always be associated with reduced
virulence, this is often the case for strains produced in laboratories.

**Complexity nullifies the threat.**

pbr\]

The second factor is "the perceived complexity of the innovation in
terms of adoption and use".40 This is important in the innovation
literature, as Rogers remarked, ["\[t\]he [complexity of]{.mark} an
**[innovation]{.mark}**, as perceived by members of a social system, [is
**negatively** related to its rate of
**adoption**]{.mark}"]{.underline}.41 [Several scholars of terrorist
innovation have also highlighted the issue of complexity;42 or, as
Cragin et al have stated]{.underline}, "\[h\]ow simple or complex a
technology appears affects [perceptions]{.underline} of how risky it
will be to adopt."43

[In [most]{.mark} cases [terrorist **groups**]{.mark} appear to have
largely [opted for the simplest **pathway**]{.mark} towards the
achievement of their goals and the weapons used tend to be vernacular,
functional devices [drawing on local and readily-available
**materials**, rather than sophisticated]{.mark}, "baroque"
**[technologies]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [This is certainly the case with
IEDs]{.underline}, the history of which is characterised largely by
incremental innovations -- although nevertheless frequently effective
ones -- with many means of delivery recycled from the past.44
[[Complexity]{.mark} can therefore be seen as **important** in the
adoption of technology by terrorists generally, but [is]{.mark} perhaps
particularly [acute in the case of **CBW
technology**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Some CBW can be relatively simple: "chlorine-augmented, vehicle-borne
IEDs," as employed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) from 2006 to 2007 are not
sophisticated weapons.45 Attacks on chemical production facilities, an
apparent tactic of Serbian forces in the early to mid-1990s,46 employed
relatively simple technologies -- specifically explosives -- with
toxicity a secondary by-product. Direct contamination of food,47 drink48
or healthcare products49 does not require particularly sophisticated
technology for the purposes of delivery -- although may require some
considerable skill to culture and scale-up a biological agent -- and has
been a common approach in European CBW incidents.50 Similarly, the
contamination of water systems, something familiar to Europe,51 can also
be relatively easily attempted. However, in **[most cases]{.underline}**
such methods [of **dissemination** have generated results that are far
short of the "**mass destruction**" that CBW are **associated** with,
although this does not mean such a **possibility** can be ignored by
those working on public health **preparedness**.]{.underline}

[Although some relatively simple approaches could cause significant
harm, [mass casualty attacks]{.mark} still [require **considerable
expertise**]{.mark}, something [particularly]{.mark} acute [in the
**context** of bio]{.mark}logical [weapons]{.mark}.52 The most effective
route to weaponising biology is arguably through the process of
**[aerosolising]{.mark}** agents, something recognised mid-way through
the last century as opening up the theoretical possibility of using
biological weapons on a gigantic scale.53]{.underline}

[However, realising such theoretical potential [is difficult]{.mark} and
[it took states **decades** to develop]{.mark} more [predictable
**biological weapon**]{.mark}**s**,54 and [even then such **weapons**
were acutely vulnerable to **environmental factors**]{.mark}.55 [For
non-state groups such **complexity** has proven a significant
**barrier**]{.mark} to CBW development]{.underline}. By means of an
example, one of the best-resourced biological weapons programs, that of
Aum Shinrikyo, failed variously because the group acquired the wrong
strain, contaminated fermenters and were faced with insurmountable
production and dissemination difficulties.56 [There are of course
exceptions, such as the 2001 [anthrax]{.mark} Letter Attacks in the
US.]{.underline} However, if one accepts the conclusions of the FBI that
this sophisticated attack with aerosolised anthrax in the US postal
system was perpetrated by a US biodefence researcher, Dr Bruce Ivins,57
[it [is an **exception** that proves the rule]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[To circumvent the difficulties with aerosolisation, arguably one could
use [human-to-human **transmissible**]{.mark} biological [agents]{.mark}
as part of a suicide bioterror operation.]{.underline} There are good
reasons for concern over how crude suicide bioterrorists could employ
such a tactic. [However, the [use]{.mark} of highly contagious agents
[is]{.mark} also **[poorly predictable]{.mark}** and would have to deal
with social factors, such as the "spatial contact process among
individuals", which can spell "out the difference between large-scale
epidemics and abortive ones]{.underline}".58

The counter to this argument is the growing access to data and the
changing human geography of the life sciences. [Some 83% of European
households reportedly are [online]{.mark}, effectively allowing access
to what is a growing body of available data on CBW, including so-called
bioterrorist "[recipes" and "**blueprints**]{.mark}]{.underline}" that
are available in both mainstream scientific as well as more subversive
literatures online. It is also clear that there is a changing human
geography in European life sciences (for peaceful purposes), with the
emergence of 30 DIY-bio groups located in Europe59 and some 80 European
teams in the international Genetically Engineered Machines (IGEM)
competition in 2016.60 This is compounded by reports that groups such as
Daesh have deliberately sought to recruit foreign fighters "including
some with degrees in physics, chemistry, and computer science, who
experts believe have the ability to manufacture lethal weapons from raw
substances".61

Whilst it would be unwise to ignore such developments, [[there is a
**need** for caution in looking at the **extent** to which new
**tech**]{.mark}nologies [and geographies]{.mark} will
[facilitate]{.mark} the [adoption of **chemical** and
**bio**]{.mark}logical [weapons]{.mark} by groups seeking to target
European countries. First, [data is not **information**, and
**info**]{.mark}rmation [is not **knowledge**]{.mark}, let alone the
tacit knowledge [required for **CBW**]{.mark}.62]{.underline} In many
cases a degree of determination and dedication will be required merely
to separate online fantasy from fact and identify operationally useful
information (of relevance to the European context) from nonsense (or
information pertinent to contexts other than Europe). Second, with new
technologies there is the potential for such tools to enable some, but
certainly not all, actors, and [[even then new technologies
bring]{.mark} new [challenges. **CRISPR**]{.mark}]{.underline}, gene
editing technology is currently seen as a particular source of promise
and peril, which purportedly enables "even largely untrained people to
manipulate the very essence of life".63 As much may be technically true,
yet "untrained people" would nonetheless [[require]{.mark} some
[**guidance** in identifying **suitable** areas of genetic structures to
**manipulate**]{.mark}. Moreover, CRISPR [would only get **aspiring**
weaponeers so far]{.mark}, with the process of culturing, scaling-up and
weaponisation [still requiring considerable **attention** and
**interdisciplinary** skills]{.mark}, typically generated through "large
interdisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, and technicians",64 in
order [to be effective]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Indeed, for all the progress in science and technology, biological
weapons are still not used, in part, because of the complexity of such
weapons; and the chemical weapons that are used today are largely the
same as the chemical weapons of 100 years ago. As Robinson noted "It
remains the case today that, in the design of CBW, increasingly severe
technological constraint sets in as the mass-destruction end of the
spectrum is approached: the greater and more assured the
area-effectiveness sought for the weapon, the greater the practical
difficulties of achieving it".65

## Warming Advantage

### 1NC -- Permafrost

#### Ocean absorption solves [permafrost melt]{.underline}.

**Moseman 22** \[Andrew Moseman (MIT Climate Portal Writing Team) citing
Andrei Sokolo (Research Scientist, MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric
and Planetary Sciences), "Will climate feedback loops push us past a
"point of no return"?" 10-04-22,
https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/will-climate-feedback-loops-push-us-past-point-no-return,
njn, accessed 6-26-2025\]

The basic mechanics of climate change are familiar: Burning fossil fuels
increases the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in our
atmosphere, causing the planet to retain more heat. However, [[the
climate]{.mark} system [is **complex**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
changing the planet's temperature can also change the natural world in
ways that release still more greenhouse gases. [These are feedback
loops, or ways that global warming can accelerate itself in a vicious
cycle.]{.underline}

[[Is it possible]{.mark} these [**feedback loops** could send us
past]{.mark} a point of **[no return]{.mark}**]{.underline}---a tipping
point where humans no longer have the power to slow climate change[[?
**Not exactly**]{.mark}, says Andrei Sokolov, MIT research scientist and
an expert on climate sensitivity]{.underline}. [[Over **longer**]{.mark}
**time** [periods]{.mark}, he says, [the Earth will **balance
itself**]{.mark} out through corrective measures]{.underline}, [such as
the ocean **absorbing carbon dioxide**]{.underline} from the air. In the
short term, though, the warming effects of feedback loops may make our
planet a decidedly unpleasant place to live.

What are these climate feedback loops? [[One example is]{.mark} the
**[loss of ice]{.mark}** cover]{.underline} as higher temperatures melt
glaciers and reduce the amount of ice that forms in the Arctic each
winter. Ice reflects lots of sunlight back into space and helps to cool
the planet (the "albedo effect"), but when ice turns to darker seawater,
that effect is diminished. Another example is water vapor: higher global
temperatures make more water evaporate from oceans, lakes, and rivers,
which means more water vapor is in the atmosphere trapping heat. And
climate change already is causing more major wildfires, which release
the carbon stored in trees.

All these effects can reinforce and worsen Earth's warming trend,
Sokolov says. But none, on its own, is catastrophic. [[Ice
exists]{.mark} mostly [in]{.mark} polar [locations that **don't
get**]{.mark} much [sunshine, **dampening** that]{.mark} albedo
[effect]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fires release CO2 stored in forests, but
forests regrow and turn back into carbon "sinks" that pull the
greenhouse gas out of the air.

The most troubling feedback of all has to do with permafrost, soil that
stays perpetually frozen. Enormous amounts of carbon reside in the
permafrost of far northern places like Alaska and Siberia, in the form
of both CO2 and methane (CH4), a shorter-lived but more powerful
greenhouse gas. Researchers estimate there may be as much as 1,600
billion tons of carbon stored in this permafrost. The Arctic region is
warming faster than the planet on average, and this effect could thaw
the soil and release some or all that carbon into the atmosphere.

Such an event could significantly accelerate climate change. To
instantly release the entire cache would double the amount of carbon now
in the atmosphere, Sokolov says, causing a rise in global temperatures
of 3.5 degrees Celsius. This would blow past the world's shared goal of
limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

While that frightening-sounding outcome is possible, Sokolov says
[[most]{.mark} of the **[climate models]{.mark}** he has studied [show a
much more **gradual release** of **permafrost**]{.mark}
carbon]{.underline}. And, crucially, the same models show that the
[[**oceans** would]{.mark} be able to [**absorb** the carbon even if
**permafrost** released]{.mark} 2,000 gigatons, [**more** than the
**highest estimate**]{.mark} of what exists]{.underline}.

"In short," he says, "I don't think there is a 'point of no return.' ...
In simulations with large CO2 pulses, the atmospheric CO2 concentration
and temperature still come down, primarily due to carbon uptake by the
ocean."

### 1NC -- Black Carbon

#### Shipping and Russia make black carbon inevitable, OR treaties solve.

**McVeigh 22** \[Karen McVeigh 22 (Senior reporter, the Guardian),
4-1-2022, "'Black carbon' threat to Arctic as sea routes open up with
global heating," The Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/10/black-carbon-threat-to-arctic-as-sea-routes-open-up-with-global-heating,
njn\]

In February last year, [[a Russian]{.mark} gas
**[tanker]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Christophe de Margerie, [[made history
by **navigating** the]{.mark} icy waters of the [**northern sea**
route]{.mark} in mid-winter]{.underline}. The pioneering voyage, from
Jiangsu in China to a remote Arctic port in Siberia, was heralded as the
start of a new era [that could reshape global shipping
routes]{.underline} -- cutting travel times between Europe and Asia by
more than a third.

It has been made possible by the climate crisis. Shrinking polar ice has
allowed shipping traffic in the Arctic to rise 25% between 2013 and 2019
and the growth is expected to continue.

But Arctic shipping is not only made possible by the climate crisis, it
is adding to it too. [[**More ships** mean a rise in]{.mark} exhaust
**[fumes]{.mark}**, which is accelerating ice melt in this sensitive
region due to a complex phenomenon [involving "**black
carbon**",]{.mark}]{.underline} an air pollutant formed by the
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.

When black carbon, or soot, lands on snow and ice, it dramatically
speeds up melting. Dark snow and ice, by absorbing more energy, melts
far faster than heat-reflecting white snow, creating a vicious circle of
faster warming.

Environmentalists warn that the Arctic, which is warming four times
faster than the global average, has seen an 85% rise in black carbon
from ships between 2015 and 2019, mainly because of the increase in oil
tankers and bulk carriers.

The particles, which exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illness
in towns, are short-term but potent climate agents: they represent more
than 20% of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from ships, according to
one estimate.

We're hitting this cascading tipping point for the climate ... we need
to do something about black carbon urgently

Yet unlike other transport sectors, including road, rail and inland
waterways, where air-quality standards curb emissions, [[**no
regulations** exist for shipping]{.underline}]{.mark}. Last November,
[[the **International Maritime Organization**]{.underline}]{.mark} (IMO)
[[adopted a **resolution** on]{.mark} the use of **[cleaner
fuels]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Arctic to reduce black carbon, [[but
left it]{.mark} as a **[voluntary]{.mark}** move.]{.underline}

Last week, the IMO was once again in the spotlight. A coalition of
[[environmental groups **warned**]{.underline}]{.mark} a meeting of its
pollution, prevention and response subcommittee [that [its resolution
did **too little**]{.mark} to tackle the Arctic's climate
crisis]{.underline}. They submitted a paper calling on governments to
agree mandatory regulations to slash shipping's emissions of black
carbon in the region.

"We're hitting this cascading tipping point for the climate," said Dr
Lucy Gilliam, senior shipping policy officer of Seas at Risk. "With the
IPCC report, we are seeing again why we need to do something about black
carbon urgently."

Last Monday, scientists from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) warned it was "now or never" for action to stave off
climate breakdown. They concluded that the international community was
underperforming on climate commitments, but singled out the shipping
sector and the IMO for particular criticism.

The pollution from global shipping increased by 4.9% in 2021, according
to a report by the shipbrokers Simpson Spence Young.

"IMO member states must agree on ambitious and urgent global action to
dramatically reduce ship-source black carbon emissions this decade, in
order to mitigate the climate crisis in the Arctic," said Dr Sian Prior,
lead adviser to the Clean Arctic Alliance, a coalition of 21 non-profit
groups lobbying governments to protect Arctic wildlife and people. She
urged states and regions to do their part by acting immediately to cut
black carbon from ships.

If all shipping using heavy fuel oil in the Arctic switched to cleaner
distillate fuel, it would cut their black carbon emissions by 44%, the
Alliance said. Heavy fuel oil or bunker fuel is a viscous, low-grade,
cheap oil contaminated with substances including nitrogen and sulphur,
which make it more polluting than distillate.

If all ships also installed diesel particulate filters, which reduce
emissions by capturing and storing soot, black carbon could be cut by a
further 90%.

However, others argue that the IMO's 2021 ban on heavy fuel oils in the
Arctic -- a move aimed at reducing the risk of spillage and expected to
come into effect in 2029 -- will see a reduction in black carbon.

"The tide is swimming in the same direction already," said Paul
Blomerus, director of Clear Seas: Centre for Responsible Marine
Shipping, an independent research institute in Canada funded by industry
and government. "Many Canadian-flagged ships are moving towards
distillate fuels, ahead of the IMO ban, which will have the added effect
of reducing black carbon emissions.

"You could argue that the IMO only has a certain amount of bandwidth and
we should concentrate on decarbonisation and how to get to net zero by
2050."

He also noted [the [major role]{.mark} that **[Russia play]{.mark}**ed
[in **Arctic shipping**]{.mark}.]{.underline} "[[Whether they would
**abide** by]{.mark} the IMO's [**regulation** is **anyone's
guess**]{.mark} in the current circumstances]{.underline}," he said.

### 1NC -- Warming Impact Defense

#### Warming isn't [existential]{.underline}. The worst pathways are [unlikely]{.underline}, and [uncertainty]{.underline} is reason to [err NEG]{.underline}.

existential risk,"

\*Note: Pethokoukis' lines denoted by italics

*Pethokoukis*: Let\'s just start out by taking a brief tour through the
existential landscape and how you see it now versus when you first wrote
the book The Precipice, which I\'ve mentioned frequently in my writings.
I love that book, love to see a sequel at some point, maybe one\'s in
the works . . . but let\'s start with the existential risk, which has
dominated many people\'s thinking for the past quarter-century, which is
**[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

*My sense is, not just you, but [many [people]{.mark}]{.underline} are
somewhat less worried than they were five years ago, 10 years ago.
Perhaps they [[see]{.mark} at least the [**most extreme** outcomes
**less likely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. How do you see it?*

Ord: I would agree with that. I\'m not sure that everyone sees it that
way, but [there were [two **really**]{.mark} **big** and [**good**
pieces of **news**]{.mark} on climate that [were **rarely
reported**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the media. One of them is that
there\'s the question about how many emissions there\'ll be. We don\'t
know how much carbon humanity will emit into the atmosphere before we
get it under control, and [there are these **different** emissions
**pathways**]{.underline}, these RCP 4.5 and things like this you\'ll
have heard of. And often, when people would give a sketch of how bad
things could be, they would talk about [**[RCP 8.5]{.mark}**, which is
the **worst**]{.underline} of these pathways, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
we\'re very clearly not on that, and we\'re also, I think pretty clearly
now, not on [**[RCP 6]{.mark}**, either]{.underline}. So [[the two
**worst pathways**, we\'re]{.mark} pretty [clearly **not
on**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and so that\'s pretty good news that
[[we\'re]{.underline}]{.mark} kind of [[headed]{.mark} more
[towards]{.mark} one of [the **better
path**]{.mark}**ways**]{.underline} in terms of the emissions that
we\'ll put out there.

*What are we doing right?*

Ultimately, some of [[those]{.mark} pathways [were]{.mark} based on
**[business-as-usual]{.mark}** ideas]{.underline} that there wouldn\'t
be climate change as one of the biggest issues in the international
political sphere over decades. So ultimately, [[nations have been
**switching**]{.mark} over [to]{.mark} **renewables** and
**[low-carbon]{.mark}** forms of [power]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is
good news. They could be doing it much more of it, but it\'s still good
news. Back when we initially created these things, I think we would\'ve
been surprised and happy to find out that we were going to end up among
the better two pathways instead of the worst ones.

The other big one is that, as well as how much we\'ll admit, [there\'s
the question of **how bad** is it to have a certain amount of **carbon**
in the atmosphere?]{.underline} In particular, how much warming does it
produce? And [this is something of which there\'s been **massive
uncertainty**]{.underline}. The general idea is that we\'re trying to
predict, if we were to double the amount of carbon in the atmosphere
compared to pre-industrial times, how many degrees of warming would
there be? The best guess since the year I was born, 1979, has been three
degrees of warming, but the [uncertainty has been somewhere **between
one** and a half degrees and **four and a half**.]{.underline}

*Is that Celsius or Fahrenheit, by the way?*

This is all Celsius. [[The climate community]{.mark} has [kept]{.mark}
the same uncertainty from **1979**]{.underline} all the way up to 2020,
[and it's [a **wild level** of **uncertainty**]{.mark}:]{.underline}
Four and a half degrees of warming is three times one and a half degrees
of warming, so [the range is up to **triple** these levels
of]{.underline} degrees of [**warming** based on this amount of
carbon]{.underline}. So massive uncertainty that hadn\'t changed over
many decades.

Now they\'ve actually revised that and have actually brought in the
range of uncertainty. Now they\'re pretty sure that it\'s somewhere
between two and a half and four degrees, and this is based on better
understanding of climate feedbacks. [[This is **good news**]{.mark} if
you\'re concerned about worst-case climate change]{.underline}. It\'s
saying [[it\'s **closer** to the **central estimate**]{.mark} than we\'d
previously thought]{.underline}, whereas previously we thought that
there was a pretty high chance that it could even be higher than four
and a half degrees of warming.

[When you hear these **[targets]{.mark}** of one and a half
degrees]{.underline} of warming or two degrees of warming, they
[[sound]{.mark} quite [**precise**, but]{.mark} in reality]{.underline},
[we [were]{.mark} just **[so uncertain]{.mark}** of how much **warming**
would follow from any particular amount of emissions]{.underline} that
it was very hard to know. And that could mean that things are better
than we\'d thought, but it could also mean things could be much worse.
And [[if you are concerned about]{.underline}]{.mark} existential risks
from climate change, then those kind of [**[tail events]{.mark}** where
it\'s **much worse** than we would\'ve **thought**]{.underline} the
things would really get, and [we\'re now pretty sure that [we\'re **not
on**]{.mark} one of those **[extreme]{.mark}** emissions [**pathways**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} also [that we\'re [not]{.mark} in a world
[where]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[temp]{.mark}**erature [is]{.mark}
extremely **[sensitive]{.mark}**]{.underline} to those emissions.

### 1NC -- Pathogens Impact Defense

#### No risk of [arctic viruses]{.underline}.

**Roth 22** \[Clare Roth (Science reporter, Deutsche Welle) citing David

njn, accessed 6-27-2025\]

[Pandemic risk \"**vanishingly small**\"]{.underline}

David Pearce, an environmental microbiologist at the University of
Northumbria, said that the paper offers interesting insight into
microbial communities in remote regions like the high Arctic, but that
[[the chances of]{.mark} the noted **[spillover]{.mark}** events
[causing **pandemics** are \"**vanishingly
small**.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"I like what they\'ve done --- as a microbiologist, I find this study
very interesting,\" he told DW.

However, [[the **biological conditions** necessary]{.mark} for a virus
[to infect humans are **not**]{.mark} **well-[supported]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the **[Arctic ice]{.mark}**]{.underline}, he said, which
makes the possibility of pandemic outbreaks negligible.

Pearce primarily studies the polar ecosystem.

\"With drill water from deep subglacial lakes, I drink it without second
thought, because [[it\'s **highly unlikely**]{.mark} that
[anything]{.mark} in there has ever encountered a human body or
[is]{.mark} likely to be **[adapted]{.mark}**]{.underline} to live in
one,\" he said.

Pearce noted that it\'s possible there are fragments of DNA integrated
in genomes that get released when the water melts.

\"But [[for them to then **excise** themselves, **express**, become
**pathogenic**, jump]{.mark} over [the **species gap**, travel from the
**Arctic...**]{.mark}]{.underline}we\'re far more likely to get another
pandemic arriving from a very high-density human population that are
intimately involved and associated with animals that have similar
viruses that are actively growing up able to jump the species gap,\" he
said.

Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist and virologist at the
University of Sydney, agreed.

\"I completely agree that climate change increases the chances of
pandemics, [but it is [**nonsense** to think]{.mark} that this means
[**melting glaciers** pose a **pandemic risk**]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
he told DW. \"[[**None** of the viruses]{.mark} found in this paper
[would]{.mark} likely **[infect]{.mark}** humans, or probably even
[mammals]{.mark}]{.underline}. The vast majority are plant or fungal
viruses, which is what you would expect from any environmental sample,
anywhere.\"

He added that [the study also only showed **bits** of virus **gene
sequence** and that [there\'s **no evidence**]{.mark} that [any of these
are]{.mark} fully **[infectious viruses]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Like Pearce, Holmes said he believes pandemics are far more likely to
occur in densely populated areas.

\"[Pandemic viruses normally come from places where a **high
biodiversity**]{.underline} and density of animals [interact closely
with **humans**]{.underline},\" he said. \"Even with climate change,
[this is **unlikely** to be the **high Arctic**]{.underline}. I would be
much more worried about the tropics and subtropics.\"

### 1NC -- Toxins Impact Defense

#### No [chemical pollution]{.underline} impact.

"[[Planetary boundaries]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[are
**problematic**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Much of [[the **apocalyptic rhetoric**]{.mark} is based on the idea that
**quantifiable limits**]{.underline}, once breached, [signal the **end
of life** on this planet]{.underline}. Johan Rockström and colleagues
coined the term in 2009. [It defines]{.underline} nine biophysical
factors---land-use change, biodiversity loss, nitrogen and phosphorous
levels, freshwater use, ocean acidification, climate change, ozone
depletion, aerosol loading, and [[**chemical**
pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}---which are "**[[hard
boundaries]{.underline}]{.mark}**". The appeal of the Planetary
Boundaries hypothesis lies in its clarity and clear directives.

But like so many scientific theories, [[the **concept** of planetary
boundaries does **not emerge objectively**]{.mark} from
science]{.underline}; rather[, [it is the product of]{.mark} a number of
**[methodological]{.mark}**]{.underline}---and sometimes
prescriptive---[[decisions]{.mark} made by very human
scientists]{.underline} at a particular place and time.

Rockström clearly stated that the Planetary Boundary hypothesis was a
normative project. But [[science is **infused** with **problematic
assumptions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For one, [planetary [boundaries are
determined using the **global scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Assuredly,
one of the nine factors---climate---is global in scope. However, the
other eight [[factors **vary** at the **local**]{.mark} and regional
[scale]{.mark}. [Some]{.mark}]{.underline}, like biodiversity, [[have no
global **tipping point**]{.underline}]{.mark} at all. Despite appearing
as hard science, [[the]{.mark} Planetary [**Boundaries hypothesis**
is]{.mark} part of science and **[advocacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Climate Change Can Alter Everything

In addition to dismal investment from China and competing interests
likely to emerge during the coming decades, [**[climate
change]{.mark}**, food insecurity, and]{.underline} the return to
[geopolitics [have]{.mark} the potential to [become sources of
**discord** between **Russia** and **China**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
NIC stresses that "no country or region will be immune from the physical
effects of climate change and environmental degradation, but the impact
will vary---some regions will even see some marginal benefits in the
form of longer growing seasons" over many years. 21 [One country that
may "**marginally benefit**" is Russia,]{.underline} whose state-backed
media has claimed that global warming will induce permafrost melt in the
Arctic and Far North regions, [improving the country's land
**arability** and **fertility** through]{.underline} 2060.22 Experts are
mixed on whether climate effects on Russia will be wholly positive.
While some studies are neutral about the climate effects on future crop
yields in the RFE, another found that [wheat productivity in central
Siberia will **increase substantially** up to 2080]{.underline}.23
Furthermore, [much of Russia's vast tundra will experience **increases**
in the availability of **water**]{.underline}, including much of
Siberia, the Far North, and northwest regions, [suggesting a **greater
capacity** overall for **farming** and bearing livestock]{.underline}.24

Meanwhile, China is on track to become a major climate loser. Multiple
recent peer-reviewed studies have found that climate change and heat
waves will degrade future food crop yields in the North China
Plain---which supplies more than half of China's wheat---over the next
several decades.25 Other studies find that the North China Plain has
become drier over the past two decades and that climate change is
already destabilizing agricultural production as a pronounced water
shortage "disturbs the stability and sustainability of agricultural
production." 26 Still other academic studies suggest that China can
avert catastrophe through improved irrigation.27 Whether or not it does,
the implications are clear: China will face grave, persistent challenges
in feeding its enormous population as the climate changes. While the
future is not wholly predictable, climate science narrows the field of
possibilities and likelihoods. Generally, given current trends, [it
appears that Russia will fare **much better** than **China** amidst the
effects of climate change.]{.underline}

Sino-Russian optimists might point out here that a sharp drop in China's
food production could bring the two countries closer, arguing that a
lack of food in China would stimulate demand for Russian goods. The two
countries have already developed a positive trade relationship around
agriculture whose momentum shows no signs of decelerating. For example,
agricultural outflows from Russia to China increased by around \$6
billion, or by 30 percent, from 2021 to 2022.28 In October 2023, Russia
agreed to supply China with nearly \$26 billion worth of grain, legumes,
and oilseeds over the next 12 years as part of the BRI.29 China's main
source of food imports remains the United States, from whom China is
seeking to diversify away, portending additional growth with Russia.
Chinese authorities have also "actively responded" to opportunities for
working with the Russian government to develop northeastern China and
the RFE jointly. Russian farmers, for their part, have struggled to
overcome local labor shortages and bureaucratic obstacles to hiring
foreign workers, suggesting that Chinese migrant workers could meet
their demand.30

By these measures, both the Chinese and Russian governments will benefit
from strong relations from the present moment into the next decade or
so. Russia will maintain a healthy export-based economy; China will keep
the lights on and its large population fed. Yet, [their **symbiotic**
trade **relations** now and into the near future **belie
friction**]{.underline} in the 2030s and far beyond. [The longterm
**climate trendlines**]{.underline}, while far off, [do **not bode
well** for the bilateral **relationship**, considering the likely
**magnitude** of future **food scarcity** in China]{.underline}. While
China's population decline might relieve some pressure from decreasing
food availability, the population is not expected to fall below one
billion people before 2080.31 As the climate changes before then,
[[China's **food demand** will]{.mark} continue to [**rise** while
Russia's]{.mark} wheat **[production soars]{.mark}**]{.underline}.32

While demand in China and supply in Russia rises and the two powers
might establish an equilibrium, [this scenario would **position
Russia**, the crucial **supplier**, as the state **determining the
terms** for food trade]{.underline}. We can assume that [Beijing would
not want to **provoke** the Kremlin without good reason]{.underline};
indeed, Xi is not Kangxi. But Beijing may also not want to rely solely
on the whims of fickle Moscow's export controls to ensure that one
billion Chinese people are fed, especially if structural shifts in
Russian wheat production fail to meet high Chinese demand in the
future.33 [Beijing is much **more sensitive** to downward pressure on
**agricultural trade**]{.underline} than it is to price fluctuations on
energy. [[Overreliance on **Russian food**]{.underline}]{.mark}stuffs
[[would prove disastrous]{.mark} for a]{.underline} Chinese Communist
Party (**[CCP]{.underline}**) [looking to **avoid** a repeat of the
1959-1961 **famine**]{.underline} that killed nearly 30 million people
and the domestic unrest that would inevitably follow suit. Thus, [China
will seek]{.underline} a trade strategy that avoids overt antagonism but
seeks [to **exploit opportunities** to address its needs if Beijing
feels too much pressure]{.underline} to feed its population.

Consistent with the Chinese government's recent behavior, and in
response to the challenge, [[the **CCP** could resort to **coercion**
and]{.mark} soft-power initiatives]{.underline}.34 It [might seek
opportunities to [**expand** into Russia]{.mark} because of the
**pronounced lack** of other **solutions**]{.underline} determined to be
realistic by the CCP. [The movement of **Chinese laborers** into the RFE
has already incited [cross-border **tensions**]{.mark} for
decades]{.underline}, irking Russia.35 It [[could worsen much further in
a future]{.mark} era [marked by]{.mark} **warming climates**, vast
[increases in]{.mark} cross-border **[migration]{.mark}**, and improved
**farming**]{.underline} conditions [in Russia.]{.underline} Growing
Russian discontent with shifting power dynamics in the wake of China's
rapid economic growth has been coupled with persistent racial animosity
that led to exaggerated fears in the early 1990s of a Chinese "farm
surge" when some Chinese migrants settled in agricultural land in the
border region. Chinese traders, building on China's growth and
geographic proximity, gained substantial market share and Chinese
state-owned enterprises have substantial interests in natural resource
extraction in the region.36 In the RFE, the arrival of Chinese farmers
over many years has increased land prices while decreasing land
available for Russians and lowering shares of rented land by Russian
farmers.37

While thousands of low-wage Chinese laborers and illegal loggers have
resettled in the RFE in recent years, many are transient workers. To be
sure, the economic and population decline of the RFE has not encouraged
a vast flood of Chinese migrants so far. While numbers are imprecise,
[as of 2019 there were likely only about 70,000 [**Chinese** citizens
living in the **RFE**]{.mark}, and this population [is]{.mark} likely
**[declining]{.mark}**]{.underline}.38 [[This]{.mark} trend [is
**unlikely** to continue]{.mark}, however, [with **climate
change**]{.mark}. [Dispersing]{.mark} a far larger gathering of
**[Chinese laborers]{.mark}** across the RFE [would be met with]{.mark}
**rage**---and probably **[resistance]{.mark}**---by
Russians.]{.underline}

While under increasing climate pressure in the future, [[Beijing may
**encourage** ventures into **Russia**]{.mark}n farm
country]{.underline}, which could be seen in Chinese government policy
circles [[as]{.mark} a relatively easy solution---perhaps [the **only
solution**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[to]{.mark} food [scarcity]{.mark}.
Seeing Moscow **weakened** by persistent **economic mismanagement** and
the **demographic aftershocks** of Ukraine]{.underline}, and as unable
to defend the Far East that it barely controls now, [China could see a
**unique opportunity** for expansion to **address** its food scarcity on
its **own terms**]{.underline}. While this may seem speculative, it has
historical precedent. For example, [the Qing dynasty **ceded** over
one-million square acres of what is now [the **RFE**]{.mark} to
Russia]{.underline} in a pair of treaties in 1858 and 1860, and these
losses are entwined with the history of China's "Century of
Humiliation," [which [underpins Xi's push for]{.mark} the "**[Great
Rejuvenation]{.mark}** of the Chinese Nation."]{.underline} While
reclaiming these territories has not been central to Beijing's rhetoric,
in September 2023, [China's Global Times published a map that showed
**disputed sites** along the Sino-Russian border as part of **Chinese
territory**]{.underline}, and the Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources
has ordered the labeling of Chinese maps of the region to show
historical Chinese names.39

Despite China's claims, [even a starving China is **unlikely** to
**amass forces** for a sudden **annexation** of large swathes of Russian
territory. Doing so would invite **retaliation** that could result in a
**disastrous war** between nuclear-armed states]{.underline}. But
whatever method China uses to lay claim to significant Russian territory
could imperil relations with Moscow. For example, [Beijing might instead
opt to **capitalize** on the Kremlin's **weak** state authority to
**erode** the status quo, congruent with Chinese **gray-zone tactics**
employed elsewhere]{.underline} such as in the South China Sea. Beijing
could, for instance, orchestrate a steady, [year-by-year influx of
farmers and associated [migrant laborers]{.mark} into the]{.underline}
RFE. But even this---seizing just enough Russian farmland needed to
overcome food scarcity in future China--- [[would **rupture
relations**]{.mark} with the Kremlin [inevitably **even
without**]{.mark} descending into direct
**[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Picture an end-state in which
Chinese farming dominates a large swath of Siberia.

The Kremlin would probably not sit idle before that happens. Russian
fears of a Chinese surge have already led to restrictive visa and
permitting procedures that have limited legal migration, while
protective measures have been instituted to prioritize Russian workers
and contractors.40 Russia's economic and population trends are likely to
continue downward and the cumulative demographic impact of Russia's war
effort with Ukraine will draw resources, people, and state attention
away. As the impact of climate change mounts, the odds are that China
will seek to advance its interests increasingly and
aggressively---interests that the Kremlin will find difficult to
counteract, ignore, or reconcile with domestic priorities. Chinese
elites and speculators could, for instance, buy more land fit for
agriculture in the RFE, providing offers that they believe would be
sufficient for overcoming regulatory hurdles and racism. Chinese
migrants, driven out of Chinese agricultural regions, could seek new
opportunities to ply their skills. The Chinese government could seek to
both aid economic migrants by underwriting their attempts to secure
Russian farmland and to quietly support the movement of illegal migrants
over the border in unofficial land grabs intended to establish a new
status quo.

For Beijing, the stakes will be incredibly high, the options few.
Besides expanding into Russia, those other options are unlikely to
overcome the potential, far-reaching climate impact on Chinese
agricultural production. For example, incursions into Bhutan, where only
about 8 percent of the land is arable, are unlikely to generate
sufficient food production.41 Neither would China's successful control
of territorial claims it disputes with India, such as the Aksai Chin.
Vietnam might contain cultivable land for harvesting rice and raising
livestock in great quantities, but like China, it may also face steep
falls in food production during the next few decades because of climate
change.42 In the South China Sea, China competes with fishermen from the
Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan as fishery stocks face
collapse.43 Even seizing Taiwan, with its limited farmland, would grant
Beijing only sparse natural resources and prove inconducive for feeding
China's massive urban populations. Comparatively, Irkutsk, an expansive
Russian oblast near the Sino-Russian border, is agriculturally rich,
economically backward, and sparsely populated.44 The RFE saw a
population decline of nearly two million people between 1990 and 2010,
and Russian state programs to encourage resettlement and promote
economic growth have failed to reverse that trend.45

[If Chinese **migrant farming** in the RFE **expands**]{.underline},
then we can safely assume that [[Russian **grievances** will
**soar**]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially if the Chinese economic
downturn persists and China continues to shun investing in Russia. In
response, and [by [using **energy** and
**food**]{.mark}]{.underline}stuffs [[as bargaining chips, the Kremlin
could]{.mark} try to **[exert power]{.mark}** over Beijing]{.underline}.
We have already seen how Moscow attempted to use natural gas to coerce
Eastern European countries into submission and disrupted Ukraine's grain

the RFE becomes the world's next major breadbasket one day, [the
potential [**weaponization** of food]{.mark} resources by the Kremlin
[threatens to **undermine** Moscow's **tenuous relations** with
Beijing]{.mark} into the far future.]{.underline}

Russia's War against [[Ukraine]{.mark} has [**solidified** Russo-Chinese
ties]{.mark} while simultaneously exposing the **limits**]{.underline}
of this "comprehensive strategic partnership." Both of these trends are
visible in China's response to the war. China is giving Russia
information, diplomatic support and other assistance; it may also render
covert financial assistance going beyond expanded purchases of oil, gas
and food. Still, it is not providing large-scale economic engagements
that would place major Chinese assets at risk from Western sanctions,
nor is it providing military assistance or hardware.

[[Despite]{.mark} the current military **[restraint]{.mark}**, the last
few years have seen [**ample evidence** of increasing]{.mark} bilateral
[**military co-operation** that may]{.mark}]{.underline} well resume and
even [[expand into]{.mark} new areas such as [the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The war's outcome will probably
increase [Russia's **dependence** on China for economic and political
support]{.underline} that [may well **manifest** itself in their future
**Arctic co-operation**]{.underline}. And [that co-operation could
**easily** build upon the growing **bilateral** military
**ties**]{.underline}. Russia is the only Arctic country that permits
large-scale Chinese investment in the region, although it previously
restricted the Arctic's exposure to Chinese economic power. But as
Western firms exit from involvement with Russia, Moscow may no longer be
able to withstand Chinese pressure for an expanded Arctic presence in
accordance with China's own considerable military and non-military
Arctic ambitions.1

While long-term continuation of the current sanctions against Moscow,
even after hostilities end in Ukraine, could block Chinese investment,
any [large-scale **co-operation** in the Arctic makes it another
**theater** of]{.underline} US-China, and possibly [**NATO-China**,
confrontation]{.underline}. This possibility becomes more likely with
the impending NATO membership of Finland and Sweden, [which will make
the Baltic and the Arctic even **greater** places of confrontation
between **Russia** and NATO and could engender **adverse consequences**
for China's]{.underline} plans for a [Polar Silk Road]{.underline}.2

BILATERAL ARCTIC MILITARY CO-OPERATION

[The Russian military and energy sectors' **visible support** for ties
with China]{.underline} and Chinese military support for the partnership
with Russia [make the **rising tide** of bilateral military co-operation
particularly **worrisome**]{.underline}, not least because of its
potential future significance in the Arctic, especially due to China's
commercial and military Arctic interests. Indeed, [the Russian
military]{.underline}, undoubtedly with Vladimir Putin's support,
[**openly solicited** an alliance with China]{.underline} in 2014 and
2020.3 As Michael Yahuda has similarly observed, [Russian military
elites **strongly favor** enhanced **collaboration** with
China.]{.underline}

As shown below, elements in Russia openly advocate enhanced military and
non-military Arctic co-operation. Several analysts argue that these
relations have reached the stage of a de facto, if informal, alliance.
As a result, [[Russo-Chinese]{.mark} military [**co-operation** in the
Arctic is]{.mark} becoming [a **real threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
recent article about Sino-Russian collaboration in Afghanistan also
observes, "Beijing and Moscow, once bitter adversaries, now co-operate
on military issues, cyber security, high technology, and in outer space,
among other areas. While it falls short of an alliance, the deepening
Sino-Russian partnership confounds US strategists."4 Thus [bilateral
military **collaboration** has **clearly advanced** to]{.underline} what
Vasily Kashin, senior research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences
Institute of the Far East, calls "[an **undeclared
alliance**]{.underline}." He also observes that Moscow has advocated
this outcome since 2014 and the Crimean invasion. Indeed, in 2017,
[Moscow initiated a bilateral three-year **road map** for bilateral
**military co-operation** with China.]{.underline}

Likewise, Kashin says that China may be reluctant to call this an
alliance because it wants to preserve the idea that it does not have
formal "allies." China insists that it conducts an independent policy
and that its ties with Russia, although they involve mutual interests,
are primarily for China's benefit. Lastly, Kashin observes that the
declaration of an alliance is connected with full-fledged nuclear
co-operation to help China create a strategic launch detection system.5

In this context, the Russo-Chinese agreements of 2019 cementing the
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership include the Arctic despite some
signs of strain over that issue. Similarly, the 2022 bilateral
declaration signed by Xi Jinping and Putin reflects a unity of purpose
expressed in an ideological as well as geopolitical animus against the
US and its values that could well carry over into military activity.
Apart from winks and nods on both sides about ever closer ties, Russian
writers have published articles advocating joint Russo-Chinese air and
missile defense in the Arctic and allowing Russian ports to provide
support for Chinese ballistic missile submarines (SSBN).6 And even
though the Pentagon's 2021 report on Chinese military power said
virtually nothing about the Arctic, the revelations there about China's
nuclear programs, including weapons that will have an Arctic trajectory,
cannot but give pause to policymakers and analysts alike. Given Chinese
interest in placing submarines in the Arctic, the prospect that enhanced
bilateral military co-operation could facilitate that outcome is deeply
disquieting.

Indeed, even before the Ukraine war began in February 2022, Russia,
according to Russian analysts, had to accommodate China's Arctic
ambitions due to its dependence --- because of Western sanctions --- on
Chinese investment in the Arctic.7 [Russia is helping China to build a
missile-attack **early-warning** system]{.underline}. Thus,
[[this]{.mark} entente or **[alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, depending
on the reader's assessment, [has [already reached into]{.mark} the
**[nuclear]{.mark}** and space [domains]{.mark}]{.underline}. Worse yet,
Russian [[experts]{.underline}]{.mark} apparently [[anticipate]{.mark}
more [**joint efforts** in]{.mark} strategic [**missile defense**,
**hypersonics**, and]{.mark} nuclear-powered **submarines**
and]{.underline} we can also expect [Chinese **[arms sales]{.mark}** to
Russia]{.underline}, notably in fields like drones or shipbuilding.8 In
this context, Artyom Lukin of the Far Eastern Federal University in
Vladivostok warns:

[[A scenario in which]{.mark} China and Russia take **co-ordinated**
military **actions**]{.underline} in the Pacific and European theaters
--- for example, [[China **invades Taiwan** while Russia]{.mark}
launches a large-scale military operation in
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**no longer** looks]{.mark} purely
**[imaginary]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Northeast Asia is currently the
**most suitable** theater]{.underline} to operationalize an emerging
military alliance of Moscow and Beijing. [Russia and China have a
**direct presence** in the region, where they maintain substantial
**military potentials** that]{.underline} --- if combined --- can
[**complement** each other]{.underline}. And importantly, it is in the
North Pacific where they both directly intersect with the USA. Some
Russian analysts believe [one of the next steps in the military
collaboration could be]{.underline} forming [a **shared pool** of
support **assets**]{.underline}, such as AWACS aircraft and tanker
aircraft, [to **assist** Russian and Chinese forces operating in the
Pacific. [If the]{.mark} China-Russia military [partnership
**continues**]{.mark} its upward trend, [it will **inevitably**
affect]{.mark} the **[security]{.mark} order**]{.underline} in the
Western Pacific. [[Joint actions]{.mark} by Russia and China can
[**challenge** the system of **US**]{.mark}**-centered
[alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline} in East Asia [and alter the
**strategic balance**]{.underline} there. In future, China-Russia
patrols and other combined military missions contesting the US military
preponderance are also possible beyond East Asia, for example, in the
Atlantic, Middle East, or even the Caribbean, especially as China grows
its power projection capabilities and builds a network of overseas
military bases, such as in Djibouti and Pakistan's Gwadar.9

Finally, because this early-warning defense system includes a
space-based echelon comprising satellites that can detect
ballistic-missile launches in real time, [this nuclear **co-operation**
can also conceivably extend into **space**]{.underline}. Moreover, [this
**enhances** Chinese **defense** capabilities against a hypothetical
**disarming** first strike from the US]{.underline}, opens up
possibilities for integrating both states' early warning systems, and
thus increases the possible speed of their ability to intercept a
potential missile attack. Obviously, [**further developments** along
this line could pose **major problems** for the US and its allies in the
Arctic, Asia and Europe]{.underline}.

THE QUESTION OF AN ALLIANCE

In fact, there are good reasons, if we judge from statements by
high-ranking Russian and Chinese officials, to believe that the
Sino-Russian entente may already be an alliance in fact, if not in law
(i.e. no binding treaty). Putin has recently commented that
[Sino-Russian **[relations]{.mark}** have [reached "**unprecedented
heights**"]{.mark} based on trade and economic
co-operation]{.underline}, joint collaboration on aircraft
manufacturing, lunar scientific research, environmental protection,
cultural and people-to-people exchanges. And this does not include the
military-to-military co-operation listed here. The relations are, he
noted, evolving in "lockstep with the times," and that co-ordination in
world affairs will increase. In 2018, Putin said he did not rule out an
alliance but observed that while it is theoretically possible, it is not
necessary because their relationship is better than an alliance. In
2019, he even admitted that the scope of multi-dimensional co-operation
equated to an alliance with China. While China's posture on Ukraine
indicates the need for some revision of that stance, not much change is
needed, nor is that revision permanent. [Even though Moscow remains
**wary** about Beijing's intentions]{.underline} in the Arctic --- for
example, scuttling Chinese plans to construct a deep-water port in
Arkhangelsk --- [this entente is very much **real** and
**growing**]{.underline}. [It therefore seems quite
**unlikely**]{.underline}, as some Western analysts have argued, that
[Washington will be able to **drive wedges** between these
governments]{.underline} given the degree of Sino-Russian intimacy.

CHINA AND THE ARCTIC

Finland has revealed that in 2018 it turned down a Chinese request for
an air base in Kemijarvi, close to the North Pole. US officials more
recently have said that they see China seeking a more active role in
Arctic governance based on its claim that it is a "near-Arctic state," a
claim that Donald Trump's administration publicly denounced.
Nevertheless, China for some time has asserted its enduring aspiration,
most notably in its 2018 White Paper on the Arctic, to be a great Polar
Power. Certainly the 2018 application for an air base in Finland should
raise eyebrows concerning China's possible military interest in the
Arctic, as the Pentagon has already noted that China had deployed a
submarine in the Arctic.

Indeed, we have seen many examples of what can only be described as
suspicious Chinese activity connected to possible bases. One recent
report, from the Brookings Institution, states:

China's infrastructure investments in the Arctic sometimes appear
dual-use. Several Chinese infrastructure projects that have little
economic gain have raised concerns about strategic motivations and
dual-use capabilities. These include efforts by a former Chinese
propaganda official to purchase 250 square kilometers of Iceland to
build a golf course and airfield in an area where golf cannot be played
and later to buy 200 square kilometers of Norway's Svalbard archipelago.
Chinese companies have also sought to purchase an old naval base in
Greenland; to build three airports in Greenland; to build Scandinavia's
largest port in Sweden; to acquire (successfully) a Swedish submarine
base; to link Finland and the wider Arctic to China through rail; and to
do the same with a major port and railway in Arkhangelsk in Russia.10

More specifically, it goes on to state:

In Iceland, China later built a major Arctic station that may well be
expanded. And in Greenland, Chinese mining company General Nice Group
attempted to purchase an abandoned naval base. Fearful of potentially
jeopardizing their country's relationship with the United States, Danish
officials ultimately rejected General Nice Group's offer. Yet it has
been reported that China discreetly launched a satellite ground
receiving station in Greenland just a year later.11

Chinese representatives have also sought to buy abandoned bases and a
port in Sweden, also raising concerns regarding their ultimate
objectives.12 [Expansion of [Chinese interests]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline} and the priority of gaining unfettered access to it
also figures in China's long-term naval strategy to [[break US]{.mark}
**military [dominance]{.mark}** of the entryways into the Pacific
through **control** of the **island chains** that Chinese strategists
perceive as **blocking** China's ascension to **great-power**
status]{.underline}. So, [if China gains unhampered access to the
Arctic]{.underline}, presumably [[its **nuclear
sub**]{.mark}**marine[s]{.mark}** would **also**]{.underline} be able to
do so. [This [would alter]{.mark} the **[nuclear
balance]{.mark}**]{.underline} in relation to the US [and cast a
tremendous **shadow**]{.underline} over the entirety of Northeast Asia's
security agenda. [[China is]{.mark} also [**not shy** about
**attacking** Arctic]{.mark} states [through **cyber** and
**info**]{.mark}rmation [warfare]{.mark}, as it **already** launched
hack **attacks** against **Norway**]{.underline}'s governmental services
in 2018.13

Beyond its numerous efforts at coercive diplomacy against Arctic states
in Scandinavia, China envisions the Arctic as a "new strategic frontier"
ripe either for great-power rivalry or for extraction of valuable
resources that it hopes will not be subject to "the Malacca Dilemma" of
a potential US energy or maritime blockade of China.14 And because the
region is a new strategic frontier, [the ambition to **dominate** it and
use it for Chinese **strategic purposes** may be **driving** China's
Arctic policy]{.underline}. The Brookings Institution report again: "The
dispatch of People's Liberation Army Navy vessels to the region, the
establishment of Chinese satellite receiving stations, the deployment of
new military technologies in the region, and the possible pursuit of
Arctic access all suggest strategic motivations may guide China's
behavior."15

Moreover, China's maritime and oceanic interests are anything but
static. On the contrary, they are expanding. Authoritative military
publications, for example the 2020 Science of Military Strategy, openly
discuss naval operations in so called far seas such as the Arctic.16
These points, as well as [[the fact that]{.underline}]{.mark} many [US,
Chinese and Russian **[nuclear weapons]{.mark}**' trajectories
[**overfly** the Arctic]{.mark}, [make it]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps
[[a]{.mark} potential **[nuclear theater]{.mark}** and enhance the
importance of **strategic access**]{.underline} to the Arctic and the
Antarctic for satellite and C4ISR (command, control, computers,
communication, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) facilities
linking earth and space together.17 The Pentagon report cited above also
observed that [China's probes were **not only** directed against the
**US** but also have created anxiety among **other Arctic
states**]{.underline} concerning China's intentions.

All these developments, taken together, cannot but intensify Western
suspicions of China's ultimate Arctic goals and lead governments to
believe that they go beyond trade and scientific research to encompass a
major role in Arctic governance and greater power projection. Several
analysts --- including myself, Graham Allison and Andrea Kendall-Taylor
of the Center for a New American Security --- believe that [Sino-Russian
relations are likely to **evolve** toward Russian
**dependence**]{.underline} on China and have reached the stage of a de
facto alliance. At this point, [the **Arctic** as a **shared region**
between Moscow and Beijing becomes a **real threat**]{.underline}.18 We
need to remember here that the 2019 Russo-Chinese agreements on the
so-called Comprehensive Strategic Partnership include the Arctic even if
there are signs of strain over that issue.19 [This is **not** mere
**hypothesizing**.]{.underline}

CONCLUSIONS

Even before Russia's aggression against Ukraine, it was no longer
possible to invoke the idea of Arctic exceptionalism or see the Arctic
as a zone of peace. The current war has aggravated the situation. In
January 2022, Russia's Northern Fleet surged into Irish waters, astride
the main sea lines of communication between North America and Europe.
This was merely part of a larger exercise involving 140 combat and
supply ships from the Pacific to the North Atlantic.20 As another
assessment of these exercises commented:

A series of training maneuvers of the Northern Fleet in the Barents Sea
began in January. During the exercises, the participating forces
practiced maritime communications protection, including in crisis
situations. A few days before the war, about 20 Russian ships entered
the Barents Sea to search for foreign submarines and to establish
control over navigation in this body as well as the airspace above. It
is now possible to conclude that those activities were to prepare the
ground for potential Russian nuclear ballistic missile submarine (SSBN)
operations. During the attack on Ukraine, the Project 1144 cruiser Peter
the Great notably remained in the Barents Sea to protect the Russian
SSBNs in case NATO were to attempt to enter the conflict.21

In February, Russia issued the largest exercise warning ever given
involving Norway's part of the Barents Sea. This "notice to airmen" of
Russian missile activity in this zone stretched about 1,000km from
Kolguchev Island in the Eastern Barents Sea to Bear Gap; half of this is
inside Norway's Exclusive Economic Zone in international waters.22 Once
Putin reportedly raised the nuclear alert level, the Northern Fleet
launched a new exercise around the Kola Peninsula, the home base of its
nuclear Northern Fleet, ostensibly to "train maneuvering in stormy
conditions."23 Moreover, the cable at Svalbard operated by Space Norway
at the SvalSat Park was cut by "human activity." This cable serves more
than 100 satellite antennae and can provide all-orbit support to
operators of Polar-orbiting satellites, making it a key intelligence and
communications node. This disruption smacks of Russian sabotage
operations to blind allied intelligence and satellite communications in
the initial period of the Ukraine War.

[Since Russian surface vessels and submarines are increasingly **armed**
with **dual-capable** missiles, these threats could easily be
**replicated** in the]{.underline} North Pacific and adjacent
[**Arctic** waters]{.underline}. Rising Asian interest in the Arctic
coinciding with [[worsening]{.mark} great-power [**rivalries**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} with [[the advent of **new
tech**]{.mark}nologies [accompanied by]{.mark} mounting interest in
[nuclear **war-fighting**]{.mark}]{.underline} have already
**[[encompass]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed [[the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. All [[these]{.mark} ongoing developments
[make]{.mark} the signs of [a]{.mark} de facto [Sino-Russian
**alliance**]{.mark} increasingly **[alarming]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Conflict may break out in the South China Sea. But that no longer means
that the Arctic or other oceans near Asia's coasts or territories will
be spared. Quite the opposite.

[[The]{.mark} growing [alliance between **Russia** and
**China**]{.mark}]{.underline} is something we shouldn't lose sleep
over, their long history of mutual suspicion runs too deep -- or so we
are told. Such a view is too complacent by half. China and Russia's
mutual hostility towards the West and their opportunism also run deep.
And [[even if]{.mark} their burgeoning alliance is [a marriage of
**convenience**, it is still]{.mark} a [very **dangerous**]{.mark}
one.]{.underline}

As Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border,
the nightmare for western strategists is that Vladimir Putin's actions
are being coordinated with those of Xi Jinping in and around the Taiwan
Strait, where China's military intimidation of Taiwan has reached new
levels of intensity. Last Sunday, Taiwan reported the largest incursion
for several months by Chinese fighter jets into its air defence zone.
Western military analysts have been anxiously toggling between spy
satellites covering the two regions, convinced that at the very least
that Xi Jinping is carefully watching the West's reaction to events in
Ukraine as he calibrates his own actions towards Taiwan.

[[Moscow and Beijing have been **quick to support**]{.mark} each other's
**[strategic priorities]{.mark}**. Xi has backed Russia's demand that
Ukraine should never join Nato]{.underline}, and also Moscow's military
intervention in Kazakhstan. [Russia, long ambiguous towards Taiwan, has
now firmly stated that it regards the island as part of
China.]{.underline}

This week the [[Russian and Chinese **navies** conducted
**exercises**]{.mark} in the Arabian Sea]{.underline} -- only the latest
in a series of joint military drills that have become more frequent,
more complex and more geographically spread. [They are seeking [to
**learn** from each other]{.mark}'s tactics and procedures, helped by
the fact [Russia is a big **supplier**]{.mark} to China [of **advanced
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}, including fighter jets and missile
systems. The Russians also have a less tangible, but highly valuable
asset to pass on: the combat experience that the PLA lacks, with Russian
troops having fought in wars from Georgia and Chechnya to Ukraine and
Syria.

[The [drills]{.mark} appear to be **[go]{.mark}**ing [beyond]{.mark}
symbolic shows of **[camaraderie]{.mark}**, and are increasingly [aimed
at]{.mark} coordinating command and control and [enhancing battlefield
**interoperability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In August last year, some
13,000 troops and hundreds of aircraft, drones, artillery pieces,
antiaircraft batteries and armoured vehicles took part in a drill in
north-west China. Two months later, Chinese and Russian warships,
including destroyers, frigates, a refuelling vessel and missile-tracking
ship, sailed through the 12-mile wide Strait of Tsugaru separating
Japan's northern island of Hokkaido from its main island of Honshu. It
was part of a four-day joint exercise that was greeted with particular
alarm in Washington and Tokyo.

It is true that China does not have formal allies in the western sense.
It does not fit with Beijing's sense of its own centrality, which is
incompatible with an alliance system that might require obligations,
commitments and a degree of equity. But it [does have a hierarchy of
partnerships, of which Russia sits at the top]{.underline} -- the
relationship is designated as a 'comprehensive strategic partnership of
coordination for the new era'.

[They share a paranoia that the West is plotting to undermine them, and
increasingly define their relationship in terms of opposition to western
democracies]{.underline} -- and to the US in particular. In an annual
worldwide threat assessment, the US Director of National Intelligence
has described China and Russia as more aligned than at any point since
the mid 1950s.

'At present, certain international forces under the guise of democracy
and human rights are interfering in the internal affairs of China and
Russia,' Xi told Putin during a virtual summit between the two leaders
in December. '[China and Russia should **increase** their **joint
efforts** to more effectively **safeguard** the **security interests**
of both parties]{.underline}.' Xi addressed Putin as 'old friend', while
Putin called the Chinese leader 'esteemed friend'. No doubt that was
also for the benefit of the West, since both men know their alliance
rattles western leaders. But the showmanship makes it no less worrying.

If Russia does invade Ukraine, and strong economic sanctions are
imposed, then support from Beijing for Moscow will be vital. [[Both want
to]{.mark} see the **[end]{.mark}** of the dominance of [the
**dollar**]{.mark} in international trade and finance, [and]{.mark} such
a [crisis]{.mark} just [might help **galvanise** their
efforts]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Yes, they carry a great deal of historic baggage. After the Sino-Soviet
split in the late 1950s, the two communist giants were bitter rivals for
leadership of the world revolutionary movement. For decades they barely
spoke, and a border clash in the Russian Far East in March 1969 left
hundreds dead and brought the two sides to the brink of full-scale war.
Going back further in history, China ranks imperial Russia among the
rapacious foreign powers that imposed 'unequal treaties' on China,
grabbing huge swathes of Qing dynasty land in what is now Central Asia
and the Russian Far East. While in Moscow, China's economic advance in
areas of traditional Russian influence, such as Central Asia, does
rankle.

But [none of that is reason to dismiss their new alliance]{.underline}.
Pragmatic, opportunistic, cynical. There is a touch of all those in the
embrace of the panda and the bear -- but [[it is **foolhardy** to
**dismiss** it as something we should **not worry
about**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Even if it's only transactional, it's still [dangerous]{.underline}.

Alliances can be secret or overt, formal or informal, ambitious or
modest in their scope and aims. [An alliance is simply a combination of
states that cooperate in pursuit of shared interests. By this standard,
[Xi and Putin have an **alliance** that grows **closer every
year**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The objectives are audacious, even epic: Moscow and Beijing seek to roll
back US power and alliances so they can build sprawling spheres of
influence and create a multipolar world. They also aim to diminish the
reach of democratic values, so autocratic forms of government are secure
and even supreme.

There's no secret about this: The Sino-Russian joint statement of
February 2022 articulates the geopolitical and ideological basis of the
relationship. As for cooperation, there is plenty to be found.

Start with what [[Xi and Putin **aren't**]{.underline}]{.mark} doing:
[[**confronting** each other]{.underline}]{.mark}. The long history of
Sino-Russian hostility has been set aside, for now, so the two countries
can fight "back to back" against the liberal order. Putin can keep
fighting in Ukraine because he can leave the Russian Far East
practically undefended; China would likewise benefit from having a
secure border with Russia in any conflict with Washington.

[**[Non-aggression]{.mark}** between Russia and China [facilitates
**aggression** against]{.mark} their respective
[enemies]{.mark}]{.underline}. And the more each power disturbs the
equilibrium of Eastern Europe or the Western Pacific, the harder it is
for the US to respond decisively in either place.

Beijing and Moscow are also strengthening each other directly.
[[Military **cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- whether exercises in
geopolitical hotspots, arms sales or sharing sensitive defense
technology --- [[has **grown** beyond]{.mark} all prior
**[expectations]{.mark}** of most Western observers]{.underline}. Putin
and Xi are pushing a shared vision of autocrat-friendly internet
governance; their [diplomats collaborate to bend the world's
understanding of human rights and weaken any prospect of taking
repressive governments to task for violating them]{.underline}. In
Central Asia, [[their shared backyard]{.mark}, a combination of Russian
guns and Chinese money has [helped secure **authoritarian
rule**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Call it an **alliance** or]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Xi and Putin
prefer, [a "**[strategic partnership]{.mark}**"]{.underline} with "no
limits" and "no forbidden areas": [The [**rhetoric** is **less
important** than]{.mark} the **[realities]{.mark}** that Sino-Russian
convergence creates.]{.underline}

In the near term, [the war in [Ukraine will push **Russia** and
**China**]{.mark} even **[closer]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Economic]{.mark} and technological [integration is
**growing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, due to Russia's isolation from the
West. [Beijing and Moscow are increasing trade in yuan to reduce their
vulnerability to dollar-dominance and foreign sanctions.
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}, which isn't thrilled with Putin's bumbling
aggression but doesn't want to see him lose, [[could]{.mark} also
[provide **artillery**]{.mark} ammunition or other lethal aid to Russian
forces]{.underline} --- perhaps [[in exchange for]{.underline}]{.mark}

ideological and strategic competition. Going further back, at least as
far as the Chinese are concerned, [there is the **equally bitter**
memory of [Russia's **annexation** of Chinese land]{.mark} in the final
decades of the Qing dynasty in China.]{.underline}

[[Underpinning this]{.mark} scenario [is the]{.mark} underlying
historical [**mistrust** and **suspicion** that]{.mark} have [**always
haunted** the relationship]{.mark}]{.underline} and which, in this
scenario, comes out in full bloom. Factors such as the [[growing **power
imbalance**]{.mark} in China's favor, uncontrolled public "assertive
**[nationalism]{.mark}**" in one or both countries, or domestic
political and [social **unrest** and a stagnating]{.mark} or even
collapsed [**economy** could **resurface** and]{.mark} affect the
leaderships' calculus in both countries. This would [**exacerbate** the
underlying **tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline} or bring about new
challenges that push China and Russia toward a far more confrontational
relationship than today. For instance, Russia could decide to
fundamentally change its China policy, recalculating the cost of
becoming too dependent on China. Russia could instead begin to balance
against the more powerful China by forging an anti-Chinese coalition
with the USA and its allies in the AsiaPacific in order to protect is
interests. This as the USA simultaneously engages in rapprochement with
Russia to jointly contain China, in effect a reversal of the USChinese
approach against the Soviet Union in the 1970s. In fact, there has been
reporting that suggests that this is what President Tump is seeking to
achieve by his cosying up to Russia and more hard-nosed approach to
China, apparently following advice from Henry Kissinger.31 It is also
possible that a severe domestic legitimacy crisis in either country or
domestic leadership power struggles could spur the governments to assert
themselves more aggressively abroad in order to "mask" domestic
shortcomings or problems. Either way, the relationship would be
characterized by intense competition, which would leave bilateral
relations shaky and affect the wider geopolitical stability of Asia and
beyond.

There are two potential "hot spots" in particular where an open rivalry
could emerge and play out, either independently or in tandem. The first
regards the fate of [[the **Russian Far-East**]{.underline}]{.mark},
which [[has always been a **thorny issue**]{.mark} in Sino-Russian
relations. [Russian **anxiety** that China might]{.mark} still be
considering seeking to [regain its "lost territories" has
**never**]{.mark} completely **[disappeared]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More
likely, it has been subdued in the current climate of "best relations
ever". While the border dispute is now settled and the border regions
are stable and friendly, [[the issue]{.mark} of Russia's "land grab"
[could **resurface** due to **growing nationalism**]{.mark} in
China]{.underline}, or just because China will have gained even more of
a relative power advantage over Russia in the future and could just
simply take back its lost territories by force. In addition, the lure of
the natural resources in the Russian Far East might influence relations.
China's voracious need for oil, natural gas and agricultural products
could translate into a strong push to gain access to these resources, by
force if necessary. [China's need for natural resources could also lead
to a stronger push to gain access to the Russian Arctic]{.underline},
including the offshore resources there. Added to this[, the Russian Far
East faces a vast demographic deficit compared to the much larger
Chinese population]{.underline} on the other side of the border.32
[[One]{.mark} **plausible [effect]{.mark}** [might be **Chinese
migration** into Russia]{.mark}, probably uncontrolled, [that creates
local **resentments** with]{.mark} the [potential to
**escalate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, given the currently
underdeveloped state of the Russia Far East economically and its need
for even greater foreign assistance, notably from China, [in order to
modernize, [Chinese economic influence could create greater
**resentment** in **Moscow**]{.mark} as it fears a loss of control over
the region.]{.underline}

China, though not an Arctic state, has been an official observer on the
Arctic Council since 2013 and harbors growing Arctic ambitions. What
does the suspension of the Arctic Council --- at least for the near
future --- mean for China? The continuing conflict in Ukraine casts a
cloud over China's Arctic aspirations. Beijing may still want to have it
both ways, i.e., to continue its cooperation with Russia without
spoiling ties with other Arctic states. But with the ramifications of
the war spreading northward, China may find itself more constrained in
pursuing its Arctic interests.

Beijing knows it cannot put all its eggs in the Russian basket, and this
could be explored by the West as an opportunity to distance China from
Russia. But reducing China's dependence on Russia for advancing its
Arctic interests requires keeping China in the game in the first place.

The Polar Silk Road

The Arctic is of growing importance to China in multiple dimensions. A
key thrust is economic: namely, how [[China can leverage new
**opportunities** opened up by the **melting ice**]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}, [[especially]{.mark} those [in]{.mark}
natural-[**resource** extraction and **navigation**]{.mark}al routes, to
advance its **development interests**]{.underline}. China also has
long-standing scientific research interests and seeks to tackle the
challenges that a warming Arctic poses to China's own environment. In
addition, China has sought to strengthen its ability as a non-Arctic
state to participate in and influence Arctic governance.

Driven by the various Arctic interests, China has outlined an ambitious
Arctic strategy with its Polar Silk Road initiative and the 2018 Arctic
White Paper. But it is Russia, as rightly noted by Bobo Lo, an expert on
Sino-Russian relations, that retains a decisive say on how far Beijing's
Arctic goals can be realized --- and [[**Russia** does **not look
kindly** on those]{.mark} aspirations. The Russian Arctic counts for the
**lion's share** of Chinese investments in the region]{.underline},
especially on navigation-related infrastructure and resource extraction
projects. China's National Petroleum Corporation and state-owned Silk
Road Fund, partnered with Russia's Novatek and French firm Total, have
successfully developed a liquified natural gas megaproject on the Yamal
Peninsula. Production at Yamal started in 2017. Other projects are still
in planning or in progress. Construction is ongoing at Arctic LNG-2,
which is scheduled to launch in 2023. China's state-owned oil
corporations count for a total 20 percent stake in Arctic LNG-2, along
with Novatek, Total, and Japan Arctic LNG, a consortium of Mitsui and
the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation. China National
Chemical Engineering and the Russian firm Neftegazholding signed a
contract in 2019 to construct infrastructure at the Payakha oilfield,
with a total investment of \$5 billion over four years and an expected
launch time also in 2023.

In addition to the hydrocarbon projects, Chinese investments in the
Russian Arctic have focused on port infrastructure along the Northern
Sea Route. China signed an initial agreement with Russia in 2016 to
build a deep-sea port near Arkhangelsk on the White Sea in Russia's
northwest, which is still in the stage of planning and expected to be
used as a logistical base by China Ocean Shipping Company, Limited, for
Arctic shipping. China also expressed interest in the Belkomur railway,
which has not yet proceeded further.

Despite these Arctic project collaborations, [[Moscow views
China's]{.mark} growing **[presence]{.mark}** in the Arctic [with
**distrust**]{.mark}]{.underline}. With vast territory and a
more-than-20,000-mile coastline in the Arctic circle, [Russia has a
**strong interest** in preventing **external powers** from influencing
Arctic affairs, and]{.underline} thus [sees **China's claim** to
"near-Arctic state" status and advocacy for non-Arctic states to have a
**greater say**]{.underline} in Arctic affairs [as an **unwelcome** push
for "**internationalization**" of the region]{.underline}. Tensions
between the two nations surface at times. In 2012, for instance, Russia
blocked Chinese research vessels from conducting surveys along the
Northern Sea Route during China's fifth Arctic expedition. Up to 2013,
Moscow persistently opposed granting China observer status on the Arctic
Council. Even after the 2014 Crimea crisis, when Russia began to
demonstrate a warmer posture toward China's role in the Arctic, Moscow's
suspicions remained in place. In 2020, Russia arrested the head of the
Arctic Civic Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg on the charge of
passing classified information to China. Beijing clearly knows Russian
distrust.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Meanwhile, China has actively pursued bilateral cooperation with other
Arctic states --- especially the Nordic countries --- on Arctic
scientific research. In Sweden, China has operated the Remote Sensing
Satellite North Polar Ground Station in Kiruna, north of the Arctic
Circle, since 2016. China also signed an agreement with Finland in 2018
to establish a joint research center in Sodankyla, northern Finland, for
Arctic space observation and data-sharing services. In Karholl, northern
Iceland, the China-Iceland Arctic Science Observatory has been
operational since 2018. And on the strategic Svalbard Islands off
Norway's northwestern coast sits China's Yellow River Research Station.
Over the past decade, while pursuing its Arctic interests through
omnidirectional diplomacy, Beijing has in general managed to stay clear
of the geopolitical rivalry between Russia and the western Arctic
states, especially the NATO countries. Even shortly before the eruption
of the war in Ukraine, Chinese experts were voicing cautious optimism on
China's continued engagement with the Arctic. But the war and the latest
moves taken by the Arctic Council cast a cloud over the outlook of
China's Arctic aspirations, at least in the short run. Beijing claimed
that it would continue normal trade with Russia and refused to join
financial sanctions imposed on Russia by the West. For hydrocarbon
trade, it may get around the financial sanctions by using Chinese
renminbi. Moreover, the bifurcation between the U.S. energy sanction
(which completely bans the import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas,
and coal) and the E.U. energy sanction (which exempted the import of
Russian oil), as well as India's continued purchase of Russian
hydrocarbons, may provide room for Beijing to maneuver. But it is
unlikely the Sino-Russian hydrocarbon trade will be entirely
undisturbed. There are already reports of scaled-back Chinese imports of
Russian coal because of payment problems. A more likely scenario is that
China will be able to maintain some energy imports but at a lower level
than in the recent past. The U.S.-led restrictions on technology exports
could substantially impact Chinese investments in Russia. Under the
restrictions, companies that use American machinery, software, or
technology to manufacture their products can no longer export these
products to Russia. The sanctions may impact both the Yamal project and
the Arctic LNG-2. The Yamal project, heavily dependent on foreign
technology, may struggle to keep up its operations. The development and
launch of the Arctic LNG-2 project also faces uncertainty, as France
decided to freeze new investments in it. This project also partnered
with South Korea's Samsung Heavy Industries to build its carrier fleet,
but with Seoul joining the sanction regime, it may not have its carriers
delivered on time. While Chinese shipyards and energy firms may be
tempted to exploit this opportunity, the risk of secondary sanctions
loomed large when Washington issued a stern warning on March 8 to
Chinese companies against continuing to supply advanced technology to
Russia. Washington's warning was conveyed unequivocally at the top level
when U.S. President Joe Biden told Chinese President Xi Jinping during a
virtual meeting on March 18 that there will be "consequences" for China
should it attempt to help Russia evade sanctions. In terms of financing,
both the United States and the European Union have banned new investment
in exploration and production projects in Russia, raising the question
of whether the bans could be extended to affect subsequent Chinese
investment in Russia's energy sector. China's large state-owned banks
have quietly complied with the sanctions to avoid hurting their
international business, but financing for Sino-Russian energy joint
ventures primarily goes through China's two policy banks, Exim Bank and
China Development Bank. Beijing could set up a small bank specifically
to handle money flows between China and Russia to evade sanctions --- as
was the case of the Bank of Kunlun that China used to evade U.S.
sanctions against Iran. Meanwhile, China may see the exit of Western oil
companies (including BP, Exxon Mobil, and Shell) from Russia as creating
opportunities to make good bargains with Moscow. However, it remains
questionable how far China is willing to risk its economic ties with
Europe and the United States, especially at a time when China is
grappling with a slowing economy at home and internationally facing a
more unified West that has shown its resolve to impose significant
costs. China may see the imperative to tread with extra caution. Indeed,
China's state-owned Sinopec's decision on March 25 to suspend projects
in Russia suggests that Beijing is heeding Washington's warning despite
the foreign ministry's insistence that China has the "right to carry out
normal economic and trade exchanges" with other countries. As China's
National Petroleum Corporation and China National Offshore Oil
Corporation are reportedly also assessing the potential ramifications of
the sanctions, Beijing may watch other international investors that have
not yet decided to exit or freeze their projects in Russia, including
India's state-owned energy company Oil and Natural Gas Corp, and
Japanese investors in liquefied natural gas projects in Sakhalin and
Arctic LNG 2, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development
Co. Distancing China and Russia in the Context of the Arctic

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

The loss of the Arctic Council, at least temporarily, as a venue for
collaboration and coordination will almost certainly stifle the variety
of environmental and scientific exploration efforts that were finally
underway after the Trump administration spent years awkwardly avoiding
the term "[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}." But [it [may also
provide an **opportunity**]{.mark} for the West [to **distance** Russia
and China]{.mark}]{.underline}, while reaffirming the value of Arctic
cooperation and sustainable investment.

The concept of an "Arctic Council 2.0," reinvented to tackle the dilemma
of having the largest Arctic state being an international pariah, is
likely to gain support among non-Arctic states who have a deep interest
in Arctic governance. Under this potential new construct, decisions
would not be made by consensus, but rather by a majority of interested
states. It's possible that non-Arctic countries such as China, Japan,
South Korea, and Singapore --- which have growing Arctic interests and
have contributed much to Arctic research --- would welcome the
opportunity for them to establish a more solid role in this region's
affairs. The risks to this approach are obvious, as it would
fundamentally undermine the concept of Arctic governance being the
exclusive prerogative of Arctic states.

However, at least the United States does not see the "Arctic Council
2.0" as a serious proposal on the table for reformatting or replacing
the Arctic Council. As James P. DeHart, U.S. Coordinator for the Arctic
Region at the State Department, recently noted, "One thing that has not
changed is our commitment to the Council as the premier forum for the
Arctic region, as a circum-Polar forum."

This then leaves open the question of how the western Arctic states,
individually and collectively, will respond to the new reality in the
Arctic and how they can possibly leverage it to distance China from
Russia. The Polar Silk Road does not just run through Russia. It is a
broad effort by Beijing to invest across the Arctic and relies heavily
on European nations as target markets. This may provide the western
Arctic countries with some leverage to shape China's cost-benefit
calculation regarding its Arctic interests.

Norway, a founding NATO ally, will undoubtedly uphold the sanctions
regime and ensure solidarity with NATO and E.U. partners, but it also
needs to maintain its relations with Russia and China. Norway's role as
NATO's "listening post" on the alliance's northern flank makes Norway
most vulnerable when relations with Russia deteriorate. Its shared land
and maritime border with Russia make dialogue with Moscow essential. On
the other hand, Oslo's ties with Beijing used to be difficult following
a kerfuffle over the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 but have normalized since
2016. The two countries are striving to conclude a bilateral free-trade
agreement that could provide China with further access to European
markets and Norway's significant offshore hydrocarbon deposits that can
be developed to compensate for some of the loss of access to the Russian
Arctic. Norway is also strongly courting Chinese investment throughout
their Arctic region and it is unlikely that China would tolerate high
tensions along the western terminus of the Northern Sea Route in the
very area that links the route with the European market. Moreover,
Norway's control over the important Arctic outpost in the Svalbard
Islands gives it a unique leverage with treaty signatories Russia and
China, by providing them guaranteed access for economic and scientific
purposes. Norway's unique position vis-à-vis China and Russia could make
it a new kind of listening post for Western allies as they navigate the
new dynamics in the Arctic.

Finland and Sweden, currently non-NATO Arctic states, have begun
reconsidering their stance on the alliance. Should they join NATO,
shifting the Arctic state balance from five NATO members to seven would
send a strong signal to Moscow on the feasibility of future Arctic
cooperation as well as to Beijing on the sustainability of its
omnidirectional Arctic diplomacy. It may also embolden NATO as a new
forum for Arctic cooperation and increase non-Arctic NATO members'
interest in Arctic matters. In the long run, this may lead to a more
militaristic view of Arctic cooperation and one that bodes ill for
climate and economic cooperation. For China, having been declared a
strategic challenge for NATO, an enhanced NATO presence throughout the
Arctic would not be in its interest.

Canada has historically had hesitation about a robust role for NATO in
the North American Arctic and has long championed pan-Arctic non-defense
cooperation. It is, however, likely to remain in complete lockstep with
Washington and Europe on Russian sanctions, clearing the way for NATO to
pursue a wider role in the High North. Canada also holds out hope that
the Northwest Passage may provide a viable route for future shipping
between the Pacific and Europe, offering an alternative to the
Russia-controlled Northern Sea Route. The near-term viability of the
Northwest Passage as a safe, economical route for major shipping
activity remains in question, however, and Russia has invested much more
in the development of the Northern Sea Route, which also benefits from
uneven ice melt that frees its sea lanes much more than the Canadian
alternative. But with the second longest shoreline in the Arctic,
Canada's sea routes retain a future potential for the Polar Silk Road's
maritime trade that China cannot ignore. China has invested in Canadian
industry, especially minerals, but the investments have decreased as
U.S. warnings on so-called Chinese gray-zone activities using Arctic
investment influence have caused more scrutiny. Tensions over Canada's
arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and China's reciprocal detention
of Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig have also added
to Canadian wariness of Chinese motives. Despite this, there remains a
strong desire from Canada for foreign investment in the Arctic region
and some tribal communities do believe that Chinese investment is "too
great to pass up."

China's Arctic Outlook in the Shadow of War in Ukraine

China is likely still in the process of assessing the ramifications of
the war in Ukraine for its Arctic interests. It would be ideal for China
to continue its Arctic engagement as usual. But Russia's isolation as
well as tough sanctions have cast much uncertainty on the sustainability
of China's omnidirectional Arctic engagement. Even if a divided Arctic
becomes an inevitable reality in the near future, Beijing may live with
it and strive to walk a fine line between Russia and other Arctic
countries. Beijing knows that Russia does not want China to have a
growing role in the Arctic and that their Arctic partnership is and will
likely remain a marriage of convenience. Therefore, China may see a more
cautious approach toward its cooperation with Russia in the Arctic best
serve its own interests as it navigates through great uncertainty in the
region.

[The western [Arctic states should]{.mark}]{.underline} responsibly
[[**leverage** China's]{.mark} desire for **[increased
investment]{.mark}** and voice in the region's development [to tilt
China **away from Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if a complete
breakup of the Sino-Russian Arctic partnership is unlikely. Reducing
Europe's and China's dependence on Russian hydrocarbons will probably
present an opportunity. Washington's recent decision to supply 15
billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe this year may
mark the first step toward this goal. In the longer term, U.S. domestic
energy production needs to be increased to sustain deliveries to Europe
and probably China as well. U.S. diplomatic efforts, though bumpy and
difficult, may also yield the reopening of Venezuelan and Iranian oil
markets in the future.

no doubt that climate change will stress some regions very severely, and
that it has and will cause people to move. On the one hand, it is true
that social and economic stressors such as mass migration and tensions
over access to fresh water that might lead to or exacerbate conflicts
will increase as temperatures increase because of climate change. On the
other hand, [[communities]{.mark} could and already have [use]{.mark}d

**[stressors]{.mark}**. [International **agreements**]{.mark} can [make

[[For instance]{.mark}, water resources are going to become
**increasingly important**]{.underline} as global warming progresses.
There are hundreds of transboundary aquifers and surface freshwater
basins, as well as regions that depend on snow melt from mountains
located in other countries. But [[there are interstate
**agreements**]{.mark} on many [transboundary **water issues**]{.mark}.
Cooperation on water is much more the norm than conflict, and even

Even though India and Pakistan have clashed over other issues, and
fought two wars, [the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 between [**India** and

https://www.cfr.org/article/why-china-would-struggle-invade-taiwan, njn,
accessed 6-27-2025\]

A Treacherous Crossing

[[To invade Taiwan]{.mark}, China would have to conduct [an
**extraordinarily complex**]{.mark} military
[operation]{.mark}]{.underline}, synchronizing air, land, and sea power
as well as electronic and cyberwarfare.

[The Taiwan Strait, over ninety miles wide, is incredibly
**choppy**]{.underline}, and due to two monsoon seasons and other
extreme weather events, a seaborne [invasion is only viable a **few
months** out of the year.]{.underline}

[[Transporting]{.mark} hundreds of thousands of [soldiers]{.mark} across
the Taiwan Strait [would take **weeks** and]{.mark} require
[**thousands** of ships]{.mark}. Each crossing would take **hours**,
allowing Taiwan to **target** the ships]{.underline}, mass troops on
potential landing sites, [and erect **barriers**.]{.underline}

[China would need to **shift** military assets]{.underline} to its
eastern coast and undertake other visible preparations for an invasion,
[which Taiwan and the United States would likely be able to
**detect**.]{.underline}

Some [questions remains about whether China has the **naval vessels** it
would **need**]{.underline} to invade Taiwan successfully.
[[China's]{.mark} amphibious [fleet is **relatively
small**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and although Beijing will likely turn to
civilian ships to sustain and supplement an invading force, those take
longer to unload and would be more vulnerable to Taiwanese missiles.

Few Places to Land

Even if Chinese troops successfully cross the strait, [**few**
deep-water **ports and beaches** in Taiwan could **accommodate** a large
**landing force.**]{.underline}

Beijing would also have to assume [[Taiwan could **destroy**]{.mark} its
major **[ports]{.mark}** at a conflict's outset [to **prevent** an
**invader**]{.mark}]{.underline} from using them.

[Taiwan's west coast]{.underline} has shallow waters extending from most
of its beaches, meaning they [are **not ideal** for an invading
force.]{.underline}

[Taiwan's east coast]{.underline} is lined by cliffs that [are too steep
for an invading force to scale.]{.underline} Moving to Taiwan's major
population centers is only possible via a few narrow passes and tunnels,
which Taiwan can destroy or defend.

The D-Day operation in World War II was the largest amphibious invasion
in military history, involving seven thousand ships and almost two
hundred thousand troops who crossed the nearly one-hundred-mile English
Channel. Over a period of three-plus weeks, 850,000 troops landed on the
beaches of Normandy to liberate France. [A Chinese **amphibious
invasion** of Taiwan would likely have to **dwarf** D-Day in
scale.]{.underline}

Due to the shallow water, [[China would have to]{.mark} anchor ships
**far from Taiwan's coast** and [move equipment]{.mark}]{.underline} to
the shores [**slo[wly]{.mark}**[, making the ships
**vulnerable**]{.mark} to Taiwanese missiles and artillery.]{.underline}

[[Taiwan]{.mark} has also [invested in **defenses**, from **mines**
to]{.mark} anti-landing **spikes**, and mobile [missile
**launchers**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Despite China's rapid military **modernization**]{.underline} and its
focus on preparing for military scenarios in the Taiwan Strait, [[Taiwan
has inherent]{.mark} defensive **[advantages]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
China will find difficult to overcome.

Mountainous and Unforgiving Terrain

Even if China's military successfully established a beachhead on Taiwan,
it would struggle to navigate the mountainous terrain to secure the
island.

Taiwan's military, by contrast, has the advantage of knowing the land
and terrain and how to defend it.

Taiwan has mountain peaks reaching over twelve thousand feet. Taiwanese
troops could hide in those mountains and wage a guerrilla warfare
campaign.

[Traversing]{.underline} those [mountains to move **inland** would be
**challenging**, rendering Taiwan's east coast **far less
useful**]{.underline} and forcing invaders to focus on attacking the
island's west coast. In addition, although Taiwan has major ports
located in the south, moving to the north is also hard because there are
few major roadways and many river crossings. As a result, [a Chinese
[invasion would]{.mark} likely [have to **focus** squarely on]{.mark}
the ports and beaches located near **[Taipei]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Strategic Chokepoints

[With few viable beaches and ports to choose from and the difficulty of
moving forces]{.underline} across the island, [China's concentration
would turn to **Taiwan's capital** region]{.underline}, home to over
one-fourth of its population. [China's military would seek to **seize
control** of Taipei]{.underline} and depose Taiwan's government.

Driven by the political objective of establishing full control over
Taiwan, [China would **need to seize control** of Taiwan's capital of
**Taipei**.]{.underline}

[[However, gaining **control** of Taipei]{.mark} to establish **full
control** over Taiwan [would be **enormously
difficult**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Few routes lead into the city, which
sits in a bowl, ringed by mountains that defenders can utilize to target
an invading force.

To prevent China's military from seizing the capital, [[Taiwan
can]{.mark} choose to [**destroy** the]{.mark} city's major [**port**
and]{.mark} the tunnels and [highways]{.mark}]{.underline} leading into
the city.

Even if China's military entered Taipei, it would have to consider
conducting urban warfare.

Costly Urban Warfare

Given the island's terrain, most of Taiwan's twenty-three million people
live in a handful of cities, with seven million residing in Taipei.

To conquer Taiwan, [[China would]{.mark} therefore [be forced into
**urban combat**]{.mark}, fighting street by street.]{.underline}

[[That]{.mark} approach [would mean a]{.mark} slow, **[costly
invasion]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Taiwan has **inherent advantages** that will make an invasion
difficult, expensive, and uncertain.]{.underline} Still, the Taiwanese
people's will to fight and resist will likely prove more decisive than
mountains, ports, roads, or the ocean. If China conducts the operation
with little opposition, it can probably navigate and overcome those
obstacles. However, [[if confronted with **millions**]{.mark} **of
people** [determined to repel]{.mark} an [invasion, China will face
a]{.mark} much **[tougher task]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

All that said, [the actual [risk of]{.mark} imminent [Chinese military
action against Taiwan]{.mark} remains [**low**. Beijing **always
flexes**]{.mark} military muscle]{.underline} when highest-level U.S.
and Taiwanese officials meet face to face. Yet, though Speaker
McCarthy's visit with Taiwan's president marks the highest-level
U.S.-Taiwan meeting on US soil since 1979, China's latest response was
less militarily threatening than its reaction to last summer's visit to
Taiwan by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- and Beijing is well aware that
Washington will notice that.

More importantly, [[Xi is spending]{.mark} considerable
[energy]{.mark}]{.underline} these days [on playing a larger role on the
global stage]{.underline}, particularly [[as a **peacemaker**]{.mark}.
He]{.underline} has [offered a 12-point peace plan for
Ukraine]{.underline} he hopes will encourage others to see China as a
global mediator, even if this particular plan has no chance of success.
This past weekend, [Xi [welcomed]{.mark}]{.underline} French President
Emmanuel [[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark} and European Commission Chairman
Ursula Von der Leyen to Beijing for discussion of the Ukraine war and
the future of China's relations with Europe more broadly. Though Xi
didn't promise his European guests to lean harder on Russia, [the
Chinese and French governments issued a joint statement pledging they
would work together to bring Russian and Ukrainian negotiators to
the]{.underline} bargaining [table]{.underline}.

[This [follows]{.mark} the]{.underline} remarkable [[visit]{.mark} to
China of the foreign ministers [of]{.mark}]{.underline} Middle East
rivals [[Iran and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, where they agreed
under China's mediation to improve their historically contentious
relationship. Most importantly, just days ago[, Taiwan's former
president [Ma]{.mark} Ying-jeou became the first current or former
Taiwanese leader to [visit the mainland]{.mark}]{.underline} since
Taiwan broke away in 1949, and during his visit he spoke of the "common
inheritance of blood, language, history and culture" between the two
sides, raising hopes in Beijing that reunification can still be achieved
without risking a potentially catastrophic conflict. In short,
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [wants to be]{.underline} (at least
perceived as) **[a peacemaker]{.underline}**, and though Taiwan's future
remains of far more importance to him that any of these issues, [China's
president is **[unlikely to reverse]{.mark}**]{.underline} all these
[**[diplomatic victories]{.mark}** by stumbling into a costly
war]{.underline}.

There are more basic reasons why China is unlikely to move against
Taiwan soon. [Xi has [watched]{.mark}]{.underline} carefully
[as]{.underline} Russia's President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} has [provided a vivid demonstration
of]{.underline} just [how [**unpredictable, costly**, and
**humiliating**]{.mark} an ill-conceived [war]{.mark} can be. Taiwan,
backed with generations of]{.underline} sophisticated and powerful
[American weapons, has been preparing]{.underline} for a possible
Chinese invasion [even longer than Ukraine]{.underline} has prepped for
a full-frontal assault from Russia, and [[given]{.mark} the]{.underline}
complete [[lack of]{.mark} Chinese [combat experience]{.mark}
over]{.underline} the past [44 years, [Xi]{.mark}
[understands]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[the risks of [Pyrrhic
victory]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[or]{.underline}** even of
**[defeat]{.underline}** -- **[are real]{.underline}**. At a time [when
China is [emerging from]{.mark}]{.underline} the world's most draconian
lockdown and [its worst economic [slowdown]{.mark} in decades, Xi is
[likely to be **extra careful**]{.mark} **about the fights he
picks**]{.underline}. At least for now.

There's also the critical issue of semiconductors. About [90 percent
of]{.underline} the world's most sophisticated [computer chips are made
in Taiwan]{.underline}. Aware of the risk this creates, China, the U.S.,
and others are working as quickly as possible to lessen the risk of
economic catastrophe that would result if that production were
dramatically slowed or even halted, but self-sufficiency in chip
production is years away for every country. [China is [loath to
risk]{.mark} conflict that would leave [its economy]{.mark} without
access to the]{.underline} 21st century's [most important economic
resource]{.underline}.

One day, China may invade Taiwan, triggering a war with global
implications. But that day isn't soon. When and if it does, the [timing
will be determined by]{.underline} China's leader, not as the result of
any diplomatic provocation, but by his own calculation of [benefit and
cost]{.underline}. For now, it's still possible to hope that **[[cooler
heads]{.mark} can]{.underline}** one day **[[find a diplomatic
solution]{.underline}]{.mark}** to avert a war that would have
disastrous implications far beyond Asia.

**Nationalism and CCP motivation [won't]{.underline} motivate China to
invade [Taiwan]{.underline}.**

[In the West and parts of Asia, concern is]{.underline}
**[mounting]{.underline}** [that China might invade Taiwan to distract
from]{.underline} **[mounting domestic challenges]{.underline}** [or
because Chinese leaders imagine that their **window of opportunity** to
seize the island **is closing**.]{.underline} Facing an economic
slowdown and rising unemployment, some analysts argue, Beijing might be
tempted to launch a military offensive to rally popular support. In
January 2023, for instance, Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu,
speculated that Chinese President Xi Jinping might create an external
crisis "to divert domestic attention or to show to the Chinese that he
has accomplished something." Ot[her analysts warn of an impending war
because China's rise is slowing.]{.underline} In their view, Beijing
might try to seize the opportunity to use force against Taiwan while it
has the advantage. Admiral Mike Gilday, chief of U.S. naval operations,
suggested in October 2022 that China could try to take Taiwan as early
as 2022 or 2023. Other U.S. officials, including Mark Milley, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and William Burns, the director
of the CIA, have cautioned that Xi has not yet decided to invade Taiwan.
But there is growing concern among some Western security analysts and
policymakers that once the People's Liberation Army (PLA) believes it
has the military capability to invade Taiwan and hold the United States
at bay, Xi will order an invasion. [[Fears that China will]{.mark} soon
[invade]{.mark} Taiwan **[are]{.mark} [overblown]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[There is **little evidence**]{.underline} [that Chinese leaders see a
closing window for action]{.underline}. Such fears appear to be driven
more by Washington's assessments of its own military vulnerabilities
than by Beijing's risk-reward calculus. Historically, Chinese leaders
have not started wars to divert attention from domestic challenges, and
they continue to favor using measures short of conflict to achieve their
objectives. If anything, problems at home have moderated Chinese foreign
policy, and Chinese popular opinion has tended to reward government
bluster and displays of resolve that do not lead to open conflict. [If
Western [policymakers **exaggerate**]{.mark} **the [risk]{.mark}** of a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan, they might **inadvertently create a
self-fulfilling prophecy**]{.underline}. Instead of worrying that
Beijing will gin up a foreign crisis to bolster its standing at home or
assuming that Beijing feels pressured to invade in the near term, the
United States should focus on arresting---or at least decelerating---the
action-reaction spiral that has steadily ratcheted up tensions and made
a crisis more likely. That does not mean halting efforts to bolster
Taiwan's resilience to Chinese coercion or to diversify the United
States' defense posture in the region. But it does mean avoiding
needless confrontation and identifying reciprocal steps that Washington
and Beijing could take to lower the temperature. The hard but crucial
task for U.S. policymakers is to thread the needle between deterrence
and provocation. Symbolic displays of resolve, unconditional commitments
to defend Taiwan, and pledges of a surge in U.S. military power in the
region could stray too far toward the latter, inadvertently provoking
the very conflict U.S. policymakers seek to deter. WAG THE DOG?
[Although the logic of diversionary aggression has **an intuitive
appeal**]{.underline}, [there is little reason to think that domestic
challenges will **tempt China's leadership**]{.underline} [to launch a
war abroad.]{.underline} In a 2008 review of [[cross-national
studies]{.underline}]{.mark} of international conflict, the scholars
Matthew [Baum and]{.underline} Philip [Potter
[found]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[little]{.mark} consistent
[evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of]{.mark} world [leaders
starting]{.mark} military [hostilities to whip up]{.mark} domestic
[support]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [[authoritarian leaders]{.mark}
may be]{.underline} **[less likely]{.underline}** [than democratic ones
to]{.underline} **[initiate crises]{.underline}** in [the wake of
domestic unrest]{.underline} because [they [have]{.mark} **greater
[latitude]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to repress]{.mark} their
[people]{.mark}]{.underline}, the political scientist Chris Gelpi has
found. And [[rather than embark on]{.mark} risky [military
adventures]{.mark}]{.underline}, [leaders facing domestic
challenges]{.underline} often **[choose other means]{.underline}** [to
quell discontent, including]{.underline} **[working with other
states]{.underline}** to address threats from within---for instance, by
settling border disputes to calm unrest on their frontiers---[or
**resorting to repression**. [China's]{.mark} [response]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} once-in-a-generation protests against its [draconian
COVID]{.mark}-[19]{.mark}]{.underline} restrictions late last year
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[a [case in point]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[After demonstrators took to the streets]{.underline} in dozens of
cities carrying sheets of blank paper---symbols of resistance in the
face of censorship---[[the]{.mark} Chinese [government]{.mark} **did not
seek**]{.underline} [to deflect attention]{.underline} from domestic
discontent with aggressive foreign policy measures. Instead,
[it]{.underline} **[[eased]{.mark} its COVID-19
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [detained and interrogated
protesters]{.underline}, [and continued its post-pandemic efforts to
reassure foreign investors. [Chinese leaders have given]{.mark}
**[few]{.mark} [signs]{.mark}** that domestic [insecurity]{.mark} [might
**prompt**]{.mark} **them to [lash out]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against
Taiwan.]{.underline} On the contrary, Xi [and [the]{.mark}
[C]{.mark}]{.underline}hinese [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ommunist
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}arty leadership [have [sought to
**project**]{.mark} **an image of [confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[patience]{.underline}** [in the face of growing
international risks and challenges]{.underline}. Despite pessimism in
China about trends in public opinion that show Taiwan pulling away from
the mainland politically and culturally, Xi told the CCP's 20th Party
Congress in October 2022 that "the wheels of history are rolling on
toward China's reunification." Xi has sought to project an image of
confidence and patience. [Historically, Chinese leaders have tended
to]{.underline} **[temper their foreign policy]{.underline}** [during
times of domestic turmoil.]{.underline} Sometimes, [they have engaged in
**harsh rhetoric**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[saber
rattling]{.underline}**, [but they have **only rarely**]{.underline}
[launched military operations]{.underline} in such periods. Even
Chairman Mao Zedong, who ordered the shelling of offshore islands in
1958, sought to mobilize the Chinese population while avoiding an
outright war over Taiwan, warning that China must only fight battles it
is sure of winning. [According to]{.underline} the political scientist
M. Taylor [Fravel]{.underline}, [China has **compromised in 15 of the
17** territorial disputes]{.underline} it has settled with its neighbors
since 1949---most of them during periods of regime insecurity arising
from domestic political challenges, including unrest in Tibet and
Xinjiang in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tiananmen Square
protests in 1989, and renewed unrest in Xinjiang in the early 1990s. In
an analysis of Beijing's behavior in militarized interstate disputes
between 1949 and 1992, moreover, the political scientist Alastair Iain
[[Johnston found]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[no
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[between]{.mark} domestic [unrest
and]{.mark} [China's use of force]{.mark} externally]{.underline}." If
anything, [the [frequency]{.mark} of China's]{.underline} [involvement
in militarized]{.underline} [interstate]{.underline}
[disputes]{.underline} **[[declined when]{.mark} domestic [unrest
increased]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On the whole, in other words, [Chinese
leaders have done the]{.underline} **[opposite]{.underline}** [of what
many analysts are warning:]{.underline} [they have sought to **reduce
external tensions**]{.underline} in order to tackle domestic challenges
from a position of greater strength while attempting to deter foreign
efforts to exploit internal tensions. [Beijing's behavior in the East
and South China Seas has followed this pattern]{.underline}. During two
flare-ups with Tokyo in the 1990s over the island chain known as the
Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, for instance, Chinese leaders
quashed expressions of popular antipathy toward Japan with the aim of
preserving economic ties with Tokyo, according to the international
relations scholars Phillip Saunders and Erica Downs. And the political
scientist Andrew Chubb has shown that between 1970 and 2015, Chinese
leaders tended to be less aggressive at sea during periods of internal
strife. [When Beijing did act assertively in these maritime territorial
disputes, it did so **mainly to thwart perceived challenges** with new
capabilities, **not to distract** from heightened **domestic
insecurity**.]{.underline} BARK NOT BITE Claims that Beijing is looking
for opportunities to lash out for domestic political purposes aren't
just wrong. They are dangerous because they imply that U.S. actions have
no bearing on China's calculus on Taiwan and that the only way to deter
Beijing from diversionary aggression is to deny it the ability to
prevail in such an endeavor. [Domestic considerations and the military
balance of power are **not the only factors**]{.underline} [Xi will
weigh when deciding whether to attack Taiwan]{.underline}. Even if he
prefers to avoid a near-term conflict and believes that China's military
prospects will improve over time, he might still order a military
operation if he and other Chinese leaders perceive a sharp increase in
the risk that Taiwan could be lost. As Fravel has shown, China has often
used military force to counter perceived challenges to its sovereignty
claims in territorial and maritime disputes. Such challenges, including
U.S. actions that endorse Taiwan as an independent state or suggest that
Washington might be on the cusp of restoring a formal alliance with the
island, might trigger such a reaction from China. Even so, Beijing has
less risky ways to respond to perceived provocations, including rhetoric
and actions that could burnish its nationalist credentials without
escalating to military conflict. As I have previously argued in Foreign
Affairs, [[China's leaders]{.mark} frequently [engage]{.mark} in
[rhetorical bluster to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[appease]{.mark}**
domestic [audiences]{.mark}]{.underline} [and **minimize** the popular
**costs** of not **using military force**]{.underline}. [[They
ma]{.mark}y also [choose]{.mark} from a variety of escalatory [measures
**short of war**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to signal resolve and impose
costs]{.underline} on Taiwan, including military, economic, and
diplomatic efforts to squeeze the island and deter it from pulling away
from the mainland. Behavior of this sort should not be mistaken for
preparations for war. KEEP CALM In any society, there are people who go
looking for a fight. But [among the ranks of China's top leaders, those
people still appear to be **less influential**]{.underline} than those
who recognize that it is better to win without fighting. Although Xi
warned in 2021 that China would take "decisive measures" if provoked by
"forces for Taiwan independence," the CCP reiterated in 2022 that
"peaceful reunification" remains its "first choice." [Even the hawkish
Qiao Liang]{.underline}, a retired major general in the Chinese air
force, [has cautioned against the tide of nationalist agitation for
action against Taiwan]{.underline}. "China's ultimate goal is not the
reunification of Taiwan, but to achieve the dream of national
rejuvenation---so that all 1.4 billion Chinese can have a good life,"
Qiao said in a May 2020 interview. He went on to warn that taking Taiwan
by force would be "too costly" and should not be Beijing's top priority.

[[Based on]{.mark} many [**years** of **engagement**]{.mark} with the
**Chinese** around the Pacific both [**operationally** and
**diplomatically**]{.mark}]{.underline}, I believe [[we are **years
away** from]{.mark} any potential [**military move** by Beijing against
Taipei]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} it is particularly
[**unlikely** to happen]{.mark} in the immediate future.]{.underline}
There are several reasons.

First, [events in [Ukraine]{.mark} are **likely** to [give]{.mark}
Chinese President **[Xi]{.mark}** Jinping **[pause]{.mark}**, not
encouragement]{.underline}. He must be asking himself, "I wonder if my
generals and admirals are as bad as those Russians appear to be?" Xi was
probably assured by Putin, when they met at the Olympics in February,
that this would be a sharp, short war and that the Russians would have
full control of Ukraine before the West could get its collective boots
on. Things turned out very differently for the Kremlin.

[The [Chinese **military**]{.mark}]{.underline}, similar in many ways to
Russia's, [[lacks]{.underline}]{.mark} even the level of [**[combat
experience]{.mark}** the [Russians had]{.mark} in Afghanistan, Chechnya
and Syria]{.underline}, and in the previous invasions of Ukraine and
Georgia.

A second reason for Chinese hesitancy is [[uncertainty about the
**Taiwanese**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Would they [**fold** or
**fight**?]{.underline} [Polling is never fully **reliable**, but [all
**indications**]{.mark} are that the **[Taiwan]{.mark}**ese have a
strong **sense** of national **identity** [and are unlikely to simply
**roll over**]{.mark} when the first wave of Chinese missiles strike on
the island]{.underline}. (Beijing gave a preview of its muscle in
the exercises responding to the Pelosi visit.)

President Tsai Ing-wen is a steely leader --- she's not unlike Ukrainian
leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy --- and my assessment is that the Taiwanese
will fight, and fight hard. The geography of the island --- mountain and
forest --- is a nightmare for an invader, especially one that must mount
the assault by sea.

Third, [Beijing is watching the [**alignment** of]{.mark} the **[Western
democracies]{.mark}** across Europe]{.underline} and the Far East in
enacting ~~crippling~~ sanctions on Russia, [[causing Moscow
to **default**]{.mark} on its debt for the first time in more than a
century]{.underline}. Almost all Western corporations decamped from
Moscow, helping cause a collapse in imports, and few look to be going
back anytime soon. The NordStream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany
will have nothing but air whistling through its long tubes for the
foreseeable future, and the Europeans are making strides toward energy
independence from Moscow.

Sure, the Chinese will say to themselves, our economy is too big to
sanction, and they would be largely correct. But could the West produce
real pain-inducing sanctions on specific sectors? Absolutely. And at a
moment when the Chinese economy has been slowed by the ravages of
zero-Covid lockdowns, this prospect is particularly unappetizing.

Fourth, as the old saw goes, "all politics are local," and [[Xi has
a]{.mark} very [**delicate political** situation]{.mark} before
him]{.underline}. At the 20th Communist Party Congress late in the fall,
he will almost certainly be given a third five-year term. It is a
remarkable achievement, vaulting him into the company of Mao Zedong and
Deng Xiaoping. [He [does not want a]{.mark} major [conflict]{.mark} with
the US [to interfere with this **anointment**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} even
[after he]{.mark} fully [consolidates control]{.mark} it seems
[**unlikely** he **would**]{.mark} quickly **manufacture** a crisis that
could **[crater the global economy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Finally, [China's **military** and **political** [leaders]{.mark}
probably **assess** that they [are not]{.mark} (quite) [ready]{.mark}
for a full-scale war with the US.]{.underline} They have a [[**backlog**
of military **capability**]{.mark} they will want [to]{.mark} fully
[integrate]{.mark} into the **P**eople's **L**iberation
**A**rmy]{.underline}: a new strategic nuclear force, nuclear-powered
warships (notably aircraft carriers), hypersonic missiles, improved
offensive cyberwarfare techniques, and a far better satellite network
for reconnaissance and actual combat in space.

Although we have now suffered through three-quarters of a century
characterized by alarmism about the disasters inherent in nuclear
proliferation, [the substantive [consequences of
**prolif**]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [[have been]{.mark} quite
**[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The weapons have certainly generated
obsession, and they have greatly affected military spending, diplomatic
posturing, and ingenious theorizing. However, [the **few countries** to
which the weapons have proliferated]{.underline} have for the most part
found them a notable waste of time, money, effort, and scientific
talent. They have [quietly kept them in **storage** and have not even
found much benefit in rattling them]{.underline} from time to time.
Insofar as the weapons have been "used," it has been to stoke the
national ego and to deter real or imagined threats.

It is sometimes said, or implied, that proliferation has had little
consequence because the only countries to possess nuclear weapons have
had rational leaders. But [**[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}** have
[**proliferated** to]{.mark} large, important countries run by
unchallenged **[monsters]{.mark}**]{.underline} who, at the time they
acquired the bombs, were certifiably deranged: Josef
[Stalin]{.underline}, who in 1949 was planning to change the climate of
the Soviet Union by planting a lot of trees, [and Mao]{.underline}
Zedong, who in 1964 had just carried out a bizarre social experiment
that resulted in an artificial famine in which tens of millions of
Chinese perished.6 [[Yet **neither**]{.underline}]{.mark} country
[[used]{.mark} its nuclear weapons [for anything other than
**deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline} and ego-boosting.7

[There has never been a militarily **compelling**]{.underline} -- or
even minimally sensible -- [reason to use nuclear weapons, particularly
due to an **inability** to identify **suitable targets**]{.underline} or
ones [that could not be attacked about **as effectively** by
**conventional** munitions]{.underline}. And [it is **difficult to see**
how nuclear weapons **benefited** their possessors]{.underline} in
specific military ventures. Israel's presumed nuclear weapons did not
restrain the Arabs from attacking in 1973, nor did Britain's prevent
Argentina's seizure of the Falklands in 1982. Similarly, the tens of
thousands of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the enveloping allied
forces did not cause Saddam Hussein to order his occupying forces out of
Kuwait in 1990. Nor did possession of the bomb benefit America in Korea,
Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan; France in Algeria; or the Soviet Union in
Afghanistan.8

Proliferation alarmists may occasionally grant that countries
principally obtain a nuclear arsenal to counter real or perceived
threats, but many go on to argue that the newly nuclear country will
then use its nuclear weapons to "dominate" the area. That argument was
repeatedly used with dramatic urgency before 2003 for the dangers
supposedly posed by Saddam Hussein as discussed in Chapter 4, and it is
now being applied to Iran.

Exactly how that domination business is to be carried out is never made
clear. 9 But the notion, apparently, is that should an atomic Iraq (in
earlier fantasies) or North Korea or Iran (in present ones) rattle the
occasional rocket, other countries in the area, suitably intimidated,
would supinely bow to its demands. It seems far more likely that [[if
a]{.mark} nuclear [country **brandishes**]{.mark} its weapons [to
**intimidate**]{.mark} **others** or to get its way]{.underline}, it
will find that [[those threatened]{.mark}, rather than
**capitulating**]{.underline} to its blandishments [or rushing off to
build a **compensating arsenal**]{.underline} of their own,
[[will]{.mark} **ally** with others to **[stand up]{.mark}** to the
intimidation]{.underline} -- rather in the way they coalesced into an
alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

[It is also argued that nuclear weapons **embolden** a country to do
mischief]{.underline} with less fear of punishing consequences. However,
countries like Iran already seem about as free as they need to be to do
mischief (from the US standpoint) in the Middle East and [[rogue
states]{.underline}]{.mark} like the USSR, China, and North Korea [[do
not]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to have **[[step]{.underline}]{.mark}**ped
[[up]{.mark} their [mischief after]{.mark} gaining **[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There are conceivable situations under which nuclear weapons could serve
a deterrent function: perhaps if Iran had had them in 1980 or Kuwait had
had them in 1990, Iraq would not have invaded. However, under the
conditions in which we have actually lived, it is questionable whether
they have yet ever done so. In particular, as discussed in Chapter 1, it
is far from clear that a deterrence policy centered around nuclear
weapons is what kept the Cold War from becoming a hot one. To expect
countries that experienced World War III somehow to allow themselves to
tumble into anything resembling a repetition -- whether embellished with
nuclear weapons or not -- seems almost bizarre.

Moreover, [the [weapons have **not proved**]{.mark} to be [crucial
**status**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [or virility]{.underline} --
**[[symbols]{.underline}]{.mark}**. French President Charles de Gaulle
did opine in 1965 that "no country without an atom bomb could properly
consider itself independent," and Robert Gilpin concluded that "the
possession of nuclear weapons largely determines a nation's rank in the
hierarchy of international prestige." 10 In that tradition, some
analysts who describe themselves as "realists" have insisted for years
that Germany and Japan must soon come to their senses and quest after
nuclear weapons.11

But, as Robert Jervis has observed, "[India, China, and Israel may have
**decreased** the chance of **direct attack**]{.underline} by developing
nuclear weapons, [but it is **hard to argue** that they have increased
their general **prestige**]{.underline} or influence." 12 And, as
Jenifer Mackby and Walter Slocombe note:

Undoubtedly some countries have pursued nuclear weapons more for status
than for security. However, [**Germany**, like]{.underline} its
erstwhile Axis ally, **[Japan]{.underline}**, has [become powerful
because of]{.underline} its [**economic** might rather than its
**military**]{.underline} might, [and its **renunciation** of nuclear
weapons may even have **reinforced its prestige**]{.underline}. It has
even managed to achieve its principal international objective --
reunification -- without becoming a nuclear state.13

Pakistan and Russia may garner more attention today than they would
without nukes, but would Japan's prestige be increased if it became
nuclear? Would anybody have more or less interest in Britain or France
if their arsenals held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay much
less if they had none? Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the
world with its economic growth? Or with its Olympics?

In addition, the [**[prolif]{.mark}**eration of nuclear weapons [has
been **far slower** than]{.mark}]{.underline} has been [commonly
**[predicted]{.mark}** primarily because the weapons do not generally
convey much advantage]{.underline} to their possessor. [**Dozens** of
technologically **capable** countries have **considered** obtaining
nuclear arsenals, but **very few have**]{.underline} done so. Indeed, as
Jacques Hymans has pointed out, [even **supposedly optimistic**
forecasts about nuclear dispersion have **proved** to be **too
pessimistic**.]{.underline}14 In fact, over the decades, [[a **huge
number** of countries]{.mark} **capable** of developing nuclear weapons
have **[neglected]{.mark}** even to **consider**]{.underline} the
opportunity -- for example, Canada, Italy, and Norway -- even as
Argentina, Brazil, Libya, South Korea, and Taiwan [have backed away from
[or **reversed**]{.mark} nuclear weapons [programs]{.mark}]{.underline},
and Belarus, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine have actually
[surrendered or **dismantled** an existing **nuclear
arsenal**]{.underline}.15 Some of that reduction is no doubt due to the
hostility (and in some cases the bribery) of the nuclear nations, but
experience certainly suggests, as Stephen Meyer has shown, [[there is no
"**technological imperative**]{.mark}" for countries [to obtain
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}** once they have achieved the
technical capacity]{.underline} to do so.16

In consequence, [[**alarmist predictions** about

[defects:]{.mark}** nuclear weapons are **[dangerous]{.mark}**,
distasteful, **[costly]{.mark}**, and likely to **[rile]{.mark} the
[neighbors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, as Hymans has demonstrated,
[the weapons have [also]{.mark} been **exceedingly [difficult]{.mark}**
[to obtain]{.mark} for administratively **dysfunctional** countries like

**No risk of [authoritarianism]{.underline}.**

**Willick 23** -- Jason, Washington Post Columnist, Editorial Writer for
the Wall Street Journal and American Interest. "What if the crisis of
democracy is (mostly) in our heads?", The Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/30/democratic-more-resilient-than-expected/,
01-30-2023

In "Subjective and [**[Objective Measures]{.mark}** of Democratic
Backsliding]{.underline}," the political scientists Andrew Little of the
University of California at Berkeley and Anne Meng of the University of
Virginia [[find]{.mark} that]{.underline} the post-Cold War expansion of
democracy in nations around the world has, on average, held. "Recent
studies that find [[evi]{.mark}dence [of]{.mark} global
[backsliding]{.mark}]{.underline}," they observe, "[rely]{.underline}
heavily if not [**[entirely]{.mark}** on **[subjective]{.mark}
indicators**"]{.underline} --- such as asking experts to rate, [based on
their **own judgment**]{.underline}, the extent to which an election was
"free and fair."

[Little and Meng]{.underline} instead [measure democracy based on
**[quantifiable factors]{.mark}**]{.underline} less susceptible to
individual bias. They [[find]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example,
[**[no]{.mark} overall [decline]{.mark}** in **electoral
competition**]{.underline}. Across the world, ["The [**rate** of]{.mark}
leader]{.underline} and ruling party [[turnover]{.mark} has
remained]{.underline} fairly **[[constant]{.underline}]{.mark}** since
the late 1990s," the paper says. "[If anything, the [vote shares]{.mark}
of incumbent leaders]{.underline} in executive elections and incumbent
parties in legislatures [have **[decreased]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
recent years."

They also measured the prevalence of constraints on national leaders,
such as term limits. From 2000 to 2018, according to the paper, 60
leaders sought to evade term limits, and 34 succeeded, but the rate was
"fairly constant" over time. In an attempt to objectively measure press
freedom, the authors analyze data from the Committee to Protect
Journalists. It's a mixed picture: Murders of journalists have been
declining since 2008, but the number of journalists imprisoned has been
rising since 2000.

[The authors created their own democracy [index]{.mark}]{.underline}
reaching back to 1980, [[relying on **hard inputs**]{.underline}]{.mark}
such as the share of a population eligible to vote, [rather than
**subjective interpretation**]{.underline} by experts. "The index in
2020 [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly [as [**high** as]{.mark} it has
**[ever]{.mark} been**]{.underline}," they conclude.

Some countries, such as Hungary and Venezuela, have grown more
authoritarian, but those declines have been balanced by more-democratic
processes in other countries. When democracy scores are weighted by a
country's population, the index does show a recent downturn, but that
essentially disappears when India and China (which has hardened its
authoritarianism under Xi Jinping) are excluded.

[[Reports]{.mark} of]{.underline} a global [democratic
retreat]{.underline} might partly be [[driven by]{.mark} a [**feedback
loop** between **media** and **experts**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} Donald [Trump's]{.underline} candidacy and
[presidency prompted **greater attention** to democratic
health]{.underline} in the press, a focus that prompted experts to rate
political systems more stringently in surveys. Those surveys, in turn,
generated more media coverage.

[Another study]{.underline} out this month [helps explain the divergence
between]{.underline} democratic [perceptions and realities]{.underline}.
The author, James D. Bryan, a doctoral candidate at American University,
analyzed the World Values Survey and the European Values Survey between
2010 and 2022 to track how citizens' understanding of democracy evolved
under different political circumstances. His "[findings suggest [one's
conception]{.mark}]{.underline} of democracy [can be a **[fluid
attitude]{.mark}** that [citizens mold to match]{.mark} their
**[partisan self-interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[[**Democratic governance** is sliding **backward**]{.mark} in the
**U.S.** and much of the **world**]{.underline}, according to a series
of recent reports.

Why it matters: [The future will be shaped by]{.underline} the [push and
pull of democratic and autocratic forces]{.underline} [within
countries]{.underline} and beyond their borders. If supporters of
democracies can\'t halt democracy\'s retreat, freedom and civil
liberties could follow.

Driving the news: President [Biden held an online Summit for
Democracy]{.underline} at the end of last week against the backdrop of
[pessimistic assessments about the health of democratic government
globally]{.underline}.

[[In]{.mark} its [2021]{.mark} report, the nonprofit **Freedom
House** concluded [the **world** is in a]{.mark} \"long **[democratic
recession]{.mark}**,\" with democracy [**improving** in]{.mark} only [28
countries while **worsening in 73**]{.mark} --- the biggest **gap of the
past 15 year**s.]{.underline}

[A recent report from the **European think tank** International **IDEA**
found the [**number** of \"**backsliding democracies**\"]{.mark} had
[doubled]{.mark} over the past decade [and]{.mark} the number of
[countries **moving** in an authoritarian direction]{.mark} since 2020
**[outnumbered]{.mark}** those going in a **[democratic
direction]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[Data from the Swedish nonprofit V-Dem that was **analyzed** by the New
York Times found th[e **U.S.** and **its allies** were responsible
for]{.mark} an outsized share of **global democratic
[backsliding]{.mark}** over the past decade]{.underline}.

Between the lines: [The data signals that for all [the]{.mark}
legitimate [concerns about the rise of]{.mark} clearly
[autocratic]{.mark} [countries]{.mark} like **Russia** and **China**,
when it comes to **democratic decline**, [the alarm is coming from
**inside the house**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Biden\'s democracy summit included plenty of steadfast democracies, but
also leaders like India\'s Narendra Modi and Brazil\'s Jair Bolsonaro
who preside over countries that have [[experienced a steep democratic
decline]{.underline}](https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/74/8c/748c68ad-f224-4cd7-87f9-8794add5c60f/dr_2021_updated.pdf).

[[American democracy is]{.mark} arguably **[at risk]{.mark}** as well
--- International IDEA included the U.S. on its \"backsliding
democracies\" list amidst the **[passage of state laws]{.mark}** that
[make it **harder to vote** and]{.mark} the [installation of **partisan
loyalists** in key **election posts**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The world has taken notice of democratic struggles within the U.S. --- a
recent Pew Research Center study found only 17% of people in surveyed
countries called American democracy worth emulating, and 23% said it was
never a good example.

What they\'re saying: In his opening remarks at last week\'s summit,
President Biden called democratic erosion --- which he blamed in part on
the dissatisfaction of citizens with their democratic governments ---
\"the defining challenge of our time.\"

The big picture: [Democratic [decline stems]{.mark} in part [from the
**pandemic**]{.mark}, [as governments pursue **policies** to control the
virus that]{.mark} involve **[restrict]{.mark}**ing [civil
liberties]{.mark} like **free movement** and as **citizens** become
**frustrated** that those **policies** haven\'t yet brought an **end to
COVID-19.**]{.underline}

But [[as]{.underline} [**income inequality** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[more general **feelings** of **[insecurity rise]{.mark}**, [life in an
illiberal democracy may seem preferable]{.mark} to the **complexities**
of living under a full **democracy**]{.underline}.

### Alliance Impact

#### A strong Sino-Russian alliance provokes war in [multiple theaters]{.underline}.

**Brands 25** \[Hal Brands (Professor, Johns Hopkins University School
of Advanced International Studies; Ph.D. in History), 1-9-2025, \"The
looming Eurasian menace,\" The Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/01/09/eurasia-iran-china-russia-north-korea-geopolitics/,
njn, accessed 6-23-2025\]

[Each of these countries aims to **overturn** the **existing
order**]{.underline} in key regions around the Eurasian periphery. Each
sees U.S. power and liberal values as its greatest foes. And [[what
makes the **current moment**]{.mark} so [**precarious** is that]{.mark}
these [aggressive **powers** are making **common
cause**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[China and Russia announced their "**no limits**" strategic partnership
just before Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. They mean, in Chinese President Xi Jinping's
words, to revolutionize the international system by causing "changes the
likes of which we haven't seen for 100 years." Since that invasion,
Russia and North Korea have sealed a formal military alliance; Russia
and Iran have built a stronger defense partnership in which technology,
weapons and know-how flow both ways. And since Oct. 7, 2023, Russia has
provided targeting data and other assistance to the Houthis in Yemen,
who have also acquired missiles and other means of mayhem from Tehran.
Most of these relationships aren't new, but all have grown rapidly in
the hothouse global environment created by wars in Ukraine and the
Middle East.

To be sure, there is no overarching multilateral alliance --- no
autocrats' NATO. Mistrust among the illiberal powers remains pervasive.
But [their relationships constitute a **cohering network** of ties among
states that are **determined** to **wreck Pax Americana**]{.underline}
and command some of the most valuable strategic real estate on Earth.
[Western observers **play down** the autocrats' pacts **at their
peril**]{.underline}, because [some of [history's greatest
**cataclysms** have been caused by]{.mark} dysfunctional --- yet
**[profoundly destructive]{.mark}** --- [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Nazi **[Germany]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Fascist [[**Italy** and]{.mark}
Imperial **[Japan]{.mark}**]{.underline} never could have coexisted
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the long run. But before [[World War
II]{.underline}]{.mark}, their cooperation [[delivered devastating
**multiplier effects**]{.mark} by **destabilizing** governments on
**several fronts** at once]{.underline}. During the early Cold War, a
wary alliance between Moscow and Beijing intensified the threats facing
the free world. And whether [the new **autocratic pacts**]{.underline}
are love matches or marriages of convenience, they [are having serious
**strategic effects**.]{.underline}

For one thing, [these [relationships **encourage** aggression by
**reducing**]{.mark} its **[costs]{.mark}**: A heavily sanctioned
[Russia has been able to **continue**]{.mark} its war [in
**Ukraine**]{.mark} thanks to]{.underline} the missiles, artillery
shells, drones and troops it has received from Tehran and Pyongyang, and
the economic succor it has gotten from
**[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Likewise, the [[pacts increase **the
danger of war**]{.mark} on some fronts by pacifying others: Putin can go
all-out against Ukraine because he faces no threat from
China]{.underline}, just as [[Xi can be **bolder**]{.mark} in the
Pacific [because he has a **friendly Russia**]{.mark} at his
back]{.underline}. An [[autocratic peace]{.mark} within Eurasia
[encourages **violent meddling**]{.mark}]{.underline} around its
margins.

[[Autocratic relationships]{.mark} also [**weaken** Western
pressure]{.mark} on individual regimes]{.underline}: Russia now shields
Pyongyang from sanctions, while Tehran and Moscow develop illicit trade
networks beyond U.S. reach[. These relationships **divide U.S.
attention** by creating trouble in **several places** at
once]{.underline}. Witness Washington's agonizing debates over aid for
Ukraine vs. support for Taiwan, over hammering the Houthis vs.
husbanding missiles for a war with China. Perhaps most fundamentally,
[autocratic ties are shifting the **military balance**.]{.underline}

Beijing's record-breaking buildup has long involved purchases of Russian
planes, missiles and air defenses. And [Sino-Russian defense cooperation
is only getting **deeper** and more **secretive**]{.underline} as the
two countries work together to build submarines, helicopters and other
key capabilities.

Across Eurasia, in fact, transnational production networks are emerging:
Iranian-origin drones are being built in Russian defense plants, where
North Korean workers reportedly labor. The autocratic arms trade is
burgeoning, as Russia promises to sell state-of-the-art aircraft, air
defenses and other advanced capabilities to its partners. Disruptive
military innovation is accelerating, as North Korea receives Russian
technology and know-how for its missile and satellite programs. These
countries' militaries are also learning from one another: Iran's missile
and drone attack against Israel in April looked suspiciously similar to
Russia's previous strikes against Ukraine.

If the United States once served as the arsenal of democracy, a
modern-day arsenal of autocracy is now taking shape. Russia, Iran, China
and North Korea have already managed more defense-technological
collaboration than the Axis powers of the World War II era ever did.
Even if they never come together in a full-fledged military alliance,
they could still deepen their cooperation in dangerous ways.

For example, they could collaborate on more sensitive projects:
[[**Russia** could]{.underline}]{.mark} support North Korea's rapidly
improving nuclear program or [[give **Beijing** its]{.mark} most
[advanced **submarine**]{.mark}**-quieting
[tech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}. Putin could give the Houthis
anti-ship cruise missiles to make their attacks more lethal. [[Russia
and China could]{.mark} swap insights on how to [use **nuclear
threats**]{.mark} to keep the United States from
interfering]{.underline} as they coerce or attack their neighbors ---
precisely what Putin has done in Ukraine. Or perhaps [these countries
could find more **dramatic** ways to **cooperate**]{.underline} in
crisis or conflict.

[[China and Russia are]{.mark} already [conducting]{.mark} **military
[drills]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} potential **[conflict
zones]{.mark}**]{.underline} from the Baltic Sea to the Western Pacific,
signaling that [one illiberal power won't sit on the sidelines as
Washington fights another. [Russia could **aid China** in]{.mark} a
**[future conflict]{.mark}** against the United States [by conducting
**cyberattacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} that make it harder for America to
mobilize. Or [Putin could menace Europe by posturing his forces there
while the Pentagon is preoccupied with]{.underline} a crisis in
[Asia]{.underline}. If any of this seems unlikely, just remember that
[Western observers have repeatedly been surprised]{.underline}, even
shocked, [by how far these relationships have already come.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [[closer ties among]{.mark} U.S. [adversaries **raise the
odds** that]{.mark} a **[war]{.mark}** that starts [in **one place**
will **spill into others**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recall that [[World War
II began]{.underline}]{.mark} not as a global conflict but [[as]{.mark}
a set of [regional crises that **gradually intensified**]{.mark} and
became inseparable]{.underline} --- just as the United States' Eurasian
crises are becoming sharper, and more interwoven, today.

The United States is still struggling to adapt to this situation.
Washington continues to see the world as being divided into separate
regions. This assumption is dangerously outdated.

As the Eurasian axis coheres, individual crises take on global meaning.
It might be fashionable to talk about pivoting away from Europe to focus
on China. But one reason it would be so damaging if America abandons
Ukraine, and Russia defeats it, is that this would be a victory for the
larger autocratic coalition in its showdown with the democratic world.

The United States also lacks the resources for this new round of
rivalry. [[The **U.S. military** is designed to defeat]{.mark} only [a
**single enemy**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a major conflict. U.S. military
spending is nearly as low, as a percentage of gross domestic product, as
it has been at any time since World War II. Its defense industrial base
is in pitiful shape. Yet [as **hot wars rage** in the Middle East and
Europe, and a Sino-American cold war intensifies in the Asia-Pacific,
[the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[could easily face conflicts in **two or more** regions
**simultaneously**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- or find itself fighting a
rival that is receiving help from other adversaries.

### Rogue States Impact

#### Alliance between China and Russia emboldens [Iran]{.underline} and [North Korea]{.underline}\-\--goes [nuclear]{.underline}.

**Bosco 24** \[Joseph Bosco (China country director for the secretary of
Defense from 2005 to 2006; Asia-Pacific director of humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief from 2009 to 2010), 10-15-2024, \"Today's
Axis of Evil is bigger and more dangerous than ever,\" The Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4932788-russia-china-north-korea-axis-of-evil/,
njn, accessed 6-23-2025\]

Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently expressed mild but
potentially consequential confusion regarding the nature and scope of
America's proclaimed enemies.

His most recent article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs states:
"A small number of countries --- principally Russia, with the
partnership of Iran and North Korea, as well as China --- are determined
to alter the foundational principles of the international
system....While these countries are not an axis, and the administration
has been clear that it does not seek bloc confrontation, choices these
revisionist powers are making mean we need to act decisively to prevent
that outcome."

But when Blinken was asked to address the volatile situation in the
Middle East during his press conference in Laos last week, he said,
"Unfortunately, what we have is, among other things, a so-called axis of
resistance led by Iran that looks to create other fronts in different
places."

The "different places" he was referring to are [Gaza, the West Bank,
Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, the Red Sea and Israel]{.underline} itself. They
are [all locations where **Iran** and its proxies]{.underline} ---
Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis --- [are **wreaking
havoc**]{.underline}.

[But [the axis of **latent hostility** toward]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
active subversion of, [[the **U.S.**]{.underline}]{.mark}-[led
international order extends far beyond the Middle East]{.underline} and
[[involves]{.mark} dangerous parties more powerful than
**[Iran]{.mark}** and]{.underline} its proxies --- that is, those
[[**nuclear-armed** states]{.underline}]{.mark} mentioned in Blinken's
article: [[**Russia**, **China** and **North
Korea.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Congressional leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,
House Speaker Mike Johnson and former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer
are not reluctant to revive George W. Bush's original "axis of evil"
label and expand it beyond Iran, Iraq, North Korea "and their terrorist
allies" to include the two most critical partners and sponsors, Russia
and China.

Hamas leaders, when they unleashed their long-prepared October 7
massacre, were surely aware that it was Vladimir Putin's birthday. While
carrying out their murderous rampage against innocent Israelis,
Americans and others, they were delivering a gift to Putin.

The devastating attack on Israel served as a welcome diversion for the
Russian leader. He was struggling to cope with Ukraine's valiant
resistance --- with limited Western aid --- to Russia's second invasion
of the country since its 2014 seizure of Eastern Ukraine and Crimea
during the Obama-Biden administration.

Conversely, Hamas's atrocity was deeply unwelcome for the Biden-Harris
administration, whose attention was focused on threading a geopolitical
needle: helping Ukraine survive without provoking Putin into further
escalation, all the while keeping a wary eye on China's increasingly
aggressive posture toward Taiwan and North Korea's continued menacing of
South Korea.

Last week, on the anniversary of October 7, North Korean dictator Kim
Jong Un extended his own birthday greetings to Putin, his "closest
comrade," as Moscow and Pyongyang deepened the strategic relationship
affirmed during their June summit.

Simultaneously, on this tragic date, reports emanated from South Korea
and Ukraine that North Korean soldiers, probably military engineers, had
been killed there, the first instance of a third country sending
uniformed military personnel to participate directly in Putin's
invasion. North Korea had already been supplying Russia with massive
quantities of ammunition shells, missiles and other material used to
strike Ukraine. In return, Moscow has given Pyongyang vitally needed
technical assistance, as well as diplomatic and economic support, by
blocking further United Nations sanctions.

Kim openly declared that he is joining China and Russia in a common
struggle against "western hegemony and imperialism," an unsurprising
development given that North Korea is already dependent on China for
economic, diplomatic and security support. Pyongyang's declaration
places it squarely in tandem with the "no-limits strategic partnership"
that Putin and Xi Jinping proclaimed in February 2022, just before
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when they jointly pledged their opposition
to "certain states" that pursue "hegemony" and "unilateral military
advantage." China voiced its support for Russia's position on Ukraine,
and Putin reciprocated by endorsing Beijing's hostile intentions toward
Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific.

Although Iran is certainly at the evil center of the destructive events
in the Middle East, it is also doing its part to support Russia's
aggression with military drones to kill Ukrainians and destroy Ukraine's
cites and vital infrastructure.

All these lethal interactions and collaborative efforts are
operationalizing the mutual diplomatic and ideological declarations of a
joint anti-U.S., anti-Western strategy.

[[The]{.mark} Russia-China-Iran-North Korea **[axis]{.mark}** of
hostility [can **fairly** be called the **early**]{.mark}, limited phase
[of **World War III**]{.mark}]{.underline}, fear of which has seriously
restrained the Biden-Harris policy on Ukraine and the Middle East, just
as it paralyzed the Obama administration regarding Russian moves in
Ukraine and Syria and rationalized Donald Trump's indulgence of Putin
and Xi. Trump shudders about **[[nuclear
Armageddon]{.underline}]{.mark}** as much as President Biden does,
without understanding that [[accommodating]{.mark} the
**[dictators]{.mark}** only [makes]{.mark} a [**fatal miscalculation**
more likely]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Beijing is **betting**]{.mark} that [the West's **exaggerated
fear**]{.mark} of the Apocalypse [will]{.mark} similarly [**hold back**
a]{.mark} vigorous **[U.S. response]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- whether
under Biden, Trump or Kamala Harris --- [[to an attack on **Taiwan** or
the **Philippines**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [**North [Korea]{.mark}**
[recklessly believes the **same**]{.mark} **U.S.
[dread]{.mark}**]{.underline} of global escalation in so many "other
fronts in different places" [[will serve its]{.mark} own regional
[**ambitions** against **South Korea** and
**Japan**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pyongyang and its totalitarian
accomplices hope [America will be [pulled in **competing directions**
and **unable to cope** with the **multiplicity** of]{.mark} security
**[challenges]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Although Blinken says the administration "does not seek bloc
confrontation," U.S. policymakers may have to rely on the Cold War
prospect of mutually assured destruction to deter rash actions by
members of the malevolent authoritarian axis.

### Tech Impact

#### Continuing the Sino-Russian [partnership]{.underline} will [flip]{.underline} the military [tech balance]{.underline} in Asia.

**Michta 24** \[Chels Michta (Fellow, Democratic Resilience Program,
Center for European Policy Analysis; Ph.D. in International Relations),

European Policy Analysis,

njn, accessed 6-23-2025\]

Since the end of World War II, the United States has excelled at
building and maintaining stable security relationships, with NATO being
the prime example.

In contrast, America's adversaries have been largely unable to forge
enduring and effective great power partnerships --- the [turbulent
relationship between the **Soviet Union** and the **People's Republic of
China** during the Cold War]{.underline} (which sometimes descended into
armed conflict) [serves as a powerful reminder that a shared ideology
can often divide more than unite]{.underline}.

Currently, [a unity of purpose between the autocratic powers has created
the **closest relationship in decades**]{.underline}. China and Russia
are forging [a partnership increasingly reminiscent of a **great power
alliance**]{.underline}.

The war in [[Ukraine has brought out a core]{.mark} strategic
[realignment]{.mark} in the global power distribution [that
is]{.mark}]{.underline} fast [[redefining the world order: the
**Sino-Russian partnership**]{.underline}]{.mark} that many thought only
a few years back would not be possible [is a **new geopolitical
reality**]{.underline}.

In short, [[we may be entering a period in which the US will be
confronted by **two adversaries** determined to **upend** the global
order]{.underline}]{.mark} built by Washington and its democratic allies
in Europe and Asia.

The key variable is just how strong and enduring this Sino-Soviet
partnership will be in great power competition, and how it shapes the
power distribution in the Atlantic and the Pacific, as well as
alignments across an increasingly developed developing world.

[[As the **Kremlin** pushes to remake Europe's great power
relationships]{.mark} at a continental level, [**Beijing** is
pursuing]{.mark} a far more ambitious project aimed at changing the
**foundations** of the global order, [ending]{.mark}]{.underline} once
and for all [the era of]{.underline} worldwide **[[Western
dominion]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The two states are allies]{.underline} not because they share any
particular cultural or ideological affinity; rather, they have come
together [on account of]{.underline} the old adage that [[the "**enemy
of my enemy is my friend**]{.mark}."]{.underline} Their [partnership is
largely practical]{.underline} --- anchored in hard power principles
bereft of ideological pretense or posturing. In this realpolitik
alignment, [both parties believe they have **more to gain** from
continuing to work together than they risk losing]{.underline}.

[[Their economic relationship deepened after the West imposed
**sanctions** on Russia in the wake of its]{.underline}]{.mark} 2022
all-out [[invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. Initially, [trade
between Russia and China collapsed, but]{.underline} it [recovered
quickly, reaching new heights by the end of that year]{.underline}
---trade turnover totaled \$190bn in 2022, beating the previous record
of \$147bn set in 2021.

By December 2023, Sino-Russian trade had crashed through the \$200bn
barrier to reach \$240.1bn overall --- a 26.3% increase over the
previous year, and exceeding the annual targets set by the two
governments.

The boom has largely served Chinese interests, with Russia increasingly
in a subordinate position, exporting raw materials to China while China
sends finished goods, especially cars, to Russia --- the latter at the
expense of Russia's indigenous auto industry. China's IT sector has also
expanded into Russia, with Chinese firms recruiting cyber specialists
from Russia and buying up Russian AI startups.

[[Russia's growing dependence on China]{.underline}]{.mark} has serious
implications for Moscow's economic future, but more importantly, it
[[poses a **security threat** to the US and its allies]{.mark} in
Asia]{.underline}. I am not talking about the risks posed by increased
military cooperation, though the Chinese and Russian navies have
conducted a number of joint exercises and patrols in the Sea of Japan,
the Taiwan Strait, and even the South China Sea.

Rather, [as Moscow becomes increasingly dependent on [Beijin]{.mark}g,
the latter [will be able to demand access to key areas of **military
technology**]{.mark}]{.underline} that the Russians have developed since
the end of the Cold War, leveraging their post-Soviet designs and
benefiting from access to mainly European technology.

This is [[particularly true of Russian development in **hypersonics**
and **nuclear propulsion**]{.mark} technology]{.underline},
[areas]{.underline} where it has worked steadily to close the gap with
the West and [where China continues to lag]{.underline}.

[[It should]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[be of **serious concern**
to the US]{.mark} and its allies that the Russian and Chinese militaries
have]{.underline} set up a series of consultations and, on the margins
of the December 2023 meeting between Xi Jinping and Russian Prime
Minister Mikhail Mishustin, [pledged to improve their level of
**strategic coordination**]{.underline}. This spirit of cooperation was
on display during a recent visit to Beijing by Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov who, in addition to appearing with his Chinese counterpart, was
also received by President Xi --- a break in protocol likely intended to
underscore the new closeness of the two countries' "no limits"
partnership.

The Sino-Russia alignment is quintessentially about great power synergy
when it comes to interests and relative strength. It is fair to say that
[[without China's economic support, Russia would not have been able to
brave]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[economic
[sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}** imposed on it [[by the
West]{.underline}]{.mark} in the wake of Putin's all-out invasion of
Ukraine.

[By backing Russia, China has taken considerable risks, including the
possibility that the West]{.underline}, and the US in particular, [may
become more hostile in its economic relations]{.underline} with Beijing
if Sino-Russian cooperation deepens. (On May 1, Washington imposed
sanctions on 20 companies based in China and Hong Kong.)

And [yet [Beijing appears to have concluded that what Russia has to
offer]{.mark} China]{.underline} in military technology
[**[outweighs]{.mark}** the [economic penalties]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Should [China]{.mark}]{.underline}, "the world's factory," [[find a way
to access]{.mark} and **absorb** the [latest military
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology from Russia, [the global military
balance could **tilt decisively**]{.underline}. For the US [this i[s the
**greatest dilemma** facing]{.mark}]{.underline} its [military planners
and **[political decision-makers]{.mark}**]{.underline} alike: are we
about to witness in the military domain China's ability to leapfrog
technological and manufacturing development much as it did in the
civilian sector?

If so, [[the threat posed]{.mark} by the **P**]{.underline}eople's
**[L]{.underline}**iberation **[A]{.underline}**rmy Navy [to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates Navy in a future confrontation
over Taiwan [[would grow **exponentially**]{.mark}, requiring both new
planning]{.underline} on the Pentagon's part [and a significantly
expanded investment in the size of the US military]{.underline}.

[Tracking and correctly [assessing the extent to which the Russian and
Chinese military establishments become intertwined should]{.mark} be
among [our **top prioritie**]{.mark}**s**]{.underline}, especially as
the United States' ability to secure our allies in Asia remains
paramount.

#### That causes [nuclear war]{.underline}.

Novel Applications

How will states use such a newfound advantage? [[**Technology** rarely
fundamentally changes the **nature** or **objectives of
states**]{.underline}]{.mark}. More often, states use technology to
advance preexisting geopolitical aims. Moreover, enhanced power can
result in greater ambition. Given the geopolitical landscape described,
it is likely the United States and its Allies and partners at the core
of the international system will behave differently with new military
technologies than will revisionist powers, such as Russia and China.

[The spread of new technology to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its Allies]{.underline} and partners
[would]{.underline} likely serve, on balance, to
**[reinforce]{.underline}** the [existing sources of stability in the
prevailing international system]{.underline}. [At the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}, the United States and its Allies and partners achieved
a technological-military advantage over its great power rivals, with the
US using its unipolar position to deepen and expand a rules-based
system. They also employed their military dominance to counter perceived
threats from rogue states and terrorist networks. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, its Allies, and partners [did
not]{.underline}, however, e[ngage in military aggression
against]{.underline} great power, [**nuclear-armed** rivals]{.underline}
or their allies.

In the future, [these]{.underline} status quo [[powers are apt to use
**military advantages** to reinforce their position in the international
system and to **deter attacks** against Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and
partners in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. These states might also employ
military power to deal with threats posed by terrorist networks or by
regional revisionist powers such as Iran and North Korea. But it is
extremely difficult to imagine scenarios in which Washington or its
Allies or partners would use newfound military advantages provided by
emerging technology to conduct an armed attack against Russia or China.

Similarly, [[**Moscow** and **Beijing** would likely use any newfound
military strength to advance their **preexisting** geopolitical
aims]{.underline}]{.mark}. Given their very different positions in the
international system, however, [these states are likely to employ **new
military technologies** [in ways that are
**destabilizing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These states have made clear
their dissatisfaction with the existing international system and their
desire to revise it. Both countries have ongoing border disputes with
multiple neighboring countries.

If Moscow developed [new military technologies]{.underline} and
operational concepts that shifted the balance of power in its favor, it
[[would likely]{.underline}]{.mark} use this advantage to [[pursue
**revisionist aims**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If Moscow acquired a newfound
ability to more easily invade and occupy territory in Eastern Europe,
for example (or if Putin believed Russia had such a capability), it is
more likely Russia would be tempted to engage in aggression.

Likewise, [if **China** acquired an enhanced ability]{.underline}
through new technology [to invade and occupy **Taiwan**]{.underline} or
contested islands in the East or South China Seas, [Beijing's leaders
might also find this opportunity **tempting**]{.underline}. If new
technology enhances either power's anti-access, area-denial network,
then its leaders may be more confident in their ability to achieve a
fait accompli attack against a neighbor and then block a US-led
liberation.

[[These]{.mark} are precisely the types of [shifts in]{.mark} the
balance of **[power]{.mark}** that can **[lead to
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As mentioned previously, the predominant
scholarly theory on the causes of war---the bargaining model---maintains
that imperfect information on the balance of power and the balance of
resolve and credible commitment problems result in international
conflict.52 [**New technology** can exacerbate these causal mechanisms
by increasing **uncertainty** about]{.underline}, or causing rapid
shifts in, [the balance of power]{.underline}. Indeed as noted above,
[new military technology]{.underline} and the development of new
operational concepts [have]{.underline} shifted the balance of power and
[resulted in **military conflict** [throughout
history]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Some may argue emerging military technology is more likely to result in
a new tech arms race than in conflict. This is possible. But [Moscow and
Beijing may come to believe]{.underline} (correctly or not) [that new
tech]{.underline}nology [provides them a usable military advantage over
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its Allies and
partners. In so doing, [they may **underestimate**
Washington]{.underline}.

[[If Moscow or Beijing attacked a]{.underline}]{.mark} vulnerable **[[US
Ally]{.underline}]{.mark}** or partner in their near abroad, therefore,
[[there would be]{.mark} a risk of **major war** with the potential for
**[nuclear escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The United States has
formal treaty commitments with several frontline states as well as an
ambiguous defense obligation to Taiwan. If Russia or China were to
attack these states, it is likely, or at least possible, that [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would come to the defense of
the victims]{.underline}. While many question the wisdom or credibility
of America's global commitments, it would be difficult for the United
States to simply back down. [Abandoning a treaty ally could cause fears
that America's global commitments would unravel.]{.underline} [Any US
president]{.underline}, therefore, [would feel great pressure to come to
an Ally's defense and expel Russian or Chinese forces]{.underline}.

[Once the United States and Russia or China are at war, there would be a
risk of **nuclear escalation**]{.underline}. As noted previously,
experts assess the greatest risk of nuclear war today does not come from
a bolt-out-of-the-blue strike but from nuclear escalation in a regional,
conventional conflict.53 Russian leaders may believe it is in their
interest to use nuclear weapons early in a conflict with the United
States and NATO.54 Russia possesses a large and diverse arsenal,
including thousands of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, to support this
nuclear strategy.

In the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, [Washington indicates it could
retaliate against any Russian nuclear "de-escalation" strikes with
limited nuclear strikes of its own using **low-yield** nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.55 [The purpose]{.underline} of US strategy [is to
**deter** Russian strikes]{.underline}. [[If deterrence
fails]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[there is a **clear pathway** to
nuclear war]{.mark} between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and Russia]{.underline}. As Henry Kissinger pointed out decades ago,
there is no guarantee that, once begun, a limited nuclear war stays
limited.56

There are [similar risks of nuclear escalation in the event of a
**US-China conflict**]{.underline}. [China]{.underline} has
traditionally possessed a relaxed nuclear posture with a small "lean and
effective" deterrent and a formal "no first use" policy. But China is
relying more on its strategic forces. It [is projected to
**double**]{.underline}---if not triple or quadruple---[the size of its
nuclear arsenal in the coming decade]{.underline}.57

[Chinese experts have acknowledged there is a narrow range of
contingencies in which China might use nuclear weapons
first]{.underline}.58 As in the case of Russia, th[e US Nuclear Posture
Review recognizes the possibility of limited Chinese nuclear attacks and
also holds out the potential of a limited US reprisal with low-yield
nuclear weapons]{.underline} as a deterrent.59 [If the nuclear threshold
is breached in a conflict between the United States and China, the risk
of nuclear exchange is **real**]{.underline}.

In short, if a coming revolution in military affairs provides a real or
perceived battlefield advantage for [[Russia or
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, such a development [[raises the
likelihood]{.mark} of armed aggression against US regional allies, major
power war, and an increased risk [of **nuclear
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

AN ALTERNATIVE ORDER?

[[Global orders **magnify**]{.mark} the **[strength]{.mark}** of the
powerful states that lead them. The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, for instance, has
[**invested** in the **l**iberal **i**nternational **o**rder it helped
create because this order reflects American **preferences** and extends
**U.S. influence**]{.underline}. As long as an order remains
sufficiently beneficial to most members, a core group of states will
defend it. [Dissenting countries]{.underline}, meanwhile, [are bound by
a **collective action** problem]{.underline}. If they were to defect en
masse, they could succeed in creating an alternative order more to their
liking. But without a core cluster of powerful states around which they
can coalesce, the advantage remains with the existing order.

For decades, threats to the U.S.-led order were limited to a handful of
rogue states with little power to upend it. But
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} invasion of Ukraine and the
restructuring of interstate relations it prompted have lifted the
constraint on collective action. The [[axis]{.mark} of upheaval
represents a new **center of gravity**]{.underline}, a group that other
countries dissatisfied with the existing order can turn to. The axis
[[is **ushering**]{.mark} in [an international **system**]{.mark}
characterized [by **two orders**]{.mark} that are [becoming
increasingly]{.mark} organized and
**[competitive]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Historically, [[competing orders]{.mark} have
**[invite]{.mark}**]{.underline}d [**[conflict]{.mark}**, especially at
the **geographical seams**]{.underline} between them. [[**Wars** arise
from]{.mark} specific conditions, such as a **[territorial
dispute]{.mark}**, the need to protect **[national
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} or the interests of an ally,
[[or]{.mark} a threat to the [**survival** of a
regime]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [[the likelihood]{.mark} that any
[of]{.mark} those conditions will lead to [war **increases** in]{.mark}
the presence of **[dueling orders]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some political
science researchers have found that [periods in which a **single order**
prevailed]{.underline}---the balance-of-power system maintained by the
Concert of Europe for much of the nineteenth century, for example, or
the U.S.-dominated post--Cold War era---[were **less prone** to
**conflicts** than those characterized by **more than one** order, such
as the **multipolar** period between the **two world wars**]{.underline}
and the bipolar system of the Cold War.

[The world has gotten a **preview** of the **instability**]{.underline}
this new era of competing orders will bring, [with potential [aggressors
**empowered** by the axis's **normalization**]{.mark} of alternative
rules and less afraid of being isolated]{.underline} if they act out.
Already, [Hamas's attack on Israel threatens to **engulf** the wider
**Middle East**]{.underline} in war. Last October, [**Azerbaijan**
forcibly took control of **Nagorno-Karabakh**]{.underline}, a breakaway
region inhabited by ethnic Armenians. [Tensions flared between
**Serbia** and **Kosovo**]{.underline} in 2023, too, and [**Venezuela**
threatened to seize territory in neighboring **Guyana**]{.underline} in
December. Although internal conditions precipitated the coups in Myanmar
and across Africa's Sahel region since 2020, [the [rising]{.mark}
incidence of such [revolts is **connected** to the new]{.mark}
international **[arrangement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For many years, [it
seemed that coups were becoming **less common**]{.underline}, in large
part because plotters faced significant costs for violating norms. Now,
however, [the calculations have **changed**]{.underline}. Overthrowing a
government may still shatter relations with the West, but [the [new
regimes]{.mark} can [find **support** in **Beijing** and
**Moscow**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Further development]{.mark} of the axis would [bring]{.mark} even
**[greater tumult]{.mark}**.]{.underline} So far, [most
[collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline} among China, Iran, North Korea, and
Russia [has been **bilateral**]{.underline}. Trilateral and
quadrilateral action could expand their capacity for disruption.
Countries such as Belarus, Cuba, Eritrea, Nicaragua, and Venezuela---all
of which chafe against the U.S.-led, Western-dominated system---could
also begin working more closely with the axis. [[If the group
**grows**]{.mark} in size and tightens its coordination, [the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates and its allies [will have]{.mark}
a more [**difficult** time **defending**]{.mark} the recognized
order]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- Russia Fails (Laundry List)

#### No data sharing -- brain drain, fear of punishment, sanctions, lack of supplies

Gareth **Rees and** Ulf **Büntgen** (University of Cambridge) "Russian
dilemma for global arctic science" June 1, **2024**

Isolation of Russian arctic science from western science. [The process
of disengagement of Russian arctic]{.underline}---and other---[sciences
from much of the rest of the world has been abruptly
accelerated]{.underline} in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022, as part of the many consequences of this
tragic event (Dodds et al. 2023). Bilateral programmes towards
strengthening academic collaboration, in arctic science and elsewhere,
active as late as January 2022, were terminated almost instantly.1 The
subsequent western isolation of Russia's scholars has unfolded an
ever-growing crisis that concerns the Arctic in particular. The weeks
immediately following the military invasion were deeply confused, with
international organisations unsure how to respond. Global opinion was
and remains divided about how to respond to Russia's aggression, and a
coherent strategy towards the Arctic has become difficult to maintain.
The Arctic Council, brought into action in 1996 as a consequence of an
initiative by Mikhail Gorbachev and chaired at the time of the invasion
by Russia, was in effect paralysed, and argued by some to have died.
Russian participation in the Arctic Science Summit Week held in Tromsø
in March 2022 was non-existent, and no meeting of ISIRA took place that
year. Since that time, although chairmanship of the Arctic Council
successfully passed from Russia to Norway in May 2023, with some
resumption of activity, scientific cooperation in the Arctic has
weakened further. [Institutional-level collaboration between 'western'
countries and Russia is]{.underline} generally [not
permitted,]{.underline} and even though peer-to-peer collaboration is
usually tolerated, conditions for it are far from favourable. [Economic
sanctions imposed on Russia limit researchers' access to equipment and
consumables]{.underline}. [[The 'brain drain' has been huge, with over a
million people estimated to have left Russia since the invasion, of whom
most are highly educated]{.underline}]{.mark} (Inozemtsev 2023). Of
those [[scientists who remain]{.underline}]{.mark}, it can be presumed
that some at least [[will be afraid of being seen to work with
scientists]{.mark} in 'unfriendly' countries]{.underline} (Cornwall
2023). Likely facing similar issues, [[western scientists may also be
cautious of jeopardising the safety of their Russian
colleagues]{.underline}]{.mark}---and often friends. [[Trust and
openness are rapidly giving way to increasing suspicion and fear, at
least between Russian and western scientists]{.underline}.]{.mark}

### 1NC -- Russia Fails (Data Sharing)

#### Plan fails -- Russia won't participate or sharing meaningful data

Mia **Bennett** (journalist for Cryopolitics) "US Arctic research faces
"existential threat" February 22, **2025**

While gathered around a table at the University of Washington Arctic
research networking event, I asked one colleague originally from Russia
what they thought the US-Russia "peace" talks ongoing in Saudi Arabia
might spell for Arctic research. They noted that a resolution to the war
in Ukraine under the current circumstances would prove devastating to
freedom of speech, academia, and civil society in Russia. Trump, they
said, was completely vindicating Putin. Russian news networks now show
clips from Fox TV that exonerate the Russian war criminal. Should the
war end, his grip on domestic society will only tighten. With so many of
their young men dying on the battlefield, Russians badly need and want
the fight to have been a worthy one. [US researchers might technically
be able to return to Russia if relations are "normalized." They may even
be able to use their Visa and Mastercards during their
travels]{.underline}, because that's precisely what hundreds of
thousands of Ukrainians and Russians have died for. Priceless
sacrifices, indeed. [But]{.underline} my colleague emphasized that many
[[American universities would likely still not permit sponsored travel
to Russia, making it impossible to go]{.mark} as part of a funded and
insured work trip. While [Russian archives are open, it's not safe to
access them]{.mark} since the Kremlin has deemed any research that is
even remotely critical a danger to the state. [Russian
researchers]{.mark}]{.underline}, too[, [often fear any form of
communication with foreigners]{.mark}]{.underline}, let alone
collaboration, lest they be seen as colluding with the enemy. [[The
environment for academic freedom in Russia is
lethal]{.underline}]{.mark}. Researchers, journalists, and activists
face jail time for any misstep. Their counterparts in the US do not face
these sort of threats. Yet they are reckoning with loss of livelihood,
meaning, and public acceptance. This means that Arctic research in not
just one major Arctic state, but two, risks annihilation. The
evisceration of climate change research During the Cold War,
nationally-scaled military, security, and economic interests motivated a
great deal of research in all of the eight Arctic states, including the
US and Russia but also Canada and the Nordic countries, as an article
led by historian Ronald Doel explains. This trend seems to be rearing
its head again. The difference between science during the Cold War and
today is that [[the US and Russia are willfully ignoring and even
attacking work on climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} despite it being
one of the most pressing issues facing the region. Even the US security
establishment recognizes this fact. In 2014, the Pentagon released a
report noting that climate change posed "immediate risks" to national
security." In 2017, Trump's former defense secretary James Mattis
acknowledged in Senate testimony that climate change was real and that
it posed a threat to US overseas interests and Department of Defense
assets around the world. Under Trump 2.0, that threat has somehow simply
disappeared -- as have the people working on the bête noire of the new
administration. [In the month [since Trump has taken office, over 10
percent of the US National Science Foundation has been fired]{.mark},
including "all of its experts]{.underline}, a class of contract workers
who are specialists in niche scientific fields," according to Politico.
Making matters worse, the experts did not have to be let go. Instead,
NSF leaders decided to fire them in the interest of "fairness" given
that probationary workers were required to be made redundant. In a
sudden return of McCarthyism, NSF staff meetings are no longer recorded
out of fear of who might get a hold of the tapes. [[Entire programs are
now gone]{.underline},]{.mark} too. The entire staff at the Human
Environment and Geographic Sciences Program, which has funded research
into issues such as climate change and human-environment relations, has
been shown the door. [Millions of dollars in funding that was set to be
awarded]{.underline} by the NSF in the coming weeks to researchers who
had spent countless hours refining their proposals are now likely to
[never see the light of day]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- US/Russia Circumvention

#### Russia won't make the changes necessary to protect the environment -- they are too economically motivated. The US doesn't care either. Just because cooperation is possible doesn't mean it will be effective

**Meduza** "Breaking the ice As the U.S. and Russia tease Arctic
cooperation, climate science could offer common ground --- but neither
side seems interested" April 22, **2025** -

Accessed - 06/27/2025//KSH

Still, while the environment may be one of the areas with fewer
obstacles to cooperation, Shumanov notes that the U.S. and Russia
approach the issue in fundamentally different ways. "If you compare the
strategic documents of the U.S. and Russia --- which really shape each
country's policies and approaches --- you'll see vastly different
emphases on climate," he said. "U.S. doctrine places far greater
importance on environmental sustainability and combating climate
change." [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast, [[acknowledges
climate change]{.mark} [mostly in terms of the benefits it
brings]{.mark}:]{.underline} easier access to resources and the Northern
Sea Route. "[Environmental constraints]{.underline}," Shumanov noted,
"[are far less the focus]{.underline}." That also seems to be the case
in practice. "[Russia has permitted the use of tankers with no ice
class]{.underline} to go through the Arctic to transport oil from
Europe, from the Baltic, to Asia," Moe said. The shipments began in
2023, after sanctions left Russia cut off from the Atlantic market.
Since then, several vessels from Russia's so-called "shadow fleet" have
made the trip --- ships that are not only old but, more critically, not
ice-strengthened. "Russia maintains that they're within safety limits"
and that the tankers are "escorted by icebreakers," Moe said. But under
normal circumstances, "those ships would not have been used." Even
though they've been sailing during the most favorable part of the year,
he said, there's concern they're ["pushing the limits" and that "the
risk of an oil spill is higher than it should have been]{.underline}."
When asked how prepared Russia and the U.S. are for a real disaster in
the Arctic, Moe pointed to a binding intergovernmental agreement under
the Arctic Council framework that "draws up a picture of zones of
responsibility and also calls for international cooperation" in the
event of an oil spill. But in practice, its utility is limited under
extreme, remote conditions. "There are some preparations, there's some
infrastructure, some equipment around," Moe said, "but hardly enough to
control a big oil spill." In the same International Arctic Forum speech
in Murmansk where he effectively endorsed Trump's Greenland ambitions,
Vladimir [[Putin laid out sweeping goals for Arctic
development]{.underline}]{.mark}: more nuclear icebreakers, new ports,
and [expanded infrastructure]{.underline} along the Northern Sea Route.
Moe called it "a wish list --- not a plan." "Many of \[the projects\]
make sense," he told Meduza. "They're things that would be good for
Russia. But the problem is, exactly how is this going to be
implemented?" Russia is spending heavily to support its war against
Ukraine. The federal budget for 2025--2027 set a record for defense
expenditures --- but even that may be hard to sustain. The broader
economy is anything but stable. "We've seen similar lists of proposals
before," Moe added. "Russia has issued several Arctic documents with a
long, long list of important projects without explaining how they\'re
going to be financed." Though [[Russia's real approach to the
environment may tell a different story]{.underline}]{.mark}, Putin did
devote time to climate concerns in the same speech --- albeit only after
blaming the West for the breakdown in cooperation. He spoke of
preserving the Arctic's "unique natural environment," called for
"environmentally friendly technologies," and [[proposed a new research
center to monitor the effects of climate change --- **not to curb
them,** but to guide infrastructure planning]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
[Trump]{.mark} administration]{.underline}, meanwhile, for all its talk
about the Arctic's strategic importance, [has [slashed funding for
NOAA]{.mark}]{.underline} and other agencies with Arctic research
programs --- [and made broader cuts to climate science]{.underline}.
That research isn't just about protecting the environment; it also
provides critical information for operating in it, like sea ice
forecasts. "In the shorter term \[the cuts\] may not have such very
clear effects," Moe told Meduza. "But it's a long-term problem --- the
administration is cutting off the possibility for long-term involvement
and investments." Indeed, [[while politically the environment might be
the easiest arena for the U.S. and Russia to revive Arctic cooperation,
it's not clear that either administration actually plans to start

One of the Arctic Council\'s six Working Groups, the Arctic Monitoring
and Assessment Programme (AMAP), recently released its Arctic Climate
Change Update 2024, summarizing key trends and impacts on the Arctic
climate. Sadly, [the Arctic]{.underline} region [continues its downward
spiral in terms of climate]{.underline}. The report shows that extreme
weather events, wildfires, melting ice, and ocean acidification have
become the new normal in the Arctic. In fact, the negative developments
are speeding up. The report presents proposals for action to counteract
this development; however, **[[gaining political traction has
become]{.mark} increasingly [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}** over the
past decade. \"While [the [Arctic Council Working Groups **do not
have**]{.mark} **much [political influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[today]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is important that they carry out their
work and function as an agenda-setting body,\" says Svein Vigeland
Rottem, Researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, to HNN. \"There
will come a time after Trump and Putin.\" Enough research, more action
In recent years, many have argued that **[[there is sufficient
research]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the impacts of Arctic climate change;
[[what is]{.mark} really [needed is action]{.mark}]{.underline} by
decision-makers. Yet, [[in the current political landscape,]{.mark} the
multilateral climate [action needed in the Arctic is
**far-fetched**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After the Ukraine War, all
scientific cooperation with Russia was discontinued. The Arctic
Council\'s work was temporarily paused in March 2022. Since February
2024, the council\'s working groups have resumed official meetings in
digital format, while meetings at the diplomatic and political levels
have remained paused. The council has primarily focused on surviving
after Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and has only recently
managed to start looking toward the future. On the other side of the
Atlantic, US President Donald [[Trump]{.mark} has [launched his own
attack on science through mass firings, cuts in funding, and limitations
to research]{.mark}]{.underline} and education. With this,
[[climate]{.mark} action]{.underline}---a highly cooperative
field---**[[has been put on the back burner]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
will likely remain there for some time. \"The Working Groups are asking
themselves why they are doing this and why they should continue, but it
is crucial that they continue their work, albeit to a lesser degree than
before,\" says Rottem and continues: \"There might not be any direct
political results right now, but it is important to persist even in the
face of geopolitical challenges.\" \"If the working groups were to
disintegrate, it would take a very long time to rebuild those knowledge
networks. We are seeing the start of this in Trump\'s USA right now.\"

[[Global wildlife populations have plunged by an average of 73% in 50
years]{.underline}]{.mark}, a new scientific assessment has found, [[as
humans]{.mark} continue to [push ecosystems to]{.mark} the brink of
[collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Latin America]{.mark} and the
Caribbean [recorded]{.mark} the steepest average declines]{.underline}
in recorded wildlife populations, [with [a 95%
fall]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to the WWF and the Zoological
Society of London's (ZSL) biennial Living Planet report. [They were
followed by [Africa]{.mark} with [76%,]{.mark} and [Asia]{.mark} and the
Pacific at [60%]{.mark}.]{.underline} Europe and North America recorded
comparatively lower falls of 35% and 39% respectively since 1970.
Scientists said this was explained by much larger declines in wildlife
populations in Europe and North America before 1970 that were now being
replicated in other parts of the world. They warned that the loss could
quicken in future years as global heating accelerates, triggered by
tipping points in the Amazon rainforest, Arctic and marine ecosystems,
which could have catastrophic consequences for nature and human society.
Matthew Gould, ZSL's chief executive, said the report's message was
clear: "[We are [dangerously close to tipping points for nature
loss]{.mark}]{.underline} and climate change. But we know nature can
recover, given the opportunity, and that we still have the chance to
act." The figures, known as the Living Planet Index, are made up of
almost 35,000 population trends from 5,495 mammals, birds, fish,
amphibians and reptiles species around the world, and have become one of
the leading indicators of the global state of wildlife populations. In
recent years, the metric has faced criticism for potentially
overestimating wildlife declines. The index is weighted in favour of
data from Africa and Latin America, which have suffered larger declines
but have far less reliable information about populations. This has had
the effect of driving a dramatic top line of global collapse despite
information from Europe and North America showing less dramatic falls.
Hannah Wauchope, an ecology lecturer at Edinburgh University, said: "The
weighting of the Living Planet Index is imperfect, but until we have
systematic sampling of biodiversity worldwide, some form of weighting
will be necessary. What we do know is that as habitat destruction and
other threats to biodiversity continue, there will continue to be
declines." Critics question the mathematical soundness of the index's
approach, but acknowledge that other indicators also show major declines
in the state of many wildlife populations around the world. In a
critique of the index published by Springer Nature in June, scientists
said it "suffers from several mathematical and statistical issues,
leading to a bias towards an apparent decrease even for balanced
populations". They continued: "This does not mean that in reality there
is no overall decrease in vertebrate populations \[but the\] current
phase of the Anthropocene \[epoch\] is characterised by more complex
changes than ... simple disappearance." The IUCN's Red List, which has
assessed the health [[of more than 160,000 plant and animal
species,]{.mark} has found that [almost a third are at risk of
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of those assessed, 41% of amphibians,
26% of mammals and 34% of conifer trees are at risk of disappearing. The
index has been published days ahead of the Cop16 biodiversity summit in
Cali, Colombia, where countries will meet for the first time since
agreeing on a set of international targets to halt the freefall of life
on Earth. Governments have never met a single biodiversity target in the
history of UN agreements and scientists are urging world leaders to make
sure this decade is different. Susana Muhamad, Cop16 president and
Colombia's environment minister, said: "We must listen to science and
take action to avoid collapse. "[[Globally, we are reaching points of no
return and irreversibly affecting the planet's life-support]{.mark}
systems. We are [seeing the effects of deforestation]{.mark} and the
[transformation of natural ecosystems, intensive land use]{.mark} and
climate change.]{.underline} "[The world is witnessing the mass
[bleaching of]{.mark} coral [reefs]{.mark}, the [loss of tropical
forests]{.mark}, the [collapse of]{.mark} polar [ice caps]{.mark} and
serious changes to the water cycle]{.underline}, the foundation of life
on our planet," she said. Land-use change was the most important driver
of the fall in wildlife populations as agricultural frontiers expanded,
often at the expense of ecosystems such as tropical rainforests. Mike
Barrett, director of science and conservation at WWF-UK, said countries
such as the UK were driving the destruction by continuing to import food
and livestock feed grown on previously wild ecosystems. "The data that
we've got shows that the loss was driven by a fragmentation of natural
habitats. What we are seeing through the figures is an indicator of a
more profound change that is going on in our natural ecosystems ...
[they are losing their resilience to external shocks and
change]{.underline}. We are now superimposing climate change on these
already degraded habitats," said Barrett. "I have been involved in
writing these reports for 10 years and, in writing this one, it was
difficult. I was shocked," he said.

Our planet is facing an unprecedented crisis -- the alarming collapse of
biodiversity. [There is mounting evidence that [we may be experiencing
the sixth mass extinction]{.mark}, with species vanishing at an
accelerating rate.]{.underline} The loss of biodiversity has
far-reaching consequences for the ecosystems we rely on for our survival
and will destabilise our world. As the UK Government has set out,
biodiversity loss is nothing less than a national security threat, with
the Government's Integrated Review Refresh 2023 noting 'climate change
and biodiversity loss are important multipliers of other global
threats'. In this blog post, we will discuss the various indicators of
this collapse, its causes, and the urgent need for transformative change
to reverse this dangerous trend. Signs of worldwide biodiversity
Collapse [There is increasing consensus among scientists that the
current rate of species loss is indicative of a mass extinction
event]{.underline}, the likes of which have only occurred five times
before in Earth\'s history. Wherever you look, there is copious evidence
of this deeply worrying trend. [[Since 1970,]{.mark} there has been
[a]{.mark} staggering [68% decrease]{.mark} in population sizes of
mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish globally]{.underline}.
The farmland bird indicator in the UK has dropped to less than half its
value in 1970, highlighting the devastating impact of agricultural
intensification on bird population. And over the past two decades, the
average change in the England priority species index has been a decline
of approximately 2% per year. [[This destruction can be put at
humanity's feet]{.underline}]{.mark}. A recent UN report has found that
[[human]{.mark} activities have significantly [altered three-quarters of
the land-based environment]{.mark}]{.underline} and [about [66% of the
marine environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. From [the exploitation of
natural resources to pollution]{.underline} (plastic pollution has
increased tenfold since 1980), [[humans]{.mark} have driven through
terrible changes to our planet, changes which further
[exacerbate]{.mark}]{.underline}s [[the loss of biodiversity through
habitat degradation]{.mark}, alterations in species distribution, and
the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather
events]{.underline}. [[The steady destruction]{.mark} of wildlife
[can]{.mark} suddenly [tip over into total]{.mark} ecosystem
[collapse]{.mark},]{.underline} as evidenced by the Earth\'s previous
mass extinctions. For example, the Permian-Triassic extinction event,
also known as the \"Great Dying,\" occurred 252 million years ago and
wiped out 95% of life on Earth. This mass extinction was driven by
global heating resulting from massive volcanic eruptions. The research
examining marine fossils found in China from before, during, and after
the Great Dying revealed that healthy ecosystems rely on the complex
interaction of plants, predators, and prey, with each group of similar
species playing a unique role. As species went extinct, ecosystems were
pushed to a tipping point from which they could not recover. Worryingly,
[the ongoing [loss of biodiversity today is even faster than]{.mark}
during [any]{.mark} of the planet\'s [previous mass extinctions]{.mark}.
With species disappearing at a faster rate than in any of Earth\'s past
extinction events, the risk of another, more severe mass extinction is
highly probable.]{.underline} The need for total change [[To]{.mark}
prevent further biodiversity loss and [avert a total ecosystem collapse,
transformative change in our approach to conservation, resource use, and
development is urgently needed]{.mark}]{.underline}. The UN report
emphasises [that **[negative trends]{.mark}**]{.underline} in nature
**[[will continue to 2050 and beyond, except in policy scenarios that
include transformative change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Around the world,
governments are introducing more dramatic solutions to stop biodiversity
collapse. In England, Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) has been introduced as
a major solution. But other strategies for transformative change
include: Protecting and restoring ecosystems: Expanding protected areas,
restoring degraded ecosystems, and promoting landscape-scale
conservation efforts can help maintain and enhance biodiversity, while
also providing valuable ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration
and flood protection. Adopting sustainable agriculture and forestry
practices: Encouraging agroecology, agroforestry, and other sustainable
farming practices can help preserve biodiversity while increasing food
production. Similarly, sustainable forestry practices, such as
reduced-impact logging and the certification of sustainably harvested
timber, can help minimise the impact of timber extraction on
biodiversity. Reducing waste and pollution: Implementing measures to
reduce waste generation, increase recycling, and minimise the release of
pollutants into the environment can help alleviate the pressure on
ecosystems and the species that inhabit them. Promoting sustainable
consumption and production: Encouraging more responsible consumption
patterns and the adoption of circular economy principles can help reduce
the demand for natural resources and minimise the environmental impact
of production processes. Addressing climate change: Mitigating
greenhouse gas emissions and promoting climate resilience are crucial
for safeguarding biodiversity and maintaining the health of ecosystems.
Transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency,
and preserving and restoring carbon sinks, such as forests and wetlands,
are key actions to address climate change. Empowering Indigenous Peoples
and Local Communities: Studies show that biodiversity is better
preserved in areas managed by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities.
Recognising and supporting their rights, knowledge, and conservation
practices can contribute significantly to global biodiversity
conservation efforts. [[Strengthening international cooperation]{.mark}
and governance: Biodiversity conservation requires global cooperation,
with [nations working together to establish and enforce conservation
policies]{.mark}, share resources and knowledge, and promote sustainable
development. [The ongoing collapse of biodiversity is an urgent crisis
that requires immediate and transformative action]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The loss of species and ecosystems not only threatens the stability of
our planet but also has profound implications for human well-being. As
the evidence of biodiversity loss continues to mount, it is crucial that
we recognise the interdependence between human societies and the natural
world, and take decisive steps to safeguard our planet\'s biodiversity
for future generations. By implementing transformative changes in our
approach to conservation, resource use, and development, we can help
ensure the survival of the countless species that share our planet and
the ecosystems upon which we all depend.

Our experts continually monitor the BNG space, and we update our
articles when new information becomes available.

The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds
other than CO2 could also portend existential risks. Here the answer is
not clear. **[One boundary often mentioned as a concern for the fate of
global civilization is biodiversity]{.underline}** (Ehrlich & Ehrlich,
2012), with the proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than
0.001% per year (Rockström et al., 2009). **[There is little evidence
that this particular 0.001% annual loss is a
threshold]{.underline}**---**[and it is hard to imagine any data that
would allow one to identify where the threshold was]{.underline}**
(Brook, Ellis, Perring, Mackay, & Blomqvist, 2013; Lenton & Williams,
2013). A better question is whether one can imagine any scenario by
which the loss of too many species leads to the collapse of societies
and environmental disasters, even though one cannot know the absolute
number of extinctions that would be required to create this dystopia.

**[While [there are data that relate local reductions in species
richness]{.mark} to altered ecosystem function, [these results do not
point to]{.mark} substantial [existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The **[data are small-scale experiments in which plant productivity, or
nutrient retention is reduced as species numbers decline
locally]{.underline}** (Vellend, 2017), or are local observations of
increased variability in fisheries yield when stock diversity is lost
(Schindler et al., 2010). **[Those are not existential
risks]{.underline}**. **[To make the link even more tenuous, [there is
little ev]{.mark}idence that [biod]{.mark}iversity [is]{.mark} even
[declining at local scales]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Vellend et al., 2013,
Vellend et al., 2017). **[Total [planetary biod]{.mark}iversity [may be
in decline, but local]{.mark} and regional [biod]{.mark}iversity [is
often staying the same because species from elsewhere replace]{.mark}
local [losses]{.mark}]{.underline}**, albeit homogenizing the world in
the process. Although the majority of conservation scientists are likely
to flinch at this conclusion, **[there is growing skepticism regarding
the strength of evidence linking trends in biodiversity loss to an
existential risk for humans]{.underline}** (Maier, 2012; Vellend, 2014).
**[Obviously [if all biod]{.mark}iversity [disappeared civilization
would end]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[but no one is forecasting]{.mark}
the loss of [all species]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It seems plausible that
the loss of 90% of the world's species could also be apocalyptic, but
not one is predicting that degree of biodiversity loss either. Tragic,
but plausible is the possibility of our planet suffering a loss of as
many as half of its species. **[If global biodiversity were halved, but
at the same time locally the number of species stayed relatively stable,
what would be the mechanism for an end-of-civilization or even end of
human prosperity scenario?]{.underline}** **[Extinctions and

diversity. [We add [data on species]{.mark} rarity to [show]{.mark} that
ongoing [biodiversity]{.mark} [loss is **unlikely** to **hamper**
ecosystem productivity]{.mark}]{.underline}, a core insight we feel the
authors missed.

Main text

Brun et al. (2022) present important new results regarding the
controversial relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function.
Studying plant communities from the French and Swiss Alps, they assessed
if the presence or abundance of certain plant species were linked to
higher levels of pivotal ecosystem functions, here primary productivity.
They identified 'key' species, which have a decisive role in overall
productivity, and 'keystone' species, which have disproportionally large
productivity effects given their abundance, and which are a subset of
the key species. Out of 2918 plant species found, they identified 38 key
species, of which 11 qualified as keystone species. They found that the
five key species with largest effects on productivity jointly explained
more deviance in ecosystem productivity than any measure of functional
composition. The results provide evidence supporting the Trait Driver
Theory (Enquist et al. 2015), which is related to the 'mass-ratio
hypothesis' (Grime 1998; Garnier et al. 2004), and against the
'complementary resource use hypothesis' (Naeem et al. 1994). Key and
keystone species were found to be taller and have higher than average
specific leaf area.

Brun et al. (2022) state in their introduction that understanding the
relationships between species richness, functional traits and ecosystem
function "is pivotal for assessing the impacts of biodiversity loss".
Their study builds on solid empirical data, a strong analytical
framework and deals with real-world communities, shaped by abiotic
environmental filtering and non-artificial extinction processes,
something rarely undertaken (e.g. Vile et al. 2006; Mokanyet al. 2008).
Therefore, we miss an explicit evaluation of the assumptions underlying
the 'rivet-popper hypothesis' (Ehrlich & Ehrlich 1981). In this powerful
narrative, the popping rivets leading to the crash of the plane are
juxtaposed to species going extinct, leading to ecosystem collapse. The
metaphor has inspired and gained some support from the so-called random
deletion experiments (e.g. Tilman et al. 1997; Hector et al. 1999), in
which all species are assumed to have equal extinction probability.

We plotted a rank-abundance diagram of the species in the data of Brun
et al. (2022) based on their regional occupancy (using mean local
abundance yielded qualitatively equal results, with a strong positive
correlation between regional occupancy and local abundance; Spearman rho
= 0.93, p \<\< 0.001). [We categorized species as either key, keystone,
redlisted or other and superimposed species]{.underline} category on the
diagram (Fig. 1). Redlist status was derived from the redlists for
vascular plants of Switzerland (Bornand et al. 2016) and the French
region Rhˆone-Alpes (Kristo et al. 2015). We found that key and keystone
species strongly tended to be regionally widespread and locally abundant
species, whereas species threatened with regional extinction were found
in the tail of the rank-abundance distribution. [A one-way anova of
difference in log-transformed frequencies revealed that key and keystone
species did not differ in abundance but were both significantly more
abundant than all other categories and that redlisted species were
significantly less abundant than all other categories]{.underline} (p
\<\< 0.001, TukeyHSD). [[It appears evident that]{.mark} the
[contribution of **rare species** to ecosystem **productivity** is a
weak argument]{.mark} for conservation actions in their
favour]{.underline}. In fact, Fig. 2a of the original paper shows that
many species leads to reduced ecosystem productivity when present.

A revised version of Ehrlich's aeroplane metaphor could sound: The wings
are effectively attached to the body of the plane by a small number of
large rivets of key importance, while numerous small rivets, most of
which tiny as needles, serve no other function than mere decoration
(Gould & Lewontin 1979). [[The biodiversity **crisis**]{.mark} and its
derived biotic homogenization **[implies]{.mark}** that already common
[**key species** increase in occupancy and **abundance**]{.mark},
[while]{.mark} initially [**un-common** species]{.mark} decrease or
[vanish]{.mark} **completely**]{.underline} (Finderup Nielsen et al.
2019; Kempel et al. 2020).

[[There is solid **evidence** for **loss** of]{.mark} endangered
[species]{.mark} **disproportionately** happening [in
**low-productive**]{.mark} **natural [ecosystems]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Walker et al. 2004; Wassen et al. 2005), [[which]{.mark} [we
show]{.mark} have **[very low extinction risk]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Moreover, [t[he plant **species** critical to human sustenance are all
**superabundant crops**]{.mark}, such as wheat, corn and
rice]{.underline}. [We propose it is time the scientific **community
acknowledge** that arguments for [**biodiversity** conservation should

decomposition rate or -- in general -- in efficiency of ecosystem

\"John Nichols: Russ Feingold is making an issue of biodiversity", The
Capital Times -- Maidson, , 01-07-2020

When the United Nations welcomed heads of state to the 1992 Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro, a global consensus was reached to take vital steps to
save the planet. To that end, more than 170 nations gave their support
to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. But it was not the
only treaty at the summit. There was also a Convention on Biological
Diversity. **[The climate change treaty is well understood
internationally --- even if the Trump administration and its
congressional allies continue to engage in dangerous denialism and
obstruction.]{.underline}** The biological diversity treaty is less well
understood, especially in the U.S., which has yet to join the more than
190 parties to the agreement. In 2020, Russ Feingold wants to change
that. Working as an ambassador for an ambitious international Campaign
for Nature, Feingold will in the new year be using his prominence --- as
a former three-term senator from Wisconsin who later served as the U.S.
Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region of Africa --- to get an urgent
conversation going in Africa (where he is highly regarded for his
long-term commitment to the continent) and in the U.S. "The first thing
is you have to get a baseline awareness of what the problem is," said
Feingold, who acknowledges that "there is a huge learning curve." Huge.
But not insurmountable. So let's start 2020 by putting things in
perspective. This is how Feingold explained things: "**[A major report
from 150 leading scientists from around the world released on May 6,
2019, shows that [the crisis facing wildlife]{.mark} and nature
[is]{.mark} even [worse than previously understood]{.mark}. Up to a
million species are threatened with extinction, many within decades. And
the threats posed to people from the destruction of nature are just as
serious as those posed by climate change]{.underline}**." As a senator
and a special envoy, Feingold was passionate about addressing climate
change, and he remains so now. But he wants people to know that the
climate crisis and the extinction threat pose distinct challenges. "If
you say something to people about (the destruction of nature), they look
at you and they go, 'Oh. Climate change.' Yet, it's not the same!" he
explained. Of course, the former senator said, **[climate and
biodiversity concerns are "crucially interrelated]{.underline}**." Of
course, he added, "We have to understand both of them and respond to
both of them." But Feingold wants people to recognize that when
scientists describe **[[the five]{.mark} key [causes of the loss of
biodiversity]{.mark}, "[Climate]{.mark} change is third! It\'s
enormously important. But first is [land use]{.mark} --- agriculture,
mining --- just impinging on forests or natural areas. Second is what\'s
called 'the exploitation of organisms': [hunting, overfishing,
cutting]{.mark} down [trees]{.mark}. That\'s not climate. That\'s just
harvesting stuff." (Fourth is [pollution]{.mark}. Fifth is [invasive
species]{.mark}.)]{.underline}** So this is another urgent issue to
concern ourselves with at a time when there are already so many urgent
issues. Feingold acknowledges that it may be daunting to think about
additional threats and additional challenges. But, he explained, we are
not starting from scratch. Real work has been done to address the
crisis. Countries have not just signed on to the biological diversity
treaty. Many have acted. As the Campaign for Nature noted, "world
leaders have committed to protecting 17 percent of land and 10 percent
of the ocean by 2020 and governments are on track to meet these global
targets." **[The [progress toward meeting these goals has been
impressive.]{.mark} Today, Feingold noted, roughly "15 percent of land
and 7 percent of the ocean are protected globally, but individual
[countries]{.mark} have helped [demonstrate]{.mark} that more [ambitious
targets]{.mark} are possible to meet. Ninety countries have protected
more than 17 percent of their land (the current global target), 27 have
already protected more than 30 percent, and a few --- including Namibia,
Bhutan and Venezuela --- are close to or even past protecting half of
their land."]{.underline}** That's the good news. **[Unfortunately,
Feingold noted, "The scientists are now saying, 'Guess what? We\'re not
there, and [that\'s not even adequate]{.mark}.' They are saying [we need
30-by-30 and 50-by-50]{.mark}." As in: [30 percent protected by 2030 and
50 percent protected by 2050]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

pessimistic about Arctic Council members, including Russia, resuming
co-operation by the end of September 2022,"15) with most instead seeing
the most likely scenario being that [[Russia]{.mark} and the other
members of the Arctic Circle be [unable to resume their regular
operations]{.mark} in the near future]{.underline}. In spite of this,
commentary in the Financial Times16) and Foreign Policy17) has argued
that Western efforts at cooperation must be made with Russia in the
Arctic. While these experts certainly [do not ignore the realities of
the Ukraine]{.underline}-Russia conflict, [there appears to be a desire
to disregard these events in favor of keeping the status quo that has
long existed in the Arctic]{.underline}. No matter the desire to see a
return to normalcy or continue operations in the Arctic, [[while it is
important to ensure continuity, it is also important to protect human
rights and work against those who are continuing to engage in illegal or
criminal activities with no indication or inclination to
stop.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[By continually **refusing** to work with
Russia]{.mark} in the Arctic Circle]{.underline}, [[the]{.underline}
[Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is applying
**pressure**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to]{.underline} the
[Russia]{.underline}n Federation [in coordination with the international
community and the rest of the West]{.underline}. Certainly, the
nation-states that make up the Council do realize that this lack of
participation with Russia does spell issues for the Council as a whole
and in terms of properly governing and regulating the region, yet they
understand that [[what Russia is doing in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}
(flagrantly violating international law, indiscriminately killing
Ukrainian civilians, torturing and mutilating combatants and prisoners
of war, suppressing their own domestic population, and using sexual
assault as a weapon of war) [[matters far more than the current
stability of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} Circle. To them, and to the
vast majority of individuals, [[protecting human rights and stopping
**totalitarian** regimes]{.mark} matters more than maintaining the
status quo of a region.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Human Rights Turn

#### We cannot forget Russia's war crimes in Ukraine in the rush to normalize relations

**Amnesty International 2025**. "Ukraine/Russia: Three years since
Russia's full-scale invasion, justice for victims must be a global
priority " Amnesty International February 24, 2025.
\<https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/02/ukraine-russia-three-years-since-russias-full-scale-invasion-justice-for-victims-must-be-a-global-priority/\>
Accessed 7/2/25. ARJSH

Ahead of the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of
Ukraine and amid the start of U.S.-Russia peace talks, Agnès Callamard,
Amnesty International's Secretary General, said: "At a time when the US
President is seeking to re-write the history of the last decade, and
particularly of the last three years, [the 3rd anniversary of the
Russian aggression is a stark reminder of]{.underline} how much the
people of Ukraine have endured and lost; of [the devastation that Russia
has waged against Ukraine."]{.underline} "Any negotiations over the
future of the people of Ukraine must [[prioritize justice for all crimes
under international law committed since Russia's military intervention
in 2014]{.underline}]{.mark}, accountability for those responsible, and
reparations for victims of Russia's aggression. [Past
suffering]{.underline}, including deadly Russian airstrikes on civilians
and the forcible transfer of children to Russia, [[must not be
forgotten]{.mark} or left unaddressed.]{.underline} Those most impacted
by Russia's war of aggression must have their voices heard and their
needs met, and [[any negotiated outcome that does not account for this
will fail in the long-term]{.underline}]{.mark}. "On the third
anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion, we demand justice,
accountability, and reparation -- as well as meaningful participation in
the peace process -- for the Ukrainian civilians abducted by Russian
security services, prisoners of war tortured and unlawfully convicted,
children threatened for studying Ukrainian online, teachers in
Russian-occupied Ukraine subjected to forced labour in schools reopened
under a Russian curriculum, and Crimean Tatars and other minorities who
face brutal suppression as Russia seeks to alter the demographics of
occupied territories. [[Without ending these ongoing violations]{.mark}
immediately and strong guarantees for justice]{.underline}, a rushed
'peace deal' [will [only]{.mark} prolong their suffering and [ensure
impunity for the perpetrators of heinous rights
violations]{.mark}.]{.underline} "U.S. Secretary of State Rubio said
last week that President Trump wants to end the war in a way that is
sustainable and enduring. [A genuine commitment by President
Trump]{.underline} to securing lasting peace in Ukraine must be
delivered not in words but in actions -- [including supporting all
possible avenues for real justice and accountability for those suspected
of war crimes and all crimes under international law."]{.underline}
Background Amnesty International has documented widespread violations of
international human rights and humanitarian law in Ukraine since
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} full-scale
[[invasion]{.underline}]{.mark} began on 24 February 2022, including
acts that [[amount to war crimes and]{.underline}]{.mark} likely
[[crimes against humanity.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine constitutes aggression, which is a crime under
international law. Its strategy and tactics]{.underline}, including
continued use of indiscriminate weapons and deliberate targeting of
civilians, [have caused widespread human suffering and seriously
impacted Ukraine's most vulnerable people, including children and older
people]{.underline}. Since March 2023, [the]{.underline} International
Criminal [Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants against]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin and]{.underline} several [senior
Russian officials]{.underline}. The Trump administration's focus on a
negotiated settlement has renewed attention on the war, but its
executive order imposing sanctions against the ICC earlier this month
undermines the rights of victims and survivors of international crimes
in Ukraine and beyond.

Why [the **Next War** Will Be Won or Lost in the **Arctic**]{.underline}

[[Climate change]{.mark} has **[accelerated]{.mark}** strategic
[**competition** in the]{.mark}]{.underline} region among both
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and non-Arctic nations, such as China.
[[Melting **sea ice**]{.mark} from rising global temperatures has
[created]{.mark} **new [military]{.mark}** and economic
**[opportunities]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the region. Since 1979, the
Arctic has warmed four times faster than the rest of the world,
according to an August 2022 scientific study published in Nature.3) As
ice rapidly melts in the Arctic, [[increased access to]{.mark}
**critical [rare earth]{.mark}** [elements]{.mark}, such as platinum,
copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel emerge]{.underline}. Moreover,
melting ice is opening [more **easily traversed** Arctic
waters]{.underline}, which has [led to a **surge** of both military and
commercial **ship activity**]{.underline} in the region. [These two
developments have **[increased]{.mark}** the [potential for
**conflict**]{.mark} in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[Any nation that can effectively **mine**]{.underline}, process, and
refine [the materials will have a **strategic advantage**]{.underline}.
These minerals are required for developing technologies ranging from
renewable energy systems to electronics used for national defense.
According to the World Bank, the demand to produce minerals, many of
which are found in the Arctic, could increase by nearly 500 percent by
2050 to meet the growing demand for clean energy technologies.4) China
already dominates the global supply chain for critical materials. [The
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [depends on these
materials for its economic **competitiveness** and **national
defense**]{.underline}.5)

As ice melts, [**[new routes]{.mark}** are emerging that are **more
navigable**. This has [resulted in more **ship
activity**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region. For instance, the Arctic
Council Working Group on the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment
reports that there has been a 37 percent increase in ship numbers and
distance sailed in the Arctic over the past ten years.6) While much of
this activity is commercial, [[**Russia** and **China** have]{.mark}
also [taken advantage]{.mark} of the new sea routes [to
**project**]{.mark} their **[naval power]{.mark}**. They]{.underline}
have [carried out numerous **regional deployments** and patrols,
demonstrating their **ability** to execute **military operations** in
the]{.underline} austere [**Arctic** climate]{.underline}.7) [[The
**expanded presence**]{.mark} of Russian and Chinese **ships** in the
region [poses a **growing threat**]{.mark} to **NATO**]{.underline}
member states. In October 2023, Finnish investigators suspected the
Chinese vessel NewNew Polar Bear of dragging its anchor over the seabed
and severing three Baltic telecom cables and one pipeline. While the
international community has not assigned blame wholly to China, China
later admitted to accidentally destroying an important gas pipeline
connecting Finland and Estonia in the Baltic Sea in 2024. These examples
suggest that incidents of this nature could become more likely as
military activity increases in the region.8)

Competition in the Arctic Is Heating Up: Russian and Chinese Ambitions

[The **growing partnership** between Russia and China provides **early
warning** signs]{.underline} that the region could become a site of
future conflict. In 2021 Russia and China renewed their 20-year-old
Sino-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, a
move described as "an act of friendship against America."9) Moreover,
both [[Russia and China have deep]{.mark} **historic** and **economic
[ties]{.mark}** to the **Arctic**]{.underline}. NATO's expansion to
include Finland and Sweden have increased tensions in the region, while
[both Russia and China have expressed their **disapproval** of NATO's
**increasing presence**]{.underline} in the Arctic.10) However, despite
feeling antagonized by NATO's actions, Moscow and Beijing may not have
the economic and military capacities to reshape the current
international rules-based order in the Arctic in the near term.

Despite being the only non-NATO member in the Arctic, Russia controls
over 53 percent of the Arctic coastline, making it a decisive player in
the future of the region.11) Yet, Russia's Arctic ambitions are not new.
Russia's connection with the Arctic can be traced back to the sixteenth
century, beginning with its conquest of Siberia, which was part of a
larger initiative to search for resources and trade routes.12) As the
nation matured, its Arctic ambitions did as well. During the Cold War,
the Soviets established both a nuclear and naval presence on the Kola
Peninsula to project power against the U.S. With the collapse of the
Soviet Union, Russia, as the de jure inheritor of the Soviet nuclear
arsenal, did not abandon its desire to be an Arctic power.

As the Russian economy recovered in the early 2000s under Vladimir
Putin, Russia began posturing for Arctic supremacy, reopening multiple
Soviet-era military bases, modernizing its navy, and developing new
hypersonic missiles designed to evade U.S. sensors and defenses.13)
Moreover, in August 2022, Moscow announced that it would refocus its
military power on the Arctic and Nordic region.14) According to Colin
Wall, a research associate at Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, "[[The]{.mark} military [balance]{.mark} in the
Arctic [is **heavily weighted** towards Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}."
Furthermore, the International Institute for Strategic Studies and
Reuters cite that [Russia's **bases** inside the Arctic Circle
**outnumber** NATO's by roughly a third]{.underline}.15) [[Russia's
**remilitarization**]{.mark} of the Arctic [and]{.mark} its revitalized
**strategic [partnership]{.mark}** [with China]{.mark}, provides both
countries with the means to [**challenge** the]{.mark}
current]{.underline} Western rules-based **[[international
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Although China's Arctic history does not mirror Russia's centuries-old
presence in the north, Beijing's desire for Arctic supremacy has rapidly
evolved over the past century. China's involvement in the Arctic began
in 1925 with the signing of the Svalbard Treaty, providing a legal basis
for China to conduct non-military activity, such as scientific
exploration, resource extraction, and fishing in the Arctic.16) However,
China's rationale to operate in the region extends beyond scientific
exploration.

In 2018 China released its first Arctic White Paper, which asserts that
it is a "Near-Arctic State."17) China employs a dual narrative to
explain its aims in the Arctic. Externally, Beijing appeals to foreign
audiences by advocating for the safeguarding of international interests
and promoting sustainable Arctic development. However, this is
juxtaposed against the narrative it promotes for domestic audiences,
which emphasizes competition for resources and China's desire to become
a "polar great power."18) [The Svalbard Treaty has currently **enabled**
[China]{.mark} to **[shroud]{.mark}** its [military activity]{.mark} and
influence [in the Arctic as **scientific exploration**]{.mark} and
global cooperation. But it is becoming clear from its growing
**partnership** with Russia and increasingly **aggressive** military
action]{.underline} in the Arctic [that China's intentions to
**reshape** the international system extend **well beyond** the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. The U.S. and NATO would be wise to recognize
China's aims in the Arctic.

The historic ties of Russia and China and their Arctic ambitions reveal
that [[the Arctic is]{.mark} likely to be [an **arena** for]{.mark}
future strategic **[competition]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[Russia's]{.underline} 2022 [**invasion** of Ukraine has temporarily
**bolstered** the West's position in the **Arctic**, as previously
neutral Finland and Sweden **joined NATO**]{.underline}. Finland's
accession into NATO not only increased the NATO-Russia land border by
over 650 percent and moved the defense alliance a mere 250 miles from
St. Petersburg, but it also contributed to creating a divided Arctic,
where nearly half belongs to NATO while the remaining half is Russian
territory.

Threatened by the growing alliance, in June 2022, Putin warned that if
U.S.-NATO military contingents or military infrastructure appears in
either Sweden or Finland, Russia will respond "symmetrically" by
deploying nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea region to restore military
balance and strengthen its defenses.19) In February 2023,
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} made good on this threat and
[[deployed]{.mark} Russian ships armed with [tactical **nuclear
weapons** to the Baltic]{.mark} Sea]{.underline}. According to Norway,
this was [the first time in **30 years**]{.underline} that this has
happened.20) Then in June 2024, Moscow began to train soldiers and
sailors to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Leningrad, a military
district bordering NATO members Norway, Finland, Poland, Estonia,
Latvia, and Lithuania.21) As evidenced by these actions, while Putin is
not afraid to rattle the nuclear saber, it is not likely that Russia has
the military or economic capacity to engage in a direct conventional
conflict with NATO.

NATO leaders recognize that [there is a **finite window** of time to
prepare for **conflict** against Russia]{.underline}. In 2024 the head
of the Norwegian armed forces warned that [[NATO]{.mark} countries [only
have]{.mark} **two to [three years]{.mark}** [to **prepare** for a
Russian attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. Norwegian General Eirik
Kristoffersen claims that [Moscow is **building up** its military
stockpile **faster** than previously predicted, while Western nations
have **depleted** their own weapons by supplying them to
Ukraine]{.underline}.22) Several other European leaders have echoed
these concerns, citing that they have between three and eight years to
prepare for a Russian attack against NATO.23) Despite Russia's
aggressive rhetoric, Moscow understands that because of its war against
Ukraine it likely will not have the capability to attack NATO in the
near future. For instance, Russia removed nearly all its ground forces
from the Finnish border to Ukraine in June 2024.24) Russia's timeframe
to launch a successful attack is dependent not only on its economy but
also on its partnership with the PRC.

American Grand Strategy

The 2009 [Arctic Region Policy shifted away from the apathetic post-Cold
War US Arctic strategy]{.underline}, recognizing the Arctic as an
emerging critical region but only identified two focal points: energy
and security.19) The 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region was
comprehensive, addressing the Pillars of security, climate
change/environmental protection, sustainable development, and
international governance. [**[Changes in]{.mark}** the [physical,
financial, and geopolitical landscape]{.mark} have shifted American
grand strategy in the Arctic, [endi]{.mark}ng the previous three
[decades of stability]{.mark}]{.underline} following the Cold War and
reflecting rising geopolitical tensions between Russia and Arctic
stakeholders.

Energy

The US is vested in the Arctic's oil and natural gas, with Alaska's
Prudhoe Bay Oil Field being North America's most prominent; in the
2000s, Prudhoe Bay typically produced about 8% of America's domestic
oil.20) The importance of Arctic oil to America's energy independence
was demonstrated in 2006 when a leak in a critical pipeline at Prudhoe
Bay forced the line's shutdown while the US and Iran were in a dispute.
At the same time, tensions in the Middle East made it difficult for the
US to buy reasonably priced foreign oil. The total cost of oil increased
3% domestically.21)

[The 2009 Arctic Region Policy aimed to increase US oil independence by
accessing Alaskan oil deposits. While it received support from energy
independence advocates, it was also met with [resistance from
environmentalists]{.mark}, thus [hindering
implementation]{.mark}]{.underline}.22) This debate persisted over the
years, shaping subsequent approaches to Arctic resource development. The
Trump administration (2021) issued drilling leases on more than 400,000
acres in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.23) In contrast, the
2022 National Strategy for the Arctic acknowledges the region's economic
reliance on hydrocarbon production while advocating for economic
diversification, a transition to green energy and environmental
protection.24) In 2024, the US Department of the Interior denied
commercial access to a copper deposit through Gates of the Arctic
National Park. It banned oil drilling in half of the National Petroleum
Reserve-Alaska.25) Environmentalists and tribal leaders praised these
decisions, but Alaska's officials criticized them.26)

The [[relationship between environmentalism and
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} [[complicates]{.underline}]{.mark} the US
grand strategy in the Arctic, [[creating
inconsistency]{.underline}]{.mark} due to fluctuating politics, public
opinion, and stakeholder support. This [[makes long-term planning for
Arctic energy difficult, as leadership changes can shift priorities
between resource extraction and environmental protections and alter the
trajectory of US Arctic strategy. Such volatility
hampers]{.underline}]{.mark} coherent, long-term [[policies essential
for the region's energy security and ecological
sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark}, making it a contentious issue
influenced by electoral outcomes and shifting public opinion.

In 2023, [[Russia updated]{.mark} its [Arctic]{.mark} State
[Policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, Arctic Strategy, and Foreign Policy
Concept, [[with]{.mark} significant [implications]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
Arctic [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In February 2023, Putin
approved amendments to the Foundations of Russia's Arctic State Policy
for the Period up to 2035 and the Strategy for the Development of the
Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation and Provision of National Security
for the Period up to 2035.

While the 2020 Arctic State Policy included the goal of '[strengthening
good-will bilateral relations with the Arctic States as well as regional
cooperation]{.underline} fora, including the Arctic Council, the Arctic
Five, and the Barents Euro-Arctic Council', the 2023 amendments removed
references to 'strengthening good-will relations', 'Arctic States', and
the multilateral cooperation fora. Although the docu- ment still
stresses the pre-eminence of the Arctic Council as the key platform for
regional cooperation, the update emphasized Arctic cooperation on a
bilateral basis with 'foreign States' rather than specifically with
Arctic States. This shift suggests that [[Russia is increasingly focused
on engaging with non-Arctic States, such as China, rather than the
Western Arctic States]{.underline}]{.mark} within the Arctic Council.41
The new 2023 Foreign Policy Concept of Russia highlights the Arctic as
one of the top regional priorities, whereas previously it was discussed
within the context of Western policy. As with the 2023 Arctic State
Policy, the 2023 [Foreign Policy Concept advocates for mutually
beneficial cooperation but places greater emphasis on collaboration with
non-Arctic States. [Notably, the Concept does not mention working with
Arctic States or regional institutions]{.mark} in its section on the
Arctic.]{.underline}

The Arctic section of the Concept declares that [[Russia is focused on
'counter- acting]{.mark} the policy of [unfriendly States aimed at
militarizing the region and limiting Russia's ability to exercise its
sovereign rights in the Arctic zone of the Russian
Federation']{.mark}]{.underline}.42 Russia's political leadership has
not abandoned international cooperation, but it has adjusted its
approach in response to the evolving global context.

### 1NC -- Russia Says No (Competition)

#### Russia has locked in countering the US in the Arctic. Militarization and Chinese partnership aids in their ability to challenge the US globally

The US will expand its military readiness and surveillance [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} [given heightened Chinese and Russian
interest]{.underline} coupled with new risks brought on by accelerating
climate change, the Pentagon said in a new report. Measures are needed
"to ensure the Arctic does not become a strategic blind spot" as melting
ice makes the region more accessible economically and militarily,
according to the Defense Department's 2024 Arctic Strategy released
Monday. Priorities include better surveillance of the vast region, as
well as research into space-based missile warning systems, deeper
coordination across NATO and with Canada through the North American
Aerospace Defense Command, and improved satellite and data
communications. The Pentagon also said it needs better modeling and
forecasting of the rapidly changing environment to prepare for potential
combat in increasingly unpredictable conditions so far north. The
Pentagon highlighted [[concern]{.underline}]{.mark} over [[a "growing
alignment" between China and Russia]{.mark}, Washington's two top
national security competitors.]{.underline} "[[Melting Arctic ice caps
are]{.underline}]{.mark} opening new shipping lanes and [[attracting
increased interest and activity from both]{.mark} the People's Republic
of China and Russia,"]{.underline} Kathleen Hicks, Deputy Secretary of
Defense, said during a briefing Monday. [China is "the only strategic
competitor with the will and increasingly the wherewithal to remake the
international order" while Russia "continues to pose an acute threat to
security and stability in the region." [Russia's invasion of Ukraine has
isolated it]{.mark} from the seven other nations that ring the
Arctic,]{.underline} all of them now members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, [[and made it more dependent on
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is pursuing its own agenda in the
region. Arctic countries in North America and Europe have also found
themselves facing new threats, from GPS jamming to alleged spy balloons.
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, while not an Arctic nation[, [is
attempting to gain influence, access]{.mark} "and play a larger role in
regional governance." It operates three icebreakers in the region for
dual civil-military research and has tested unmanned underwater vehicles
and polar-capable fixed-wing aircraft,]{.underline} the Pentagon said.
The Arctic is warming multiple times faster than any other region on
earth, [creating opportunities for countries with Arctic coastlines to
exploit still largely theoretical mineral and energy
resources.]{.underline} The region's strategic importance is also
changing as sea ice melts, meaning the Bering Strait between Alaska and
Russia and the Barents Sea north of Norway "are becoming more navigable
and more economically and militarily significant," according to the
report. "Climate change and the resulting shifts in the operating
environment require us to rethink how we best protect our war fighters
and prevent conflict," Hicks said. Russia continues to invest in new
military infrastructure and refurbish Soviet-era installations in the
region. As well, its Northern Fleet is based in the Kola Peninsula,
along with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. [[Russia has "a clear
avenue of approach to the US homeland through the Arctic" and could use
its capabilities there to stop the US from responding to crises in
Europe or the Indo-Pacific region]{.mark}. Its maritime infrastructure
could also allow it to control the Northern Sea Route, even in areas
where it has no legal claims, according to the report.]{.underline} "The
United States is an Arctic nation, and the region is critical to the
defense of our homeland, the protection of US national sovereignty and
our defense treaty commitments," Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in
an attached memo. "Major geopolitical changes are driving the need for
this new strategic approach to the Arctic."

Against all odds.

The meeting\'s framework is the Arctic Council, an organisation
comprising eight Arctic countries that insist on its own significance.
[The community]{.underline}, which was once celebrated with pomp and
splendor at a ministerial level, [has been **reduced** to a **digital
meeting** between ambassadors. It is **not even certain** whether all
countries will **show up**.]{.underline} Stopped funding Ahead of the
meeting, [[Russia has **withdrawn**]{.mark} its financial
**[support]{.mark}** to the council, and is **not willing** to accept
its reduced influence]{.underline} after the cooperation with the other
seven countries was put on hold after the invasion of Ukraine.
**[[Conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather than community
[**[characterize]{.mark}** international
[organisations]{.mark}]{.underline}, which are tied together by
geographic rather than ideological cooperation. A masterclass in
diplomacy prevented collapse. The meeting in Tromsø marks the transition
from Norwegian to Danish/Greenlandic leadership - a transfer made
possible because Norway has prevented a complete collapse, holding a
masterclass in diplomacy. And two questions arise: Does the Arctic
Council have any value in itself? And is there even a common foundation
for continued cooperation? The answer to the latter is complicated. [The
**conflict** with [Russia]{.mark} is **well-known**. It is about a
member country that [is **sanctioned** and banned politically and
institutionally]{.mark}]{.underline}, but still participates in the
working groups. Fears war In other words, Russia as a nation is not
excluded. This is important because the Arctic Council is more about
research cooperation than political cooperation in the current
situation. Lighting a fuse under the Arctic cooperation. Then add that
PM Jonas Gahr Støre, only days before the council \"gathers\", told his
own population to be prepared for war. This happened in connection with
the presentation of Norway\'s new security strategy, and the war threat
comes from Russia. During the two years Norway has led the Arctic
Council work, [[a **new enemy** of]{.mark} international
[cooperation]{.mark} has [**appeared**.]{.mark} Donald
**[Trump]{.mark}**. He has also used the past few days to **light a
fuse** under that cooperation.]{.underline} The other day, [[he
**reiterated**]{.mark} the message of considering [using **military
power** to take **Greenland**]{.mark} from Denmark]{.underline}. When
Denmark takes the chairship, it also takes the chairship over a nation
that directly threatens its national borders. Threatens own members
However, [Trump is **not content** with **threatening** just one of the
member countries. [**Canada** was]{.mark} also
[told]{.mark}]{.underline} a few days ago [that [the country should
**cease** to be]{.mark} an **[independent]{.mark}** nation [and]{.mark}
be [incorporated as a **US state**]{.mark}. Trump\'s absurd
**megalomania**]{.underline}. The ambitions, if I can use such a mild
expression about [[Trump\'s]{.mark} absurd [**megalomania**, are]{.mark}
strongly [**condemned** by both]{.mark} Canada and Denmark]{.underline}.
However, [Trump\'s [**obstacles** to]{.mark} Arctic [cooperation extend
**further**]{.mark} than that]{.underline}. Under the Danish chairship,
two policy areas in particular are highlighted: [[**climate** and
**indigenous peoples**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is emphasized

If we look to the west, there are also dark clouds on the horizon, which
portend another challenge for the Arctic Council: Donald Trump's USA.
During President Trump's first term, we saw how then-Secretary of State,
Mike Pompeo, spoke harshly against China and Russia, and did not share
the other member states' view that human activities are the main driver
behind climate change and pose an existential threat. This resulted in
the Finnish chairship failing to conclude a joint declaration in 2019,
which was the first time in the history of the Arctic Council. [[Donald
Trump's]{.mark} persistent [interest in Greenland]{.mark} [may]{.mark}
also [prove to be a serious challenge]{.mark} for the chairship during
the next two years.]{.underline} While the threat, on the one hand, may
bring Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands closer together, there is
also an increased risk of American attempts to create discord in the
realm. Thus, Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands are under a
historically high cross-pressure, which transforms the chairship from
being a big task to an enormous one. The need for increased council
activity Norway's chairship in 2023-2025 has managed to balance the
situation and keep the council alive by gradually ramping up its
activities. For the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroese chairship to be a
success, it would be wise to continue on the same path with steadily
increasing activity to ensure that the council's pulse continues to
beat. However, the fact that the threat now both comes from the east and
the west makes the balancing act historically difficult. [O[ne
opportunity for increasing activity is to further enhance the focus on
the rights of Indigenous peoples in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}
[--]{.mark} which the new chairship program, indeed, prioritizes -- in
order to strengthen regional cooperation [[without necessarily having to
compromise on condemning Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the situation
allows, something as ambitious as a binding agreement on increased
protection of Indigenous peoples' rights in the Arctic would be worth
striving for, similar to the council's three existing agreements on
aeronautical and maritime search and rescue (2011), marine oil pollution
preparedness and response (2013), and enhancing international Arctic
scientific cooperation (2017). [[It may not sound like something Trump
would want a stake in,]{.mark} but there is a chance that [the Arctic
Council does not have his attention whatsoever]{.mark} due to its
limited activity]{.underline} -- and because there are plenty of other
things that keep him occupied. If that is the case, it may actually
prove to be an advantage for the Arctic Council, which under normal
circumstances would otherwise strengthen its relevance if meetings were
prioritized by the highest political level. However, its current fragile
existence and the crucial challenges make increased activity and
regional consensus the overriding success criteria. In this light, it
may be beneficial if State Secretary Marco Rubio is not at the table.

#### Greenland, Ukraine, and development disputes all doom solvency

The Kingdom of Denmark, comprising Greenland, the Faroe Islands and
Denmark, recently presented the program for its upcoming chairship of
the Arctic Council. The realm, with Greenland in the driver\'s seat,
takes the wheel in the council on May 12th. The program outlines four
main priorities: Indigenous peoples and communities of the Arctic,
sustainable economic development and energy transition solutions,
oceans, climate change, and biodiversity. \"The program appears
well-developed and has clear priorities. There is an expected and
necessary focus on Indigenous peoples and those who actually live in the
Arctic,\" says Serafima Andreeva, Researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen
Institute, to High North News. \"Its content is also in line with the
shift we have seen for a while now, that the main focus is no longer on
the Arctic Council\'s survival, but on its functioning in practice.\"
Constants and variables The Kingdom of Denmark has clearly designed the
plan for its chairship within an established, agreed-upon framework,
with a natural and expected distinctive character, according to the FNI
researcher. \"The program follows up on the council\'s strategic plan,
adopted in 2021, and the priorities are in line with what all eight
Arctic states have previously agreed on. At the same time, the program
is characterized by the realm\'s, and particularly Greenland\'s,
priorities and interests when looking at the local level.\" Therefore,
there is reason to believe that the chairship program will serve as a
basis for a functioning cooperation between all Arctic states, but
certain reservations must be made, according to Andreeva. "I believe the
US can become more unpredictable on climate issues in the Arctic Council
than Russia,\" she points out. Contrasts \"[[The relationship between
the Western Arctic states and Russia has been strained following the
Ukraine War]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite this, Moscow has acted
predictably in the Arctic Council. The Russians have been clear that
they will participate as long as their national interests are
safeguarded, and that there are no excessive restrictions on their
involvement,\" Andreeva notes and continues: \"[[The US,]{.mark}
however, particularly with Trump 2.0, [will be more challenging to
read]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Kingdom of [**[Denmark prioritizes
climate, Indigenous peoples, and sustainable development, which are
values in direct contrast to Trump\'s policy]{.mark}**. It is difficult
to envision the Trump administration being particularly enthusiastic
when it comes to topics like these]{.underline}.\" At the Arctic
Council\'s ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi in 2019, no joint statement
was issued because the US\' then-Trump administration would not support
a text addressing climate change. USA vis-à-vis Greenland \"At the same
time, the US has increased interest in Greenland, and the Arctic Council
is an arena where communication between Greenland and the US is
possible. Yet, if the Americans were to think of \'using\' the Arctic
Council as an arena of influence, they would still have to comply with
the Council\'s fundamental norms, which include that climate change and
Indigenous rights are important.\" President Donald [[Trump has
specifically expressed an ambition for American control over Greenland
through annexation]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which has been met with
strong and firm counter reactions from Nuuk and
Copenhagen]{.underline}]{.mark}. He and his ministers will probably also
encounter considerable steadfastness from the Greenlandic side in the
Arctic Council when it comes to climate work, the FNI researcher
believes. He and his ministers will likely also face steadfastness from
the Greenlandic side in the Arctic Council regarding work on addressing
climate change and its impacts, believes the FNI researcher. \"It will
likely be more difficult for the Trump administration to appeal to
Greenlanders when the new chairship program is so clear on addressing
the climate crisis based on Indigenous perspectives and needs. These
principles are in themselves a direct contrast to the policy Trump
represents,\" she points out.
