# Russian Emboldenment DA

## Notes 

#### There are two versions of the DA. I think they are both equally viable strategies against any AFF that doesn't specifically antagonize Russia. It obviously works best against any cooperation-based affirmatives, but I think that you can make a convincing link story for many Affirmatives. The two versions cannot be run together. 

#### The core of both versions rests on the idea that Putin is going to use the plan as leverage with Trump. Trump sees this as an opportunity to say he ended the war and takes a bad deal. This allows Putin to continue his aggression in Ukraine and elsewhere, causing a litany of terrible things. 

#### The Ukraine version of the DA utilizes the specificity of the Komin and Hosa evidence to its benefit. By explicitly linking Arctic cooperation and the Ukrainian conflict, Putin can turn the tide decisively in his favor. That causes a bad outcome for Ukraine and subsequently the world through a combination of increased Russian and Chinese expansionism and aggression as well as rapid, widespread proliferation causing a nuclear war. There are other impact mods, such as the use of nuclear weapons by Russia in Ukraine and/or nuclear accidents causing unintended escalation. There is also a democracy mod that has some really solid evidence. Once again, the strength of the Ukraine DA is the specificity of the evidence. 

#### The cooperation version of the DA is fantastic option. The Komin and Hosa link evidence does make the claim that Putin could use the Arctic as a bargaining chip in other parts of their geopolitical strategy. This gives you lots of inroads into Russian adventurism/aggression impacts that aren't explicitly tied to the outcome of the Ukrainian conflict. This allows you to sidestep uniqueness questions about Trump's commitment to Ukraine as well as the overall outcome of the war. This could definitely be beneficial if you want to keep the debate simple. 

#### Each of the versions is self-contained under their own F4 Pocket. This is most important to keep in mind for the impact scenarios, because they are just different enough to cause confusion if you pull from the wrong section.

#### Despite Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine, the war is at a stalemate with no end in sight. However, Trump risks appeasing Putin and emboldening him

[Ever since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald
[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} in January, [the world [has been hypnotized
by the prospect of a cease-fire in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is
easy to see why. [The election of an American president who wanted to
act as a Ukraine broker rather than a Ukraine backer was seen as an
opportunity to disrupt the status quo and stop the
bloodshed.]{.underline} But [effective wartime diplomacy requires
applying the right amount of leverage---sticks and carrots---on the
right parties, under time pressure]{.underline}. Trump introduced the
final factor by promising a swift outcome, and when that proved
impossible, unsuccessfully threatening to walk away from negotiations
altogether. But [he failed when it came to rewards and punishments,
wielding all the sticks against the country that was attacked while
reserving all the carrots for the attacker.]{.underline} He railed
against Ukraine, blaming it for the war, and at one point suspended
assistance to its military. Meanwhile, he praised Russian President
Vladimir Putin. As a result, [[the world is no closer to meaningful
negotiations now than]{.mark} it was [when Trump won]{.mark} the U.S.
presidential election in November]{.underline}. [Countries have heard
and seen a lot---Moscow's pro-Trump messaging, Kyiv's embrace of talks,
Europe's American outreach, and all the shuttle diplomacy. But these
were less bridges to peace than attempts to flatter the U.S. president:
the goal was not to end the war, but to bring Trump closer to one side
and prevent him from sliding to the other.]{.underline} Trump's quest,
however, was always going to be difficult. [The stark reality is that
[neither Russia nor Ukraine has much of an incentive to stop the
fighting. Moscow has built a wartime economy that allows it to keep
fighting]{.mark}---and makes it hard to stop doing so. [Ukraine is in no
mood to compromise]{.mark} on its sovereignty, and its military remains
strong enough to keep mounting an effective defense. As a result, [for
now, a cease-fire]{.mark} in Ukraine [is
impossible]{.mark}.]{.underline} NO TRUMP CARD Ukraine's friends in the
West have long been divided in their assessment of what Russia wants.
According to some, Putin is pursuing a limited agenda and would settle
for limited gains. By this logic, the Kremlin might be sated, for
example, by a deal that accepts that the occupied parts of Ukraine are
rightfully Russian and guarantees that Ukraine will not join NATO.
Others strenuously disagree. In their view, [[appeasing Putin will only
encourage him]{.mark}. The Russian president came for all of Ukraine,
whose very statehood is irreconcilable with his vision of his role in
history.]{.underline} This group reinforces its position by citing
Putin's prewar treatise, "On the Historical Unity of Russians and
Ukrainians," in which he argued that Ukrainians are not a separate
nationality but wayward Russians who must be brought back under Moscow's
suzerainty. [In his musings about peace talks, the Russian leader has
also repeatedly said that any settlement must address the "root causes
of the conflict"---that is, erase Ukrainian sovereignty.]{.underline}
Some Western policymakers understand this but argue that the longer the
war drags on, the weaker Ukraine's position will become and the more
likely it is that it will have to eventually yield. Better, then, to
accept a bad deal now than a worse one later. Trump himself appears to
subscribe to this. "You don't have the cards," he told Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky in February. [This line of thinking may
sound rational. But it misreads Ukraine's hand. Kyiv could certainly
hold better cards, but the country is not so desperate that it must fold
now]{.underline}. Ukraine is counting on Europe to shield it from
potentially dramatic changes in the war's course resulting from waning
U.S. military support. Ukraine also knows that the situation on the
frontlines is not as dire as many suggest. In December 2023, Russia
controlled approximately 42,000 square miles of Ukrainian territory. In
December 2024, that figure had grown only slightly, to around 43,600
square miles. In the time since, Russia's holdings have remained
effectively flat. As of late May, Russia held approximately 43,650
square miles of Ukrainian land. Analysts paying close attention to the
news have read reports of the Russian army's taking one square mile and
village after another. But zoom out a bit, and the country supposedly
holding all the cards has gained just 1,650 of Ukraine's 233,030 square
miles over the last 16 months. Put differently, [Moscow has gone from
occupying about 18 percent of Ukrainian territory in late 2023 to
roughly 19 percent today. [Kyiv]{.mark} thus [believes it has time to
strengthen its position, both diplomatically and on the
battlefield.]{.mark}]{.underline} There are, of course, [factors beyond
Russia's territorial advances that could change Ukraine's
calculus]{.underline}---including a credible shift by Moscow to more
limited goals. Kyiv might also budge if Europe fails to deliver weapons
to compensate for the lack of U.S. deliveries and if Ukraine's air
defenses collapse without supplies of American-made PAC-3 interceptors.
(Such missiles are perhaps Trump's biggest source of leverage.) Kyiv
might begin to contemplate concessions if its civilian infrastructure is
damaged further. Putin is aware of this, which is why he is sending more
barrages of drones and missiles than ever before. But [as of now,
Ukraine's air defenses are holding up. Europe is announcing new military
assistance to Ukraine while investing more in defense production on the
continent]{.underline}. Although the Russian army is not making dramatic
breakthroughs, [[Putin has given no indication that he is moving away
from absolutist aims. It is therefore impossible for Trump---or anyone
else---to push Ukraine into making an unfavorable deal that it does not
think Russia will honor]{.mark}.]{.underline} SECOND FRONT Trump's
failures with Ukraine, however, hardly mean that his Russia policy won't
be consequential for security. The president's embrace of Moscow and
corresponding pivot away from Europe is pushing the continent to become
more independent and leaving its people far more exposed. European
countries are working to develop more powerful militaries and a better
defense industrial base, but not fast enough to meet their own needs or
those of Ukraine. Trump has said that he will not withdraw from NATO.
But given his open hostility to Europe and history of withdrawing the
United States from foreign wars, it is hard to imagine that American
troops will be dying for Europe. This combination of factors makes it
tempting for Putin to attack a NATO ally in Europe. Unlike in Ukraine,
his initial goal would not be to subjugate the country but simply to
expose Europe's weakness and the falsehood of NATO's commitment to
collective security. But the following few years could be his best shot
at actually seizing a piece of NATO territory before Europe effectively
fills its defense gaps and before Trump is replaced with a U.S.
president who cares about the continent. Moscow is capable of opening a
new front while still battling Kyiv. It has conducted a buildup along
Russia's borders with Finland and Norway that resembles the one it
established along Ukraine's border in the spring of 2021. It has become
increasingly aggressive in the Baltic Sea. It recently announced
large-scale exercises with Belarus. [Putin has proved willing to make
his people endure hardships on a scale unimaginable for most nations in
pursuit of his military objectives.]{.underline} He has a tight
relationship with China, whereas Ukraine's camp is plagued with opposing
reading of Russia's end goals. And he is running a war economy. Putin,
then, may be preparing to fight simultaneous wars of different scales.
Europe has imposed a suite of sanctions against Moscow, which are
politically and financially valuable, in order to deter Russian
aggression. But no matter how pleased the European Union may be with
each new restriction, the EU cannot \<dismantle\>~~cripple~~ the Russian
war machine by itself. It is encouraging that the bloc is intensifying
its crackdown on the shadow tanker fleet Russia is using to evade
sanctions, but that won't depress Russian oil prices enough to make a
major difference. Putin might begin to change his mind about fighting on
if he sees a sustained collapse in the price of Russian oil, which would
rob his war economy of financial resources. Yet effecting such a
collapse requires active involvement by the United States, which holds
leverage over the global market. Washington would need to impose stiffer
sanctions on Russia's oil industry and persuade Saudi Arabia, one of the
world's biggest suppliers, and India, one of the largest consumers of
Russian oil, to join its effort. Such a coalition would then need to get
China not to interfere, in part by making clear that its goal is the end
of the war, not the end of Russia. Riyadh seems to be best positioned to
try to do this, given its close relationship with both China and the
United States. But these steps are all highly unlikely. Trump has
harshened his tone toward Putin but given no indication that he is ready
to take strong action against him. India and Saudi Arabia, meanwhile,
have no appetite to act against the Kremlin on this scale. [This plainly
means that Putin will continue earning enough from the oil trade to fund
a war effort---and perhaps not just in Ukraine.]{.underline} The era of
peace in Europe thus appears to be over. [The war in Ukraine is much
more likely to continue than it is to stop. Putin has no reason to let
up, and Zelensky has no reason to give in:]{.underline} the Ukrainian
president believes that conceding part of Ukraine now would eventually
lead Kyiv to lose all of it. For him, under these circumstances, [the
cease-fire at the end of the tunnel is the light of an oncoming
train.]{.underline} [Nothing but death is predetermined]{.underline}.
Trump and others have the power to change their opinions and tactics.
But the best Europeans can do now is accelerate their efforts to arm
Kyiv---and themselves.

[[The Kremlin]{.mark}'s foreign policy in the Arctic walks a clumsy
tightrope]{.underline}. It uses international law when convenient,
courts China and India as symbolic partners, and flirts with building
"alternative" institutions, all while fearing Beijing and [quietly
hoping for the West to resume cooperation]{.underline}. Unlike its more
coherent economic and military Arctic strategies, [its [diplomatic
approach is piecemeal and opportunistic]{.mark}---less a roadmap and
more a toolkit for tactical improvisation.]{.underline} Still, it serves
a purpose: to keep the door ajar for reintegration into international
cooperation on the Arctic, while building leverage to demand it on
Moscow's terms. At the same time, its ambiguity on issues such as China
allows Russia to remain open to unexpected opportunities for a full
reset of Arctic geopolitics. [[Should negotiations with the US succeed
Russia could leverage a commitment to reducing its (exaggerated)
cooperation with China and India, for example, for tangible gains
elsewhere---most notably in Ukraine.]{.mark}]{.underline} How Europe can
freeze Russia's ambitions [Despite the pressure of international
sanctions and the war in Ukraine, [Russia has not abandoned its Arctic
ambitions]{.mark}.]{.underline} On the contrary, [the Kremlin has made
the region a geopolitical priority]{.underline}. As this paper has laid
out, it is directing significant political attention and financial
resources to Arctic development that will yield results in years to
come. [Even if these efforts remain plagued by structural
inefficiencies, corruption, intra-elite rivalries and the inherent
difficulties of operating in extreme climates, they will nonetheless
expand Russia's presence and capabilities in ways that directly threaten
Western security interests. Russia's Arctic posture under
Patrushev]{.underline}, [combined with America's assertiveness, may
create a new theatre of competition]{.underline} in a region where
Europe risks being sidelined or worse, caught in the middle. To avoid
being squeezed between two more aggressive actors, Europe's Arctic
states cannot afford to go it alone. Rather they must work together with
the EU and other member states to anticipate this shift and develop
contingency strategies now. This should include strengthening
cooperation with like-minded Arctic and non-Arctic states and situating
the Kremlin's approach within its wider geopolitical strategy, most
notably in Ukraine. Strengthen cooperation with like-minded Arctic
states The EU and European governments should pursue greater
collaboration with Canada---a close ally that shares European interests
in sustainability and rules-based governance. Such collaboration could
be especially useful in reinforcing Europeans' voice and agency in
Arctic diplomacy. To make this new cooperation more impactful, the EU
and its member states should broaden their traditional agenda with
Ottawa beyond climate and Indigenous issues to include more defence
policy. The new Canadian government which is more focused on Europe
provides strong momentum. One way to deepen collaboration would be for
the members of Nordic Defence Cooperation (NORDEFCO)---a framework that
currently includes Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden---to
push for Canada's partial inclusion. Or, at minimum, they could develop
structured defence dialogues with Ottawa focused on northern security,
including more frequent joint patrols of Arctic waters. Europeans should
also consider publicly backing Canada's legal position in its shelf
demarcation dispute with America, following Washington's unilateral
claim in 2023. A coordinated EU--Canada approach could prevent both
sides being sidelined in the event of a US--Russia potential deal over
the region's future. Such a deal might see Washington and Moscow renew
trade cooperation in the Arctic and support each other's non-conflicting
claims to the Arctic shelf, which would ignore both European and
Canadian interests. In this context, EU member states should deepen
defence cooperation with Greenland and Iceland, focusing on Arctic
security through frameworks like NORDEFCO, rather than relying solely on
NATO, whose cohesion is increasingly uncertain. Moreover, countries in
the GIUK gap (Greenland, Iceland and the United Kingdom) together with
EU partners should strengthen their joint capabilities, especially
because the corridor is used for detecting Russian naval and submarine
movements, and monitoring undersea infrastructure. To do so, a portion
of the EU's proposed €800bn defence package should be earmarked for
Arctic-specific initiatives, including infrastructure and surveillance
systems. Enhanced European engagement in the GIUK gap might also entice
the US as the area serves as a critical buffer against Russian maritime
activity. Maintain limited and structured engagement with Russia in the
Arctic Council Despite the rupture in relations following Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including the near collapse of the
Arctic Council, it remains in Europeans' interest to preserve a
functional channel of communication with Russia through the council to
help prevent its withdrawal. With the Kingdom of Denmark taking over the
chairship in May 2025, it should aim to replicate Norway's cautious
strategy: keeping Russia engaged in selected formats without full
normalisation until the war in Ukraine is over. And, given Moscow's
appointment of Nikolai Korchunov as its ambassador in Oslo, Norway is
well placed to play an intermediary role between Russia and Europe on
Arctic policy. More importantly, some engagement with Russia in the
Arctic Council may dissuade [[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} from
[[establishing a parallel bilateral Arctic track with Moscow or allowing
a temporary US-Russia thaw under Trump to take institutional
form]{.underline}]{.mark}. If such a channel materialised, it [[could
strengthen Moscow's efforts to]{.mark} build a real "Polar Council" that
includes non-Western states and the US and excludes European countries
and Canada, turning a Potemkin construct into a viable
alternative]{.underline}. Such a deal---driven by the imperial ambitions
of both Washington and Moscow---would further erode Europe's influence
in the region and undermine the cohesion of Western Arctic strategy.
Counterbalance Sino-Russian posturing by engaging non-Arctic states
Although Russia frequently showcases its alignment with China on Arctic
issues, the cooperation is shallow and hampered by deep strategic
mistrust. Russia treats the Arctic as a national-security-dominated
space and offers China only tightly controlled access to projects. In
contrast, Beijing seeks a more open framework aligned with its own
Arctic interests of economic dominance and expanded global influence. To
avoid being boxed in, Moscow is now deliberately courting India as a
balancing partner. Europeans should do the same, using their developing
cooperation with India, both at the EU level and through the effective
bilateral relations between Delhi and Paris and Delhi and Berlin. These
efforts should focus on expanding cooperation with India in scientific
research, Arctic logistics and green development could serve as a
strategic hedge against Chinese and Russian ambitions and help stabilise
the emerging multipolar Arctic order. The European Commission and EU
member states should also build stronger ties with other Indo-Pacific
actors, particularly Japan and South Korea. These countries have
advanced capabilities in Arctic science, shipping and climate
resilience, which makes them valuable partners in safeguarding a
rules-based Arctic governance model. [[Understand the Arctic as a
bargaining chip]{.mark} in the Kremlin's wider geopolitical strategy
Moscow is [increasingly linking its Arctic diplomacy to its broader
war-and-peace calculus on Ukraine. Early signs of US attempts to broker
a political resolution to the war have reignited the Kremlin's hopes for
a "grand bargain", in which symbolic Arctic concessions---such
as]{.mark}]{.underline} downplaying Chinese involvement or [[reengaging
with Western formats]{.mark}---[could be exchanged for more substantive
gains in Ukraine]{.mark} and beyond.]{.underline} Europeans must be
ready for this tactic and avoid mistaking performative gestures for real
policy shifts. In particular, [[the Kremlin is likely to
court]{.underline}]{.mark} Western---especially [[American---interest in
selective Arctic cooperation]{.mark}, using promises of investment
access to seek sanctions relief.]{.underline} Even if Washington
engages, European leaders should remain firm and sceptical of such
overtures and [remind Trump that illusions of Russia's flexibility in
the Arctic could be used to obscure continued intransigence
elsewhere.]{.underline} Even though Europeans have so far had little say
in the Ukraine negotiation process compared to the US, they still hold
some sway in their own right. Europeans should use this to distinguish
between genuine strategic threats and the Kremlin's performative signals
intended to pressure the West into restoring cooperation. Despite its
rhetoric, [Russia is unlikely to withdraw from multilateral Arctic
frameworks or abandon UNCLOS mechanisms---particularly its shelf
extension claims---unless Western countries move to politicise these
processes, for example by stalling Russia's submissions due to
sanctions.]{.underline} Moscow's underlying objective is likely to
restore pre-2022 formats of Arctic cooperation, particularly within the
Arctic Council, and thus rehabilitate its international standing without
altering its behaviour in Ukraine. Europeans must therefore be clear
that no return to "business as usual" in Arctic governance is acceptable
without a ceasefire or durable settlement to the conflict. On thin ice
[[The Kremlin is investing heavily in the Arctic and will]{.mark}
continue to do so]{.underline}. In the dreams of [Russia's
leaders]{.underline}, they [will [sit down with]{.mark}]{.underline} the
West---mostly with [[the US]{.mark}---and renegotiate the world order in
their favour. They will likely try [to sell illusory concessions in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, among others, [[while sacrificing nothing
of principle in order to gain in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. Europeans
must not underestimate Russia's continued military build-up in the
Arctic, which---despite pressures elsewhere---remains a long-term
Kremlin priority. Instead, they must track these developments and
prepare a coherent NATO-based response, independent of shifting US
leadership and Moscow's thin veil of concessions.

Ever since Donald Trump's November 2024 election victory, speculation
has been mounting over a potential peace deal to end the Russian
invasion of Ukraine. With Russian forces currently enjoying the
battlefield initiative and amid doubts over continued US support for
Kyiv, [many observers believe Ukraine may have little choice but to
accept highly unfavorable peace terms dictated by the Kremlin. Russia's
conditions would likely include the loss of territory along with
wholesale disarmament and the imposition of permanent neutral status.
The implications of such a shameful peace for Ukrainian statehood would
be catastrophic]{.underline}. Nor would the damage be contained within
Ukraine's violated borders. On the contrary, [[the consequences of
abandoning Ukraine]{.mark} would reverberate around the world for many
years to come, [undermining the foundations of international
security]{.mark}.]{.underline} If it happens, the fall of Ukraine may
not be immediately apparent. Indeed, it could even be temporarily
disguised by face-saving talk of pragmatism and compromise. However, a
demilitarized, partitioned, and internationally isolated postwar Ukraine
without credible security guarantees [would have little chance of
surviving]{.underline} for long. Behind the diplomatic platitudes, it
would be painfully obvious that [[Ukraine]{.mark} was now completely [at
Putin's mercy]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such circumstances, a new Russian
invasion would be merely a matter of time. [[The spirit of the 1938
Munich Agreement l]{.mark}ooms large over prospective US-brokered peace
talks between Russia and Ukraine. With pressure mounting on Ukraine to
make concessions to the aggressor]{.underline}, it is hardly surprising
that [many are comparing the current situation to the ugly deal between
Western leaders and Nazi Germany that sealed the fate of Czechoslovakia
and [paved the war for World War II]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Just
as British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain returned from Munich
brandishing Hitler's worthless signature and declaring "peace for our
time," critics now fear that similar efforts to appease Putin will set
the stage for further Russian aggression. [Ukraine's demise as an
independent state would confirm the failure of the existing
international security architecture.]{.underline} In its place, [[we
would enter a new era of international affairs dominated by a handful of
Great Powers seeking to establish their own spheres of
influence]{.underline},]{.mark} with smaller countries reduced to the
role of buffer states. A climate of insecurity would initially take root
from the Baltic to the Balkans, and would soon spread to the wider
world. [The collapse of the rules-based international order]{.underline}
would inevitably undermine the credibility of the West. Meanwhile,
authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea would
be significantly strengthened. [[Moscow would]{.mark} almost certainly
escalate its ongoing hybrid war against the democratic world, and may
[seek further territorial gains]{.mark} in Central Asia, the Caucasus,
or Eastern Europe]{.underline}. [Autocrats in [Beijing]{.mark}, Tehran,
and beyond [would draw the logical conclusions from Putin's
victory]{.mark} in Ukraine [and embrace expansionist foreign
policies]{.mark} of their own.]{.underline} With the sanctity of
international borders no longer assured, [countries around the world
would [scramble to rearm]{.mark}]{.underline}. Crucially,
[[Russia's]{.mark} successful use of [nuclear blackmail against Ukraine
would convince many nations to acquire nuclear weapons of their
own]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This would lead to [a nuclear arms race that
would rapidly escalate]{.mark}, undoing decades of non-proliferation
efforts. With dozens of countries aspiring to nuclear status, the
[chances of a nuclear war would rise dramatically]{.mark}, as would the
potential for nukes to fall into the hands of rogue actors.]{.underline}
Today's international security crisis did not arise overnight. The
security climate has been steadily deteriorating since 2014, when Russia
first seized the Crimean peninsula and invaded eastern Ukraine's Donbas
region. The inadequate international response to these watershed acts of
Russian aggression was interpreted in Moscow as a green light to go
further, creating the conditions for the full-scale invasion of 2022 and
setting the stage for what has become the largest European war since
World War II. [[If Western leaders now choose to sacrifice Ukraine in a
misguided bid to placate Putin, the shift]{.mark} from a rules-based
international order to the law of the geopolitical jungle [will be
complete]{.mark}. This transition will be extremely expensive, with
countries around the world forced to dramatically increase defense
budgets to levels that dwarf the current cost of military support for
Ukraine.]{.underline} None of this is inevitable, of course. [It is
still entirely possible to secure a just peace for Ukraine that would
deter the Russia-led axis of autocrats and revive faith in a rules-based
system of international relations]{.underline}. However, this would
require a degree of resolve and political will that few Western leaders
have been prepared to demonstrate since the onset of Russia's full-scale
invasion in 2022. For almost three years, the Western response has been
marked by excessive caution and a crippling fear of escalation that have
only served to embolden the Kremlin. Putin is clearly counting on
continued Western weakness as he looks to break Ukrainian resistance in
a grinding war of attrition. He is now more confident than ever of
victory and has little interest in negotiating anything other than the
terms of Ukraine's surrender. This is the unfavorable reality that will
confront Donald Trump when he returns to the White House later this
month. Unless he and other Western leaders insist on pursuing peace
through strength, Ukraine will have little chance of survival and the
wider world will face a Hobbesian future of instability and aggression.

### 2NC -- Timing Key

#### Now is a key time for the Ukraine war. Continued Ukrainian opposition is the only way to properly stand up to Putin. The longer they hold out the more likely that Putin actually talks cease-fire

[If the war in Ukraine is going to end through
negotiations]{.underline}, therefore, [[Putin will need to be convinced
not only that his political objectives are unrealistic but also that a
failure to reach a deal will result in Russia's position worsening over
time]{.underline}.]{.mark} At present, that is far from clear. What
might make the difference? [Moscow must be concerned by the increasing
tempo of Ukrainian attacks against an array of military and economic
targets on Russian territory]{.underline}. The most spectacular---such
as the early June Operation Spider's Web, using low-tech, short-range
drones to destroy more than a dozen Russian strategic bombers at air
bases far from the border---were a testament to Ukrainian audacity,
operational ingenuity, and technical prowess. [Such strikes are
embarrassing and disruptive to Russia but still unlikely by themselves
to force Moscow to reappraise its war strategy]{.underline}. They also
have not fundamentally changed the basic dynamics on the frontlines,
although attacks on logistic hubs, arms depots, and command centers
certainly help. Since early in the war, analysts have attempted to work
out at what point one side or the other would run out of vital
supplies---armored vehicles, artillery pieces, shells, missiles, air
defenses, and so on. In some areas, stocks have been seriously depleted.
Ammunition is currently less of a problem for Ukraine, but its air
defenses are a significant concern. [[Russia now appears to lack the
capacity for maneuver warfare]{.mark}. Yet both sides keep going with
help from their friends, and they have relied increasingly on
capabilities, notably drones, when domestic mass production is possible
and relatively affordable so that expendability is far less of a
worry.]{.underline} Moscow will need to be convinced that its objectives
in Ukraine are unrealistic. [[The most perplexing issue is
manpower]{.underline}]{.mark}. This has been and remains a serious
matter for Ukraine. Although numbers are now up (Zelensky claims to be
mobilizing 27,000 a month), there is still resistance in Kyiv to
conscripting 18-to-24-year-olds. On the Russian side, [Moscow accepts
heavy casualties for small gains and continues to find troops to send to
the front despite the high risk of death and injury. Several Western
analyses have concluded that the war has already cost Russia a million
casualties. Russia appears to have a Soviet-style
readiness]{.underline}, which arguably goes back to imperial times, to
throw troops at enemy defenses in the hope that some will get through.
Current Russian strategy, for example, relies on small groups of troops
on buggies, bikes, and foot advancing in the knowledge that most will
not reach Ukrainian lines but that enough might to occupy some new
ground. Thus far, the Kremlin has found troops without resorting to a
full-scale mobilization. This is because of a bounty system that uses
hefty---and ever-increasing---payments to recruits. Since recruits
largely come from the poorer parts of the country, the war also has a
redistributive effect[. Russia's war machine is a bit like an extractive
industry, in which as long as there is material that can be mined, it is
good business. Still, in the end, the supplies will be
limited]{.underline}. There are already doubts about how much more
manpower the state can buy and at what price. The question remains
whether at some point the Kremlin will have to resort to more coercive
methods. [This cost relates to Putin's wider problem of [whether the
Russian economy can continue to sustain this level of military
effort]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moscow has confounded Western expectations
that severe sanctions would wreck the country's economy and has instead
enjoyed a couple of years of high growth. This is the result of a
combination of shrewd macroeconomic management, high energy prices, the
support of China and other Russian energy clients in circumventing
sanctions, and the war boom triggered by enormous defense production.
But [[beginning in late 2024, there were signs that Russia's militarized
economy was beginning to severely overheat]{.mark}, with labor
shortages, high inflation, and high interest rates discouraging
investment]{.underline}. For the first months of 2025, the Trump-induced
downturn in international trade pushed down oil prices, putting further
pressure on Russian coffers. BEYOND DEADLOCK Ukraine began 2023 hoping
that it could win the war with a counteroffensive. When that failed, and
with the U.S. Congress refusing to vote for more assistance to Kyiv,
Russia was optimistic that it would be able to pull ahead in 2024.
Moscow now insists that it can prevail over the long haul. It certainly
does not want its enemy to think otherwise. [[Putin]{.mark} likely still
thinks that Ukraine will buckle first, but he [has always underestimated
Ukraine's resilience and determination. Perhaps a tipping point will
come when Moscow begins to recognize the utter futility of this
war]{.mark} and the long-term economic damage to Russia starts to
outweigh the costs of acknowledging that the war's political objective
cannot be met. Maybe [some future Ukrainian operation will trigger the
necessary reappraisal]{.mark}.]{.underline} The experience of this war,
however, underlines the difficulty of getting political leaders to
acknowledge failure when their forces have yet to be defeated in the
field and when there is no obvious compromise deal waiting to be
negotiated. [[Neither side has a clear-cut route to victory]{.mark}.
That is what it means to be in a forever war. It is not evident how it
will end, or even if an apparent peace will be no more than an
opportunity for Russia to rebuild its forces under the guise of an
uneasy cease-fire. This will depend on decisions yet to be
made]{.underline}. Ukraine's Western allies, therefore, must be
realistic about the potentially long-term demands entailed in keeping
Ukraine in the war. **[[Continuing to deny Russia victory is a form of
pressure on Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who has so little to show for
such a long and calamitous campaign. Although it may be hard to imagine
a military defeat for Russia, [[it is possible to imagine a shift in
Ukraine's favor. If Moscow becomes convinced]{.mark}, contrary to its
current expectations, [that time is not on its side, perhaps that might
yet cause it to wonder whether the moment has come to cut its
losses.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC -- A2: Russia Win Inevitable 

#### Ukraine is not lost, impressive Ukrainian victories mean they can still have meaningful progress against Russia

**Carpenter 2025**. Michael Carpenter is a Distinguished Fellow at the
Atlantic Council. "Ukraine Can Still Win" Foreign Affairs July 1, 2025.

When U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, many in
Washington expected a rapid settlement to the war in Ukraine. On the
campaign trail, Trump had boasted he could end the conflict in 24 hours.
Although few analysts believed that specific promise, many speculated
about the possible terms and timeline of an impending deal. The
investment bank JPMorgan Chase, for example, claimed an agreement could
be reached by June. Yet [as the weeks pass and diplomacy stagnates, it
is becoming clear that no such [resolution is
imminent]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Ukraine's former Foreign Minister
Dmytro Kuleba noted in Foreign Affairs in late May, [[neither Russia nor
Ukraine "has much of an incentive to stop the fighting." Ukraine refuses
to surrender]{.mark} its sovereignty; [Russia will not accept anything
less]{.mark} than Ukrainian capitulation.]{.underline} This conclusion,
however, does not mean all is lost. [[Russia is much weaker
economically]{.underline}]{.mark} than many analysts realize, and
[[hard-hitting sanctions and export controls can still
\<dismantle\>]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~cripple~~ [[its]{.mark} war
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Ukraine is fighting smartly and could
turn the tide on the battlefield with more]{.underline}]{.mark} high-end
drones, air defense systems, long-range missiles, and munitions. With a
change of strategy, Ukraine can still win the war in the near term---if
both Europe and the United States decide to give it the assistance it
needs. THE DOSE MAKES THE POISON Much of the premature optimism about a
settlement earlier this year sprang from the prevailing belief that
Ukraine was losing and would soon be forced to negotiate out of
desperation. Trump stoked this narrative by asserting that Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky had "no cards" left to play. U.S. Vice
President JD Vance took it a step further, declaring that Ukraine---and
its foreign backers---never had any "pathway to victory." Citing
Russia's superiority in manpower and weapons, Vance argued that if the
United States kept up its security assistance, it would only postpone
Ukraine's inevitable defeat. This defeatism has been supported by a
second, equally pernicious assumption: that Russian President Vladimir
Putin's commitment to subjugating Ukraine cannot be deterred. The former
CIA analyst Peter Schroeder's assessment in Foreign Affairs last
September exemplifies this view, describing Putin as "all
in"---personally invested in keeping Ukraine from becoming a European
democracy, no matter the cost. Such a narrative holds a kernel of truth,
but it also dovetails too neatly with Russian propaganda. By assigning
no agency to Ukraine or its foreign partners, it presumes that Ukrainian
victory is a fantasy born of Western delusion, and it is a view that
risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Both assumptions, meanwhile,
rest on an excessively narrow reading of battlefield dynamics and a
limited understanding of the policy options available to Ukraine's
backers. Despite significant constraints on the aid that Europe and the
United States have offered over the past three and a half years,
[Ukraine has achieved [impressive
victories]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It repelled Russia's initial
push toward Kyiv in March 2022 with little more than shoulder-fired
antitank missiles and grit, defying the predictions of many military
analysts. Later that year, in a stunning rout for Russian forces,
Ukraine reclaimed nearly a thousand square miles in the Kharkiv region
without the benefit of modern armor or air cover. And just weeks ago,
[Ukraine shocked the world by pulling off Operation Spiderweb, a
surprise attack that used cheap, remote-controlled drones to inflict
substantial damage on Russia's long-range aviation.]{.underline}

THEY TALKED by phone for over two hours, but Vladimir [Putin left Donald
Trump with almost nothing to show for it---a slap in the face that only
a man possessed of unbounded chutzpah could pretend was a
win.]{.underline} A week earlier, negotiators for America and Ukraine
had agreed on a 30-day ceasefire in a conflict that has lasted for over
three years. Mr Trump had said that if Russia did not sign up he might
hit it with tough new sanctions. In the event, he rolled over. Even
Boris Johnson, a former British prime minister who admires Mr Trump,
declared that [[Putin is "laughing at us]{.mark}".]{.underline} Instead
of an unconditional ceasefire, Mr Putin proposed only that both sides
stop striking each other's energy infrastructure, an area where Ukraine
has been landing some weighty blows on the invader. For anything further
to happen, says the Russian government, Ukraine must accept a freeze on
foreign military aid and an end to conscription and training, although
Russia proposes no such restrictions on itself. Mr [[Putin]{.mark} also
[wants]{.mark} a solution to the "root causes" of the conflict, by which
he really means [an end to]{.mark} the existence of [Ukraine]{.mark} as
an independent country. Those are [not]{.mark} the words of [a
man]{.mark} who is [eager to compromise]{.mark}.]{.underline} Optimists
can extract a little comfort. A pause on attacks on energy targets,
agreed on in a call with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, is a
small advance. Mr Trump also suggested that nuclear power stations come
under American ownership, for their protection, and said he would try to
source some Patriot missiles from Europe. In public he has refrained
from endorsing Mr Putin's harsher demands for Ukraine. The real danger
lies ahead. Mr [[Putin wants the American president to believe
that]{.mark}, as statesmen, [they have bigger fish to fry than]{.mark}
squabbling over a forlorn place like [Ukraine]{.mark}. So long as it
does not get in the way, [Russia and America can accomplish almost
anything together]{.mark}. Russia could help resolve crises]{.underline}
in the Middle East [and]{.underline} beyond, perhaps leaning on its
friend Iran to forgo the bomb. [American investment]{.underline} in
Russian businesses, such as exploring for gas [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, could steam ahead. Sanctions would be
lifted and Russia could rejoin the G7. Imagine if Russia were detached
from its "no-limits partnership" with China. "World war three", an
abiding worry of Mr Trump's, would have been averted. [All this is [a
fantasy designed to tempt]{.mark} Mr [Trump into giving]{.mark} Mr
[Putin what he wants in Ukraine]{.mark} in return for empty
promises]{.underline}. The reality is that Russia now depends more on
China than it ever will on America, and will not be separated from it.
Russia's leverage over Iran is limited. Russia's economy is smaller than
Italy's and subject to a despot's whims, so business opportunities are
slim.

The [[Trump]{.mark} administration [has changed America's
strategy]{.mark} and objectives in the war [in Ukraine]{.mark}. The US
is [no longer after "victory]{.mark}" as defined by the Biden
administration or Ukraine. It is uninterested in preserving Ukrainian
territorial integrity or deterring aggression. It does not believe that
Russian gains in Ukraine will embolden the Russian president, Vladimir
Putin, to threaten NATO in Europe. They view these topics as European
and Ukrainian concerns, which have little to do with "making America
great again."]{.underline} But the [Trump administration nonetheless has
important goals in these negotiations. [They want to be able to claim
they]{.mark} brought peace to Ukraine, or at the very least, [ended
American involvement]{.mark} there.]{.underline} And [[they want a new
geopolitical bargain with Russia that effectively trades away the US
involvement in Ukraine for]{.mark} "extra-European" [agreements with
Russia on]{.mark} issues like]{.underline} arms control, [[the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, Iran, North Korea and even China. Peace in
our time [Trump promised repeatedly during his campaign that he would
end the war in Ukraine]{.underline}---and, more importantly, America's
involvement in it. He effectively ran on delivering a peace that Joe
Biden could not or would not provide. The content and duration of that
peace are nearly irrelevant. [[If Trump secures even a temporary
ceasefire, he can declare victory]{.mark} and drain the issue of Ukraine
from the US domestic agenda]{.underline}. At that point, no matter what
happens in Ukraine---whether the ceasefire lasts a month, trundles along
without resolution, or leads to a broader arrangement---Trump can simply
take his toys (ie, US military and intelligence assistance) and go home.
The idea---quite prominent in both European and American circles---that
Trump cannot politically afford to see Ukraine fail or that it could be
his "Afghanistan" misreads the role of Ukraine in US domestic politics.
Ukraine is Biden's war, with no support or even interest among Trump's
base. In any case, the US has never been directly involved as it was in
Afghanistan. There will be no US Marines blown up at Kyiv airport or
desperate Ukrainian refugees falling off US C-17s as they flee. Absent
such images, Trump can easily declare a ceasefire a victory and move
America on. Beyond the aura of peace, [the administration has another
goal in mind for these talks. In their first meeting with the
Russians]{.underline} in Riyadh in February, US secretary of state Marco
Rubio and national security advisor Mike Waltz [began laying the
groundwork for [a larger geopolitical deal that would go beyond the war
in Ukraine]{.mark}. The Trump administration seems to want [to
trade]{.mark} [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}---and even the US role in
European security---[[for Russian cooperation on]{.mark} a variety of
extra-European issues, including [Arctic resources]{.mark}]{.underline},
nuclear weapons negotiations, Iran, North Korea and Syria. Some in the
administration even dream of the fabled "reverse Kissinger" in which a
new US relationship with Russia could eventually drive a wedge between
Russia and China. [[This potential future relationship with Russia is an
additional factor in Trump's desire to end the war
quickly]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is a faction within Trump's
political base who view Russia not just as a geopolitical partner, but
as a culturally conservative ally that serves as a bastion of anti-woke,
"Christian" values. This domestic ideological influence helps explain
the administration's herculean efforts to blame Ukraine for starting
this war and the reluctance to hold Russia or Putin accountable for
their crimes.

[Trump's rhetoric leans toward an isolationist patriotism: if a conflict
doesn't touch U.S. soil, he's quick to sideline it, as seen with
Ukraine]{.underline}, or redefine it as a domestic concern, like his
Greenland and Canada gambits. [[For him, the Arctic seems less a
security priority than a bargaining chip]{.mark}, even as Russia ramps

northern flank with growing boldness. Canada's actions reflect a
conviction that Arctic security demands more than reliance on a
distracted United States. Russia's dominance in the region is undeniable
in key areas---its fleet of over 40 icebreakers dwarfs NATO's handful,
and its network of Arctic bases, paired with hypersonic missiles and
nuclear capabilities, outpaces the alliance's northern footprint.
Meanwhile, [the U.S.,]{.underline} despite bases in Alaska and
Greenland, [appears stretched thin]{.underline}.
[[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} focus on strong-arming allies into NATO

Recent experience in the Pacific suggests that [the US or Nato will seek
to assert rights of navigation under the UN convention on the law of the
sea. This is inherently risky. Russia could see such attempts to declare
freedom of navigation as a provocation]{.underline}. But failure to
enforce these freedoms carries an opposite risk: without maintaining a
presence in the region, Nato members would be allowing Russia's new law
to become normalised. A careful balancing act is essential to maintain
presence and not allow Russia to close off this region of the Arctic as
its private domain. [[Moscow sees Nato borders
expanding]{.underline}]{.mark}. It fears encirclement. Its experience of
humiliation in Ukraine has increased this tension. Two Arctic brigades
have been deployed to Ukraine with disastrous consequences; the
Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies estimates that more than 1,000
personnel have been lost. As Russia's conventional land forces have been
depleted in the Arctic, the Kremlin will turn to its naval and submarine
capacity. The potential to inflict damage to undersea cables and
pipelines is a lever that Putin could use against his opponents. [At the
moment, [it seems our politicians are not looking beyond the Ukraine
war. They need to]{.mark}. A weakened and resentful Russia does not make
for a stable global order. [We have already seen Putin pivot to China
and use the Arctic as a bargaining chip]{.mark} to strengthen that
relationship.]{.underline} It is scarcely a month since the two
countries' coastguards signed a memorandum in Murmansk about cooperation
in the Arctic. China's price for providing Russia with support over
Ukraine could be requesting naval access to Russian bases in the Arctic.

It\'s time to wake up. Providing autocrats with advanced technology does
not make them more peace-loving, better behaved, or mellow in any way.
Autocrats stay in power by fragmenting society and by fomenting
nationalist messages -- to counteract the demonstration effects created
by Western success. Drawing on either a religious or secular basis,
autocratic rulers tell their people: we are special, we are threatened,
it is us against control Russian society and to mobilise more than
enough popular support. The West has helped Ukraine, but slowly --
fearing the consequences of escalation, including the potential use of
nuclear weapons. [Think what happens [if Putin prevails]{.mark}. This
[will send a signal that autocratic nations can invade more democratic
neighbours]{.mark} with impunity. The [incentive for autocrats to
acquire nuclear weapons will also increase]{.mark}, because this
obviously allows them to get away with more.]{.underline} Recent
experience in Afghanistan reminds us that [democracy is rarely
successful when imposed from the outside]{.underline} (Brick
Murtazashvili 2022). And [when a country chooses democracy for itself,
the process can be contentious, with steps forward and back]{.underline}
-- as we have seen in many parts of Eastern Europe. [[For democracy to
flourish, or even to survive, it needs to have a 'safe haven'. This
means that expansionist autocrats need to keep their hands off]{.mark}
-- and their tanks out of -- countries such as Ukraine that are
attempting to control corruption, eliminate the power of oligarchy, and
genuinely become democratic]{.underline}. [[We are now entering the most
dangerous phase of the 21st century]{.mark}.]{.underline} Based on
prosperity due to its success as an exporter to industrial democracies,
China has picked up its game as an inventor of technology, particularly
for surveillance. The race to develop artificial intelligence is on,
with two big players: the US and China. Now the autocrats have a
potential source of oppressive technology being developed within their
own ranks -- although we should also not rule out that misguided Western
companies may invent tools that can be used to undermine our own
political systems (Acemoglu and Johnson 2023b). Over this century, the
number of people living in today's prosperous democracies will peak,
likely around 1.5 billion. But the world's population will continue to
grow from 8 billion today, towards 10 billion (United Nations 2022) or
perhaps even 12 billion. 7 India will soon become (or perhaps already
is) the world's most populous country, but [there is nothing secure
about]{.underline} its vaunted democracy now, as Prime Minister Narendra
Modi is reportedly using advanced surveillance technologies against
opponents 8 (these allegations have been denied). 9 Much of the
population growth in the coming decades will be in Africa, where the
conflict between democracy and autocracy is very much alive. What
technology will be invented or adopted in China, India, Latin America,
and Africa, who will benefit, and how will attempts to create more
democracies affect global security? Will there be a further emergence of
aggressive autocrats, using AI from China, drones from Iran, and
mercenaries from Russia? Much of this will be determined on the
battlefields of Ukraine. [If [Russia is allowed to continue occupying
Ukraine and to declare success, this would send a powerful and harmful
signal -- autocrats can invade democratic countries and get away with
murder.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Yet until recently, [the passion animating democratic forces appeared to
be waning, and the notion that democracy is in an irreversible crisis
was beginning to take hold]{.underline}. If that slide seems to have
been at least partly arrested of late, I would argue that the primary
cause is Ukraine's resistance to Russia's brutal 2022 invasion. [The
bravery of [Ukrainians]{.mark}]{.underline} and their resolve to defend
not only their land but also their fledgling democratic institutions
[have inspired defenders of freedom everywhere. They [have renewed the
sense that democracy is]{.mark} not just a worthy form of government but
also makes possible a way of life [worth fighting
for]{.mark}.]{.underline} President Zelensky has demonstrated that
[democracy still can give birth to statesmanlike and eloquent leaders,
capable of stirring and elevating the passions of their
people.]{.underline} Some have criticized the Ukrainians for their
encouragement of nationalist feelings. I think this criticism is largely
misplaced. First of all, it is hard to see how any democratic nation at
war can avoid an appeal to nationalism. Second, Ukrainian nationalism
has mostly taken a civic rather than an ethnic form. The patriotic
passions spurred by the war are more likely to bolster than to undermine
Ukraine's ability to build a democratic future. Like any other
democracy, Ukraine will need to cultivate the attachment of its
citizens, and the memories of its fight for freedom and independence
should make that attachment all the tighter. Let me conclude with a few
words about the task of rebuilding democratic consensus abroad. [Even
among democracies, alliances of sovereign states cannot be expected to
attain or even to aspire to the depth of consensus that is possible
within individual countries]{.underline}. That is why intergovernmental
organizations like NATO require in their decisionmaking unanimity among
their independent member-nations. Still, [[the]{.mark} Ukraine war [has
heightened cooperation]{.mark} and comity [among NATO
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} and the democracies of East Asia and
Oceania. [Most of these are countries that define themselves as members
of the democratic world, and [they have rallied around the goal of
defending democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. This has not been the case,
however, in what nowadays is called the Global South, where some key
countries have taken an equivocal stance toward Russia's aggression
against Ukraine. While this lack of a global consensus among democracies
is disappointing, I fear that it is something we will have to learn to
live with, at least for a while. In the near term, [[the prospects for
rebuilding democratic consensus will depend on developments on the
battlefields of Ukraine. A victory for Russia would have a devastating
effect on]{.mark} the morale of the [democracies]{.mark} [and encourage
aggression by other authoritarian powers]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Conversely, [a [Ukrainian victory would give an enormous boost to
democracy's self-confidence and discourage aggression]{.mark} elsewhere
by the authoritarians.]{.underline} The effects of a mixed outcome of
the war are much harder to foresee. [What is clear, however, is that
[the most urgent task]{.mark} for those seeking [to rebuild democratic
consensus]{.mark} both at home and abroad [is to help Ukraine beat back
Putin's war of aggression.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Democratic collapse is an existential threat \-\-- controls every impact

[As]{.underline} one of the [countless millions]{.underline} of people
who [were]{.underline} freed or [protected from totalitarianism by the
United States]{.underline} of America, [it is easy for me to talk about
the past]{.underline}. To talk about the belief of the American people
and their leaders that this country was exceptional, and had special
responsibilities to match its tremendous power. [That a nation founded
on freedom was bound to defend freedom everywhere]{.underline}. I could
talk about the bipartisan legacy of this most American principle, from
the Founding Fathers, to Democrats like Harry Truman, to Republicans
like Ronald Reagan. I could talk about how the American people used to
care deeply about human rights and dissidents in far-off places, and how
this is what made America a beacon of hope, a shining city on a hill.
[[America led by example and]{.mark} set a high standard, a standard
that [exposed]{.mark} the hypocrisy and cruelty of
[dictatorships]{.mark} around the world. But there is no time for
nostalgia]{.underline}. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse
of the Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War,
[[Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}, and America, [[have retreated]{.mark}
from those principles, and **[the world has become much worse
off]{.mark} as a result**]{.underline}. American skepticism about
America's role in the world deepened in the long, painful wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, and their aftermaths. Instead of applying the
lessons learned about how to do better, lessons about faulty
intelligence and working with native populations, the main outcome was
to stop trying. This result has been a tragedy for the billions of
people still living under authoritarian regimes around the world, and it
is based on faulty analysis. You can never guarantee a positive
outcome--- not in chess, not in war, and certainly not in politics. The
best you can do is to do what you know is right and to try your best. I
speak from experience when I say that the citizens of unfree states do
not expect guarantees. They want a reason to hope and a fighting chance.
[People living under dictatorships want the opportunity for
freedom]{.underline}, the opportunity to live in peace and to follow
their dreams. From the Iraq War to the Arab Spring to the current
battles for liberty from Venezuela to Eastern Ukraine, people are
fighting for that opportunity, giving up their lives for freedom. [The
United States must not abandon them. The United States and the rest of
the free world has an unprecedented advantage in economic and military
strength today. What is lacking is the will.]{.underline} The will to
make the case to the American people, [the will to take risks and invest
in the long-term security of the country, and the world]{.underline}.
This will require investments in aid, in education, in security that
allow countries to attain the stability their people so badly need. Such
investment is far more moral and far cheaper than the cycle of
[**[terror, war]{.mark}**, refugees, [and]{.mark} **military
i[ntervention]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[results when America leaves
a vacuum]{.mark} of power.]{.underline} The best way to help refugees is
to prevent them from becoming refugees in the first place. The Soviet
Union was an existential threat, and this focused the attention of the
world, and the American people. There [**[existential threat]{.mark}**
today is not found on a map, but it **[is very
real]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [forces of the past are making steady
progress against the modern world order. **[Terrorist]{.mark}**
movements in the Middle East, [extremist parties]{.mark} across Europe,
a paranoid tyrant in **[North Korea]{.mark} threatening [nuclear
blackmail,]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}, at the center of the
web, [an **[aggressive]{.mark} KGB dictator in
[Russia]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} They all want to turn the world back to a
dark past because their survival is threatened by]{.underline} the
[values of the free world, epitomized by the United States. And **they
[are thriving as the U.S. has retreated]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
global freedom index has declined for ten consecutive years. No one like
to talk about the United States as a global policeman, but [**this is
what happens when there is no cop on the beat. [American leadership
begins at home]{.mark}**, right here. America cannot lead the world on
democracy and human rights if there is no unity on]{.underline} the
[meaning and importance of these things. []{.mark}**Leadership is
required to make that case clearly and powerfully**. Right now,
Americans are engaged in politics at a level not seen in decades. It is
an opportunity for them to rediscover that making America great begins
with believing America can be great.]{.underline} The Cold War was won
on American values that were shared by both parties and nearly every
American. Institutions that were created by a Democrat, Truman, were
triumphant forty years later thanks to the courage of a Republican,
Reagan. This bipartisan consistency created the decades of strategic
[stability]{.underline} that [is the great strength of democracies.
Strong institutions that outlast politicians allow for long-range
planning]{.underline}. In contrast, dictators can operate only
tactically, not strategically, because they are not constrained by the
balance of powers, but cannot afford to think beyond their own survival.
This is why a dictator like Putin has an advantage in chaos, the ability
to move quickly. This can only be met by strategy, by long-term goals
that are based on shared values, not on polls and cable news. The fear
of making things worse has paralyzed the United States from trying to
make things better. There will always be setbacks, but the United States
cannot quit. [The spread of **[democracy is the only]{.mark}** proven
**[remedy for]{.mark}** nearly [**every crisis that plagues the world
today. War, famine, poverty, terrorism**--all are generated]{.mark} and
exacerbated [by authoritarian regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. A policy of
[America First inevitably puts American security last. **[American
leadership is required because there is no one
else]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and because it is good for America. [There
is no weapon or wall that is more powerful for security than America
being envied, imitated, and admired around the world. Admired not for
being perfect, but for having the exceptional courage to always try to
be better]{.underline}. Thank you.

### 2NC -- Impact Magnifier

#### Global democracy decreases conflict and increases isolation of authoritarian powers, decreasing the risk of global war. We control the direction of conflict escalation

Domestic regime type affects both inter-state conflict and alliance
formation. [Democratic peace theory posits that [democracies do not go
to war with one another]{.mark}, while [democratic alliance theory
suggests that they rarely]{.mark}, if ever, [join nondemocratic
alliances]{.mark}]{.underline} (or alliances led by nondemocratic
powers). [[Empirical evidence strongly supports both
theories]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Atlantic Council's Freedom and
Prosperity Indexes further reinforces the hypothesis that [economically
prosperous democracies tend to align with one another]{.underline},
whereas authoritarian states gravitate toward similarly nondemocratic
and less prosperous partners. If these theories hold, [they carry
significant implications for]{.underline} Western and especially [US
foreign policy.]{.underline} First, [[global democratization would
reduce the number of potential conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least
among an increasing number of democracies. Second, [it would [expand the
pool of democratic alliance partners]{.mark}, while at the same
[limiting the alliance options available to nondemocratic powers. This
strategic logic underscores the importance of upholding democratic norms
abroad and promoting democratization in nondemocratic
states.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, advocating for democratization of
nondemocratic great powers will be perceived as both a geopolitical and
domestic political challenge aimed at weakening their international
position and threatening their governments' domestic grip on power.
Efforts to democratize nondemocratic great-power like Russia and China
therefore provoke intense countermeasures. If such a strategy is deemed
to be too high risk or too difficult to pursue successfully, a less
provocative, "peripheral" strategy may focus on fostering democracy and
economic development in authoritarian regimes' weaker, less prosperous
partners, thereby depriving them of potential allies.

IV\. Implications for US foreign policy and strategy [Liberal thought
and theories have long posited a connection between democracy and
prosperity, as well as between democracy and peaceful international
relations]{.underline}. Democratic peace theory posits that [democracies
do not go to war with one another]{.underline} and attributes this
empirical fact to the democratic nature of their domestic political
regimes. Democratic alliance theory posits that democracies are more
likely to form alliances and collations with each other rather than with
nondemocracies. A corollary is that democracies rarely join alliances
led by nondemocracies. If both theories are true, this has important
implications for US foreign policy. If democratic peace theory and
democratic alliance theory are correct, [[the larger the number of
democracies, the less likely military conflict should become,]{.mark}
all things being equal]{.underline}. [[And the larger the number of
prosperous democracies, the larger the pool of potential alliance and
coalition members for democratic states and the smaller the pool of
potential allies for nondemocracies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Again,
democratic states do not necessarily join security alliances led by a
liberal power, though "High Freedom" and "High Prosperity" countries
seem to do so in overwhelming numbers and are highly unlikely to join
alliances led by or dominated by illiberal states. If this is so, [the
United States and Europe should support economic development and
democratization]{.underline}. Undoubtedly, if North Korea were to become
democratic, this would lead to unification with South Korea. Similarly,
a democratic Belarus would seek closer ties with the West, over time
cumulating in NATO and European Union membership, just like a democratic
Ukraine has been seeking to do. A democratic Iran would likely take a
far less antagonistic position vis-à-vis the United States and might
(again) become a major US security partner. [[Beijing and Moscow
understand this]{.mark}, and the very prospect of their nondemocratic
allies turning democratic represents a threat to their geopolitical
interests.]{.underline} This is why so-called color revolutions tend to
trigger strong reactions from both Russia and China. [[Supporting
democratic and economic development and widening the pool of potential
allies is imperative]{.mark} in light of China's continued economic
ascendance]{.underline}, which requires a forward-looking,
alliance-based foreign policy strategy and extensive external balancing
to maintain the balance of power in the future. It is also imperative
for another reason. According to the nonpartisan Freedom House,
political rights and civil liberties worsened in fifty-two countries in
2023 and improved in only twenty-one, representing a democratic decline
for the eighteenth consecutive year.20 If this trend is not halted and
reversed, it might negatively affect the propensity of countries with
weakening democratic institutions to join democratic alliances. They
might even become potential members of nondemocratic alliances. However,
the evidence supporting democratic peace and democratic alliance theory
must not be regarded as a license for a foreign policy of assertive
regime change and democratization. How best to promote democracy and
prosperity sustainably is a separate question that cannot be dealt with
here, except to say that establishing democracy by force has, at best, a
mixed record. 21 Moreover, policymakers should be aware that Russia and
China will see democracy promotion as a double threat and will likely
ramp up countermeasures, as it threatens both their geopolitical
position and the legitimacy of their own political systems. 22 [A
strategically less confrontational approach would be to deprive China
and Russia of potential allies by supporting democratization,
particularly in countries that are somewhat out of reach geographically
for China and Russia or where their geopolitical interests are less
intensive and extensive]{.underline}, such as in Latin America and
Africa. But what [[if it were possible to transform China and Russia
into democracies? Democratic peace theory suggests that the risk of
armed conflict would decline and relations might
improve]{.underline}]{.mark}. A caveat that needs to be kept in mind,
however, is that research suggests that countries transitioning toward
democracy become more militarily aggressive, at least temporarily. This
is attributed to the lack of accepted democratic norms or to political
entrepreneurs seeking to gain votes by playing the nationalist card.23
These are not particularly novel ideas. The "China as responsible
stakeholder" theory was, in part, premised on the expectation that
China's increasing prosperity would transform it into a liberal polity,
while a high level of international economic interdependence would lead
China to accept the international status quo.24 Similarly, liberals
hoped that political and economic liberalization in Russia would end
geopolitical competition in Europe. Neither was an unreasonable
expectation from a liberal and a historical point of view, and China and
Russia might yet become more democratic. For now, however, China has not
moved toward a more liberal-democratic form of government, and it is
challenging the international status quo in a variety of ways.
Similarly, Russia remains a nondemocracy quite willing to pursue its
interests by force. Nevertheless, US and European foreign policymakers
should support democratization and prosperity in order to reduce the
likelihood of armed conflict and limit the pool of potential alliance
members of nondemocratic powers. However, they should bear in mind that
the more such a policy's focus moves from strategically peripheral
countries to countries of greater strategic importance in the geographic
vicinity of the major nondemocratic powers themselves, the stronger the
geopolitical pushback of the latter will be. V. Policy recommendations •
Washington should broadly lend support to democratization, from
strategically peripheral countries to nondemocratic great powers, to
help reduce the risk of inter-state armed conflict over the longer term.
If democratic peace theory is correct, then the larger the number of
democracies, the less frequent inter-state military conflict becomes,
all things being equal. A caveat here is that a larger number of
democracies diminishes the overall likelihood of war but might do little
to prevent great-power war between democracies and nondemocracies. It
could even make war more likely if nondemocracies come to view their
geopolitical position as deteriorating because of a lack of allies and
coalition partners. • Washington should continue to support
democratization to reduce the number of countries inclined to align with
nondemocratic powers and to increase the number of potential US allies
and security partners. If the democratic alliance hypothesis is correct,
then geopolitical competition with Russia and China is the United
States' (and its democratic allies') to lose---provided the world does
not regress in terms of democracy. The more countries become democratic,
the fewer potential alliance partners nondemocracies like Russia, North
Korea, Iran, and China will have. One implication of democratic alliance
theory for US foreign policy is that lending support for democratization
and economic prosperity would reduce the pool of countries willing to
align with nondemocratic alliances and coalitions, while increasing the
number and propensity of countries to align themselves security-wise
with democratic alliances. • Washington might also want to consider
supporting democratization in China and Russia, bearing in mind that
Beijing and Moscow will consider this a direct threat, and staying
cognizant of the concomitant risk of a further deterioration of
relations. If democratic peace theory is correct, and if China and
Russia were to become democracies, the risk of great-power war should
recede once democratic norms and culture are consolidated in the
previously nondemocratic countries. A caveat here is that countries in
the early stages of democratization might behave more belligerently.
Another caveat is that a policy aimed at democratizing the major
nondemocratic powers themselves will likely make them more antagonistic,
as they view such efforts as a direct threat to their regimes' survival.
This should be taken into account when designing foreign policy and
strategy. [[The empirical support for democratic peace theory is strong,
and the hypothesis that democracies do not go to war with other
democracies can be considered a well-confirmed empirical
generalization]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if there are disagreements as
to its underlying causal logic. [[The evidence in favor of democratic
alliance theory is also solid.]{.mark} Both theories provide a sound
intellectual basis for a US foreign policy and strategy that support
democratization and prosperity.]{.underline} If democratic peace theory
is correct, [then the larger the number of democracies, the less
frequent inter-state military conflict becomes, all other things being
equal.]{.underline} If democratic alliance theory is correct, then the
larger the number of democracies, the larger the potential pool of US
allies and the smaller the pool of actual and potential allies of
nondemocratic great powers. [If democratic peace theory is correct,
successful and sustainable democratization of China and Russia holds the
prospect of a more peaceful future---perhaps even the sort of perpetual
peace Immanuel Kant envisioned]{.underline}. As Jack Levy, a prominent
political scientist and leading scholar of international conflict, wrote
shortly after the end of the Cold War, "\[Democratic peace theory\] also
provides additional hope to those who believe that world politics is
undergoing a fundamental transformation in which war will play a more
limited role, and that activist state policies to encourage the spread
of democratic institutions and attitudes on a world scale can contribute
to this transformation."25

It was not, however, [until World War I that the full democratic peace
proposition became central to foreign policy]{.underline}. Wilson\'s war
message in April 1917 \-- in which he declared that the battle between
autocracies and democracies would establish \"the principles of peace
and justice\" \-- was the clarion call. [The clash between democracy and
autocracy continued to shape policy as the decades went on]{.underline}.
The behavior of the United States during the Cold War, for example, was
often motivated by a belief that spreading liberal values would yield
peace. As Secretary of State John Foster Dulles declared in his 1953
Senate confirmation hearing, \"We shall never have a secure peace or a
happy world so long as Soviet communism dominates one-third of all the
peoples that there are.\" President John F. Kennedy echoed that theme in
his 1963 speech in West Berlin, declaring that \"when all are free, then
we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and
this country and this great Continent of Europe in a peaceful and
hopeful globe.\" But that same month, in a powerful address at American
University, Kennedy warned of the complementary dangers of ideological
confrontation with the Soviet Union. \"Let us not be blind to our
differences \-- but let us also direct attention to our common interests
and the means by which those differences can be resolved,\" he said.
\"If we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the
world safe for diversity.\"TIME AFTER TIME [[As liberalism endured and
spread, intellectuals began empirically testing]{.mark} whether
[democratic peace theory]{.mark} actually held true]{.underline}. In
1939, the American journalist Clarence Streit published a qualitative
historical analysis to see whether liberal democracies tended to
maintain peace among themselves. Discerning that the answer was yes, he
proposed that the decade\'s leading democracies form a federal union,
which would help protect them from fascist powers. In 1972, Dean Babst,
building on Quincy Wright\'s magisterial\^ Study of War from 30 years
earlier, carried out a statistical analysis that also suggested a
correlation between democracy and peace. In 1976, Melvin Small and J.
David Singer confirmed this finding but demonstrated that democratic
peace was limited to relations between democracies. Republics, they
showed, were still prone to fight autocratic regimes. In the decades
since, [[international relations scholars]{.mark} have continued to
study the democratic peace paradigm. They [have shown that the
relationship between democracy and peace is statistically significant
even when controlling for proximity, wealth, and trade.]{.mark} They
have determined that [the theory holds even when states attempt to
constrain each other]{.mark}. Academics have advanced a wide variety of
explanations for why the concept is so st]{.underline}urdy. Some have
argued that part of the reason lies in the disproportionate influence
that international institutions have with liberal countries. Research
shows that [[democracies tend to delegate a lot of policymaking to
complex multilateral bodies,]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the European
Union and the World Trade Organization, [in part because their leaders
can use these groups [to entrench policies]{.mark} before cycling out of
office. Other scholars have argued that [liberal norms favoring peace,
human rights, and respect for fellow democracies hold sway over
policymakers]{.mark} and publics. And still others have pointed to [the
benefits of trade and economic interdependence associated with relations
among capitalist democracies. States that frequently trade]{.mark},
after all, [will lose wealth if they fight one
another]{.mark}.]{.underline} Still, democratic peace theory has
attracted plenty of critics. Henry Farber and Joanne Gowa have pointed
out that there are other forces at work in stopping wars between
democracies. During the Cold War, for example, NATO\'S need to protect
itself from the Soviet bloc ensured that Western Europe cooperated \--
although the region\'s post-Cold War peace suggests more than
collaborative containment is at work. Other scholars have pointed out
that none of the factors used to explain democratic peace theory can
stop war on its own. States that are deeply involved in international
institutions, after all, do launch invasions. Peaceful norms and ideas
work only if democracies heed them in the policymaking process, yet they
are often ignored. The shared decision-making powers of republics should
encourage deliberation, but the division of powers and rotation of
elites can also lead democracies to send mixed signals, putting other
states on edge. And economic benefits can be achieved through plunder,
not just through trade. Powerful democratic states can have rational
incentives to exploit wealthy, weak democracies, especially if the
latter are endowed with natural resources or strategic assets such as
shipping lanes. Rational material interest is not enough to explain why
xenophobic democracies have not tried to conquer democracies of other
ethnic groups. But [[put all the explanatory factors together, and
democratic peace theory coheres. When governments are constrained by
international institutions, when political elites or the electorate are
committed to norms of liberty]{.mark}, when the public\'s views are
reflected through representative institutions, [and when democracies
trade and invest in one another, conflicts among republics are
peacefully resolved]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Ukrainian Nuclear War 

#### Russian nuclear posture makes nuclear escalation in Ukraine more likely.

Agency Team Lead for the U.S. European Command from 2016 to 2019. "How
the War in Ukraine Could Go Nuclear---by Accident" Foreign Affairs.

Accessed 7/6/25. ARJSH

A nuclear state's greatest responsibility is to keep its warheads
secure. [[Since Russia invaded Ukraine]{.mark} in February 2022, [it has
put]{.mark} approximately [30 percent of its]{.mark} estimated 5,580
[warheads in an untenably precarious position.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Early in the war, [concerns that the invasion increased the danger of a
nuclear detonation or accidental explosion focused on the risk to
Ukraine's four nuclear power plants and Russia's threats to
intentionally escalate the conflict past the nuclear
threshold.]{.underline} But [[the more Ukraine seeks to hit targets
inside Russia, the clearer it becomes that Russia's unwillingness to
adequately secure the nuclear arsenals]{.underline}]{.mark} it has
stored in its west---which are now within striking distance of Ukrainian
missiles and drones and even Ukrainian troops---[[poses a dire
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}. Every week, Russia is launching up to 800
guided aerial bombs and over 500 attack drones at Ukrainian cities and
energy plants. In response, Ukraine has begun launching up to hundreds
of drones daily at carefully selected Russian targets. Ukraine has every
right to defend itself in this manner, and there is no indication that
Ukrainian forces would intentionally target nuclear warhead storage
sites. Because Ukrainian drone assaults have already reached as far as
Moscow, however, [it is clear that at least [14 Russian nuclear storage
sites now fall within range of]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[[drones]{.mark}. At least two of those sites are less than 100 miles
from the Ukrainian border, well within striking range of the more
damaging missiles Ukraine already possesses]{.underline}, and another
five sites lie less than 200 miles from the border, close to or just
beyond the range of the advanced Western-provided missiles that Ukraine
is seeking permission to use against conventional targets in Russia.
[The responsibility to move its nuclear warheads out of the way of
danger lies with the Russian government.]{.underline} Russia knows that
its warheads should not be positioned anywhere near conventional
military operations: after Ukraine launched its first drone and missile
attacks against Belgorod in the spring of 2023, Russia quickly reported
that its Belgorod storage site was no longer storing nuclear
warheads---acknowledging that warheads should not be stored anywhere
near active fighting. But remarkably, there have been no Russian
announcements about the status of the warheads it has at any of its
other storage sites. [There are several possible reasons for Russia's
clear dereliction of duty here]{.underline}: Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin may believe that moving Russian nuclear warheads would be a sign
of weakness]{.underline}]{.mark}; senior Russian leaders may not
recognize the dangers posed to these warheads; or the Russian military
may fear that the West would misconstrue moving warheads as preparations
for a nuclear attack, prompting a preemptive strike by NATO. The country
that likely has the most influence over Russia's handling of its nuclear
arsenal is China. In September, Beijing became coordinator of the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty's P5 process, a forum of the five
original nuclear weapons states---China, France, Russia, the United
Kingdom, and the United States---designed so those countries could
jointly discuss their responsibilities. In this capacity, the Chinese
leadership can---and must---lead a collective effort to persuade Russia
to secure its vulnerable warheads, drawing on its own expanding
bilateral relationship with Moscow. If China does not push for this, the
risk that Russian nuclear sites become entangled in its war on Ukraine
will only continue to grow, with potentially catastrophic consequences
both for Russia and for the rest of the world. The possibility that a
Ukrainian drone or missile will strike a warhead and create an explosion
that distributes fissile material is already a major risk. But it is not
the only one. Even more dangerous is the possibility that a Ukrainian
missile strike or territorial takeover could throw a storage site into
operational chaos, allowing rogue actors to seize its nuclear
warheads---or inadvertently prompt Russian nuclear escalation. WARHEAD
GAMES In 1991, as the collapse of the Soviet Union appeared imminent,
the U.S. Congress established the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program,
which aimed to help Russia secure the vast Soviet nuclear arsenal of
approximately 30,000 nuclear warheads that it inherited. Because these
storage sites were no longer overseen by the Soviet police state, their
locations were no longer secret, they had little or no security
equipment, and their guards were not getting paid. With the CTR's
assistance, Russia reduced its number of warheads and consolidated its
arsenal within 42 existing storage facilities that were equipped with
modern security features. The warheads were secured at three kinds of
sites: 12 large central locations that housed hundreds of strategic and
nonstrategic warheads; 30 smaller storage facilities adjacent to
military bases, which stored dozens of warheads that could be fitted to
the missiles, submarines, ships, or aircraft at the bases; and three
rail transfer points where warheads can be transferred to and from
trains to trucks. Russian warheads are frequently moved for maintenance
and safety checks, so these transfer points almost always have warheads
at them---and these rail transfer points are where the warheads are most
vulnerable, because they are not in secure bunkers and are protected
only by the trucks' and rail cars' reinforced exteriors. In the
immediate aftermath of the Cold War, most experts viewed the primary
threat to Russia's nuclear stockpiles to be a potential terrorist
attack---which could even be carried out by up to 12 assailants---rather
than armed conflict with another well-armed state. Over the course of 30
years leading the CTR's bilateral effort to secure Russia's warheads, I
met more than 75 times with the leaders of the organization within
Russia's Defense Ministry responsible for maintaining and securing
Russia's nuclear arsenal. I visited dozens of Russian nuclear warhead
storage sites, including those in Belgorod and Voronezh, near Russia's
border with Ukraine. And by 2008, Russia's nuclear arsenal appeared
relatively safe from such a terrorist threat. Security upgrades had been
installed at all the warhead storage sites and rail transfer points.
Every storage site was provided with three layers of security fencing,
microwave and fence disturbance sensors, lights, video cameras, new
security gates, and a fully equipped security control building. But
[these upgrades were not designed to protect the warheads from attacks
by a well-armed military force---and they cannot do so. [When Russia
initiated its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it brought a conventional
war near areas where hundreds of nuclear warheads are
stored]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia's Belgorod central storage site,
which may have stored hundreds of nuclear warheads, is located less than
30 miles from the Ukrainian border north of the city of Kharkiv, where
Russia instigated heavy fighting. It is also just south of the Kursk
region, where Ukrainian forces launched a major incursion into Russia in
August and where fighting continues now. Russia reported that it removed
all the warheads from this site, but it is not clear if that was done
before or after the fighting began. Moving nuclear warheads during a
conventional war is extremely dangerous behavior and would demonstrate
that Russia is no longer a conscientious nuclear power. The warheads
could have been struck accidentally by drones or missiles---or
deliberately attacked or stolen. The major Voronezh storage site,
although it is farther east, is still less than 190 miles from the
Ukrainian border. Already, there have been multiple drone attacks less
than 100 miles from it. [[Russia has also breached a sacred tenet of
nuclear security by launching attacks against Ukraine from military
bases that store nuclear warheads, thus making those bases a legitimate
target for counteroffensive]{.mark}s]{.underline}. Since March 2022, for
instance, Russia has been using the Engels-2 air base 500 miles
southeast of Moscow to launch Kinzhal missile attacks on Ukraine.
Kinzhal missiles are dual capable, meaning they can carry nuclear
warheads, and there are probably dozens of nuclear warheads stored less
than four miles from the Engels-2 base's main airfields. Ukraine has
allegedly repeatedly attacked this air base with drones, including as
recently as mid-September. [Russia is believed to store dozens of
nuclear warheads for short-range aircraft at the Yeysk air base, an
installation directly across the Sea of Azov from Mariupol.]{.underline}
Dozens more may be stored at Morozovsk, another aircraft base less than
100 miles from Luhansk, where Russian forces are fighting off Ukrainian
troops to try to recapture lost territory. The longer the war continues,
the more one or more of these sites risk getting caught in
crossfire---an outcome that could have devastating consequences. TIME
BOMB A strike on a storage site would not in itself cause warheads to
detonate in a nuclear explosion. But [[if a warhead is not in its
bunker]{.mark} because it is being moved for maintenance within the
storage site or at a rail transfer point, [and it is hit by an
armed]{.mark} drone or [missile]{.mark}, that [could cause a major
explosion that would release fissile material]{.mark} and render a
several-mile radius uninhabitable for years]{.underline}. International
observers might not even be able to judge how catastrophic such a strike
had been, because Russian reporting on nuclear incidents historically
cannot be trusted. And [even if an attack did not directly strike a
warhead, it could damage nuclear security systems or kill guards, thus
rendering the warheads vulnerable to theft.]{.underline} Nuclear
warheads are especially unsafe when they are located at Russia's rail
transfer points. Although it is unclear whether Russia is currently
moving warheads through any of these sites, if it is doing so, then a
Ukrainian drone or debris from a bomber, Russian air defense system, or
missile attack could easily hit them. Given that Russia has an inventory
of thousands of warheads, there are almost always a handful that are
being moved for maintenance. Ukraine, the United States, NATO, and
open-source satellites may not be able to differentiate whether Russia
is transporting warheads for maintenance or security---or to a military
base from which they might be launched. Imagine if the United States or
Ukraine detected a covert warhead movement and interpreted it to be part
of an intentional operation against Ukraine or a NATO country: they
would have to consider targeting that warhead shipment preemptively.
Beyond [the immediate risks, [storing nuclear warheads in a war zone
increases the likelihood of escalatory actions]{.mark} by the Kremlin.
Russia's nuclear doctrine holds that an attack on any element of its
deterrent force justifies a nuclear response. It is not clear whether an
accidental strike on a nuclear warhead storage site would cross a
Russian nuclear redline,]{.underline} but Putin has recently sought to
draw attention to his country's escalation doctrine. [The [fact that its
nuclear warheads are so close to Ukraine could]{.mark}, in fact, [tempt
Russia to conduct a false-flag operation on its own storage sites in
order to justify a nuclear attack]{.mark}.]{.underline} But perhaps the
greatest danger now posed by Russia's nuclear weapons storage sites is
the one that was originally envisioned after the Cold War's end: that
is, the danger that warheads could be seized by a small, rogue group of
fighters. Russia still faces internal threats including terrorists,
separatists, and the thousands of former Wagner fighters now scattered
across Russia and Belarus. Its actions in Ukraine have greatly
exacerbated the danger posed by these long-standing threats. On August
6, Ukrainian troops entered Russian territory and captured a swath of
the Kursk region---an area that lies between two large Russian storage
sites (in Bryansk and Voronezh) housing hundreds of warheads. The
concern is not that the Ukrainian military would do something hazardous
with loose nukes. But if the Ukrainian military were to attack or drive
Russian security forces away from a storage site, rogue actors could
enter the site and seize its warheads. Former members of the Wagner
paramilitary company, for instance, might wish to use such warheads
against Ukraine, or Russians fighting on Ukraine's behalf might wish to
attack a Russian city. A single Russian actor could instigate such an
operation with or without direction from Russian authorities. And with
its military tied up in Ukraine, Russia simply may not have military
forces available to respond to an attack on a warhead storage site or
convoy. RESTORING TRUST [To truly safeguard its nuclear arsenal, Russia
would need to end its onslaught against Ukraine and the increasingly
complicated cross-border conflict that its invasion has generated. But
with no instant end to the war in sight, more immediate steps must be
urgently taken]{.underline}. In the near term, Russian nuclear warheads
must be removed from any base that is close to wartime operations and
bases from which Russia is launching conventional attacks. Thus far,
[Russia has failed to move its warheads out of danger]{.underline}.
Russia believes that its advantage in nonstrategic nuclear weapons
serves to deter Ukrainian and Western escalation against Russia. But in
truth, if Russia wants to maintain that advantage, it must end the war
or relocate the warheads to safer locations. [Nuclear deterrence does
not depend on warheads being located on a country's frontlines. In fact,
a country best maintains its deterrence if it stores its nuclear weapons
well out of harm's way.]{.underline} Russia must immediately facilitate
the safe movements of all of its warheads located within 500 miles of
the Ukraine border to storage sites east of the Ural Mountains. China,
which has become a crucial partner for Russia since the war began, is in
the best position to press Russia on this point. It can push Russian
leaders to secure their warheads during bilateral discussions or within
the P5 forum. Ultimately, China cannot view Russia as a credible nuclear
power, or partner, if Russia cannot secure its nuclear warheads away
from military operations. The other countries that are signatories to
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as well as the members of the UN
General Assembly can also pressure Russia. If Russia does not agree to
move its warheads after this concern is raised by the P5 and the UN,
repercussions as severe as the country's temporary or permanent removal
from the UN Security Council are warranted. As a signatory to the NPT,
China may even support such an action: Beijing cannot, in fact, afford
any incident involving nuclear weapons to occur as a result of the war
in Ukraine, because that would draw much more scrutiny to its own
nuclear buildup. The world must convince Russia that it is fundamentally
endangering its reputation as a responsible nuclear power: its
management of its nuclear arsenal over the past two and a half years
clearly violates the basic responsibilities expected of nuclear states.

Conflict With NATO

[Russia will remain intent on maintaining---and expanding]{.underline}
where possible---[its influence in the former Soviet space]{.underline}.
Yet [Putin's ultimate objective is to undermine NATO and restore some
semblance of its former empire]{.underline}---an expanse that includes
countries now within the NATO alliance. Putin's specific aims within
that larger vision are difficult to surmise. In December 2021, with its
forces massed on Ukraine's border, Moscow put forward a list of demands
required for lowering tensions. Among its demands, the Kremlin proposed
barring Ukraine's entry into NATO, an end to NATO's further eastward
expansion, and NATO's removal of any troops or weapons deployed to
countries that joined the alliance after 1997---which would include
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and the Balkan countries. The
demands could be seen as an extreme opening bid in Moscow's desired
negotiations with Washington, but they offer insight into how Russia
would seek to reconfigure Europe.

Even beyond rolling NATO back and re-establishing a new version of the
Russian Empire, however, [[Moscow is]{.underline}]{.mark} also likely
[[looking for an opportunity to break]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark}
alliance]{.underline}---to [discredit Article V]{.underline} and its
promise of collective defense---[with the goal of fracturing the
West]{.underline} and returning Russia to what it views as its rightful
role as a great power in Europe and globally. **[[So long as the war in
Ukraine continues, Russia will lack the capacity to take on
NATO.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} continues to
view NATO as a credible deterrent and [[currently has no intent
to]{.mark} [widen the war]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine [and directly
challenge the alliance]{.underline}. Yet, [even with numerous factors
working to dissuade Russia from directly challenging NATO]{.underline},
[there remain plausible pathways to conflict between NATO and
Russia.]{.underline}

ACCIDENTAL AND UNINTENDED ESCALATION

The [war in Ukraine has increased the chances of accidental escalation
that could lead to a direct conflict between NATO and
Russia]{.underline}. The **[[risk of]{.mark}]{.underline}** such an
**[[escalation has risen]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as Russia has
demonstrated its willingness to take ever-riskier actions near NATO
territory]{.underline}. Several incidents underline the risk: in
[November 2022,]{.underline} for example, [a missile---ultimately
determined to be an errant Ukrainian air defense missile launched in
response to Russian strikes---landed in Poland, killing two Polish
citizens]{.underline}. In [March 2024, a Russian missile
violated]{.underline}---likely accidentally---[Polish airspace during a
Russian missile attack on Ukraine]{.underline}; Russian [drone debris
has fallen inside Romania; and]{.underline} in [March 2024, a Russian
missile exploded near a convoy carrying President Zelensky and Greek
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Odesa]{.underline}.31 The
[risk]{.underline} of accidental escalation [is highest in and around
the Black Sea,]{.underline} which is bordered by three NATO countries
and has become an "increasingly dangerous cauldron of military and
geopolitical tensions."32

The [**risk of unintended escalation**---]{.underline}escalation [that
stems from deliberate intimidation or coercion that the perpetrator does
not view as escalatory but that its opponent interprets as
such---**has** also **risen**.]{.underline} This development is, in
large part, [because]{.underline} throughout the course of the war
[**[it has become]{.mark}** more **[difficult]{.mark}** for the United
States and NATO **[to discern]{.mark}** Russia's "**[red
lines,]{.mark}**" and vice versa]{.underline}. [Russia's [lack of
response]{.mark}]{.underline} [to various threats previously considered
to cross Russia's red lines]{.underline}---for example, Ukrainian
strikes into Russian territory or the West's provision of increasingly
sophisticated weapons systems---[has [increased uncertainty]{.mark} in
the West about what actions would really trigger an escalatory Russian
response]{.underline}. **[[The fact]{.mark} that [Russia has not]{.mark}
yet [responded]{.mark} [does not mean]{.mark} there are [no
actions]{.mark} by the United States and its European allies that [would
cause Russia to escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this context of
increased ambiguity, [a scenario where the West misreads Russia and
takes an action that the Kremlin ultimately deems escalatory is easy to
imagine.33]{.underline}

This [risk]{.underline} could be [amplified by]{.underline} possible
[Kremlin concerns about a decline in the credibility of its
threats]{.underline}. As the war has continued, the [West's initially
cautious approach has given way to more assertive support]{.underline},
including the provision of sophisticated weapons systems to Ukraine.
Such **[[concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to the extent they exist,
could **[[lead the Kremlin to respond]{.mark} more [harshly]{.mark} than
expected [to any]{.mark} given [Western action to reestablish]{.mark}
the [credibility]{.mark} of its threats]{.underline}**, similarly
**[[setting off]{.mark} an [escalatory spiral]{.mark}.]{.underline}**34

The [Kremlin is also likely uncertain of where the West's red lines
lie]{.underline}. As [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} grows more brazen in
his actions to antagonize the West, he [[could misjudge]{.mark} and take
a step too far]{.underline} by [pursuing an action that elicits a
stronger than expected Western response]{.underline}. Putin's
[trajectory]{.underline} since he returned to office in 2012 [has been
one of [increasing tolerance for risk**, as he has come to judge that
doing so pays off.**]{.mark}]{.underline}35 It is plausible that
[Putin's brazenness becomes out of control or an anxious NATO ally
responds more forcefully]{.underline} than Putin anticipates, once again
[setting off an escalatory spiral]{.underline}. Looking forward, [an
approach by NATO member states to increase strategic
[ambiguity]{.mark}]{.underline}---or generate greater uncertainty about
what they are willing to do to support Ukraine---could also
[[raise]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark} of unintended escalation.]{.underline}
Increasing Western strategic ambiguity could be useful in compelling
Russia to act with greater restraint, but it could also simultaneously
contribute to an overall environment of uncertainty.

### 2NC -- A2: Putin Bluffing

#### While Putin bluffs now, any risk of nuclear escalation should be avoided

**Stein 2024.** Janice Stein is the founding director of the Munk School
of Global Affairs & Public Policy and the Belzberg Professor of conflict
management with the Department of Political Science at the University of
Toronto. "How impossible is the risk of nuclear escalation in Ukraine?"

Accessed 6/30/25. ARJSH

Context matters. If nuclear escalation through technical or political
miscalculation is not a grave concern in the transition period between
the Biden and Trump administrations, another pattern is concerning. From
the beginning of the war in Ukraine, [[Putin has hinted that the use of
a nuclear weapon is a live option]{.mark}. Before]{.underline} launching
[his]{.underline} full-scale [invasion]{.underline} in February 2022,
[he]{.underline} ordered an unknown level of alert that proved to be no
more than increased staffing of strategic command centers and [issued
veiled nuclear threats if NATO were to intervene]{.underline}. A few
months later, [[Putin loosened operational controls on tactical nuclear
weapons and]{.mark} two years later [lowered the threshold of nuclear
use]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even though [Putin]{.underline} never appeared
to approach a decision to use a nuclear weapon, he [manipulated the
threat to use nuclear weapons]{.underline} to deter NATO from supplying
weapons to Ukraine. This strategy failed again and again. The United
States and its Western allies supplied Ukraine with increasingly more
sophisticated equipment over time despite the "nuclear noise." They
judged Putin's intentions not by what he said but by the larger context
in which he was making his thinly veiled threats designed to coerce.
They took him seriously only once when Russian forces were in retreat.
[Context always matters, even when the threats are nuclear]{.underline}.
Putin now has the unenviable reputation of someone who bluffs. This
reputation can only encourage NATO to continue to call his bluff in the
future. But [[one day Putin may not be bluffing]{.mark}.]{.underline} If
leaders do not pay attention to context, [[they may well miss the
"signal" that,]{.mark} this time, [Russia is serious about using a
nuclear weapon to coerce an adversary.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC -- A2: Internal Link Turn

#### The direction of the link goes NEG. Either Trump gets worked by Putin in negotiations into giving up Ukraine or Trump just gives Putin what he wants to curry favor. Putin takes that victory and causes global instability

[[Putin sees]{.mark} what everyone else sees:]{.underline} Slowly, [[the
U.S.]{.mark} is [switching sides]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} True,
Trump occasionally berates Putin, or makes sympathetic noises toward
Ukrainians, as he did last week when he seemed to express interest in a
Ukrainian journalist who said that her husband was in the military.
Trump also appeared to enjoy being flattered at the NATO summit, where
European leaders made a decision, hailed as historic, to further raise
defense spending. But thanks to quieter decisions by members of his own
administration, people whom he has appointed, [the American realignment
with Russia and against Ukraine and Europe is gathering pace---not
merely in rhetoric but in reality.]{.underline} Just this week, in the
middle of the worst aerial-bombing campaign since the war began, the
[[Trump]{.mark} administration [confirmed]{.mark} that a large shipment
of [weapons]{.mark}, which had already been funded by the Biden
administration, [will not be sent to Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
weapons, some of which are already in Poland, include artillery shells,
missiles, rockets, and, most important, interceptors for Patriot
air-defense systems, the ammunition that Ukrainians need to protect
civilians from missile attacks. Trump had suggested that he would supply
Ukraine with more Patriot ammunition, which is an American product.
"We're going to see if we can make some available," he said after
meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. But what he
says and what his administration actually does are very different.
Pentagon spokespeople have explained that this abrupt change was made
because American stockpiles are insufficient, an excuse disputed both by
former Biden-administration officials and by independent policy
analysts. But whether true or false, this reasoning doesn't matter to
[the Russians]{.underline}, who [have]{.underline} already [interpreted
this change as a clear [signal]{.mark} that [American support for
Ukraine is ending]{.mark}: "[The fewer]{.mark} the number of
[weapons]{.mark} that are delivered to Ukraine, [the closer
the]{.mark}]{.underline} end of the special military operation," the
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. To be clear, by "the end
of the special military operation," he means the [[defeat of
Ukraine.]{.underline}]{.mark} At the same time, and with much less
publicity, [the U.S. is [essentially lifting sanctions on
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. No such formal announcement has been made.
But [the maintenance of sanctions requires constant shifts and
adjustments]{.underline}, as Russian companies and other entities change
suppliers and tactics in order to acquire sanctioned products. During
the Biden administration, I spoke several times with officials who
followed these changes closely, and who repeatedly issued new sanctions
in order to counter them. As The New York Times has reported, [the Trump
administration has stopped following these shifts and stopped imposing
new sanctions altogether.]{.underline} This, the Times writes, allows
"new dummy companies to funnel funds and critical components to Russia,
including computer chips and military equipment." In addition to taking
Russia's side in the kinetic war and the economic war, [the U.S. is
realigning its position in the narrative war]{.underline}, too. During
the Biden administration, the State Department's Global Engagement
Center regularly identified Russian disinformation operations around the
world---exposing misleading websites or campaigns secretly run or
directed by Russian operatives in Latin America and Africa, as well as
in Europe. Trump appointees have not only dissolved the center; they
also baselessly and bizarrely accused it of somehow harming American
conservatives, even of having "actively silenced and censored the voices
of Americans," although the GEC had no operations inside the U.S. At the
same time, [cuts to USAID and other programs have abruptly reduced
funding for]{.underline} some independent media and [Russian-opposition
media]{.underline}. The planned cuts to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty,
if not stopped by the courts, will destroy one of the few outside
sources of information that reaches Russians with real news about the
war. Should all of these changes become permanent, the U.S. will no
longer have any tools available to communicate with the Russian public
or counter Russian propaganda, either inside Russia or around the world.
Inside the United States, Russian propaganda is most loudly and
effectively promoted by appointees of the U.S. president. Steve Witkoff,
the real-estate developer who became Trump's main negotiator with Russia
despite having no knowledge of Russian history or politics, regularly
echoes false Russian talking points and propaganda. He has repeated
Putin's view, which he may have heard from the Russian president
himself, that "Ukraine is just a false country, that they just patched
together in this sort of mosaic, these regions." Witkoff has also seemed
to agree with Putin that Ukrainian territories that voted for
independence from Moscow in 1991 are somehow "Russian." By accepting
disputed claims as fact, Witkoff is also helping Putin continue his war.
In order to keep Russians onboard, to create divisions among Ukraine's
allies, and maybe even to build doubts inside Ukraine itself, Putin
needs to portray the Ukrainian cause as hopeless and to describe the
Ukrainian "demands" as unreasonable. [He has to hide the most basic
facts about this war: that he began it, that he has killed hundreds of
thousands of people in pursuit of it, and that his goal, again, is to
destroy or decapitate all of Ukraine]{.underline}. Witkoff helps make
these falsehoods easier to sustain, in Russia, in the U.S., and in
Europe. [Add all of [these things]{.mark} together, and they
[are]{.mark} something [more than just a pattern]{.mark}. They are a set
of incentives that help persuade Putin to keep fighting]{.underline}.
Sanctions are disappearing, weapons are diminishing, counterpropaganda
is harder to hear. [All of [that will encourage Putin to go
further]{.mark}---not just to try [to defeat Ukraine]{.mark} but to
[divide Europe, mortally damage NATO]{.mark}, and reduce the power and
influence of the United States around the world.]{.underline}

[Since the Arctic Council was established in 1996, [the A8 has worked on
issues of environmental protection, sustainable development, human
security and scientific collaboration]{.mark}. That harmony has been
crucial in an era in which climate change is causing the rapid melting
of Arctic ice.]{.underline} Notably, the Arctic Council played an
instrumental role in negotiating several legally binding treaties. These
include agreements on search and rescue (2011), marine oil pollution
preparedness (2013) and scientific cooperation (2017). It also supported
the Central Arctic Ocean fisheries agreement (CAO) signed in 2018 by the
Arctic Ocean states with Iceland, the EU, China, Japan and South Korea.
The Arctic Council -- and more broadly, circumpolar cooperation --
withstood the geopolitical aftershocks of Russia's seizure of Crimea and
parts of eastern Ukraine between 2014 and 2015. But [[Russia's]{.mark}
full-scale [invasion of Ukraine left trust teetering]{.mark} on the
precipice.]{.underline} Within a month, [European and [North American
members had pressed pause on regular meetings of the Arctic Council and
its scientific working groups, isolating Mosco]{.mark}w]{.underline}.
Some activity eventually resumed at the working group level in virtual
formats, but [[full engagement with Russia has remained conditional on a
military withdrawal from Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile,
[[hefty sanctions]{.mark} were imposed [by the US]{.mark} and Europe,
including [targeting Russian Arctic energy]{.mark}
projects.]{.underline} Russia's response was to enhance its
relationships with others. Countries such as Brazil, India, Turkey and
Saudi Arabia now work with Russia in the Arctic on commercial and
scientific projects. This pivot raised concerns among Nato allies about
a stronger and challenging Russia-China presence across the Arctic. But
[the second [Trump]{.mark} administration [has changed the
calculus]{.mark}. There's now the threat of a new Arctic order based on
the primacy -- not of the A8 -- but on a reset of US-Russia
relations.]{.underline}

[[The Kremlin]{.mark}'s foreign policy in the [Arctic]{.mark} walks a
clumsy tightrope]{.underline}. It uses international law when
convenient, courts China and India as symbolic partners, and flirts with
building "alternative" institutions, all while fearing Beijing and
[quietly hoping for the West to resume cooperation]{.underline}. Unlike
its more coherent economic and military Arctic strategies, [its
[diplomatic approach is piecemeal and opportunistic]{.mark}---less a
roadmap and more [a toolkit for tactical
improvisation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Still, it serves a purpose: to keep
the door ajar for reintegration into international cooperation on the
Arctic, while building leverage to demand it on Moscow's terms. At the
same time, its ambiguity on issues such as China allows Russia to remain
open to unexpected opportunities for a full reset of Arctic geopolitics.
[[Should negotiations with the US succeed Russia could leverage a
commitment to reducing its (exaggerated) cooperation with China and
India, for example, for tangible gains elsewhere---]{.mark}most notably
in Ukraine.]{.underline} How Europe can freeze Russia's ambitions
[Despite the pressure of international sanctions and the war in Ukraine,
[Russia has not abandoned its Arctic ambitions]{.mark}.]{.underline} On
the contrary, [the Kremlin has made the region a geopolitical
priority]{.underline}. As this paper has laid out, it is directing
significant political attention and financial resources to Arctic
development that will yield results in years to come. [Even if these
efforts remain plagued by structural inefficiencies, corruption,
intra-elite rivalries and the inherent difficulties of operating in
extreme climates, they will nonetheless expand Russia's presence and
capabilities in ways that directly threaten Western security interests.
Russia's Arctic posture under Patrushev]{.underline}, [combined with
America's assertiveness, may create a new theatre of
competition]{.underline} in a region where Europe risks being sidelined
or worse, caught in the middle. To avoid being squeezed between two more
aggressive actors, Europe's Arctic states cannot afford to go it alone.
Rather they must work together with the EU and other member states to
anticipate this shift and develop contingency strategies now. This
should include strengthening cooperation with like-minded Arctic and
non-Arctic states and situating the Kremlin's approach within its wider
geopolitical strategy, most notably in Ukraine. Strengthen cooperation
with like-minded Arctic states The EU and European governments should
pursue greater collaboration with Canada---a close ally that shares
European interests in sustainability and rules-based governance. Such
collaboration could be especially useful in reinforcing Europeans' voice
and agency in Arctic diplomacy. To make this new cooperation more
impactful, the EU and its member states should broaden their traditional
agenda with Ottawa beyond climate and Indigenous issues to include more
defence policy. The new Canadian government which is more focused on
Europe provides strong momentum. One way to deepen collaboration would
be for the members of Nordic Defence Cooperation (NORDEFCO)---a
framework that currently includes Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and
Sweden---to push for Canada's partial inclusion. Or, at minimum, they
could develop structured defence dialogues with Ottawa focused on
northern security, including more frequent joint patrols of Arctic
waters. Europeans should also consider publicly backing Canada's legal
position in its shelf demarcation dispute with America, following
Washington's unilateral claim in 2023. A coordinated EU--Canada approach
could prevent both sides being sidelined in the event of a US--Russia
potential deal over the region's future. Such a deal might see
Washington and Moscow renew trade cooperation in the Arctic and support
each other's non-conflicting claims to the Arctic shelf, which would
ignore both European and Canadian interests. In this context, EU member
states should deepen defence cooperation with Greenland and Iceland,
focusing on Arctic security through frameworks like NORDEFCO, rather
than relying solely on NATO, whose cohesion is increasingly uncertain.
Moreover, countries in the GIUK gap (Greenland, Iceland and the United
Kingdom) together with EU partners should strengthen their joint
capabilities, especially because the corridor is used for detecting
Russian naval and submarine movements, and monitoring undersea
infrastructure. To do so, a portion of the EU's proposed €800bn defence
package should be earmarked for Arctic-specific initiatives, including
infrastructure and surveillance systems. Enhanced European engagement in
the GIUK gap might also entice the US as the area serves as a critical
buffer against Russian maritime activity. Maintain limited and
structured engagement with Russia in the Arctic Council Despite the
rupture in relations following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
including the near collapse of the Arctic Council, it remains in
Europeans' interest to preserve a functional channel of communication
with Russia through the council to help prevent its withdrawal. With the
Kingdom of Denmark taking over the chairship in May 2025, it should aim
to replicate Norway's cautious strategy: keeping Russia engaged in
selected formats without full normalisation until the war in Ukraine is
over. And, given Moscow's appointment of Nikolai Korchunov as its
ambassador in Oslo, Norway is well placed to play an intermediary role
between Russia and Europe on Arctic policy. More importantly, some
engagement with Russia in the Arctic Council may dissuade
[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} from [[establishing a parallel
bilateral Arctic track with Moscow or allowing a temporary US-Russia
thaw under Trump to take institutional form]{.underline}]{.mark}. If
such a channel materialised, it [[could strengthen Moscow's efforts
to]{.mark} build a real "Polar Council" that includes non-Western states
and the US and excludes European countries and Canada, turning a
Potemkin construct into a viable alternative]{.underline}. Such a
deal---driven by the imperial ambitions of both Washington and
Moscow---would further erode Europe's influence in the region and
undermine the cohesion of Western Arctic strategy. Counterbalance
Sino-Russian posturing by engaging non-Arctic states Although Russia
frequently showcases its alignment with China on Arctic issues, the
cooperation is shallow and hampered by deep strategic mistrust. Russia
treats the Arctic as a national-security-dominated space and offers
China only tightly controlled access to projects. In contrast, Beijing
seeks a more open framework aligned with its own Arctic interests of
economic dominance and expanded global influence. To avoid being boxed
in, Moscow is now deliberately courting India as a balancing partner.
Europeans should do the same, using their developing cooperation with
India, both at the EU level and through the effective bilateral
relations between Delhi and Paris and Delhi and Berlin. These efforts
should focus on expanding cooperation with India in scientific research,
Arctic logistics and green development could serve as a strategic hedge
against Chinese and Russian ambitions and help stabilise the emerging
multipolar Arctic order. The European Commission and EU member states
should also build stronger ties with other Indo-Pacific actors,
particularly Japan and South Korea. These countries have advanced
capabilities in Arctic science, shipping and climate resilience, which
makes them valuable partners in safeguarding a rules-based Arctic
governance model. [[Understand the Arctic as a bargaining chip]{.mark}
in the Kremlin's wider geopolitical strategy Moscow is]{.underline}
increasingly linking its Arctic diplomacy to its broader war-and-peace
calculus on Ukraine[. Early signs of US attempts to broker a political
resolution to the war have reignited [the Kremlin]{.mark}]{.underline}'s
[[hopes for a "grand bargain", in which symbolic Arctic
concessions---such as]{.underline}]{.mark} downplaying Chinese
involvement or [[reengaging with Western formats]{.mark}---[could be
exchanged for more substantive gains]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine and
beyond[.]{.underline} Europeans must be ready for this tactic and
[[avoid mistaking performative gestures for real policy
shifts]{.underline}]{.mark}. In particular, [[the Kremlin is likely to
court]{.underline}]{.mark} Western---especially [[American---interest in
selective Arctic cooperation]{.mark}, using promises of investment
access to seek sanctions relief.]{.underline} Even if Washington
engages, European leaders should remain firm and sceptical of such
overtures and [remind Trump that illusions of [Russia's flexibility in
the Arctic could be used to obscure continued intransigence
elsewhere]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even though Europeans have so far had
little say in the Ukraine negotiation process compared to the US, they
still hold some sway in their own right. Europeans should use this to
distinguish between genuine strategic threats and the Kremlin's
performative signals intended to pressure the West into restoring
cooperation. Despite its rhetoric, [Russia is unlikely to withdraw from
multilateral Arctic frameworks or abandon UNCLOS
mechanisms---particularly its shelf extension claims---unless Western
countries move to politicise these processes, for example by stalling
Russia's submissions due to sanctions.]{.underline} Moscow's underlying
objective is likely to restore pre-2022 formats of Arctic cooperation,
particularly within the Arctic Council, and thus rehabilitate its
international standing without altering its behaviour in Ukraine.
Europeans must therefore be clear that no return to "business as usual"
in Arctic governance is acceptable without a ceasefire or durable
settlement to the conflict. On thin ice [[The Kremlin is investing
heavily in the Arctic and will]{.mark} continue to do so]{.underline}.
In the dreams of [Russia's leaders]{.underline}, they [will [sit down
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the West---mostly with [[the US]{.mark}---and
renegotiate the world order in their favour. They will likely try [to
sell illusory concessions in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, among
others, [while sacrificing nothing of principle in order to gain in
Ukraine]{.underline}. Europeans must not underestimate Russia's
continued military build-up in the Arctic, which---despite pressures
elsewhere---remains a long-term Kremlin priority. Instead, they must
track these developments and prepare a coherent NATO-based response,
independent of shifting US leadership and Moscow's thin veil of
concessions.

[[Calls for]{.underline}]{.mark} some kind of
**[[compromise]{.underline}]{.mark}** peace with the Kremlin
[[reflect]{.underline}]{.mark} a [fundamental [misunderstanding
of]{.mark} the [motives]{.mark} driving Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
[Putin]{.mark}'s primary goal is not to add yet more land
to]{.underline} the vastness of the [Russia]{.underline}n Federation [or
to secure his country's borders against military attack.]{.underline}
Instead, [he sees the war in civilizational terms, and [aims to
prevent]{.mark} the consolidation of [a]{.mark} democratic [Ukrainian
state]{.mark}]{.underline} on his doorstep that could inspire calls for
similar change inside Russia itself.

[Putin]{.underline} is haunted by the collapse of the USSR and [has
spent]{.underline} much of [his political career trying to reverse the
verdict of 1991]{.underline}. As a young KGB officer in East Germany, he
personally witnessed the fall of the Soviet Empire as people power
movements swept across Eastern Europe. Throughout his reign, Putin has
been obsessed with the idea that Ukraine's democratic transformation
could spark a new chapter in Russia's retreat from empire.

With this in mind, merely claiming twenty percent of Ukrainian land will
not suffice. [In order for Putin to view his invasion as a success,
Ukraine must become either an obedient Russian region or a failed
state.]{.underline} It cannot be allowed to continue in its present form
or advance further toward Euro-Atlantic integration.

[Nor is there any guarantee that Putin's expansionist ambitions will end
at the western borders of Ukraine.]{.underline} If the current invasion
leads to [a Kremlin-friendly settlement, [Putin will]{.mark} inevitably
[be encouraged to go further]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such
circumstances, his [immediate objective would be to rearm and complete
the conquest of Ukraine.]{.underline} Within a matter of years,
[**[NATO]{.mark}** countries could find themselves [**confronted by** a
resurgent]{.mark} and [combat-tested **Russia**]{.mark}n military on
their eastern flank]{.underline}.

Putin has often spoken of his regret at the breakup of the Soviet Union,
which he has referred to as "the disintegration of historical Russia."
In similar fashion, he also claims to be returning "historically Russian
lands" in Ukraine. If the present invasion does not end in defeat, who
can guarantee that [Putin's [revanchist claims will]{.mark}]{.underline}
not [[expand to include]{.underline}]{.mark} the many [[other]{.mark}
"historically Russian" [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
neighborhood?

The idea that the West can disengage from Ukraine without undermining
international security is a dangerous fantasy. [[Signs
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Western [[weakness]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Ukraine have already [visibly]{.underline}
[**[embolden]{.mark}**ed]{.underline} [[Russia. Other]{.mark}
authoritarian [states including China, Iran, and]{.mark}
**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea [are watching]{.mark}
closely]{.underline}. Any attempt to push Kyiv into accepting Putin's
terms would shatter the West's claim to global leadership, while greatly
strengthening the position of Russia and its autocratic allies.

More than two and a half years after Moscow launched the largest
European invasion since World War II, it should now be abundantly clear
that [Russia will not stop]{.underline} until it is stopped. Any
shortsighted [attempts to appease]{.underline} Putin [with
[compromises]{.mark}]{.underline} that reward his invasion [will
[inevitably backfire and fuel more]{.mark} Russian
[aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instead, the West must recognize that
the only way to achieve a sustainable peace is by committing fully to
Ukrainian victory.

#### Increased Russian aggression guarantees nuclear use. Russian nuclear doctrine ensures nuclear escalation

**Schneider 2025**. Dr. Schneider is a Senior Analyst with the National
Institute for Public Policy. "The Implications of Russia's New Nuclear
Doctrine" National Institute for Public Policy No. 615, February 5,

Accessed 7/7/25. ARJSH

The new provisions in the 2024 version seem to reflect the changes in
Russian foreign and military policy resulting from its ill-conceived
2022 invasion of Ukraine and its subsequent military setbacks. Despite
this, Putin has not given up. [[Russian nuclear doctrine]{.mark} is
important because it [shapes Russian military
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is also [intended to be intimidating
to the West]{.underline} because Putin believes that the use of nuclear
threats enhances Russian political clout. Indeed, as far back as July
2014, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made a nuclear threat
relating to Russia's seizure of Crimea by referencing Russia's nuclear
doctrine.\[5\] He was apparently speaking about the real version, not
what had been publicly revealed. The version made public in 2024 is
clearly more consistent with what Lavrov was saying. Former President
Obama's Ambassador to NATO has concluded that Russia's nuclear threats
have indeed effectively intimidated Washington.\[6\] [An important "new"
element [in]{.mark} the Russian [2024]{.mark} nuclear doctrine is [the
asserted right to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear
state]{.mark} that is being assisted by a nuclear
power]{.underline}.\[7\] The provision reads, ["Aggression against the
Russian Federation and (or) its allies by any non-nuclear state with the
participation or support of a nuclear state is considered as their joint
attack]{.underline}."\[8\] Russian expatriate Pavel Podvig points out
that this goes back to 1995.\[9\] However, what is really new is that
this is now being applied to non-nuclear states that have been attacked
by Russia and are being assisted by the United States, the United
Kingdom, France and other NATO nations that are providing weapons to
resist Russian aggression. [This constitutes [a major]{.mark} de facto
[expansion]{.mark} of what started out as an exception [to]{.mark}
Russia's policy of "negative assurances," i.e., that it would not [use
nuclear weapons]{.mark} against non-nuclear states.\[10\]]{.underline}
The most explicit statement of Russia's 2024 nuclear doctrine concerning
nuclear weapons first use comes in paragraph 19, which goes
significantly beyond the 2020 version. It states that: 19. The
conditions that enable the possibility of nuclear weapons employment by
the Russian Federation are as follows: a) receipt of reliable data on
the launch of ballistic missiles attacking the territories of the
Russian Federation and (or) its allies; b) employment of nuclear or
other types of weapons of mass destruction by an adversary against the
territories of the Russian Federation and (or) its allies, against
facilities and (or) military formations of the Russian Federation
located outside its territory; c) actions by an adversary affecting
elements of critically important state or military infrastructure of the
Russian Federation, the disablement of which would disrupt response
actions by nuclear forces; d) aggression against the Russian Federation
and (or) the Republic of Belarus as participants in the Union State with
the employment of conventional weapons, which creates a critical threat
to their sovereignty and (or) territorial integrity; e) receipt of
reliable data on the massive launch (take-off) of air and space attack
means (strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, unmanned,
hypersonic and other aerial vehicles) and their crossing of the state
border of the Russian Federation.\[11\] An important element of Russia's
2024 nuclear doctrine that has been largely ignored in Western
commentary is the repeated assertion that [[nuclear weapons can be used
first in response to "...aggression]{.mark} against the Russian
Federation]{.underline} and (or) the Republic of Belarus as participants
in the Union State with the employment of conventional weapons, which
creates a critical threat to their sovereignty and (or) territorial
integrity;..."\[12\] The overt inclusion of Belarus (which is not
threatened by anyone) is new. Linking nuclear weapons first use to
sovereignty and territorial integrity is not new. In 2012, Putin
declared, "The nuclear weapons remain the most important guarantee of
Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and play a key role in
maintaining the regional balance and stability."\[13\] Linking Russian
nuclear weapons first use to undefined threats to Russia's sovereignty
and territorial integrity first officially appeared in paragraph 4 of
the 2020 version of Russia's nuclear doctrine.\[14\] Prior to 2020, this
had been reported in Russian state media as part of Russian nuclear
doctrine and it was included in statements by Russian leaders making
nuclear threats.\[15\] It now appears in paragraphs 4, 18 and 19 of the
new version.\[16\] [The increased emphasis is significant because [the
concept is]{.mark} potentially [very permissive regarding nuclear
weapons first use]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [President Putin has
characterized cyber espionage (not cyber-attack) as "a direct violation
of the state's sovereignty]{.underline}...."\[17\] In addition, prior to
2020, treatment of nuclear first use in Russia's military doctrine
publications was very limited. The 2010 and 2014 versions of Russian
military doctrine spoke about nuclear weapons first use in situations
when the "very existence of the state is in jeopardy."\[18\] This
language was a deceptive effort to make Russian nuclear doctrine appear
more benign than it actually was---perhaps in response to President
Barack Obama's vocal advocacy of "nuclear zero." Escalate-to-Deescalate
[The critical, underlying concept that probably is elaborated in all of
the classified versions of Russia's nuclear doctrine is the so-called
"[escalate-to-deescalate]{.mark}]{.underline}" strategy which is based
on the notion that the United States would be paralyzed in the face of
Moscow's first use threats and [the dangerous belief that Russia would
win a war if it initiated the use of nuclear weapons]{.underline}.\[19\]
A 2003 Russian Defense Ministry publication said, "Deescalation of
aggression is forcing the enemy to halt military action by a threat to
deliver or by actual delivery of strikes of varying intensity with
reliance on conventional and (or) nuclear weapons."\[20\] In 2017,
then-DIA Director Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart stated that Russia
is "...the only country that I know of that has this concept of escalate
to terminate or escalate to deescalate but they do have that built into
their operational concept, we've seen them exercise that idea and it's
really kind of a dangerous idea..."\[21\] According to Russia expert Dr.
Stephen Blank, "...[arguably \[[escalation dominance\] is merely a part
of a much broader nuclear strategy]{.mark} that relies heavily upon the
psychological and intimidating component of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}."\[22\] Nuclear Escalation in Russia's Theater War
Exercises The classified Russian documents discussed by the Financial
Times in February 2024 (which it said dated from 2008 to 2014\[23\])
indicate that in its theater war exercises Russia displayed "...[[a
threshold for using tactical nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[is]{.mark} [lower than]{.mark} Russia has [ever]{.mark} publicly
admitted]{.underline}, according to experts who reviewed and verified
the documents."\[24\] This [included the use of tactical nuclear weapons
for "fear inducement."]{.underline} Nuclear targeting even included
Russian allies---China, North Korea, Iran, and Azerbaijan.\[25\] One of
the documents indicated that nuclear weapons first use was permissible
if there was "...an enemy landing on Russian territory" or "the defeat
of units responsible for securing border areas..."\[26\] This clearly
goes beyond the language in the 2020 edition and seems to imply a lower
nuclear first use threshold than even the language in the 2024 version.
[Using Nuclear Escalation Threats to Deter Conventional
Retaliation]{.underline} Against Russia The language in the 2024 Russian
document provides further evidence that [it is trying to establish a
norm in which it can initiate a war, launch devastating conventional
attacks on adversary infrastructure and expect no comparable retaliation
because of the threat of Russian nuclear escalation]{.underline}. This
is clearly the case in subparagraph 19(e) of Russia's 2024 nuclear
doctrine (which is new language) which states that nuclear escalation
could occur in response to the "...receipt of reliable data on the
massive launch (take-off) of air and space attack means (strategic and
tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, unmanned, hypersonic and other
aerial vehicles) and their crossing of the state border of the Russian
Federation."\[27\] What is described is the manner in which modern
"non-contact" conventional warfare is conducted. This is the way Russia
initiated its war against Ukraine in 2022. The publication of the 2024
Russian nuclear doctrine is part of an orchestrated effort to deter
attacks on its territory with weapons provided to Ukraine from the
United States and other NATO nations. [The main objective of the
doctrine relates to a war with NATO within a decade for which Russian
leaders have recently stated Russia is preparing.]{.underline}\[28\] [If
Russia successfully imposes such a limitation on targeting, it virtually
guarantees a Russian victory, and this will likely result in its
initiating a major war against the West with possible nuclear
escalation.]{.underline} This is very important because of the gradual
emergence of a fascist state in Russia, the process of which is being
accelerated by Putin's war against Ukraine.\[29\] Right now, Putin's
Russia is closer to Mussolini's version of fascism than Hitler's. Both
versions embraced the right of military expansion based upon supposed
grievances and historical legitimacy. Lacking the utopian vision of
Communism, the only rationale for Putin's expansion of the Russian
empire is historical grievance and the ability to do so. [Since Russia's
conventional military power is limited, [it uses nuclear
coercion]{.mark} for that purpose, and may engage in [nuclear
escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Putin has recently said that [[Russia
has the "largest arsenals of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}."\[30\] [Putin disguises his imperialism by
advocating the creation of a "new world order" which seeks to protect
the world from the evil West.31\] However, this "new world order" is
blatant imperialism.]{.underline} Russian Nuclear Threats and Putin's
Confrontation with the West [Putin's war against Ukraine is not
isolated. It is part of a strategy of forcing the West to acquiesce to
Russian imperial domination]{.underline} of the former Soviet and Warsaw
Pact states. [Putin's "splendid little war" against Ukraine was intended
to demonstrate Russian military prowess]{.underline} in the hope that it
would result in the rupture of the NATO alliance and, ultimately,
Western capitulation. The West should not forget the ultimatums
concerning "security guarantees" that Putin delivered to NATO and the
United States just before his invasion of Ukraine.\[32\] [Associated
with Putin's ultimatums were unprecedented threats of war and nuclear
war]{.underline}.\[33\] Former CIA officer Rob Dannenberg has summed up
the implications of the "security guarantees" demanded by Putin: In the
aggregate, if accepted, the Russian proposals would create a massive
"buffer zone" or \[Russian\] "sphere of influence" from Finland in the
north to Turkey in the south, in some ways replicating the 1945 Yalta
Agreement. The manner in which the Russian proposals have been presented
and subsequent comments from senior Russian officials suggest the two
draft treaties are not proposals subject to negotiation and discussion
but rather demands. Per Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov: "If the
West does not deliver a constructive answer \[to Russia's demands\]
within a reasonable time frame...then Russia will be forced to use all
necessary means to ensure the strategic balance and to eradicate threats
to our security," adding that "Russia will not allow never-ending
discussions" on its demands.\[34\] While Russia's military weakness and
incompetence have demonstrated the opposite of what Putin intended,
Russia has learned from its failures\[35\] and has gradually adopted a
new strategy of winning through callous disregard for casualties.\[36\]
(The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence estimates that Russia has
suffered 760,000 casualties in the Ukraine War.\[37\]) [One of the most
dangerous aspects of this bloody conflict is that the Russian people
have demonstrated a willingness to allow Putin to kill and maim a
generation of Russians to achieve his goal of imperial
expansion]{.underline}. Additionally, [Russia has about doubled military
spending at the expense of the well-being of the Russian people.\[38\]
This increase in military spending may well continue in the post-Ukraine
war period.]{.underline} President [[Putin will likely eventually use
nuclear weapons unless he is deterred. Putin may blunder into a war with
NATO given his commitment to nuclear coercion]{.mark} and nuclear
superiority]{.underline}. [[Or, he may launch nuclear first use
intentionally. The temptation to use nuclear weapons may override the
risks]{.mark}. Russia's new nuclear doctrine gives us more insight into
Russia's planning, which is threatening and dangerous.]{.underline}

On 24 February 2022, [Russian forces invaded Ukraine]{.underline}. What
Russia's president Vladimir Putin called a "special military operation"

violated international law.]{.underline} At this time, Russia was in the
middle of its chairship period of the Arctic Council. As of March 2022[,
the seven other member states paused their participation in the
Council's activities and its subsidiary bodies]{.underline}. On 11 May
2023, under the Norwegian chairship, which succeeded the Russian one,
certain cooperative activities were restored. But how, and why, did the
Arctic Council survive the immediate crisis stemming from Russia's
invasion of Ukraine? [[After the]{.mark} start of the [invasion, Arctic
cooperation, including scientific exchange, was significantly hampered.
The crisis]{.mark} affected the translation of knowledge and
[weakened]{.mark} established [international researcher networks]{.mark}

back debates [about [whether cooperating with Russia in the Arctic could
continue to be an exception]{.mark} to the tense relations with the
country in other realms,]{.underline} even raising the specter of the
end of Arctic exceptionalism. Collaboration within the Arctic Council is
built upon international laws and mutual recognition of state
sovereignty. [Russia's actions thusraised a core concern: How can the
seven Arctic nations collaborate with a country that had challenged the
principles on which their intergovernmental cooperation was
founded?]{.underline} How did the Arctic Council survive? On 3 March
2022, [[the seven Western Arctic states issued a joint statement
condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and temporarily paused their
activities within the Council]{.underline}]{.mark}. This disruption also
found place in other fora like the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, from
which Russia withdrew its participation, and the Council of the Baltic
Sea States, from which Russia was suspended. The discussions within the
Arctic Council at the political level were largely confidential, and did
not always include permanent participants in decision-making processes.
In May 2022, Norway confirmed that it would proceed with preparations
for its upcoming chairship period despite the ongoing pause. [The
following June, the "Arctic seven]{.underline}"---the western AC member
states---[issued a statement signaling partial resumption of AC work
without Russian involvement]{.underline}. This action attracted media
attention, adding traction to debates about the Council's prospects,
which seemed bleak at the time. The Arctic Circle Assembly in October
2022 was, however, a turning point. Among those closely involved with
the Arctic Council, the approach had been to avoid public discussions
about its survival to prevent further speculation as to the body's
future. But after the Arctic Circle Assembly, leaders deemed it
necessary to assert the Council's relevance and demonstrate the
commitment of all Arctic states to its continued survival.

Recent experience in the Pacific suggests that [the US or Nato will seek
to assert rights of navigation under the UN convention on the law of the
sea. This is inherently risky. Russia could see such attempts to declare
freedom of navigation as a provocation]{.underline}. But failure to
enforce these freedoms carries an opposite risk: without maintaining a
presence in the region, Nato members would be allowing Russia's new law
to become normalised. A careful balancing act is essential to maintain
presence and not allow Russia to close off this region of the Arctic as
its private domain. [[Moscow sees Nato borders
expanding]{.underline}]{.mark}. It fears encirclement. Its experience of
humiliation in Ukraine has increased this tension. Two Arctic brigades
have been deployed to Ukraine with disastrous consequences; the
Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies estimates that more than 1,000
personnel have been lost. As Russia's conventional land forces have been
depleted in the Arctic, the Kremlin will turn to its naval and submarine
capacity. The potential to inflict damage to undersea cables and
pipelines is a lever that Putin could use against his opponents. [At the
moment, [it seems our politicians are not looking beyond the Ukraine
war. They need to]{.mark}. A weakened and resentful Russia does not make
for a stable global order. [We have already seen Putin pivot to China
and use the Arctic as a bargaining chip]{.mark} to strengthen that
relationship.]{.underline} It is scarcely a month since the two
countries' coastguards signed a memorandum in Murmansk about cooperation
in the Arctic. China's price for providing Russia with support over
Ukraine could be requesting naval access to Russian bases in the Arctic.

Why Now? Eroding Extended Deterrence Is Likely the Key

If the stability-instability paradox has raised its ugly head in
Ukraine, then the key question is, why now? [What has changed from
previous nuclear history?]{.underline} After all, Washington and Moscow
have the same MAD deterrence relationship as always. Moreover, while one
or the other had a strategic advantage at different times during the
Cold War, these [strategic imbalances were never sufficient to alter the
fundamental MAD stalemate]{.underline}. Putin may boast about his new
strategic weapons, but MAD nonetheless prevails.13 Yes, these
[new-fangled [Russian doomsday systems]{.mark} [can]{.mark} doubtless
[destroy **America**]{.mark}n society [many times
over]{.mark}]{.underline}, but America's aging strategic arsenal can
still pay back in kind. In this sense, nothing important has really
changed vis-à-vis strategic stability relative to the situation that has
prevailed since at least the mid-1960s.14

[What has changed dramatically]{.underline} since the Cold War's end,
however, [is]{.underline} the [imbalance in sub-strategic nuclear
forces]{.underline}. Unlike in the past, [[Russia]{.mark} now
[boasts]{.mark} a major quantitative and qualitative [sub-strategic
advantage]{.mark} over the United States.]{.underline} Its deployments
include short-range tactical weapons to intermediate-range nuclear
missiles. [**Russia** also has **[embraced]{.mark}** an [aggressive
**nuclear first-use**]{.mark} doctrine that envisions using these
sub-strategic weapons [to "**escalate to deescalate**]{.mark}" if it
ever faces defeat from NATO's superior conventional
forces]{.underline}.15 Ironically, perhaps, this is precisely how NATO
planned to use such weapons during the Cold War, when the Soviets
enjoyed conventional superiority. In addition, NATO's plan was to
provide credible extended deterrence (that is, deterring aggression at
lower levels, especially against US allies). In other words,
sub-strategic nuclear forces have always played a key role in making
deterrence credible against lower-level threats by making nuclear
escalation more credible where strategic retaliation would be suicidal
overkill. While historically true for both sides, now [[Russia has clear
escalation dominance]{.mark} over the United States at these lower
nuclear levels]{.underline}. This situation is not new; however, until
recently, it did not much matter in the absence of serious geopolitical
and geostrategic rivalry.

Unlike its present deterrence posture that relies mostly on conventional
and strategic nuclear forces, the United States actively sought to
mitigate the conditions for a stability-instability paradox in the first
Cold War. Deterrence planners worried about how to deter not only a
large-scale conventional attack against NATO countries, but also
peripheral scenarios like the "Hamburg Grab." In that imagined scenario,
Soviets might seize and cut off a single vulnerable city.16 Again, the
answer to deterring these relatively peripheral threats was to make
nuclear escalation more credible by deploying non-strategic nuclear
weapons, down to short-range, low-yield tactical battlefield systems.
This idea amounted to a fusing of the stable MAD deterrence ideas of
foreign policy expert Thomas Schelling and the escalation management
deterrence ideas of Herman Kahn.17 Hence, US nuclear strategy in the
Cold War embraced a hybrid over/under deterrence approach that relied on
preserving a stable strategic balance, underpinned by an escalation
spectrum that no longer exists for the United States.

It is possible that Snyder's worry may always have been valid, but that
deliberate and effective steps were taken to avert it by using
sub-strategic nuclear forces to extend the effectiveness of deterrence
below the MAD standoff. Thus, the dramatic [[imbalance]{.mark} that now
prevails [at]{.mark} these [low]{.mark}er deterrence [levels]{.mark} to
Russia's advantage could [have been]{.mark} a [key]{.mark} factor
[affecting]{.mark} Putin's [willingness to engage in]{.mark} military
[adventurism]{.mark}]{.underline}. This might be the case, [despite
NATO's superior conventional forces]{.underline} and the threat of MAD
afforded by the combined strategic nuclear forces of the United States,
Britain, and France. In contemplating a move against Ukraine,
[Putin]{.underline} may have [assessed]{.underline} that [Russian
sub-strategic dominance put him in the catbird seat by [allowing him to
threaten nuclear reprisal from a position of]{.mark} clear [**escalation
dominance**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia's conventional military
difficulties notwithstanding, [he arguably may already have been proven
correct.]{.underline}

How extreme is today's sub-strategic escalation imbalance? Other than
nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) carried by strategic
bombers, the United States is believed to deploy only about 100 outdated
nuclear gravity bombs for NATO nuclear warfighting missions.18 Russia,
by contrast, is thought to deploy thousands of land- and sea-based
sub-strategic nuclear bombs and missiles, ranging from short to
intermediate ranges, and these numbers are growing.19 For its part,
China possesses an overwhelming advantage over Russia in land-based,
intermediate-range, nuclear-capable missiles---previously banned by the
Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between Moscow and Washington.
The United States has none at all. Although China is not thought to
possess a significant tactical nuclear advantage, it probably has a
local advantage. Moreover, some studies suggest that China may increase
the integration of tactical nuclear systems into its military doctrine
and posture going forward.20 As one recent study convincingly argues,
the overall sub-strategic imbalance offers escalation pathways to Russia
and China that are unavailable to the United States.21

In sum, American sub-strategic disarmament in conjunction with Russian
and Chinese sub-strategic armament has fostered the ideal circumstances
for an operative stability-instability paradox, given the recent return
of virulent geopolitical, geostrategic, and ideological competition with
the United States and its allies.

### AT: Russia's Weak

#### Russian military is resilient and bouncing back -- direct and indirect threat 

- Emboldens China, Iran, NoKo

- Counters NATO Deterrence

[The question is]{.underline} [not whether [Russia]{.mark} will pose a
threat]{.underline} to the United States and its allies [but how to
assess the magnitude of the danger and the effort required to contain
it]{.underline}. China will remain the United States' primary
competitor. But even with much of its attention called to Asia,
Washington cannot ignore [a recalcitrant and revanchist adversary in
Europe]{.underline}, especially not one [that [will pose a
direct]{.mark} military [threat]{.mark} to NATO members.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} Russian [problem is]{.mark}]{.underline} also a
**[[global]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. [Putin's willingness to invade a
neighbor, assault democratic societies, and generally violate accepted
norms]{.underline}---[and]{.underline} his seeming ability to [get away
with it]{.underline}---[paves the way for others to do the
same]{.underline}. The [Kremlin's [provision]{.mark} of military
equipment and know-how [to]{.mark} current and aspiring U.S.
[adversaries will amplify]{.mark} these [threats]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[multiplying]{.mark} the [challenges]{.mark} that Washington will face
[from **China, Iran**, **No**]{.mark}rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea, and any
other country that Russia backs.]{.underline}

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
Europe]{.underline}, therefore, [must invest in resisting Russia now or
pay a far greater cost later. The]{.underline} incoming Trump
[administration]{.underline}, in particular, [does not have the luxury
of shoving Russia down its list of policy]{.underline}
[priorities]{.underline}. If [Putin]{.underline} sees Washington doing
so, he [will grow]{.underline} only [more brazen and
ambitious]{.underline} in his efforts to weaken the United States and
its allies, both directly and [through the axis of upheaval that Russia
supports]{.underline}. To prevent that outcome, Washington and its
allies must help Ukraine strengthen its position ahead of negotiations
to end the current war. The United States is right to prioritize China,
but in order to effectively compete with Beijing, it first needs to set
European security on the right path. Washington must remain the primary
enabler of that security for now, while making sure that Europe ramps up
the investments required to better handle its own defense in the years
ahead. By taking the steps necessary to counter Russia today, the United
States and Europe can ensure that the threat they face tomorrow will be
a manageable one.

IN TOO DEEP

P[utin has changed Russia in ways that will ensure it remains a
challenge to the West as long as he is in power and likely well
beyond]{.underline}. [Confrontation is now the hallmark of Russia's
foreign policy]{.underline}, with Putin [citing]{.underline} his
country's "[existential struggle" with the West]{.underline} to justify
his regime and its actions. This idea of a [Russian civilization in
constant conflict with its Western foes strengthens the ideological
foundation of his rule---a source of legitimacy he now needs to
safeguard his hold on power.]{.underline}

Putin's increased reliance on repression has generated risks to the
stability of his regime. Political science research shows that
repression is effective in the sense that it increases autocrats'
longevity in office. But depending too heavily on it, as Putin has done,
can raise the prospect that leaders will make destabilizing mistakes.
Heavy-handed tactics compel people to mask their private views and avoid
sharing anything but what the government wants to hear, which means the
autocrat, too, loses access to accurate information. High levels of
repression also create a rising reservoir of general dissatisfaction, so
that even a small outburst of discontent can quickly spiral into trouble
for the regime. To mitigate these risks and reinforce his hold on power,
Putin has used his control over the information environment to convince
the Russian people that their country is at war with a West that wants
to break it apart.

[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} has also [**[reoriented the]{.mark}**
Russian **[economy around]{.mark}** his **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Russia's defense spending is set to reach its highest point since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, with \$145 billion allocated in the 2025
budget]{.underline}---the equivalent of [6.3 percent of GDP and more
than double the \$66 billion Russia budgeted for defense in
2021]{.underline}, the [year before the invasion]{.underline}. And the
[true amount of such spending will likely be higher,]{.underline}
possibly **[[exceeding eight percent of GDP]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[once other, unofficial forms of defense-related expenditures are
accounted for. (]{.underline}When also adjusting for considerable
differences in purchasing power parity between Russia and the United
States, [Russia's actual defense spending is much higher than \$145
billion, exceeding \$200 billion]{.underline}.) Russian [factories
producing military equipment have added shifts to increase production;
workers have moved from civilian to military sectors, where the wages
are higher;]{.underline} and [payouts for military service have
skyrocketed]{.underline}. The war has become a wealth transfer mechanism
channeling money to Russia's poor regions, and many [economic
elites]{.underline} have [moved into the defense sector]{.underline} to
cash in on lucrative opportunities. [Elites]{.underline} have, by now,
[adjusted to the system's current configuration, enabling them not just
to survive but to profit from it.]{.underline}

Having gone through the pain of shifting the economy to a wartime
footing and feeling the pressure of new vested interests, [Putin is
unlikely to undo these changes quickly]{.underline}. After the fighting
in Ukraine ends, [he will]{.underline} probably instead [look to
justify]{.underline} the [continuation of the wartime
economy]{.underline}. Such was the inclination of Soviet leader Joseph
Stalin, who, after the Allied victory in World War II, soon began to
speak of Moscow's new five-year plans as necessary preparation for the
next inevitable war.

Russian foreign policy is also transforming in ways that will be
difficult to undo. The **[[invasion]{.mark} of Ukraine has [made it
impossible]{.mark} for Russia [to build ties with the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and Moscow has had to look for
opportunities elsewhere]{.underline}. Its [deepening partnerships with
China, Iran, and North Korea may have been driven largely by necessity:
Russia needs their help to sustain its economy and warfighting
machine.]{.underline} But [Moscow]{.underline} also [understands that by
working with these countries]{.underline}, [it is in a better position
to sustain a long-term competition with the United States and its
allies.]{.underline} Not only does their support make Russia less
isolated and less vulnerable to the United States' tools of economic
warfare; [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[benefits
from]{.underline}]{.mark} having [[cobelligerents]{.mark} working in
tandem to weaken the West]{.underline}. The [Kremlin]{.underline} has
gone all in on these partnerships, having [abandoned caution in
cooperating with North Korea]{.underline}, overcome its concern with
overdependence on [China]{.underline}, [and elevated relations with
Iran]{.underline} beyond transactional engagement. All of this amounts
to a new strategy for Moscow, one that will not simply disappear after
the fighting in Ukraine subsides or ends.

RUSSIA RELOADS

[Russia's military threat is not going away]{.underline}, either. The
[question of Russian **military [reconstitution is not an if but a
when]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Even if Russia cannot sustain its current
wartime spending, the [defense budget is likely to remain substantially
above prewar levels for some time to come]{.underline}. The Russian
military, too, is [unlikely to shrink back to the]{.underline}
relatively [small army]{.underline} Russia fielded [before the
war]{.underline}. One lesson that Russia's military brass took from
Ukraine is that the Russian army was not "Soviet" enough in that it
lacked mass and the capacity to replace losses. In reality, the Russian
military was stuck in a halfway state, having acquired some advanced or
modernized capabilities but also retaining some Soviet-era
characteristics, including conscription and a culture of centralized
command that discouraged initiative. Now, [Russia is likely to maintain
a large overall force with an expanded structure and greater
manpower]{.underline} allocation, although it will still depend on
mobilization in the event of war to reduce the cost of its standing
army.

[Reconstitution is about not just materiel but also the capacity to
conduct large-scale combat operations. The **[Russia]{.mark}**n
military]{.underline} has shown that it can learn as an organization; it
[**[is capable]{.mark} [of scaling]{.mark} the [deployment of]{.mark}
[new tech]{.mark}nology such as [drones and electronic]{.mark} warfare
[systems]{.mark} onto the battlefield, [and]{.mark} it will be a changed
force after its experience in Ukraine**.]{.underline} Despite its
initial poor showing, [the Russian military has [demonstrated]{.mark}
staying power and the [ability to withstand]{.mark} high levels of
[attrition]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Russia's military reconstitution will face headwinds, especially from
the country's limited defense industrial capacity and skilled labor
shortage. Russian industry has not been able to significantly scale the
production of major platforms and weapons systems. Labor and machine
tools remain major constraints because of Western sanctions and export
controls. Russia has still been able to significantly increase the
production of missiles, precision-guided weapons, drones, and artillery
munitions, and it has set up an effective repair and refurbishment
pipeline for existing equipment. But it is also drawing from aging
stocks that it inherited from the Soviet Union for much of its land
force equipment. Thus, as it expands its forces and replaces losses, it
is depleting its resources.

From now on, [the Russian military]{.underline} will have a duality to
it, with areas of strength but equally prominent weaknesses. On the one
hand, it [[has become]{.mark} much [better at]{.mark} dynamic
[targeting]{.mark}, precision strikes, the integration of
[drones]{.mark} in combat operations, [and]{.mark} more sophisticated
methods of employing [long-range]{.mark} precision-guided
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia has adapted
to---[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} in some cases [[developed effective
tactics to counter]{.underline}]{.mark}---the [[Western
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} it confronted in Ukraine. Over time,
Russian forces [reorganized logistics and command and control, coming up
with ways to reduce the efficacy of Western equipment and intercept
Western munitions]{.underline}, [and they have learned to operate with
the presence of Western long-range precision-guided weapons,
intelligence, and targeting]{.underline}.

For [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, this ought to set off alarms. [Some
analysts argue that the way Ukraine is fighting now is not the way NATO
would fight in a potential future war with Russia. They contend
specifically that NATO would quickly earn and maintain air superiority,
changing the nature of the conflict]{.underline}. Although this may be
true, [[airpower will not solve]{.mark} every battlefield
challenge]{.underline} NATO might face. And most [European air forces
lack munitions for a sustained conventional war]{.underline}. The time
it would take to deplete their arsenals can best be measured in weeks
and in many cases days.

On the other hand, a substantial percentage of the Russian ground force
will likely continue to field dated Soviet equipment, and it will take
years to rebuild force quality and replace the officers lost in Ukraine.
The outlook for Russia's defense capacity will also depend on whether
its economy is running flat out and the defense sector has already
maximized production or if there is still room for production to
increase as new and refurbished plants and facilities come online.
Overall, the Russian military will remain a patchwork, with some parts
more advanced and capable than they were at the start of 2022 and other
parts still using equipment from the middle of the Cold War, if not
earlier. But [the chances of the Russian armed forces being decisively
knocked out and unable to pose a major threat for a prolonged period are
low.]{.underline}

### Taiwan-NATO Mod 

#### Emboldened Russia and China coordinate strikes on Taiwan and NATO territories

**Fornusek 2025.** Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv
Independent. "Russia striking NATO while China invades Taiwan
\'plausible\' scenario, experts say" Kyiv Independent. July 7, 2025.

Accessed 7/8/25. ARJSH

If Beijing moves against Taiwan, NATO might soon find itself in a
two-front war with China and Russia --- or so the alliance\'s secretary
general believes. \"[If Xi Jinping would attack Taiwan, he would first
make sure that he makes a call to his very junior partner in all of
this, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin... and telling him, \'Hey, I'm going
to do this, and I need you to to keep them busy in Europe by attacking
NATO territory]{.underline},\'\" Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a
July 5 interview with the New York Times. Such a scenario would for all
intents and purposes amount [to [a global war between nuclear
superpowers]{.mark}]{.underline}, yet many experts agree that this
scenario [[is not too far from reality.]{.mark}]{.underline} Beijing and
Moscow have tightened their alliance aimed at dethroning the U.S. as the
global superpower, a cooperation nowhere else more visible than in
Chinese support for Russia\'s war against Ukraine. In the meantime,
[NATO continues to grapple with the war in Ukraine and internal
divisions wrought by the Trump presidency. It would benefit China to
fuel this turmoil, [making sure the alliance\'s attention remains split
while Beijing pursues its own territorial
ambitions]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"[If China were to decide that
incorporating Taiwan into China by force was their only option, they
will do all they can to ensure both Europe and America have as many
dispersed challenges to deal with as possible,\"]{.underline} retired
Australian Army Major General Mick Ryan told the Kyiv Independent. China
and Russia eye a two-front war on the West According to the South China
Morning Post, China\'s Foreign Minister Wang Yi recently told the EU\'s
top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, that his country [cannot afford Russia to
lose its war against Ukraine, as it would allow the U.S. to shift its
focus on Beijing.]{.underline} This admission underscored \"[China\'s
strategic interest in depleting Western resources on the European
continent]{.underline},\" Nataliya Butyrska, an expert on East Asia at
the New Europe Center in Kyiv, told the Kyiv Independent. This goal has
also been evident in China\'s support of Russia\'s aggression against
Ukraine. The Asian power has been the leading source of dual-use goods
feeding the Russian defense industry and has helped Moscow cushion the
impact of Western sanctions. Kyiv has even accused China of directly
providing arms to Russia -- an allegation Beijing denied. Several
Chinese nationals have also been captured fighting in Ukraine within
Russian ranks. Experts have long warned that China is closely watching
Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine to learn lessons for a potential invasion
of Taiwan. But the interest is not limited to the military sphere.
\"China is closely observing the West's response to Russia's actions and
sees opportunities for itself amid a potential fracture of transatlantic
unity,\" Butyrska said. Underscoring the symbiotic nature of the
Russian-Chinese relationship, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could also
present a boon to Moscow. \"[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} wouldn't need
a request from China to keep NATO occupied; it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
more [[likely to take advantage of a Taiwan invasion by undertaking some
kind of further aggression in Europe]{.underline}]{.mark},\" Dan
Hamilton, a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian and Western officials have been
raising alarms that [[a Russian attack against NATO]{.mark}
territory]{.underline} --- for example, in the Baltics --- [is an
[increasingly plausible]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}. Camille Grand, a
security and NATO expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations,
concurred that in \"[the event of a major crisis in Asia, the Russian
Federation might indeed try to take advantage of the U.S. focused on a
Taiwanese contingency to test NATO and further challenge European
security.\"]{.underline} Even the more cautious voices do not rule out a
possible coordination between China and Russia in the case of an attack
on Taiwan. Jan Svec, a China researcher at the Prague-based Institute of
International Relations, notes that an ideal scenario for Beijing is
seizing the island by non-military means without sparking a broader
conflict with the West. However \"[if the situation escalates and the
Chinese government decides on a military invasion (which is a less
likely but also possible option), then [it would make]{.mark} some
[sense to coordinate with Russia,\"]{.mark} he told the Kyiv
Independent.]{.underline} Putin and Xi have not been shy about the
ultimate goal of their \"no-limits partnership\" --- challenging the
U.S. and Western dominance on the global stage. Such clarity seems to be
lacking in the NATO camp. U.S. President Donald Trump\'s strategy to
drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing by making overtures to Russia
has been met with skepticism from experts. The new U.S. president has
also signaled plans to reduce the U.S. military presence in Europe while
urging European partners to take up greater responsibility for their own
security, allowing Washington to shift focus to the Indo-Pacific region.
But as Hamilton notes[, [the \"North Atlantic and]{.underline}
]{.mark}[the [Indo-Pacific]{.mark} (regions) [are strategically
linked]{.mark} by the China-Russia entente]{.underline}.\" \"[NATO\'s
best contribution to this challenge is for Europeans to do more to
defend Europe so that Americans can devote more resources to the
Indo-Pacific,\"]{.underline} he adds. Allied leaders have rushed to
allay Trump\'s concerns, agreeing to ramp up the defense spending target
from 2% to 5% of GDP during a recent summit in The Hague. However, some
experts say this is far from enough to counter a united Russian-Chinese
threat. Edward Lucas, a non-resident Senior Fellow at the Center for
European Policy Analysis, agrees that a coordinated Chinese assault on
Taiwan and a Russian assault on NATO is \"all too plausible.\" \"What is
baffling to me is that NATO, having been on edge after Trump's election
victory... is slumping back into a posture of complacency,\" he told the
Kyiv Independent. Calling the new defense spending target an
\"aspiration\" rather than a reality, Lucas says that \"NATO still has
its pants down when it comes to defense and deterrence.\"

Taiwan

[[Taiwan is]{.mark} probably [the most frequently cited]{.mark}
potential [**flashpoint** between **China and the
US**]{.mark}]{.underline}.74 [[A range of triggers could prompt a
crisis]{.mark} in or around the Taiwan Strait, including a unilateral
declaration of independence from Taipei]{.underline} (fairly unlikely to
happen), [or [a decision by **Beijing** to ratchet up
**military**]{.mark}, economic and political **[pressure]{.mark}**
(including interference) [on]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} even [to
**invade**]{.mark}, [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. While some analysis of
those possibilities has tended towards alarmism (given just how
difficult and costly an invasion of Taiwan would be),75 [war over Taiwan
remains a real possibility]{.underline}.

A direct attack against Taiwan would be a dramatically escalatory first
move from China. [Were [China]{.mark} seeking to invade and occupy
Taiwan, it [would]{.mark} need to [launch]{.mark} extensive and
overwhelming [**preliminary strikes** to facilitate access for
**amphibious transports**]{.mark} and major surface
vessels]{.underline}. We could expect cyberattacks on
command-and-control infrastructure and potential antisatellite attacks
(using either physical or cyber means). Those attacks may extend to US
systems, or even to US forces based in the region.76

[The US might respond to a direct Chinese attack on Taiwan in several
ways. The US's resolve to oppose the invasion directly would be stronger
were US forces, systems or its homeland targeted, but it's possible that
[the US]{.mark} might **[intervene militarily]{.mark}** even [if China
directed its initial campaign **only against
Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically, the US has sought to
maintain ambiguity about this calculation. Broadly speaking, a direct US
military response would involve US maritime forces manoeuvring in the
Western Pacific and striking Chinese capabilities, employing some
version of DMO. Such a direct US response has been critiqued as being,
in turn, highly escalatory because it's likely to be operationally
necessary for US strikes on Chinese capabilities (for example, on
mainland-based command-and-control architecture, missile launch sites
and so on) required to establish and maintain American freedom of
manoeuvre.77

Since Donald Trump's reelection, his campaign promise to quickly end the
Russia-Ukraine War has seemed increasingly out of reach as [the
situation in [Ukraine continues to deteriorate]{.mark}.]{.underline}
It\'s hard to imagine that dispatching more arms to Ukraine and slapping
more sanctions on Russia will be successful at achieving peace. The
Russian army continues its slow but steady advance, so [Putin may well
have concluded that his country should push for a more complete Russian
military victory and defy any near-term Western peace
overtures.]{.underline} However, [[the incoming administration has an
opportunity to]{.mark} break from the status quo and [entice Russia to
end the war. This should include incentives with respect to the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} --- an issue [[guaranteed to
capture]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir [[Putin's
attention]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such an option could also prove
attractive to Trump, who approaches the world through the lens of a
businessman looking to strike big deals. Putin's participation in a
November ceremony launching the new nuclear icebreaker Chukotka elicited
little notice in the West but [demonstrated the Russian president's
laser-like focus on developing the Arctic region]{.underline}. The
vessel is reported to be the largest and most capable icebreaker in the
world at 567 feet in length and displacing 33,500 tons, with two nuclear
reactors that provide 350 megawatts of power, allowing it to break
through ice nearly 10 feet thick. Such ships do not come cheap, and the
Chukotka is priced at about half a billion dollars. The Chukotka is the
fourth in a series of nuclear icebreakers, with another of the same
class, the Yakutia, also nearing completion and a fresh keel due to be
laid down in 2025. In October, an even more ambitious class of nuclear
icebreakers received the green light for production in a shipyard near
Vladivostok, costing \$1 billion, an astronomical sum in today's Russia.
The destination of the icebreakers is the Northern Sea Route (NSR), a
shipping route that runs north of Russia and connects Western Europe to
the Asia-Pacific. This year, a variety of new records have been set in
the NSR, including for the largest ever container ship, which traversed
the NSR in September, and the most oil ever transported. [For the
Russian leader confronting both political and economic headwinds, the
Arctic is always near the top of the agenda]{.underline} because it
comprises about 10% of Russian GDP and 20% of its exports. Russian
energy analysts are aiming to multiply Russian resource exports over the
NSR by six or seven times to 200 million tons in the next five years.
According to a mid-2024 report, "[Russia certainly has the Arctic
resources to power this enormous expansion of exports."]{.underline}
Yet, [the Kremlin's Arctic ambitions go well beyond oil and
gas]{.underline}. As all Russian leaders understand, the country's
economic growth has always been stymied by the simple fact that most of
Russia's giant rivers, such as the Ob, the Yenisei, and the Lena, all
flow north into the Arctic. Thus, a functional NSR that has year-round
navigation logically holds the key to unlocking major development in the
country's vast, resource-rich interior and more broadly for Siberia ---
a goal almost as old as the Russian state itself. Putin is well aware
that building tanks and missiles alone will not in itself make Russia
strong and prosperous in the future, but this mega-project could open
this possibility. China has also embraced the NSR through its "Polar
Silk Road" and has sought to partner closely with the Kremlin in the
Arctic. A 2024 Chinese analysis argued that Beijing should ensure that
Chinese and Russian corporations investing in the Arctic transit
corridor are profitable. Yet despite incremental progress, [Chinese and
[Russian analysts are aware that the Arctic passage will never achieve
its true potential without Western backing]{.mark}. This is why
[focusing on the Arctic is likely to have the largest effect on stopping
the war in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The long-sought
shipping route across the High North remains one of the few relatively
concrete geo-economic prizes that the Kremlin prizes on par with Ukraine
itself. Crucially, a newly dynamic transport corridor should apportion
some percentage of the ample profits --- say, 5 percent for the next
five decades --- to rebuilding Ukraine's destroyed infrastructure. This
consistent stream of resources would be a form of reparations payments
to Kyiv that would likely amount to hundreds of billions of dollars.
Undoubtedly, China would strongly support this plan. But a number of
other interested countries that are currently estranged from Russia ---
whether Canada, Finland, Norway, and Sweden in the West, or South Korea
and Japan in the East --- stand to profit from the NSR as well, with the
potential to ease global tensions across Eurasia. Parts of the U.S.
could also economically benefit, including Alaska, most obviously, but
also northern ports like Seattle and even Boston. Western countries at
the table for the NSR, moreover, will likely mean sounder environmental
standards. For this deal to have meaningful results, the U.S. would need
to lift sanctions that have been applied against NSR projects. It would
also be helpful if they acted to facilitate major European shipping
companies like Hapag Lloyd and Maersk to green light the route. These
steps might be sufficient, but the U.S. and Europe could further sweeten
the pot with encouragement and even incentives for Western investment
along the NSR. During the first Trump administration, the president made
some bold gestures in foreign policy and commendably took some political
risks for peace. To be sure, [the difficult issues with respect to
separation of forces, the rights of citizens in eastern Ukraine, and the
yet to be determined security architecture for Eastern Europe will
remain paramount in any settlement.]{.underline} Yet [by appending peace
proposals with [a carrot guaranteed to catch Putin's attention,
negotiations having a substantial Arctic component could]{.mark} gain
Trump's favor and find success]{.underline}. Trump's embrace and
marketing of this large-scale business deal could not only [[help bring
peace back to Eastern Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}, but could also
revitalize the continent's prospects more generally.

### 2AC -- Russia Win Inevitable

[Russian forces in Ukraine are suffering casualties at more than 400,000
per year ---]{.underline} enough to pack the house at the world's four
largest stadiums. Losses like these have been fuel for simultaneous talk
of inevitable Russian defeat or victory in the public conversation. What
should we make of this talk? [Can Russian forces sustain similar
losses]{.underline} in its ongoing war [in Ukraine]{.underline} and
rebuild to fight another day? The likely answer is "[yes]{.underline},"
and it speaks to Russian President Vladimir [Putin's approach toward
negotiations to end the war. In refusing to agree to an unconditional
ceasefire and skipping the latest peace talks in Turkey, [Putin is
playing for time]{.mark} --- because time appears to be on his
side.]{.underline} While Russia could run out of quality recruits,
[force replenishment through 2024 was far more successful than many
predicted]{.underline}. In April of that year, NATO Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe Gen. Christopher Cavoli observed that "Russia is
reconstituting that force far faster than our initial estimates
suggested. [[The army is actually now larger]{.mark} --- by 15 percent
--- [than it was when it invaded]{.mark} Ukraine]{.underline}." Whether
Russia can maintain its ability to reconstitute and even grow its forces
as its war in Ukraine progresses remains uncertain. [More certain is
[its advantage over Ukraine in]{.mark} terms of total
[population]{.mark}]{.underline}, with nearly four times as many people
and roughly 18.9 million males aged 20--39 relative to Ukraine's fewer
than five million males of that age. [[Russia can lose three times as
many troops as Ukraine and still suffer less]{.mark} in relative
terms.]{.underline} By 2035, Russia will have roughly 1.22 to 3.58
million fewer military-aged males than in 2025, according to U.N.
Population Division forecasts. However, even their 95 percent lower
bound forecast for 2035 leaves a total population of Russian males
between the ages of 20 and 44 of 20.1 million --- a number that is
greater than half of Ukraine's total population as of 2023. [[In]{.mark}
terms of replenishment of [equipment]{.mark}, [Russia also largely holds
the upper hand]{.mark} over Ukraine. [Artillery shells have proven
particularly crucial]{.mark}]{.underline} in the attritional, positional
fighting that has characterized much of the fighting after the early
months following Russia's February 2022 invasion. In March 2024, one
European intelligence official estimated that 12,000 artillery shells
were being fired in Ukraine each day --- roughly 10,000 by Russian
forces and 2,000 by Ukrainian forces. [[This gap has led to a
"significant advantage on the battlefield," and one that may be
growing]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2024, [Russian industry was producing
roughly 250,000 new artillery shells each month]{.underline}, a pace
expected to continue through 2025. This is compared to an estimated
30,000 produced by the United States each month in 2024 and another
roughly 83,000 produced by E.U. member countries aiding Ukraine.
Assuming Russian production rates hold constant, only by 2026 will the
combined U.S. and E.U. monthly artillery shell production pass Russia,
if we also assume that U.S. and E.U. targets are met. Moreover, for this
to matter for Ukraine, the United States needs to continue to supply
Ukraine --- a questionable assumption given U.S. President Donald
Trump's stated desire to shift the burden of support for Ukraine to
America's European allies. Russia has been relying heavily on Soviet-era
stocks for medium and heavy equipment replenishment. Indeed, its stock
of Soviet-era tanks are far from tapped and could be further relied upon
if needed. But it is not as if the majority of Russian tanks on the
battlefield have been older models pulled from storage and refurbished
--- Russia's new production has been noteworthy. The U.K. Ministry of
Defence assessed as of January 2024 that Russia had the ability to
"produce 100 main battle tanks per month" and could likely maintain
offensive armor operations for the "foreseeable future." Testimony from
Cavoli on April 3, 2025, further increased that estimate, stating that
Russia is expected to produce "1,500 tanks and 3,000 armored vehicles"
in 2025. The Russian defense industry may not be able to further
increase its already ramped-up T-90 tank production, for example, but it
may not need to. Even if losses continue apace, some analysts assert
that Russia can maintain its recent rate of losses through 2026 or 2027.
This reality is apparently well appreciated by Ukrainians on the
battlefield. Indicative of this is one commander in Ukraine's 11th
National Guard Brigade's exasperated statement after fighting near
Kherson in January 2024: "No matter how many times we hit the same
places, \[the Russians\] are constantly replenished." In the long term,
there is a question of the sustainability of Russia's military
Keynesianism. If the Kremlin spends as planned for 2025, 40 percent of
Russia's federal expenditures would go to defense and national security
--- a share that would exceed Russia's combined spending on education,
health, and social and economic welfare. In contrast, to maintain its
global force posture, defense spending in the United States has averaged
15 percent of the total U.S. government budget over the past decade.
Such a high rate of defense and national security spending will have a
toll on non-military priorities in Russia. In the classic
guns-and-butter logic made famous in a 1953 speech from President Dwight
Eisenhower, money spent on military operations is also money not spent
on health, education, and other domestic priorities. These tradeoffs
arguably led to the collapse of the Soviet Union --- or at least this
was part of the logic that motivated U.S. strategic competition in the
Cold War with the Soviets. However, Russia's estimated military spending
levels as a percent of GDP are nowhere near estimated Soviet levels of
the mid-1980s, when societal strains were reaching their peak. Russia's
economy has and will continue to face strains. Amid these strains, we
can expect some analysts to continue to make dire predictions, arguing
that Russian economic collapse is imminent. It is also plausible that
[Russia's economy will continue to muddle through]{.underline}, with
faster economic growth than much of Western Europe over the next few
years. If so, the Russian military menace is unlikely to disappear any
time soon. As Chatham House's Mathieu Boulègue contends, "[[the Russian
military industry remains a formidable machine. It is likely to continue
to be able to muddle along, producing 'good enough' systems that will
still represent a significant threat to Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark},
NATO and their allies. This is especially true for stand-off and
asymmetric capabilities that have not yet been engaged in the war
against Ukraine."

1\. [[The risk of nuclear escalation]{.mark} over conventional attacks
[is exaggerated Ukraine's drone strikes were a blow to the widely held
belief that nonnuclear military attacks on nuclear-relevant facilities
or assets will lead automatically to uncontrollable nuclear
escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline} As I have argued previously, [too many
analysts of nuclear affairs appear to overweight the risk that if a
nuclear-armed country is facing attacks on nuclear-relevant
locations]{.underline} or assets by conventional weapon systems or
dual-capable ones (systems relevant to both nuclear and conventional
missions), [then that country will feel overwhelming pressure to
escalate to the use of nuclear weapons, perhaps even before assessing
the extent of the attacks. This logic looks convincing. But [it is
empirically unsupported]{.mark}. Russia may yet respond to the Ukrainian
attack. But [Russian nuclear retaliation in Ukraine seems unlikely, even
after Russia lowered its]{.mark} stated [threshold for nuclear
use]{.mark} in September 2024]{.underline}. Ukrainian drone strikes on
multiple [Russian bomber bases would seem to be exactly the sort of
attack that would trigger Russia's lower threshold for resorting to
nuclear weapons. Yet no such use has materialized.]{.underline} To be
clear, [[nuclear-armed states may well resort to nuclear use to coerce

costs, [such as the destruction of a large portion of that state's

### Prolif Defense

#### No prolif [cascade]{.underline} or [escalation]{.underline}.

political science, Ohio State University), 2021, "7. Proliferation,
Terrorism, Humanitarian Intervention, and Other Problems" in The
Stupidity of War: American Foreign Policy and the Case for Complacency,

Although we have now suffered through three-quarters of a century
characterized by alarmism about the disasters inherent in nuclear
proliferation, [the substantive [consequences of
**prolif**]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [[have been]{.mark} quite
**[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The weapons have certainly generated
obsession, and they have greatly affected military spending, diplomatic
posturing, and ingenious theorizing. However, [the **few countries** to
which the weapons have proliferated]{.underline} have for the most part
found them a notable waste of time, money, effort, and scientific
talent. They have [quietly kept them in **storage** and have not even
found much benefit in rattling them]{.underline} from time to time.
Insofar as the weapons have been "used," it has been to stoke the
national ego and to deter real or imagined threats.

It is sometimes said, or implied, that proliferation has had little
consequence because the only countries to possess nuclear weapons have
had rational leaders. But [**[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}** have
[**proliferated** to]{.mark} large, important countries run by
unchallenged **[monsters]{.mark}**]{.underline} who, at the time they
acquired the bombs, were certifiably deranged: Josef
[Stalin]{.underline}, who in 1949 was planning to change the climate of
the Soviet Union by planting a lot of trees, [and Mao]{.underline}
Zedong, who in 1964 had just carried out a bizarre social experiment
that resulted in an artificial famine in which tens of millions of
Chinese perished.6 [[Yet **neither**]{.underline}]{.mark} country
[[used]{.mark} its nuclear weapons [for anything other than
**deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline} and ego-boosting.7

[There has never been a militarily **compelling**]{.underline} -- or
even minimally sensible -- [reason to use nuclear weapons, particularly
due to an **inability** to identify **suitable targets**]{.underline} or
ones [that could not be attacked about **as effectively** by
**conventional** munitions]{.underline}. And [it is **difficult to see**
how nuclear weapons **benefited** their possessors]{.underline} in
specific military ventures. Israel's presumed nuclear weapons did not
restrain the Arabs from attacking in 1973, nor did Britain's prevent
Argentina's seizure of the Falklands in 1982. Similarly, the tens of
thousands of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the enveloping allied
forces did not cause Saddam Hussein to order his occupying forces out of
Kuwait in 1990. Nor did possession of the bomb benefit America in Korea,
Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan; France in Algeria; or the Soviet Union in
Afghanistan.8

Proliferation alarmists may occasionally grant that countries
principally obtain a nuclear arsenal to counter real or perceived
threats, but many go on to argue that the newly nuclear country will
then use its nuclear weapons to "dominate" the area. That argument was
repeatedly used with dramatic urgency before 2003 for the dangers
supposedly posed by Saddam Hussein as discussed in Chapter 4, and it is
now being applied to Iran.

Exactly how that domination business is to be carried out is never made
clear. 9 But the notion, apparently, is that should an atomic Iraq (in
earlier fantasies) or North Korea or Iran (in present ones) rattle the
occasional rocket, other countries in the area, suitably intimidated,
would supinely bow to its demands. It seems far more likely that [[if
a]{.mark} nuclear [country **brandishes**]{.mark} its weapons [to
**intimidate**]{.mark} **others** or to get its way]{.underline}, it
will find that [[those threatened]{.mark}, rather than
**capitulating**]{.underline} to its blandishments [or rushing off to
build a **compensating arsenal**]{.underline} of their own,
[[will]{.mark} **ally** with others to **[stand up]{.mark}** to the
intimidation]{.underline} -- rather in the way they coalesced into an
alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

[It is also argued that nuclear weapons **embolden** a country to do
mischief]{.underline} with less fear of punishing consequences. However,
countries like Iran already seem about as free as they need to be to do
mischief (from the US standpoint) in the Middle East and [[rogue
states]{.underline}]{.mark} like the USSR, China, and North Korea [[do
not]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to have **[[step]{.underline}]{.mark}**ped
[[up]{.mark} their [mischief after]{.mark} gaining **[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There are conceivable situations under which nuclear weapons could serve
a deterrent function: perhaps if Iran had had them in 1980 or Kuwait had
had them in 1990, Iraq would not have invaded. However, under the
conditions in which we have actually lived, it is questionable whether
they have yet ever done so. In particular, as discussed in Chapter 1, it
is far from clear that a deterrence policy centered around nuclear
weapons is what kept the Cold War from becoming a hot one. To expect
countries that experienced World War III somehow to allow themselves to
tumble into anything resembling a repetition -- whether embellished with
nuclear weapons or not -- seems almost bizarre.

Moreover, [the [weapons have **not proved**]{.mark} to be [crucial
**status**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [or virility]{.underline} --
**[[symbols]{.underline}]{.mark}**. French President Charles de Gaulle
did opine in 1965 that "no country without an atom bomb could properly
consider itself independent," and Robert Gilpin concluded that "the
possession of nuclear weapons largely determines a nation's rank in the
hierarchy of international prestige." 10 In that tradition, some
analysts who describe themselves as "realists" have insisted for years
that Germany and Japan must soon come to their senses and quest after
nuclear weapons.11

But, as Robert Jervis has observed, "[India, China, and Israel may have
**decreased** the chance of **direct attack**]{.underline} by developing
nuclear weapons, [but it is **hard to argue** that they have increased
their general **prestige**]{.underline} or influence." 12 And, as
Jenifer Mackby and Walter Slocombe note:

Undoubtedly some countries have pursued nuclear weapons more for status
than for security. However, [**Germany**, like]{.underline} its
erstwhile Axis ally, **[Japan]{.underline}**, has [become powerful
because of]{.underline} its [**economic** might rather than its
**military**]{.underline} might, [and its **renunciation** of nuclear
weapons may even have **reinforced its prestige**]{.underline}. It has
even managed to achieve its principal international objective --
reunification -- without becoming a nuclear state.13

Pakistan and Russia may garner more attention today than they would
without nukes, but would Japan's prestige be increased if it became
nuclear? Would anybody have more or less interest in Britain or France
if their arsenals held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay much
less if they had none? Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the
world with its economic growth? Or with its Olympics?

In addition, the [**[prolif]{.mark}**eration of nuclear weapons [has
been **far slower** than]{.mark}]{.underline} has been [commonly
**[predicted]{.mark}** primarily because the weapons do not generally
convey much advantage]{.underline} to their possessor. [**Dozens** of
technologically **capable** countries have **considered** obtaining
nuclear arsenals, but **very few have**]{.underline} done so. Indeed, as
Jacques Hymans has pointed out, [even **supposedly optimistic**
forecasts about nuclear dispersion have **proved** to be **too
pessimistic**.]{.underline}14 In fact, over the decades, [[a **huge
number** of countries]{.mark} **capable** of developing nuclear weapons
have **[neglected]{.mark}** even to **consider**]{.underline} the
opportunity -- for example, Canada, Italy, and Norway -- even as
Argentina, Brazil, Libya, South Korea, and Taiwan [have backed away from
[or **reversed**]{.mark} nuclear weapons [programs]{.mark}]{.underline},
and Belarus, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine have actually
[surrendered or **dismantled** an existing **nuclear
arsenal**]{.underline}.15 Some of that reduction is no doubt due to the
hostility (and in some cases the bribery) of the nuclear nations, but
experience certainly suggests, as Stephen Meyer has shown, [[there is no
"**technological imperative**]{.mark}" for countries [to obtain
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}** once they have achieved the
technical capacity]{.underline} to do so.16

In consequence, [[**alarmist predictions** about
**prolif**]{.mark}eration chains, **[cascades]{.mark}**, dominoes,
waves, avalanches, epidemics, [and]{.mark} **points of [no
return]{.mark}** have [proved]{.mark} to be
**[faulty]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Insofar as most [[leaders]{.mark} of
**most countries**]{.underline} (even rogue ones) have considered
acquiring the weapons, they [have come to [appreciate]{.mark} **several
[defects:]{.mark}** nuclear weapons are **[dangerous]{.mark}**,
distasteful, **[costly]{.mark}**, and likely to **[rile]{.mark} the
[neighbors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, as Hymans has demonstrated,
[the weapons have [also]{.mark} been **exceedingly [difficult]{.mark}**
[to obtain]{.mark} for administratively **dysfunctional** countries like
Iran]{.underline}.17

Moreover, the **[consequences of what little

### Democracy Defense

#### No impact to democracy

**Mousseau 16** -- Michael, Political Science Professor at the
University of Central Florida. "Grasping the scientific evidence: The
contractualist peace supersedes the democratic peace", Conflict
Management and Peace Science, pg. 1-18,
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0738894215616408>,

Resolution of this controversy is fundamental to the study and practice
of international relations. **[The observation of]{.underline}**
**[democratic peace is]{.underline}** **[''the closest thing we have to
an empirical law'']{.underline}** in the study of global politics (Levy,
1988: 662), **[and carries the profound implication that the spread of
democracy will end war]{.underline}**. **[New economic norms
theory]{.underline}**, on the other hand, **[yields the contrary
implication that universal [democracy will not end
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, **[[it is]{.mark} market-oriented
[development that creates]{.mark} a culture of
[contracting,]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and this]{.underline}**]{.mark}
culture **[[legitimates democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}** within nations
and causes peace among them. **[The policy implications could hardly be
more divergent:]{.underline}** **[to end war]{.underline}** (and support
democracy), **[the contractualist democracies should promote the
economies of nations at risk]{.underline}** (Krieger and Meierrieks,
2015; Meierrieks, 2012; Mousseau, 2000, 2009, 2012a, 2013; Nieman,
2015).

In the literature are five factual claims for why we should continue to
believe that democracy causes peace: (1) an assertion that in three of
the five studies that overturned the democratic peace (Mousseau, 2013;
Mousseau et al., 2013a, b), the insignificance of democracy controlling
for contractualist economy is due to the treatment of missing data for
contractualist economy (Dafoe et al., 2013, henceforth DOR); (2) a claim
of error in the measure for conflict (DOR) that appears in one of the
five studies that overturned the democratic peace (Mousseau, 2013); (3)
an alleged misinterpretation of an interaction term that appears in one
of the five studies (Mousseau, 2009) that overturned the democratic
peace, along with in inference of democratic causality from an
interaction of democracy with contractualist economy (Dafoe and Russett,
2013; DOR); (4) a claim of reverse causality, of democracy causing
contractualist economy (Ray, 2013); and (5) a report of multiple
regressions with most said to show democratic significance after
controlling for contractualist economy (DOR).

This study investigates all five of these factual claims. I begin by
addressing the issue of missing data by constructing two entirely new
measures for contractualist economy. I then take up possible measurement
error in the dependent variable by reporting tests using both my own
(Mousseau, 2013) and DOR's measures for conflict. Next, I disaggregate
the data to investigate a causal interaction of democracy with
contractualist economy. I then examine the evidence for reverse
causality, and scrutinize the competing test models to pinpoint the
exact factors that can account for differences in test outcomes.

The results are consistent across all tests: there is no credible
evidence supporting democracy as a cause of peace. **[Using DOR's base
model, [the impact of democracy is zero regardless of how]{.mark}
contractualist economy or [interstate conflict is
measured]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[There is no misinterpreted
interaction term]{.underline}** in any study that has overturned the
democratic peace, and the disaggregation of the data yields no support
for a causal interaction of democracy with contractualist economy.
**[Ray's]{.underline}** (2013) **[evidence]{.underline}** for reverse
causality from democracy to contractualist economy **[is shown to be
based on an erroneous research design]{.underline}**. And of DOR's 120
separate regressions that consider contractualist economy, 116 contain
controversial measurement and specification practices; the remaining
four are analyses of all (fatal and non-fatal) disputes, where the
correlation of democracy with peace is limited to mixedeconomic dyads,
those where one state has a contractualist economy and the other does
not, a subset that includes only 27% of dyads from 1951 to 2001,
including only 50% of democratic dyads. It is further shown that **[this
[marginal peace is a statistical artifact]{.mark} since [it does not
exist among neighbors]{.mark} where everyone has an equal opportunity to
fight.]{.underline}**

#### Democracy is resilient.

Jason **Willick 23**, Washington Post Columnist, Editorial Writer for
the Wall Street Journal and American Interest, "What if the crisis of
democracy is (mostly) in our heads?", The Washington Post, 1/30/23,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/30/democratic-more-resilient-than-expected/

In "Subjective and [**[Objective Measures]{.mark}** of Democratic
Backsliding]{.underline}," the political scientists Andrew Little of the
University of California at Berkeley and Anne Meng of the University of
Virginia [[find]{.mark} that]{.underline} the post-Cold War expansion of
democracy in nations around the world has, on average, held. "Recent
studies that find [[evi]{.mark}dence [of]{.mark} global
[backsliding]{.mark}]{.underline}," they observe, "[rely]{.underline}
heavily if not [**[entirely]{.mark}** on **[subjective]{.mark}
indicators**"]{.underline} --- such as asking experts to rate, [based on
their **own judgment**]{.underline}, the extent to which an election was
"free and fair."

[Little and Meng]{.underline} instead [measure democracy based on
**[quantifiable factors]{.mark}**]{.underline} less susceptible to
individual bias. They [[find]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example,
[**[no]{.mark} overall [decline]{.mark}** in **electoral
competition**]{.underline}. Across the world, ["The [**rate** of]{.mark}
leader]{.underline} and ruling party [[turnover]{.mark} has
remained]{.underline} fairly **[[constant]{.underline}]{.mark}** since
the late 1990s," the paper says. "[If anything, the [vote shares]{.mark}
of incumbent leaders]{.underline} in executive elections and incumbent
parties in legislatures [have **[decreased]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
recent years."

They also measured the prevalence of constraints on national leaders,
such as term limits. From 2000 to 2018, according to the paper, 60
leaders sought to evade term limits, and 34 succeeded, but the rate was
"fairly constant" over time. In an attempt to objectively measure press
freedom, the authors analyze data from the Committee to Protect
Journalists. It's a mixed picture: Murders of journalists have been
declining since 2008, but the number of journalists imprisoned has been
rising since 2000.

[The authors created their own democracy [index]{.mark}]{.underline}
reaching back to 1980, [[relying on **hard inputs**]{.underline}]{.mark}
such as the share of a population eligible to vote, [rather than
**subjective interpretation**]{.underline} by experts. "The index in
2020 [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly [as [**high** as]{.mark} it has
**[ever]{.mark} been**]{.underline}," they conclude.

Some countries, such as Hungary and Venezuela, have grown more
authoritarian, but those declines have been balanced by more-democratic
processes in other countries. When democracy scores are weighted by a
country's population, the index does show a recent downturn, but that
essentially disappears when India and China (which has hardened its
authoritarianism under Xi Jinping) are excluded.

[[Reports]{.mark} of]{.underline} a global [democratic
retreat]{.underline} might partly be [[driven by]{.mark} a [**feedback
loop** between **media** and **experts**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} Donald [Trump's]{.underline} candidacy and
[presidency prompted **greater attention** to democratic
health]{.underline} in the press, a focus that prompted experts to rate
political systems more stringently in surveys. Those surveys, in turn,
generated more media coverage.

[Another study]{.underline} out this month [helps explain the divergence
between]{.underline} democratic [perceptions and realities]{.underline}.
The author, James D. Bryan, a doctoral candidate at American University,
analyzed the World Values Survey and the European Values Survey between
2010 and 2022 to track how citizens' understanding of democracy evolved
under different political circumstances. His "[findings suggest [one's
conception]{.mark}]{.underline} of democracy [can be a **[fluid
attitude]{.mark}** that [citizens mold to match]{.mark} their
**[partisan self-interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

Conclusion

**[The [dyadic understanding of]{.mark} the [dem]{.mark}ocratic [peace
has become ubiquitous]{.mark}]{.underline}** in International Relations.
**[[By looking beyond simple dyadic analysis, accounting for]{.mark} the
embededness of [states in a]{.mark} much more [complex network]{.mark},
we found the democratic peace may not be]{.underline}** as
**[robust]{.underline}** as previously thought. Our results demonstrate
that **[after accounting for the tendency for like-regime states with
common enemies not to fight one another, the effect of [the democratic
peace]{.mark} [not only vanishes, but]{.mark}]{.underline}** jointly
**[[democratic dyads seem]{.underline}]{.mark}** to be **[[*more*
conflict prone]{.underline}]{.mark}** than mixed dyads. **[[These
results are consistent across]{.mark} operationalizations of the outcome
variable, our triadic closure predictor, measurements of joint
democracy, and [a variety of other factors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We
believe this explanation for the democratic peace is not a mechanism for
understanding the democratic peace, but instead, an alternative. What we
have shown here is that **[conflict between democracies indeed exists
and the peaceful relations occasionally found are not necessarily a
function of the affinity of democratic states, or intrinsic attributes
of democratic states, but instead, a function of the strategic
inefficiencies of fighting a state with a shared enemy]{.underline}**.
While regime type may influence the interests of states, we find that it
does not directly influence the probability that any two states fight
one another.

There are three major implications to our research. First, **[[scholars
should be hesitant to consider dyadic conflict in isolation]{.mark}, as
[there are network dependencies]{.mark} informing whether a state
engages or joins a MID]{.underline}**. Second, **[preferences operating
in addition to network interdependencies and collaboration explain much
of the democratic peace]{.underline}**. Third, when studying conflict,
scholars and practitioners should consider the cost structure of
collaboration, and how these dynamics inform not only conflict
initiation, but conflict escalation. Particularly interesting is that
the theoretical mechanism at work here is dramatically simpler than any
of the established justifications for the democratic peace. We do not
rely on arguments about institutions or norms, but just the simple and
intuitive proposition that it does not make much sense for two states
fighting a third to also fight each other. **[What the existing
literature seems to have missed]{.underline}**, usually theoretically
and almost always empirically, **[is that [dyadic conflicts do not occur
in isolation, but in]{.mark} the context of [a complex network of
relations.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

###  NATO Internal Link/Impact Defense

#### No [Russian]{.underline} nuclear use. 

**[Shinkman 23']{.underline}** -- Paul, Senior Writer of National
Security at U.S. News. "Putin's Hollow Nuclear Threat", U.S. News,
https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2023-02-24/why-ukraine-wont-lead-putin-to-nuclear-war,
02-24-2023

"[The [likelihood of Russia]{.mark} choosing]{.underline} -- or Putin
choosing -- [[to use **nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** directly
against the West [is **astronomically low**]{.mark}. **It [should not
even be seriously considered]{.mark} at this stage**," says Katherine
Lawlor, senior intelligence analyst at the independent Institute for the
Study of War]{.underline}, which has fastidiously tracked Russia's
military movements since it first invaded Ukraine. "[[Putin would
love]{.mark} it [if]{.mark} Western [leaders **believed**]{.mark} that
[he might]{.mark}. He is many things, [but **he is not
suicidal**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She adds that Putin
ultimately does not want war with NATO -- particularly given the current
state of the Russian army. "[He couldn't even win a conventional war in
Ukraine]{.underline}." [[Putin's **references** to potential nuclear
war]{.mark} serve as an extension of capitalizing on Russia's limited
economic and military resources to bend others' will. It's [a
**tactic**]{.mark} the Russian leader has **accelerated**]{.underline}
since first invading Ukraine in 2014, shortly before Obama dismissed the
former core of the Soviet Union as nothing more than a "regional power."
The method has worked to some degree, most visibly by isolating Germany
from its traditional ironclad allies in the West due to Berlin's
protracted reluctance to send new forms of military aid to Ukraine's
military. And it has effectively raised concern among experts who
specialize in the potential for nuclear war. "It would be dangerous to
assume that Putin would never use nuclear weapons," says Jon Wolfsthal,
a senior adviser to nuclear disarmament advocacy group Global Zero and a
member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which annually
publishes its "Doomsday Clock" marking the potential threat of nuclear
war. He notes that approach "has not been adopted by the United States
Government, by NATO nor by the Bulletin." "Blind faith in deterrence
does not guarantee stability, nor does it take heed of the lessons of
history -- recent and more distant -- that deterrence is fragile and can
fail," he says. "As financial and military pressures on Putin grow, the
concern is that he will not think clearly or may put more emphasis on
survival and the destruction of Ukraine than he does on alliances or
friends." The Bulletin advanced the Doomsday Clock to 90 seconds to
midnight in late January -- closer to "midnight," or theoretical
annihilation, than ever before -- citing not only the threat of nuclear
war from Russia with regard to Ukraine but also the spread of disease
and climate volatility that its invasion has exacerbated. Wolfsthal adds
that the primary tools Western leaders have used to deter Russia --
chiefly economic isolation -- have not yet materialized to a level Putin
takes seriously. "He has invaded a sovereign country, committed war
crimes and is engaged in random bombing of civilians, and yet trade with
a number of countries in Europe and elsewhere has increased," he says.
"If there is a major effort to use economic threats to deter Putin's
possible use of nuclear weapons, we have not seen it, and it has not
been visibly communicated to Russia as far as our research indicates."
Others believe that [Putin's most ferocious [nuclear
rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline} mostly [[exposes the extent to which
the]{.mark} embattled Russian [leader feels **desperate** for]{.mark}
**new sources of [leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They suggest that
leverage is what he was seeking this week with a sudden announcement
that he would suspend Russia's involvement in the New START treaty, the
last nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia. "What
[this is]{.underline}, is [a message]{.underline}," says John Erath, a
former top National Security Council official for European affairs, now
senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation. "For the last six months and more, [Russia\'s
strategy has been to seek leverage on the West to end its support to
Ukraine]{.underline} and suspend the hostilities on terms favorable to
Russia." "This is another ingredient in that stew," he adds. "And like
much Russian food, it is lacking in nutritional value." Erath suggests
that Putin thinks he can trade on the promise of resuming Russia's
obligations to the treaty to convince the U.S. to cease its support for
Ukraine's goals in the war and to acknowledge the Russian army's gains.
"In that sense, [the announcement is a big deal
symbolically]{.underline}," Erath says, adding that Secretary of State
Antony Blinken was right to call the statement "unfortunate and
irresponsible." [Since Putin's decision to invade Ukraine,
[Russia's]{.mark} other [sources of influence are]{.mark} **rapidly
[dwindling]{.mark}**]{.underline} or, more surprisingly, are now exposed
as ineffectual. European countries that previously relied heavily on
flows of Russian energy -- particularly natural gas -- have defied
expectations and survived winter so far without supplies from Moscow.
The endemic rot of corruption within its Ministry of Defense has become
widely exposed. Its conventional military has suffered a string of
embarrassing defeats on the battlefield, including during the beginning
of an ongoing offensive that Russia believed would shift momentum in its
favor. The Institute for the Study of War, like several other private
intelligence firms, believes Putin's nuclear saber-rattling serves more
as an information operation designed to prevent the U.S. and Ukraine's
partners in Europe from providing additional military aid that could be
considered escalatory, such as long-range rockets or sophisticated
tanks. He has had some success, chiefly in Germany's initial hesitancy
to provide Leopard tanks. A year into the war, some things appear to
remain off the table: The U.S. is firmly and vocally opposed to a no-fly
zone, which Ukraine has sought since Day One of the invasion to limit
Russia's ability to attack its defenses and its civilian centers from
the skies. And while American officials publicly say the course of the
war is up to the Ukrainians, they have reportedly bristled at the
suggestion that Kyiv would seek to reclaim the Crimean Peninsula, seized
by Russia in 2014. Similarly, the U.S. has balked at the possibility of
providing weapons that could carry the war into Russia itself. What
Putin also has in his favor is a dramatic reversal in the outlook of
some key figures in the Republican Party, who have inexplicably changed
their perspective on Russia under the leadership of Trump in recent
years. With Moscow once the center of Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" and
more recently viewed as an autocratic state seeking to reestablish an
empire by force at the cost of newly democratic nations, the party of
Trump finds itself with an estimated 97% percent of the Russian army
engaged in a ground war and being routed by a foreign army without the
loss of a single American life -- yet questioning the financial cost of
the commitment. What that means in the course of a presidential campaign
that prominently features Trump and a host of similar-minded Republicans
competing for the base he secured remains to be seen. The 70-year-old
Putin, in office since 1999 and frequently referred to as "president for
life," may conclude he has only to wait out Biden's promises of
steadfast support for Ukraine. But for Putin to follow through on
launching a nuclear attack, he would have to believe that doing so would
achieve a military objective that outweighs the surefire response of a
conventional military response from NATO, as well as the ensured
international isolation from what few partners Russia has left --
chiefly in China and India, where leaders have warned Putin against
nuclear weapons use. [With[**in** Russia]{.mark}, the **[war is not
popular]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though polling suggests Putin has not
yet lost the faith of the majority of ordinary Russians. Still,
[[reports emerge]{.mark} regularly [about]{.mark} the **[lack of
confidence]{.mark}** Russian [troops have in]{.mark} their
[leaders]{.mark} up the chain of command]{.underline} -- leading some
analysts to even speculate whether generals charged with executing
nuclear launch orders would comply with their directives. [Using
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** also **[wouldn't achieve
Putin's]{.mark} battlefield [aims]{.mark}**. Russian military [doctrine
calls for]{.mark} the use of low-yield nuclear [warheads as a]{.mark}
**last-ditch [tactic]{.mark}**]{.underline} to punch a hole in enemy
lines that mechanized infantry could then exploit. "[The problem is
[Russian forces are **utterly degraded**]{.mark}, absolutely
shattered]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She notes the same is true of the
Ukrainian military but adds that Russia does not currently have a single
deployable division of troops that could carry out that level of
operations. "[Then [factor in NATO retaliation]{.mark} for violating the
nuclear taboo]{.underline}, likely to include conventional missile
strikes on Russian headquarters, ammunition depots and storage
facilities within Ukraine," she says. "[[You've]{.mark} just [**lost**
the operational advantage]{.mark} you might have gained by using
low-yield nuclear weapons]{.underline} -- even if you use 10 or 15."
This scenario, however, exists within Russian offensive operations.
Lawlor adds these circumstances could change if Russia feels it is
squarely in a defensive position and needs to prevent "all-out
disaster." "You have to think about the human response to nuclear use,"
she says, describing the effect on a Ukrainian soldier who witnesses a
rising mushroom cloud several miles away toward the front lines. "The
symbolism is really important in that the Russians may assume it would
have a devastating effect on the morale of the surviving Ukrainian
forces," Lawlor says. "At this stage in the war, though, it's not even
under consideration because the Russians are still conducting offensive
operations." At least some of those who have engaged with Putin directly
agree. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed earlier this month
that he had received direct warnings from Putin of nuclear war. "He
threatened me at one point, and he said, \'Boris, I don\'t want to hurt
you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute,\' or something
like that. Jolly," the conservative politician told the BBC. Johnson
later explained to Fox News that he believed that what Putin was "trying
to do was creep me out ... trying to reduce it to a story about a
nuclear standoff between Russia and NATO." He [[argued]{.mark} that
[**Putin understands** the **devastating effect** on **Russia** if it
were to launch nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Both sides want to [avoid escalation]{.underline}.

Political Science and former Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost of
University of California, Riverside, received a Fulbright Grant, a
Fellowship from the Smith-Richardson Foundation to study Ukraine.

U.S.-Russia war", UC Riverside News,

05-08-2023

[Q: Is the U.S. effectively at war with Russia?]{.underline}
D\'Anieri**[: No. There is a big gap]{.underline}**, [well-understood on
all sides, between arming an ally and directly engaging with
Russia.]{.underline} There were many parallel examples during the Cold
War when the U.S. and Soviet Union (Russia) aided each other's enemies
without directly getting involved, and while this didn't always make the
other side happy, it was never seen as direct attack[. In fact, the
[U.S. and Russia]{.mark}n militaries have **for decades**]{.underline}
[[been]{.underline}]{.mark} **[very [careful]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to
avoid]{.mark} [direct]{.mark}ly [shooting]{.mark} at one
another,]{.underline} **[for fear of where it might end.]{.underline}**
Q: [Are we close to full-scale world war?]{.underline} D\'Anieri: [No.
The U.S. has **not attacked**]{.underline} [Russia and Russia has **not
attacked** the U.S., and neither of those things is **even remotely
likely at this point.**]{.underline} Q: [What is the price of
[Russian]{.mark} military [strikes]{.mark} on U.S. soil?]{.underline} Is
there a more likely course of Russian retaliation against the U.S.?
D\'Anieri: [Such an attack must be regarded as **[extremely
unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [If such an attack were to
take place, the [U.S. would]{.mark}]{.underline} **[likely seek to
[respond]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in a way that is
**proportional**]{.underline} [but **not escalatory.**]{.underline}
[[**Uncertainty** about]{.mark} what would lead to]{.underline}
[**[escalation]{.underline}** [explains]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[why]{.mark} the [U.S. and Russia take]{.mark}]{.underline} **[such
[care]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to avoid]{.mark} direct
[combat]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even as they **support competing
sides**]{.underline} in some conflicts. Russia has sought to intervene
in U.S. elections in the past, and likely will continue to do so. One
might also expect cyber attacks, but we have not seen them thus far in
this war. That suggests the [[Russians understand]{.mark} that
[they]{.mark} **too [are vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is also
quite likely that [with Russian forces already **overextended** fighting
against **Ukraine**, [Russian leaders realize]{.mark} that a [**second
major conflict** is not in their interest]{.mark}.]{.underline} Q:
Checking in at 14 months, how heavy is the cost of war for Russia, in
terms of the human toll and economics? Has Russia made resource and
allocation adjustments in the past months that will allow it to sustain
these losses? D\'Anieri: Russia's recent war efforts appear to be
unsustainable. They have lost large numbers of soldiers and expended
significant amounts of ammunition, such that commanders in the field are
complaining about shortages and are suggesting that they may soon have
to switch from offense to defense, which is less costly in terms of
people and materiel. Overall, the Russian economy is holding up. Growth
is very slow, and shortages of various imported goods are mounting, but
there are no signs that economic factors will severely constrain the war
effort any time soon. However, it would appear that [before the Russian
military could undertake **another large-scale offensive**]{.underline},
[a significant **program of recruitment**,]{.underline}
**[training]{.underline}**, [and **re-arming**]{.underline} [would need
to take place]{.underline}. [It appears that [Russia **cannot
retake**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the offensive]{.mark} in
2023.]{.underline}

months** out of the year.]{.underline}

[[Transporting]{.mark} hundreds of thousands of [soldiers]{.mark} across
the Taiwan Strait [would take **weeks** and]{.mark} require
[**thousands** of ships]{.mark}. Each crossing would take **hours**,
allowing Taiwan to **target** the ships]{.underline}, mass troops on
potential landing sites, [and erect **barriers**.]{.underline}

[China would need to **shift** military assets]{.underline} to its
eastern coast and undertake other visible preparations for an invasion,
[which Taiwan and the United States would likely be able to
**detect**.]{.underline}

Some [questions remains about whether China has the **naval vessels** it
would **need**]{.underline} to invade Taiwan successfully.
[[China's]{.mark} amphibious [fleet is **relatively
small**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and although Beijing will likely turn to
civilian ships to sustain and supplement an invading force, those take
longer to unload and would be more vulnerable to Taiwanese missiles.

Few Places to Land

Even if Chinese troops successfully cross the strait, [**few**
deep-water **ports and beaches** in Taiwan could **accommodate** a large
**landing force.**]{.underline}

Beijing would also have to assume [[Taiwan could **destroy**]{.mark} its
major **[ports]{.mark}** at a conflict's outset [to **prevent** an
**invader**]{.mark}]{.underline} from using them.

[Taiwan's west coast]{.underline} has shallow waters extending from most
of its beaches, meaning they [are **not ideal** for an invading
force.]{.underline}

[Taiwan's east coast]{.underline} is lined by cliffs that [are too steep
for an invading force to scale.]{.underline} Moving to Taiwan's major
population centers is only possible via a few narrow passes and tunnels,
which Taiwan can destroy or defend.

The D-Day operation in World War II was the largest amphibious invasion
in military history, involving seven thousand ships and almost two
hundred thousand troops who crossed the nearly one-hundred-mile English
Channel. Over a period of three-plus weeks, 850,000 troops landed on the
beaches of Normandy to liberate France. [A Chinese **amphibious
invasion** of Taiwan would likely have to **dwarf** D-Day in
scale.]{.underline}

Due to the shallow water, [[China would have to]{.mark} anchor ships
**far from Taiwan's coast** and [move equipment]{.mark}]{.underline} to
the shores [**slo[wly]{.mark}**[, making the ships
**vulnerable**]{.mark} to Taiwanese missiles and artillery.]{.underline}

[[Taiwan]{.mark} has also [invested in **defenses**, from **mines**
to]{.mark} anti-landing **spikes**, and mobile [missile
**launchers**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Despite China's rapid military **modernization**]{.underline} and its
focus on preparing for military scenarios in the Taiwan Strait, [[Taiwan
has inherent]{.mark} defensive **[advantages]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
China will find difficult to overcome.

Mountainous and Unforgiving Terrain

Even if China's military successfully established a beachhead on Taiwan,
it would struggle to navigate the mountainous terrain to secure the
island.

Taiwan's military, by contrast, has the advantage of knowing the land
and terrain and how to defend it.

Taiwan has mountain peaks reaching over twelve thousand feet. Taiwanese
troops could hide in those mountains and wage a guerrilla warfare
campaign.

[Traversing]{.underline} those [mountains to move **inland** would be
**challenging**, rendering Taiwan's east coast **far less
useful**]{.underline} and forcing invaders to focus on attacking the
island's west coast. In addition, although Taiwan has major ports
located in the south, moving to the north is also hard because there are
few major roadways and many river crossings. As a result, [a Chinese
[invasion would]{.mark} likely [have to **focus** squarely on]{.mark}
the ports and beaches located near **[Taipei]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Strategic Chokepoints

[With few viable beaches and ports to choose from and the difficulty of
moving forces]{.underline} across the island, [China's concentration
would turn to **Taiwan's capital** region]{.underline}, home to over
one-fourth of its population. [China's military would seek to **seize
control** of Taipei]{.underline} and depose Taiwan's government.

Driven by the political objective of establishing full control over
Taiwan, [China would **need to seize control** of Taiwan's capital of
**Taipei**.]{.underline}

[[However, gaining **control** of Taipei]{.mark} to establish **full
control** over Taiwan [would be **enormously
difficult**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Few routes lead into the city, which
sits in a bowl, ringed by mountains that defenders can utilize to target
an invading force.

To prevent China's military from seizing the capital, [[Taiwan
can]{.mark} choose to [**destroy** the]{.mark} city's major [**port**
and]{.mark} the tunnels and [highways]{.mark}]{.underline} leading into
the city.

Even if China's military entered Taipei, it would have to consider
conducting urban warfare.

Costly Urban Warfare

Given the island's terrain, most of Taiwan's twenty-three million people
live in a handful of cities, with seven million residing in Taipei.

To conquer Taiwan, [[China would]{.mark} therefore [be forced into
**urban combat**]{.mark}, fighting street by street.]{.underline}

[[That]{.mark} approach [would mean a]{.mark} slow, **[costly
invasion]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Taiwan has **inherent advantages** that will make an invasion
difficult, expensive, and uncertain.]{.underline} Still, the Taiwanese
people's will to fight and resist will likely prove more decisive than
mountains, ports, roads, or the ocean. If China conducts the operation
with little opposition, it can probably navigate and overcome those
obstacles. However, [[if confronted with **millions**]{.mark} **of
people** [determined to repel]{.mark} an [invasion, China will face
a]{.mark} much **[tougher task]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### No [Taiwan]{.underline} war.

All that said, [the actual [risk of]{.mark} imminent [Chinese military
action against Taiwan]{.mark} remains [**low**. Beijing **always
flexes**]{.mark} military muscle]{.underline} when highest-level U.S.
and Taiwanese officials meet face to face. Yet, though Speaker
McCarthy's visit with Taiwan's president marks the highest-level
U.S.-Taiwan meeting on US soil since 1979, China's latest response was
less militarily threatening than its reaction to last summer's visit to
Taiwan by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- and Beijing is well aware that
Washington will notice that.

More importantly, [[Xi is spending]{.mark} considerable
[energy]{.mark}]{.underline} these days [on playing a larger role on the
global stage]{.underline}, particularly [[as a **peacemaker**]{.mark}.
He]{.underline} has [offered a 12-point peace plan for
Ukraine]{.underline} he hopes will encourage others to see China as a
global mediator, even if this particular plan has no chance of success.
This past weekend, [Xi [welcomed]{.mark}]{.underline} French President
Emmanuel [[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark} and European Commission Chairman
Ursula Von der Leyen to Beijing for discussion of the Ukraine war and
the future of China's relations with Europe more broadly. Though Xi
didn't promise his European guests to lean harder on Russia, [the
Chinese and French governments issued a joint statement pledging they
would work together to bring Russian and Ukrainian negotiators to
the]{.underline} bargaining [table]{.underline}.

[This [follows]{.mark} the]{.underline} remarkable [[visit]{.mark} to
China of the foreign ministers [of]{.mark}]{.underline} Middle East
rivals [[Iran and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, where they agreed
under China's mediation to improve their historically contentious
relationship. Most importantly, just days ago[, Taiwan's former
president [Ma]{.mark} Ying-jeou became the first current or former
Taiwanese leader to [visit the mainland]{.mark}]{.underline} since
Taiwan broke away in 1949, and during his visit he spoke of the "common
inheritance of blood, language, history and culture" between the two
sides, raising hopes in Beijing that reunification can still be achieved
without risking a potentially catastrophic conflict. In short,
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [wants to be]{.underline} (at least
perceived as) **[a peacemaker]{.underline}**, and though Taiwan's future
remains of far more importance to him that any of these issues, [China's
president is **[unlikely to reverse]{.mark}**]{.underline} all these
[**[diplomatic victories]{.mark}** by stumbling into a costly
war]{.underline}.

There are more basic reasons why China is unlikely to move against
Taiwan soon. [Xi has [watched]{.mark}]{.underline} carefully
[as]{.underline} Russia's President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} has [provided a vivid demonstration
of]{.underline} just [how [**unpredictable, costly**, and
**humiliating**]{.mark} an ill-conceived [war]{.mark} can be. Taiwan,
backed with generations of]{.underline} sophisticated and powerful
[American weapons, has been preparing]{.underline} for a possible
Chinese invasion [even longer than Ukraine]{.underline} has prepped for
a full-frontal assault from Russia, and [[given]{.mark} the]{.underline}
complete [[lack of]{.mark} Chinese [combat experience]{.mark}
over]{.underline} the past [44 years, [Xi]{.mark}
[understands]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[the risks of [Pyrrhic
victory]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[or]{.underline}** even of
**[defeat]{.underline}** -- **[are real]{.underline}**. At a time [when
China is [emerging from]{.mark}]{.underline} the world's most draconian
lockdown and [its worst economic [slowdown]{.mark} in decades, Xi is
[likely to be **extra careful**]{.mark} **about the fights he
picks**]{.underline}. At least for now.

There's also the critical issue of semiconductors. About [90 percent
of]{.underline} the world's most sophisticated [computer chips are made
in Taiwan]{.underline}. Aware of the risk this creates, China, the U.S.,
and others are working as quickly as possible to lessen the risk of
economic catastrophe that would result if that production were
dramatically slowed or even halted, but self-sufficiency in chip
production is years away for every country. [China is [loath to
risk]{.mark} conflict that would leave [its economy]{.mark} without
access to the]{.underline} 21st century's [most important economic
resource]{.underline}.

One day, China may invade Taiwan, triggering a war with global
implications. But that day isn't soon. When and if it does, the [timing
will be determined by]{.underline} China's leader, not as the result of
any diplomatic provocation, but by his own calculation of [benefit and
cost]{.underline}. For now, it's still possible to hope that **[[cooler
heads]{.mark} can]{.underline}** one day **[[find a diplomatic
solution]{.underline}]{.mark}** to avert a war that would have
disastrous implications far beyond Asia.
