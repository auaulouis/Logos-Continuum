## Notes 

Human activity in the Arctic releases viruses, bacteria, and
micro-organisms that have been frozen in the ice for hundreds of
thousands of years, if not longer. They call these "methuselah
micro-organisms" and they are terrifying. The general link is pretty
linear, predicated on human activity disturbing the permafrost that
contains these diseases, but each Aff also has its own little route in
additional to this link.

You may notice some heavy overlap with some cards from the Arctic Thaw
DA, because permafrost thaw is one of the internal links to the impact.
If you like the Arctic Thaw DA or just want to mix things up, the 2
arguments are [VERY]{.underline} compatible together.

[Top Level\-\--Impact]{.underline}

The impact is pretty self-explanatory but don't forget you have 2
closely related but distinct options to go for.

> 1\. Ancient diseases themselves\-\--strains of smallpox, influenza,

INTRODUCTION

The Arctic region is undergoing rapid and unprecedented changes due to
global warming with average increasing by more than 2°C since the 1950s,
which is twice as fast as the global average. This has led to the
melting of glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost, which are key components
of the Arctic ecosystem and climate system \[1\]. [**Permafrost** is the
permanently frozen ground that lies beneath much of the **Arctic land
surface**. This thick layer of [permafrost]{.mark} is [being
**disrupted**]{.mark} as Arctic temperatures are rising, which [has
**dramatic consequences for human society**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such
as exacerbating climate change by releasing greenhouse gases from the
decomposition of previously trapped organic material and [endangering
human health by [triggering the **metabolic reactivation of**]{.mark}
**various microorganisms**]{.underline} \[1,2\]. [These pathogens have
been trapped beneath this layer for nearly **500,000 years** and pose a
**serious threat if released** into the environment. One of the most
intriguing and alarming aspects of permafrost thawing is the possibility
of **reviving [ancient viruses]{.mark}** that have been frozen for
**millennia**]{.underline} \[3\]. [These viruses, also known as **zombie
viruses** or **[Methuselah microbes]{.mark}**, have been inactive for a
long time, but [could]{.mark} be **reactivated** by the Earth's warming
climate and [cause a **major disease outbreak**]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[4, 5\]. Researchers have already isolated some strains of these zombie
viruses and demonstrated that they are still capable of infecting host
cells, even though they have been buried in permafrost for thousands of
years. These viruses could infect humans with diseases from the distant
past that our immune systems may have never encountered, and that could
be resistant to current treatments \[4\]. Therefore, these viruses
represent a potential pandemic threat that needs to be monitored and
controlled.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

The aim of this short article is to provide an overview of the current
state of knowledge on the zombie viruses, their origin, diversity,
infectivity, and impact on human health and the environment along with
the challenges and opportunities for monitoring, prevention, and control
of these emerging pathogens, as well as the role of social media and
public education in raising awareness and combating misinformation.
ORIGIN, DIVERSITY, AND INFECTIVITY The term zombie virus refers to
viruses that have been inactive for a long time, but could be revived by
environmental changes. The term is also used in fiction to describe a
pathogen that transforms humans into undead creatures that spread the
infection by biting. It is a metaphor for the unknown and the mysterious
in infectious disease fiction, as well as an allegory of a communicable
disease that serve as a symbol of the sick or the disease in their
horde-like behaviour and reveals the patterns of contagion and the
disaster among communities. The origin of the zombie viruses is not
clear, but scientists believe that they may have been frozen in the
permafrost during the last ice age, which lasted from about 2.6 million
years ago to about 11,700 years ago. During this period, the Earth
experienced several cycles of glacial and interglacial periods, which
affected the climate, the sea level, and the distribution of life forms.
The permafrost formed as a result of the accumulation of snow and ice
that did not melt during the summer, and that preserved the organic
matter and the microorganisms that were trapped within it. The
permafrost may contain viruses that are up to a million years old and so
will be far older than our own species, which is thought to have emerged
about 300,000 years ago \[6\]. "Our immune systems may have never been
in contact with some of those microbes, and that is another worry," said
Jean-Michel Claverie, a geneticist from Aix-Marseille University who has
been studying the zombie viruses \[7\]. The diversity of the zombie
viruses is also unknown, but researchers have identified several
different viral strains from various sites in Siberia and other regions
of the Arctic. These viruses belong to different families and genera,
such as Pandoravirus, Pithovirus, Megavirus, and Pacmanvirus, which are
among the largest and most complex viruses known to science. They have
genomes that range from 500,000 to 2.5 million base pairs, which is
larger than some bacteria and archaea, along with some unique
morphological features, such as icosahedral or amphora-shaped capsids,
and unusual replication cycles, such as infecting the host cell nucleus
or forming viral factories in the cytoplasm. These viruses are mainly
found to infect single-celled organisms, such as amoebae, which are
abundant and diverse in the permafrost. However, some of these viruses
may also have the potential to infect multicellular organisms, such as
plants, animals, and humans. For example, researchers have detected
genomic traces of poxviruses and herpesviruses, which are well known
human pathogens, in some of the permafrost samples. In 2018, researchers
recovered microscopic nematode worms that were frozen in Siberian soil
for 42,000 years. The researchers confirmed that the animals that moved
and ate after being placed in nutrient-rich Petri dishes at 20 °C were
not contaminated samples \[8\]. The infectivity of the zombie viruses is
also uncertain, but researchers have demonstrated that some of them are
still able to infect host cells after being frozen for thousands of
years. For example, Claverie and his team isolated a virus that was
48,500 years old from a permafrost sample in Siberia, and showed that it
could still infect an amoeba species called Acanthamoeba castellanii
\[7\]. This virus, named Pandoravirus yedoma, is the oldest frozen virus
to become infectious. It is older than the 30,000-year-old virus
identified in Siberia in 2013, which was also isolated by Claverie\'s
team \[7\]. The researchers used Acanthamoeba as a virus bait, as it is
a common host for many large viruses. They also used strict biosafety
measures to prevent contamination and spread of the viruses to the
laboratory workers and the environment which emphasized that the viruses
they isolated were only able to infect amoebae and posed no risk to
humans. However, they warned that other viruses, currently frozen in the
permafrost, might be able to trigger illnesses in humans. "We have to
assume that something like this could happen," said Dr. Marion Koopmans,
a virologist from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam who has been
collaborating with Claverie \[9\]. To investigate the diversity and
function of these ancient viruses, a team of researchers led by Dr.
Lonnie Thompson and Dr. Matthew Sullivan from Ohio State University
conducted a metagenomic analysis of two ice core samples collected from
the Guliya ice cap on the Tibetan Plateau, which is located at an
altitude of 6.7 kilometers and has an estimated age of 15,000 years
\[10\]. The researchers used a combination of advanced techniques, such
as sterile drilling, decontamination, and ultra-low temperature
processing, to minimize the risk of contamination and preserve the
integrity of the samples. The team found that the ice cores contained a
rich and diverse viral community, with 33 viral populations identified,
of which 28 were novel and had no close relatives in the public
databases \[10\]. They then compared the viral genomes to those of known
viruses and inferred their possible hosts and functions which allowed
them to discover that the most abundant viruses in both samples were
bacteriophages that infect Methylobacterium, a genus of bacteria that
plays a key role in the methane cycle within ice. These phages showed
high similarity to those found in Methylobacterium strains from plant
and soil habitats, suggesting that they originated from terrestrial
sources and were transported to the ice cap by dust and wind \[10\]. The
researchers also found that these phages had genes that could enhance
the nutrient uptake and metabolism of their hosts, indicating that they
had a mutualistic relationship with the bacteria which enabled them to
also characterize the novel viruses and find that they had unique
features that enabled them to survive and infect cells in extreme cold
environments. These features included signatures of genes that encode
for cold-shock proteins, antifreeze proteins, ice-nucleation proteins,
and cold-adapted enzymes. It was speculated that these viruses were
adapted to the harsh conditions of the ice cap and could infect
psychrophilic (coldloving) microorganisms. The researchers concluded
that these ancient viruses provide a valuable window into the past
atmospheric and environmental conditions, as well as the evolutionary
history of viruses. They also warned that the melting of the ice cap
could pose a potential threat to the current biosphere, as some of the
viruses may be able to infect humans or other animals. This calls for
more research and surveillance on the emerging viruses from the
permafrost, as they may have unpredictable consequences for the global
health and ecology.

IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT

[[The impact]{.mark} of the zombie viruses on human health and the
environment]{.underline} is not yet fully understood, but it [[could
be]{.mark} **significant and [devastating]{.mark}** and could cause [a
**new global medical emergency**]{.mark}, not by an illness new to
science, but [by a **disease from the**]{.mark} **distant
[past]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These viruses could infect humans with
diseases [that we have **no immunity or treatment for**]{.mark}, such as
an **[ancient form of polio, smallpox, or
influenza]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[11\]. [They could also [introduce
**new genetic elements**]{.mark} or [**resistance factors** into the
**existing** microbial populations]{.mark}, which could affect their
**evolution and adaptation**]{.underline} \[12\]. This could also alter
the ecological balance and the biogeochemical cycles of the Arctic
region, which will have global implications. [[The]{.mark} zombie
[viruses]{.mark} could be [released]{.mark} into the environment
[by]{.mark} various factors, such as [**permafrost thawing**,
**mining**, **drilling**, **construction**, **tourism**, and
**migration**]{.mark}. Permafrost thawing is the main factor that could
expose these viruses to the outside world]{.underline}, as it is driven
by climate change and affects a large area of the Arctic. [It not only
releases the viruses, but also other pathogens, such as bacteria and
fungi, that have been frozen for a long time along with organic matter,
such as plant and animal remains, that decomposes]{.underline} and emits
greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which further
contribute to climate change and permafrost thawing. [Permafrost
[thawing]{.mark} also [affects the]{.mark} physical and chemical
[properties of the soil,]{.mark} the [water, and]{.mark} the [air,
which]{.mark} could [affect the **survival and transmission** of
the]{.mark} zombie [viruses]{.mark} and other
microorganisms]{.underline}. However it is not the only factor that
could release the zombie viruses into the environment. [[Human
activities]{.mark}, such as mining, drilling, construction, tourism, and
migration, could also [**disturb the permafrost** and **expose**
the]{.mark} zombie [viruses to the **outside
world**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[These activities]{.mark} could [also
**increase the contact and the exposure** of humans and animals to the
viruses]{.mark} and other microorganisms, [which]{.mark} could
[facilitate the **infection and the spread** of the
diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in 2016, an anthrax outbreak
occurred in Siberia, killing more than 2,300 reindeer and infecting
dozens of people, including a 12-year-old boy who died \[6\]. The
outbreak was linked to the thawing of a reindeer carcass that was
infected with anthrax and buried in the permafrost for decades. The
carcass was exposed by the melting of the permafrost and the rising of
the water level, and the anthrax spores were dispersed by the wind and
the water. The outbreak was also facilitated by the high density and the
movement of the reindeer herds, as well as the lack of vaccination and
the delay in the diagnosis and the treatment of the infected people and
animals. The outbreak was contained by the intervention of the
authorities, who vaccinated the reindeer and the people, and burned the
carcasses and the contaminated soil \[6\]. This was a wake-up call for
the potential dangers of permafrost thawing and the need for
preparedness and prevention.

Introduction: The lingering danger of a post-antibiotic era

Antibiotic resistance is on the rise and humanity is currently heading
towards [[a **post-antibiotic era**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although this
scenario is unlikely to lead to the complete extinction of humanity, it
[[poses an **existential threat**]{.mark}, as one of the most important
means of fighting infections would then have become
**ineffective**]{.underline}, resulting in the death of millions of
people. Despite the fact that international bodies such as the World
Health Organization have put this issue on the global political agenda,
it continues to grow as problem. However, the actual danger posed by
antibiotic resistance, which is essentially of anthropogenic origin
(Mitchell et al. 2019: 1), does currently not correspond to its
recognition as an immediate threat to humanity on a social, or more
precisely on a societal level. Not even notorious catchwords like
"superbugs" (Stolberg 1998) seem to be enough to bring the issue into
public awareness. As of now, "warnings and crisis framings do not appear
sufficient to prompt a response. Public attention and governmental
action have lagged." (Engström 2021: 19).

[A post-antibiotic era is, simply put, "[a new era in which bacteria
have become resistant to existing antibiotics and]{.mark} the
antibiotics **[no longer work]{.mark}**."]{.underline} (Hansson/Brenthel
2022: 381). Like some other current and anticipated future crises, such
as the climate crisis, [**[a]{.mark}**nti**[b]{.mark}**iotic
**[r]{.mark}**esistance is [develop]{.mark}ing [day by day beyond
our]{.mark} collective **[perception]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This lack
of awareness could make the current antibiotic crisis even more
dangerous, as the absence of adequate threat perception is likely to
reduce the willingness to tackle the problem. Picking up on these
aspects, the guiding thesis of the paper at hand is, that, contrary to
their widespread perception, [**[a]{.mark}**nti**[b]{.mark}**iotic
**[r]{.mark}**esistance [and]{.mark} the [**post-antibiotic age** are an
**existential danger to humanity** in form of a **global and
intergenerational threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The arguments to
substantiate this claim are unfolded in three main steps: First, we will
give an overview of the role of antibiotics and the occurring resistance
in modern medicine. Building on this and taking a global perspective, we
will highlight the current scope of the problem and elaborate on the
prognosis of its future escalation, revealing the intergenerational
nature of the issue at hand. Afterwards, we will focus on potential
attempts to tackle antibiotic resistance and prevent a post-antibiotic
era by elaborating on the possibility of a way out and its obstacles,
before concluding the proposed arguments.

Risks to human populations

As of 2017, approximately 3million people in the high northern latitudes
lived on permafrost, where degradation imperils local infrastructure and
increases the risk of exposure to emergent constituents175. As the new
Arctic evolves, increasing pollution, shipping, natural resource
exploitation, tourism and population growth leave resident communities
vulnerable to even small ecosystem disruptions125,177,178.

Antibiotic resistance. [Deep [permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline} (\>3m) [is
one of the few environments on Earth that [has **not been exposed**
to]{.mark} modern [antibiotics, yet **antibiotic-resistant bacteria**
are **prevalent**]{.mark} in these soil horizons]{.underline}179--181.
[In Siberia, over 100 diverse microorganisms]{.underline}, including
Firmicutes, Arthrobacter and Bacteroidetes, [were determined to be
**resistant** to aminoglycoside, tetracycline and chloramphenicol
antibiotics]{.underline}181 (Table 1). [These antibiotic-resistant
bacteria were identified in permafrost dated 15--290ka, with species
even more abundant in active layers in older, deeper
permafrost]{.underline}181,182. Subsequently, [[concerns]{.mark} have
been raised [about]{.mark} the [potential for the **exchange of genetic
material between a**]{.mark}**nti[b]{.mark}iotic-[r]{.mark}esistant
[permafrost microorganisms and contemporary bacteria to create new
a]{.mark}nti[b]{.mark}iotic-[r]{.mark}esistant
[strains]{.mark}**]{.underline}183. To date, [bacteria resistant to
chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tetracycline,
spectinomycin and neomycin have been recovered from permafrost
soils]{.underline}18,184.

Pathogen emergence. [Changing Arctic ecology combined with permafrost
[thaw **raises the prospect of disease emergence**. Stable
conditions]{.mark} in permafrost [have **preserved**]{.mark} fragmented
genomic material from [**smallpox** and **influenza** viruses,
pre-dating the first known human]{.mark} smallpox [case]{.mark} by over
1 kyr]{.underline} (ref. 61). While these viruses may not be preserved
in infectious forms, [recovery and reconstruction of viral genomes is
ongoing]{.underline}185,186. The release of intact viral pathogens from
permafrost are limited by host community density and longevity,
preventing long-term persistence for many virus species. However, [any
potential research reconstructing ancient viruses must be weighed
against the **risks of release or mutation**]{.underline}185,187. As the
pathogenic risks from all Methuselah microorganisms and viruses are not
fully characterized, laboratory security is critical.

Although the direct infection of humans from permafrost pathogens is
currently improbable, [questions abounded after a **[2016 outbreak of
anthrax]{.mark}** in Russia]{.underline}188,189. [The hardy endospores
of anthrax]{.underline} (Bacillus anthracis) [endure entombment within
permafrost for decades to centuries, [rais]{.mark}ing [concerns about
**re-emergence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the 2016 outbreak was most
likely a result of reindeer overpopulation and undervaccination,
increasing vector transfer potential is a growing concern20,189,190.
[Similarly, a **new pox virus** termed **Alaskapox** has recently been
identified in the Alaskan Arctic, with its **origins, rate of spread and
risk of illness still poorly quantified**]{.underline}191.

#### [Risk]{.underline} of ABR means the disease impact must be [prioritized]{.underline} and weighed above [everything]{.underline} else, COVID proves the threat. The link and impact are [linear]{.underline}\-\--the [more]{.underline} Arctic [activity]{.underline} the Aff creates, the more [likely]{.underline} a novel pandemic is to [occur]{.underline} and the more [harmful]{.underline} it will be.

The most likely types of pathogens that would be able to survive in
permafrost, and therefore arguably pose the greatest risk, are those
that can form spores (e.g., fungal pathogens, Anthraxcausing bacterium
B.anthracis, and species of Clostridium bacteria that cause tetanus and
botulism; C.tetani and C.botulinum, respectively \[4, 7, 28, 32\]).
[Given [**antibiotics** are]{.mark} likely to be [the **main line of
defence**]{.mark} against infection by spore-forming bacteria, we must
carefully consider whether bacteria from **permafrost** can be
effectively treated with current antibiotics.
**[A]{.mark}**nti**[b]{.mark}**iotic or **a**nti**m**icrobial
**[r]{.mark}**esistance is a major growing concern for public health
globally, as more and more bacteria evolve to survive exposure to
multiple drugs, **[render]{.mark}ing [conventional medical treatments
less effective]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[37, 38\]. [It is dangerous to
assume that [bacteria lying dormant in permafrost]{.mark} have not yet
evolved resistance to current antibiotics, since research has suggested
that some bacteria, isolated in caves for tens of thousands of years,
[demonstrated resistance to over **18 modern antibiotics**]{.mark} --
most likely gained through competition with fungi that naturally produce
antibiotics]{.underline} \[39\].

Future risks and policy implications

Whilst the current likelihood of the release of a contagious pathogen
from permafrost is likely to be low at present, the current
[**[Covid]{.mark}-19** pandemic [demonstrates the need to take the risk
of]{.mark} such an [occurrence **seriously**. Increasing]{.mark} levels
of [**human contact** with **thawing permafrost**]{.mark} directly
driven by climate change, [as well as **increased oil, gas, and mineral
extraction** in the Arctic]{.mark} circle, [will only increase the
**chance** of **pathogens** being released]{.mark} from thawing
permafrost. In particular, [the evidence suggests]{.mark} that [the
likelihood of]{.mark} localised [outbreaks]{.mark} due to spore-driven
pathogens, that cause diseases [such as **Anthrax**]{.mark}, is at least
moderate and [should be taken **extremely
seriously**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

However, with increased preparedness, monitoring, and surveillance, the
threat from such pathogens could be minimised to a great extent. For
example, pre-emptive monitoring and surveillance to detect Anthrax
outbreaks should be targeted towards the 13,885 cattle burial grounds
scattered across northern Russia \[6, 28\], whilst local and historical
records can be used to identify more high-risk sites in other parts of
the Arctic Circle (e.g., in Scandinavia and North America). The same
approach is also likely to be useful for identifying old sites of mass
graves for the bubonic plague and Spanish flu using historical records.
Early monitoring and surveillance in high-risk areas could catch
dangerous pathogens before they become a serious problem.

Such monitoring and surveillance should also consider human exploitation
of the Arctic Circle for oil, gas, and mineral extraction, which may
lead to novel pathogen exposure events. Organisations need to
acknowledge the biosecurity risks involved in undertaking these
activities and ensure adherence to strict biosecurity protocols, so that
risk is minimised for humans in contact with permafrost soils.
Ultimately, to ensure organisations are held accountable for their
actions, local and international laws may need to be considered to
regulate activities in the Arctic Circle from a biosecurity perspective
\[40--42\].

Effective surveillance and monitoring for potential outbreaks will
require strong cooperation between local and international public health
organisations (such as the World Health Organisation (WHO)), and between
governments of countries where most of the Northern Hemisphere's
permafrost exists (i.e., the USA, Canada, Russia, Norway, Finland, and
Sweden \[40--42\]). Whilst such cooperation may be challenging, the
consequences of being unprepared to contain and respond to developing
outbreaks of novel pathogens from permafrost could represent a serious
threat for the global economy and society, as demonstrated by Covid19.
Therefore, it is in the mutual interests of all nations to cooperate in
the monitoring and surveillance of novel pathogen outbreaks from
permafrost.

It is also important to acknowledge that pathogens have been previously
used to manufacture and test biological weapons (mostly by governments
in relation to Anthrax-causing B.anthracis pre- and post-World War II
\[43\], but also more recently in a 2001 attack via letters in the US
postal system \[44\]). Therefore, there is clearly potential for groups
or organisations with malicious intent to extract and modify
microorganisms frozen in permafrost for dangerous agendas and purposes
\[45--50\], making strong international cooperation and leadership from
the WHO even more important in this regard.

Ultimately, tackling the climate crisis and limiting global warming
according to the Paris Agreement will help to address the major driver
behind permafrost thawing and potential release of pathogens. The risk
posed by thawing permafrost, on top of the myriad of threats already
posed by climate change, should inspire all nations to take their
commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions seriously.

Conclusion

[[The more that human civilisation **extracts** and **exposes**
permafrost]{.mark} directly or indirectly through physical
**exploitation** or **climate change**, [the greater the likelihood that
**novel pathogens** may be released and cause **death and
disease**]{.mark} in human, animal and plant populations.
[**Underestimating** the threat]{.mark} of novel pathogens from unusual
sources [has been shown to carry **serious consequences for all human
civilisation**]{.mark}, as demonstrated by the Covid-19
pandemic]{.underline}. Although the likelihood of a pandemic caused by
pathogens in permafrost is relatively low compared to zoonoses (e.g.,
Covid-19), the risks posed by permafrost-related pathogens must be taken
seriously. Creating and implementing appropriate biosecurity management
plans in areas of greatest risk could save many lives and livelihoods.
The effectiveness of these plans at controlling any outbreaks from
permafrost will ultimately depend on strong international cooperation
and regulation by public health organisations and governments.

The [rise in Arctic temperatures has intensified the melting and retreat
of sea ice, the reduction in snow cover, and the thawing of permafrost
in the Arctic region]{.underline} \[ 3-- 6\]. The areas of sea that have
been covered by thick ice year-round are gradually transforming into
ice-free or thin-ice regions. The rate of decline in Arctic sea ice
extent in September has a range from 0.015 × 106 km2/year to 0.049 × 106
km2/year during 1979--1998 but has accelerated to the range from 0.116 ×
106 km2/year to 0.192 × 106 km2/year during 1999--2010 \[7, 8\]. During
2013--2019, the mean annual extent of Arctic sea ice decreased from 9.23
× 106 km2 to 8.51 × 106 km2, with an annual decline rate of 1.34% \[9\].
In addition, [[Arctic sea ice **thickness** is]{.mark} also
[experiencing **rapid changes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to
satellite data, between 2003 and 2018, the volume of Arctic sea ice
decreased by 5130 km3 per decade during the autumn and by 2870 km3 per
decade during the winter. Furthermore, the mean sea ice thickness in
some areas of the Arctic decreased by 2 m over a period of 60 years
(1958--2018) \[ 10 \]. [The reduction in sea ice thickness and coverage
in the Arctic region has led to a continuous [increase in open water
areas and an **extension** of the summer **melting season**]{.mark}.
Therefore, the Arctic shipping routes have a longer navigational period,
greatly enhancing their navigational potential]{.underline} \[ 11 ,12
\]. The development of Arctic shipping routes has close connections with
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Climate Action, Life
Below Water, and Affordable and Clean Energy \[13\]. [The Arctic
Passage, which connects the North Pacific and the North Atlantic, serves
as a maritime shortcut]{.underline} \[14 \]. [It is typically separated
into the **Northern Sea Route** (NSR), the Northwest Passage (NWP), and
the Transpolar Sea Route (TSR) that crosses the North Pole. The Northern
Sea Route is along the offshore waters of northern Russia, connecting
Asia and Europe.]{.underline} [It is the least ice-covered and most
navigable of the three Arctic rout]{.underline}es and is divided into
four routes by latitude: low-latitude, mid-latitude, high-latitude, and
near-polar routes \[15 -- 17\]. Compared to the traditional Suez Canal
route, the Northern Sea Route can shorten the journey by 15% to 50% \[
18 -- 22\]. The Transpolar Sea Route, which crosses the North Pole, is
the shortest sea route connecting the North Pacific and North Atlantic
\[ 19 \], but it is often heavily ice-covered, making navigation
difficult, and currently has low feasibility for navigation. The
Northwest Passage is along the Arctic coast of Alaska, the Canadian
Arctic Archipelago, and the Davis Strait, connecting Asia and eastern
North America. In 2020, the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment
Working Group released the Arctic shipping status report, which
suggested that Arctic shipping had increased by 25% from 2013 to 2019
\[23 ,24 \]. Against the background of global climate change, the future
planning and navigational potential of the Arctic shipping routes will
be of great concern. Compared with the Northern Sea Route, the Northwest
Passage has heavier sea ice conditions and less developed navigation
infrastructure, making it more difficult to navigate \[ 18 , 19\]. In
addition, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago has complex coastlines, narrow
waterways, and limited spatiotemporal observed sea ice data in the
region. Furthermore, the Transpolar Sea Route is adjacent to the
near-polar route of the Northern Sea Route. Therefore, this study
focuses on the Northern Sea Route, which currently has the highest
navigability, and the Transpolar Sea Route, which has the greatest
potential for future navigation, to conduct research on future route
changes and navigation potential estimation. Currently, most studies of
Arctic sea ice and Arctic shipping prediction rely on models \[18 , 25--
38\]. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) has
gathered the latest prediction data of climate models. It is better
suited to the current global warming background than the CMIP5 model
data due to the incorporation of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) \[
37 \]. The Arctic sea ice prediction data provided by CMIP6 under
various scenarios can reduce the uncertainty of future prediction data
and better represent the changing trend of Arctic sea ice in the future.
Sea ice concentration and thickness are two important parameters for
planning Arctic shipping routes and assessing navigational potential,
and their accuracy significantly affects the reliability of future
estimates for Arctic shipping. However, there has been limited research
on the accuracy of CMIP6 sea ice data. Watts et al. conducted an
evaluation of the historical data of sea ice concentration and thickness
between 1979 and 2014 from 13 CMIP6 climate models, utilizing ICESat and
CryoSat-2 satellite data \[ 35\]. Similarly, Shen et al. compared the
sea ice concentration historical data of CMIP6 and CMIP5 with
observational data and evaluated the performance of 36 CMIP6 models
during 1979--2014 \[ 38\]. Both studies presented a clear demonstration
of the differences between CMIP6 models and observational data, enabling
a comprehensive assessment of their performance. In addition, the
current studies related to Arctic shipping routes based on CMIP6 sea ice
data are primarily conducted using the multi-model mean (MMM). Li et al.
con- ducted an assessment of the navigability of Arctic shipping routes
from 2015 to 2065 using 16 models \[29 \]. Their findings revealed that
three feasible shipping scenarios demonstrated a significant reduction
in navigation risk starting from 2045, but this result was only
applicable to the SSP5-8.5 scenario (very high greenhouse gas emissions:
CO2 emissions triple by 2075). Chen et al. predicted a significant
increase and extension of navigable areas and navigable windows during
2045--2055, but further navigability assessments were lacking \[27 \].
Wei et al. conducted an analysis of the navigation probability and route
changes of the Arctic Passage by the end of the 21st century using the
Arctic Transport Accessibility Model (ATAM) \[ 36 \]. Their study
utilized the MMM to predict the future conditions of the Arctic under
the SSP2-4.5 (intermediate GHG emissions: CO2 emissions around current
levels until 2050, then falling but not reaching net zero by 2100) and
SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The study predicted that the Arctic will be ice-free
in September by 2076 and 2055 under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios,
respectively, enabling navigation through the Transpolar Sea Route. Min
et al. conducted an analysis of the changes in the navigation potential
of Arctic shipping between 2021 and 2100 using the ATAM \[ 31\]. The
results of the study, based on the MMM, indicated that the navigable
area for Open Water (OW) and Polar Class 6 (PC6) is expected to continue
to increase in September before 2050 under both the SSP2-4.5 and
SSP5-8.5 scenarios. However, similar to the study of Wei et al. \[ 36
\], both studies did not conduct further detailed analysis of route
planning. Moreover, the results of the MMM do not clearly depict the
route planning and navigation potential evaluation results of different
models, and they are also inadequate for comparing the similarities and
differences between the results of different models. Furthermore, the
sea ice thickness division of ATAM, which has been commonly employed in
previous studies, is relatively coarse. In this study, the seven models
with better performances were selected based on the sea ice
concentration and thickness data evaluation results of various models in
CMIP6 from Watts et al. \[35 \] and Shen et al. \[ 38\], and the
CMCC-ESM2 model with relatively large differences of sea ice
concentration and thickness was also added as a comparison. Based on the
Polar Operational Limit Assessment Risk Indexing System (POLARIS) with
more detailed sea ice thickness classification (IMO, 2016), the
navigational risk of each model was quantified under two scenarios
(SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5), represented by two types of vessels, Open Water
(OW) and Polar Class 6 (PC6), and the navigability of each model was
evaluated and analyzed from multiple perspectives to find out the
similarities and differences between the models and to comprehensively
predict the changes in Arctic shipping routes and navigability potential
in the next 30 years. 2. Data and Methods 2.1. CMIP6 Sea Ice Data Based
on the evaluation results of sea ice concentration and thickness from
Watts et al. \[ 35\] and Shen et al. \[ 38 \], this study utilizes
monthly sea ice concentration and thickness data with the better
performances obtained from seven climate models, including ACCESS-
ESM1-5, CESM2-WACCM, EC-Earth3-CC, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, NorESM2-MM,
and UKESM1-0-LL. The CMCC-ESM2 model with smaller simulation results of
sea ice concentration and thickness was additionally utilized as a
comparison (Table 1). CMIP6 data show that [[there will be completely
ice-free months in the Arctic **before 2050**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[ 39
\], [[and **30 years before** 2050 is the period with the **largest
change in**]{.mark} **navigation [potential]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[
29, 33 \]. Therefore, this study focuses on the period between 2021 and
2050, [with a particular emphasis on the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}
and the Transpolar Sea Route (Figure 1). The SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5
scenarios are selected for this research. Due to the difference in grid
resolution in the CMIP6 models, we employed the inverse distance
weighting (IDW) interpolation technique to convert the model data grids
into a consistent grid size with a resolution of 12.5 km × 12.5 km.

On its current path, humanity is heading for a future escalation of the
problems described, which will not only lead to poorer health care and
an increase in the number of deaths, but [also to **[severe economic
consequences]{.mark}**, as "[\[t\]he impact of **AMR** on economic
growth will result in a pronounced increase in **extreme

prominent projection must be taken with caution, especially because of
its rather speculative nature due to the opaque methodology (Kraker et

be dismissed entirely. One may reasonably disagree about the extent of
the problem, but its current trajectory is crystal clear: Humanity is
not putting enough effort into addressing the problem of antibiotic
resistance and averting the scenario of a post-antibiotic era (Engström
2021: 21). Since our current handling of antibiotics and antibiotic
resistance have a very significant impact on the future, this becomes
not only a long-term issue, but also a question of intergenerational
justice. For as medically and morally defensible as some of our current
antibiotic use may be, it (re)imposes the extreme vulnerability to
bacterial infections that has plagued humanity for most of its existence
on future generations. The danger is imminent, because „if we allow
resistance to increase, in a few decades we may start dying from the
most commonplace of ailments that can today be treated easily." (Davies

Additionally, it would provide quarantine and expert medical treatment

Several [**[epidemics]{.mark}**, such as the Black Death and the Spanish
flu, have [threaten]{.mark}ed **[human life]{.mark}** throughout
history; however, it is unclear if humans will remain safe from the
sudden and fast spread of epidemic diseases]{.underline}. Moreover, [the
[transmission **characteristics**]{.mark} of epidemics
[remain]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[undiscovered]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
this study, [we present]{.underline} the results of [an epidemic
**simulation experiment** revealing the relationship between epidemic
**parameters** and **pandemic risk**]{.underline}. To analyze the
time-dependent risk and impact of epidemics, we considered two
parameters for infectious diseases: the recovery time from infection and
the transmission rate of the disease. Based on the epidemic simulation,
we identified two important aspects of human safety with regard to the
threat of a pandemic. First, humans should be safe if the fatality rate
is below 100%. Second, even when the fatality rate is 100%, humans would
be safe if the average degree of human social networks is below a
threshold value. Nevertheless, certain [[**diseases**
can]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [**[infect]{.mark} all nodes** in
the [human]{.mark} social **[networks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
[these]{.underline} diseases [cause a pandemic when the average degree
is larger than the threshold value.]{.underline}
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} results indicated that certain infectious
[diseases [lead to **human extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline} and can be
prevented by minimizing human contact. 1. Introduction [The emergence of
a **pandemic** is]{.underline} one of the various scenarios frequently
discussed as [a **human extinction event**]{.underline}, and it is
listed as [one of the global]{.underline} [**catastrophic risks** in
studies regarding the future]{.underline} \[1,2,3\]. In particular,
[several]{.underline} pandemics, [such as]{.underline} [[the **Black
Death**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[4,5\], [Spanish flu]{.underline} \[6\],
and those caused by **[[smallpox]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[7\], severe
acute respiratory syndrome (**[[SARS]{.underline}]{.mark}**) \[8\],
[[and **Ebola**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[9\], [have]{.underline}
[[affected a **large population**]{.underline}]{.mark} [throughout
history. The **[risk]{.mark}** of pandemics]{.underline} [[**increases**
with]{.mark} an increase in population
**[mobility]{.mark}**]{.underline} between cities, nations, and
continents, thereby [[threatening **humankind**]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[10,11,12\]. [It is essential to analyze the **epidemic spread** in
society to **minimize the damage**]{.underline} from epidemic disasters;
however, extinctive epidemic spreading experiments have limitations in
real-world situations, as they predict stochastic effects on the spread
without considering the structure of human society. Network-based
approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations and perform
epidemic spreading simulations by considering the network structure of
numerous real-world connections \[13,14,15\]. These methods use various
models of epidemic spreading, such as the
susceptible--infectious--susceptible (SIS) \[16,17,18\],
susceptible--infectious--recovered (SIR) \[19,20,21\], and Watts
threshold models \[22\]. While these methods are mathematically
convenient, they are epidemiologically unrealistic for various
infections because they require exponentially distributed incubation and
infectious periods \[23,24,25\]. Moreover, previous epidemic studies did
not perform quantitative assessment of the pandemic risk depending on
the network connectivity in individuals and fatality rate of various
diseases \[26\]. In the present study, we applied an SIR epidemic model
to a scale-free network with Monte Carlo simulation to identify the
quantitative relationship between infectious diseases and human
existence. Our fundamental hypothesis states that [when the epidemic
**spreads** to all **nodes**]{.underline} of the network and the
fatality rate is 100%, [it can increase the]{.underline} **[pandemic
risk]{.underline}**. To address this, we initially constructed a
scale-free network to simulate a society. Moreover, for the epidemic
spreading simulation, an SIR model was applied to the network to
describe the immune state of an individual after infection. From the
simulation study, we found that the mean degree of a scale-free network
was an essential factor in determining whether epidemics threaten
humans. This approach provides important insights into epidemic
spreading analysis by investigating the relationship between epidemic
and scale-free network parameters. Furthermore, it highlights the
necessity of determining information flow during an epidemic. 2.
Materials and Methods [We designed an epidemic **simulation
process**]{.underline} to identify the relationship between pandemic
risk and network parameters. This study was performed in four steps
(Figure 1): (i) generating a scale-free network model to reflect
real-world conditions; (ii) applying an SIR model to the scale-free
network for epidemic spreading simulations; (iii) adapting the Monte
Carlo method to reflect the stochastic process in the node status of the
SIR model; and (iv) iteratively performing simulation for every
parameter set and analyzing the results. We have provided the source
code and sample results of epidemic simulation in Supplementary
Materials. Figure 1. Overview of epidemic simulation process based on
the Monte Carlo method. (A) We generated scale-free networks for a fixed
population (N = 1,000,000) and various node degrees (k = 2, 5, 7, and
10). (B) Epidemic spreading was simulated by applying a
susceptible--infectious--recovered (SIR) model to the scale-free
network. We set the epidemic parameters, β and γd. β represents the
spreading rate of epidemics, and γd is the reciprocal of γ and reflects
the time interval between infection and recovery. Randomly, 0.05% of
nodes were initially infected. (C) [We adapted the **Monte Carlo
method** to determine the status of the transition]{.underline} from the
infection node to immunization node. Repeated simulations were performed
until a steady state was achieved. (D) For every parameter set, 10,000
simulations were performed. 2.1. Network Generation Based on a
Scale-Free Model We constructed a network model for the epidemic
spreading simulation (Figure 1). The nodes and edges of the network
represent people in the society and their physical contacts,
respectively. We used a scale-free network model, which follows the
preferential attachment property observed in numerous real-world
networks, such as social networks, physical systems, and economic
networks \[27,28,29\]. In the scale-free network, when a node is added
to the network, its likelihood of connecting to existing nodes increases
with an increase in the node's degree. Hub nodes, which lead to fast and
vast spreading of epidemics, exist. Two characteristic parameters,
including N and k, affect the form of scale-free networks. The parameter
N denotes all nodes in the network. In the real world, N indicates the
whole population size. The parameter k is the average degree of the
network, which determines the degree of the newly attached node for each
step during network generation. Following the characteristics of the
network model, we generated scale-free networks representing human
contacts for epidemic spread. The scale-free network was generated by
the Barabasi--Albert graph distribution, in which the network is
constructed from a cycle graph with three vertices, followed by the
addition of k edges at each construction step \[30\]. The k edges are
randomly attached to the vertex based on the degree distribution of the
vertex. After network generation, we investigated the degree
distribution properties of the network (Figure 2). The results indicate
that the degree distributions have similar tendency for networks with
varying number of nodes and edges. This study constructed scale-free
networks with the largest number of nodes considering computational
complexity (N = 1,000,000). Figure 2. Degree distribution of the
scale-free network. We analyzed the degree distribution of the network
based on the number of nodes (N) and mean degree (k). 2.2. Epidemic
Spreading Based on the SIR Model For the epidemic spreading simulations,
we applied an SIR model to the generated scale-free network. The
classical SIR model can be expressed by the following nonlinear
differential equations \[21\]: where S, I, and R represent susceptible,
infected, and recovered compartments, respectively, in the whole
population. S represents people who have not been infected yet but can
be infected in future. I represents infected people who can spread the
epidemic to susceptible people through physical contact. R denotes
people who have recovered or died from the epidemic and who no longer
participate in the epidemic spreading process. The sum of the S, I, and
R values represents the whole population size N. Epidemics have two
parameters in the SIR model, transmission rate (β) and recovery rate
(γ), which arise from the basic reproduction number R0 (Figure 1B). The
basic reproduction number is the number of infections caused by one
infective node \[31,32,33\]. If the R0 is more than 1, the infection can
spread in a population, whereas if R0 is less than 1, the infection
cannot spread. We express the basic reproduction number as R0 = β/γ,
where β represents the spreading rate of epidemics between infective
nodes and adjacent susceptible nodes and γ represents the probability of
recovery from infection \[34\]. We mainly used γd, which is the
reciprocal of γ and reflects the time interval between infection and
recovery. 2.3. Investigation of Epidemic Status Based on the Monte Carlo
Method The epidemic simulation was performed for a time series event by
constructing epidemic status matrix (z) to represent the status of the
nth node at time step t. For each node, the value of epidemic status
matrix at time step t can be 0, 1, or 2, indicating that a node is
susceptible, infective, or recovered, respectively. We initially (t = 0)
set every value of epidemic status matrix to 0 because all nodes are
susceptible before the epidemic spreads. At the initial infection stage,
randomly selected 0.05% of nodes were infected. At every time period, we
performed immunization and observed the infection stages (Figure 3). At
the immunization stage, we identified infective nodes and determined
whether these nodes would be recovered in the next time step. To
calculate the transition probability of infected and recovered
phenomena, the Monte Carlo method was applied \[35,36\]. When infection
and recovery parameters are provided, it is possible to investigate
whether a node transitions from an epidemic state to another state. To
accomplish this, we compared the method revealing the change in each
population in every compartment over time (Figure 4). The final steady
state of the epidemic spreading simulation model indicates the total
number of casualties of the epidemic who either are dead or have
recovered from the disease. Infective nodes at time t (zn \[t\] = 1) are
transformed to recovered nodes at time t + 1 (zn \[t + 1\] = 2) when
1/γd is larger than a random real number between 0 and 1. We determined
whether the neighbor nodes of the infection node would be infected by
identifying susceptible nodes adjacent to the infective nodes at time t
(zn \[t\] = 0, with the adjacent infective node) (Figure 5). When β is
larger than a random real number between 0 and 1, a susceptible node
becomes an infective node at time t + 1 (zn \[t + 1\] = 1); this
scenario represents epidemic spread. For each time step, we recorded the
number of susceptible, infective, and recovered nodes during epidemic
spread. 2.4. Simulation Parameters We carried out simulation trials for
various mean degrees of networks (k = 2, 5, 7, and 10). Each network
considered the following epidemic parameters: β ranges from 0.05 to 0.95
and γd ranges from 1 to 10. The Monte Carlo model was repeatedly
simulated to observe saturation of the recovery process. Considering
that the simulation pipeline contains random processes such as initial
infection and Monte Carlo trials, we performed the simulation
iteratively until the status of nodes remained unchanged. After
simulation, time series data from every simulation were interpolated in
the time domain. The fatality rate determines the ratio of deceased and
recovered individuals in the final population \[37,38,39\]. If the
fatality rate is below 100%, the recovered population contains both dead
and recovered individuals. Such a situation does not always cause a
pandemic. In this simulation, we assumed a 100% fatality rate. To
accomplish this, we enumerated the recovered nodes as dead for
considering the pandemic risk. 3. Results Through our method, we
obtained epidemic spreading data with various network and epidemic
parameter sets. In the present study, we focused on the case where the
epidemic infects all nodes and defined this phenomenon as "extinctive
spread". [[Diseases causing]{.underline} [**extinctive spread**
are]{.underline}]{.mark} [potential candidates of [high]{.mark} pandemic
**[risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the real world, [extinctive spreading
indicates]{.underline} that the [disease will infect **every person** in
the society]{.underline}. From the simulation data, we calculated the
extinctive spread score by dividing the total number of simulation
trials by the number of extinctive spread cases. Thereafter, we
identified that the number of extinctive spread cases is mainly
influenced by spreading speed, which is determined by β, γd, and k
(Figure 6). The extinctive spread region (brown area in Figure 6) is
expanded as the value of mean degree of network (k) is increased,
thereby indicating that the area of extinctive spread becomes noticeably
wider in a dense network than in a sparse network. Thus, the more
contact between people, the higher the risk of epidemics. Moreover, high
γd and high β cause extinctive spread across a large region, indicating
that the high spreading rate and short time interval between infection
and recovery are risk factors of epidemic diseases. In contrast, the
infective nodes recover before they transmit the disease to their
neighbors in low β and low γd scenarios, thus disconnecting the network
and preventing extinctive spread. This occurs because the infective
nodes need more time to transmit the disease in low β and high γd
scenarios. Therefore, the disease begins to subside due to a lack of new
infective nodes. Furthermore, we investigated the range of β and γd for
existing epidemics of the common cold \[40,41\] and fatal diseases,
namely, cholera \[42,43\], Marburg \[44,45\], Ebola (Congo and Uganda)
\[46,47,48,49\], SARS \[50\], and MERS \[51\] (Table 1). We selected
diseases with relatively well-known epidemic parameters, such as average
duration of infection and basic number of reproductions from previous
studies. Transmission rates were calculated using the mean duration of
infectious periods and basic reproduction numbers of the epidemics.
Different studies reveal multiple values of infectious period and
transmission rate for some of these diseases; we considered these values
separately \[40,41,42,43,46,47,48,49\]. For example, the infectious
period of a common cold is from 3 to 7 days and that of Ebola is 6.5
days. Next, we placed the possible regions of these epidemics as a
disease band for various k values (colored lines in Figure 6). When k \>
5, fatal diseases have an opportunity to cause a pandemic. Even when k =
5, diseases such as cholera and Ebola (Congo) can be threatening in
regions of low γd and high, thus demonstrating that the knowledge of
network parameters of the society and the characteristics of epidemic
diseases can aid in quantifying the risk of epidemics. 4. Discussion
[Many [**previous** studies]{.mark} have made stochastic SIR models to
analyze the dynamics or stability of epidemic diseases]{.underline}.
They investigated the distribution of susceptible, infected, and removed
populations for specific epidemic disease spreading, such as cholera,
SARS, Marburg, and MERS, based on mathematical modelling
\[52,53,54,55\]. [However, they [did **not**]{.mark} conduct a
quantitative assessment of pandemic risk taking into [account **physical
contact** between people]{.mark}]{.underline}. To solve this limitation,
we performed epidemic spreading simulations by applying an SIR model to
scale-free networks with Monte Carlo simulation. In the simulation, [we
consider various connectivity and disease characteristics]{.underline}
on scale-free networks. For each network and epidemic parameter set, the
probability of extinctive spread was calculated. [The [results]{.mark}
**[reveal]{.mark}**ed that **[certain]{.mark} infectious
[diseases]{.mark}** can [lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} extinction.
Moreover, even if the disease band extends over the extinctive spread
regions, it does not indicate that human extinction results from the
disease, as the fatality rate is below 100%; however, in the case of
100% fatality, the disease can cause a human extinction event. The risk
of infectious disease is influenced by the network structure. A dense
network has a higher risk of spreading infectious disease than a sparse
network, as we observed in the extinctive spreading maps. According to
our results, when the average degree of human social networks is below
the risk threshold, i.e., less than 4 in this study, human society is
safe from an extinctive outbreak based on our knowledge regarding the
epidemic parameters of the infectious disease. Nevertheless, in other
cases, **[[human extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** is possible. For
example, if the population is 1,000,000 and there are 4 or more
instances of physical contact between people, human extinction events
may occur, depending on the fatality rate of the epidemics. Hence,
physical contact between people is closely related to an extinction
event of infectious diseases. Eventually, from a public health
perspective, lowering the average contact level of society is an
appropriate way to increase the robustness of strategies against the
occurrence of extinction. In the real world, reducing network density
can be accomplished by epidemic prevention activity, such as isolation
and quarantine treatment. This action prevents epidemic risk to the
society, thereby avoiding human extinction. Additional considerations
may improve our analysis. First, large population size and various
proportions of initial infective nodes were not considered in the
experiments. We have confirmed that the result was consistent when the
proportion of initial infective nodes was 0.05% of the total population;
however, this can vary depending on the distinct proportion of initial
infective nodes in a different population. To achieve robust results, we
need to perform additional experiments for various parameters; however,
we could not address this issue due to computational complexity. Second,
we did not consider numerous known epidemic diseases. We calculated the
transmission rates of epidemic diseases using the known infectious
periods and reproduction numbers of the epidemics from evidence in the
literature. In the present study, we only considered five epidemic
diseases, since the information on infectious periods and reproduction
numbers of diseases was mostly unavailable for other epidemic diseases.
Third, this study only considers the SIR model on scale-free networks in
epidemic simulation. Since the dynamics of epidemic diseases can be
varied in different models or networks, it is important to experiment in
various simulation environments to confirm the robustness of the
results. Nevertheless, these limitations can be considered in future
experiments or using improved computational methods. With these further
improvements, our approach can be used as a computational tool to
analyze the risk of epidemic diseases. 5. Conclusions In this study, we
analyzed the risk of epidemic diseases by creating an epidemic
simulation on a scale-free network. Based on the **[simulation
results]{.underline}** for various epidemic parameters, we
**[confirmed]{.underline}** that [certain infectious **diseases** can
lead to **extinction**]{.underline} and can be prevented by minimizing
human contact. We believe that identifying potential candidate diseases
that may lead to human extinction is crucial in addressing epidemic
prevention activities such as quarantine.

Bacillus anthracis, the agent of **[anthrax]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a

1897-1925, [approximately 1.5 million deer died from anthrax in Northern

the difficulty of digging in the tundra soils \[6\]. Anthrax in humans

Recent [degradation of the cryosphere is reintroducing **ancient
microorganisms** that are highly **adapted** to Arctic conditions.
**Methuselah microorganisms**---organisms with extremotolerant traits
that have the ability to **maintain viability for a million years or
more**---are bringing palaeoecosystem dynamics into the contemporary
Arctic, with unknown consequences]{.underline}10,28,29. As thaw
continues, increased activity from long-dormant microorganisms may
already be contributing to changing Arctic ecosystem processes7,30--32
(Fig. 3). With atmospheric warming driving permafrost thaw from the top
down (referred to as active-layer thickening or gradual thaw), microbial
communities entrained within the permafrost simultaneously force change
from the bottom up33--35 (Fig. 1). This multilevel reorganization
presents an unprecedented alteration to the permafrost ecosystem,
contributing to Arctic change36.

Microbial species from diverse phyla are re-entering an ecosystem that
is already stressed by change and contamination37,38. [Hazardous
compounds **transported** through atmospheric
deposition]{.underline}39,40, [infrastructure leaks]{.underline}5 ,
[accidental release]{.underline}41,42 [and the **thawing
cryosphere**]{.underline}24,39,41,43--47 [can cause **human health
problems** and environmental damage when released. Amplified in the
pristine conditions found across the Arctic, the convergence of climate
change, re-emergence of Methuselah microorganisms and mobilization of
anthropogenic chemicals may be converting the polar north into a
radically different system. **[Our ability to forecast these emergent
risks is limited]{.mark}** by challenges in quantifying where, when, how
fast and how deep permafrost will thaw]{.underline}.

Ancient microbial and viral diversity. Within the Arctic, permafrost is
a reservoir of minimally characterized microbial life48. A single gram
can contain hundreds to thousands of microbial taxa, but the composition
and functionality of permafrost species is poorly sampled49. [The
diversity of microbial and viral species in even small areas of
permafrost is considerable]{.underline}. For example, [[a recent study
recovered **1,907 uncharacterized virus populations**]{.mark} in 197
samples (10--11 cm cores) across a **permafrost thaw** gradient in
Sweden's Stordalen Mire]{.underline}18. [Over [**58%** of these unknown
microorganisms were **still active**]{.mark}]{.underline}, indicating a
diverse virosphere18. Similarly, a team working in Svalbard found that,
within the roots of two species of periglacial ectomycorrhizal plants
(Bistorta vivipara and Salix polaris), [**[25%]{.mark}** of the active
microbial families [were]{.mark} yet
**[unclassified]{.mark}**]{.underline}50.

Furthermore, [**carbon** released by permafrost [thaw can
**intensify**]{.mark} **microorganism [proliferation]{.mark}** [that was
**previously constrained** by temperatures]{.mark} and nutrient
limitations]{.underline}, with unknown results31,34,49,51. This
knowledge gap introduces substantial uncertainty in risk assessment and
forecasting, meaning that [the persistence of Methuselah microorganisms
within modern ecosystems may emerge as an **unfortunate
surprise**]{.underline}. Any re-emergence of Methuselah microorganisms
into the modern Arctic has the potential to change the soil composition,
vegetative growth and community composition---further accelerating the
environmental transition from climate change7,52,53.

Recovered Methuselah viruses and microorganisms. The ability to survive
in extreme environments for extended periods has kept many
microorganisms in permafrost viable, regardless of when they were
deposited. For example, studies in 500-kyr- to 1-Myr-old permafrost
communities have described small populations of non-endospore-forming
bacteria that survived through ongoing DNA repair and lessening cellular
metabolic activity54. In cold methane seeps, ancient bacteria phylotypes
related to Loktanella, Gillisia, Halomonas and Marinobacter spp. were
successfully recovered from temperatures below -5 °C (refs. 55,56),
while microorganisms from Clostridium and Psychrobacter were isolated in
brine lenses from 100-120 ka (Table 1 and Fig. 3)57. In shallower
permafrost, just over 30 ka, intact virus species, including
mimiviruses, pandoraviruses, Pithovirus sibericum and Mollivirus
sibericum, have been identified58,59. More recently, the Glaciecola, a
genus of bacteria that is known for its swift consumption of
phytoplankton organic material, are adapting to increasing temperatures
in cold-water northern fjords by increasing carbon uptake and
turnover49.

Research into the genomic diversity of permafrost microorganisms is an
emergent field, with metagenomics making microbial catalogues and
reconstructions of organisms possible8,49,58,60,61. In a recent example,
the genomes of the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (DNA virus) and the ancient
Northwest Territories cripavirus (aNCV) were resynthesized from a
reindeer faecal deposit entombed within 700-year-old ice62 (Fig. 2). The
revival of nematodes from 30-kyr-old Siberian permafrost and the
recovery of a bdelloid rotifer from 24-kyr-old permafrost demonstrate
that complex, multicellular organisms have also developed effective
survival strategies63.

Adaptations. [[Methuselah microorganisms and viruses have
developed]{.mark} a myriad of [**adaptations** to **survive**]{.mark} in
permafrost [for millennia]{.mark} despite static conditions [in
**subzero temperatures** with **minimal water or

Interactions between emerging hazards in thawing permafrost.

interact, with the potential for partial risk mitigation through
biodegradation146,147. [[**Methuselah microorganisms** may experience

[The **[danger]{.mark}** of this becomes [particularly clear when
considering]{.mark} not only [the **possibility** and **impact** of a
**global spread**]{.mark} of bacterial infections, but also [the
**speed** with which this can happen in a **globalised world**]{.mark}
connected by fast and almost non-stop traffic by land, sea, and
air]{.underline}. Of course, bacterial spread depends on various
factors, such as the respective specificity, overall survivability, and
potency of transmission, but despite this, [in the worst case [such a
spread could become **devastating** for humankind]{.mark}, [as]{.mark}
e.g., the [**plague pandemics** demonstrate **throughout
history**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even without any major hotspots of
bacterial outbursts, it is estimated that there are currently more than
670,000 infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria per year in the
European Union alone, resulting in roughly 33,000 deaths. Globally,
untreatable bacterial infections account for not 700,000 deaths (not:
infections) annually (cf. WHO Regional Office for Europe/European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control 2022: xiv; Antão/Wagner-Ahlfs 2018:
501, Davies et al. 2013: xii). According to recent findings by the
Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators (2022: 629, 639), the problem is
even bigger, with 4.95 million deaths worldwide associated with
antibiotic resistance, of which 1.27 million are directly caused by
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. So although there are some significant
geographical differences, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
currently most threatened by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, antibiotic
resistance is a health problem of global proportions.

Against this background, [it becomes evident that cautionary or alarming
statements according to which "[AMR is a looming threat]{.mark} to the
health of millions of people worldwide"]{.underline} (WHO Regional
Office for Europe/European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
2022: xii) **[do not describe an apocalyptic scenario of a distant
future]{.underline}**. After all, humanity is already in midst of an
antibiotic crisis. As Friedman et al. (2016: 421) remind us, "resistance
and MDR (multiple drug resistance, the authors) bacteria have spread and
the negative impacts of antibiotic resistance have become more apparent"
for decades. Despite the fact that the problem continues to grow,
however, the danger of antibiotic is still commonly underestimated. As
problematic as current developments may be, they are "only the tip of
the iceberg" (Davies et al. 2013: 36), as [[the dangers of
**a**]{.mark}nti**[b]{.mark}**iotic **[r]{.mark}**esistance [that lie
ahead are **even bigger**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The way we try to
counteract, reduce, or prevent already existing antibiotic resistance
today has enormous impacts both on current use of antibiotics but also
on the future. This is the case for those alive today as well as the
generations yet to be born. This is because antibiotic resistance and
its effects are somewhat comparable "to a slow-motion car crash: sadly,
it is one that has already started" (O'Neill 2016: 71) and that cannot
be prevented anymore. In particular, this is due to the irreversible
failures and omissions that have occurred to date. Historical and
current overuse, misuse, and abuse of antibiotics, as well as negligence
of investment, research, and development of new antibiotics or adequate
alternatives have put future generations at risk of losing effective
means to treat bacterial infections.

On its current path, humanity is heading for a future escalation of the
problems described, which will not only lead to poorer health care and
an increase in the number of deaths, but also to severe economic
consequences, as "\[t\]he impact of AMR on economic growth will result
in a pronounced increase in extreme poverty." (World Bank 2017: 22) One
of the commonly cited prognoses "estimate\[s\] that by 2050, 10 million
lives a year and a cumulative 100 trillion USD of economic output are at
risk due to the rise of drug-resistant infections" (O'Neill 2016: 4 and
12). This very prominent projection must be taken with caution,
especially because of its rather speculative nature due to the opaque
methodology (Kraker et al. 2016; Foreman et al. 2018: 2085; O'Neill
2014). However, it cannot be dismissed entirely. One may reasonably
disagree about the extent of the problem, but its current trajectory is
crystal clear: Humanity is not putting enough effort into addressing the
problem of antibiotic resistance and averting the scenario of a
post-antibiotic era (Engström 2021: 21). Since our current handling of
antibiotics and antibiotic resistance have a very significant impact on
the future, this becomes not only a long-term issue, but also a question
of intergenerational justice. For as medically and morally defensible as
some of our current antibiotic use may be, it (re)imposes the extreme
vulnerability to bacterial infections that has plagued humanity for most
of its existence on future generations. The danger is imminent, because
„[[if we allow resistance to **increase**]{.mark}, in a few decades
[we]{.mark} may [start dying from the most **commonplace**]{.mark} of
[ailments]{.mark} that can today be treated easily]{.underline}."

Conclusion: The (un)avoidable era of deadly bacteria upon us?

Overall, [[it is **not impossible** to avert the]{.mark} grim
**[post-antibiotic era]{.mark}**]{.underline} in which millions of
people die each year from untreatable bacterial infections that
scientists and organisations like the World Health Organization keep
warning the global community about. Therefore, [[Combating
**A**]{.mark}nti**[m]{.mark}**icrobial
**[R]{.mark}**esistance]{.underline} and Protecting the Miracle of
Modern Medicine (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine 2022) [is not a lost cause. At present,]{.underline} however,
success is unlikely, and realistically, [the **[goal]{.mark}** of the
initiatives taken [can only be to **reduce** or]{.mark} at least [**slow
down** the problem]{.mark}s at hand]{.underline}, not to completely
avert the dangers outlined. Given the problem's current scope, [[it
is]{.mark} not [a question]{.mark}]{.underline} of whether antibiotic
resistance is going to hit humanity, but only [[of **how hard** it will
hit it and **how much** of an existential threat this
poses]{.underline}]{.mark}. The past omissions in areas such as research
and development, as well as the widespread failure to use antibiotics
rationally, demonstrate a lack of political and societal commitment to a
serious change in the way antibiotics are used. Furthermore, attempting
to stop antibiotic resistance does come at a price -- the most pressing
one being the potential exposure of current patients to health risks in
order to spare future ones.

We use ALAN as indicator of [**human activity** in [the terrestrial
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but data uncertainties require
cautiousness. Snow albedo effects might enhance artificial light
effects, but that means it also should be included as part of the light
pollution of human activity. There can be an overestimation of lit area
from satellites compared to actual lit area on the ground mainly due to
large pixel size and geolocation errors (34) or residuals in the
corrected dataset sourced by auroras and blooming effects, yet also a
significant underestimation of the area in underdeveloped regions (35).
However, while the total lit area might overestimate the direct impact
by infrastructure, it is a reliable indicator of both hotspots of
current human activity in the Arctic and of development over time.
[Accordingly, we use the area of ALAN as an indicator of the total area
[impacted by human activities and its]{.mark} spatial
[distribution]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [the [presence of **roads

Researchers have only begun to understand the impacts of biogeochemical
hazards remobilized from thawing permafrost. What is clear is that
[established transport pathways could **rapidly disperse hazardous
compounds** through atmospheric, hydrologic and terrestrial systems
after emergence]{.underline}151--153. [When materials move through
**adjacent environments**, they are subject to biotic and abiotic
**transformation**, creating secondary and tertiary impacts throughout
the Arctic system]{.underline}52,153,154 (Fig. 1). [**[Permafrost
carbon]{.mark}** may further [serve as a **nutrient source and vector**,
increasing the **range** of]{.mark} pollutants and [microorganisms **as
thaw increases**]{.mark}]{.underline}7,53. [As the cryosphere collapses
under climate change, [higher temperatures]{.mark} **alter dispersion
pathways**, **[heighten transport]{.mark}**, accelerate chemical
degradation [and **increase bioaccumulation**]{.mark} of hazardous
materials]{.underline}34,155,156. As such, international efforts to
reduce the release of anthropogenic chemicals into the environment must
account for secondary remobilization from degrading systems116,157,158.

Quantifying the risks to rapidly changing Arctic ecosystems from
entrained permafrost biochemical compounds is an ongoing challenge9 .
[The dominant Arctic transport mechanisms of atmospheric
remobilization]{.underline}159,160, [hydrological
transport]{.underline}83,161,162, [direct transport (through human or
animal migration)]{.underline}110,163 [and trophic-level flow all need
to be assessed for **dispersion potential**]{.underline}86,88,111. The
transport rates and efficiency differ tremendously between these
mechanisms, releasing sequestered compounds into recently thawed
ecosystems160,164,165.

Hydrologic and atmospheric transport. [Permafrost [thaw opens
new]{.mark} hydrologic transport [pathways, **increasing connectivity**
and providing **more efficient delivery** for]{.mark} chemicals and
**[microorganisms]{.mark}**]{.underline}49 (Fig. 1). Freshwater lakes
and ponds currently cover \~16% of the Arctic landscape166, but [thaw
and glacier melt further [activates **groundwater pathways**, linking
**lakes, rivers and the coastal ocean**]{.mark}]{.underline}167,168.
[Carbon]{.underline}9 , [mercury]{.underline}105,
[microorganisms]{.underline}169, [legacy pollutants]{.underline}39,77
[and any soluble materials can then **flow between ecosystem**
compartments, **[increasing]{.mark} potential [interaction]{.mark}**.
Microbial genes also move in meltwater between ecosystems]{.underline}.
For example, a recent study of pelagic Chloroflexi (a diverse phylum of
aerobic microorganisms) within the Arctic Ocean identified a lateral
transfer of genes that were previously found only in terrestrial
genomes169. These terrestrial genes markedly increase aquatic
Chloroflexi's efficiency in metabolizing terrestrial carbon, a new
adaptation for the Arctic Ocean species169.

[As the Arctic warms and permafrost [thaw]{.mark}s, atmospheric dynamics
will continue to fluctuate, [transfer]{.mark}ring]{.underline} volatile
chemicals and [particulated [microorganisms into **near-surface
air**]{.mark}]{.underline}155,170--172. It is unclear whether this flux
will increase the number of ice nucleating particles from the soil,
changing the density, range and precipitation from Arctic clouds172,173
(Fig. 1). [Changes in albedo and circulation patterns will continue to
drive fluctuations in Arctic atmospheric conditions]{.underline}, but
lesser-understood drivers such as ice nucleating particles may have a
growing role.

interest]{.mark}** in the economic potential of the Arctic as mineral
resources, maritime navigation and tourism all become more accessible.
This [poses **microbial risks**]{.mark}]{.underline} and opportunities
\[117\].

Firstly, [growing [**commercial and political interests** coupled
with]{.mark} increased [**logistical accessibility** is likely to
stimulate interest in Arctic **bioprospecting**]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[23\]. [[Adaptations]{.mark} for life in the cold [found within
the]{.mark} reservoir of [Arctic]{.mark} genomic diversity [can be
**industrially useful**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[118\]. Examples include
enzymes with low temperature optima \[119\], low-alcohol yeast \[120\],
antifreeze and ice-binding proteins \[121\], and potential
antimicrobials \[122\] (Table 1, fully referenced and expanded in Table
S1, available with the online version of this article). [[To date, the
majority of antimicrobial compounds]{.mark} and cold-active enzymes
[have relied on **cultured isolates**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which are
either screened directly for activity \[122\] or genome sequenced;
followed by the cloning and expression of candidate genes or gene
clusters in a heterologous host \[123\]. [These strategies rely on the
isolation and genome-sequencing of microbes, [which is
**limiting**]{.mark}]{.underline} because: (i) fully sequenced genomes
of Arctic strains are limited in number (see below), and (ii) many
microbes remain uncultivated. In addition, advances in sequence-based
and functional metagenomic approaches \[124\] offer promising approaches
to mine and exploit such potential. For example, specially engineered
heterologous expression hosts, such as the ArcticExpress Escherichia
coli competent cells (Agilent Technologies) and Pseudoalteromonas
haloplanktis TAC125 strain \[123\] are noteworthy for being products of
cryospheric bioprospecting, and tools by which further functional
exploration of this environment can be accomplished. ArcticExpress cells
co-express the chaperonin system Cpn60 and Cpn10 from Oleispira
antarctica , which helps to ensure the proper folding of cold-active
proteins and increase the growth rate of E. coli at low temperatures
\[125\]. Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125, however, is of
cryospheric origin, and displays increased solubility and secretion of
protein products over other Gram-negative expression hosts. [[Meanwhile,
improvements in **sequencing technologies** have resulted in the
assembly of longer contigs]{.mark}, with deeper coverage [than **ever
before**]{.mark}, unlocking types of analyses previously available only
to whole-genome-sequenced cultured organisms]{.underline}. Tools such as
antiSMASH \[126\], for example, can be used on metagenomic datasets
(contigs or MAGs) to detect biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for
the synthesis of industrially useful compounds, such as antibiotics,
fatty acids, polysaccharides, antioxidants and UV-protective pigments.
However, [the greatest improvements in bioprospecting will likely come
from the synergy of sequence-based and functional methods, because an
understanding of the genomic background of the **source
organism**]{.underline} (see below) [is vital for the strategic
**genetic engineering of suitable hosts** and the identification of
optimal conditions for expression of the desired natural
product]{.underline}.

\[table 1 removed\]

Secondly, the Arctic is not pristine and has not been pristine for some
time \[127\]. There is a long history of human activities that have
contaminated the Arctic in many ways, from hydrocarbon exploitation
\[128, 129\] to military activities, including the largest nuclear
explosion to date \[130\]. These have resulted in locally derived
contamination of the Arctic. Likewise, long-range atmospheric transport
of pollutants and the global distillation effect has led to the
deposition of pollutants in the Arctic from the mid-latitudes for at
least 3 millennia \[127\]. The potential roles of microbes in modulating
or exacerbating the threats posed by contaminants liberated by Arctic
warming is a current focus for researchers addressing radionuclide
\[131\], persistent organic pollutant \[132\], black carbon \[133\],
mercury \[134\] and heavy metal contaminants \[135\]. Furthermore, both
[increased access to the Arctic and [the potential release of
**long-frozen**]{.mark} **hazards** is raising the prospect of the
liberation of **[ancient infectious diseases]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[136, 137\]. Such notions seem speculative, for they depend on the
release of viable agents able to withstand severe freeze--thaw stresses
as they migrate to the actively melting layers of glaciers or permafrost
\[138\]. Hitherto, dedicated efforts to recover pathogens from the
Arctic have failed, as human remains have degraded within the active
layer of permafrost \[139\]. However, the release of Bacillus anthracis
from frozen wildlife carcasses has been invoked as the cause of a recent
Siberian anthrax outbreak \[140\]. A further hypothetical [[risk is
presented by implementing **synthetic biology** approaches to
resurrect]{.mark} poorly described [viral **genomes from Arctic
ice**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[141\], [as these may [generate **highly
concentrated infectious materials within
laboratories**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[137\]. The ethical debate and
moratorium on resurrecting highly pathogenic influenza strains \[142\]
offers a certain precedent for concern within this arena.

#### Safety [doesn't]{.underline} [matter]{.underline}\-\--the [risk]{.underline} is enough to [reject]{.underline} the [possibility]{.underline}.

Warming events in the Arctic have increased in frequency in the past few
years45,46, and regional temperature anomalies of up to +40 °C during
the deep cold season overlay some of [[the largest areas of
**carbon-rich permafrost**]{.underline}]{.mark} (\>100 kg m−2)47.
Measurements from the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost suggest
that, between 2007 and 2016, continuous permafrost in the top 3m
[[throughout the Arctic warm]{.mark}ed **[0.39]{.mark}**±0.15**[°C on
average]{.mark}**]{.underline}48 (Fig. 1b), raising concerns about the
rapid rate of thaw and potential old carbon release5,49--55. Where
peatlands and permafrost overlap, [deeply buried carbon within is
increasingly at risk from **warming**]{.underline}, and a substantial
loss of Yedoma could potentially result in a 50% increase in the PCF by
2100 (refs35,40,55). Additionally, [[while]{.mark} peatlands
[**currently** function as a **carbon sink**]{.mark}]{.underline},
continued [[warming could thaw]{.mark} an estimated 0.8 to [**1.9

**permafrost [carbon release]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} up to
**[50%]{.mark}**]{.underline}56.

Incorporating contemporary warming, model simulations predict a total
loss of near-surface permafrost (0--3m) ranging from 0.2 to 58.8×103km2
per year7 . This estimate reflects a loss of 3--5 million km2 permafrost
in the RCP4.5 scenario and 6--16 million km2 for RCP8.5 by 2100
(ref.57). Subsequently, vulnerable permafrost in the top 3m is expected
to discharge 0.62PgCO2 per year (624 million tons) by 2100 through

[The majority of Arctic permafrost has been present since the
**Pleistocene** (800 kyr to 1Myr ago) or the **Last Glacial Maximum**
(\~10 kyr ago; ka)]{.underline}6 . Permafrost depth is a first-order
approximation of age, where deeper layers were deposited further in the
past. [However, **permafrost thaw** changes this structure, **opening
new niches**, closing old ones, **resuscitating dormant microbial
communities** and **enabling transport** into the surrounding
environment]{.underline}7,8 . [[Gradual thaw releases the most recently
sequestered components first]{.mark}, followed by increasingly older
constituents as thaw penetrates deeper]{.underline}9,10. This top-down
thaw is driven by temperature and precipitation changes and is
relatively slow, typically increasing active layer depth at rates of
centimetres per decade9 . [[By contrast, **abrupt thaw rapidly exposes

[microorganisms sequestered in **deeper

Previous reviews summarized Arctic system research, focusing on
important topics such as the permafrost carbon feedback and abrupt

Thermokarst thaw lakes61 now cover 1.095 million km2 , representing an
estimated release of 14--18TgC per year62. Additionally, talik expansion

Permafrost distribution and carbon stocks. [[Permafrost]{.mark}

permafrost is [in the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}31, 1.06 million

[[**Where** black carbon is released]{.mark} also [**matters**.
Particulates emitted]{.mark} from wood-burning stoves [in places like
South Asia can affect the Arctic, but those **emitted locally** have a
**larger impact**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This is why the actions of Russia, whose northern regions account for
two-thirds of Arctic economic activity despite accounting for only half
of the region's landmass, can alter the fate of the entire circumpolar
North. The country's efforts to reduce gas flaring and emissions from
transportation in recent years have been shown to reduce radiative
forcing, or the amount of energy entering the atmosphere. At the same
time, Russia will continue to burn heavy fuel oil (HFO) in the Arctic
until 2029---the last possible moment under International Maritime
Organization (IMO) regulations. The IMO recently voted to ban HFO in the
Arctic to reduce black carbon levels, with voluntary restrictions
beginning in 2024 and mandatory ones in 2029. The five-year "grace
period" was included partly as a concession to Russia, which had opposed
the restrictions altogether. (Canada, too, does not plan to immediately
implement the HFO ban in 2024.)

Another LAP of note is algae. [As warmer spring and summer temperatures
hasten **melting** on the Arctic's snow and ice surfaces, **algae** that
lay dormant in the ice during winter venture up to the surface, where
they **bloom** in grimy green, pink, and gray. Exposure to sunlight
**darkens** the algae, [which **accelerates melting** of the ice]{.mark}
beneath.]{.underline} Climate change is also increasing wind speeds,
leading to greater transport of phosphorus, a naturally occurring
ingredient used in fertilizer. This trend is feeding the annual algal
blooms as well. One portion of the Greenland ice sheet has become so
covered in algae that scientists refer to it as "the dark zone," a
phenomenon that has increased in size and duration over the past two
decades.

is [pretty **tiny in the grand scheme**]{.mark} of things, we get pretty

to space]{.mark}, [you]{.mark} have to [burn stuff]{.mark}. But it's
burned [at such **high pressures and temperatures** that the combustion

can't do anything in space without some kind of emissions, and so you
have to make those trades. Fortunately, with space travel, usually the
missions that you're doing and the services that you're providing
outweigh the cost significantly. I tend to think that putting stuff in
space is like building infrastructure. If we put a satellite into orbit
to do weather prediction, for example, that small machine provides
weather details and data to literally millions of people around the
planet. So you can have a really big impact for a relatively small piece
of infrastructure. Whereas if you build a road in a city, it's only the
people who live in that area and have access to it who benefit.

Infectious disease has been a contributing factor in 3.7% of species
extinctions known to have occurred between the years 1,500 and 2008
(Smith et al., 2009). In humans, the 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak
killed 1--5% of world population (Johnson and Mueller, 2002,
Spreeuwenberger et al. 2018).6 Koch et al. (2019) estimate that
epidemics killed 90% of the indigenous population of the Americas as the
result of diseases carried over by European colonists in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries.

[[It is]{.mark} considered [**very unlikely** that a **naturally
occurring pandemic**]{.mark}7 [would be a primary cause of]{.mark} human
**[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Ord, 2020), [and the author is
aware [of **no credible work** present]{.mark}ing [**plausible
pathways**. Such a disease would need **both** to spread to]{.mark}
nearly **[all humans]{.mark}** across the world [**and** be of
**extremely high lethality** or cause **infertility** at extremely high
rates]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, it seems plausible that pandemic
disease could play a contributing role in combination with other factors
in an extinction scenario.

A common concern is that advances in the biological sciences and
biotechnology could enable the creation of more dangerous viruses and
other forms of biological agent than exist in nature (Millett and
Snyder-Beattie, 2017). Biological weapon development and use are
prohibited under the Biological Weapons Convention; however, leading
states have developed major biological weapons programmes in the past,
and it is conceivable that such directions might be pursued in future or
are presently being pursued clandestinely (Riedel, 2004). Further,
advances in these sciences lower the barrier to entry to the development
of dangerous agents in terms of cost, expertise and equipment needed,
potentially bringing globally catastrophic capabilities within the reach
of small groups in future. While groups willing to bring about global
catastrophe or even extinction would be expected to be rare, there have
been notable examples of groups motivated by near-apocalyptic ideology
such as the Aum Shinrikyo cult,8 which attempted to weaponise Anthrax
and carried out successful local nerve agent attacks (Lifton, 1999;
Torres, 2016). Gopal et al. (2023) outline two scenarios leading to
civilisational collapse: a "wildfire" scenario in which one or more
pandemic agents leads to disruption of food, water, power supply and law
enforcement and a "stealth" scenario in which an initially asymptomatic
agent with long incubation time is spread to a majority of humanity.
They consider both scenarios most likely to involve accidental or
deliberate release of human-modified agents. Direct targeting of humans
is only one plausible pathway to global harm; Monica Schoch-Spana et al.
(2017) note the potential pathogens targeting widespread eradication of
food sources; and other forms of environmental harm are plausible.

Here we delve into features of [[permafrost]{.mark} that could make it a
reservoir for microbes, including [pathogens]{.mark}, and discuss what
is known about the potential for microbial pathogens to **emerge** in a
warming climate as permafrost thaws. In most cases, we find that the
**[threat]{.mark}s [to public health are minor]{.mark}**. We show that,
although there is potential for bacterial human pathogens, such as
Bacillus anthracis causing anthrax, to be problematic as permafrost
thaws, there is **less potential** for other human
pathogens]{.underline}. [[Most of the microorganisms and viruses]{.mark}
that have been [identified in permafrost]{.mark} to date [target
**non-human hosts**]{.mark}, such as plants and
microorganisms]{.underline}. Plant pathogens could, however, pose a risk
to native and introduced crops. [Although fragments of human viruses
have been recovered from remains preserved by permafrost, **[none have
been shown to be infectious to humans]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However,
many of the microorganisms and viruses residing in permafrost have not
yet been isolated or characterized. Therefore, their potential to pose
future risks to humans, animals, and plants warrants consideration.
These risks may increase with climate change as the landscape and
vegetation changes and the human population becomes increasingly exposed
to thawed permafrost lands.

A central question for risk assessment is whether intact viruses survive
decades to millennia entrained in permafrost. [[Attempts]{.mark},
however, [to isolate infectious]{.mark} smallpox and 1918 flu
[viruses]{.mark} and to recover long nucleic acid fragments (as a proxy
for intact virus) [have **failed**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[92, 93\],
[[suggesting that **survival** of]{.mark} these [human-infectious
viruses]{.mark} may be [**limited in permafrost** and]{.mark} that
[**concerns** about their release]{.mark} to a susceptible and
vulnerable populace may **[not]{.mark} be as
[warranted]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Survival of viruses that infect non-human hosts is also important for
wildlife managers. [[Most viruses identified in cold soils]{.mark}
infect bacterial hosts and **[do not pose a direct risk to human
health]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[94, 95\], so those targeting non-human
eukaryotic hosts are a more appropriate proxy. The most well-known
example is the revival of "giant" viruses from ancient permafrost that
infect Acanthamoeba (widespread amoebae) \[85, 96\]. In contrast to
viruses such as the 1918 Flu virus, these viruses may be better adapted
to harsh environments due to the formation of rugged stable capsids
\[97\] and for their hosts to form robust cysts, resulting in resistance
to extremes in temperature and pH \[98, 99\]. Cysts formed during
infection can act as a reservoir, protecting the virus and enabling
reemergence under favorable conditions.

[[For permafrost viruses to infect humans]{.mark} or for a
humaninfectious virus to remain intact even during thaw before
encountering a susceptible host, [it must undergo a **host
shift**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the possibility of these events
cannot be entirely disregarded, [the [risk]{.mark}s [of such occurrences
are]{.mark} likely **[low]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The evolutionary
distance between microeukaryotes and humans is a substantial barrier to
host-shifting as successful host-shifting decreases as the phylogenetic
distance between hosts increases \[100\]. Similar to the giant
Acanthamoeba-infecting viruses, microeukaryotes in cold soils and their
viruses have co-evolved in harsh conditions through geologic time
\[101\], explaining why they survive in permafrost. Viruses with human
hosts do not have this evolutionary history. They lack cold adaptations
and a host that facilitates persistence.

Many microbes such as Bacillus anthracis form spores and can persist for
long periods of time in inhospitable environments including permafrost.
The best-described outbreak was in 2016 in Siberia. It killed thousands
of reindeer, sickened dozens of humans, and killed one \[102\]. However,
[it is likely that **[permafrost thaw alone is not enough to cause
disease]{.mark}**, and that [multiple factors have to act
synergistically for a disease outbreak to occur. **Environmental
conditions**]{.mark} have to be conducive for the pathogen to survive
and human behavior [including **reduced animal and human vaccination**
and an **increase of herd size**]{.mark} may be [**key** to facilitating
disease **spread**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[102\].
