## Notes & Strategy

To lab leaders: Have we talked about reading Impact D against Aff
impacts that also take out Negative position impacts? The benefits,
strategy, when you should and shouldn't, etc., might be necessary here
since 85% of case is war with Russia / China which has a ton of overlap
with Negative positions that link.

Negative positions with unique impacts (not US-Russia war, not climate,
not Arctic-based conflict) might be the goal against this Aff since
there are so many good turn opportunities. For example, Consult AC might
be a good 2NR choice, if possible, due to it 1. Solving case, 2.
Avoiding Russia tension turns due to the consultation mech, and 3.
Having a unique internal impact that the Aff can't access.

### Adv 1 \[Miscalc\] Strategy

#### SUBS TURN

-Russia doesn't like the subs stuff, could escalate to war with the US.
Could use this Komin '25 card as a replacement link card for Russia DA;
could also be read on case as a case turn. Note: Russia DA internal link
is Russia protecting second strike capabilities, which this Komin '25
card mentions specifically as why subs are escalatory.

#### DRONES TURN

-Drones are used in the squo & they're escalatory. Current use and
increase under the plan is bad. That's another link to the Russia DA
(either on case or in the 2NC). Ban the Plan solves current and future
use, so the turn is an additional external net benefit to Ban the Plan
CP.

### Adv 2 \[Env\] Strategy

#### HOTHOUSE EARTH

Read Impact D against Hothouse Earth\-\--the Thorstad '23 card indicts
Steffen, et al., who is the original Hothouse Earth author that
1AC-Torres is citing. If you ctrl+F "Steffen" you'll find the citation
in the 1AC-Torres evidence.

#### RARE EARTHS TURN

-Drilling for Rare Earth mines is a link to the Methuselah DA & Arctic
Thaw DA. DA of choice could be read with the Mining/Drilling link.

-Indo-Pacific Tradeoff DA (within Ban the Plan CP) turns the Rare Earths
scenario; it's in 2NC\-\--!\-\--T/C\-\--Rare Earths.

### Adv 3 \[Shipping\] Strategy

#### ECON SCENARIO

-Indo-Pacific Tradeoff DA (within Ban the Plan CP) turns the Econ
scenario; it's in 2NC\-\--!\-\--T/C\-\--Econ.

#### WAR SCENARIO

A lot of the 1NC defense against Miscalc works here too

## Cross Examination

### 1A-CX

#### -\[Russia Rare Earths / Melting Ice\] Handy & Foggo '24 card says Russia is taking advantage of the melting ice because they own 50% of the coastline -- when you say we need to combat that, are you suggesting we start drilling for rare earths in their territory?

Abstract

[Over 100 countries now have a military **drone** programme comprised of
either armed or unarmed systems]{.underline}. These drones are used to
project power, fulfil national security objectives and signal political
interest in disputed regions. As the climate crisis transforms parts of
the Arctic, considerable investment is taking place in remote systems
that can both monitor for 'unwanted guests' and engage in military
activity. In this context, drones, specifically [unarmed [military
drones]{.mark}, [are becoming the **favoured tech**]{.mark}nology [of
**Arctic states**]{.mark}. Denmark, Iceland, Canada, Russia and the
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates** are all [now using
drones]{.mark}]{.underline} to protect national interests, symbolise
sovereignty and enable a watchful eye to be cast on neighbours and
newcomers, such as China. This article argues that while [the
introduction of military drones may be seen as stabilising in the first
instance, [in the **long**]{.mark}**er [term]{.mark}** [these systems
are likely to **escalate tensions**]{.mark}, [leading to a new]{.mark}
**drone-based [security dilemma]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of particular
note is the 'virtual' net of detection being built by Russia. This net
is reliant on drones, in partnership with additional military
infrastructure and hardware, and has been developed by Moscow to
establish a military capacity to detect and respond to external actors
across and perhaps beyond the Russian Arctic.

1 INTRODUCTION

We see the Russian military building up and having more activities in
the Arctic. That\'s why it\'s important to have more capabilities in the
Arctic. It\'s not about escalating conflicts. This is about the risk we
see in the future if we don\'t have the capabilities, if we don\'t see
what is happening. (Bramsen, 2021)

This article analyses the Russian and Western procurement and deployment
of unarmed military drones in the Arctic and High North. At a time when
economic interests in the melting Arctic are increasing, trade routes
opening and tensions between Russia and the West heightened, military
drones have become a useful way for states to demarcate spheres of
interest and project power. For instance, military drones, especially
unarmed systems, are part of a future strengthening of Danish Armed
forces in the Arctic. This, it had been argued by Trine Bramsen (when
serving as Danish Defence Minister), is necessary to ensure stability
and security in the region. Stability, according to Bramsen (2021),
rests on the capacity to gather information on rivals, provide greater
transparency and, therefore, ensure fewer misunderstandings and
miscalculations. Hence drones are presented by the Danish government as
stabilising technologies. The key question is whether it is possible to
increase levels of military deployment without escalating tensions? This
article argues that although unarmed military drones may be stabilising
in the short term, the escalatory potential of drone deployments, across
regions of the Arctic, demonstrate that any optimism should be tempered
by the possibility of unintended consequences (Rogers, 2021a).

Depledge (2020) argued that the increased number of Western military
exercises in and around the Arctic since 2006 'weakens claims that
cooperation is the dominant trend and reinforces scholarly analyses that
paint a complex picture of the regional security environment where
conflict and cooperation go hand in hand'. Depledge made the case that
the increased number of military exercises has illustrated how 'Western
states (including both Arctic and non-Arctic countries) are keen to
demonstrate that they have the capabilities, competence and resolve to
project force in the northern high latitudes to deter potential
adversaries'. This article uses examples of increasing state unarmed
military drone use in the Arctic and High North to reinforce the idea
that states tread a line of trust and mistrust, conflict and
cooperation, within the world\'s most northernly expanse. Increasing
tensions in the Arctic provide a landscape in which to explore how drone
proliferation fits into this contested context (Rogers, 2021a).

[This article explains where the 'strategic chokepoints' lie and where
'remilitarisation' and drone deployments have occurred. Specifically,
Russian military activity around the **Northern Sea Route (NSR)** is
focused on, with an emphasis on a 'virtual net' of military
infrastructure. An analysis of the [**growing use** of military
drones]{.mark} by Iceland, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the
United States, as the most prominent drone actors, illustrates the
[potentially **escalatory**]{.mark} **consequences of drone
proliferation**]{.underline}.1

[[The new US military strategy in the Arctic
considers]{.underline}]{.mark} the policies of the
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n Federation [[and China
as]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[destabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark} factor in
the region [[and leaves no space for cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}
with them, [[which may lead to an escalation of
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region in the medium term. The US
has gained a significant geopolitical advantage due to its guaranteed
military presence in Finland and Sweden. At the same time, [[the
strategy does not contain a clear statement of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} that come from the Russian Federation and
China. The [[plans for]{.underline}]{.mark} a very specific [[build-up
of infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark} and the US/NATO military presence
in the Arctic [[are a response to **imaginary**
threats]{.underline}]{.mark} that could only hypothetically arise
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n
Federation [[and China. Apparently, there is still no consensus within
the US Department of Defense and the expert and analytical community on
the content of the US military policy in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is largely [[due to the reluctance to
get involved in a military escalation with Russia and the understanding
that the US has insufficient resources for a more offensive policy in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Soviet experience with Svalbard was a further instance of territorial
success, albeit indirect and accidental. At first, the Kremlin outwardly
opposed the 1920 Svalbard treaty because of Soviet exclusion from the
Paris peace negotiations. But [[after insisting on Norwegian recognition
of the Soviet government as a price for Soviet ratification, Soviet
authorities gradually came to appreciate the treaty's
value]{.underline}]{.mark}. Article 9 of the treaty called upon parties
to ensure that no naval bases or fortification are established on the
islands 'which may never be sued for warlike purposes'.25 [[The
**demilitarized** status of the islands]{.underline}]{.mark}, located
essentially at the door of Russia's Arctic sector, [[clearly was to
Russia's **advantage**. The treaty **eliminated** the islands from
future **competition** and from Russia's perspective a staging base to
threaten its Arctic flank during the Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}.
While these security ramifications may not have been fully appreciated
at the time of adoption, they likely demonstrated again to Moscow that
sovereignty issues over soil, and later over sub-soil areas, can be
resolved through international treaties to Russia's advantage.26

(ermo-MSDI, acc 7-2-2025)

Svalbard Archipelago

[[Norway and Russia have]{.underline}]{.mark} a long history of
competing claims over the Svalbard Archipelago (see Figure 3). In 1920,
the countries [[signed the Svalbard Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}. It made
Svalbard part of the Kingdom of Norway, but Norway must not 'allow the
establishment of any naval bases ... and not construct any fortification
in the said territories, which may never be used for warlike
purposes.'14 Additionally, the treaty did little to clarify the
administration of the surrounding waters and the resources contained
therein. Major M. N. Behrens, Royal Danish Air Force, in his 2014 award
winning research paper from USAF Air Command and Staff College,
presented this issue well when he stated 'a failing and assertive Russia
could choose to seize the Svalbard archipelago militarily, to claim the
territory and adjacent waters directly or to improve their position in
post-conflict settlement of the status of Svalbard and adjacent
waters.'15

[[If Russia were to seek to control Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark}
through military intervention, it would qualify as an Article 5
violation and require NATO to defend the territory of Norway. While [[it
would **not** be in the interest of **either side** to **escalate**
hostilities]{.underline}]{.mark} outside the immediate Svalbard region,
spill over into other theatres could be possible. [[Since this would be
a limited conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} and neither deterrence nor
de-escalation would be the main aim, it is likely [[both sides would be
motivated to stay **well below** any **nuclear**
threshold]{.underline}]{.mark}, but that does not preclude armed combat.

*The process of accidental war*

[[There is a]{.underline} **[divide]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline}]{.mark} the process of [[accidental war]{.mark}
assumed [in]{.mark}]{.underline} game-theoretic
[**[models]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
process]{.underline} of accidental war as [discussed in]{.underline}
much of the **[[lit]{.mark}erature]{.underline}** on crisis management.
The game-theoretic mechanism of a move by Nature that takes you to war
is the core of this distinction between the two. It means that war does
not result from decisions to go to war, it results from chance, as
represented in Figure 3. [The]{.underline} **[[central]{.mark}
element]{.underline}** [[is that something]{.underline}
**[inadvertent]{.underline}**]{.mark}---an accident, mistaken warning,
or some unauthorized action---[happens]{.underline}, [which [results
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[war]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [This
happens]{.underline} [**[purely]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}
**[chance]{.underline}**, **[without]{.underline}**]{.mark} any
**[[choice]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on the part of decision
makers]{.underline}. Leaders might have chosen to take escalatory steps
that increased the likelihood that events spiraled out of control, such
as in Powell's (1990) model of brinkmanship, but this could only occur
before the accident because an actual decision to go to war is
irrational. **[[No war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has [occurred in this
manner]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [so]{.underline}]{.mark} [there
are]{.underline} **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}** empirical
**[[cases]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that [correspond]{.mark} to this
model]{.underline}.

[This stands [in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[stark contrast]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the process]{.underline} of accidental war
usually [laid out in [discussions]{.mark}]{.underline} of crisis
management, as illustrated in Figure 4. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
process **[[adds]{.underline}]{.mark}** [a step between the]{.underline}
inadvertent [event and war]{.underline}: [[the]{.underline} **[leader's
choice]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to go to war]{.underline}. For example,
in each of the three American Indian Wars that he identifies as
accidental, Szarejko (2021) describes how leaders chose to fight
following some inadvertent action. Similarly, concerns about launch on
warning nuclear command and control systems are centered on the idea
that false warnings might lead to a decision to launch a nuclear strike
against the enemy, which in turn would lead to war. Unlike the model
outlined in Figure 3, a few wars have occurred following the dynamics
highlighted in Figure 4. Probably the best example is the
Spanish--American War, with the explosion of the USS *Maine* providing
the accidental trigger to the crisis that resulted in the decisions by
the United States and Spain to go to war.

\[FIGURE EXCLUDED\]

[The fact that war results]{.underline} here [from leaders' choices
would]{.underline} seem to [indicate that]{.underline}
[**[no]{.underline}** [war is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[truly
[accidental]{.mark}]{.underline}** or inadvertent, even from accidental
war advocates' own perspective. After all, if war results from choices,
not from chance, then it isn't accidental or inadvertent, as discussed
earlier. Further, **[[mistaken warning]{.underline}]{.mark}** [seems to
be at the]{.underline} **[core]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} many
[concerns]{.underline} about accidental nuclear war (Blair, 1993, 1994;
Feaver, 1992, 1994; Sagan, 1993, 1994; Thayer, 1994), [but
this]{.underline} really [[seems to be]{.mark} an argument
[about]{.mark}]{.underline} the danger created by **[[incomplete
info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}**. For example, [Utgoff]{.underline}
(1985: 126) [suggests]{.underline} on-site **[monitoring]{.underline}**
[as a way]{.underline} "[for]{.underline} **[reducing]{.underline}**
[the probability]{.underline} of accidental nuclear war."
[[The]{.underline} **[only way]{.underline}** [for monitoring to
affect]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[likelihood]{.underline}]{.mark} of war
[[is]{.mark} through [making]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} available to decision makers **[more
[complete]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Info]{.mark}rmation revelation [can
affect the likelihood]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[choose]{.mark} to go to

[**[chance]{.underline}**]{.mark} rather than choice.

[[Incomplete info]{.mark}rmation [is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[well
known]{.underline}** as a cause of war (Fearon, 1995), [and]{.underline}
it is [**[already]{.underline}** [accounted for]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in]{.underline} game-theoretic models of deterrence, including ones
that feature accidental war as a mechanism (e.g. Powell, 1990) and
[models that]{.underline} **[do not allow]{.underline}** [accidental

information can certainly make the difference between peace and war, a
war that results from deliberate decision-making, even in the face of
uncertainty or incomplete information, is not accidental or inadvertent.
[Thus]{.underline}, [[both]{.underline} **[logic]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[evidence contradict]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
notion of [[accidental war]{.underline}]{.mark}.

However, even if it is universally accepted that accidental or
inadvertent wars have never happened---a very unlikely prospect---that
would not be enough to convince some that they have overstated the risk
of inadvertent nuclear war. For example, Sagan (1993: 263) argues that
"prenuclear history is a very poor guide in this matter. Not only should
one worry more about rare events when nuclear weapons are involved; but
the nuclear weapons arsenals we have created appear to have themselves
increased the likelihood of accidental war."

*Why the focus on accidental war?*

So why do [[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to talk about the
possibility of accidental or inadvertent war even in the face of logic
and evidence against it? Trachtenberg (2000: 23) argues that the crucial
reason is not because these scholars are dishonest or stupid, it is that
"people [**[want]{.underline}** [to believe]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[the military]{.mark}]{.underline} system [[can]{.mark} be
a]{.underline} **[major [cause]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for

renegade military officers, and/or the reciprocal fear of surprise
attack all pose serious threats to the prospects for peace.

2024 Highlights [[Across Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}

Looking across the three [[ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark} this year,
[[there are several notable indicators]{.underline}]{.mark} amidst
continued variability in many marine conditions.

Ocean Temperatures

[[Ocean temperatures in the Bering Sea have cooled to
average]{.underline}]{.mark} thermal conditions. Ocean temperatures in
the Gulf of Alaska were warm in the winter and spring. In the Aleutians,
temperatures cooled but remained warmer than average in winter and
cooled to average for the rest of the year. The exception was in the
western Aleutians, where they have remained warm since mid-late summer.
Bottom temperatures were near average across the chain.

Groundfish

Pacific ocean perch continue to be the dominant groundfish in the
Aleutian Islands, replacing pollock and Atka mackerel in the ecosystem.
The Gulf of Alaska groundfish are now dominated by zooplankton-eating
groundfish (Pacific ocean perch, walleye pollock) over fish and
invertebrate-eating groundfish (arrowtooth flounder, Pacific cod,
Pacific halibut).

Indicators of Ecosystem Health and Potential Threats

[[Harmful algal blooms are becoming more prevalent in the northern
Bering Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}. Harmful algal [[blooms in the Gulf of
Alaska slightly decreased]{.underline}]{.mark} in frequency, intensity,
or duration, but areas continue to have shellfish testing above the
regulatory limit.

Paralytic shellfish toxins in sampled blue mussels from Unalaska in the
Aleutian Islands were seven times above the regulatory limit (compared
to 47 times in 2023).

**Bering Strait species are resilient**

Kristen **Pope**, Oct 18, 20**24** \"Pacific walrus populations
resilient in face of 150 years of overhunting,\" Arctic Focus,
https://www.arcticfocus.org/stories/pacific-walrus-populations-resilient-face-150-years-overhunting/,
(ermo-sms,acc 7-4-2025)

[[Pacific walrus populations resilient in]{.underline}]{.mark} face of
150 years of overhunting

In 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from Russia, and American
hunters wasted no time utilizing their newly-established access to [[the
Bering and Chukchi Seas]{.underline}]{.mark} to hunt marine mammals.

In 20 short years, hunters reduced the Pacific walrus population from
approximately 200,000 animals by at least half. Only 50,000 to 100,000
walruses remained, with the rest hunted for their valuable hides,
blubber, and long ivory tusks.

Pacific walruses are large pinnipeds, with males growing up to 3.6
meteres long and weighing around 1,800 kilograms. Females are smaller,
though that's relative since they can still weigh more than a ton.

Indigenous people who lived in the Bering Strait region at the time
relied on these substantial walruses for subsistence, and the massive
overhunting events left them without the food they needed to survive.
Researchers believe this commercial overharvesting of Pacific walruses
caused a famine that led one-third of the Indigenous people in the
region to starve to death in 1878 and 1879.

Commercial hunting slowed soon after, since there were no longer enough
walruses in the area to make hunting them profitable.

[[After the]{.underline}]{.mark} Pacific walrus [[population
plunged]{.underline}]{.mark} to the point [[where hunting them was not
profitable, the population rebounded]{.underline}]{.mark}---which led to
more hunting, and they were once again overhunted, with a peak in 1920.
Then the cycle repeated again, with hunting slowing enough to allow the
population to rebound, followed by a third wave of overhunting, which
finally slowed around 1960 following the establishment of protections.

It took around 20 years for the population to significantly recover from
this third overhunting event. Today, protections are in place for the
species, and scientists believe the species has largely recovered from
overhunting. However, scientists wanted to see how the genetic diversity
of these animals was affected by three massive population reductions in
a relatively short period of time so they looked to ancient DNA for
clues, recently publishing their findings in Scientific Reports.

"[[We wanted to see how \[the population contractions\] affected their
genetic diversity]{.underline}]{.mark}," says Kendall Mills, an author
on the Scientific Reports article, who recently finished a PhD in
biology at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. "As climate change
continues to degrade their habitat, primarily floating sea ice, we
wanted to see if we could use some information about how they responded
to population contractions in the past to see if we could predict how
they\'re going to respond... once these threats get worse in the
future."

Genetic diversity is the gene variation present in the population of a
species. When animals lose [[genetic diversity]{.underline}]{.mark}, it
[[can lead to an "extinction vortex"]{.underline}]{.mark} when a small
population inbreeds and individuals could potentially suffer more
genetic disorders, which could make the population continue to drop.
Once it reaches a certain threshold, a "ratcheting effect" makes it very
difficult to reverse course, and can lead to extinction.

Researchers wanted to learn if the three overhunting events that
occurred in rapid succession---along with resulting population
contractions---caused a loss of genetic diversity in Pacific walruses.
To study this, they turned to ancient DNA (aDNA). They extracted DNA
from ancient bones that were up to 3,300 years old---dating back well
before the overhunting period---at the University of Alaska Fairbanks\'s
UAM Ancient DNA Lab. Then, they compared the findings from those bones
to modern-day DNA from healthy walruses.

The modern walrus samples were collected from subsistence harvests on
St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, that took place from 2014-2016, and a
variety of samples were taken from 1933 to 2015 from a number of
sources. The ancient samples were obtained from UAM's Archaeology
Collection and UIC Science, LLC in Utqiaġvik, Alaska.

After dating the samples and performing extensive analysis,
[[researchers were surprised]{.underline}]{.mark} to find no significant
difference between the ancient and modern samples. While [[they were
anticipating finding a loss of genetic diversity]{.underline}]{.mark},
the results surprised them.

"[[We weren\'t expecting to discover that the diversity hadn\'t fallen
**at all**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Mills says. "We thought that it would
have fallen a little bit."

### 1NC\-\--BioDiversity Defense

#### Biodiversity loss won't cause extinction

mathematics from Cornell University, director of the Institute of the
Environment and Sustainability at UCLA.Valerie, Ph.D. Candidate at

The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds
other than CO2 could also portend existential risks. Here the answer is
not clear. **[One boundary often mentioned as a concern for the fate of
global civilization is biodiversity]{.underline}** (Ehrlich & Ehrlich,
2012), with the proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than
0.001% per year (Rockström et al., 2009). **[There is little evidence
that this particular 0.001% annual loss is a
threshold]{.underline}**---**[and it is hard to imagine any data that
would allow one to identify where the threshold was]{.underline}**
(Brook, Ellis, Perring, Mackay, & Blomqvist, 2013; Lenton & Williams,
2013). A better question is whether one can imagine any scenario by
which the loss of too many species leads to the collapse of societies
and environmental disasters, even though one cannot know the absolute
number of extinctions that would be required to create this dystopia.

**[While [there are data that relate local reductions in species
richness]{.mark} to altered ecosystem function, [these results do not
point to]{.mark} substantial [existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The **[data are small-scale experiments in which plant productivity, or
nutrient retention is reduced as species numbers decline
locally]{.underline}** (Vellend, 2017), or are local observations of
increased variability in fisheries yield when stock diversity is lost
(Schindler et al., 2010). **[Those are not existential
risks]{.underline}**. **[To make the link even more tenuous, [there is
little ev]{.mark}idence that [biod]{.mark}iversity [is]{.mark} even
[declining at local scales]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Vellend et al., 2013,
Vellend et al., 2017). **[Total [planetary biod]{.mark}iversity [may be
in decline, but local]{.mark} and regional [biod]{.mark}iversity [is
often staying the same because species from elsewhere replace]{.mark}
local [losses]{.mark}]{.underline}**, albeit homogenizing the world in
the process. Although the majority of conservation scientists are likely
to flinch at this conclusion, **[there is growing skepticism regarding
the strength of evidence linking trends in biodiversity loss to an
existential risk for humans]{.underline}** (Maier, 2012; Vellend, 2014).
**[Obviously [if all biod]{.mark}iversity [disappeared civilization
would end]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[but no one is forecasting]{.mark}
the loss of [all species]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It seems plausible that
the loss of 90% of the world's species could also be apocalyptic, but
not one is predicting that degree of biodiversity loss either. Tragic,
but plausible is the possibility of our planet suffering a loss of as
many as half of its species. **[If global biodiversity were halved, but
at the same time locally the number of species stayed relatively stable,
what would be the mechanism for an end-of-civilization or even end of
human prosperity scenario?]{.underline}** **[Extinctions and
[biod]{.mark}iversity [loss are ethical]{.mark} and spiritual
[losses]{.mark}, but perhaps [not an existential
risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

// ***mosuQ***\]

What about the most speculative scenarios? A rather controversial paper
by Will Steffen and colleagues, "Trajectories of the earth system in the
Anthropocene" predicts that once we reach 2°C of warming, the world will
enter a [\`**[Hothouse Earth]{.mark}**']{.underline} phase, in which
even with little additional use of fossil fuels, cumulative warming will
reach 6°C above preindustrial levels.

\[IMAGE REMOVED\]

At the risk of beating a very dead horse, [the first thing to say about
this scenario is that it still **[would not kill us]{.mark}**. We have
reviewed almost every plausible direct mechanism (heat stress, crop
failure, sea level rise, ...) by which warming could lead to existential
catastrophe. And we have seen that none of these mechanisms plausibly
threatens anything like existential catastrophe even under the extreme
assumption of 6°C warming]{.underline}.

More to the point, [\`[Hothouse Earth]{.mark}' [is]{.mark} rather
**[speculative science]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} media coverage has
**[stretched]{.mark}** its **[conclusions]{.mark}** far beyond those
initial speculations. [The **model** itself is **highly
uncertain**]{.mark} and presents options for avoiding
catastrophe]{.underline}. Here is Richard Bettes, Professor of Climate
Impacts at the University of Exeter:

With some exceptions, much of the highest-profile coverage of the essay
presents the scenario as definite and imminent. [The impression is given
that 2°C is a definite "point of no return", and that beyond that the
"hothouse" scenario will rapidly arrive. Many articles ignore the
caveats that the **2°C threshold is extremely uncertain**, and [that
even if]{.mark} it were [correct, the extreme conditions would not occur
for **centuries or millennia**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

And what exactly is the research-backed case behind \`Hothouse Earth'?
Here things get a bit hairy, because as Betts reminds us, [**[Steffen et
al.]{.mark}** (2018) [is]{.mark} an opinion piece, [not a **standalone
research paper**]{.mark}, and as such [it]{.mark} really [doesn't do the
kind of modeling]{.mark} that would be [needed to advance it]{.mark}s
thesis [to the realm of]{.mark} **serious
[credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[One thing that strikes me about the scientific literature on "tipping
points" is that there are a lot of review papers like this that end up
citing the same studies and each other]{.underline} ... There is a great
deal of interesting, insightful research going on using theoretical
methods and calculations with large approximations. However, [we have
yet to see an **equivalent level of research** in the highly-complex
Earth System Models which generate the kind of detailed climate
projections used for addressing policy-relevant questions by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]{.underline}. Steffen
and colleagues have made a good start at addressing such questions,
going as far as they can on the basis of the existing literature, but
their essay should motivate new research to help narrow down the huge
uncertainties. This will help us see better whether "Hothouse Earth" is
our destiny, or mere speculation.

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

At the risk of piling on, Halstead adds another objection to the mix --
[Steffen and colleagues seem to have forgotten to argue for the main
conclusion of their paper: that climate feedbacks could generate six
degrees of warming]{.underline}. Halstead collects together [[all of the
feedback effects mentioned]{.mark} by Steffen and colleagues in the main
text:]{.underline}

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

The problem? [These [add up to a mere **0.47°**]{.mark}**C [of
warming]{.mark}**]{.underline} by 2100! If feedback effects are to take
us from 2°C of 6°C of warming, Steffen and colleagues need to find an
additional 3.53°C of warming after 2100 due to feedback effects.

[Steffen and colleagues certainly claim that this additional warming
will occur. But they are not terribly **precise** about the
**details**]{.underline}. As Halstead puts it: "they do not explain what
might cause the remaining 3.5°C of warming over millennia implied by
their Figure 1".

[This sort of speculative modeling can be a good impetus for future
work, but [it should not be taken as a **scientifically respectable**
ground for **alarmist predictions** of]{.mark} the likelihood of
[impending **existential catastrophe**]{.mark} due to climate change.
[There is simply **not enough evidence**]{.mark} to ground such
predictions]{.underline}.

**[Just over [250 million years ago]{.mark}, [the planet

~~holocaust~~ \[mass death\]: ninety-six percent of marine genera
(plural of genus) and seventy percent of land vertebrate vanished for
good. Even insects suffered a **[[mass extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- the only time before or since. Entire classes of animals -- like
trilobites -- went out like a match in the wind.

But **[what's arguably most fascinating about this event -- known as the
Permian-Triassic extinction]{.underline}** or more poetically, the Great
Dying -- **[is the fact that anything survived at all.
[Life]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it seems, **[[is]{.mark} so ridiculously
[adaptable]{.mark} that not only did [thousands of species make it
through]{.mark} whatever killed off nearly everything]{.underline}** (no

millions of years life even recovered and went on to write new

Even as **[[the Permian]{.mark}-Triassic
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}** event shows the fragility of life, it
also **[[proves its resilience]{.mark} in the long-term]{.underline}**.
**[The lessons of such mass extinctions -- five to date and arguably a
sixth happening as I write -- inform science today]{.underline}**.
**[Given that extinction levels are currently 1,000]{.underline}** (some
even say 10,000**[) times the background rate, researchers have long
worried about our current destruction of biodiversity -- and what that
may mean for our future Earth and ourselves]{.underline}**.

In 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for
the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an
uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include
climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes,
biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the
terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it "biosphere
integrity," but that hasn't spared it from critique.

A paper last year in Trends in Ecology & Evolution scathingly attacked
the idea of any global biodiversity boundary.

["**[It makes no sense that there exists a tipping
point]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of biodiversity loss beyond which the
Earth will collapse]{.underline}**," **[said co-author and ecologist,
José Montoya, with Paul Sabatier Univeristy in France. "There is no
rationale for this."]{.underline}**

Montoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity
College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world's leading experts
on extinctions, with Duke University in the US.

Montoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that **[[there isn't evidence]{.mark} of
a point at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, globally
or even locally. If the planet didn't collapse after the
Permian-Triassic extinction event, [it won't collapse
now]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- though our descendants may well curse us
for the damage we've done.

Instead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But
**[the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden
plunge.]{.underline}** **[[Ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according
to them, **[slowly degrade but [never fail
outright]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"**[[Of]{.mark} more than [600 experiments]{.mark} of biodiversity
effects on various functions, [none showed a
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Montoya said. "In general, the loss of
species has a detrimental effect on ecosystem functions\...We
progressively lose pollination services, water quality, plant biomass,
and many other important functions as we lose species. But **[we never
observe a critical level of biodiversity over which functions
collapse."]{.underline}**

### 1NC\-\--Arctic Routes Not Feasible

#### Shipping routes in the Arctic aren't feasible -- Russian control, weather/predictability, and lack of search and rescue capacity.

**[The high price of Middle East transit routes. The surging costs and
fear of getting hit by Houthi drones and missiles have led [some
shippers]{.mark} to [consider the Arctic as an alternative, as melting
ice begins opening new potential on the so-called Northern Sea
Route]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Stretching from the Barents Sea near
Russia's border with Norway all the way to the Bering Strait between
Siberia and Alaska, the Northern Sea Route has been eyed by major naval
powers as a possible shortcut for sea travel between Europe and Asia for
centuries, but [**[the region's unforgiving frozen climate and extreme
remoteness have made such ambitions infeasible.]{.underline}**
B]{.mark}ut today, climate change is occurring four times faster in the
Arctic than anywhere else on the planet, and massive levels of ice melt
in the region from rising global temperatures have led to wild
speculation about the route becoming commercially viable in the near
future. At first blush, going north looks promising. The route is about
8,000 miles between some parts of Europe and Asia, compared with about
13,000 miles for the Suez Canal route. The ability to slash some 5,000
miles off a ship's journey would mean much faster travel times---a major
plus in today's world of online retail and next-day delivery. But here
in Norway, where the midnight sun will keep it light out all day and all
night for the next three months of the year, **[[officials and experts
are skeptical that the route will be viable anytime soon. "Short answer,
viability close to zero,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** Halvorsen said.
**["[It's not a realistic alternative in the foreseeable
future."]{.mark}]{.underline}** Treacherous waters. **[[Why the
pessimism? It's a combination of great-power politics and treacherous
terrain. Russian authorities control most of the Northern Sea
Route]{.mark},]{.underline}** Halvorsen said---**[[about 70 percent of
the Arctic---and ships wanting to use the route must secure the
Russians' permission and pay them transit fees. Given current relations
between many Western countries and Russia amid the Ukraine war, that
poses an obvious challenge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The waters close to
the shoreline that are safest for navigation are also very shallow,
which means shippers would need to cut down their tonnage and use
vessels smaller than container ships or go farther out to sea where the
weather is much worse. **[[There's very little ability to get search and
rescue boats into the area. If a vessel]{.mark} like the Ever
Given---the 1,300-foot-long container ship that ran aground and snagged
traffic in the Suez Canal (and lit social media ablaze) for six days in
2021---[got stranded here, there might be no way to get it
out.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Lucky crews might get helicoptered out.
Unlucky crews could risk being polar bear food. Shippers would also need
vessels strong enough to withstand thick polar sea ice to get through,
which would raise the price even more. And once the midnight sun goes
down in August, the Arctic Circle will be engulfed in 24-hour darkness
for the next six months. Even with melting ice sheets now accounting for
more than a quarter of sea level rise, **[[experts said the ice
conditions in the Arctic have been more challenging in the past decade,
not less. "Due to the distances, the weather, the darkness, \[and the\]
floating ice, the predictability of moving along this route is so low
that it's not worth the reduced number of days]{.mark} compared to
around either Suez or Africa]{.underline}**," Halvorsen added. Not so
limitless. China may be interested in trying to transit the Northern Sea
Route anyway, experts said, to show off its growing great-power status.
Doing that, however, could test the limits of China and Russia's
self-described "limitless" partnership. Beijing has even put out its own
Arctic strategy centered on extending its military capabilities into the
region, developing infrastructure, and participating in governance
efforts---some of which have been put on hold since Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine two years ago. But China might be wary of going too
far, especially since Russia still sees the region as its strategic
backyard. "If China pushes Russia too hard in the Arctic, I think the
Russians would be very skeptical," said Jo Inge Bekkevold, a senior
China fellow at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies (IFS) and a
former Norwegian diplomat. "The main strategic asset of Russia today is
the Northern Fleet in the Arctic. And this is one area where I think
they would like to keep China at a certain distance." The Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank,
reported last year that Russia has three major bases in the region, 13
airfields, and 10 radar stations. And the Northern Fleet's submarine
base at Gadzhiyevo is only about 125 miles from the Finnish border,
which is now NATO turf. "Russia's attention for the High North has been
standing strong," said Katarzyna Zysk, a scholar at IFS. "The Northern
Fleet is still capable of performing its core missions." Baby steps. For
now, China is making careful, calculated, and limited moves to expand
its influence in the Arctic---with an emphasis on limited. Experts said
the only Chinese projects that have gained significant traction in the
Arctic so far are gas drilling rigs on the Yamal Peninsula in Russia. In
2022, not a single Chinese vessel transited the Northern Sea Route, said
Henrik Stalhane Hiim, an associate professor at IFS tracking China's
activity in the region. China has a research station at Svalbard,
Norway's northernmost archipelago near the North Pole, but it has been
mostly quiet for the past four years since the COVID-19 pandemic. And
not a single Chinese navy vessel has ever crossed the Arctic Circle,
Hiim said. But even for China, the biggest issue comes back to economic
viability. Most of China's exports come out of the country's southern
provinces, such as Guangdong, which provide easier access to shipping
lanes such as the Suez instead of northern routes. For China, "it's not
shorter to sail. It's longer," said Bekkevold of the Northern Sea Route.
"Because if you sail from Shanghai through the Indian Ocean, through the
Suez, then you end up in Trieste in Italy or Piraeus in Greece, that is
shorter than sailing the Northern Sea Route." And in the world of
shipping, which relies on predictability, one or two days of delay can
lead to a big surge in costs. For now, China has negotiated a hefty
insurance discount for Red Sea transits to protect its ships even as the
Houthis continue to target Western shippers. But chronic instability in
the Middle East will only make Arctic sea lanes, however treacherous,
more attractive to the emerging global superpower.

### 1NC\-\--Tariffs Thump Trade/Shipping

#### Trump's tariff wars thump trade and global shipping. Means aff can't solve.

**Dayen 4/24**

\[David Dayen, April 24, 2025, "The Permanent Tariff Damage," Accessed
7/4/25,
<https://prospect.org/economy/2025-04-24-permanent-tariff-damage/>, VY\]

Wall Street is certainly desperate for any note of conciliation, and
Trump saying he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve chair
Jerome Powell made them even more ebullient. But let's get real. The
proposed tariff cuts would only come as part of negotiations, not
unilaterally. (Stocks fell back on that news.) Even a 65 percent cut
would still leave a 50 percent tariff on China, which may not change the
trading dynamics that likely forced Trump into proposing the reductions.
And businesses have seen tariff rates ping-pong multiple times just this
month, making it impossible to plan or invest. Perhaps most important,
China now knows it has a paper tiger across the negotiating table, and
can hold out for the best deal. That would be true even if Trump were
still ranting on Truth Social every hour about breaking China's
will---because the Chinese can read the news like anyone else. More
important, they can see what's happening at their own ports. [**[A TERM
OF ART IN GLOBAL SHIPPING is "blank sailings." It refers to canceled
voyages, or the skipping of ports along a route. Since the tariffs were
initially announced on April 2, blank sailings, particularly across the
Pacific Ocean, have increased more than sixfold,]{.underline}**
from]{.mark} 60,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs, a standard
measurement of cargo capacity) to 367,800. One of the three major
freight alliances has suspended an entire route that stops in several
Chinese cities on the way to Vancouver and Tacoma, Washington.
[**[Overall, there's been a sharp decline in container volume from China
to the U.S. at the main ports that take in Chinese
goods.]{.underline}**]{.mark} One logistics CEO says that bookings have
been reduced by 60 percent. **[Some of this is due to demand that was
pulled forward as shippers tried to beat the clock before tariffs were
imposed]{.underline}**, and some is due to new fees on Chinese ships
that took effect last week. **[But [in reality, 145 percent tariffs are
effectively an embargo. ]{.mark}]{.underline}**Incoming vessels at the
Port of Los Angeles, the nation's largest and the primary hub for
Chinese goods, will go down by nearly half in the next two weeks, as
shippers transition from beating the tariffs to cold reality. Yet
exports to China are running worse, something that was happening even
before the tariff announcement. Empty containers leaving L.A. were up 23
percent in March, with overall bookings running near the level of April
2020, when there was a nationwide lockdown due to the pandemic.
"American companies over-ordered imports ahead of tariffs, but foreign
buyers did not increase their demand for American exports," the website
Data and Politics notes. In other words, the trade deficit, far from
declining, has been exacerbated by tariff chaos in the first month. And
if empties keep getting shipped abroad, exporters might have trouble
sourcing containers to carry their goods. China now knows it has a paper
tiger across the negotiating table, and can hold out for the best deal.
**[Obviously[, shipping companies are taking a hit;]{.mark} shares in
U.S.-flagged Matson are down 30 percent from the peak. But the overall
drop in volume has ripple effects for other businesses dependent on
trade, like trucking.]{.underline}** Workers making Mack Trucks, a
division of Volvo, are being laid off nationwide as expected demand
sinks. And companies that put trucks on the road will simply have fewer
goods to take across the country. Manufacturing companies are supposed
to benefit from high import barriers, but with their component parts
facing levies, conditions are now sharply negative. Even S&P Global's
manufacturing index, which was relatively brighter than others, showed a
16-month low in business activity growth. And import-reliant sectors
like housing, which was already on a downswing because the supply
pipeline was diminishing, are poised to pause construction to avoid
higher costs on materials like Canadian lumber. (This has some
developers thrilled because they get to charge higher rents. Yay.) Many
importers are trying to find other manufacturing sources or cutting
costs elsewhere. But some are just putting a stop to everything, while
waiting to see if deals can be struck. [**[That sudden stop puts
enormous pressure on shipping, trucking, warehouses, and everything else
that makes the economy function.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Those companies
don't have unlimited reserves to avoid bankruptcy while Trump dithers.
But the real impact would be visible not just to trucking and shipping
CEOs, but every consumer trying to buy things this summer. It's not
possible to backfill the volume of canceled orders from China and
elsewhere in such a short period of time. That means empty shelves. It's
not surprising that this latest turnaround came right after Trump met
with top executives at Walmart and Target. Apparently in that meeting,
Trump was told that shortages would occur without some action taken. As
Walmart's rise to market dominance has been powered for many decades by
its cultivation of and reliance on Chinese imports, this should not have
come as a surprise. The effective embargo would create other shortages
in critical components, such as parts for transformers and air
conditioners. But Trump thinks in terms of visuals, and the big one is a
Walmart with nothing for sale, or a run on thrift stores as new goods
are absent. That would be deadly to his approval rating and he knows it.

### 1NC\-\--!/D\-\--Arctic / US-Russia War

#### Arctic shipping disputes don't go nuke -- complexity overwhelms solvency

International Relations and European Studies, Faculty of Social Studies,

Analysis of Conflict Potential in the Arctic," Europe-Asia Studies, pp.

In general, [[the legal regime of the Arctic is
based]{.underline}]{.mark} on ([[fragmented]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[international]{.underline}]{.mark} law [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[domestic law]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Arctic-8 states (Drumbl &
Uhlířová 2021). [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} legal
[[systems]{.underline}]{.mark} and specific rules [[intersect and
interact, making Arctic governance **complex and
multifaceted**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Schönfeldt 2020). This is clear in
the context of the 1920 Svalbard Treaty, which recognises Norway's
sovereignty over the archipelago while allowing commercial activities
(including mining or fishing) by other treaty parties, based on the
principle of non-discrimination of foreigners. Despite this, Norway is
not willing to treat citizens of other treaty parties equally with
regard to operations on the continental shelf around Svalbard, as became
evident in a dispute regarding fishing for snow crab on the seabed. In
this context, Norway claims exclusive rights over the continental shelf
surrounding Svalbard on the basis of UNCLOS, which grants the coastal
state the right to treat its own nationals preferentially (Oystein
2020). Other states argue that Norway's regulation of waters beyond its
territorial sea should be subject to the [[Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark}
Treaty, which [[prohibits discrimination on the basis of
nationality]{.underline}]{.mark} in relation to certain activities,
[[giving foreigners **equal** rights]{.underline}]{.mark} to hunting,
fishing and mining in Svalbard and its territorial seas (Article 2
Svalbard Treaty). The rules of the [[UNCLOS and
Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Treaty are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[[perceived as contradictory]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fishing for snow
crabs by Latvia and other EU member states in this area has contributed
to an ongoing legal and diplomatic dispute between Norway, the EU and
other parties to the Svalbard Treaty7 on the status of waters
surrounding Svalbard and on fishing rights. These disputes culminated in
confrontational actions, such as Norway's 2017 detention of the Latvian
vessel Senator, which was operating on the Norwegian continental shelf
without a permit from the Norwegian authorities. Not willing to risk
straining the EU's bilateral relations with Norway, the European
Commission sought solutions based on dialogue and a constructive
approach, regardless of how much time this would take (European
Commission 2020, par. 53, 54). Recently, Russia has been increasing its
presence in Svalbard within the terms of the Svalbard Treaty (Nilsen
2021; McVicar 2022). Despite tensions between Russia and Norway on
several issues, the chief of Norway's intelligence service stated in
2022 that Russia 'acts more careful\[ly\], \[with\] self-restraint here
\[in the north\] compared with what they do in the Baltic Sea and
especially in contrast to the Black Sea ... . It is our understanding
that Russia wants low tensions and stability in the north' (Nilsen
2022).

Several other issues remain unsettled in the context of continental
shelf claims, by which Arctic states aim to extend their continental
shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from coastal baselines. The largest
disputes involve Russia, Denmark (by virtue of Greenland) and Canada.
However, all these states have agreed to follow the rules laid down in
UNCLOS, which means that they have agreed to submit scientific evidence
to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (UN CLCS).
Indeed, in 2021, Russia filed a submission to the UN CLCS to extend its
claim to the Arctic Ocean seabed, which overlaps with those of Canada
and Denmark. Russian claims currently cover around 70% of the Arctic
Ocean seabed (Breum 2021). In 2023, the UN CLCS actually approved most
of Russia's claim while Denmark and Canada still have their claims
unresolved (Hager 2023). While this move could potentially increase
tensions between Russia and other Arctic states, as long as the process
follows UNCLOS provisions the states involved might be 'amenable to the
expansion' (Kuras 2021). [[The **only** dispute in the Arctic relating
to **land** territory involves Hans Island]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
remains a point of contention [[between Denmark and
Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet, [[the island is 'little more than an
**irritant'**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the relationship between the two
countries (Olesen 2017). Although both states have acknowledged the idea
of splitting Hans Island, an agreement has yet to be reached.

[[In addition to the above examples of peaceful resolution of
territorial disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} and treaty observance,
[[cooperative actions are further supported by]{.underline}]{.mark} a
'complex network of [[institutionalised]{.underline}]{.mark} relations'
(Chrášťanský & Kříž 2011) and coalition-building. The
[[soft-law]{.underline}]{.mark} regime of the Arctic Council (AC) has
been described as 'the most comprehensive international body [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} region' (Byers 2013). Institutionally, the
AC, International Maritime Organisation and Barents Euro-Arctic
Co-operation have an especially important role in resolving specific
issues. [[The Declaration on]{.underline}]{.mark} the Establishment of
[[the Arctic Council of 1996 explicitly]{.underline}]{.mark} stated that
it would [[promote cooperative activities]{.underline}]{.mark} while not
dealing with matters related to military security (Arctic Council 1996).
Global geopolitical issues and power competition were therefore excluded
in this leading inter-governmental forum even during conflicts such as
Russia's illegal use of force in Crimea in 2014, when Russia de facto
annexed Crimea and faced international sanctions (Byers 2017; Dodds &
Woon 2020). However, [[Russian actions **outside** the Arctic can affect
relations]{.underline}]{.mark} with other Arctic states, a clear example
being Russia's 2022 military aggression against Ukraine, which has
'substantially affected' Russian relations with Norway, the US and
Canada, and introduced elements of heightened competition and tension
into the Arctic's geopolitical environment.8 There have been various
[[treaty-like cooperative initiatives, such as the 2018 US--Russia
scheme for managing two-way shipping traffic through the Bering Sea and
the 2020 US and Russia Joint Contingency Plan for combating maritime
pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}.9 Nonetheless, increased tensions and
competition are apparent, for example, due to the NATO exercises Trident
Juncture 18, held in 2018, and Cold Response, held in 2022, with a total
of about 30,000 soldiers, marines and airmen from 27 countries
participating (NATO 2022a).

In the last decade, the AC has become 'the focal point for
treaty-making' in the Arctic (Koivurova 2014). In 2011, the AC members
adopted a search-and-rescue treaty (Arctic Council 2011a) as a first
legally binding instrument under the auspices of the AC (Byers 2017). A
second binding instrument on cooperation on marine-oil pollution
preparedness and response was signed at the Kiruna Ministerial Meeting
in 2013 (Arctic Council 2013), while a third legally binding agreement,
negotiated under the auspices of the AC and signed in 2017, aimed to
enhance international Arctic scientific cooperation (Arctic Council
2017). All AC observers10 affirm (Arctic Council 2011b, p. 50) the
primacy of the Arctic-8 states' sovereignty and jurisdiction in the
Arctic (Rainwater 2015). Lastly, the 2013 admission of China as an
observer in the AC means that all five UN Security Council permanent
members are now either members or observers of the AC (Charron 2014).

[[Despite their divergent interests, the Arctic-8 countries are
**united** in their resistance to any attempts by non-Arctic
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as Germany or France) [[to
interfere]{.underline}]{.mark} with their division of the Arctic (Olesen
2017), as also illustrated by the Ilulissat Declaration of 2008, a joint
regional effort in response to the effects of climate change. The
Ilulissat Declaration was brought by the coastal states of the Arctic
Ocean (the United States, the Russian Federation, Canada, Norway and
Denmark), which claim to be in 'a unique position to address these
possibilities and challenges' (2008 Ilulissat Declaration).

Even [[with regard to unresolved claims, the **tendency** is to engage
in negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark} (Staalesen 2021) or to submit these
claims to relevant institutions, such as the UN CLCS. The majority of
existing territorial disputes have thus far been resolved peacefully
and, at least for the foreseeable future, the remaining unresolved
disputes are highly unlikely to lead to international armed conflict
(Chrášťanský & Kříž 2011; Rainwater 2015; Olesen 2017). After all,
stability and cooperation are needed for the economic development of the
Arctic. In addition, most of the natural resources (including offshore
energy) are located in uncontested areas (Byers 2013; Olesen 2017).
[[**Rather than** (military) conflict, we]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[[observe a **long-term** trend of deepening cooperation and mutual
interest]{.underline}]{.mark} in employing the existing international
institutional and legal framework, which may at times be coloured by
competition among some Arctic states (Chrášťanský & Kříž 2011; Olesen
2017).

In conclusion, the evidence shows that [[the Arctic-8 continue to
behave]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly in a cooperative manner,
[[**without** increasing rivalry]{.underline}]{.mark}. While this trend
did not change after the illegal annexation of Crimea, since Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, certain tensions with regard to the Arctic can be
observed. Overall, however, disputes in the region have, thus far, been
dealt with [[in a **peaceful, diplomatic and multilateral**
way]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Arctic-8 have agreed to follow the rules
laid down in the UNCLOS and other regional treaties and customary rules
of international law. Based on this, [[we can expect that the
cooperative approach]{.underline}]{.mark} to territorial disputes [[will
**endure**]{.underline}]{.mark} at least [[for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The new US military strategy in the Arctic
considers]{.underline}]{.mark} the policies of the
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n Federation [[and China
as]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[destabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark} factor in
the region [[and leaves no space for cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}
with them, [[which may lead to an escalation of
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region in the medium term. The US
has gained a significant geopolitical advantage due to its guaranteed
military presence in Finland and Sweden. At the same time, [[the
strategy does not contain a clear statement of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} that come from the Russian Federation and
China. The [[plans for]{.underline}]{.mark} a very specific [[build-up
of infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark} and the US/NATO military presence
in the Arctic [[are a response to **imaginary**
threats]{.underline}]{.mark} that could only hypothetically arise
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n
Federation [[and China. Apparently, there is still no consensus within
the US Department of Defense and the expert and analytical community on
the content of the US military policy in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is largely [[due to the reluctance to
get involved in a military escalation with Russia and the understanding
that the US has insufficient resources for a more offensive policy in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### 1NC\-\--!/D\-\--AT: Econ / War

#### Economic decline [doesn't]{.underline} link to [war]{.underline}. [Empirics]{.underline} prove that leaders [avoid]{.underline} wars that aren't [quick]{.underline}, [cheap]{.underline}, and a [sure]{.underline}-[thing]{.underline}\-\--econ wars are [none]{.underline} of those things.

2020. Foreign Policy "Will a Global Depression Trigger Another World
War?"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>
// ***mosuQ***\]

On balance, however, [I [do not think]{.mark} that [even]{.mark} the
**[extraordinary economic conditions]{.mark}** we are witnessing
today are going to [have much **impact** on the **likelihood
of war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why? First of all, [if depressions were a
powerful **cause** of war, there would be **a lot more** of the
latter]{.underline}. To take one
example, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has suffered **40**]{.mark}** or more
[recessions]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the country was
founded, [yet it
has [fought]{.mark} perhaps **[20]{.mark} interstate [wars]{.mark}**,
most of them [**unrelated** to the]{.mark} state
of the **[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To paraphrase the economist
Paul Samuelson's famous quip about the stock market, if recessions were
a powerful cause of war, they would have predicted "nine out of the last
five (or fewer)."

Second, [states do not start wars unless they believe they will **win a
quick and relatively cheap victory**]{.underline}. As John Mearsheimer
showed in his classic book Conventional Deterrence, national
leaders avoid war when they are convinced it will
be long, bloody, costly, and uncertain. [To choose war, political
[leaders have to convince themselves they can]{.mark} either [win a
**quick, cheap, and decisive victory**]{.mark} or achieve some limited
objective at low cost]{.underline}. Europe went to war in 1914 with each
side believing it would win a rapid and easy victory, and Nazi Germany
developed the strategy of blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes as
quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq attacked Iran in 1980 because
Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was in disarray and would be easy
to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 convinced the war
would be short, successful, and pay for itself.

The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter
the main point: [No matter what a country's economic condition might
be, its leaders will not go to war unless they think they can do
so quickly, cheaply, and with a reasonable probability
of success]{.underline}.

Third, and most important, [[the primary motivation]{.mark} for most
wars [is the desire for **security,
not economic gain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For this reason, the odds of
war increase when states believe the long-term balance of power may be
shifting against them, when they are convinced that adversaries are
unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and when they are
confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and establish a secure
position if they act now. The historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed
that "every war between Great Powers \[between 1848 and 1918\]
... started as a preventive war, not as a war of conquest," and that
remains true of most wars fought since then.

The bottom line: Economic conditions (i.e., a depression) may affect the
broader political environment in which decisions for war or peace are
made, but they are only one factor among many and rarely the
most significant. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic has [[large, lasting,
and negative effects
on the]{.mark} world [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}---as seems quite
likely---it is [[**not likely** to affect the **probability
of war**]{.mark} very much, especially in the short term]{.underline}.

**1NC\-\--Space/Sats Advantage**

**[1NC\-\--Security K Link\-\--Space Col]{.underline}**

**Space colonization is a "[cultural ritual]{.underline}" celebrating a
"fresh start" for the [highest class]{.underline} while leaving
[marginalized]{.underline} populations to [suffer]{.underline}. This is
sustained through [securitized]{.underline} narratives that justify
[evacuation]{.underline} of Earth with claims of its [inevitable
doom]{.underline}, draining potential to face [existential
crises]{.underline}.**

University, Bloomington), June 2017, "Should Humans Colonize Other
Planets? No," Theology and Science, Vol. 15, No. 3, pp. 1-12, njn\]

[The **belief system** perpetuated by [the]{.mark}]{.underline} rhetoric
of [[advocacy for **colonizing other planets** and
**exploiting**]{.mark} extraterrestrial
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as described here, [[is]{.mark} a
variant of **[nationalist ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline}\--an American
spirituality or even American orthodoxy\--[[which **excludes**]{.mark}
or rejects as **unenlightened** [those who do not
agree]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 In this sense, [space advocacy can be
viewed as [a **cultural ritual**]{.mark}]{.underline}, performed
[[for]{.mark} the purpose of **[maintaining social order]{.mark}**, with
its **lopsided** distribution of **power** and **resources**,
[perpetuating]{.mark} the [values of those in
**control**]{.mark}]{.underline} of that order -- in this case,
[primarily the **military-industrial** complex]{.underline}. In short,
economic injustice is tied to space colonization proposals.

In order [[to **survive**]{.mark} as a cultural institution, [**space
exploration** needs]{.mark} an **[ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
needs to have some connection to widely held beliefs. It needs a role in
a cultural narrative. But a new narrative is warranted to replace the
outdated and counterproductive nationalistic expansionist story.

Some broader perspectives have been offered over the years. In 1965, the
visionary economist Kenneth Boulding said our planet had already "become
a space ship, not only in our imagination but also in the hard realities
of the social, biological, and physical system in which \[humans are\]
enmeshed.... Man is finally going to have to face the fact that he is a
biological system living in an ecological system, and that his survival
power is going to depend on his developing symbiotic relationships of a
closed-cycle character with all the other elements and populations of
the world of ecological systems.... It is clear," he concluded, "that
much human behavior and many human institutions...are entirely
inappropriate to a small closed space ship. We cannot have cowboys and
Indians...or even a cowboy ethic...."36

Rhetorical critic Janice Hocker Rushing once made the case that the
post-Apollo-era focus of space exploration on the search for evidence of
extraterrestrial life was a product of a widespread understanding that
humankind exists in a universe, not only on planet Earth. The narrative
of space exploration thus might better reflect this understanding by
telling a story of "a spiritual humbling of self" rather than "an
imperialistic grabbing of territory."37

And cultural studies scholar Constance Penley has observed that while
"the WASP space cowboy version of spaceflight" has persisted from the
Apollo era into the present, at the same time NASA "is still the most
popular point of reference for utopian ideas of collective progress." In
the popular imagination, she said, "NASA continues to
represent...perseverance, cooperation, creativity and vision," and these
meanings embedded in the narrative of space flight "can still be
mobilized to rejuvenate the near-moribund idea of a future toward which
dedicated people...could work together for the common good."38

Roman Catholic theologian and self-described "space buff" Rev. Theodore
Hesburgh (1917-2015) gave a talk at a "space roundtable" in 1990 in
which he hoped that space exploration could lead us to a better human
future here on Earth. "I take as our most compelling symbol" pictures of
Earth taken from space, he said. What do these images "say to us?"
First, they show no differences or divisions among nations or people.
"Is not this vision laden with other philosophical and theological
implications: that, like Planet Earth, humankind is one and potentially
more beautiful than our past history has indicated; that we survive
together or we perish together in this unitary habitat, sharing the same
hospitable climate, the air, the water, the land, and, more
significantly, those spiritual yearnings for knowledge, freedom, peace,
development, a civilization marked by justice, not the wars that
injustice spawns?" "The challenge here," he said, "is to create a human
spiritual unity of understanding and a justice that matches the physical
beauty of this planet that is a pure gift to us, and to use it together
and not to abuse it separately."

Other space-faring nations capable of sending humans into space -- that
is, [China and Russia]{.underline} -- [are]{.underline} also believed to
be [**advancing plans** for further human **exploration**]{.underline}
and exploitation of the solar system. [There is **every reason** to
assume that **Russia** and **China** are intent on **keeping up** with
the United States in claiming territories and resources]{.underline}.

For hundreds (if not thousands) of years, [[human societies]{.mark} have
[tried and **failed** to create "**new worlds**"]{.mark} on Earth,
[beginning "anew" and "**leaving** the **worst
behind**."]{.mark}]{.underline} [The current state of [human societies
give]{.mark}]{.underline}s [**[no indication]{.mark}** that [we

In its current state of moral development, [the author finds [humankind
**unfit** to engage in]{.mark} the **[colonization]{.mark}** of other
planets [and]{.mark} the [**exploitation** of **outerspace
resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rhetoric aside, [[advocates]{.mark} of
**colonization** and exploitation [present **no ev**]{.mark}idence for
their claims [that **human societies** wil]{.mark}l be able "**[start
anew]{.mark}**" off Earth, [**free of the problems** we've
created]{.mark} for ourselves]{.underline} and others here on Earth. The
idea [[that only a **select few**, who can afford]{.mark} to pay [a
**high price**, will]{.mark} be able to [**escape** the nest we've
**fouled**]{.mark}]{.underline} on Earth, [**[leaving the poor]{.mark}**
and disadvantaged to live [in the mess, is]{.mark} **morally** and
**[ethically suspect]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Except for the threads of Russian cosmism, the ideology of space
colonization and exploitation is largely Western, and Christian, as
noted above. It appears to be some interpretation of Christian dominion,
or dominionist, theology that drives colonization advocates to declare
that humans are destined to fill the universe, that humans "must"
colonize Mars, that outer space resources are there for the taking.

The author identifies as a humanistic Unitarian Universalist and, as
such, affirm and promote the seven UU principles as a moral guide. Among
the UU principles guiding this critique of the idea of space
colonization and exploitation are the inherent dignity and worth and
dignity of every person; justice, equity, and compassion in human
relations; the goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice
for all; and respect for the interdependent web of all existence of
which we are a part.

More than 40 years after Kenneth Boulding told us we had to get the
message, space exploration is enabling people on Earth to understand
that we are biological systems living in an ecological system. This
competing narrative may be a site within which the ideology of space
exploration might rejuvenate itself -- where the vision of a human
future in space becomes a vision of humanity's collective peaceful
existence on Spaceship Earth and the need to work together to preserve
life here and look for life out there. This competing narrative coexists
with the now-dominant narrative of conquest and exploitation. It remains
to be seen how these competing narratives play out in the dominant
social order over the next few decades.

While the DoD uses an extra layer of encryption to protect the content

the ground infrastructure of satellite communication provider Viasat
crippled the Ukrainian forces' access to satellite-communication
services on the eve of the invasion. The incident, which according to
analysts was planned by Russian state-backed hackers for months,
revealed the weakness of Viasat's cyberdefenses. [Since then, [the

debris **

The History of Orbital Debris Creation 

[[Since]{.mark} the beginning of [the space age, there have been]{.mark}
more than [550 confirmed "fragmentation events"]{.mark} in Earth orbit,
each event [generating]{.mark} new orbital [debris]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Such events have various causes, and some are responsible for creating
far greater quantities of debris than others. [Notably, the deliberate
destruction of the Chinese Fengyun-1C spacecraft in 2007 and the
accidental [collision of]{.mark} an American and a Russian
[spacecraft]{.mark} in 2009 [increased]{.mark} the tracked orbital
[debris]{.mark} population in LEO [by]{.mark} approximately
[70%]{.mark}.]{.underline} The causes of fragmentation events and
frequency of occurrence as of December 2020 are provided below: 

[ PROPULSION -- 39.52%]{.underline} Energy left undisposed of on-board a
satellite or rocket body can lead to accidental explosions, for example
due to heat stress. [DELIBERATE -- 23.77%]{.underline} All intentional
breakup events, e.g. satellites designed to explode if atmospheric
re-entry went wrong or detonated as standard procedure once the mission
ended, as well as military tests. [UNKNOWN -- 14.29%]{.underline}
Assigned whenever there is insufficient evidence to support a more
specific classification. [ANOMALOUS -- 5.64%]{.underline} Unplanned
separation of one or more detectable objects from a satellite that
remains essentially intact, e.q. objects shedding due to material
degradation such as insulation material or solar panels. [COLLISION --
9.01%]{.underline} There have been several collisions observed between
known obiects. In some cases, the impactor is too small to be observed,
but changes in the orientation and functioning of the satellite indicate
an impact has occurred. [ELECTRICAL -- 6.4%]{.underline} Events related
to failures in electrical subsystems, most due to overcharged batteries
exploding. [ACCIDENTAL -- 0.8%]{.underline} Design flaws ultimately
leading to breakups. [AERODYNAMICS -- 0.56%]{.underline} A breakup most
often caused when atmospheric drag leads to "overpressure."

The good news is that as a consequence of experience, technological
progress, and internationally applied space debris mitigation measures,
there will likely be far fewer fragmentation events (with the possible
exception of on-orbit collisions). Most internationally accepted space
debris mitigation measures can be traced back to the following
objectives:

The limitation of space debris released during normal operations; The
minimisation of the potential for on-orbit break-ups; Post mission
disposal; and Prevention of on-orbit collisions. Aspirationally, these
objectives lead to a future in which space debris is not an issue.

[The bad news is that [with **space traffic increasing, the number
of**]{.mark} **in-space [collisions]{.mark}** [are expected to
rise]{.mark}]{.underline} -- recent satellite conjunction data
illustrates the problem. A satellite conjunction is an event in which
two satellites or a satellite and a piece of space debris are estimated
to pass near each other. The following chart shows conjunction events
and corresponding space debris or satellite classification which is
causing the conjunction (data is based upon a set of representative
missions over 2021). The chart shows the conjunction events by orbital
altitude. [Note that these [conjunction events could trigger an operator
response but not necessarily an avoidance]{.mark} manoeuvre nor a
collision.]{.underline} [In the lower altitude orbits, [the majority of
the conjunctions are caused by constellation satellites or small
satellites]{.mark} rather than orbital debris.]{.underline}

Almost 70 years later, [the number of active satellites in orbit exceeds
**8,000**]{.underline}, with capabilities ranging from communications
and navigation to climate monitoring and astronomical observation. In
recent years, the commercialization of space has yielded breakthroughs,
particularly in LEO, offering competitive consumer broadband speeds,
better Earth imaging, and use cases straight out of a science fiction
novel. But [[as the **number** of objects]{.mark} in space
**[increases]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly as companies begin to
climb over one another to deploy their own satellite constellations, the
[**[negative externalities]{.mark}** of this frenzy [are]{.mark}
becoming **[apparent]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As the Union of Concerned Scientists notes, a fragment of junk as small
as 1 cm in diameter can cause serious damage to a satellite. NASA
estimates that there are well over half a million objects larger than 1
cm currently in orbit, on average traveling about 10 times the speed of
a bullet. Others suggest there could be twice this many.

These [[circumstances pose]{.mark} not only an individualized
risk]{.underline} to satellites in orbit, [but [an **existential
risk**]{.mark} to humanity's future as a spacefaring
species]{.underline}. Because a [[collision will]{.mark} itself
**[generate]{.mark}** additional debris]{.underline}, in a sufficiently
dense orbital environment, [a single collision could trigger others,
which in turn trigger still others, producing [a **domino
effect**]{.mark} commonly [referred to as]{.mark} the **[Kessler
Syndrome]{.mark}**]{.underline} after NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler.
The resulting debris field could make entire orbits unusable, or even
impassable, [effectively [**ending** human space
exploration]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Consequently, multiple government agencies and scientific organizations
have endeavored to catalogue and track as many of these hazards as
possible. But even if we could track every piece of dangerous debris (we
cannot), situational awareness would not be enough. Debris is increasing
at an alarming rate, and little is being done to slow its creation, much
less reduce the overall number of objects. Instead, satellite operators
continue to propose thousands and thousands of new satellites, relying
on a dangerous mixture of techno-optimism and market mysticism to
provide unspecified solutions to the problem at some later date.

Sputnik's spent rocket was little more than a footnote at the dawn of
the space race, reentering the atmosphere as anticipated less than two
months after launch. Today, we cannot afford to relegate space debris to
the margins.

The Scale of the Problem

Nobody is really sure exactly how much debris is already in orbit.
Estimates for objects greater than 1 centimeter in diameter range from
around half a million to over one million. Of these, there are perhaps
55,000 which we can conceivably track, and around 27,000 which are
currently tracked by the United States' Space Surveillance Network.
Thankfully, this covers the most catastrophic possible collisions, but
likely accounts for somewhere between 2-5% of all problematic debris.

The issue becomes all the more concerning when one realizes just how
quickly the rate of satellite deployment has increased, with no sign of
slowing. The number of satellites launched in 2023 was nearly fourteen
times the number launched in 2013, itself a record setting year. SpaceX
alone now boasts plans for a constellation of 42,000 satellites --
almost three times the number of objects put into space since 1957. Its
competitors in the United States, China, and Europe are not far behind.

Worse still, the European Space Agency (ESA) projects that [[we]{.mark}
have already [reached a **critical density** in]{.mark} orbit such that
[debris]{.mark} would **continue** to increase over the next 200 years
and beyond, **even if** we were to **stop launching** new
objects]{.underline} entirely. Since we are unlikely to do that, we can
instead expect a dramatic rise in both the creation of objects greater
than 1 centimeter in diameter and the likelihood of "catastrophic
collisions" (collisions that cause the complete destruction of both the
target and impactor).

All this is to say that despite the vast distances at play in orbit,
[low Earth orbit in particular is becoming [a]{.mark} combination
shooting gallery and **[ticking time bomb]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

**Space debris makes it harder to execute more space missions -- turns
the case.**

[[**Space debris poses an existential threat** to the space
sector]{.mark} as a whole]{.underline} (commercial space industry and
government agencies alike) and hence the future space economy. While
having a space debris graveyard orbiting the Earth does not currently
have a direct impact on humans, [it does have severe financial
consequences on space activities.]{.underline} [[Not only does]{.mark}
the increasing amount of **space [debris make it]{.mark} more [difficult
for new satellites and]{.mark} space [missions]{.mark}** to pass through
Earth's orbit, [but]{.mark} increasing space [debris will cause]{.mark}
an [increasing]{.mark} number of in orbit
[collisions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Protecting satellites from space
debris is expensive, beginning with design measures, the need for
surveillance and tracking, moving operational satellites out of harm's
way, and even replacing missions altogether. [For satellites in
geostationary orbit, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (oecd) reports that such [costs amount to]{.mark} an
estimated 5--10% of total mission costs, which could be [hundreds of
millions of dollars]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In low Earth orbits, the
relative costs per mission could be even higher than
5--10%.]{.underline}22 Increased costs would need to cover monitoring
costs, extra fuel for manoeuvres, the potential for shortened satellite
life, and use of safer but suboptimal orbital positions.23 

Overall, with space sustainability, several levels of threat to space
assets have to be distinguished. [The immediate threat is that a piece
of [debris could strike a satellite]{.mark} operating in orbit,
[rendering it **unusable**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[destroying the investment]{.underline}**]{.mark} of its operator.
[[This could lead to loss of revenues up to]{.mark} a potential
[bankruptcy]{.mark} of the company.]{.underline} [In the mid-term, [any
collision could trigger a chain reaction of debris]{.mark}
creation]{.underline}, potentially rendering certain orbits unusable
(so-called Kessler syndrome introduced in 197824 as highlighted by the
2013 movie Gravity. **[In the long-term [it could]{.mark} even [lead to
a loss of access to space]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Maintaining safe and
secure access to Earth's orbits is therefore essential to the projected
trillion-dollar space economy.

The idea of colonisation is associated with political realism,
territorial expansion, and implementation of own selfish interest by
national states. There are some historical examples that show that the
colonial powers not always have used military tools but sometimes they
have tried to do it by cooperation rather than conflict. In 1479 in
Alcáçovas has been signed the treaty between Portugal and Castile which
has stopped the war for succession after Henry IV of Castile. All
involved powers have accepted division of Atlantic Ocean and overseas
territories for two spheres to avoid possible competition and military
conflicts \[17\]; p. 194). Several years later, in 1494 the Treaty of
Tordesillas was signed which has divided the New World between Portugal
and Spain. This document has prevented conflict between these two states
\[17\]; pp. 199--202. [It is worth to consider another historical case
of cooperation between colonial states. We mean the case of China. Here
we find examples of interventions of the colonial powers against some
social movements and policy of the local authorities that have
questioned hegemony of European expansive states]{.underline}. Some of
these interventions have been made against rebellions and to defend the
authorities that were subordinated to the colonial powers, like the
imperial Chinese Manchurian Ts\'ing/Qing dynasty which has been
threatened by rebellions. One of such rebellions was Taiping Rebellion
(1851--1864), sometimes called revolution \[21\]; p. 375. It was caused
by concentration of the property by liege lords, increase of Chinese
population, and, consequently, shortage of land and pauperization of
citizens \[21\]; p. 375. This negative social situation was strengthened
by wrong effects of opium wars that were lost by China. During Taiping
Rebellion has been the second opium war in which British and French
armies had common operations. Another example of the great international
cooperation within colonialist politics is a coalition of eight powers
including seven European states and Japan to suppress the Boxer
Rebellion (the movement of I Ho Cz\'üan/T\'uan). This rebellion was
formed against foreign political domination in China \[21\]; pp.
512--523. The symbolic moment of this cooperation between European
states and Japan was the battle for Beijing in 1900, pictured in the
famous movie "55 days at Peking" in 1963. As noted Florian Wagner in
"Colonial Internationalism: How Cooperation Among Experts Reshaped
Colonialism (1830s--1950s)"\[36\], collaboration during colonisation was
maintained also in the framework of non-governmental international
research institutes. In 1893 the International Colonial Institute was
founded which included in 1914 above 200 members. Its purpose was
providing expertise, advice, and training in all colonies. The members
of this institute have worked in such fields as law, management, and
administration. They have prepared the set of good practice which were
used to efficiently manage overseas territories (Wagner). 5. [A peaceful
scenario of Mars colonising [The peaceful way of colonising of
Mars]{.mark} probably [will be characterized by]{.mark} many serious
t[hreats that can make colonisation plans impossible]{.mark} or at least
very difficult]{.underline}. [On the one side, it can be assumed that
the very likely scenario is [a repetition of conflict]{.mark} model that
was characteristic of the space race during the Cold War. On the other
side, [we can assume that tech]{.mark}nological, [economic]{.mark}, [and
social costs]{.mark} and challenges of the planned mission to Mars [will
be such high that only common effort of all leading countries in the
space policy could provide any success]{.mark}. It seems that the
successful preparation of the manned mission to Mars will require
collaboration between private and public companies.]{.underline} Such
collaboration can be threatened by the risk of attending to maximizing
benefits by both kinds of companies \[23\]. In this context, it is
difficult to predict the most likely scenario. Historical examples
provide ambivalent data. On the one side, it can be assumed that the US
will compete with Russia and with other countries that are involved in
the space policy, like China. The importance of China in the space
policy that is going to launch its own space station is getting higher.
Scenario of the new space cold war can be applied again. [NASA does not
agree for collaboration with China \[12\]. In the past, NASA wanted to
collaborate with the Soviet Union to prepare for the commonly manned
missions to Moon but the Soviet Union has rejected such proposal,
probably not to show its current technological advancement]{.underline}
\[12[\]. One of the possible obstacles for international collaboration
is a fear about disclosure is given technologies that could have
military application. Another one can be a great prestige of the pioneer
in Mars colonisation]{.underline}. However, this pioneering means not
only prestige and reputation but also an advantage in such cases like
property rights in a Martian colony, the legal status of the colony, or
possibility to dictate rules and standards for the next countries that
will try to send their manned missions to Mars \[30\]. [An argument for
the peaceful scenario of Mars colonising is the current international
collaboration on International Space Station and using only Russian
space crafts that are needed for American and nonAmerican astronauts
from other countries that cannot provide their own space
crafts]{.underline}. However, NASA is currently collaborating with
private American companies, like Space X. The recent using rocket Falcon
9 built by Space X to provide supply on ISS shows that collaboration
with private American partners can be reliable and effective alternative
for collaboration with foreign public companies. [[One of the
challenges]{.mark} for the future peaceful space policy will be the
discussion about the [legal status of the Martian
territories]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Treaty on Principles Governing the
Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space,
including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies" proclaimed in 1967 states
that no celestial body can be property and object of the power of any
country. Property rights work only in regard to sending objects and

difficult to provide great financial support for the current Mars
mission program, especially for reason of increasing challenges on the
Earth. It is worth remembering that financial reasons caused NASA to
give up the idea of the building constant base on Moon in 60 ts. and 70
ts. It was technologically possible, and societal and political context
(competition with the Soviet Union) also was favorable for such project.
However, high budgetary expenditure for war in Vietnam has stopped these
plans \[12\]. We suppose that the current political (no ideological,
symbolic war between countries) and economic situation (on the one side,
the risk of financial crisis, on the other side, multinational and
cross-national collaboration in finance and economy between the US,
Russia or China) will lead to peaceful international collaboration also
in space policy. [We suppose that the greatest obstacle for such
collaboration can be unwillingness to share own knowledge about the
technological and scientific advance, and tendency to achieve priority
to take an advantage over competitors in the new space
race.]{.underline}

Intelligence Council\'s projections, significant changes to the global
political and economic trends should be expected to take place by 2025.
The dominant role of the western model of democracy and liberal economy
may come to an end, which will cause the international environment to
transform from a unipolar model into a multipolar one, characteristic of
the second half of the 19th Century \[5\]. Taking into account the above

2050]{.underline}**, if the natural resources continue to be exploited
at the present speed, the humanity will have to colonise not one but two
planets within the nearest 50 years \[32\]. [What will the]{.underline}
**[future battle of Mars be like?]{.underline}** In order to take a
closer look at the potential conflict to break out at the turn of the
21st and 22nd centuries, it may seem useful to refer to the division of
warfare generations developed by William Lind in 1989. In the article
entitled. The Changing Face of War: Into the Fourth Generation,
published in "Marine Corp Gazette," he proposed dividing warfare into
four generations. The first generation of military conflicts, which ran
roughly from 1648 to 1860, was characterized with the general
mobilisation of soldiers, line or column tactics, and the monopoly on
aggression established by the state. Second generation war concerned
such conflicts as the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. It brought new types
of armour, , such as machine guns. Line tactics was the prevailing form
of fighting, but the significance of the human factor was reduced by
firepower. First World War and Second World War constituted examples of
third generation warfare, based on speed and manoeuvre skills
(Blitzkrieg). Tanks and aircraft were symbols of front-line fights,
entailing a shift from line into manoeuvre tactics. Fourth generation
war differed considerably from the previously described types of
warfare. The parties at war no longer sought to fight one or several
major battles in an attempt to dissolve the conflict, but they became
increasingly more common to engage the entire society in fights, which
hindered the division into civilians and military men. There were no
longer mass armies, but the armed forces were professionalised,
comprising mobile troops limited in numbers. The warfare purpose was no
longer to eliminate the enemy in physical terms but to internally
shatter the opposing country \[Lind 1989\]; p. 23). Since the
development of the fourth generation war concept, increasingly more
investigators sought to propose further generations of warfare, taking
into consideration the course of the most recent conflicts, along with
the growing importance of technologies and space. An attempt at
describing the future military conflicts, based on William Lind\'s
classification, has been made, inter alia, by Major I-r Minhas from the
Pakistan Army, in the article entitled Defining Concepts of 5th
Generation Warfare. According to Minhas, fifth generation war will be
similar to fourth generation war. Further decountrifying of warfare
should be expected, coupled with the growing role of private military
companies, cyber war and information war, as well as war involving the
use of non-lethal weapons. On the other hand, the technological
revolution will be dominated by biological inventions. Food control and
food safety will gain in importance \[18\]. By means of the High -
Frequency Active Aurora Research Program (HAARP) technology, states will
be able to influence weather disturbances (earthquakes, cyclones or
tsunami), or to destroy military satellites and aerodynamic missiles. An
attempt to characterising the fifth generation war has also been made by
Lieutenant Colonel Stanton S. Coerrer from the United States Marine
Corps. In his work, entitled Fifth-Generation War: Warfare versus the
nonstate, he claimed that future conflicts would combine different
military operations. On the one hand, western countries, including in
particular the United States, will seek to make their warfare come to a
quick end, through one or a few battles leading to the physical
elimination of their enemy (or its leaders, as was the case with Osama
bin Laden). On the other hand, the widely-understood nonstate armed
groups (i.e. terrorist groups, criminal organisations or failed states)
will stick to ideologies uniting their supporters (e.g. Islam), aiming
at the maximum prolongation of the conflict and making it impossible for
western countries to secure a quick tactic victory \[26\]; pp. 64--65).1
Referring to William Lind\'s war generation concept, it should be
stressed that there is no defined length of time, following which a new
type of warfare is expected to emerge. The time span between the
emergence of first generation war (1648) and second generation war
(1870) was 222 years, while no more than 70 years passed between the
second and third generation (1940). Assuming that Mars will be colonised
at the turn of the 21st and 22nd centuries, and radical shifts in
war-fighting will occur with an average frequency of 100 years, the
humanity is yet to face the fifth, sixth and possibly seventh generation
of warfare. Although the issues of space militarisation and the
construction of space weapons have been dealt with in literature on the
subject matter \[24\], any presentations of the conflict that may arise
in several dozen (or hundred) years\' time should be treated as science
fiction research. Nonetheless, as pointed out by Łukasz Kamieński in his
book Nowy wspaniały żołnierz \[New great soldier\], quality science
fiction entails creating future scenarios that extrapolate the presence.
It should contain visions based on the logical inferences drawn from
diversified processes, scientific discoveries and technologies,
currently observed in their initial forms, mainly through scientific
studies and technological development, along with the dynamics of
social, political and economic changes \[13\]. Contrary to fourth and
fifth generation warfare, space wars will be dominated by nation states
and international corporations. Elon Musk, Managing Director of SpaceX,
a company dealing with the manufacture of jet engines, carrier rockets,
and spaceships, claimed that within the nearest 40--100 years over 1
million people might be sent to Mars. He estimated the cost of one
person\'s reaching the Red Planet at USD 200 million \[16\]. According
to the authors of the Mars one initiative, a sum of USD 6 billion will
be needed to send the first four astronauts to Mars \[6\]. The need to
secure such exorbitant funds virtually excludes any entities other than
states and international corporations (terrorist groups, criminal
organisations or failed states) from participating in space wars. It
should be expected that the future space wars will entail an advanced
process of conflict robotisation and dehumanisation. The prospective
Mars colonisation war may proceed by means of robots -- unmanned aerial
vehicles. Ender\'s Game, an American science fiction film dating back to
2013, based on a novel by Orson Scott Card published under the same
title, features scenes presenting such kind of a conflict. The film is
set in 2070. The main hero, ten-year-old Andrew Wiggin, is elected
leader of the invading fleet, intended to destroy the native world of a
foreign life form threatening the Earth. Andrew Wiggin, believing that
he is taking part in training, leads the invading fleet and defeats the
enemy. The invading forces comprise only unmanned space drones
controlled from a secure place \[11\]. The progressing robotisation and
dehumanisation of war will also be influenced by the strategic culture
of western countries (the United States) whose societies show limited
tolerance to human loss during military conflicts. As stressed by Adrian
Lewis in his book The American Culture of War, abolishing the obligatory
military service was the most significant change introduced in the 20th
century to the U.S. war-fighting model. It triggered the
professionalization of armed forces, with a mass army being replaced by
mobile troops limited in numbers \[14\]. Along with the robotisation and
dehumanisation, the future space wars should also be expected to be
brief. Unless the dispute escalating between the global powers evolves
into military activities located in the Earth, the conflict may end soon
after the communication satellites of one of the parties are destroyed,
or its space station is damaged. Considering the above, the
technological arms race between the competing States, aimed at
designing, as fast as possible, a weapon which will enable defeating the
enemy in the first attack, without any possibility of retaliation, will
prove crucial. The upcoming space confrontation will also encourage the
parties concerned to develop a new military doctrine. Similar
circumstances occurred in the 1970s when the concept of AirLand Battle
was created, in order to prepare the NATO forces to confront the
military forces of the Warsaw Pact \[25\], and also in 2010 when the
concept of an AirSea Battle was designed, presenting the possible
scenario of the American and Chinese confrontation in Western Pacific
\[34\]. At the turn of the 21st and 22nd centuries, a space battle
concept is likely to emerge. Taking into account the content of the
existing military doctrines, it will also comprise such elements as the
type and examples of space weapons, and other technologies, together
with the warfare character and the possible battle scenario. Although we
are still very far from the potential space battle, first studies on the
prospective space warfare technologies have already been developed. Bob
Preston et al. in the publication entitled Space Weapons Earth Wars,
made a division of space weapons into [**[Directed-Energy
Weapons]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Mass to Target
Weapons]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The examples they quoted [include
a]{.underline} **[laser]{.underline}** for missile target, [the use
of]{.underline} **[meteorites]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[[destroy earth targets]{.underline}]{.mark}** or a miniature
autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle, also serving the purpose of
destroying earth targets \[19\]. A vision of the future space battle has
also been presented in a documentary entitled Space Wars. Among
technologies that may be key to the victory of one of the parties, its
authors indicated a laser weapon as the fastest light missile and
[a]{.underline} **[railgun]{.underline}** [whose speed may be several
times higher than the speed of a missile fired from the currently used
conventional weapons]{.underline} \[3\]. 7. Conclusion The purpose of
this article was to present two scenarios of colonising Mars. At
present, it is hard to project whether this will be a peaceful
colonisation or a military conflict between the countries engaged in the
race. This actually depends on a number of factors, including the trends
prevailing at the turn of the 21st and 22nd centuries international
relations (realism vs. liberal institutionism), the state of
international public law, the amount of natural resources in Earth, the
functioning of international organisations (the UN or a new organisation
dealing with space exploration) and the role of authorities (i.e. units
influencing the international opinion due to their acquis or individual
contribution to space conquest). A peaceful colonisation of Mars, based
on joint ventures, i.e. the construction of new orbital stations,
cooperation between astronauts and space exploration, certainly seems
the most desirable scenario. The worst version, on the other hand, is
the [**[military conflict]{.underline}** [triggered
by]{.underline}]{.mark} [the need to [search for natural
resources]{.mark} or resulting from a]{.underline} **[new cold
war]{.underline}** [that may break out]{.underline} between the United
States, the Russian Federation, the People\'s Republic of China, and
possibly other new powers, e.g. Brazil and India. [One may not rule out

Floating time bombs

Seeking to circumvent sanctions on its oil exports, Russia has already
begun building a "shadow fleet" of decrepit old tankers with unknown
owners that flout all established maritime rules. Sweden and Denmark
have voiced concerns about the danger of major environmental disasters
as these uninsured and poorly maintained single-hull tankers move along
their coasts. Ships from this sizable fleet have been tracked moving
into the Arctic.

Buyers with suspected ties to Russia have now also begun acquiring old
tankers for the transport of LNG. Allowing such ships, which lack any
meaningful protection against sea ice, to become part of Arctic shipping
poses a looming threat of environmental damage.

A tighter alliance between Russia, China and India that is based on the
latter two exploiting Russia as a secure source of cheap energy will
have negative implications for security beyond the Arctic.

Likely: Increase in 'shadow fleets'

An alliance between these three powers will also produce a mounting
threat to global maritime rules and regulations.

Russia's vision of expanding its fleet of icebreakers and ice-class
vessels ran into trouble already in 2022 when Finnish companies exited
the project. More recently, South Korea has also either canceled or put
on hold a planned delivery of six LNG tankers to Novatek. The
consequence is a rapid growth in the "shadow fleet" of tankers.

Shadow fleet ships flout the demands for insurance and safety
inspections and avoid detection by sailing with their transponders
turned off. They make port only in the three partnering countries, and
as China and India show little interest in investing in the fleet's
safety, a likely corollary outcome is that shipowners in other countries
will also engage in lucrative trade with such vessels. Major sea
accidents are bound to occur.

The [IAEA Assessment of **Iran's Nuke Program**]{.underline}

Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, discussed the state of Iran's nuclear program on Sunday
on CBS News' Face the Nation; the interview was taped Friday:

I think you can pick and choose any adjective to characterize this, but
you will see that [[there is an **agreement**]{.mark} in describing this
as a very serious level of damage]{.underline}. It can be, you know,
described in different ways, but [it's clear [that]{.mark} what happened
in particular in Fordo, Natanz, Isfahan]{.underline}, where
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} used to have and still has, to some degree,
[[capabilities in]{.mark} terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment
of [**uranium** have been **destroyed**]{.mark}]{.underline} to an
important degree. Some is still standing. So there is, of course, an
important setback in terms of those --- of those capabilities. This is
--- this is clear. And now the important issue --- the important thing
is, what are the next steps? Now the characterization of the damage, I
think we can, you know, speculate, and still, until, of course, the
Iranians themselves will have to go there and sift through the, you
know, rubble and look at what is the exact degree of the damage. At some
point, the IAEA will have to return. Although our job is not to assess
damage, but to re-establish the knowledge of the activities that take
place there, and the access to the material, which is very, very
important, the material that they will be producing if they continue
with this activity. This is contingent on other, you see, everything is
connected. This is --- this is contingent on negotiations which may or
may not restart, so --- so what we see this here, I think we have a
snapshot of- of- of a program which has been very seriously damaged, to
quote Dr. Araghchi. And now what we need to focus on is on the next
steps. \[Emphasis added.\]

"Dr. Araghchi" is Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister:

[Iran's foreign minister]{.underline}, Abbas Araghchi, [said on Thursday
that the country's nuclear facilities had sustained "significant and
serious damages,"]{.underline} the first official acknowledgment of the
extent of the damages caused by U.S. strikes on three nuclear sites.

The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran was still "surveilling the
damages and losses," Mr. Araghchi said in an interview with Iran's state
television. But, he added, "I have to say, [the losses have not been
small, and our [facilities have been **seriously
damaged**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Is Iran's nuclear weapons program so destroyed that we never have to
worry about it again? No. Iran has more than 90 million people, two
uranium mines, and depending upon how you measure, either the 25th or
the 37th-largest economy in the world. [If they pour **all their
resources** into developing a nuclear weapon, they can regain lost
ground.]{.underline} Of course, [[developing a]{.mark} nuclear [weapon
in **secret** is **difficult**, and the U.S.]{.mark} has demonstrated it
[can **blow up whatever**]{.mark} the Iranians attempt to
build.]{.underline}

Strategy, 2022 National Defense Strategy, and 2022 National Strategy for
the Arctic Region, among others, all point to the strategic significance
of the Arctic and the US commitment to safeguarding its national
interests in the region. This Special Report focuses on maritime domain
awareness (MDA) as one crucial aspect of Arctic security. [[The need for
Arctic MDA is pressing]{.underline}]{.mark}, given increased shipping,
tourism, and fishing in the region, as well as increased security
threats -- specifically from China and Russia. This Special Report
suggests that [[while MDA tools such as satellites, AI, and other

In situ and fieldwork. [[In situ research is critical to accurately
upscaling projected changes to permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}
ecosystems116--118, by providing the data continuity needed [[to
understand the **local** dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark} of permafrost
thaw. Analyses of gradual thaw have now spanned multiple decades,
documenting the release and uptake of carbon at the site to landscape
scales, often using rivers or lakes as landscape integrators119. For
example, one of the longest in situ assessments of carbon exchange in
Alaskan tundra and rivers systems identified a local increase in carbon
emission and uptake over the last 15 years, with a net carbon loss of
781.6gCm−2 (refs120,121). This increase suggests that, although Arctic
vegetation increases could lead to higher carbon uptake7,122, an
increase in respiration could offset these gains.

[[In situ monitoring is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[necessary in
identifying soil-level changes that are]{.underline}]{.mark} difficult
or [[impossible to monitor using remote sensing]{.underline}]{.mark}
tools. For example, in situ soil temperature profile measurements have
shown that active layer zones at 20--30-cm depths in tundra wetlands
remain thawed, but hovering near 0°C for months into the cold season.
This so-called zero curtain period extends microbial metabolism and both
CO2 and CH4 emissions well past the point when the surface has
refrozen12,14,87. The shoulder season period currently contributes an
estimated \~50% of annual permafrost wetland CH4 emissions14,87.
Similarly, a synthesis of northern thermokarst lake emissions suggested
that Arctic lakes and ponds could increase CH4 release 20--54% before
2100, as warm seasons lengthen with climate change74.

Year-over-year permafrost changes are more visible where thaw meets
physical erosion, [[making **fieldwork** especially
valuable]{.underline}]{.mark}. In an Alaskan riverbank, for example,
retrieved data covering 1995--2011 illustrates permafrost retreat of
\~11m per year (880 tons of C)123. As permafrost thaw increases
hydrologic change, these dynamics might be mirrored across increasingly
large areas. While in situ data are not immediately able to be upscaled,
long-term [[laboratory and field research provide invaluable
information]{.underline}]{.mark} on permafrost loss and carbon
transformation, especially in combination with remote sensing tools.

**Modeling limits overwhelm monitoring data**

Improve understanding of vegetation and carbon dynamics. [[Arctic
greening is projected to offset at least a portion of permafrost carbon
release]{.underline}]{.mark} through biomass formation and the
incorporation of plant detritus in soils7,163. Under the RCP4.5
scenario, [[gradual thaw]{.underline}]{.mark} model [[simulations
suggest that vegetative carbon storage could
increase]{.underline}]{.mark} from 156 to 954TgC per year by 2100,
offsetting permafrost carbon emissions7 .

Large-scale ESMs must be diverse enough to capture both large variation
in simulated Arctic CO2 plant uptake7,89,146,147 and ecosystem carbon
balance often dictated by the strength of plant CO2 fertilization in
combination with vegetation response to climate7,172. For example,
permafrost thaw lakes could serve an essential carbon sequestration
function, with vegetation and sediment storing up to 47 ±10 gC m−2 per
year173. However, thermokarst lake sequestration relies on permafrost
stability, the loss of which leads to drainage and the release of
carbon173. A better understanding of how to incorporate carbon release
with abrupt thaw into ESMs, plus a more realistic simulation of changing
plant distributions and uptake potential, represent important topics for
future research concerning both gradual and abrupt thaw.

Understand palaeo-permafrost for insight into future change. [[Little is
known about how]{.underline}]{.mark} the modern [[destabilization of
permafrost compares with past periods of abrupt climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}. Permafrost thaw rates were rapid during the
early Holocene, at least for thermokarst lakes173, but probably occurred
under a lower temperature threshold than they do now, as the rapid
warming of the past 100 years outpaces much of the Holocene. Similarly,
a punctuated pulse of permafrost carbon released to the atmosphere at
the end of the Last Glacial Maximum might have driven the global
temperature increase recorded at the start of the interglacial174,175.
Research incorporating extremophiles preserved in permafrost, carbon
dating and nutrient characterization should be prioritized as permafrost
microbes increasingly enter the modern ecosystem.

Improve data scaling. Losses of old carbon through permafrost thaw,
particularly via abrupt thaw features such as thermokarst lakes, are
typically described and upscaled as hotspots176. [[Future research
should]{.underline}]{.mark} focus on the point-source and atmosphere
flux data required to [[frame permafrost thaw]{.underline}]{.mark}
carbon emissions [[within an ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark} control
point [[framework]{.underline}]{.mark}177, which will lead to a more
robust mechanistic understanding of permafrost biogeochemistry and
improved ability to scale and simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of
the PCF. [[Coordination across]{.underline}]{.mark} field, airborne and
remote sensing [[campaigns is essential to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
success of [[observing]{.underline}]{.mark} carbon emissions across
scales, [[enabling better predictions for the future of the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Non-Arctic observer states in the Arctic Council can make a certain

[[Infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}---from ports and airfields to
roads and broadband communications to hospitals and schools---
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} often cited as [[a key problem in the Arctic.
Parts]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Arctic, especially [[in northern
Europe, are well outfitted]{.underline}]{.mark} in terms of many types
of infrastructure. However, [[this is not the norm across the region
writ large]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is a key reason national
governments and commercial entities have limited presence in the Arctic
and local communities can be self-reliant and practice resilience.

From the perspective of the U.S. armed forces, [[much infrastructure is
needed, but most crucial are four specific types]{.underline}]{.mark}
that consistently limit U.S. reach and persistence in the Arctic:

• [[First]{.underline}]{.mark}, capturing or transporting, [[storing,
and distributing energy is essential for any
operation]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially when there are typically long
distances involved and a vital need for heat and breaking ice. Fuel and
energy infrastructure can be very spartan even where it exists in the
Far North. The armed forces are constrained in where they can go and how
long getting to those destinations will take without robust energy
logistics, which include the need for specialized fuels, batteries, and
other types of energy and storage that can withstand very low
temperatures and a dynamic environment.

• [[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}, there is little [[infrastructure to
support maintenance]{.underline}]{.mark}, which includes prepositioned
structures, personnel, parts, and other equipment to conduct
maintenance, as well as an ability to move equipment and tools into
proximity as needed. This means that, if an asset is damaged, parts
unexpectedly break down, or an asset needs routine maintenance, it must
be transported to lower latitudes or an agreement with a partner country
must be negotiated if there is even an ability to conduct maintenance in
a partner's facility.

• [[Third, the United States does not have a robust ability to support
temporary infrastructure through a lily-pad model]{.underline}]{.mark}
(e.g., building some basic infrastructure, such as pads with power and
water hookups ready to go in multiple locations rather than permanent
locations that are difficult to build and maintain and might not be best
positioned for future utilization).

• [[Finally, many parts of the Arctic have very limited medical
facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, and facilities that do exist are rarely
large and able to support mass casualties or specialized procedures.
This means that any personnel with physical or mental health issues
generally need to be transported to lower latitudes for care. Even
emergency medical supplies that could be provisioned might not be viable
under Arctic conditions. For example, frozen blood is not terribly
useful for emergency transfusions.

[[C2 in the Arctic theater becomes yet more challenging when
**coordinating** with allies and partners]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
coming months will be critical in devising a strategic path forward when
it comes to integrating command plans across the US joint force, NORAD,
and NATO. [[NATO's Northern enlargement and SinoRussian **alignment
alter the Arctic security map**]{.underline}]{.mark} for the United
States, which requires military planners to think anew about a stronger
"Arctic dimension" within NATO. This could include consideration of a US
or joint forward operating base in the European or North American
Arctic. These questions will need to be carefully considered by NATO as
it adjusts its posture to align with the new regional defense plans.
[[The new]{.underline}]{.mark} Nordic and [[Arctic 7

[[**Navigation issues** in the Arctic could also lead to]{.mark}
**military [escalations]{.mark}** reaching the **nuclear
level**]{.underline}. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),
which includes satellite constellations like the American GPS system or
Russian GLONASS, sees decreased reliability and accuracy in the Arctic.
The reasons for this are abundant, like the orbital inclination of the
satellites themselves and ionospheric interference. With increased
incidents of Russian GNSS jamming in Europe, [it's conceivable that
[Russia may **employ**]{.mark} **similar [tactics in the
Arctic]{.mark}**, [including spoofing, for the purpose of]{.mark}
disruption or [causing navigational errors to trigger an exploitable
international incident]{.mark}. Military or civilian [vessels straying
into Russian territory could be captured]{.mark}, their cargoes seized,
[or crews held hostage]{.mark} for the purpose of conducting hostage
diplomacy. Resolving [such a confrontation]{.mark} military [could
**quickly spiral out of control**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Yet considering these combined factors, the Arctic does not exist in a
vacuum, and there are other regions in which nuclear tensions are
rising.

The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is the most likely scenario
for a direct confrontation between the United States and another nuclear
power. Though he has not signaled any specific intent to attack,
President Xi aims for the Chinese military to be capable of invading
Taiwan by 2027. While President Biden indicated his intention to
directly aid Taiwan if this occurred, President Trump appears to defer
to the traditional American position of strategic ambiguity over the
island. Should China decide to invade, and the U.S. responds to defend
Taiwan, it is difficult to see Washington opting to detonate a nuclear
weapon over an issue that does not directly threaten the U.S. mainland
or a NATO ally. On the other hand, a subsequent attack on Chinese
mainland military sites in order to disable an attacking Chinese
invasion force could plausibly incite a nuclear response.

What is most concerning is that [[provocative military behavior]{.mark}
anywhere could [lead to an **unintentional cycle of escalation** that
ultimately results in]{.mark} a [**nuclear exchange**. As the Arctic
opens to more]{.mark} **military and commercial [activity]{.mark}**[,
the **frequency of encounters**]{.mark} between military forces is
likely to **[increase]{.mark}**. As those encounters increase, [so too
does the **probability** that an accident or]{.mark} unintended
**[attack]{.mark}** may [occur]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Russia routinely
flies patrols into the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone, an area
of international air space in which the U.S. identifies all aircraft,
aggressive behavior by Russian pilots raises the risk of a routine
encounter evolving into an international incident. But these aggressive
incidents are much more frequent elsewhere, like the Baltic and North
Seas. For example, in 2022, a Russian SU-27 fighter jet fired two
missiles against a British RC-135 surveillance jet over the Black Sea,
but fortunately neither missile hit their target. Similarly, China is
known for conducting frequent unsafe intercepts of foreign aircraft in
the East and South China Seas.

[[Satellite monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark} first came into use during
the Cold War with predictions that Sputnik and subsequent developments
"would fundamentally change the pattern of intelligence investment"
(Gioe, Goodman, and Stevens 2020, 201). With the mid-20 th century
advent of solid-state electronics, the US and USSR could, for the first
time, surveil their rivals from the safety of outer space (201). Space
assets continue to make up vital components of the Arctic monitoring
regime. Canada's RADARSAT-II is one of NORAD's primary permanent sources
of Arctic intelligence, [[offering a nearly constant feed of information
on Russian behavior]{.underline}]{.mark} (Atland 2014, 155). Likewise,
US space assets controlled from bases in Alaska and Greenland
periodically survey the region (US Department of Defense 2019, 15), with
imaging passes estimated to be made over the Far North once every thirty
minutes (Bamford 2015).

As technological advances and interest in outer space continue to
expand, state satellite capabilities [[will only grow further. The US
military is exploring how innovations like over-the-horizon
radar]{.underline}]{.mark}, technologies capable of detecting objects
[[at much longer ranges]{.underline}]{.mark}, could be [[coupled
with]{.underline}]{.mark} organizational developments like the [[Space
Force]{.underline}]{.mark} to open doors for [[Arctic domain

System (AIS) capable of surveilling the country's entire coast (The

rescue, and in "exercise of sovereignty" (32). This [[growth of

(jamming)]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities to counter incursions from
the US and its allies. Norway and Finland are reporting [[frequent

[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} also prove to [[be a game changer. This
will emplace a more capable key maritime logistics]{.underline}]{.mark}
node in the U.S. Arctic. With Washington and Maine being the
northernmost states on either coast within the contiguous United States,
[[a deepwater port]{.underline}]{.mark} in northern Alaska [[would be a
substantial improvement in the timeliness of access to the Bering,
Chukchi, and Beaufort Sea areas]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Arctic. This
being noted, there are important local community and environmental
considerations related to port expansion. The high volume of silt from
the Snake River means that deepwater-draft vessel access to the port
will need to be monitored and managed on a regular basis, perhaps via
periodic dredging.

[[The deepwater port]{.underline}]{.mark} at Nome would also positively
affect logistics but [[is **only one** piece]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Numerous experts articulated concerns about fuel, maintenance, and
medical logistics in particular. [[Given the
vastness]{.underline}]{.mark} of distance [[and general lack of
infrastructure in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, operators are always
concerned about when and how to refuel, especially if the scale of
operations might expand.

Lack of infrastructure and vast distances also affect maintenance and
medical logistics. At present, [[the armed forces must return to lower
latitudes in the event of anything beyond]{.underline}]{.mark} very
[[minor maintenance]{.underline}]{.mark} or medical issues (or, in the
case of the latter, potentially facilitate transport for the affected
people). Once again, this is not an adequate solution if scaling up
presence is the aim.

In addition to new capabilities at Nome, the United States can consider
the possibility of making more use of naval facilities along the New
England coast. This is also a case in which partnering can be useful,
such as when Canada completes refurbishing the Nanisivik Naval Facility
in Nunavut. Additional work on mobile technical capabilities and tactics
should also be investigated. Logistics on the Atlantic side of
continental North America are particularly important for increasing
responsiveness and on-station time in the European Arctic.

Finally, [[there could be opportunities for making investments in
"low-hanging fruit" for domain awareness and
communications]{.underline}]{.mark}. This could involve carefully
reviewing the design of new cutters and considering what missions these
might conduct that might require specialized equipment, [[such as
undersea monitoring equipment]{.underline}]{.mark} to support the
defense readiness mission. This could also involve working with joint
partners to determine whether the USCG and other DHS components, as
needed, can take advantage of existing contracts or plans to buy
equipment and services that could help limit the cost for DHS.

Second, [[Russia will be in no shape to launch new wars of
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} when the war [[in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} is finally over. U.S. intelligence believes
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[lost more than
300,000]{.underline}]{.mark} troops killed or wounded in Ukraine,
[[along with]{.underline}]{.mark} thousands of armored
[[vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark} and dozens of [[ships and aircraft.
Putin has been reluctant to order additional troop
mobilizations]{.underline}]{.mark} (though he may do so now that his
"reelection" is over), both [[because such measures will weaken the
Russian economy]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
risk [[fuel]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[popular
discontent]{.underline}]{.mark}. Western sanctions have not hurt the
Russian economy as much as the United States and its allies hoped, but
the long-term economic consequences for Russia are still going to be
severe. Fighting a long conventional war is costly, and starting another
one whenever the current one ends would be even more foolhardy than
Putin's original decision to launch what he believed would be an easy
"special military operation." Isn't it just as likely that Russia's
difficulties in Ukraine will make Putin far more cautious in the future,
even if his army eventually ekes out a Pyrrhic victory?

Third, if the main reason that Putin decided to invade was to prevent
Ukraine from moving into the West's orbit and someday joining NATO, then
he might be satisfied if that possibility is foreclosed in a subsequent
peace agreement. States often go to war out of fear rather than greed,
and if Russia's security fears diminish, its incentive to go after other
countries in Europe would presumably decline as well. NATO's members
should not take this possibility for granted, of course, but it is as
plausible as the assumption that Putin's aims have no limit.

[[strategic arms control]{.underline}]{.mark} and establishing new
multilateral formats for non-strategic nuclear arms control will
necessarily constitute a key part of the post-war European re-engagement
with Russia.54 Remarkably, [[there is also a strong pushback in Moscow's
expert community against]{.underline}]{.mark} the irresponsible idea of
[[bringing back the nuclear "fear factor"]{.underline}]{.mark} by
delivering a nuclear strike on, for example, Poznan.55 [[These sober
arguments may find support]{.underline}]{.mark} not only among the
risk-averse political elites but also [[among the top

army]{.underline}]{.mark} in its present shape [[cannot possibly engage
in combat operations on a nuclear battlefield]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet,
President Putin rejected resolutely and rudely the prospect of reducing
Russia's nuclear arsenal, and, while such vulgarity may be a feature of
his war-affected personal style of doing business, for every grouping of
elites that might find a way to depose him, the proposition of giving up
Russia's vast advantage in numbers of non-strategic nuclear warheads
would appear singularly unattractive.56 To alter this nuclearcentric,
even nuclear-worshipping attitude, key [[European states might find it
useful to return]{.underline}]{.mark} in the post-war environment

was [raised](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-03/beware-guns-august-asia?utm_medium=social) recently
by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of Australia. **[Noting the many

there is a growing danger of them "stumbling into
conflict."]{.underline}** An accidental collision between ships or
planes in the South China Sea, or several other plausible scenarios,
could lead to crisis, escalation and war. **[Just as the great powers of

of an unwanted war]{.underline}**: a devastating conflict that none of

During the Cold War, U.S. policymakers worried that crises over Berlin
or Cuba could get out of control. There is a body

**[Yet]{.underline}** there is one big problem: **[[It is hard to

moreover, that if war had to come, better it should come sooner rather
than later.]{.underline}**

A generation after that, **[Franklin Roosevelt may not have foreseen
that slapping an oil embargo on Japan would lead to the aerial assault
on Pearl Harbor. But he certainly understood that war was a distinct
possibility]{.underline}** **[once the U.S. began strangling the economy
of a country that was already pillaging Asia.]{.underline}**

**[Likewise, the Six Day sWar]{.underline}** of 1967 **[is

an **[inadvertent]{.underline}** conflict. **[But again, Egyptian

war when they mobilized forces in the Sinai Peninsula, blockaded
Israel's port on the Red Sea and took other belligerent
steps. ]{.underline}**

The reality, as the historian Marc Trachtenberg
has [shown](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/trachtenberg/cv/inadvertent.pdf),
is that **[countries tend to avoid war when neither really desires it.
Yes, leaders do sometimes misjudge]{.underline}** how wars will turn out
and how destructive they will be. **[Tensions can gradually ratchet up
in a way that makes de-escalation progressively harder.]{.underline}**

**[Yet [there is no more monumental decision than]{.mark} to initiate a
[major conflict. So when countries really]{.mark} do [want to
avert]{.mark} a [showdown]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} are generally willing
to [tack or retreat]{.mark}, even at the cost of some
embarrassment. ]{.underline}**

**[[During the Cold War]{.mark}, there was plenty of superpower
brinkmanship]{.underline}**, and some hair-raising incidents involving
U.S. and Soviet military forces. There
were [several](https://www.amazon.com/We-Now-Know-Rethinking-Relations/dp/0198780710) near

**[Accidental war also seems unlikely today]{.underline}**. **[There are

[As the world warms, we will begin to approach **tipping points**,
large-scale climate discontinuities that could lead to major increases
in total warming]{.underline} (Lenton et al. 2019). [Could tipping
points put us on an irreversible course towards existential
catastrophe]{.underline} by 2100?

The first thing to say is that, as with the paleoclimate, [[tipping
points need to be **contextualized** within]{.mark} our understanding of
[specific mechanisms]{.mark}, such as [**sea level rise**, **heat
stress**]{.mark} and **[crop failure]{.mark}**, by which climate change
could lead to existential catastrophe. We have seen that [even the most
**outlandish warming scenarios do not pose a credible threat of
existential catastrophe** through any of these]{.mark}
mechanisms]{.underline}. So [[even]{.mark} if tipping points raise [the
probability of **extreme warming**]{.mark}, it is [not]{.mark} clear
that they [provide a]{.mark} **new and [credible pathway towards
existential catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

More to the point, Halstead reviews each of the proposed tipping points
in the diagram above and argues in detail that [[no]{.mark}ne of these
[tipping point]{.mark}s [presents a **credible threat**]{.mark} of human
extinction]{.underline}. I will review a few representative examples
below. (Interested readers are invited to consult Chapter 8 of the
Halstead report).

Begin with [[dieback of the Amazon **rainforest**]{.mark} in the tropics
[and **boreal forests** near the arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both
forests play an important role in trapping carbon, preventing it from
reaching the atmosphere.

Halstead suggests (plausibly) that [boreal forest dieback is likely to
be something of **[a wash]{.mark}**. As the world warms, the
southernmost reaches of boreal forests will become too warm to support
existing forests. But at the same time, boreal forests will expand
northwards into land that was previously too cold to support them. For
this reason, boreal [forest dieback is **not expected to pose a
significant existential threat**]{.mark} anytime soon]{.underline}.

Amazon rainforest dieback is a bit more concerning. Indeed, Halstead
suggests, there is a good chance that human-caused deforestation will
continue to devastate the Amazon rainforest alongside the destruction
caused by climate change. However, Halstead reminds us, most tropical
forests fluorished during the Eocene period, in which periods were more
than 10°C hotter than they are today. So there is no ready inference
from present-day warming to a catastrophic collapse of the Amazon
rainforest.

As Halstead reminds us, the IPCC's latest assessment report estimates
that even on pessimistic warming scenarios (4°C warming combined with
some pessimistic modeling assumptions), Amazon dieback is expected to
contribute about 0.3°C of additional warming. A catastrophe? Yes. But an
existential catastrophe? Certainly not.

[What about [arctic permafrost]{.mark}?]{.underline} A great deal of
carbon is currently trapped in the arctic permafrost, and as the world
warms, permafrost will gradually melt, releasing carbon into the
atmosphere. At Halstead reminds us, the IPCC currently projects that
each 1°C of warming will lead to 18 gigatons of carbon (GtC) released
from arctic permafrost. That is roughly two percent of the amount
projected to be released by 2100 on a middle-of-the-road scenario (RCP
4.5) by the IPCC. As before, [this [is a **regrettable catastrophe, but
hardly an existential threat**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, the fragmentation of circumpolar cooperation is closing doors
on diplomatic activity that could help to diffuse tensions and promote
confidence-building measures. Prior to 2022, there was some discussion
of re-establishing joint military forums or some form of 'code of
conduct', but this dissipated quickly as Moscow's designs on Ukraine
became clear. The chances of a predictable Arctic in military security
terms are growing slimmer.

The [[risk of]{.mark} an armed [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Arctic is clearly higher than it was. However, [this [does not
mean]{.mark} that either [NATO or Moscow is]{.mark} any more [likely to
seek a conflict]{.mark} in the Arctic than they were prior to Russia's
assault on]{.underline} Ukraine. [[Considering the complexity]{.mark} of
the operating environment, [there is little incentive]{.mark} for Moscow
-- or NATO -- [to escalate]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic per se,
let alone conduct high-intensity warfare operations there.

For now, [the most likely scenario is that [we will continue to see a
balancing and counterbalancing]{.mark} of NATO and Russian forces in the
High North as both sides adjust to the realities]{.underline} of Swedish
and Finnish membership of NATO

[[There is no sign]{.mark} yet]{.underline} (publicly at least) [that
[either side is seeking to change]{.mark} the '[facts on the
ground']{.mark} regarding critical international
agreements]{.underline}, or even press claims in areas of disagreement
-- for instance, over how to interpret the Svalbard Treaty on the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as it applies to the Northeast
Passage ([[including the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
NSR) and the delimitation of extended continental shelves.

Nevertheless, Russia remains determined to control 'its' Arctic and the
NSR. Over the past few years, successive waves of regulations have
increasingly restricted passage through the NSR, placing it under
Moscow's tight control. If, even as the effects of climate change are
felt, Russia maintains its dubious interpretation of the status of the
NSR, or if the Kremlin seeks to further restrict passage along the route
(especially for foreign military vessels), there could be more serious
consideration of a US- or NATO-led Freedom of Navigation operation, even
if it increases the risk of an armed clash.

These issues are all the more critical in the context of the renewed US
interest in Arctic affairs as part of the 2022 National Strategy for the
Arctic Region (NSAR) and its 2023 Implementation Plan. Indeed, the NSAR
is quite clear regarding protecting freedom of navigation across the
Arctic region in accordance with UNCLOS.

For now, the most likely scenario is that we will continue to see a
balancing and counterbalancing of NATO and Russian forces in the High
North as both sides adjust to the realities of Swedish and Finnish
membership of NATO. The danger is that this could increase the risk of a
miscalculation provoked by an accident escalating into something worse.
More presence and platforms in a changing Arctic will undoubtedly bring
about more incidents, including environmental catastrophes and
human-made disasters, with indigenous peoples and other local
communities bearing the brunt of the impact.

Beyond that, we anticipate that [[the Arctic will remain in
limbo]{.mark} until one side or the other makes a move to either restore
or abandon the Arctic Council]{.underline}, or attempts to press a claim
that undermines the commitment that all the Arctic states made in
Ilulissat in 2008 (and again in 2018) to resolve their disputes in
accordance with international law. The wider risk is that in the absence
of a circumpolar approach, creeping alternatives will harden the
dividing lines between Russia and the West.

Neither side currently looks ready to blink first. China, meanwhile, may
seek to exploit the fragmentation of Arctic governance to push for its
own 'free for all' approach. All the while, human insecurity and climate
breakdown in the Arctic look set to worsen.

Islamabad : **[There is a need to study the causes of proxy wars, and
what are the potential impacts of such wars on the overall conflict.
These thoughts in a daylong [international seminar on]{.mark} 'Strategic
Dimensions of Peace and [Conflict in]{.mark}]{.underline}** South Asia
and **[[the Middle East]{.mark},' organised by Pak Institute for Peace
Studies (PIPS]{.underline}**), an Islamabad-based think tank,
**[[participated by prominent]{.mark} national and [international
scholars]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Prof]{.underline}**. Shahram **[Akbarzadeh]{.underline}**, Deakin
University, Australia, **[[argued]{.mark} there is significant gap in
the literature on non-state actors]{.underline}**. He called for
empirical research, along with concrete policy suggestions, on the
topic, so as to mitigate the conflicts in the region, in particular
South Asia and Middle East.

Speakers grappled at the notion of non-state actors and proxy wars: PIPS
director Muhammad Amir Rana said **[non-state actors often evoke
memories of violent elements]{.underline}**. This despite that as per
definition, non-state actors include organizations working for human
rights.

Prof. Syed Rifaat Hussain, Department of Government and Public Policy,
NUST, said the term "proxy wars" is a contested notion. There is no
universal agreement on its definition, nor on the set of circumstances
behind such wars. Interestingly, he said, proxy wars are as old as the
phenomena of conventional war itself.

Speakers noted **[[proxy wars are instruments of state
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As to why states go for it, it was argued,
**[it is [because they are]{.mark} often [cheap]{.mark} undertaking to
change the status quo]{.underline}**.

Participants noted over the decades, **[much of the [conflict involves
non-state actors]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Interstate
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}, on the other hand, **[[has
declined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In recent times, he said
**[[tit-for-tat tactics on behalf of such actors have reduced their
appeal.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Dr. Ibrahim **[Fraihat]{.underline}**, Doha Institute of Graduate
Studies, Doha, **[termed proxy war as an arms conflict between two
parties, though one of them is not directly involved]{.underline}**.
This way, **[domestic conflicts are escalated by external power
intervention]{.underline}**. At the same time, proxy war, if unresolved,
can take the shape of conventional war, the most significant example was
of Vietnam War. **[[In contemporary times]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he
lamented, **[[the Middle East has been rendered a stock market of proxy
organizations]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

William Gueriache, Associate Professor American University in the
Emirates Dubai, said on surface, all states support open diplomacy and
multilateralism. Yet the survival of patronage has paved the way for
foreign intervention during conflicts in the whole Middle East.

Dr. Marwan Kablan, Director Policy Analysis at the Arab Center for
Research and Policy Studies Doha, also hinted multiplicity of actors
involved in Syrian conflict, calling it as mother of conflicts in the
region. It was said that wars cannot be ended unless patron states
achieve their interests.

Dr. Shaheen Akhtar, Professor National Defence University Islamabad
focused on the apprehension of Pakistan about India's involvement in
Afghanistan. She said Pakistan's uneasy relationship with Kabul
reinforces a perception of encirclement while growing US-India strategic
cooperation further aggravates these apprehensions.

**[Dr]{.underline}**. Muhammad Riaz **[Shad]{.underline}**, National
University of Modern Languages (NUML) Islamabad, said **[[fighting
through proxies gives states an opportunity of
deniability]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The effects of climate change are reducing Arctic ice, which is leading
to more access, exploration, economic exploitation, and perhaps
eventually the attempted exclusion of those who are not present. And
with presence, of course, comes influence.6 But, [[in the Arctic, it is
extraordinarily challenging to sustain defense operations because of the
inherently hostile environment, great distances, and lack of support
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The operating environment in the North American Arctic is unique and
complicated. Infrastructure is sparse and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[harsh weather conditions pose a challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} to
development and maintenance. [[Communications networks are
unreliable]{.underline}]{.mark}, hampering already convoluted command
and control (C2) mechanisms. This in turn challenges US force movement,
maneuver, and sustainment. [[Situational awareness is lacking, due
to]{.underline}]{.mark} limited satellite coverage and [[high latitude
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}, higher levels of [[charged
particles]{.underline}]{.mark}, and complicated remote sensing, [[and
electromagnetic disruptions]{.underline}]{.mark} and other challenges
[[to positioning and navigation]{.underline}]{.mark} obstruct presence
and operations overall.

For many, the concept of [[armed forces' presence denotes physical and
technological capabilities: ships, submarines, aircraft, ground
vehicles, and similar platforms. There is no doubt that investment in
such platforms would greatly promote U.S. Arctic access and
presence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet [[the project TTX, interviews, and
computer modeling emphasized]{.underline}]{.mark} four [[other types of
essential capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} without which
next-generation or recapitalized platforms would not be effective or
even operational: trained [[personnel, domain awareness, communications,
and logistics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Personnel [[need to be acclimated to
operating in the extreme Arctic environment]{.underline}]{.mark}, where
even basic operational tasks can be difficult. [[Domain awareness
remains limited owing to]{.underline}]{.mark} the use of [[a single
Arctic-dedicated icebreaker]{.underline}]{.mark} (USCGC Healy), few
overflights, [[and relatively few early-warning
stations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Polar ionospheric conditions and poor
infrastructure hamper communication, while logistics suffer from few
roads and viable airstrips.

### Solvency\-\--Local Support

#### / Local support is critical to MDA

Maritime Domain: The Canadian Rangers
https://tedstevensarcticcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1_TSC_SR_Advancing_Solutions_MDA_Canadian_Rangers_FINAL.pdf
(ermo-MSDI, acc 7-2-2025)

There are five Canadian Ranger Patrol Groups across Canada, each
encompassing a distinct geographic area. The largest -- and perhaps most
well-studied -- is the 1st Canadian Ranger Patrol Group (1 CRPG), which
comprises more than 1850 members mostly drawn from Indigenous
communities in Yukon, the Northwest Territories (NWT), Nunavut, and
northern British Columbia (Lackenbauer & Kikkert, 2020, 1). These
members are organized into 61 patrols based in 65 communities across
Canada's High North (Lackenbauer & Kikkert, 2020, 1). The 1 CRPG is
responsible for an astounding 40 percent of Canada's territory,
approximating four million square miles, including almost 5,000 miles of
coastline (Lackenbauer & Kikkert, 2020, 1).

The Canadian [[Rangers play a significant role in enhancing Arctic
domain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} generally
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} contributing to the
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark} of the region. The Canadian Rangersserve
at least four purposes(Lackenbauer & Kikkert, 2020). First, the Canadian
Rangers possess [[extensive traditional knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}
of the Arctic environment and [[serve as a valuable resource
for]{.underline}]{.mark} conducting [[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}
and presence patrols. They monitor activities and report any suspicious
or unusual sightings to the appropriate authorities. Second, the
Canadian Rangers serve as Northern guides to help people operate in the
terrain and climate of the Canadian Arctic. Their [[deep knowledge of
the Arctic environment enables them to effectively
navigate]{.underline}]{.mark} and survive in [[challenging
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[providing]{.underline}]{.mark}
valuable [[situational awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}. Third, the
Canadian Rangers serve as liaisons for the Northern communities to
maintain positive interactions with the CAF, particularly those coming
up from regions outside the Canadian Arctic. Fourth, the Canadian
Rangers buttress cultural and community resilience. For example, youth
are recruited to participate in the Junior Canadian Ranger Program,
which teaches them not only how to function on the land, but how to
function in the community.

The Canadian Rangers have long played a role in the Arctic maritime
domain (Lackenbauer & Kikkert, 2020). Responsibilities include coastal
and inland water surveillance; [[tracking vessels]{.underline}]{.mark};
reporting unidentified vessels, unusual activities or sightings; [[and
collecting local data]{.underline}]{.mark} for the CAF. For example,
from August-September 2018, 1 CRPG deployed Rangers from patrols across
Nunavut and the NWT to monitor the Northwest Passage and report
suspicious vessels (Lackenbauer & Kikkert, 2020, 46).

(ermo-MSDI, acc 7-2-2025)

However, [[statutory restrictions on potential icebreaker
design]{.underline}]{.mark} and cost efficiencies60
[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} actually now [[be slowing icebreaker
acquisition]{.underline}]{.mark} plans. DHS, the DOD (particularly the
Navy and Marine Corps), and the Coast Guard should thus actively work
with the administration and Congress on smartly addressing these
existing restrictions in a manner that acknowledges that Arctic
security, safety, and governance, and thus icebreaker construction, is a
rare, truly national issue61 that transcends parochial interests.62
Further, [[the Coast Guard in particular must double down
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the development and public articulation of the
necessary national strategic [[ice-breaking capacity and
interoperability]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities, beyond the current
"6-3-1" (6 total, 3 heavy, and 1 now!) icebreaker talking point.63
While, to its great credit "6-3-1" certainly has helped frame the
discussion for somewhat initially skeptical lawmakers and the Trump
administration's Office of Management and Budget and National Security
Council staff,64 greater clarity is necessary with respect to vessel
type, number, and equipment outfit.65 Now is the time to gain that
clarity, [[so]{.underline}]{.mark} that Coast Guard
[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, starting with the PSC,
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} truly [[be the
critical]{.underline}]{.mark}ly important, [[go-anywhere,
do-everything]{.underline}]{.mark} [[lynchpin of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the type of joint [[defense and security operations]{.underline}]{.mark}
necessary to prevail in the Arctic.66

There's a saying in the Beltway that the urgent often overcomes the
important. We should address the Arctic as an important issue before it
becomes urgent. A growing sense of urgency is driven by the effects of
climate change and intensifying strategic competition in the region.

Much is already being done in practice to support the implementation of

stated that it [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} support the
[[construct]{.underline}]{.mark}ion of [[at least 8
icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark} for civilian and military needs. This
project will be carried out [[through cooperation with Canada and
Finland]{.underline}]{.mark}, which Washington announced in July 2024
27. The fact is that the United States has not built heavy icebreakers
for almost 50 years and is counting on technological assistance from its

program, there are serious doubts about the new

The third group of experts agrees with [[the offensive pathos of the US
military]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[assigns NATO a key
role]{.underline}]{.mark} as a guarantor of stability. However, even
they note that the nature of threats emanating from Russia as the main
military opponent of the US is not actual (requiring a substantive
response to the threat), but only potential: "Russian military
capabilities in the Arctic pose potential threats to the US and its
allies" 34. According to this point of view, in order for NATO as an
organization to guarantee stability in the region, it is necessary to
create logistical capabilities in the Arctic for the military presence
of non-Arctic NATO members. [[An arms race will be]{.underline}]{.mark}
an [[undesirable but inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark} process,

The Department of [[the Army's]{.underline}]{.mark} recently released
[[Arctic strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}24 [[focuses

are [[trained, equipped, and sustained to fight,]{.underline}]{.mark}

high-altitude conditions. To achieve this, the Army plans to establish
an operational two-star headquarters with uniquely trained and equipped
combat brigades to increase the Army's cold-weather capabilities. The
strategy also highlights the Army's need [[to improve the **material
readiness** of Arctic-capable units]{.underline}]{.mark} to conduct
extended operations in the Arctic region as well as the need to improve
individual and collective training of forces to operate in the region.
The Army also believes returning to the Arctic provides new
opportunities to engage and train with allies and partners who also
operate in extreme cold and high-altitude environments.

#### / Current submarine surveillance covers the GIUK gap

(ermo-MSDI, acc 7-2-2025)

Submarine surveillance has continued to be a focal point of Russia's
Arctic strategy into the 21 st century. The country's submarine program
has consistently received annual funding increases (Atland 2014, 153-4),
both in support of conventional tracking activities (Raymond 2016, 11-2)
and as investments in new deep sea data gathering capabilities. As part
of these innovative programs, Russian vessels routinely monitor undersea
communications cables for strategic intelligence (Dettmer 2019).

[[NATO has continued submarine surveillance in the GIUK
Gap]{.underline}]{.mark} to the present day (NATO n.d.) and Norway's
submarine program remains robust, most recently demonstrated with the
unveiling of the Marjata, one of the most advanced spy ships in the
world (Berglund 2016). North American [[Arctic states, however, have
shifted their focus away from traditional submarine warfare. The US and
Canada have jointly invested in a "system of systems" to monitor Arctic
waters]{.underline}]{.mark}, bringing together conventional patrol
vessels, radar stations, underwater sensors, and other assets to monitor
the maritime domain (The Government of Canada 2008, 17). Among [[the
most innovative of these]{.underline}]{.mark} developments [[are
sensor-enhanced buoys]{.underline}]{.mark} equipped with networked
communications, data sharing (Trevithick 2020), [[drone subs
and]{.underline}]{.mark} other unmanned maritime systems (Trevithick
2017). Other features also include [[fixed-position underwater and
shore-based sensors]{.underline}]{.mark} (US Department of Defense 2011,

[[These tools, while sophisticated, have **limitations**. **First**,

decision making about how to deal with a particular threat -- an

Despite this, however, [it is likely that [US military drone

successful testing of the latest MQ-9B Sky Guardian 'to support Arctic

growing **demand**]{.mark} for drones to fill a perceived capacity gap
in the face of growing Russian drone use, broader Russian military

(McCullough Hudson, 2020).

8 CONCLUSIONS

It is clear that [military [drone proliferation is now a **core
characteristic** of the Arctic]{.mark} security
[landscape]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is much to be studied as to how
technological innovations are applied in the Arctic space, and how
suspicions have deepened between Russia and the West. As this paper
argues, there is a security dilemma that rests, at least in part, on
military drone escalation and a growing recognition of the utility of
the drone. One need only think of Nagorno Karabakh, Libya, Ethiopia, or
Russia's offensive war in Ukraine to see the centrality of the drone to
the contemporary international security environment. This being said,
the Arctic, perhaps because of its misleading reputation as a place of
harmony and cooperation, has not been subject to scrutiny in terms of
the use of military drones. As such, the intent is that this article
will act as a point of departure from which future research can track,
assess, and warn about the impact of increasing military drone use
across the Arctic.
