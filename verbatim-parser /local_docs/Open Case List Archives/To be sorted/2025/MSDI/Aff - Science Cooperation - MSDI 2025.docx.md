### Solvency 

#### Plan: The United States federal government should significantly increase its exploration and/or development of the Arctic by restoring and increase scientific cooperation programs in the fields of climate change, conservation, and biodiversity protection with Russia and China in the Arctic.

#### US engagement in the arctic key to managing China's presence and activity in the region. Coordinated efforts can bring Russia back to the table while promoting US-Russia-China scientific cooperation. That promotes Arctic and global stability. Now is key to take action

Corporation. "What Does China\'s Arctic Presence Mean to the United
States?" RAND Corporation. December 29, 2022.

Researchers at RAND and the Swedish Defence Research Agency looked at
where China is operating in the Arctic, what it wants, and what that
could mean for regional security. They concluded that [**[China
has]{.mark}** made only limited inroads in the Arctic, but that\'s not
for lack of trying.]{.underline} "The threat should not be inflated,"
said Stephanie Pezard, a senior political scientist at RAND who
specializes in Arctic security. "But at the same time, [they have **[a
clear intent to not be excluded from Arctic]{.mark}** developments as
the region becomes more accessible.]{.underline} The real questions are,
How much of a role do they want, and [what does that mean for an Arctic
nation like the United States?"]{.underline} Conditions in the Arctic
have always been so extreme, the distances so vast, that even rivals
like the United States and Russia were forced to cooperate there. But
the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on the planet. Sea
routes that sailors and explorers have dreamed about for centuries are
starting to open. [The promise of Arctic riches---oil, minerals, trade
routes, even fish---has started to draw interest from far outside the
northern latitudes. China has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," a
designation it invented to push for a greater role in Arctic
governance]{.underline}. It has dispatched research expeditions, sought
to establish mining and gas operations, and envisioned a network of
shipping routes crossing the Arctic, a "silk road on ice." [It describes
itself as an "active participant, builder, and contributor in Arctic
affairs," one that has "spared no efforts to contribute its wisdom to
the development of the Arctic region."]{.underline} But in the Arctic,
as in the rest of the world, [the United States sees China as a
potentially destabilizing force]{.underline}, with the economic and
military power to try to bend the established order to its liking.
[**[The Pentagon considers China its "pacing challenge]{.mark}" of the
foreseeable future**. Its Arctic strategy, released in October, pays
particular attention to the risk of China using commercial or scientific
access to the Arctic for military advantage**.**]{.underline}
Researchers at RAND set out to document known Chinese activities in the
North American Arctic, which touches Alaska, Canada, and Greenland.
Their counterparts in Sweden focused on the European side, from Iceland,
through the Nordic countries, to Russia. What they found: Especially in
the North American Arctic, "there\'s not a ton going on," Pezard said.
China has invested in a handful of mining operations, mostly chasing
valuable rare earth minerals. It has trade partnerships with Greenland
and a small stake in a zinc mine in Alaska. A Chinese company tried to
buy a shuttered U.S. Navy base in Greenland, but the Danish government
quashed the idea. [China has used loans and infrastructure deals to prop
open the door for itself in countries]{.underline} across Asia, Africa,
and Latin America. [But the countries of the North American Arctic have
generally taken a hard look at any proposed Chinese investments---and
often a hard pass.]{.underline} Canada blocked a \$150 million gold mine
deal that would have put Chinese interests too close to military
installations. Greenland has held up plans for another Chinese mine over
concerns about pollution. "[**[We didn\'t see the more nefarious
activities]{.mark} that we\'ve seen in other parts of the world,** like
predatory lending or influence over local decisions, that are more
damaging to international norms,"]{.underline} said Stephen Flanagan, an
adjunct senior fellow at RAND and former senior director for defense
policy and strategy at the U.S. National Security Council. "All of the
governments are being careful in how they deal with China. It\'s a
\'buyer beware\' approach." RAND\'s study did not include the Russian
side of the Arctic. That may be China\'s best route to greater Arctic
influence. The Arctic Council, a governing body of Arctic States and
indigenous nations, suspended its meetings last year, refusing to engage
with Russia after it attacked Ukraine. A panel of experts that RAND
convened for its study noted that Russia could seek to form its own
Arctic governing council, with a more central role for its ally, China.
The experts thought that was possible, but not necessarily probable.
Despite its joint operation in the Bering Sea this past fall, and
codevelopment of a natural gas project in the Russian Arctic, **[[Moscow
has also been wary of letting China pursue its ambitions so close to its
home shores]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And rather than walk away from the
existing council, Russia has called for it to resume its meetings, with
Russia back at the table. For now, **[[the U.S. should continue to make
the Arctic a diplomatic, economic, and strategic priority]{.mark}, to
demonstrate its commitment to the region and its people]{.underline}**,
researchers concluded[. **[It should]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[work to
strengthen]{.underline}** solidarity among its Arctic allies---and
explore [**conditions under which it could [restart some engagement with
Russia]{.mark}**, such as on search-and-rescue
preparedness**.**]{.underline} But [the **U.S. should also recognize
that engaging with China in the Arctic does not have to be a win-or-lose
proposition. There are opportunities to [cooperate---on climate
change,]{.mark} for example[, or pollution control.]{.mark} China has
already played a key role** in international agreements **to protect
Arctic fisheries and** to create maritime **shipping regulations.** On
paper, at least, both **China and the United States are committed to
ensuring the Arctic remains a region of peace and stability. [The next
few years will be]{.mark}** a **[crucial]{.mark}** test]{.underline}. If
current projections hold, the Arctic could see its first ice-free summer
by 2030.

#### Russia Says Yes: Putin has explicitly courted the US for environmental cooperation in the Arctic. Russia is at the table, waiting for the US to join them. Any increase in cooperation also reduces the risk of accidental conflict from miscalculation

The [Kremlin chose to publicly develop this theme during
[Putin]{.mark}'s visit to Murmansk, which was timed to coincide with US
Vice President JD Vance's visit to Greenland.]{.underline} During his
participation in the 'Arctic: Territory of Dialogue' forum, [the Russian
president [called for cooperation with the US in the Arctic]{.mark} and
effectively voiced support for Washington's claims to
Greenland.]{.underline} He also pointed out that the question of
Greenland had nothing to do with Russia, while expressing concern that
NATO countries consider the North Pole a possible conflict zone. In
particular, the alliance's newest recruits, Finland and Sweden, have
been involved in military exercises in the territory. At the same forum,
[Dmitriev announced [Russia's plan to create a special investment
fund]{.mark} for Arctic development by the end of the year]{.underline}.
[This fund, he claimed, would attract capital from partners in the GCC
and "a number of Western countries". He also noted [the US has shown
interest in investing]{.mark} in Russia's Arctic region, including LNG
projects]{.underline}. On the one hand[,]{.mark} [the Kremlin's
exploitation of the Arctic can be viewed within the framework of
Russia's diplomatic approach to the current US administration[.]{.mark}
[Moscow is ready]{.mark} to throw decorative minor concessions to Trump
[in]{.mark} order to prevent fundamental disagreements over Ukraine from
interfering with [the restoration of bilateral
relations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Good cop/bad cop Moreover, [in his
communication with the US, Putin uses the traditional good cop/bad cop
tactic, with the role of the good guy played by Dmitriev. Experienced
diplomats and security officials, meanwhile, are left to play the
hardliners]{.underline}. At the same time, [[the Russian president
realises that both groups are bound to compete]{.mark} with each other[,
leading to more effective negotiations and honest
reporting]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [Kremlin is also well aware that
Trump's Arctic ambitions -- such as acquiring Greenland, increasing
activity within the framework of the Icebreaker Cooperation Effort
(ICE), and purchasing icebreakers from Finland---are directly related to
the containment of Russia's Arctic expansion and the build-up of US
military infrastructure in the region.]{.underline} At the same time,
Washington's Arctic policy is not only related to Trump's business
acumen -- it follows on from previous administrations. During Joe
Biden's presidency, for example, the US made a qualitative leap in
Arctic policy. It mentioned the Arctic in its National Security
Strategy, adopted a new Arctic strategy, established the post of Arctic
ambassador, concluded an alliance with Canada and Finland, and initiated
large-scale modernisation of the joint North American Aerospace Defence
Command with Ottawa. So, [[while Moscow and Washington continue to play
geopolitical chess]{.underline}]{.mark}---anticipating and concealing
their next moves---[[dialogue helps reduce mutual
misunderstanding]{.underline}]{.mark}. Prior to the war in Ukraine,
[Russia invested heavily in rebuilding its Arctic military presence,
which is now much larger than all other countries in the Arctic
combined]{.underline}. However, almost all of its facilities are
concentrated in the western Arctic, specifically the Kola Peninsula,
with the exception of a small cluster on the Novosibirsk Islands.

#### China Says Yes: They realize they can't be aggressive in the Arctic and need the expertise of Arctic nations

**Zhuang 2025.** Sylvie Zhuang, Senior Reporter, China for SCMP.
"Warming US-Russia ties could put China's Arctic ambitions on ice,
experts warn" South China Morning Post. March 16, 2025.

[[China is expected to]{.mark} redefine its Arctic policy - including an
ambition to [become a great polar power by 2030]{.mark}]{.underline} -
amid growing scrutiny from far northern countries and a possible
US-Russia cooperation deal for the region, according to experts and
insiders. [Beijing put forward its plan for a \"Polar Silk Road\" - as a
complement to its massive infrastructure scheme, the Belt and Road
Initiative - in a 2018 white paper that envisioned greater access to the
Arctic\'s rich natural resources and a bigger role in its
governance.]{.underline} China\'s description of itself in the plan as a
\"near-Arctic state\" - despite sitting 1,400km (870 miles) south of the
Arctic Circle and having no territory in the region - raised the
suspicions of the US and its allies, in the midst of intensifying
geopolitical rivalries. It also provoked a backlash from the Arctic
countries - including Russia, which stretches across more than half of
the region\'s coastline and has long prioritised maintaining its
sovereignty there. Since then, [[China has put]{.mark} more [emphasis on
science diplomacy]{.mark} - including a focus on [building heavy
icebreakers]{.mark} and carrying out polar observations - while largely
[toning down its other ambitions]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to Marc
Lanteigne, a professor of political science at the Arctic University of
Norway, \"[China has]{.underline} been trying to rework what the Polar
Silk Road is all about and it has also [started to take a more practical
approach to the Arctic]{.underline}\". An insider with direct knowledge
of the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that
Beijing\'s interest in continuing its Arctic push had appeared to
decline in response to the geopolitical tensions. \"The Chinese interest
was really first announced quite aggressively in the white paper
\[with\] the term near-Arctic state that everybody seems to have had
problems with,\" the insider said. \"Now the Chinese have stopped using
that term and I think we\'ve seen a withdrawal, or a significantly lower
Chinese interest in the Arctic.\" However, Duncan Depledge, an Arctic
expert and lecturer in geopolitics and security at Loughborough
University in Britain, noted the continued emphasis on building heavy
icebreakers. \"I\'m not convinced that China\'s interest in the Arctic
has declined,\" he said. \"I believe [[China is]{.mark} still very
[interested in]{.mark} many of the [opportunities]{.mark} that exist [to
become more involved in Arctic science]{.mark} and
commerce.\"]{.underline} The commitment to carry out polar observations
and develop heavy icebreakers is part of China\'s national development
strategy, written into the 14th five-year plan for 2021-25. China now
has four of the sturdy vessels, of which the latest is the Jidi, which
means \"polar region\". It was completed last year to support research
in the Arctic alongside the Xuelong 1 and Xuelong 2 icebreakers. In an
interview with People\'s Daily in October, the China State Shipbuilding
Corporation\'s chief expert Wu Gang said that \"the key technical
challenge now for China is to build heavy icebreakers\". [With expertise
concentrated in the Arctic nations]{.underline} and only Russia
possessing nuclear-powered icebreakers, [China still faced a \"long and
difficult road ahead\",]{.underline} according to Wu\'s remarks in the
report.

### 1AC -- Science Diplomacy

[[Disease surveillance]{.mark} in the thawing Arctic [requires
international cooperation]{.mark}, [but fractured
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} between Russia and the other Arctic
states [[demand deliberate]{.mark} approaches to **[science
diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [During]{.underline} the summer of
[2016]{.underline}, in Russia's arctic Yamal Peninsula, [[a heat wave
resurfaced anthrax]{.mark} bacteria long buried in the
permafrost]{.underline}. [The bacteria [then killed thousands of
reindeer and affected]{.mark} nearly a hundred local
[residents]{.mark}]{.underline}---the first large outbreak of anthrax in
the region since 1941. The world reacted with concerned curiosity: [What
other viruses and bacteria could the thawing permafrost bring back to
life]{.underline}? Microbiologists and cold region experts have since
set out to deepen our understanding of how [changes to [climate]{.mark}
and weather patterns]{.underline} in the Arctic may
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} human and animal [[exposure to
novel]{.underline}]{.mark}---or really, really
old---[[pathogens]{.mark}]{.underline} freed from dormancy. Over the
last few decades, the international community has dedicated significant
resources to building up networks to detect and combat tropical disease.
But [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} 2016 anthrax
[[outbreak]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with research on other viral
strains recovered from permafrost since, [[shows]{.mark} just [how
important scientific cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} and public health
surveillance [[are]{.mark} in polar regions]{.underline}. Monitoring
public health in the Arctic is challenging. The region is home to about
4 million people scattered across roughly 6 million square miles. Unlike
the global commons of Antarctica, the Arctic is comprised of sovereign
territories and exclusive economic zones of eight nations. Nonetheless,
during the COVID-19 pandemic, Arctic public health analyses were based
on data disaggregated at national, regional, and local levels; the
cooperation, transparency, and communication required for this joint
activity were themselves important feats of pan-Arctic collaboration.
Another accomplishment is the International Circumpolar Surveillance
program, which monitors the spread of pneumococcal, meningococcal, and
Haemophilus influenzae bacteria through a network, launched in 1999, of
hospitals and public health offices in seven of the eight Arctic
states---all but Russia. Until the 1990s, the Russian Federation's
infectious disease control systems evolved independently from Western
public health systems, making cross-border surveillance and cooperation
difficult. But when a sharp rise in diseases including HIV and
tuberculosis in the Baltic Sea and Barents Sea regions demanded joint
action on control and prevention, a process for collaboration began.
Eventually, [a rising interdependence on]{.underline} such
[[international collaboration shifted Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark}
foreign policy [[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} for health [[toward
multilateral]{.underline}]{.mark} and bilateral
[[diplomacy.]{.underline}]{.mark} Today, new geopolitical tensions are
renewing complications in scientific and health cooperation with Russia.
When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Arctic states of
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States
suspended the Arctic Council's cooperation with Russia. In the months
since, Russia has threatened to withdraw from the Arctic Council, the
leading intergovernmental forum for the region. In September 2023, it
formally withdrew from the 30-year-old Barents Euro-Arctic Council. At
the same time, warming temperatures in the Arctic are opening sea routes
and allowing new access to natural resources, prompting increased
traffic and cooperation between Arctic and non-Arctic states. Climate
change is destabilizing the health, food security, and livelihoods of
people in the area. We argue that, [in mutually dependent regions like
the Arctic, [scientific research]{.mark} on climate]{.underline} and
health [[can sustain channels for diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Indeed, new---even experimental---[strategies for cooperation are
necessary at this critical time]{.underline}.

And finally, [[the international community]{.underline}]{.mark} still

of microbial diversity]{.underline}, such as mass bird-nesting sites.
[Such monitoring activities can reinforce or create points of contact

to buttress the goals of the Arctic Council's 10-year-old One Arctic,
One Health project, [[which aims to improve]{.underline}]{.mark}
coordination and strategies for [[handling emerging

for [a pandemic]{.underline} that has [[led to millions of deaths and
trillions]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars [[in]{.mark} economic
[losses]{.mark}]{.underline}, and has upended daily life. However,
notwithstanding the severe damage caused by
[[COVID]{.underline}-]{.mark}19, it [[should be viewed as a **warning
shot**]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 It will not be the last pandemic humanity
faces, and [[the next]{.underline}]{.mark} high-consequence [[biological
event could be]{.underline}]{.mark} as destructive or [[substantially
worse]{.underline}]{.mark}. We define [[global catastrophic biological
risks]{.underline}]{.mark} (GCBRs) as biological events of tremendous
scale that [[could cause **severe damage to human
civilization**]{.underline}]{.mark}, potentially [[jeopardizing]{.mark}
its]{.underline} long-term **[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**.2 The
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has also developed a working
definition of GCBRs,3 and this term is part of a broader discussion
about global catastrophic risks that could arise from a variety of
sources, including nuclear war, anthropogenic climate change, and
advanced artificial intelligence that has not been sufficiently
safeguarded.4,5 [[GCBRs could be caused by]{.mark} a naturally emerging
[infectious disease]{.mark} outbreak, [an accidental release of a
pathogen, or a deliberate attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Naturally
emerging infectious disease outbreaks that can grow into]{.mark}
[pandemics are likely to increase in frequency ]{.mark}]{.underline}due
to urbanization, globalization, and environmental degradation, and the
world faces an increasing risk of high-consequence biological events
resulting from accidental or deliberate misuse of the tools of modern
bioscience and biotechnology.6-8 Not all outbreaks or global pandemics
will grow to the scale of a GCBR as we define it in this article and as
others have defined global catastrophic risks more broadly, because the
threshold for this type of event is extremely high. [Although COVID-19
does not rise to the level of a GCBR-scale event, it has demonstrated
that a biological event can have a devastating global
impact]{.underline}, and it should serve as a warning to global leaders
that the world needs much more robust protections against
high-consequence biological events that could emerge in the future and
be substantially worse. In our view, human-caused biological events
involving the accidental or deliberate misuse of an [engineered pathogen
are more likely to lead to a GCBR-scale event than a naturally emerging
pandemic.9 [Scientists have the capacity to]{.mark} deliberately or
inadvertently [engineer pathogens]{.mark} [that are more virulent and
transmissible]{.mark} than what nature creates by chance,
and]{.underline} the upper limit of damage that could be caused by a
human-engineered biological event is unknown.10-12 [[Prevention, **early
detection**, and **rapid response** are all crucial for guarding against
GCBR-scale events]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, in this article, we
focus on effective strategies for preventing biological events that
could become GCBRs, specifically by disincentivizing development and use
of biological weapons by states and other powerful actors.

#### Independently, The Arctic presents multiple scenarios for nuclear conflict between the US, NATO, Russia, and China. However, concentrated diplomacy can bypass the Status Quo's grandstanding. That prevents unintended nuclear escalation from miscalc, grey zone attacks, accidental launches, and retaliation.

Long gone are the days of "duck and cover" drills and fallout shelters
in America, when the fears of nuclear war were on the minds of most.
[For decades]{.underline}, cooler heads prevailed, and the [[U.S. and
Russia worked cooperatively to reduce]{.mark} the risk of [nuclear
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} and decrease the size of their arsenals.
[[By 2022, cooperation began disintegrating]{.mark}]{.underline} as
Russia's botched invasion of Ukraine raised serious concerns about
nuclear escalation and severely hampered the prospects of future nuclear
arms control agreements. With Russia seemingly dismissing the Trump
administration's rather conciliatory efforts to end the war, there
appears to be no end in sight, and Europe is feeling the pressure,
embarking on a massive effort to boost its own defense. [Amidst these
tensions, [melting polar ice is opening Arctic sea lanes to
increased]{.mark}]{.underline} shipping [traffic]{.underline}, resource
[exploration, and [military posturing]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO's
newest members, Finland and Sweden, are Arctic nations. [Russia
currently dominates the Arctic region]{.underline}, holding 53% of its
total coastline, operating the world's biggest icebreaker fleet, and has
been upgrading its Arctic military bases. [[China is also]{.mark}
increasingly [playing a role]{.mark}, conducting joint Arctic military
exercises with Russia]{.underline} and employing an icebreaker fleet of
its own, despite its complete lack of territory in the Arctic Circle.
But is the Arctic destined to be the most likely flashpoint for a
nuclear war? Let's look at the possibilities. Despite being so cold,
[the Arctic is no stranger to military conflict, holding major strategic
value and serving as a passageway to both the Atlantic and
Pacific]{.underline}. During World War II, the Battle of the Atlantic
extended into the Arctic and ships carrying American war supplies to the
Soviet Union traversed the Northern Sea Route. Germany invaded Norway,
and the Soviet Union invaded Finland in the Winter War of 1940. [As the
Cold War evolved, the Arctic became a major theater for submarine
activity.]{.underline} Today, President Trump's insistence on acquiring
Greenland "one way or the other" highlights the growing importance of
the Arctic to the security interests of the United States. Greenland's
geographic location, combined with the U.S.' operation of Pituffik Space
Base in the high north, provides key "missile warning, missile defense,
and space surveillance" capabilities. [[The shortest flight paths for
nuclear missiles between the U.S. and Russia exist over the
Arctic]{.mark} Ocean]{.underline}, and the loss of this base on account
of a diplomatic blunder could open a key blind spot in America's
strategic defense. Alternatively, the loss of this base to a Russian
attack aimed at disabling American missile detection infrastructure is
unlikely due to the danger of immediate retaliation and escalation.
Currently, [the most likely path to [a potential nuclear exchange in the
Arctic would be through a conventional or "gray zone" Russian attack on
a NATO member.]{.mark} Border skirmishes, cyber-attacks, airspace
incursions, reckless military intercepts]{.underline}, and support to
separatist groups intentionally sit in the "gray zone" between peace and
outright war, but could ultimately lead to open conflict [[that]{.mark}
[escalates to nuclear war]{.mark}. Conceivably, a gray zone or overt
attack on other Greelandic infrastructure, or an information operations
campaign aimed at dividing the U.S., Greenland, and Denmark, are not
outside of the realm of possibility.]{.underline} [With NATO's addition
of Sweden and, more importantly, Finland]{.underline}---which shares a
1,343 km border with Russia---[there is increased opportunity that a
NATO Arctic state could be attacked]{.underline}. Highlighting this
risk, American forces in Alaska recently staged a drill in which
hundreds of troops were flown to Finland to defend against a mock
Russian invasion. Yet rather than an overt invasion of a NATO member,
[Russia is far more likely test the waters by conducting provocative and
destabilizing small-scale gray zone activities.]{.underline} The
disastrous results of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have likely raised
doubts in Moscow about its ability to achieve its objectives in a direct
attack on a nuclear armed country, let alone a large NATO ally, making a
direct attack unlikely. It is not entirely clear where the red line on
gray zone activities would be for Finland or what would trigger an
Article 5 collective defense declaration short of a direct attack across
the border. Though the threat of American nuclear weapons has
long-served to deter a Russian attack on the European NATO members,
President Trump's many public pronouncements expressing doubt about his
willingness to defend a NATO member that comes under attack has shaken
confidence in Europe about America's commitment. As a result, [France
and the UK are considering expanding their arsenals,]{.underline}
signifying an increased reliance on nuclear posturing for deterrence,
including for the defense of Arctic NATO members. France is
reconsidering whether it wants to decommission its current warheads as
it brings replacements online, potentially doubling of the size of its
arsenal. It is simultaneously upgrading an airbase closer to the German
border to be able to host nuclear weapons. The UK, which has been
historically dependent on the U.S. for its nuclear arsenal, is recently
questioning that dependence, and may seek other options to assure an
effective and reliable deterrent. This could foretell a new nuclear arms
race. The upcoming February 2026 expiration of New START, the last
remaining strategic nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia,
portends a period of nuclear proliferation that could echo the nuclear
arms buildups of the Cold War. Meanwhile, [China, which has been
operating in the Arctic, has been engaging in its own rapid nuclear
buildup in an effort to potentially exceed 1,000 warheads by
2035]{.underline}. China has consistently rejected efforts to join a
multilateral nuclear arms reduction treaty with the U.S. and Russia,
citing its comparatively much smaller nuclear arsenal. [[Navigation
issues]{.mark} in the Arctic [could also lead to military escalations
reaching the nuclear level]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which includes satellite
constellations like the American GPS system or Russian GLONASS, sees
decreased reliability and accuracy in the Arctic. The reasons for this
are abundant, like the orbital inclination of the satellites themselves
and ionospheric interference. [With increased incidents of Russian GNSS
jamming in Europe, it's conceivable that Russia may employ similar
tactics in the Arctic]{.underline}, including spoofing, for the purpose
of disruption or causing navigational errors to trigger an exploitable
international incident. Military or civilian vessels straying into
Russian territory could be captured, their cargoes seized, or crews held
hostage for the purpose of conducting hostage diplomacy. [Resolving such
a confrontation military could quickly spiral out of
control.]{.underline} Yet considering these combined factors, the Arctic
does not exist in a vacuum, and there are other regions in which nuclear
tensions are rising. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is the
most likely scenario for a direct confrontation between the United
States and another nuclear power. Though he has not signaled any
specific intent to attack, President Xi aims for the Chinese military to
be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027. While President Biden indicated
his intention to directly aid Taiwan if this occurred, President Trump
appears to defer to the traditional American position of strategic
ambiguity over the island. Should China decide to invade, and the U.S.
responds to defend Taiwan, it is difficult to see Washington opting to
detonate a nuclear weapon over an issue that does not directly threaten
the U.S. mainland or a NATO ally. On the other hand, a subsequent attack
on Chinese mainland military sites in order to disable an attacking
Chinese invasion force could plausibly incite a nuclear response. [What
is most concerning is that [provocative military
behavior]{.mark}]{.underline} anywhere [[could lead to an unintentional
cycle of escalation that]{.mark} ultimately [results in a nuclear
exchange. As the Arctic opens]{.mark} to more]{.underline} military and
commercial [activity, the frequency of encounters between military
forces is likely to increase. As those encounters [increase]{.mark}, so
too does [the probability that an accident or unintended attack may
occur]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Russia routinely flies patrols into the
Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone, an area of international air
space in which the U.S. identifies all aircraft, aggressive behavior by
Russian pilots raises the risk of a routine encounter evolving into an
international incident. But these aggressive incidents are much more
frequent elsewhere, like the Baltic and North Seas. For example, in
2022, a Russian SU-27 fighter jet fired two missiles against a British
RC-135 surveillance jet over the Black Sea, but fortunately neither
missile hit their target. Similarly, China is known for conducting
frequent unsafe intercepts of foreign aircraft in the East and South
China Seas. In the end, [the likeliness that the Arctic or any other
region sees the confrontation leading to nuclear war is more about the
actors involved and the choices they make rather than the regions
themselves. Actors committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes will
find ways to preserve that peace. Yet [in an era of]{.mark} machismo[,
confrontation,]{.mark} and conquest, [we could all find ourselves
walking off a dangerous cliff from which there is no
return.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Only the plan solves war. Reinvigorating science diplomacy in the arctic through environmental cooperation is the key to deescalating global tensions. The bonds built through this process build global stability and cooperation. It's try or die for the affirmative.

[The final prerequisite for common interests is that the Arctic states
have separate issue areas and remain flexible in keeping them
so]{.underline}. This is mostly done by leaving highly political issues,
particular those dealing with military-security and fisheries, out of
the joint agenda of the Arctic Council. A footnote to the Ottawa
Declaration (1996) states: "The Arctic Council should not deal with
matters related to military security." [[By consciously separating issue
areas, "they are less affected by tensions or break- downs in other
areas,"]{.mark} and agendas can be set based on common interests and
shared problems]{.underline} (Byers 2017, 388, 391). Furthermore,
despite the mutual agreement that the Arctic Council (consisting of the
"Arctic Eight" and the Permanent Participants \[A8+\]) is the main
high-level forum for intergovernmental cooperation, there is a practice
of creating coalitions among the Arctic states, and the Arctic states
and the observer countries, for handling certain issues. The best
example of this is the "Arctic Five" (A5), i.e. the five Arctic coastal
states---Canada, Kingdom of Denmark, Norway, the Russian Federation and
the U.S.A.---that formed to agree on governing the Arctic Ocean
(Ilulissat Declaration 2008). Another coalition of 10 countries
co-signed the Fisheries Agreement in 2017. [The wisdom behind this is to
emphasize the joint will between the Arctic states to maintain the
status quo and decrease military tension and increase political
stability]{.underline}. This was clearly expressed by the first preamble
of the declaration of the ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council in
May 2017, at which the foreign ministers of all eight Arctic states were
present for the first time: "\[R\]eaffirming the commitment to maintain
peace, stability, and constructive cooperation in the Arctic" (Fairbanks
Declaration 2017). These words are taken as speech act, which, along
with texts, (re)shape the reality and construct geopolitics (e.g.,
Moisio 2003). Unlike (new) realism argues, based on Alexander Wendt's
claim that "anarchy is what states make of it" (Lamy et al. 2013, 124),
the [Arctic states believe they can (re)construct their reality of
post-Cold War Arctic geopolitics]{.underline}. This is a constructivist
approach, since the "forces of power go beyond material; they also can
be ideational of discursive" (Lamy et al. 2013, 125). This acceptance of
ideas and "power based on knowledge" is more than "power based on force"
and control over state sovereignty. The Arctic has "remained largely
insulated from wider geopolitical issues" following the conflicting
events of 2014 (Clifford 2017). [This means [there are chances to deepen
cooperation in existing fields and broaden the scope of cooperation into
new issue areas, as well as increase]{.mark} human capital for
[confidence-building]{.mark}]{.underline} (Heininen 2016). To conclude
this section, these prerequisites, together with the common interests of
the Arctic states, and the understanding of their benefits, consist of a
solid ground for high geopolitical stability of the post-Cold War
Arctic. [[This is a proper foundation on which to build in the
future]{.mark}, since it has already passed the first tests and shown
itself to be resilient. In the next section, I conclude these findings
and briefly define which special features could be recognized as
potential new themes of Arctic geopolitics and international relations,
based on these common interests and prerequisites.]{.underline} 13.5
Conclusion [[The Arctic region plays a key role in the global
ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark} and bio-geophysical processes that are
heavily affected by pollution, climate change, and other global changes.
The Arctic region is also closely integrated with the global economy and
energy security dynamics, so it relates to world politics. [Long-range
[pollution]{.mark} was the first trigger for a wake-up call to the
Arctic states, due to a growing concern about the environment by
non-state actors, such as indigenous peoples, NGOs, and scientists
[and]{.mark} scholars to start functionally cooperating for
environmental protection. This was followed by [climate warming]{.mark}
as another trigger]{.underline}, which [[caused wide concern about rapid
environmental changes]{.underline}]{.mark} and their local and global
socio-economic and political consequences. There are difficult
challenges and problems, and [the warming Arctic is a potential tipping
point for the entire planet]{.underline}. This means that the (post)
post-Cold War Arctic is globalized, and [that the environment matters a
great deal in Arctic geopolitics]{.underline}. Since then, there have
been significant changes [in Arctic geopolitics]{.underline}, from the
confrontation of the Cold War period to the current state of
transboundary cooperation. [The region is not over-run by military
conflicts or disarmamen]{.underline}t. Instead, [transboundary
cooperation is peaceful, with high geopolitical stability]{.underline}.
However, heavy Russian and American, military, nuclear-weapon systems
are still deployed in the region. [International cooperation between the
Arctic states and Arctic Council observer countries continues, and has
handled growing tension between Russia and the West. **[The common
interests of the Arctic states to decrease military tension and increase
political stability via functional cooperation on environmental
protection are the basis for the current successful geopolitical
situation in the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore, long-term
business relations, as well as [[international scientific cooperation,
will be needed to maintain cooperation and high stability]{.mark} for
sustainable economic development in the region]{.underline}. However,
certain features of Arctic geopolitics, such as the original nature of
the military, firm state sovereignty, a high degree of legal certainty,
and flexible agenda setting, were prerequisites for the ability to
decrease military tension and increase political stability. Following
from this, the first conclusion of this article is that [the high
geopolitical stability of the Arctic is conscious, manmade, and
resilient]{.underline}. Another conclusion is that the state of
post-Cold War Arctic geopolitics has certain special features, based on
the common interests of the Arctic states and the prerequisites for
transboundary cooperation. Among them are: [Arctic geopolitics and
security are combined and closely related to the environment; the Arctic
is exceptional in its current geopolitical situation in the current
world political climate filled with uncommon instabilities; and the
Arctic has become part of global, multi-dimensional (political,
economic, technological, environmental, and societal) change, which has
significant worldwide implications]{.underline}. [These special features
could have potential as new avenues of geopolitical study of the global
Arctic]{.underline}. For example, to (re)place the Arctic within the
context of global, multi-dimensional change and explore worldwide
implications would possibly define the global Arctic in a new
geopolitical context. Alternatively, [[the highly stable Arctic region
could be become a potential asset to]{.mark} reformulate a state of
world politics with uncommon]{.underline} in[stability]{.underline}.
Finally, [a global, stable Arctic region could have the same kind of de
facto status as the Antarctic as a global commons for peaceful and
scientific purposes under its governorship by the Antarctic Treaty
System.]{.underline}

The weeks following [Trump's inauguration has seen significant **cuts**
and mass **firings** of federal employees]{.underline} in the US. The
Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Elon Musk, is
reaching far into the government apparatus, finding ways to cut costs
and eliminate threats to the new order.

[The **[Arctic research]{.mark}** community [in the US is]{.mark} also
[facing **severe cutbacks**]{.mark} and reduced funding]{.underline},
prompting serious concerns about the future of Arctic research and
research diplomacy in the region.

Three years after Russia invaded Ukraine and the subsequent loss of all
scientific cooperation with Russia, the region could now be on the brink
of losing yet another major player in the North.

As [**climate change** continues to be the **biggest threat** to the
Arctic]{.underline}, many worry about the implications of the US federal
cuts for the region\'s climate.

Targeting climate research

While information regarding the mass firings and cutbacks executed by
DOGE is still uncertain, sources such as the New York Magazine report
that 30,000 federal workers have been given notice. The mass firings
have mainly targeted probationary workers, 200,000 of the total of 2.4
million federal workers.

The journal Science recently reported that the [[mass firings were
**decimating**]{.mark} US [science agencies]{.mark}]{.underline}, saying
the \"layoffs decimated the foot soldiers of many health and science
agencies, sweeping up early-career scientists as well as old hands in
new positions.\"

The [[Trump]{.mark} administration has [consistently **targeted
climate** research by **cutting grants** and]{.mark} other
[support]{.mark} for any science endeavors]{.underline} that focus on
climate change. [Many of the US president\'s January **executive
orders** focused on **cutting** or eradicating **climate
programs**]{.underline} specifically in an effort to roll back
environmental and climate change initiatives that were implemented under
the Biden administration.

[[The US has]{.mark} now [**withdrawn** from]{.mark} the
**[Paris]{.mark} Agreement** and essentially **stopped** wind
power]{.underline} development. In addition, the Trump administration is
trying to undo the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in
climate and energy in American history.

[Even the term \'climate change\' is now subject to **severe
restrictions**]{.underline}. It has been removed from official websites,
grants, and other support, and researchers must be careful not to use it
if they want to keep their funding.

Project 2025 is coming to fruition

The deconstruction of climate research initiatives and institutions is a
continuation of the work Trump commenced in his first term by rolling
back more than 125 environmental rules and policies, according to Time
magazine. It also corresponds to the agenda set in Project 25, the
political initiative to reshape the US federal government, published by
the conservative Heritage Foundation.

President Trump distanced himself from the Project 2025 initiative
during his campaign but has implemented much of the project\'s agenda
since taking office.

The initiative calls for an increase in oil and gas drilling through
eradicating environmental protections, as well as repealing the
Inflation Reduction Act introduced by the Biden administration.

Consequences for the climate

[[The **attack** on **climate** research incites **far-reaching**
reactions]{.mark}, also in [the Arctic.]{.mark} Climate **warming**
takes place at a much **higher rate** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}
than the rest of the world, making climate intervention a pressing
matter.

Mia Bennett, a political geographer at the University of Washington,
says that although [the US **mass [firings]{.mark}** [and cuts]{.mark}
in funding [**risk** losing the ability to]{.mark} **closely
[monitor]{.mark}** [climate change]{.mark} and **understand** its
accelerating nature]{.underline}, we already know a lot about what is
happening with the climate and the fact that we need to act.

\"[We know we need to reduce carbon emissions, and yet [**not enough**
action has been taken]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is why it is not only
the cuts to climate research but the withdrawal from the Paris
Agreement, too, which are also deeply worrying,\" she says.

NOAA cuts

[One scientific agency facing **mass firings** is the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (**NOAA**).]{.underline} At the end of
last week, reports emerged stating that between 600 and 900 employees
had lost their jobs at the world-renowned center. While exact numbers
are still unclear, reports say that several hundred more are expected to
leave voluntarily through the so-called deferred resignation program.

The NOAA plays a massive role in Arctic research, perhaps most notably
through the Arctic Report Card, published annually as an overview of the
environmental developments in the Arctic. The NOAA cuts were also
heralded in the Project 25 initiative.

Bennett says, \"NOAA maintains numerous satellites that observe the
Arctic. For decades, these satellites have provided crucial data about
features like sea ice to decision-makers and residents in the Arctic
alike. The cuts to NOAA mean everything from the annual Arctic report
card to sea ice forecasts may fall by the wayside. This doesn't only
jeopardize science and weather forecasting, but human lives, too.\"

\"In addition, cuts to NOAA alarmingly indicate that we may lose the
ability to maintain real-time monitoring and issue sufficient early
warnings of potentially dangerous weather systems like hurricanes.
Hurricanes are considered a natural disaster, but the reckless actions
of the Trump administration indicate how much the consequences of these
events are socially produced, too.\"

#### U.S.-China [climate cooperation]{.underline} in the Arctic is [necessary]{.underline} to mitigate climate change.

The 2021 United States-China dialogue in Alaska began with unprecedented
harsh accusations from both sides, but by the end of the summit, the top
diplomats from both countries were obliged to agree that there are
several areas [[where U.S. and Chinese interests
**intersect**]{.underline}]{.mark}. One of these issues [[is the
**climate**]{.mark} **crisis**. [The two]{.mark} sides
[expressed]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[**willingness** to enhance
**cooperation**]{.mark} in tackling climate change]{.underline} and
stated that they will "establish a joint working group on that
subject."1)

[The Arctic, warming at nearly **three times** the global average, is a
glaring **focal point** for the U.S.-China climate change working
group]{.underline}. Based on an existing history of bilateral
collaborations, [[U.S.-China **scientific cooperation**]{.mark} to
tackle climate change [in the Arctic is **achievable** and can have
meaningful benefits **even** in the face of **mounting
hostilities**]{.mark}]{.underline} between the two countries. This
article focuses on [[these]{.mark} countries]{.underline} as they [[are
the]{.mark} two **[largest]{.mark}** carbon dioxide [**emitters** and
**leaders** in]{.mark} the production of [knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- as measured by the number of scientific publications. There is
likewise Chinese scientific cooperation with other Arctic states.

What is China's role in the changing Arctic?

As the largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world, China is fulfilling
its responsibility to the rest of the world to contribute to global
knowledge on climate change. China's rise as an industrial power has
produced black carbon emissions that have played a significant role in
the warming Arctic.2) Conversely, China is affected by changes in the
Far North. The loss of sea ice and altered wind circulation in the
Arctic was found to contribute to China's "airpocalypse" -- severe air
pollution that hung over eastern China for nearly a month in 2013.
Scientists warn that the warming Arctic will continue to have severe
effects on China.3) The climate crisis in the Arctic -- in the form of
sea-level rise, loss of sea ice, and rising ocean and air temperatures
-- affects all countries with no regard for national borders.

The rapidly changing Arctic and the internationalization of "the Arctic
situation" form the rationale for Beijing's interests in the Far North,
according to documents published by China's State Council Information
Office.4) China has formalized its Arctic ambitions with an official
Arctic Policy published in 2018 that outlines aims to develop
infrastructure, shipping routes, and energy extraction in the Far North.
The document declares that China is ready to participate in Arctic
governance and work with other nations in scientific research, academic
exchanges, and environmental observation. "[China will **improve** the
capacity and capability in scientific **research** on the
Arctic]{.underline} \[and\] pursue a deeper understanding and knowledge
of the Arctic science ... so as [to create **favorable** conditions for
mankind to better **protect**, develop, and govern the
Arctic]{.underline}."5)

However, some scholars argue that China's official approach to polar
research and emphasis on international collaboration is for symbolic
reasons. Some analysts argue that Chinese Arctic science is meant to
advance China's strategic interests in the region which may ultimately
include a military component.6) There is a concern that scientific
research serves a "dual purpose" and is a precursor to the development
of Arctic military technology. For example, Anne-Marie Brady points to
studies by Chinese academics examining the feasibility of Chinese
submarines navigating the Arctic.7)

Can Arctic states cooperate with China in understanding the Arctic if
China's Arctic intentions are still hotly debated?8) [Scientific
cooperation is still an **important** pursuit despite mounting
**hostilities** and **suspicion**. [Working together on]{.mark}
**climate [research]{.mark}** [can serve as a **stabilizer**]{.mark} of
uncertainty amid a shift in the global balance of power]{.underline}.
Chinese investments in land and infrastructure and resource extraction
are viewed suspiciously in Northern European states, although
[[China's]{.mark} scientific [engagement has been **positively**
received]{.mark}]{.underline}.9) Rasmus Gjedssø Bertelsen writes,
"\[T\]he Arctic states and China have used science to integrate China
into Arctic institutions and build Sino-Arctic epistemic
communities."10) An epistemic community is a transnational expert
network that shares and co-creates knowledge about scientific problems
and solutions. [[Arctic]{.mark} science [diplomacy can build
**trust**]{.mark} and produce valuable **knowledge**.]{.underline}

China in Arctic research

[China has taken significant steps to **contribute** to Arctic
science]{.underline} through both unilateral and cooperative
initiatives. Scientists aboard China's research icebreaker Xuelong (Snow
Dragon) completed the ninth Chinese Arctic expedition in 2018 and
deployed two Atmosphere-Sea-Ice-Ocean (ASO) unmanned stations on Arctic
drift ice floes.11) In 2019, China sent eighteen scientists and Xuelong
to support marine surveys and data collection as part of MOSAiC, the
largest international Arctic expedition in history.12) MOSAiC produced
unique new oceanographic and glaciological data to fill the knowledge
gaps in Arctic climate science and allow for the production of better
climate models. [China has **established** and supported Arctic
**research centers** with Arctic states]{.underline}, including the
Chinese-Russian Arctic Research Center and the China-Nordic Arctic
Research Center.13) A joint research team from China's Academy of Space
and Technology and Sun Yat-sen University is planning to deploy
satellites to monitor the ice conditions of Russian Arctic shipping
routes in 2022.14) [By producing useful **knowledge** and opening
**communicational** channels, "science for diplomacy" **bolsters**
China's soft power and voice in shaping **governance**]{.underline}
related to fisheries, natural resources, and shipping rights for
non-Arctic states. China is already an active participant in Arctic
governance; by being a member of the International Maritime Organization
and party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, China
plays a role in the development of the Polar Code and rules of marine
research in the high seas.15) China's scientific engagement is intended
to advance China's voice as a "rule maker" in Arctic affairs.

U.S. cooperation with China

Having rejoined the Paris Agreement and identified climate change as a
priority issue, the Biden administration will likely find it
constructive to cooperate with China in tackling the climate crisis, as
many analysts call for.16) A 2021 poll found that a majority of U.S.
voters see climate change as the most important issue for the United
States and China to cooperate on -- more so than COVID-19 -- and are
even supportive of the U.S. and Chinese militaries working together to
assess climate risks and improve disaster preparedness.17) John Kerry,
President Biden's newly appointed special climate envoy, says "climate
is a critical standalone issue that we have to deal \[with China\] on.
It's urgent that we find a way to compartmentalize \[and\] move
forward."18)

Moreover, Beijing has recently appointed veteran climate expert Xie
Zhenhua, who has a personal relationship with Kerry, as China's special
climate envoy. Many Chinese analysts see the appointment as a sign that
the bilateral relationship may be productive when discussing climate
change.19) There is ample support for the U.S. and China to come
together and work on the climate issue.

However, relations between the countries have declined in recent years
and growing bilateral disagreements may present obstacles to
cooperation. The U.S. State Department has rejected China's claim to
being a "Near Arctic State" and repeatedly expressed concern over
Chinese actions in the region.20) The U.S. Department of Defense is
likewise apprehensive of China's Arctic activities. "Civilian research
could support a strengthened Chinese military presence in the Arctic
Ocean, which could include deploying submarines to the region as a
deterrent against nuclear attacks," a 2019 Pentagon report to Congress
asserted.21) However, [[there is **no indication**]{.mark} that [China
would]{.mark} try to [**match** the]{.mark} substantial [**military**
presence of the **U.S.**]{.mark} and]{.underline} its
**[NATO]{.underline}** allies [in the **Arctic**]{.underline}.22)

Arctic expert Guo Peiqing of the Ocean University of China said "[[China
will **not** send **warships**]{.mark} and nuclear submarines [to the
Arctic because it is in China's long-term **interests** to maintain
**peace**]{.mark} and **stability**]{.underline} in the Arctic."23)
Despite the suspicion and competitive rhetoric, there are several ways
President Biden can depart from the climate skeptic and insulting
anti-China rhetoric of the former Trump administration and work with
China in the Arctic, where climate change is transforming the region.
Moreover, [**[cooperating]{.mark}** with China [in vital climate
research does **not preclude** competition]{.mark}]{.underline} or
disagreement [regarding international **trade**, **human rights**
violations, and maritime security in the **Pacific**]{.underline} Ocean.
Such points of contention will likely remain with us for the foreseeable
future, but a productive competitive strategy should also advance shared
global interests.24) Andreas Raspotnik and Andreas Østhagen write,
"After years of undermining allies and partners, the U.S. needs to
re-find its international leadership ... in keeping its (old) friends
close and its enemies even closer. The Arctic case is ideal to showcase
the value of this approach. Under the Trump Administration, the U.S.
tactic of name-calling and rebuking China did not achieve much.25)

Achieving collaboration

The COVID-19 pandemic has frozen Arctic research and delayed projects,
making it critical to revive Arctic science through innovative and new
practices.26) [There are several ways the U.S. and China can work
**together**]{.underline} in this area. [[The U.S. and China should
**establish**]{.mark} a [high-level **dialogue** on Arctic climate
research]{.mark} to maintain transparent **communication**]{.underline}
on each countries' research aims in the region [[and provide]{.mark}
much-needed **[data sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Reviving
climate-related cooperation will require détente. [The U.S.-China
Climate Change Working Group]{.underline}, first launched in 2013 to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in both countries but
suspended during the Trump presidency, [may provide]{.underline} a venue
[for]{.underline} meetings and [[a **sustained**]{.mark} bilateral
[partnership on]{.mark} addressing the **[climate]{.mark} crisis** in
the Arctic.]{.underline} "[China's]{.underline} emergence as a growing
science actor in the Arctic should be welcomed but its [scientific
activities and **research** stations must be more purposefully
**integrated** into a broader **international** collaborative
effort]{.underline}," writes Heather Conley of the Center for Strategic
and International Studies.27)

[This [can be achieved by]{.mark} both countries **[supporting]{.mark}**
and participating in **[joint research]{.mark}** projects]{.underline}.
China regularly invites foreign scientists to participate in its Arctic
expeditions. For example, China invited American researchers to join the
ninth expedition aboard Xuelong in 2018.28) Chinese and American
researchers and institutions are already working together as part of the
MOSAiC expedition, each contributing to a greater understanding of the
evolving environment. A new [U.S.-China **[dialogue]{.mark}** on the
Arctic [should]{.mark} support and [**expand** such
initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}. In practice, [this may involve
[facilitating scientists' **access** to]{.mark} civilian [research
**infrastructure**]{.mark}, metadata and [**data**, and]{.mark}
protected **[territories]{.mark}** for **research**
purposes]{.underline}. Moreover, [[both sides should facilitate]{.mark}
**easier [movement]{.mark}** for researchers [by reducing **visa**
requirements and restoring]{.mark} closed consulates and
**[diplomats]{.mark}**]{.underline} working in scientific exchanges.
Such measures were discussed during the 2021 Alaska summit.29) In
general, [the **[obstacles]{.mark}** to research]{.underline} and
collaboration [[should be **eased**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The U.S. and China have a history of]{.mark} **successfully**
[cooperating in **science**]{.mark} and technology]{.underline} since
the opening of relations in the 1970s. During the period of
rapprochement, the U.S. and China cooperated [[in areas]{.mark} that
would today be [considered **militarily
sensitive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the 2000s, China rose to become the
U.S.' top collaborator in science, as measured by the co-authorship of
scientific publications.30)

The Obama administration extended the U.S.-China Agreement on
Cooperation in Science and Technology and published numerous joint
presidential statements on climate and science cooperation with Chinese
Presidents Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping. [The **[success]{.mark}** story of
bilateral climate **cooperation** during the Obama era [is]{.mark} in
part [due to]{.mark} the [**inclusion** of climate change]{.mark} as a
**security** issue in China's strategy]{.underline}, a process
propagated by the Chinese scientific community.31) The U.S. Department
of Defense now likewise regards climate change as a top national
security priority.32) Overall, [it is abundantly **clear**]{.underline}
at senior levels of the U.S. and China [that [both countries have to
**cooperate**]{.mark} on climate change. The Arctic has long been
regarded as a **peaceful zone** of **cooperation** and is a **suitable**
setting for U.S.-China **scientific** cooperation]{.underline}. "Humans
would look pityingly at two tribes of apes that continued fighting over
territory while the forest around them was burning. But this is how

#### Two Reasons the Arctic is key to solve warming: Permafrost melt releases CO2 and Methane and Black Carbon emissions uniquely accelerate warming in the Arctic

**Brown 2024.** Kay Brown, Arctic Policy Director at Pacific Environment
"Shrinking Sea Ice Accelerates Global Warming as Black Carbon Continues
to Escape Regulation" High North News October 16, 2024.

Although [the [Arctic's sea ice is rapidly melting]{.mark} with
troubling repercussions for the planet,]{.underline} the U.N. body that
regulates international shipping continues to debate rather than act on
a decision made over 13 years ago to limit black carbon emissions from
ships impacting the Arctic. [[Black carbon]{.mark}, primarily produced
from incomplete fossil fuel combustion, [is a key driver of sea ice loss
and a major contributor to climate heating]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
strongest light-absorbing component of particulate matter, [its impact
is [especially]{.mark} magnified [in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Sea ice helps cool the earth by reflecting sunlight]{.underline} and
reducing its absorption. Recently published science found that [sea ice
loss and the reduction in sea ice reflectivity has been significantly
compromised, and [the impact is more significant than assumed by most
climate models]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Arctic sea ice's reflective
effect has dropped 24% since 1980, and its cooling effect is about 20%
weaker in recent years than the 1980s. Despite a recognition over a
decade ago that black carbon must be addressed, International Maritime
Organization (IMO) member countries continue to haggle over
implementation. The IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee
(MEPC), meeting in London Sept. 30-Oct. 4, adopted a voluntary measure
encouraging ship owners to measure and record their Arctic black carbon
emissions but again deferred mandatory action to require cleaner fuels.
[Although ship black carbon emissions could be cut
significantly]{.underline} overnight by mandating a switch to existing,
cleaner marine distillate fuels, an industry representative argued that
such action is premature and that more research is needed. [A number of
countries spoke up in favor of developing \"polar fuels\" and in support
for regulation, but mandatory action appears uncertain as the process is
murky and easily bogged down in technical details and
complexities.]{.underline} Banning HFO, switching to distillate fuel,
and installation of efficient particulate filters could reduce black
carbon emissions by more than 90%. Discussions will continue in January
at an MEPC subcommittee. [[Black carbon]{.mark} is both a climate forcer
--- a dark particle absorbing heat and contributing to
warming]{.underline}, as well as a climate cooler --- a solid particle
reflecting sunlight --- but [the [heating effect outweighs the cooling
effect]{.mark} especially when released [in]{.mark} and near the [polar
regions]{.mark}. The impact of [black carbon in]{.mark} sensitive
regions like [the Arctic has significant implications for global climate
patterns.]{.mark}]{.underline} Some argue that black carbon's impact on
the overall global warming potential may be less significant than
initially thought, potentially negligible or possibly a climate coolant.
However, [black carbon emissions in the Arctic have a disproportionate
warming impact because of reflectivity loss. Black carbon heats the
atmosphere and accelerates melting, exposing the dark surfaces that
absorb more heat causing warming loops. This reduces the reflectivity of
the Arctic ice cap --- one of the planet's most important cooling
systems.]{.underline} Too many years have already passed without action.
In 2011, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe urged the IMO
to act on black carbon emitted by ships when operating in or near the
Arctic. In 2017, the Arctic Council set a target to reduce black carbon
emissions from a range of sources by 25 to 33% (based on 2013 levels) by
2025. In 2019 it called for reductions in shipping particulate matter
and black carbon emissions. The IMO's July 2024 Arctic HFO ban designed
to reduce the risk of an HFO spill will initially only reduce black
carbon emissions by about 5%. But [black carbon emissions continue to
rise as shipping in Arctic waters increases]{.underline}. Despite the
simple solution of switching to cleaner widely available distillate
fuels, significant progress remains elusive. [Black carbon also poses
significant risks to wildlife and human health. Particulate matter,
including black carbon, can cause premature death, cardiovascular
problems, respiratory conditions, cancer and adverse developmental
effects in children. Loss of sea ice can impact wildlife
habitat]{.underline} --- polar bears and seals lose key sheltering
spots, hunting grounds and breeding sites, [potentially disrupting the
entire food chain. **[Scientists have warned that keeping warming to
1.5oC or below is impossible without reducing methane, black carbon and
carbon dioxide]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.N. Environment Program
recognized in 2018 that [[immediate action on methane and black carbon
could avoid over half a degree of warming]{.mark} by 2050, [and 50%
of]{.mark} the predicted [Arctic warming by 2050]{.mark}. Such action
could significantly [reduce the risk of triggering Arctic climate
tipping points]{.mark}]{.underline} like the loss of the Greenland ice
sheet that would raise sea levels globally, [[and accelerated thawing of
Arctic permafrost that would release massive amounts of stored
carbon]{.mark}. The signs of warming in the Arctic are becoming ever
more ominous]{.underline}. The northern tip of North America experienced
the highest temperature ever recorded above 70° latitude when the
temperature reached 89° F at Deadhorse on Alaska's Arctic Ocean coast on
August 6. [Action to reduce black carbon emissions from all sources
including shipping is urgently needed to slow the Arctic meltdown and
global warming]{.underline}. [Mandatory regulatory action is
required]{.underline} because calls for voluntary action by industry
thus far have been ineffective. This is perhaps the most significant
step we can take in the near term to slow Arctic ice melt and reduce
planetary heating.

[[**Climate change** is an **existential threat** to humans]{.mark} and
global biodiversity]{.underline}, as was [[reinforced in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} sixth assessment report (1) of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(**[[IPCC]{.underline}]{.mark}**), as well as Conferences of the Parties
of the IPCC (Glasgow, UK; November 2021) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[UN C]{.mark}onvention on [B]{.mark}iological
[D]{.mark}iversity]{.underline}** (Montreal, Canada; December 2022).
[But these gatherings also implicitly highlight severe shortcomings in
how conservation scientists and policymakers are addressing the climate
change threat]{.underline}. Research in climate change ecology and
conservation is still dominated by attempts to understand how
[species]{.underline} are vulnerable to the altered abiotic conditions
driven by climate change alone (e.g., rising temperature) (2). This
[threat is **undoubtedly important**]{.underline}. But we argue that
[other facets of [climate disruption could have]{.mark} vastly greater
[impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}---in particular, the ways
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} which climate-altered **[[human
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, demographics, [**[and
economies]{.underline}**]{.mark} interact with natural ecosystems and
species. Unfortunately, these [human dimensions of climate change
ecology have received scant attention. Broad-scale [assessment]{.mark}
of the scale of biodiversity responses to climate change]{.underline}
(3) [[are]{.mark} therefore **[underestimating the
problem]{.mark}**]{.underline}---potentially on a massive scale---when
only incorporating direct, abiotic impacts. Climate change is often
considered to be one of the threats facing biodiversity, distinct from
other threats and not considered---at least currently---to have as
strong an impact as habitat loss and overexploitation (4, 5). But rather
than being a separate factor, **[[climate change
magnifies]{.underline}]{.mark}** these other [[**threats** and
is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [**[exacerbating]{.mark}** all]{.underline}
of the [pathways by which humans directly cause [species
endangerment]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fig. 1). Policymakers and planners
still do not recognize this combined impact when considering how to
abate climate disruption and biodiversity loss. Indeed, [it is these
synergies, along with [the pace of change]{.mark}, that [make]{.mark}
the current [**extinction crisis**]{.mark} unique in Earth's
history]{.underline}. Although global climate change of about 6 °C
caused Earth\'s biggest mass extinction event to date (at the end of the
Permian), this phenomenon likely occurred an order of magnitude more
slowly than what we are inducing today---and in a world without
significant habitat loss, degradation, and other biodiversity threats
from the actions of a single species. Appreciating the Complexity
Although conservation efforts have been key to slowing recent losses of
biodiversity, scientists and [decision makers need to stop viewing
climate change as just another separate threat]{.underline} to Earth's
biosphere. [[Climate change magnifies]{.underline}]{.mark} the intensity
of the other drivers of **[[biodiversity decline]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
such as habitat loss, overexploitation, and invasive species. Regional
drying is making formerly remote areas of tropical rainforests
accessible, thereby increasing hunting, fishing, and logging pressure
(6). [Warming can]{.underline} expand the cultivation zone of
cold-intolerant crops upwards in elevation, [threaten]{.underline}ing
montane areas with [**deforestation** and land conversion]{.underline}
(7). Climate-facilitated expansion of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis)
cultivation in Southeast Asia, for example, would threaten native
species in these hyperdiverse systems much more than either habitat loss
or climate change alone (7). [[Rising **ocean
temperatures**]{.underline}]{.mark} can increase the
[[spread]{.underline}]{.mark} of [**[invasive
species]{.underline}**]{.mark} (8) [[and]{.mark} make environmental
pollutants more [toxic]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(9) (Fig. 1).
Evidence increasingly shows that the destruction of coral reefs is
particularly acute when warming waters act in combination with other
stressors; plastic pollution, overfishing, and crown-of-thorns starfish
(Acanthaster planci) outbreaks all interact synergistically with rising
ocean temperatures to inhibit coral fertilization and larval recruitment
(10). [Loss of coral reefs]{.underline} can then [**cascade**
to]{.underline} harm at least two of the other highly diverse (and
economically important) [marine ecosystems]{.underline}, mangroves and
seagrasses, through altered pH buffering, sediment capture, and
abundance of shared animal species (11). In turn, non-climatic
biodiversity threats can intensify climate change impacts. Nutrient
loading and turbidity from agricultural runoff and logging-induced
erosion render corals more susceptible to mortality in the face of
warmer temperatures and more-frequent storms (10). Fear of introducing
potentially invasive species is slowing or preventing the widespread
adoption of assisted colonization as a strategy to ameliorate climate
change impacts (12); the bramble cay melomys (Melomys rubicola) is among
the first documented extinctions from contemporary climate change---a
loss that was preventable. Although ecologists have done a thorough job
of addressing the direct impacts of changing abiotic conditions on
organisms (e.g., 3), synergies between climate and other anthropogenic
impacts have received much less attention. [Millions of people
are]{.underline} already being [**displaced** because of climate
change]{.underline}, movements that will likely become the largest human
migrations in history (13). How nations deal with the influx and outflow
of [climate refugees]{.underline} will [affect every aspect of society,
including biodiversity conservation]{.underline}. Forests and wildlife
in the global biodiversity hotspot of South Asia, for example, are
undoubtedly affected by rising temperatures and altered precipitation.
And yet, over the next 30 years, they may be much more strongly affected
by tens of millions of people dispersing throughout the region after
rising seas inundate much of Bangladesh. The recent floods in Pakistan
further showcase the devastation of climate change-induced extreme
weather events, with crops, villages, and even cities almost entirely
destroyed, leaving hundreds of thousands of people destitute. How the
country rebuilds its agriculture and population centers will have a
massive impact on its biodiversity. The ongoing situation in the
Kutupalong and Nayapara Refugee Camps is an early warning of how such
processes could play out over much of the world. The camps support
nearly a million Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in neighboring
Myanmar. In densely populated Bangladesh, rather than trying to house
the people in already-developed areas such as cities or crop lands, the
government has donated forested area to the refugee camps, including
degazetting 2,500 ha of the Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary (14). The urgent
need for living space, building materials, and firewood has,
unsurprisingly, led to rapid deforestation, with the surrounding forest
cover halved over just two years (14). This habitat destruction and
disturbance have greatly increased human--elephant (Elephas maximus)
conflicts (15). Overhunting in the remaining forests has caused the
local extirpation of wild pigs (Sus scrofa), Indian rock pythons (Python
molurus), Bengal monitor lizards (Varanus bengalensis), and other
species (14). Although not directly attributable to climate change, the
Rohingya refugee crisis serves as an important example of how ongoing
and future climate-induced human population displacements could affect
biodiversity. In many parts of the world, residents will be unwilling to
accept huge influxes of "foreigners" into their communities. Any
remaining natural areas in the vicinity are likely to be targeted for
land conversion and development to support displaced persons. Governance
and funding at national and international scales are woefully inadequate
to mitigate the looming humanitarian and biodiversity crises wrought by
major displacement of climate change refugees (16). [[Climate change
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also reducing---often
**[[devastating]{.underline}]{.mark}**ly---[[agricultural
output]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} fresh
**[[water]{.underline}]{.mark}** availability in many areas,
[**[which]{.underline}**]{.mark} stresses societies and [**[increases
warfare]{.underline}**]{.mark} (17). The onset of the [civil war in
Syria]{.underline}, for example, [was at least partially caused by a
major drought]{.underline} (18). In Somalia, a drying climate has helped
fuel intranational warfare and refugee movements, which in turn have
exacerbated deforestation (19). Although understudied, the impacts of
more frequent wars on biodiversity could be considerable. Wars destroy
habitat and increase wildlife poaching, leading, for example, to the
extirpation of the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) from half a dozen
countries (20). Warfare displaces people, bankrupts national economies,
and dissolves the financial and political capital to conserve
biodiversity. In many regions, [[climate change will **destabilize**
food security and]{.mark} [access to]{.mark} natural
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Where humans turn for new resources
will profoundly affect ecosystems and species. Globally, humans capture
more than 80 million tons of marine fish per year (21). How will we
replace this protein as commercial stocks decline in warmed and
acidified oceans (2)? Increasing livestock production to compensate
would dramatically increase habitat loss and methane emissions. And
turning from fish to wild meat would rapidly deplete stocks of almost
any terrestrial vertebrate. [Warming temperatures could reduce cereal
crop yields in many regions]{.underline} (22), leading to further
expansion of agriculture, the single biggest driver of habitat loss. In
some areas, even "green energy" solutions, meant to slow the pace of
climate change, are likely to have substantial biodiversity impacts. The
growing renewable energy sector is driving the expansion of mines around
the world, and much of the increased mineral extraction is occurring in
areas set aside for biodiversity conservation. Of the area affected by
mining globally, 16% is in Remaining Wilderness, 8% in Protected Areas,
and 7% in Key Biodiversity Areas (23). Likewise, "clean" energy
infrastructure, such as wind and solar power, require large land
allotments outside of inhabited and agricultural areas, so as to not
negatively impact other societal needs. In other words, renewable energy
expansion will often occur in natural areas, as demonstrated with newly
planned wind farms in Queensland, Australia (24). Taking Action
Understanding and addressing the synergies that we outline here will be
extremely complex. There are huge numbers of scenarios for how [climate
change could affect **warfare**, refugee]{.underline} movements,
agricultural output, [resource]{.underline} extraction, and other
factors, all with large uncertainties and potential interactions with
other processes both known and currently unknown. This complexity makes
it extremely difficult to predict, with any degree of certainty, the
multifarious impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Indeed, such
difficulties could partly explain why climate ecology research has
hitherto focused so heavily on the comparatively simple task of
assessing species' direct vulnerability to abiotic changes.

1\. Knowledge Gaps [[A key area of bilateral work between Russia and
Alaska has been assessing the impacts of rising Arctic air temperatures
on permafrost]{.mark}, the layer of frozen soils which stretches across
much of the circumpolar. Russia encompasses most of the
permafrost-covered soils in the Arctic.]{.underline} The wartime
prohibition on communication meant that [U.S. scientists stopped sending
equipment]{.underline} to Siberia, [and Russian scientists could no
longer send data to their Western partners]{.underline}. One Russian
permafrost scientist noted that in his field, [an interruption in shared
data collection and analysis can be tolerated for a short
while]{.underline} because anticipated changes in Siberia can be
inferred by research in Scandinavia and Alaska. However, the scientist
said that, [[in the long term, the loss of information coming from
Russia will cause "estimates]{.mark} of changes in global permafrost
\[[to be\] biased]{.mark}."]{.underline} 2. Decline in Trust [Russian
and American interviewees alike spoke about [the value of]{.mark} both
personal and professional relationships with their respective
international colleagues]{.underline}. They recounted how [[developing
research questions jointly,]{.mark} then working together[, often for
multiple years in a row, built strong foundations of trust and
respect]{.mark} for the other "side." These bonds helped many
cooperative projects flourish over three decades. [This core element of
successful bilateral work]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [[is now in
jeopardy, as two years of]{.mark} little to [no]{.mark} in-person
[fieldwork (during the pandemic), followed by three years of]{.mark}
virtually [no communication, have eliminated the opportunities for
Russian and American experts to]{.mark} meet, share ideas, conduct
fieldwork, and [nurture]{.mark} their [working
relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Two other factors may be expected
to dilute the trust that developed between American and Russian
biologists and experts over the past 30 years. First, anti-American
propaganda has become deeply entrenched in Russian society, particularly
in the media, since Russia invaded Ukraine. Second, the Trump
administration is hollowing out federal natural resource management
agencies and scientific organizations, further decreasing the likelihood
that people once actively involved in bilateral projects will be able to
reignite their relationships.]{.underline} Conclusion & Recommendations
A lot was accomplished to understand, protect conserve the shared
environment when scientists and indigenous hunters/observers worked
together and the borders were porous. Today, climate change and
industrial activities are transforming the Bering Strait region. To
understand, manage, and adapt to those changes, it is essential to have
a picture of what is happening on both sides of the strait. As the
United States' relationship with Russia takes a new turn, there may be
opportunities to renew some forms of communication and cooperation at
the working level.

A changing menu, an altered food chain [Every ecosystem forms an
intricate weave of life that evolved over millennia. [In the harsh polar
environment, a few staple foods]{.mark} drive the system[,
includ]{.mark}ing [Arctic plankton and zooplankton]{.mark} (copepods)
that surround near-shore ice and feed even the largest residents:
filter-feeding bowhead whales. [These microscopic
species]{.mark}]{.underline} (Falk likens them to "fast food"), [offer
oil-rich, high-calorie sustenance, and provide sufficient energy to
survive the cold. In the warming northern Atlantic]{.underline}
[Ocean]{.underline} (which logged record-high temperatures in 2023),
[native phytoplankton and copepod species are dwindling. They are slowly
being supplanted by smaller, less nutritious southern species that are
shifting their ranges northward.]{.underline} Clement emphasizes [[the
potential chain reaction of Arctic planktonic species becoming less
available]{.mark}: "A shift in the nutritional or energetic capacity at
the bottom [has knock-on effects all the way up the food web,"]{.mark}
he says. The dovekie]{.underline} (a.k.a. little auk), [a seabird that
feeds mostly on zooplankton crustaceans, is a keystone species of the
Arctic ecosystem]{.underline}. These black-and-white robin-sized birds
are the far north's unlikely farmers. [Guano and eggshells from their
massive hillside nesting colonies fertilize vegetation on the land
below. Those plants then feed everything from birds and lemmings to
hares and reindeer. Top predators --- Arctic foxes, gyrfalcons and polar
bears --- then prey on the nesters, grazers and birds, including
dovekies.]{.underline} But within the dovekie's range, novel laser
technology has shown [that copepod populations are shifting from
calorie-rich Arctic species to less nourishing Atlantic varieties. [Due
to these declining and changing food sources]{.mark}, Falk notes that
dovekie parents must now fly farther, dive deeper or bring back more
food to nourish their young]{.underline}. Chicks often fledge at lower
weight, threatening their survival during the following winter. If this
trend continues over the long term, the fallout could cascade across the
tundra. [[Many animals]{.mark},]{.underline} including black guillemots
and harp seals, [[are]{.mark} also [being forced to spend more energy to
eat and raise their offspring]{.mark}. Polar cod are another critical
link in the food chain. These rich, oily pelagic fish thrive in subzero
temperatures, spawn under the ice, grow extremely fast, and sustain a
multitude of animals. They're being supplanted by larger Atlantic cod
expanding northward, which like southern copepods, aren't as
calorie-rich as Arctic species. It's not apples-to-apples when it comes
to nutrition]{.underline}, says Rolf Anker Ims, a professor of Arctic
and marine biology at the Arctic University of Norway. "Ice-linked
species are better meals." Subarctic invaders and the Arctic squeeze
[Zooplankton and Atlantic cod shifts are just part of a larger
phenomenon. The boundary between subarctic and Arctic ecosystems is
being rejiggered by the year, prompting an influx of invaders from the
south, both in the ocean and on land. Newcomers]{.underline}, like red
fox, moose, snowshoe hare and other opportunist boreal mammals, [are
starting to outcompete or push out longtime residents]{.underline}.
Grizzly bears moving northward are now preying on Arctic-dwelling
muskox. [Invasive North American beavers have constructed some 12,000
ponds in western Alaska, [altering the availability of water and melting
permafrost]{.mark}. Southern seabirds are increasingly present,
including albatrosses that soar over the Bering and Chukchi seas,
competing for food with resident and migratory birds that have long
nested there. Plant life is changing, and on the move, too]{.underline}.
"The tundra is much greener than it was 30 years ago," says Ims. [Shrubs
and trees moving up-latitude are edging out the mosses and lichens that
provide winter food for many species. [Even the largest marine mammals
are under threat from invaders]{.mark}. Iced-in areas were once safe
havens for bowhead whales, belugas and narwhals (the unicorns of the
sea), protecting them from killer whales that now foray into ice-free
Arctic waters]{.underline}. "[They don't have defenses against
pack-hunting orcas]{.underline}," says Clement. "[It's going to change a
lot of predator-prey relationships in the marine environment." There's
even speculation that orcas could unseat polar bears as the region's top
predator.]{.underline} Some resident species are responding to climate
change by moving up, like snowy owls, which are nesting farther north in
Siberia. A large majority of the Arctic's 200 breeding bird species are
migratory, arriving from around the world; they, too, are altering their
habits. One dramatic example is the sparrow-like Lapland longspur. Back
in 2017, researchers discovered the birds were nesting more than 640
kilometers (400 miles) north of their previous east Greenland range.
However, "there's a limit to how far they can go," says Falk, creating
an "Arctic squeeze" where animals run out of room. "Habitat on the
coldest parts of the planet is limited and continues to shrink," he
says, which could intensify Arctic competition as animals jostle for
position in an existential game of musical chairs. [An uncertain future
with nowhere to go]{.underline} For Arctic animals, [seasonal cues are
critical to survival, signaling when to migrate, mate, and where to hunt
and forage. But field researchers are increasingly documenting
[circumpolar changes]{.mark} that are shifting animals' life events by
days, weeks or months.]{.underline} Biologist Kyle Joly has observed
dramatic timing changes in migrating caribou in northern Alaska. He's
tracked them since 2009, capturing the animals from boats as they swam
the Kobuk River and fitting them with GPS collars. At first, he and his
U.S. National Park Service colleagues collared the animals in early
September. Just a decade later, the animals didn't begin crossing until
the start of November, a full two months later. In many cases, such
[shifts [can create a widening divergence between a species and its food
supply]{.mark} --- a timing mismatch that can prove deadly.]{.underline}
But [climate change isn't the only human-caused Arctic disruption[. The
top of the world is a hotspot for expanding industries that could
devastate ecosystems]{.mark}, including oil and gas exploration, marine
mining, commercial fishing, as well as trans-Arctic shipping and booming
tourism. The polar region is also a repository for chemicals and heavy
metals arriving from the developed world, riding on wind and ocean
currents to pollute the pole: microplastics, pesticides, "forever
chemicals,"]{.underline} PFAS, PCBs, mercury, and other persistent toxic
substances. [Many contaminants have serious health impacts, disrupting
brain function, causing cancer, and interfering with
reproduction.]{.underline} In the long term, [some Arctic species will
succeed better than others.]{.underline} Rolf Ims notes that "[winners"
in this ecosystem shuffle will likely be generalist species that are
able to cope with a wider climatic niche, colonize new areas, or adjust
to new circumstances.]{.underline} But, as climate change and other
environmental problems escalate, [[immense uncertainty remains even for
those animals currently finding success in a rapidly rearranging
region]{.underline}]{.mark}. While many birds can fly somewhere else,
[many species can't move. "[We've seen massive die-offs from starvation
or disease]{.mark},"]{.underline} says Clement. There are open questions
regarding how polar bears will adapt to more time on land and greater
competition with range-shifting grizzlies. And what [about those species
that can't, or won't, move, like sea ice-linked narwhals, belugas and
ivory gulls, as well as sea-floor creatures or thick-billed murres,
which are loyal to their breeding sites?]{.underline} No one knows what
the threats will look like, but a key takeaway, Clement says, [is that
the rate of change is accelerating. "[Species can adapt over time, but
they don't have time, and ecosystems are really complicated]{.mark}. I'm
not clear which species will prevail and where]{.underline}." Falk fears
that "[[we are losing whole systems, whole communities of plants and
animals]{.mark} ... that will be replaced by something else. It's
impossible to project 30, 40, 50 years into the future, but it's really,
really frightening]{.underline}," he says. Clement's ultimate message:
"We must quickly stop burning fossil fuels, the main culprit in climate
change." But the world isn't making that kind of progress: In 2023
global carbon emissions from oil, gas and coal rose by 1%, reaching a
record high, according to the nonprofit Global Carbon Project.
["[Everything we do now reduces suffering in the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}," says Clement.

#### Forefronting environmental protection into US-Russian Arctic cooperation creates necessary cooperation for greater ecosystem defense while also boosting security cooperation and regional stability

Arctic Cooperation [Many issues plague the growing exploration and
activities occurring [in the Arctic]{.mark}, and finding new
opportunities for further cooperation is essential. [The United States
and Russia should lead the charge and cooperate]{.mark} on three key
issues:]{.underline} Search and rescue coordination Environmental
protection Oil spill prevention and response Search and Rescue
Coordination The melting of Arctic sea ice has led to an increase in
shipping operations, highlighting the need for increased and improved
search and rescue coordination. The U.S. faces particular difficulties
in the distance between Coast Guard bases and the Arctic, along with a
lack of infrastructure and communications networks. The Arctic's severe
weather and harsh climate also complicates search and rescue efforts.
The 2011 Arctic Council Agreement on search and rescue (SAR) calls for
cooperation but does not require it, nor provide a comprehensive plan to
achieving it. The United States should seek to achieve further
collaboration with Russia on SAR coordination through enhanced
information sharing between all entities involved in SAR operations.
They should also create a working group to discuss joint training
exercises for SAR, and for establishing annual discussions.
Infrastructure development in the Arctic could also help SAR
coordination, and the U.S. and Russia should work together with all
other Arctic nations to increase investment in infrastructure.
[[Environmental Protection]{.mark} Environmental protection [should be
at the forefront of any increasing exploration and other activities in
the Arctic]{.mark}. Arctic sea ice is already melting at a rate faster
than expected, and ensuring it does not melt any faster is not only
imperative to the health of Arctic ecosystems, but also directly
consequential for its impact on sea level rise that affects the world.
Furthermore, [the faster the Arctic becomes more accessible
environmentally and economically, the more states will jump to increase
their presence in the region. In order to prevent conflict and ensure
risk reduction, environmental protection should be seen as an
environmental, economic, and security issue]{.mark}.]{.underline} Oil
Spill Prevention and Response [Melting sea ice means more opportunities
for ships to explore offshore oil and gas drilling in the
Arctic[.]{.mark} Due to the region's remoteness and severe weather,
attention to oil spill prevention and response is required.]{.underline}
In the past, [concern about oil exploration in the Arctic has led U.S.
Presidents and Congress to institute moratoriums on oil activities in
certain parts of the Arctic. Yet increasing interest in exploring new
oil reserves along with the need to recover economically from the
Covid-19 pandemic suggest that oil activities will continue to increase
in the Arctic. The United States signed an agreement with Russia in 1989
on oil spills in the Arctic, but this framework needs to be updated to
reflect the current environmental state. The United States should
collaborate with Russia and the other Arctic states on oil spill
prevention and response due to the region's remoteness and lack of
infrastructure. By creating specific training and response mechanisms
between the United States and Russia, they can increase response time to
a potential oil spill. Conclusion]{.underline} Due to [the growing
interest in the **Arctic** from many countries, [increasing activity and
exploration necessitates greater cooperation on potential
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. Due to each of their locations and
strategic interests, [[the United States and Russia should work together
to ensure that they can build trust and increase cooperation amongst
increasing economic and security interests in the region]{.mark}. While
the U.S. should also reach out to and work with the other Arctic
nations, [Russia's geographic access is a key factor, and **identifying
areas of cooperation for both countries should be a
priority**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

**China's emissions trading system is [failing]{.underline} now, causing
[record]{.underline} emissions. Adding [more participants]{.underline}
to the market is [key]{.underline} to resolving
[deficiencies]{.underline}.**

[[China needs to **step up**]{.mark} ambitions on [its **emission
trading**]{.mark} **system** [to contribute to]{.mark} global
**[decarbonization]{.mark}** efforts]{.underline}.

China profiles itself as a country with an ambitious climate and
environmental policy. In 2020, President Xi Jinping announced his
intention to make China a carbon-neutral country by 2060, while adding
that China's total emissions should reach an absolute peak before 2030.

After seven pilot projects in Chinese cities and provinces, in 2021,
China launched a national carbon market, or emissions trading system
(ETS) which immediately became the world's largest in terms of covered
emissions. While the short-term goal of China's ETS is to raise
awareness around emissions monitoring and to help businesses realize
emitting carbon is linked with a cost, in the long term, the objective
of the scheme is to provide emitting companies with a market-driven
incentive to reduce emissions from the emission-intensive electricity
sector. In the EU, the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has
helped reduce emissions from power plants and industry by 37 percent
since 2005.

The goal of climate neutrality and the plan to reach the emissions peak
by 2030 certainly surprised many, also because China has historically
never been a pioneer of climate policies. China is the world's largest
producer of greenhouse gasses -- it accounts for about 26 percent of
global emissions, and therefore, from the point of view of limiting
global warming, it is very important if and how it meets its emission
obligations. Can China's ETS play the same role in reducing emissions of
the country's energy and industrial sectors as its European predecessor
did in the EU?

A Broken Market?

China's ETS includes more than 2,000 companies which produce about 4.5
billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. For comparison, in 2021, the EU
ETS had a limit of 1.6 billion tons of CO2. While the European system
covers power plants and heating plants, industrial production plants
such as refineries, cement plants, steel plants, as well as
intra-European flights and maritime transport, the Chinese carbon market
covers only electricity production. At the same time, already in 2016,
when the launch of the system was announced, China proposed covering
other sectors such as iron and steel production, aluminum, cement and
the paper industry, i.e. the most emission-intensive sectors of the
economy.

However, [[the carbon market has **not**]{.mark} **yet
[expanded]{.mark}** [to **other industries**]{.mark}, mainly due to
insufficient quality and a general lack of data]{.underline}. While the
exact date of expansion is unknown, the Ministry of Ecology and the
Environment is currently counting on the inclusion of these sectors in
the emission trading scheme in 2025. But it could happen even earlier,
as the recent news about the inclusion of the cement and aluminum
sectors indicates. [This is because **sectoral** expansion is becoming a
**priority** due to **insufficient** market **liquidity**.]{.underline}
[[**More market participants** would lead to a **higher-quality price
signal** which would result in **more market
activity**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

However, insufficient coverage is not the main problem of China's carbon
market. [[The **EU**]{.underline}]{.mark} ETS is a so-called
cap-and-trade system. The [[permit market has a set **emission
ceiling**]{.mark} for the total amount of **greenhouse gasses** that
facilities on the carbon market can **emit**. [This]{.mark}
ceiling]{.underline} is expressed in emission allowances, and it
[[**decreases** every year]{.underline}]{.mark}. Companies included in
the system must hand over allowances for each ton of CO2 emitted under
the threat of heavy fines. At the same time, they trade allowances with
each other as needed.

Within the framework of pilot projects, even before the launch of the
national carbon market, China cooperated closely with the European
Commission and its experts on the topic of carbon markets. However, the
two schemes are far from being similar. [[China's ETS has **no**]{.mark}
**absolute [ceiling]{.mark}** [and this is]{.mark} also [the **biggest
difference**]{.mark} between the two]{.underline} emission trading
systems. Therefore, [the Chinese ETS is **not even** a cap-and-trade
system yet]{.underline}. What is more, emission allowances are allocated
free of charge in the Chinese system, depending on how much electricity
a given power plant produces. The system of free allocation also
persists within the EU carbon market. Every year, however, the amount of
allocated allowances for the manufacturing industry decreases. In
principle, European power plants have not received any allowances for
free since 2013, which also led to a significant reduction in emissions
from the energy sector.

[[Emission allowances are]{.mark} therefore [**cheap** in
China]{.mark}]{.underline} -- one currently costs around 60 RMB, or €7
to €8 (about ten times less than the current price of the EU's emission
allowance). This is a similar price to the European carbon market
between 2012 and 2017, when the system also struggled to reallocate
allowances for free. Clearly, [[the design]{.mark} of a carbon market
[has **major impacts** on]{.mark} the resulting allowance price and thus
on [the system's]{.mark} overall **[success]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
reducing emissions in the covered sectors. [If China's ETS is [to be
**successful**]{.mark} and an example of an effective policy to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, [it **must** undergo]{.mark} a **[major
reform]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

What incentive does China's carbon market offer to reduce emissions when
its allowances are allocated according to the number of verified
emissions? Those companies that are able to produce less emissions per
unit of electricity produced can generate a surplus of allowances for
sale -- this is how the allowance price is formed as well. At the same
time, China has an incentive to exempt its companies from paying carbon
border fees.

**That's causing [record-setting]{.underline} pollution.**

That said, [[it is **premature** to celebrate the **end** of
China's]{.mark} war against [**pollution**. The PM2.5
concentration]{.mark}]{.underline} of 29 \[micrograms per cubic meter\]
μg/m³ [[still **falls short** of the **WHO
standard**]{.underline}]{.mark} of 5 \[micrograms per cubic meter\]
μg/m³. To put this into perspective, the most polluted city in North
America for PM2.5 is Coffeyville, Kansas, with an average annual
concentration of 19 \[micrograms per cubic meter\] μg/m³. More
concerning is that after a decade of decline since 2013, [the
[overall]{.mark}]{.underline} PM2.5 [[levels in China
**rebounded**]{.mark} for the first time [in 2023]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This increase [in]{.underline} PM2.5 levels occurred in [[**80 percent**
of China]{.mark}'s provincial capitals, including Beijing]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, [[there is **no indication**]{.mark} that [the government is
**reversing** the]{.mark} increasing **[trend]{.mark}** of other
pollutants]{.underline}, such as ozone (O₃). Surface ozone is a
significant air pollutant that exacerbates respiratory conditions like
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and increases the risk
of infections and cardiovascular diseases. In the absence of a
multi-pollutant emission reduction strategy that coordinates the control
of both PM2.5 and O₃ pollution, the density of O3 tends to rise as PM2.5
concentrations fall. Prior to the pandemic, there had been a significant
increase in O3 concentration in China, contributing to 90.1 percent of
the rise in ozone-related mortality from 2013 to 2019. The problem has
persisted, with the average ozone concentration in monitored cities
reaching 145 μg/m³ in 2022, up by 5.8 percent from 2021.

While unfavorable weather conditions may play a role, there is clearly a
diminishing returns problem in the authoritarian approach to pollution
control. Since 2018, the annual reduction in PM2.5 levels has slowed.
There was no change in the average annual PM2.5 levels from 2018 to
2019, and only a slight decrease during 2020-22, largely due to the
reduced economic activities. The diminishing returns problem became more
apparent in 2023. Among the provincial capital cities in China, nearly
50 percent that had PM2.5 levels above the national standard of 35 μg/m³
showed improved air quality compared to the previous year. In contrast,
every city that met the national standard experienced a rise in PM2.5
concentrations.

[[A **major concern** is]{.mark} the increasing dependency on **[fossil
fuels]{.mark}**. Before the **pandemic**, China had **successfully**
reduced **coal**'s share]{.underline} in its energy mix from 67.4
percent in 2013 to 57.7 percent in 2019. However, following widespread
electricity shortages [in 2021, [China authorized]{.mark}]{.underline}
218 GW of [[**new coal power** within just **two years**---enough to
power]{.mark} all of **[Brazil]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By 2023, [China's
[coal production reached a **record 4**]{.mark}**.66 [billion metric
tons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, up 2.9 percent from the previous year. In
the meantime, [China's [coal **imports** also **surged**]{.mark} to a
record 474.42 million tons]{.underline}, marking a 61.8 percent increase
year-over-year. Consequently, coal's share of China's energy mix
returned to the 2017 level of 60 percent. In the last quarter of 2023,
China's thermal coal power generation climbed 7.3 percent year-over-year
to 1,584 TWh, [[accounting for]{.mark} nearly [**70 percent** of]{.mark}
the nation's [electricity]{.mark} generation]{.underline}. This
escalating reliance on fossil fuels significantly contributes to air
pollution. Studies show that [[in regions **failing** to meet PM2.5
standards, coal]{.mark} production and thermal power generation
**[increased]{.mark}** by 4.4 percent and 4.3 percent]{.underline},
respectively, compared to the previous year. The [[growing

1\. Introduction

To avert the worst effects of climate change, the world needs to rapidly
reduce carbon emissions. Emissions trading systems ([ETSs]{.underline})
[are a **cost-effective** policy tool for incentivizing
**decarbonization** that have been **widely discussed** and
implemented]{.underline} (Newell et al., 2014). There are over 20 ETSs
operating worldwide, covering over half of global GDP (ICAP, 2022). ETSs
are also under active development for fast-growing economies such as
those in Southeast Asia. [[**Coinciding** with]{.mark} the **increasing
[adoption]{.mark}** [of ETSs has been a push for **international
cooperation**]{.mark} in addressing climate change]{.underline}. In
2015, the Paris Climate Agreement featured 192 countries stating goals
to reduce carbon emissions in their Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDC). More recently at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow
(COP26), [[these]{.mark} same [countries **promoted ETSs** and]{.mark}
the **[international linkage]{.mark}** of ETSs as an **avenue** [to
achieve]{.mark} **global [climate goals]{.mark}**]{.underline} through
the ratification of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. International ETS
linkage stands as a promising opportunity to foster global cooperation
and accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

It is well described that [international emissions trading is a
**cost-effective** way to **reduce** global greenhouse gas
**emissions**]{.underline} (Carbone et al., 2009; Fujimori et al., 2015;
Fujimori et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). ETS linkage takes advantage
of the differences in the marginal cost of abatement across regions and
allows market forces to allocate capital towards the lowest-cost methods
for emissions reduction (Böhringer and Welsch, 2004). Qi and Weng (2016)
uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze the impact
of multilateral ETS linkage on major economies such as the U.S., EU,
Japan, China, Brazil, and India and finds that all participating nations
have greater GDP in the linked ETS scenario compared to a scenario
without ETS linkage.

However, studies have also found that multilateral ETS linkage can
result in heterogeneous economic impacts with permit-exporting countries
experiencing slight income reduction (Babiker et al., 2004; Fujimori et
al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). This is largely due to terms-of-trade
effects, which refer to effects on the competitiveness of companies
operating within a linked ETS compared to an independent ETS (Gavard et
al., 2016). The carbon price for a linked ETS will reach an equilibrium
between the carbon prices of the independent regions. For carbon
allowance exporting regions, the linked ETS results in a higher carbon
price leading to higher costs for companies participating in the ETS,
especially in carbon-intensive industries such as manufacturing. This
higher cost reduces their competitiveness in a global market where
competitors may not be subject to the same cost increase (Winkler et
al., 2021). The effects of a carbon price on trade and competitiveness
makes ETS linkage a complex decision for which policymakers will need to
weigh economic and political implications (Flachsland et al., 2011).
Further, Pang et al. (2015) describes many of the practical obstacles
facing carbon market linkage, including overcoming coordination
challenges across three categories including: mutual recognition of
allowance allocation methods, identical compliance and banking
mechanisms, and coordinated monitoring, reporting, and verification
(MRV) standards. Due to these hurdles, some researchers believe that
broad multilateral ETSs would be difficult to implement (Tuerk et al.,
2011). Rather, [smaller-scale ETS linkages with fewer participants could
be **more likely** to emerge in the **near term**]{.underline} (Behr et
al., 2009).

[[One **partnership**]{.mark} that would be [**key** for]{.mark} global
[**climate success** is]{.mark}]{.underline} that [between [**China**
and the **U.S.**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the top two carbon-emitting
nations which together account for over 40% of annual global CO2
emissions (IEA, 2021). As part of the Paris Agreement, the U.S. has set
an NDC to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50%--52% below 2005 levels by
2030. China has made commitments to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and
achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 (UNFCCC, 2022). The relationship
between the two nations has vacillated over time due to various
political and economic factors. However, [[the past **decade**]{.mark}
has [indicated]{.mark} that [**climate change** is an area both]{.mark}
nations [can]{.mark} return to [find **cooperation**]{.mark}
opportunities]{.underline} (USDS, 2021), [[and **commitments**]{.mark}
made by the U.S. and China [to **support**]{.mark} international
**[climate action]{.mark}**]{.underline} indicate this area can continue
to [[serve as **common ground**]{.underline}]{.mark}. China\'s national
ETS officially began operations in 2021. This ETS will cover emissions
from China\'s energy sector in its initial phase of operation, which
alone accounts for over 10% of global CO2 emissions (Pizer and Zhang,
2018). The U.S. has not implemented a national ETS, but regional
emissions trading systems cover major economic zones in California and
the Northeast (Narassimhan et al., 2018).

Several studies have investigated linkage between China\'s ETS and one
or two other ETSs, mostly focused on Europe or Asia. Li et al. (2019)
adopts a CGE model to show that ETS linkage promotes emission reductions
and improves economic welfare in both regions when compared to a
scenario without linkage. Winkler et al. (2021) and Hübler et al. (2014)
examine EU-China ETS linkage and identifies that while the EU benefits
from unrestricted trading, China\'s economy benefits the most when there
are restrictions to allowance trading. Several studies have modeled ETS
linkage among nations in Asia (Ma et al., 2019; Massetti and Tavoni,
2012; Li and Duan, 2021) and have found that participants, including
China as a permit-exporter, experience positive GDP or welfare effects
compared to an independent ETS scenario without linkage.

Overall, the literature shows that the net economic effect of ETS
linkage on China\'s economy depends on the structure and participants of
the scheme. However, there is limited study of U.S.--China linkage.
Gavard et al. (2016) and Gavard et al. (2011) explores U.S.--China ETS
linkage with varying restrictions on trading. Qi and Weng (2016) and
Fujimori et al. (2016) include the U.S., China, and other large
economies in their multilateral-linked ETS. However, these studies do
not include NDC updates made by nations in 2020 and 2021, including
strengthened emission reduction commitments by the U.S. Further, studies
typically consider scenarios with either bilateral ETS linkage or
multilateral ETS linkage, rarely comparing these forms of linkage.

This study takes a unique approach to ETS linkage by exploring scenarios
with both bilateral U.S.--China ETS linkage and multilateral linkage
with the U.S.--China and nations in Southeast Asia. Multilateral ETS
linkages are explored as the current U.S.--China bilateral relationship
is strained, and multilateral institutions have been shown to serve as
an effective method to bring adverse nations together to collaborate on
common challenges (Singh, 2011). In considering third parties to include
in an ETS with China and the U.S., we considered regions where both
nations engage heavily in trade and regions actively developing carbon
markets. Southeast Asia stood out as an important yet understudied
region. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a top five
trading partner for both the U.S. and China, with the U.S. and China
trading over 300 billion and 500 billion USD in goods and services with
ASEAN respectively (World Bank, 2019). ASEAN has been projected to have
the fourth-largest GDP in the world by 2030, trailing the U.S., China
and the EU (GCABC, 2017). Along with this economic growth is a
forecasted rise in carbon emissions. Without emission reduction
policies, annual greenhouse gas emissions from ASEAN could double by
2040 to reach 2.3 Gt (Sandu et al., 2019). At the same time, Southeast
Asian nations have introduced various climate policies including Paris
Agreement NDCs and carbon markets. Worldwide 40% of the national ETSs
under development are in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and
Vietnam, while other nations such as Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand
are actively considering ETSs (ICAP, 2022). Despite this prominence in
global trade and climate, there is a gap in the literature examining
Southeast Asia\'s role in international emissions trading. Other major
regions with active carbon market development such as the EU were also
considered for linkage, but the EU has already been included in many ETS
linkage studies with China (Gavard et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019;
Winkler et al., 2021). This study compares bilateral with multilateral
ETS linkage as a form of U.S.--China climate cooperation, and analyzes
Southeast Asia as a partner for international emission trading.

We leveraged a CGE model to understand the effects of varying ETS
linkage scenarios on carbon emissions, energy use, and economic output.
Scenarios include no linkage, bilateral U.S.--China linkage, and
multilateral linkage between the U.S., China, and nations in Southeast
Asia. The particular CGE model used in this study is the China-in-Global
Energy Model. We have updated this model from previous studies to
reflect the latest technology developments and climate goals set by
governments. In providing this analysis, [[we]{.mark} offer an updated
**[assess]{.mark}**ment of **[emissions trading]{.mark}** as an avenue
[for **U.S.--China climate cooperation**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

2\. Methodology 2.1. The C-GEM model This study uses the China-in-Global
Energy Model (C-GEM), a multi-region, multi-sector, recursive-dynamic,
CGE model of the global economy. It has been developed by the Tsinghua
Institute of Energy, Environment, and Economy and the MIT Joint Program
on the Science and Policy of Global Change, and was first described in
detail in Qi et al. (2014). This model has been used in previous studies
on the effects of climate policies and technologies in China and
globally (Huang et al., 2020; Li and Duan., 2021; Qi and Weng, 2016;
Zhang et al., 2017). As in many CGE models, C-GEM aggregates consumers
and producers within each sector of the economy into a representative
consumer and representative producer. The representative consumer seeks
to maximize their own welfare by providing labor and capital, purchasing
goods and services, or making investments while subject to budget
constraints. The representative producer seeks to maximize their own
profits. The government collects taxes from consumers and producers
while also making financial transfers with households. C-GEM is
developed using the Mathematical Programming Subsystem for General
Equilibrium (MPSGE) and the Generalized Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS)
mathematical modeling language (Rutherford, 1999). It is solved as a
mixed complementarity problem and uses the PATH solver (Dirkse and
Ferris, 1995). 2.1.1. Regions and sectors C-GEM divides the global
economy into 17 geographic regions. Large economies are modeled as
individual regions (e.g. China, U.S., EU, Brazil) while smaller
economies are modeled as composite regions (e.g. Southeast Asia, Latin
America). Economic activities in each region are aggregated into the 19
production sectors and 3 final demand sectors shown in Table 1. The
electricity sector is also further broken across different generation
technologies (e.g. coal, natural gas, solar, wind, etc.). Table 1.
Sectors in the CGEM. \<\<TABLE OMITTED\>\> 2.1.2. Static module Overall,
C-GEM is organized into two modules: a static module and a dynamic
module. The static module describes economic activities such as
production, consumption, trade, and carbon emissions in a single time
period. The model solves the equilibrium in a given period, then updates
parameters according to the dynamic module before moving to the next
period. The static module primarily consists of four components: 1)
production and consumption, 2) international trade, 3) emissions, and 4)
closure mechanisms. The core mechanism to model each production sector
in C-GEM is a nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function.
Different nesting structures and elasticities are used to describe
different characteristics across industries. As an energy economic
model, C-GEM models both the values and quantities of energy. Carbon
emissions are calculated by applying constant emission factors to the
quantity of energy consumed. These factors are assumed to remain
constant across regions and over time. As climate policies such as ETSs
are enacted, the elasticities describe the willingness of producers to
substitute traditional fuels for lower-carbon fuels and reduce energy
consumption. C-GEM production sectors can reduce emissions through three
methods: 1) decreasing output and therefore reducing energy consumption,
2) improving energy efficiency, and 3) decreasing emissions per unit
energy consumption by adopting renewables or other low-carbon fuels.
Trade in C-GEM follows the Armington assumption (Armington, 1969). For
consumers and intermediate use, all goods except crude oil are treated
as Armington goods. This means consumers consider domestic goods and
imported goods as imperfect substitutes and purchases by consumers are a
(CES) composite of domestic and imported goods. Imported goods are also
a CES composite from different geographic regions in the model. 2.1.3.
Dynamic module The static module of the C-GEM serves as the foundation
for a recursive-dynamic model that forecasts the impact of policies on
global economies. The dynamic model operates on five-year period
increments, solving each period sequentially. 'Recursive dynamic'
indicates that each region makes decisions based on available
information for the current period rather than maximizing their utility
over the future. In general, there are three categories of parameters:
factor endowment change, technology change, and economic structure
change. Factor endowments are resources available to a region for
economic activity including effective labor, capital, and natural
resources. Capital growth of each region is determined by the investment
from the last period. The effective labor growth is calibrated so that
the baseline GDP matches historical trends. The endowment of land and
renewable resources are assumed constant. Technology change considers
three developments around energy. First, energy efficiency is modeled
through Autonomous Energy Efficiency Improvement (AEEI) parameters that
project improvements in energy used per unit of output across sectors.
C-GEM uses different AEEI values across regions as suggested by Webster
et al. (2008). Second, cost declines of fossil fuel substitute
technology are adopted from the International Renewable Energy
Association\'s power generation report (IRENA, 2021) and the Global EV
Outlook 2022 (IEA, 2022). C-GEM considers 11 technologies to be
substitutes for fossil fuels, of which eight are expected to be used at
notable scale by 2030 and are presented in Table 2. These include
low-carbon electricity generation (e.g. wind, solar, hydropower) as well
as alternative fuels. Table 2. The eight fossil fuel substitutes
considered at notable scale in 2030. \<\<TABLE OMITTED\>\> 2.1.4. Model
updates and calibration C-GEM is calibrated with the most recent
economic and energy data for China and global regions. Trade data is
sourced from version ten of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP10)
database, which is the newest available version (Aguiar et al., 2019).
Energy and economic data from all countries are sourced from The World
Bank (TWB, 2021) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), with
additional data for China sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics
of China. Population growth, as a factor for GDP growth, is calibrated
such that GDP from 2020 to 2030 matches historical trends. The final
demand structure is calibrated to match historical shifts in economic
structure (primary, secondary, tertiary) across all nations and regions.
The emissions before the introduction of emission trading schemes are
calibrated according to the emissions projection in the STEPS scenarios
of World Energy Outlook (2021) (IEA, 2021). We used national and
regional emission trading schemes to simulate the impacts of current
policies in all regions of the model. Emission caps are set based on
NDCs. The model is calibrated to shifts in the economic structure of
regions over time (shifting from an agriculture and industrial economy
to a service economy) by adjusting the final demand structure. This is
done with a multiplier in the final demand for service sectors, which is
calibrated to match historical trends in the shift towards service
economies across regions. Specifically, the household\'s consumption
will use an increasingly larger proportion of service goods and a
smaller proportion of industrial and agricultural goods. In the model,
we scaled up the share of service goods in final consumption so that the
resulting mix of agricultural, industrial, and service sectors in each
region\'s economy in 2030 matches trends based on historical data from
The World Bank (TWB, 2019). We assumed that between 2020 and 2030, the
service sector as a percent of GDP grows by 0.75 percentage points in
the U.S., 7.5 percentage points in China, and 3.3 percentage points in
Southeast Asia. Further, compared to the previous version of C-GEM used
in 2020 to study China\'s domestic decarbonization (Huang et al., 2020),
the model version used in this study includes several updates that are
summarized in Table 3. Table 3. C-GEM updates. \<\<TABLE OMITTED\>\>
2.2. Scenarios This study explores the impacts of ETS linkage in 2030
across three different scenarios: 1) independent ETSs without linkage,
2) bilateral U.S.--China linkage, and 3) multilateral linkage between
China, the U.S. and nations in Southeast Asia. Across scenarios, nations
are assumed to successfully meet their 2030 NDCs. The independent ETS
scenario, named NOLINK, is one where the U.S. and China successfully
meet their NDCs through implementing national economy-wide ETSs without
international linkage. The CO2 emission cap for the U.S. follows its NDC
and is assumed to be 50% of CO2 emissions generated in 2005 (UNFCCC,
2022). The CO2 emissions cap for China is not set in the NDC. Instead,
we referenced estimates from the National Center for Climate Change
Strategy and International Cooperation which estimates emissions under
compliance with NDC commitments through a bottoms-up sector analysis
(NCSC, 2016). For Southeast Asia, which is modeled as a single region in
C-GEM, the CO2 emission cap is built bottoms up by aggregating the
individual emissions reduction goals from nations in Southeast Asia
(UNFCCC, 2022). For Malaysia, which is similar to China in setting
carbon intensity goals, we referred to literature estimates of
Malaysia\'s 2030 carbon emissions after meeting its NDC (Fulton et al.,
2017). The bilateral U.S.--China linkage scenario is named LINK. China
and the U.S. link their economy-wide ETSs with perfect market
assumptions. No trading restrictions are adopted on price or volume
quotas, and permits are allowed to freely trade with supply and demand.
The emission caps of the U.S. and China are the same as the NOLINK
scenario. The multilateral U.S.--China--Southeast Asia scenario is named
LINK+. C-GEM models all nations in Southeast Asia (Brunei, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Timor-Leste, Vietnam) as a single region. This modeled region is
collectively referred to as Southeast Asia (SEA). For the LINK+
scenario, the U.S., China, and Southeast Asia all participate in a fully
linked carbon market without trade restrictions. The emissions caps for
all regions are the same as the NOLINK scenario. 3. Results and
discussion 3.1. Carbon emissions across model scenarios The impact of
our modeling scenarios on carbon emissions and carbon prices is
summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 1. For the NOLINK scenario, China\'s
emissions are 10,500 MtCO2 in 2030, which is more than double the
combined emissions from the U.S. and Southeast Asia, 3125 MtCO2 and 2010
MtCO2 respectively. The simulated carbon price in the NOLINK scenario is
21.5 USD (tCO2)−1 for China, 134.0 USD (tCO2)−1 for the U.S., and 2.7
USD (tCO2)−1 for Southeast Asia. These carbon prices reflect different
marginal costs of abatement across regions, as well as the different
stringency of 2030 NDCs. Table 4. Summary of carbon emissions and
allowance trading across scenarios. \<\<TABLE OMITTED\>\> \<\<FIGURE
OMITTED\>\> Fig. 1. CO2 emissions compared across scenarios.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

For the LINK scenario, [the U.S. and China engage in carbon **allowance
trading** to meet their carbon **emission caps**]{.underline}. Due to
its higher carbon price, [the U.S. is **incentivized** to **purchase**
carbon allowances from **China\'s ETS**]{.underline} with a lower
independent carbon price. [[The **LINK** scenario shows]{.mark}
that]{.underline} the U.S. imports allowances from China totaling 1255
MtCO2. [[China **decreases**]{.mark} domestic [**emissions** by]{.mark}
an additional [1255 \[metric tons CO2]{.mark}\]]{.underline} MtCO2 [to
**generate** this supply of **allowances**]{.underline} for export to
the U.S. In the LINK scenario, [China\'s carbon **emissions** are 9245
MtCO2 which represents a **12% decrease** from the **NOLINK**
scenario]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the U.S. implements decarbonization to
a lesser degree and instead uses imported carbon allowances to meet its
NDC target. U.S. carbon emissions for this scenario are 4380 MtCO2 which
represents a 40% increase from the NOLINK scenario. By linking both of
these markets, carbon prices will equalize at 31.6 USD (tCO2)−1. This is
a 47% increase in carbon price for China and a 76% decrease in price for
the U.S. In total, [China **exports** about **40 billion USD** in carbon
allowances to the U.S.]{.underline}

In the LINK+ scenario, the U.S., China, and Southeast Asia all engage in
a joint ETS. With the highest independent carbon price, the U.S. remains
incentivized to import allowances from both China and Southeast Asia.
China is incentivized to import allowances from Southeast Asia. The
output is shown in Table 4 displays the net import and export activity
for each region. China remains a net carbon exporter of 802 MtCO2 of
allowances, 36% less than the quantity of allowances exported in the
LINK scenario. In total, China\'s domestic emissions are 9698 MtCO2
which represents a 7% decrease from the NOLINK scenario. Southeast Asia
exports 532 MtCO2 and its actual emissions are 1478 MtCO2. This is a 26%
reduction in emissions from the NOLINK scenario. The U.S. imports 1344
MtCO2 of allowances in the LINK+ scenario which is 7% more than the
quantity imported in the LINK scenario. Domestic emissions in the U.S.
are 43% higher than emissions in the NOLINK scenario. Through market
linkage, the carbon price equalizes to 27.8 USD (tCO2)−1.

3.2. Energy consumption across model scenarios

[The **[energy]{.mark}** industry [is the **primary source** of]{.mark}
CO2 [**emissions** in China]{.mark}]{.underline}, the U.S., and
Southeast Asia, [and will be **impacted** by any **ETS policy**
implementation]{.underline}. The carbon price created by the ETS policy
will change the price of different energy products for consumers,
thereby changing the overall quantity consumed. Fig. 2 summarizes the
primary energy consumption across regions and carbon market scenarios.
The historical energy consumption in 2020 for each region is also
included to serve as a historical reference.

\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\>

Fig. 2. Primary energy consumption in 2020 and across 2030 scenarios
(Lighter shading for 2020 indicates historical data).

Within the NOLINK scenario, we saw that an independent ETS in China
results in energy consumption totaling 3881 Mtoe. This represents a 12%
increase in energy consumption from the year 2020. [One **notable
change** in China\'s energy consumption is a **25% decrease** in coal
consumption compared to 2020]{.underline}. In contrast, [consumption of
**renewables** increases **sharply**, growing by 162%.]{.underline} In
the U.S., the NOLINK scenario results in total energy consumption of
1747 Mtoe, which represents a 19% decrease from 2020. The reduction in
CO2 emissions comes from a reduction in fossil fuel U.S.age, notably a
90% decrease in coal consumption. Similar to China, U.S. renewable
energy consumption more than doubles in the NOLINK scenario compared to
2020, growing 102%. This shows that creating economy-wide ETS in China
and the U.S. could help reduce coal consumption and stimulate the growth
of renewables.

[In the **LINK** scenario, [China\'s]{.mark} energy [**consumption**
totals]{.mark}]{.underline} 3538 Mtoe, which is 9% [[**lower**
than]{.mark} China\'s total energy consumption [in
NOLINK]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The **biggest
reduction**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in energy **consumption** [comes from
**coal**]{.mark}, where consumption is **18% lower** compared
to]{.underline} the [NOLINK]{.underline} scenario. [[ETS linkage]{.mark}
also [**encourages** renewable]{.mark} energy
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}, though to a limited extent (2%
increase) compared with NOLINK. In the LINK scenario for the U.S., final
energy consumption increases to 2238 Mtoe. This is 28% higher than the
NOLINK scenario and even surpasses energy consumption in 2020.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

In the LINK+ scenario, the U.S. maintains a similar energy consumption
structure to the bilateral linkage scenario. China, which exports fewer
carbon allowances in LINK+ compared to LINK, increases energy
consumption by 3% overall. The final energy consumption for Southeast
Asia in LINK+ is 676 Mtoe, which is 17% lower than the energy
consumption in the NOLINK scenario. Southeast Asia achieves this energy
consumption reduction by reducing coal consumption 54% compared to
consumption in 2020. 3.3. Economic output across model scenarios The
financial transfers and changes to carbon price resulting from ETS
linkage will affect production output for all covered sectors of the
economy and therefore GDP. Fig. 3 shows the change in GDP between the
linked ETS scenarios and the NOLINK independent ETS scenario. The
overarching observation is that the total GDP of all ETS participants in
the LINK and LINK+ scenarios surpasses GDP in the NOLINK scenario. This
supports the principle that carbon markets are a cost-effective tool to
facilitate decarbonization. However, Fig. 3 also reveals variations in
GDP impact across regions. \<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\> Fig. 3. GDP change
compared to the NOLINK scenario (% GDP). The LINK scenario shows that
China\'s GDP is negatively impacted while the U.S. GDP is positively
impacted by ETS linkage. For China, bilateral ETS linkage with the U.S.
will result in 0.19% GDP decrease compared to the NOLINK scenario. This
reduction in GDP is due to strong terms-of-trade effects resulting from
the rise in carbon price from 21.5 USD in NOLINK to 31.6 USD in LINK, an
increase of 47%. This increased carbon price serves as an increase in
cost for the entire economy and results in reduced output across
sectors, specifically carbon-intensive sectors that engage in export
activity. The revenue China gains from selling carbon offsets to the
U.S. does not fully compensate for this reduction in output. In
contrast, the U.S. GDP in the bilateral linkage scenario is 0.71%
greater than NOLINK. Carbon market linkage provides the U.S. a
lower-cost path to achieving its carbon emission goals. One key
observation is that the LINK+ scenario results in better GDP outcomes
for China and the U.S. compared to the LINK scenario, while also
delivering positive GDP outcomes for Southeast Asia. For China, the
reduction in GDP is limited to 0.13% compared to the 0.19% decrease in
the bilateral linked ETS. The U.S. sees a slight further increase in GDP
from 0.71% in LINK to 0.74% in LINK+. Southeast Asia experiences a
slight increase in GDP of 0.05% compared to the independent carbon
market. Incorporating Southeast Asia into the carbon market reduces the
linked ETS carbon price from 31.6 USD in LINK to 27.8 USD in the LINK+
scenario. This reduction in carbon price serves as a reduced cost burden
for the U.S. and China to meet their economic goals. For China, the
LINK+ carbon price is only 29% higher than its independent ETS carbon
price. For the U.S., it is nearly an 80% decrease in the carbon price.
To further investigate the economic effects of ETS linkage, Fig. 4
displays the sectoral effects of the LINK+ scenario. For China and
Southeast Asia, a higher carbon price provides more incentive to
transition away from carbon-intensive industries. In China, there are
reductions in output from the transportation, chemical manufacturing,
coal mining, and coal electricity generation sectors totaling 19 billion
USD relative to the NOLINK scenario. Fig. 4 shows that Southeast Asia
has notable reductions in output from the same sectors as China,
totaling 22 billion USD. This indicates that the transportation,
chemical manufacturing, and coal-based energy sectors see the largest
reduction in output due to increased carbon prices. Other
carbon-intensive sectors such as mining, oil refining, and metal
manufacturing also have reduced output in China and Southeast Asia,
though to a lesser extent. On the other hand, sectors with lower carbon
intensity are likely to increase their output relative to the NOLINK
scenario. China increases output in its services, construction, and
natural gas electricity sectors totaling 11 billion USD. Southeast Asia
increases output in the same sectors totaling 14 billion USD. It is
notable that while China\'s wind and solar electricity generation output
increases by only 1.5 billion USD, Southeast Asia\'s wind and solar
electricity generation increases by 5 billion USD. It is possible that
Southeast Asia\'s renewable energy sector benefits more from the
increased carbon price because it is starting from a less mature
position than China. Our model forecasts that China consumes 153 Mtoe of
renewable energy in 2020 whereas Southeast Asia only consumed 11 Mtoe.
Further, the change in carbon price for Southeast Asia, from 2.7 USD to
27.8 USD is a change of over 900% while the change for China from 21.5
USD to 27.8 USD is only a change of 30%. Fossil fuel energy players in
Southeast Asia face a drastically higher cost for carbon allowances,
opening the door for faster renewable energy adoption in the region.
\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\> Fig. 4. Sectoral value added, change between
LINK+ and NOLINK scenario (billion USD, ∗ indicates values beyond axis).
U.S. economic sectors generally experience the opposite effect compared
to China and Southeast Asia. Lower costs for carbon allowances allow
carbon-intensive industries to increase their relative output. The
sectors with the largest increase in output for the U.S. are
transportation, chemical manufacturing, and natural gas production,
totaling 72 billion USD. Sectors with low carbon intensity decreased
output in LINK+ compared to NOLINK, with the services sector reducing
output by 40 billion USD. Notably, while the gas and coal electricity
generation sectors have higher output, U.S. wind and solar sectors
reduced output by a total of 14 billion USD. This indicates that the
multilateral ETS provides fewer incentives for U.S. renewables than a
domestic independent ETS.

4\. Discussion

At a high level, our [[emissions]{.mark} results [show **similar
trends** to other]{.mark} CGE [studies]{.mark} of carbon market
linkage]{.underline}. Li et al. (2019), Winkler et al. (2021), and
Gavard et al. (2016) all show that more developed nations such as the
U.S. or EU will have higher carbon prices than China. As a result,
[carbon [market linkage will **incentivize**]{.mark}]{.underline} these
[nations to rely on **importing** lower-cost **[carbon
allowances]{.mark}**]{.underline} over domestic emissions reduction [[to
meet **climate goals**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the ETS linkage
scenarios, the U.S. consumes more fossil fuels, with coal consumption
over 300% greater and natural gas consumption 40% greater than the
NOLINK scenario. Further, these scenarios result in weaker incentives
for renewables, with the U.S. consuming about 13% less renewable
electricity than the NOLINK scenario across both LINK and LINK+. On the
other hand, [[China]{.mark} is **incentivized** to **[reduce]{.mark}**
its [total energy **consumption**]{.mark}, primarily by **reducing** the
usage of **coal** by 18%]{.underline}. This shows that U.S.--China ETS
linkage will have contrasting effects on energy consumption in the two
nations.

There is also notable contrast in the GDP impact of ETS linkage for
China and Southeast Asia in the LINK+ scenario. While both regions are
carbon exporters, Southeast Asia\'s GDP impact is positive while
China\'s GDP impact is negative compared to the NOLINK scenario.
Understanding this difference in outcome requires examining the two
primary economic effects resulting from ETS linkage. First, examining
income gained from selling carbon allowances reveals that China
generates 22.2 billion USD and Southeast Asia generates 14.8 billion
USD. This shows income benefits to China and Southeast Asia are in the
same order of magnitude. Second, examining the terms-of-trade effects
requires looking at exports from both regions. We model exports for
China as 1.2 trillion USD and for Southeast Asia as 135 billion USD in
the LINK+ scenario. China\'s exports are an order of magnitude greater
than that of Southeast Asia. This creates greater losses for China as
higher carbon prices will predominantly hurt the competitiveness of
export companies in a global market. In total then, China and Southeast
Asia receive positive benefits from ETS linkage on the same order of
magnitude, while negative terms-of-trade effects are felt more heavily
in China as its exports are an order of magnitude greater than Southeast
Asia.

Overall, [[ETS linkage **reduces** the]{.mark} net [economic
**burden**]{.mark} faced by nations to meet their **climate
goals**]{.underline}. This is evident in that the [**total GDP** for
participants]{.underline} in both LINK and LINK+ [is **higher** than the
total GDP in the NOLINK scenario]{.underline}. The total GDP for the
U.S. and China in the LINK scenario is 0.24% higher than NOLINK, while
the total GDP for all three participants in the LINK+ scenario is 0.27%
higher than NOLINK. The results from our C-GEM model indicate that the
multilateral scheme is more favorable for China and the U.S. than a
bilateral scheme, and more favorable to Southeast Asia than staying
independent.

These economic results vary slightly from bilateral and multilateral ETS
linkage results in existing literature. While our results show a
favorable economic impact for the U.S. under bilateral ETS linkage,
Gavard et al. (2016) shows that bilateral U.S.--China ETS linkage leads
to net negative economic impacts in both countries. This discrepancy may
be attributed to Gavard et al. (2016) modeling an ETS only covering
energy-intensive industries as opposed to an economy-wide ETS. Further,
in the multilateral scenario, our model shows a negative GDP impact for
China and a positive GDP impact for Southeast Asia despite both
exporting carbon allowances. This output is similar to Fujimori et al.
(2016), which also shows differing economic impacts for permit
exporters, but differs from Qi and Weng (2016), which shows that all
nations participating in a multilateral ETS have positive GDP impacts.

Several limitations in this analysis deserve acknowledgment. First, it
is limited in the scope of ETS linkage scenarios explored. We primarily
focused on national economy-wide ETS linkage without considering
subnational ETS linkages. The study also assumes that nations are
capable of achieving their NDC emission targets and that these targets
would serve as carbon caps for nations across linkage scenarios.
Scenarios where nations fail to meet NDC goals were not considered.
Further, the results of CGE models, such as the one used, rely on a
large number of parameters. Constraints on accessible data can affect
the accuracy of chosen parameters and model results. The CGE model also
assumes perfectly competitive markets and rational consumers, which may
not be representative of all real-world situations. Despite these
limitations, the study still provides a useful framework for analyzing
the potential impacts of ETS linkage. It offers insights on the
contrasting emissions and energy consumption effects of ETS linkage
between the U.S. and China, and highlights the advantages of
multilateral ETS linkage that includes nations in Southeast Asia.

5\. Conclusion

[**[Emissions trading]{.mark}** systems [are]{.mark} a policy mechanism
[**increasingly** being **adopted**]{.mark} by China, the
U.S.]{.underline}, and nations in Southeast Asia [[to
**decarbonize**]{.mark} their economies and meet their **climate
goals**]{.underline}. Were these regions to expand their emissions
trading schemes into national economy-wide systems and meet their 2030
NDCs, the resulting carbon price would be 21.5 USD (tCO2)−1 in China,
134 USD (tCO2)−1 in the U.S., and 2.7 USD (tCO2)−1 in Southeast Asia.
This study considers connecting these national schemes in either a
bilateral U.S.--China ETS or multilateral U.S.--China--Southeast Asia
ETS and compares the emissions, energy, and economic effects of linkage.
As the region with the highest carbon price, the U.S. imports about 1300
MtCO2 across scenarios. [China and Southeast Asia engage in **further
decarbonization** in order to have excess allowances for export,
**reducing** emissions below their NDCs]{.underline}. The energy
consumption across regions reflects these changes in emissions, with
China and Southeast Asia reducing energy consumption and increasing
renewable energy usage while the U.S. increases energy consumption and
relies more on coal and natural gas.

Comparing across scenarios particularly highlights the economic
advantage of multilateral ETS linkage relative to bilateral ETS linkage.
In the bilateral linkage scenario, the U.S. experiences a net GDP gain
of 0.71% while China experiences a net GDP loss of 0.19% compared to the
independent ETS scenario. Negative economic effects stem from
terms-of-trade effects, where China\'s exporting companies are
disadvantaged in a global market due to higher carbon prices. Adding
Southeast Asia to establish a multilateral linked ETS lowers the linked
carbon price and minimizes China\'s GDP losses from 0.19% to 0.13%. At
the same time, this multilateral linkage scenario leads to relative GDP
gain for both the U.S. and Southeast Asia.

[As **policymakers** from China and the U.S. **explore options** for
climate cooperation, linked ETSs **warrant consideration**]{.underline}.
Our study offers two key implications. First, we show the differentiated
effects of ETS linkage on each country. For the U.S., ETS linkage
provides a path to meet its climate goals that bolster its GDP relative
to a scenario without linkage. [[For China, ETS linkage
**promotes**]{.mark} domestic **[cleantech]{.mark}** industries
[and]{.mark} accelerates domestic
**[decarbonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [ETS [linkage]{.mark} can
[become]{.mark} more **politically [feasible]{.mark}** [should
these]{.mark} benefits **[align]{.mark}** with **[national
priorities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, our study highlights the
positive benefits of including Southeast Asia in the linked ETS,
resulting in more favorable GDP outcomes for all participants.
Multilateral ETS linkage should be explored as an avenue that may be
more economically favorable and politically feasible.

Ultimately, this study serves to provide illustrative cases of
[U.S.--China [ETS **linkage**]{.mark} that [can **guide climate
action**]{.mark} plans and research]{.underline}. Future studies can
explore smaller-scale cooperation including state/province linkage,
indirect linkage, or restricted emissions trading. Additionally,
multilateral linkage with other regions such as South Korea, Japan, or
the EU can be considered. Future work will also be needed as nations
progressively update their climate commitments and new climate
technology is deployed.

Accessed 6/23/24. ARJSH

Researchers at RAND and the Swedish Defence Research Agency looked at
where China is operating in the Arctic, what it wants, and what that
could mean for regional security. They concluded that [**[China
has]{.mark}** made only limited inroads in the Arctic, but that\'s not
for lack of trying.]{.underline} "The threat should not be inflated,"
said Stephanie Pezard, a senior political scientist at RAND who
specializes in Arctic security. "But at the same time, [they have **[a
clear intent to not be excluded from Arctic]{.mark}** developments as
the region becomes more accessible.]{.underline} The real questions are,
How much of a role do they want, and [what does that mean for an Arctic
nation like the United States?"]{.underline} Conditions in the Arctic
have always been so extreme, the distances so vast, that even rivals
like the United States and Russia were forced to cooperate there. But
the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on the planet. Sea
routes that sailors and explorers have dreamed about for centuries are
starting to open. [The promise of Arctic riches---oil, minerals, trade
routes, even fish---has started to draw interest from far outside the
northern latitudes. China has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," a
designation it invented to push for a greater role in Arctic
governance]{.underline}. It has dispatched research expeditions, sought
to establish mining and gas operations, and envisioned a network of
shipping routes crossing the Arctic, a "silk road on ice." It describes
itself as an "active participant, builder, and contributor in Arctic
affairs," one that has "spared no efforts to contribute its wisdom to
the development of the Arctic region." But in the Arctic, as in the rest
of the world, the United States sees China as a potentially
destabilizing force, with the economic and military power to try to bend
the established order to its liking. The Pentagon considers China its
"pacing challenge" of the foreseeable future. Its Arctic strategy,
released in October, pays particular attention to the risk of China
using commercial or scientific access to the Arctic for military
advantage. Researchers at RAND set out to document known Chinese
activities in the North American Arctic, which touches Alaska, Canada,
and Greenland. Their counterparts in Sweden focused on the European
side, from Iceland, through the Nordic countries, to Russia. What they
found: Especially in the North American Arctic, "there\'s not a ton
going on," Pezard said. China has invested in a handful of mining
operations, mostly chasing valuable rare earth minerals. It has trade
partnerships with Greenland and a small stake in a zinc mine in Alaska.
A Chinese company tried to buy a shuttered U.S. Navy base in Greenland,
but the Danish government quashed the idea. China has used loans and
infrastructure deals to prop open the door for itself in countries
across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. But the countries of the North
American Arctic have generally taken a hard look at any proposed Chinese
investments---and often a hard pass. Canada blocked a \$150 million gold
mine deal that would have put Chinese interests too close to military
installations. Greenland has held up plans for another Chinese mine over
concerns about pollution. "We didn\'t see the more nefarious activities
that we\'ve seen in other parts of the world, like predatory lending or
influence over local decisions, that are more damaging to international
norms," said Stephen Flanagan, an adjunct senior fellow at RAND and
former senior director for defense policy and strategy at the U.S.
National Security Council. "All of the governments are being careful in
how they deal with China. It\'s a \'buyer beware\' approach." RAND\'s
study did not include the Russian side of the Arctic. That may be
China\'s best route to greater Arctic influence. The Arctic Council, a
governing body of Arctic States and indigenous nations, suspended its
meetings last year, refusing to engage with Russia after it attacked
Ukraine. A panel of experts that RAND convened for its study noted that
Russia could seek to form its own Arctic governing council, with a more
central role for its ally, China. The experts thought that was possible,
but not necessarily probable. Despite its joint operation in the Bering
Sea this past fall, and codevelopment of a natural gas project in the
Russian Arctic, Moscow has also been wary of letting China pursue its
ambitions so close to its home shores. And rather than walk away from
the existing council, Russia has called for it to resume its meetings,
with Russia back at the table. For now, the U.S. should continue to make
the Arctic a diplomatic, economic, and strategic priority, to
demonstrate its commitment to the region and its people, researchers
concluded. It should work to strengthen solidarity among its Arctic
allies---and explore conditions under which it could restart some
engagement with Russia, such as on search-and-rescue preparedness. But
the U.S. should also recognize that [**engaging with China** in the
**Arctic** does not have to be a **win-or-lose**
proposition]{.underline}. [[There are **opportunities** to
cooperate]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[on **climate change**]{.mark}, for
example, [or **pollution** control]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China has
already [played a **key role** in]{.mark} international [agreements to
**protect**]{.mark} **Arctic [fisheries]{.mark}**]{.underline} and to
create maritime shipping regulations. On paper, at least, [[both
**China** and the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [are
**committed** to ensuring the Arctic remains a **region of
peace**]{.mark} and stability]{.underline}. The next few years will be a
crucial test. If current projections hold, the Arctic could see its
first ice-free summer by 2030.

**Otherwise, unmitigated [pollution]{.underline} will
[destroy]{.underline} the [legitimacy]{.underline} of the Chinese
Communist Party. Declining legitimacy will provoke the CCP to launch
[diversionary wars]{.underline} of aggression.**

Challenge to the Chinese State*, pp. 149-184, Cambridge University

Neither report was necessarily wrong (Beijing's smog is always worse in
winter), but the [repeated [**pollution crises** point to]{.mark} the
[**challenges** China will]{.mark} continue to [face]{.mark} as its
**authoritarian government** attempts to overcome the environmental
disaster]{.underline} produced by four decades of relentless industrial
expansion and economic growth. [Air, water, and soil
**[pollution]{.mark}**]{.underline} not only burden China with a
colossal public health challenge, but they also [[take a **heavy toll**
on China's **society**, **economy**, and **polity**. The]{.mark} health
and non-health **[consequences]{.mark}** of pollution]{.underline}, as
well as the complexities involved in addressing the problem, [[will
**test** the resilience of the **Chinese state**]{.mark} and its dreams
of global leadership]{.underline}.

Interestingly, while policy elites in Beijing and Washington debate
whether China's rise threatens international peace and security, they
all seem to take China's rise as a given, overlooking
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} vast internal challenges it faces.
**[[Environmental health]{.underline}]{.mark}** represents just one
significant [[obstacle]{.underline}]{.mark}, though it [[may be]{.mark}
the **[most formidable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In James Fallows' words,
"[environmental **[sustainability]{.mark}** in all forms [is China's
**biggest emergency**]{.mark}, in every sense: for its people, [for its
**government**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for its effect on the world."3 One
thing that is very much lacking in the current debate in the foreign
policy community is a clear understanding of how and why [the
environmental health **crisis**]{.underline} so [**seriously hinders**
China's rise]{.underline}. First, the [[people in **China** are
**more**]{.mark} **adversely [affected]{.mark}**]{.underline} by
environmental degradation [[than]{.mark} those of almost [**any other**
country]{.mark}]{.underline} (India being its chief rival for that
ignominious prize). Pollution's harmful effect on public health is still
unfolding, but already [[hundreds of thousands]{.mark} of people
[**die** from pollution]{.mark}-related illnesses **[every
year]{.mark}** and tens of millions more suffer from pollution's
chronic, debilitating effects]{.underline}. Simply put, [China cannot
**regain its greatness** in the world if its people continue to
**breathe polluted air**]{.underline}, drink toxic water, and eat
tainted food.

Second, [China's economy]{.underline}, for all its rapid growth, [has
been **harmed** by **pollution**. [Air pollution]{.mark} alone [might
cost China]{.mark} as much as [**18 percent** of its GDP]{.mark} in
2013]{.underline}. The price tag might be [**even larger** when we
consider the economic costs of **water** and **soil pollution**.
Pollution also reduces **grain yield**, requiring
**greater**]{.underline} and greater [**imports** of food]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [pollution- related [health concerns **hamper**]{.mark}
China's efforts to recruit and retain talents that are essential for
[sustainable]{.mark} **economic [growth]{.mark}** and global financial
hub building. [The ensuing]{.mark} economic [**slowdown**
increases]{.mark} the likelihood China will slip into [the
**middle-income trap**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which occurs when a country
makes significant gains in reducing poverty and building prosperity [but
then **falters** in achieving a **fully developed status** equal to
advanced industrial economies]{.underline}.

Third, [environmental [**health problems** threaten]{.mark}
**sociopolitical [stability]{.mark}** [by fueling]{.mark} widespread
**dissatisfaction** and **frustration** among the populace, a breeding
ground for **[mass protests]{.mark}** directed at the
state]{.underline}. In the post-Mao era, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Chinese Communist Party (**[[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[needs to
**continuously justify** its rule by]{.underline}]{.mark} not just
sustaining rapid growth but also [consistently accomplishing **[concrete
policy]{.mark}** goals]{.underline}. As their prosperity increases,
[[the Chinese people **increasingly value**]{.mark} good
**[health]{.mark}**]{.underline} and other things beyond basic earnings.
As a result, the gap between popular expectations and the state's
capacity to deliver promised gains only becomes wider. Under Xi Jinping,
the partystate dominance has reached its zenith in the post-Mao era, so
[[government **failure** to deliver clean **air**]{.mark}, safe water,
and]{.underline} untainted [food [may]{.mark} well [lead people to
question]{.mark}]{.underline} not only the rule of individual leaders
but also [the **legitimacy** of [the]{.mark} **political [system
itself]{.mark}**. The]{.underline} lack of accountability and
[**inability** to change **polluters' behavior** increases the
**likelihood** of]{.underline} petitions and protests escalating into
[large-scale **violence**, potentially [raising a **challenge** to the
**legitimacy** of the **CCP**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Fourth, the crisis raises deep doubts about China's claims to assume the
mantle of global leadership. Mounting environmental health challenges
testify to the dark side of China's economic growth and undermine
China's ability to market its development model internationally. The
spillover effects of China's environmental health problems and concerns
about whether China's vaunted Belt and Road Initiative is a backdoor way
to outsource pollution also suggest it is not yet prepared to be a
responsible leader in the international system. Furthermore, the crisis
joins other internal challenges to tie the hands of Chinese foreign
policymakers in mobilizing domestic support and resources in shouldering
international responsibilities and projecting its power abroad. In 2014,
a popular Chinese social media post joked that China was already a
superpower in the following areas: pollution, corruption, toxic food,
dropout students, stability-maintenance expenses, number of government
officials, number of petitioners, and emigration.4 Leading international
relations scholars, including Richard Haass and John Mearsheimer,
contend that it is still too early to view China as a global superpower
or hegemon due to China's tremendous domestic challenges.5 Their
assessment of China's power capabilities is substantiated by Jessica
ChenWeiss's research that domestic political imperatives continue to
define China's foreign policy behavior, and China's efforts to seek
global leadership reflect less a grand strategic ambition to overturn
the liberal international order than the CCP leadership's desire to
preserve its domestic rule.6

Finally, despite a wholesale commitment to the cause, the government
thus far has achieved only mixed success in bringing pollution under
control. Under President Xi, [the state has enacted **new laws**,
policies, **regulations**, and action **plans** to tackle
**environmental degradation**]{.underline}. It also has introduced a
number of new policy instruments seeking to align bureaucratic
incentives with central policy goals in the implementation stage. [The
**[state commitment]{.mark}**, however, [is **undermined** by]{.mark}
the **[gaps]{.mark}** and deficiencies [in **environmental**]{.mark}
health-related [policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as the
perverse incentives it has created in a headlong rush to report gains on
the pollution front. While the government has started to turn the tables
on air pollution, the progress is uneven, [the health benefits of
pollution control remain **limited**]{.underline}, and the single-minded
pursuit of pollution control has incurred unintended and undesirable
outcomes on other policy fronts. The limited success of China's
pollution control therefore highlights the problems arising from
environmental authoritarianism, undercuts its ability to be a global
leader in pollution control, and, more broadly, pinpoints the weaknesses
of China's political leadership.7

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

THE STATE OF THE CHINESE STATE An overview of China's evolving response
to environmental health challenges suggests that government leaders are
learning and responding, even if their learning curve is steep and they
are not yet formally accountable to the people when making environmental
and health-related policies. Policy development in China is largely
crisis-driven: PM2.5 pollution did not seriously attract the attention
of government leaders until it was recognized as an immediate and
present danger that threatened socioeconomic stability as well as
people's health. The elevation of environmental health onto the top
leaders' agenda was facilitated by a socialization process that exposes
Chinese policymakers to new concepts, discourse, policy instruments, and
best practices. As a result, the government not only has upped the ante
in pollution control but also has made assiduous efforts to improve
policy design and implementation. This sets China apart from India,
which tops the world in bad air quality. Despite having nine of the ten
most polluted cities in the world, India did not adopt a national
strategy to tackle air pollution until January 2019.8 In recognition of
the tremendous challenges of translating policy statements and plans
into actionable items, the Chinese government has focused on improving
the accountability of government officials by making policy targets more
quantifiable and transparent (e.g., construction of a nationwide air
quality monitoring network). It also has introduced an array of policy
instruments and tools to increase the cost of inaction and/or deviation
from central preferences (e.g., the widespread use of inspection tours
and disciplinary measures). In so doing, the central state has
demonstrated relatively strong autonomy in decisionmaking and the
ability to transmit pressures down to the lowest level of the hierarchy
to get things done. Despite a massive and complex PM2.5 crisis, the
state has managed to mobilize the bureaucracy and make clear progress in
bringing down the overall pollution level in a relatively short period.
Furthermore, through the implementation of the new environmental
protection law and three anti-pollution central action plans, the
government has put in place distinctive environmental governance
mechanisms, including centralized environmental monitoring, policy
enforcement supervision, and river chief systems. To the extent that
pro-environment policies in Western countries have had a dramatic impact
on pollution since the 1970s, it is fair to assume that these
state-driven measures, if pursued in a sustainable and effective manner,
should ensure the improvement of China's environmental health in the
long run. The implication is clear: the Chinese state has not exhausted
its potential and any prediction about the imminent demise of the CCP
regime would be a misread of the true nature of the state. Many pundits
and officials go further, however, contending that the country's
experience in pollution control not only attests to the resilience of
the Chinese state, it points to the superiority of the China model.
Reasoning along this line, the former Minister of Environmental
Protection Chen Jining anticipated that it would take less time for
China to solve its air pollution problem than developed countries, which
had spent two to four decades on overcoming the worst ravages of their
environmental health problems.9 Some opinion leaders in the West agree.
"In the past four years, China has succeeded in cutting concentrations
of one pollutant -- fine particulates -- by 32 percent, roughly what it
took the United States 12 years to achieve after passage of the Clean
Air Act in 1970," a Wall Street executive wrote in a New York Times
article, indicating "China's version of capitalism" is winning.10 But
such claims miss the fact that China's current resilience is derived not
so much from institutional innovations or adaptations as from the
strengthening of a mobilizational state.11 Under Xi, succession politics
has become more personalized, selection of political elites is based
more on political loyalty than on professional competence, political
participation has been neither institutionalized nor enlarged, and
functional specialization increasingly is giving way to the all-around
control by the party. In contrast to Maoist China, though, the opaque
and seemingly exclusive authoritarian structure has not prevented
outside actors such as foreign countries and international agencies from
influencing the public policy discourse, which helps make the government
more responsive to public demands while facilitating the adoption of
internationally recognized norms, practices, and technologies. Also,
unlike the ad hoc mass campaigns under Mao, Xi's China has invested
significantly in institutionalizing and routinizing policy instruments
introduced at the campaigns to tighten the grip of the party-state, a
pattern some China scholars describe as "institutionalized
mobilization."12 Does that make the China model a viable alternative to
liberal democracy? No. Contrary to what Daniel Bell and others have
argued, the weaknesses of the Chinese state are as glaring as its
strengths.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

First, [the [legitimacy]{.mark} problem [continues to **haunt the
state**]{.mark} due to its **inability** to anchor its rule in solid
**public approval**]{.underline} that places less emphasis on
performance and more on rule of law. Unbridled economic growth has
imposed significant economic and social costs. Under its implicit deal
derived from performance-based legitimacy, [[government **failure** to
address]{.mark} these costs to the **[satisfaction]{.mark}** of the
populace [can trigger a **legitimacy crisis** for the]{.mark} CCP
**[regime]{.mark}**. The hidden **fragility of the state** explains why
Xi has attached such **high importance**]{.underline} to the
environmental issue.13

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Second, the lack of enlarged, institutionalized public participation in
the policy process widens the gap between policy measures and people's
actual wants and needs. Not surprisingly, despite government commitment
to pollution control, Chinese officials have yet to unequivocally define
access to a clean environment or the right to health as a fundamental
human right, nor have they framed pollution as an explicit health
problem. Third, under the China model, the implementation of even a top
policy issue such as pollution control remains lopsided,
non-synergistic, and based on coercion. Re-creation of the bandwagon
polity under Xi Jinping has forced government officials to take speedy
action, but the unrelenting reliance on campaign-style implementation
has distorted the bureaucratic incentive structure, leading to unwanted
and unintended reverberations. Finally, the health and non-health
consequences of China's environmental destruction serve as a reminder
that, despite China's official statements on the superiority of its
development model, it is subject to the same negative consequences of
countries that industrialized before it did and is paying an even
greater price for its pollution. Such a model, if exported to other
countries, is not likely to be popularized as best practice for
governing environmental health or other development issues. The
deficiencies and difficulties authoritarian China faces in addressing
its environmental health crisis support Thomas Jefferson's thesis that
sick political systems are ultimately responsible for sick
populations.14 Indeed, a recent study conducted by Thomas Bollyky and
collaborators used panel data covering 170 countries during a 46- year
span (1970--2016) to demonstrate that having a liberal democracy matters
more than the size and scale of the economy in addressing public health
challenges, especially non-communicable diseases and injuries.15 Given
the flawed implementation of environmental policy, can China accomplish
its stated goals without an ultimate transition to democratic
governance?16 It's doubtful. Against the wish of reform-minded Chinese
leaders in the 1980s, China has not fundamentally changed the
nonscientific and nondemocratic aspects of its public policy process. To
borrow the words of Michel Foucault, the government approach to
pollution control is not characterized by "governmentality." Rather than
promote the willing participation of the governed and exercising
political power through different agencies, social groups, and
techniques, the Chinese state still heavily relies on the formal
bureaucracy and the exercise of sovereign power in the policy
formulation and implementation processes.17 Most of the "innovations"
the CCP has introduced in the anti-pollution campaigns seek to improve
top-down accountability and therefore are no more than efforts to
tighten authoritarian control. This lack of fundamental change points to
the "systematic underdevelopment of institutions of governance among
state and society at large," well documented by Carl Minzer in his book
End of An Era.18 It is fair to say that China has arrived at what
Benjamin Liebman and Curtis Milhaupt considered "the worst of both
worlds": the environmental health crisis suggests China no longer is
insulated from the problems facing industrialized countries and that the
Chinese state ultimately lacks the innovative institutional capacity to
confront such challenges.19 In short, China's environmental health
problems reveal a political system that is remarkably resilient but
fundamentally flawed. The "perfect dictatorship" is not so perfect. As
Stein Ringen concluded: "The present Chinese regime . . . is less
strong, more dictatorial, and more of its own kind than the world has
mostly wanted to believe."20 A political system that is overwhelmingly
tailored to Xi Jinping is not only a violation of the criteria set by Xi
himself in terms of democracy and effective governance.21 As shown in
the COVID-19 outbreak, it is also highly susceptible to disruption and
shocks.22

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

This is not to predict an imminent collapse of the Chinese state.
Beijing may still muddle through the environmental crisis -- as seen in
its war on pollution and COVID-19, the government retains its ability to
respond to a crisis by mobilizing resources and bureaucratic capacities
for high-priority actions and has not exhausted its potential to make
its institutional settings more conducive to policy implementation. But
government leaders, preoccupied by pollution, health, and other mounting
domestic challenges, will have to fight an uphill battle to maintain
their grip on power and fulfill their global ambitions. [As China's
economic **slowdown deepens**, so will the **tension** between
sustaining economic growth and environmental protection]{.underline}.
Efforts to avoid the middle-income trap threatens to wear away the
existing gains of pollution control while discouraging efforts to bring
down the pollution levels further. Unfortunately, the archaic governance
structure in China does not help ease this dilemma. [[The
**environmental crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[will]{.mark}
continue to [be]{.mark} one of [the **biggest
obstacle**]{.mark}]{.underline}s [[to China]{.mark}'s
future]{.underline} economic growth and **[political
stability]{.underline}**. [[The **inability** to tackle]{.mark} such
internal [**challenges** may prompt the state to act]{.mark} more
**[aggressively]{.mark}** overseas [to whip up **nationalist sentiment**
and deflect]{.mark} domestic **[criticism]{.mark}**]{.underline} in an
attempt [[to **shore up**]{.mark} its political
[legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}. What we are likely going to witness is
[[a **faltering China**]{.mark} that [is]{.mark} perhaps [**more
dangerous** than]{.mark} a [rising]{.mark} one]{.underline}.23 In that
sense, [the environmental crisis could be the **Achilles heel** of
modern China.]{.underline}

**Specifically, Xi will [invade Taiwan]{.underline} to [shore
up]{.underline} legitimacy\-\--this is [confirmed]{.underline} by
[internal documents]{.underline}.**

Indeed, the largest -- and ultimately unanswerable -- question revolves
around Xi's intentions and what he might do with China's growing
military and economic power. While Xi has not put forward a timetable to
achieving unification, he has repeatedly linked it to China's
"rejuvenation," which he says must be achieved by 2049.
[[Beijing's]{.mark} 2022 [**white paper** on
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance, [[asserts]{.mark} that
[**unification** "is **indispensable**"]{.mark}]{.underline} and "an
essential step" [[for]{.mark} achieving **[national
rejuvenation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3 [[Xi's subsequent
report]{.underline}]{.mark} to the 20th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China [[notes that "resolving]{.mark} the
**[Taiwan]{.mark}** question and realizing China's complete
reunification [is]{.mark}...[a **natural
requirement**]{.mark}]{.underline} for realizing the rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation."4 In his March 2023 speech to the National People's
Congress, [Xi asserted that achieving unification "is the **essence** of
**national rejuvenation**]{.underline}."5

Given that [Xi's age would likely prevent him from ruling China in
2049]{.underline}, the question turns to whether he has committed to
resolving this issue sooner and is thus working under tighter
constraints. [[Xi]{.mark} has [stated that]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark}
issue "[cannot be **passed**]{.mark} from **[generation to
generation]{.mark}**," which could mean that [he is **determined not to
hand this off**]{.mark} to his successor]{.underline}.6 [Xi clearly sees
himself as a **pivotal leader**]{.underline} in Chinese history, but it
is unclear how he would seek to substantiate such a claim, especially as
China encounters serious economic and societal challenges. [[Taking
**Taiwan**]{.underline}]{.mark}, something that eluded even Mao Zedong
and Deng Xiaoping, [[would **cement** his]{.mark} place in
[history]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Beyond a desire to burnish his legacy, [[Xi could]{.mark} also [be
**driven**]{.mark} by the need [to **rebuild**]{.mark} the foundation of
[the **CCP's**]{.mark} **political [legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline},
which for over four decades has been premised on sustained economic
growth. As China's economy struggles under the weight of an aging and
shrinking population, slowing productivity growth, and high levels of
debt, [[Xi could **turn to Taiwan** as a **distraction**]{.mark} from
these issues [to **rally support**]{.mark} for the CCP and his personal
rule.]{.underline}

Beyond statements of intent, [Xi's government has **increased** military
**intimidation**, diplomatic p**r**essure, economic **sanctions**, and
**disinformation** campaigns]{.underline} against Taiwan. These
[coercive activities are intended to **erode** the Taiwanese public's
**confidence** in US support]{.underline}, undermine its elected
government, and convince its people that unification with China is
inevitable and, therefore, resistance is dangerous and ultimately
futile.

[[China's growing **pressure**]{.underline}]{.mark} on Taiwan, its
improving military capabilities, [[and **official statements**]{.mark}
from Beijing [raise concern]{.mark}]{.underline} in Washington and in
capitals throughout the world [[that]{.mark} a [conflict is]{.mark}
becoming **[more likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As this analysis has
become more prevalent, so too has an appreciation for Taiwan's
importance and US commitments to Taiwan.

**That ushers in [existential]{.underline} waves of
[proliferation]{.underline} and a [totalitarian world
order]{.underline}.**

[By seizing **Taiwan**, the PRC would have effectively carved out a
**sphere of influence** for itself in Asia]{.underline} using violent
methods. This [invasion would have grave implications for
**international law**, the ideal of national **self-determination**,
and]{.underline} the principle of [state **sovereignty**]{.underline}.
[The [fall of **Taiwan** would]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**undermine**]{.mark} perceptions of [U.S.]{.mark} global diplomatic
and military **[leadership]{.mark}**, straining (and possibly
**[breaking]{.mark}**) [the]{.mark} **American [alliance
system]{.mark}** [and the **U**]{.mark}nited **[N]{.mark}**ations
System. [China would be]{.mark} viewed as **[the most powerful
nation]{.mark}** in the world]{.underline} and the primary mover of the
21st century. Leaders would experience trepidation [as Beijing marched
toward its vision of a new centralized, **authoritarian world
order**]{.underline}.

[[Nuclear **arms racing** would]{.mark} start and could easily rapidly
**[spiral]{.mark} out of control**. The likelihood of **World War
Three**]{.underline} breaking out [could climb higher than **anything**
previously seen]{.underline}. It can be expected that the world would
begin sliding toward the brink of an abyss, and human civilization would
risk being knocked backward in its developmental story. Abstract ideas
like [international law and universal values would increasingly appear
**quaint**]{.underline}, even faintly ridiculous. This would be a new
age of empires; might would once more make right.

In such circumstances, [**[Japan]{.mark}** could be expected to **go
nuclear** [and]{.mark} become heavily militarized]{.underline}. Tokyo
would likely be in the grip of a profound sense of insecurity and
disillusionment with U.S. defense guarantees. It is possible that
Japanese politics could swing [in a **right-wing**, authoritarian
direction]{.underline}. Alternatively, it is possible that far left-wing
politicians could gain power, and [Japan might end up **band wagoning**
with China]{.underline}. In either event, there would be an increasing
risk that [Japan's democracy would **erode**, and the country could
experience a wave of **political violence**]{.underline}. Over time, it
may even be possible that [Japan would become a
**dictatorship**]{.underline}.

South Korea would almost certainly feel itself being pulled into China
orbit, and policymakers in [Seoul would face the **unpalatable choice**
of losing of their freedom and sovereignty or resisting CCP
influence]{.underline} alongside the United States and Japan. [South
[**Korea** would]{.mark} likely [**go nuclear** and]{.mark} attempt to
save their nation from takeover]{.underline} by building an independent
deterrent force. South Korea [may experience an even deeper domestic
**political crisis** than Japan]{.underline}. It seems likely that the
[Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other **[Southeast Asia]{.mark}**
nations]{.underline} that are currently hedging their bets [would
conclude that they [had **no choice** but to **align**]{.mark}
**themselves** [with **Beijing**]{.mark}]{.underline} against the United
States.

[[North Korea would]{.mark} likely be **emboldened** by a successful
Chinese **invasion** of Taiwan]{.underline} and reconsider long-dormant
plans to weaken and, if possible, [destroy South Korea's government and
affect a **[takeover]{.mark}** of [the
**peninsula**]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the power and prestige of the
United States drastically reduced and South Korea acutely vulnerable, it
seems probable that [North Korea would seek to obtain China's help in
attacking South Korea]{.underline}. Beijing is likely to see the
situation as an opportunity to drive American forces off the Asian
mainland. China's government would probably encourage and support some
degree of North Korean aggression. At a minimum, an unprecedented
campaign of coercion would likely result, which could escalate to war.
At the same time, [CCP influence over Pyongyang would grow, and North
Korea would struggle in vain to maintain its **independence** from the
new **PRC empire**. [India would]{.mark}]{.underline} almost certainly
see the loss of Taiwan as a national security disaster and [**quickly
[expand]{.mark}** [its **nuclear**]{.mark} **weapons [arsenal]{.mark}**
and further build up its conventional military along the
border]{.underline}. With Taiwan gone, [the PLA would likely focus on
re-taking territories controlled by Delhi]{.underline} as its next major
mission. [[**Australia** will]{.mark} fear being encircled and
isolated]{.underline} as the Chinese military pushes across the South
Pacific. Canberra [might opt to [develop its own]{.mark} independent
**[nuc]{.mark}lear armament[s]{.mark}** program]{.underline} and
accelerate plans to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. The Quad would
be at a distinctive crossroads; it may become the foundation for a
collective security organization like **[NATO]{.underline}**, but it
[could just as easily **fall apart**]{.underline}.

A similar crossroads would be reached in Europe. With the United States
distracted humiliated by China, NATO countries might rally together in
common cause and redouble their efforts to bolster collective security.
It seems at least as probable, however, that [the **post-war bonds**
that have long tied together the great democracies of [Europe **would
fray**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Combined [Chinese and Russian influence
campaigns might succeed in getting countries such as Germany, France,
[and]{.mark} Italy to [embrace **pro-Beijing policies** that]{.mark}
drive them against the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[and **[fatally fracture]{.mark}** the **[NATO]{.mark} alliance**
network. **Eu**ropean **disunion** might follow]{.underline}, throwing
the continent into a political environment eerily reminiscent of the
1920s and 1930s.

With the PRC on the march and global geoeconomics in a downward spiral,
[fragile governments in the developing world could **topple** in large
numbers, leading to [cascading]{.mark} waves of **seething political
violence**]{.underline} and, in several countries, devastating famine
and starvation. [Fascist, Communist, and Islamist [**dictatorships**
would]{.mark} **emerge** across Eurasia, Africa, and South
America]{.underline}. Even [**Europea**n countries with]{.underline}
moderate-to-[high Human Development Index]{.underline} (HDI) [scores
might be at risk of being overtaken by **radical populist
impulses**]{.underline} driven by the spreading economic despair.9 [The
CCP would seek to **exploit** the unstable environment]{.underline} as
an opportunity [to **[rapidly spread]{.mark}** its model of
**[totalitarian governance]{.mark}**, create a global network of proxy
governments, [and]{.mark} **fundamentally [transform]{.mark}** [the
**world**]{.mark} **order**]{.underline}.

**Totalitarian governance causes [extinction]{.underline} and turns
[every risk]{.underline}.**

[A world dominated by **[totalitarian states]{.mark}** would be **more
incompetent**, more **war**-prone, **less cooperative**, and more
**inhibitive of progress**]{.underline} than one dominated by democratic
states. Our current world is not particularly competent, peaceful,
cooperative, or progressive---a totalitarian-dominated world would be
worse. [It would increase the [risk]{.mark} of another collapse and
**[extinction]{.mark}** and could shape the future toward less desirable
trajectories]{.underline} (Beckstead, 2013).

[Totalitarian states]{.underline} are incompetent. [[They are bad
at]{.mark} forecasting and **dealing with
[disasters]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).16 This can be [seen
most clearly in the great famines of **Communist China** and the
**USSR**]{.underline}, in which millions died (Applebaum, 2017; Becker,
1996; Dikotter, 2010; Snyder, 2010). In comparison, functioning
multiparty democracies rarely, if ever, experience famines (Sen, 2010).
"Established autocracies" (or "personal"/"sultanist") are particularly
bad, [[as there are **few checks**]{.mark} or restraints on **arbitrary
rule** and the **whims** and ideology of the single
individual]{.underline}, even from other elites (Svolik, 2012). From the
inside, the "inner circle" around Mao, Stalin, and Hitler seems
incredibly chaotic, with elites strongly incentivized to conceal
information and encouraged by the autocrat to squabble and feud---so
they are divided (Conquest, 1992; Kershaw, 2008; Zhang & Halliday,
2006). [If totalitarian states are worse at addressing social,
environmental, and technological problems, then a world dominated by
them would likely be **worse at responding** to risks of collapse and
**extinction**]{.underline}.

[A world dominated by totalitarian states is more likely to have **major
wars**]{.underline}. States with near-universal adult suffrage rarely
(if ever) go to war with one another (Barnhart et al., 2020), so a world
dominated by democracies has fewer wars. [**[Miscalc]{.mark}ulation**
[might be a]{.mark} particular [problem]{.mark} for totalitarian states
[due to **personalization** and disincentives for **accurate
info**]{.mark}**rmation**, leading to well-known **strategic
disasters**]{.underline} such as Hitler and Stalin's blunders in World
War II (Bialer, 1970; Noakes & Pridham, 2001), or at a smaller level,
Saddam Hussein's rejection of diplomacy (Atkinson, 1993). War makes
collapse and extinction more likely, by [[raising the chance of]{.mark}
**[w]{.mark}**]{.underline}eapons of **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction [being used]{.underline}.

Linked to this, [[totalitarian states are **less cooperative**]{.mark}
than democratic states]{.underline}. While cooperation is possible
(Ginsburg, 2020), their [internal norms are characterized by
**[paranoia]{.mark}** and [**treachery**, and]{.mark} their **[lack of
transparency]{.mark}** limits their ability to **credibly
commit**]{.underline} to agreements. [This [is bad for all
risks]{.mark}]{.underline} that require cooperation [such as
**pandemics** or **climate change**]{.underline} (Tomasik, 2015).

Finally, continued [social and scientific progress is likely to **reduce
risks**]{.underline} of collapse and extinction. Social progress could
[reduce global **inequality** and other risk factors]{.underline}.
[[Scientific progress could]{.mark} help [address]{.mark} natural risks
and [**climate** change]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sandberg, 2018),
[differentially increase **defensive** rather than offensive
power]{.underline} (Garfinkel & Dafoe, 2019), [[and solve]{.mark} safety
challenges in **[AI or biotech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline} (Russell,
2019). However, as we will now discuss [totalitarian states would likely
**inhibit social progress**]{.underline}.

A central question from a longtermist perspective is: Which values
should shape the future? I would argue that we should prefer it to be
shaped by liberal democratic values. This is not to say that the current
democracy-dominated world is perfect---far from it. The fate of billions
of factory-farmed animals or hundreds of millions of people in extreme
poverty makes that abundantly clear. However, democracies have two
advantages. First, democracies have space for cosmopolitan values such
as human rights, plurality, freedom, and equality. These are better than
those that characterize life under totalitarianism: Fear, terror,
subjection, and secrecy. Second, they have within themselves the
mechanism to allow progress. In the last 100 (or even 50) years, the
lives of women, LGBT people, religious minorities, and non-white people
have dramatically improved. Our "moral circle" has expanded, and could
continue to expand (Singer, 1981). The arc of the moral universe is
long, but given the right conditions, it might just bend toward justice
(King, 1968). A global society dominated by these values, and with the
possibility of improving more, has a better longterm potential. A
totalitarian-dominated world, on the other hand, would reduce the space
for resistance and progress---distorting the human trajectory.

[We should be particularly concerned about
"**bottlenecks**"]{.underline} at which values are particularly
important---[where there is a risk of "**locking-in**"]{.underline} some
particular set of (possibly far from optimal) values. While they are
currently far-off, [**future technologies** such as artificial general
intelligence, space settlement, life extension]{.underline} (of
autocrats), [or much better surveillance could **enable
lock-in**]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).17

Conditional on them avoiding new catastrophes, world orders dominated by
totalitarians could be quite long-lasting (Caplan, 2008). Democracies
can undermine authoritarian and totalitarian regimes through the
following ways: Control, including conquest; contagion through
proximity; and consent, promoting receptivity toward democratization
(Whitehead, 2001). Democracies can actively undermine these regimes
through war, sanctions, hosting rebellious exiles, or sponsoring
internal movements. Passively, through contagion, they offer a
demonstration that a better, more prosperous life is possible. For
example, in the final years of the USSR, ordinary Soviet citizens were
able to see that the West had a higher standard of living---more
innovation, more choice, and more consumer goods. The elites were able
to read books from the outside, and travel---Gorbachev's contacts and
friendships with European politicians may have made him more favorable
to social democracy (Brown, 1996). Democracies can undermine the will
and capacity of the coercive apparatus (Bellin, 2004). However, in a
world not dominated by democracies, all these pressures would be far
less.

A world in which, say, [**totalitarian** regimes]{.underline} emerged as
dominant after World War II (for example if the USA was defeated) [could
be **self-reinforcing** and long-lasting]{.underline}, like the
self-reinforcing relationship of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia (Orwell,
1949). Orwell's fictional world is characterized by constant low-grade
warfare to justify emergency powers and secure elites, and with shifting
alliances of convenience as states bandwagon and balance, thereby
preventing any resolution. [A totalitarian-dominated world order could
be rather robust, perhaps for **decades or even
centuries**.]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} long-lasting **[totalitarian]{.mark}-dominated
[world]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} extend]{.underline} the period of time
humanity would spend with a [heightened [risk]{.mark} of [collapse or
**extinction**, as well as increased]{.mark} potential for
**[distortion]{.mark}** of the human trajectory]{.underline} and the
possibility that a "lock-in" event may occur. This example illustrates
the possibility of a "negative recovery," resulting in a trajectory with
less or no scientific and social progress and a less favorable
geopolitical situation, [[which would **threaten**]{.mark} the
destruction of humanity's **[longterm potential]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

## Science Diplomacy Advantage

### 2AC -- US led Multilateral Cooperation Key

#### The plan is key to reinvigorating global disease mitigation efforts -- multilateral cooperation is required

Juan Manuel **Santos** (a former President of Colombia, and a Nobel
Peace Prize laureate) "Countries are neglecting the existential threat
of pandemics. Bold leadership is necessary" January 30, **2025**
https://thebulletin.org/2025/01/countries-are-neglecting-the-existential-threat-of-pandemics-bold-leadership-is-necessary/ -
Date Accessed -- 07/01/2025//KSH

On the fifth anniversary of COVID-19 being declared a public health
emergency of international concern, we face growing risks of even worse
pandemics. But the world is not ready to respond. Leaders have not
learned the lessons from COVID and other recent pandemics. Why not?
[[Pandemics are]{.underline}]{.mark} one of several [[existential
threats]{.mark}]{.underline} facing us all, such as climate change
[and]{.mark} habitat and biodiversity loss (the "nature crisis");
nuclear weapons; and unregulated artificial intelligence (AI), all of
which could kill millions or even billions of people and destroy the
livelihoods and way of life of many more. [These threats [demand global
solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline} and strong political will [[to
find]{.mark} common [solutions]{.mark} based on science]{.underline},
analysis, and long-term thinking about how to keep our planet safe for
everyone. Instead, we are witnessing a resurgence of isolationism,
populism, and short-term thinking. Along with the executive order
freezing foreign aid, President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the
United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) is particularly
alarming. No country can manage a global pandemic on its own or ignore
the risks of one breaking out elsewhere in the world[. [Viruses do not
respect national borders]{.mark}]{.underline} or political ideologies.
They spread quickly across the world. [The world needs to work
together]{.underline} to contain them. The WHO plays a vital role in
that. Leaders are failing to act with sufficient urgency and ambition in
the face of current and future threats, partly because they are not
learning the lessons from past crises. As the Spanish-American
philosopher George Santayana wrote over a hundred years ago: "Those who
cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." These words rang
in my mind as I helped unveil the Doomsday Clock in Washington DC this
week. The Clock's hands were moved forward to 89 seconds to midnight --
signifying that we are at the closest point to destroying our world
since the Clock's creation in 1947. The decision to move the Clock's
hands forward reflects both the severity of the existential threats
facing humanity, and the weakness of political leadership on the global
stage. Pandemics are a case in point. Too few leaders have learned the
critical lesson that [[international cooperation is essential to
pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response]{.underline}.]{.mark} A
cycle of panic and neglect has historically characterized the politics
of pandemics. We are back in the neglect phase. When the Elders (a group
of former world leaders I am honored to chair) commissioned a global
public opinion survey in 2024, we found people all over the world see
the pandemic threat as a lower risk than other existential threats, with
only 34 percent of respondents thinking it will grow in future. The vast
majority of pandemic scientists think otherwise. The survey also showed
most people believe that, after the experience of COVID, leaders will
know what to do next time. Unfortunately, this may be little more than
wishful thinking. Nations working effectively together is essential to
managing the risks of invisible pathogens that spread around the world
freely, but that is not what appears to be happening. The world is at
risk of reducing its support for the WHO, at a time when its essential
role in coordinating global efforts on disease surveillance, resilience,
and emergency response, is needed more than ever; countries must defend
the organization's indispensable mandate to promote and safeguard global
health. And other critical global health institutions are also at risk,
including the Pandemic Fund and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief, or PEPFAR. This all as naturally occurring disease outbreaks are
becoming more prevalent, exacerbated by the climate and environmental
crisis. Pandemic neglect is inexcusable given the lessons from COVID and
the current spate of infectious disease outbreaks, including mpox and
Marburg. Of grave concern is the possibility that the devasting H5N1
avian influenza outbreak in birds, cattle, and other species could turn
into a full-blown human pandemic. Meanwhile, [[the fast pace of
scientific development]{.underline}]{.mark}--including
AI--[[offers]{.mark} significant [opportunities for]{.mark} progress
with vaccines and [cures]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Yet without
appropriate regulation, AI in the wrong hands could produce a
bioengineered pathogen leading to a catastrophic new disease outbreak
far worse in scale than COVID. We lack sufficient global agreement on
professional norms, codes of ethics, and standard operating procedures
to manage growing biosecurity risks. COVID killed millions around the
world (with some countries in my continent of Latin America particularly
badly hit) and wiped trillions from the global economy. But people want
to forget about it. That is understandable for individuals, but not the
governments that we are relying on to have learned and applied the
lessons from this catastrophe. People also want to hope that there won't
be another pandemic any time soon. But responsible politicians cannot
base their policies just on hope. They need to take account of science
and evidence. The Elders are hugely concerned about the piecemeal,
reactive approach to infectious disease outbreaks and the lack of
attention being paid to this risk at the global level by our leaders.
They are symptoms of [the broader malaise in
[multilateral]{.mark}ism]{.underline} and national leadership, and
specific threats to global health security, exacerbated by the virulent
movement of misinformation and disinformation about pandemics and
particularly vaccines. This is why, today, we published a new paper on
pandemics, which identifies six areas for [[action]{.underline}]{.mark}:
international attention and global leadership; a whole of society
approach; equity, human rights and global solidarity; sustainable
financing; disinformation and politicization; and the threats and
opportunities of new technologies. This agenda requires strong political
leadership from heads of state and government. It also calls for
policies that consider the needs of all parts of society, in all
countries around the world. It [is]{.mark} the nature of pandemics that
none of us are safe until all of us are safe. [[Preventing and preparing
for pandemics]{.mark} is a collective]{.underline} action
[problem]{.underline}.

climate research program on the planet, IPY-5 offers an unparalleled
opportunity to coalesce around a shared vision of not just the polar
regions but our deeply interconnected planet, as the global community
faces unprecedented intergenerational social and environmental
challenges. As conceived by Inupiaq scholar Dr. Margaret Rudolf and
Russian geographer Dr. Andrey Petrov, IPY-5 should be jointly prepared
as "Indigenous People's Year" to draw together the realms of scientific
problem solving and investigation and Indigenous and social scientific
approaches to relationship, knowledge, and actionable science.

The prevailing evidence suggests a pronounced divergence between
geopolitical and chronopolitical viewpoints. It is therefore salient
that states and institutions responsible for scientific cooperation do
not overlook the temporalities of the climate crisis in favor of a
predominantly short-term political perspective. As the case of
permafrost illustrates, this paradigm hinders effective international
collaboration on significant environmental issues, and in response, [[it
is essential to safeguard]{.mark} climate [science from geopolitical
interferences]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the context of this crisis of
temporality, [[the ongoing geopolitical upheaval underscores the urgency
of science diplomacy to transcend the prevailing U.S.-China systemic
rivalry in the polar regions]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Given the
interconnectedness of international security affairs and climate change,

### 2AC - Russia Says Yes

#### The United States canceled its scientific exploration of the Russian Arctic after the invasion of Ukraine but Russia is ready to return

Irina Panyushkina is a dendrochronologist --- a scientist who studies
tree-ring dating to understand past environmental conditions --- at the
University of Arizona. In early 2022 she was planning to do summer
fieldwork in Siberia, for her research on the links between climate
change, Russia's freshwater systems and Arctic ice formation. Her work
had already been delayed years by Covid-19. Then Russia invaded Ukraine,
and it slammed to a halt again. Dmitry [Nicolsky, a geophysicist at the
University of Alaska]{.underline} at Fairbanks [who researches thawing
Arctic permafrost, managed to stay in touch with some of his
Russia-based colleagues as the war started to unfold. But over time that
contact stopped, and with it key information-sharing]{.underline}.
Florian Stammler, an anthropologist at the University of Lapland in
Finland, was unable after the invasion to return to Russia's Sakha
republic in northeastern Siberia, where he'd long been measuring the
impact of global warming on the nomadic, reindeer-herding Nenets people.
These projects represent a small fraction of the Arctic climate research
that's been derailed by the war in Ukraine. Studying the fast-warming
top of the planet is crucial to efforts to mitigate global warming and
understand its dynamics at lower latitudes. Arctic climate scientists
tend to be a close-knit community, as normal professional rivalries are
flattened by the borderless, existential threat of climate change. But
the war upended that status quo: Now geopolitics are a main determinant
of whether scientific projects can move forward. Most EU and
[NATO]{.underline} member [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} have
suspended or [[sharply limited funding for scholarly work
involving]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia, a country that holds roughly
[[half of the world's Arctic territory]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Sharing
data is]{.underline}]{.mark} largely [[banned and the limited
communication]{.mark} [that's still possible]{.mark} is
nerve-wracking]{.underline}, [as former scientific colleagues worry
about [jeopardizing]{.mark} each others' [careers]{.mark} or
safety.]{.underline} Finding ways to restart stalled science will be a
recurring topic of conversation at a major Arctic conference in Iceland
this week, where for the second year in a row, Russian scientists will
not be present. Asia will play an increasingly pivotal role in the
Arctic, having heavily invested in polar science capabilities in recent
years, said Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, former president of Iceland and the
conference's chairperson, in an interview on the eve of the gathering.
"Japan, Korea and China have modernized their research vessels with ice
capability more than any other country in the world in the last five to
10 years," Grimsson said. A fundamental question for delegates to
consider is whether "meaningful Arctic science" and "meaningful global
climate science" can be done at all without access to data from Russia's
Arctic, Grímsson said. [Nicolsky's research on permafrost has been
supported by [the National Science Foundation]{.mark}]{.underline}
(NSF), [one of the major American bodies that [stopped funding new
projects involving Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} under White House
guidelines. [**The NSF also pulled out of** most existing
projects]{.underline}, unless they could be adjusted to focus on
non-Russian parts of the region. (A European Commission decision had a
similar impact on European funding.) The project involved collecting
temperature readings from more than 250 permafrost monitoring sites in
Russia, Alaska and Canada, and mapping key changes. Arctic permafrost is
estimated to hold 1,700 billion metric tons of frozen and thawing
organic carbon, at least twice what's already in the Earth's atmosphere.
As it thaws, that gas is released, accelerating warming, which in turn
speeds up thawing in a dangerous cycle. Most of the planet's permafrost
lies within Russia and Nicolsky was relying on Russian colleagues to
collect that data. "We cannot remove this piece from the equation," he
says. "[[It's like **removing a couple of wheels from a car and trying
to drive it home**]{.underline}."]{.mark} He's spent hours poring over
legal documents, trying to find a clear path to continue working
together. [While the NSF did not withdraw funding, Nicolsky's
collaborators in Russia are unsure whether it's safe to accept it, or
even to communicate with US-based scientists]{.underline}. Last year he
was still able to receive some data out of Russia, "but this year it was
just gridlock," he says. "I spent countless meetings trying to
facilitate collaboration with our Russian colleagues, to find different
means, and it was falling apart from both ends, on the Russian side and
on the US side." A fractured Arctic Council It's not just communication
breakdowns. Nicolsky adds that [[the logistics system underpinning
Arctic research --- helping scientists ship equipment across borders and
facilitating visas --- is]{.mark} fundamentally
["broken]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark} Much of that kind of support
had been provided by the Arctic Council, a pan-governmental group of
Arctic nations formed in 1996 that includes Russia. A week after the
invasion of Ukraine, it suspended all activities. The Council had been a
critically important body for bringing states and Indigenous groups
together on Arctic issues, leading to legally binding agreements on
matters such as scientific cooperation, search and rescue operations and
marine pollution. Prior to the war in Ukraine, a Council working group
was studying a possible pan-Arctic agreement to fight and prevent
wildfires, of the kind that tore through Siberia and Canada in recent
years. That and other work has gradually resumed, though not at the
normal speed or level, says Morten Hoglund, the Norwegian chair of the
Council. Since his country assumed the rotating position from Russia in
May, Hoglund has worked to find a way to unstick the body, which
operates by consensus. A decision in August to allow member countries to
communicate in writing, without having to meet, is an important step
toward easing logjams and eventually allowing a few key projects to move
forward. Still, the Council is not yet in a position to approve new
projects, and even if they were, "there are layers of challenges, not
only political but also practical," that discourage collaboration with
Russia, he says. "We have to be realistic." [[Progress
will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[depend]{.mark} more [on the
willingness of]{.mark} the Council's Western [nations to engage]{.mark}
with [Russia]{.mark} than the other way around,]{.underline} says
Jennifer Spence, a public policy expert with Harvard University's Arctic
Initiative. "[[It **wasn't Russia blocking anything**,]{.mark} it was
the]{.underline} seven [other]{.underline} like-minded
[state]{.underline}s," she says of the Council's paralysis. "In many
ways, [[Russia has been ready to come to the table from day one]{.mark}
and been pretty open about the fact that they wanted the Arctic Council
to continue to function]{.underline}."

A legal obligation. [[The 2017 Agreement]{.mark} on Enhancing

[[recognised]{.mark} in their Agreement the importance of [constructive

Arctic (preambular paragraphs 1 and 2); reiterated the urgent need for
increased actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change (preambular

Moreover, [in order to achieve said enhanced cooperation]{.underline},
the [states [parties entered into]{.mark}]{.underline} a number of
[[commitments]{.underline},]{.mark} including to facilitate the entry
and exit of persons and equipment involved in scientific activities
(Article 4), as well as access to research infrastructure and facilities
(Article 5), research areas (Article 6) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} data
(Article 7). These commitments [[are legally

the Agreement, and 19(3) for automatic renewal after its initial
five-year validity unless a party announces its withdrawal from it.
Also, any party may withdraw via written notification (Article 19(4)).
However, since these provisions have not been triggered, [[the Agreement

altered the geopolitical landscape, and rendered various forms of

Understanding Russia's aspirations in the Arctic. [[A key to]{.mark}
navigating [future collaboration on emerging
diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} and other health risks [in the Arctic
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} a deeper understanding of the future
[[Russia]{.underline} s]{.mark}ees for itself as a leading power in the
region. Russia controls about 45% of the geographic territory of the
Arctic, including the Northern Sea Route---which is in Russia's
exclusive economic zone---a particularly useful seaway for moving cargo
between the North Pacific region and Northern Europe. [Russia's position
in the Arctic]{.underline} and its role in current geopolitical crises
[contribute to broader debates on]{.underline} the effectiveness of
"soft law" (such as recommendations and codes of conduct) and
[diplomacy]{.underline} in various areas [of international scientific
cooperation]{.underline}, particularly for health and climate issues.
Already, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine
have shifted Russian foreign policy approaches to health and science
deeper into the security realm. The invasion prompted many [[Western
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[impose]{.mark} a range of
[scientific sanctions on Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [though
individual researchers are not banned]{.underline} from cross-border
collaboration, travel between Russia and the West is more complicated.
[The number of [research collaborations]{.mark} between Russian
scientists and those from the United States]{.underline} and European
countries [[has fallen]{.underline}]{.mark}, as has the attendance of
Russian researchers at international academic conferences. A year into
the war with Ukraine, Russian president Vladimir Putin presented a new
Foreign Policy Concept (FPC), an outline of Russia's national interests,
strategic goals, challenges, and main directions of foreign policy,
which had last been updated in 2016. The new [FPC
emphasizes]{.underline} Arctic policy in commitments to "counteracting
the unfriendly states' policy aimed at militarization of the region" and
["[establishing a mutually beneficial cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}
with the non-Arctic states pursuing a constructive policy toward
Russia." These statements signal Russia's strategic interest in
maintaining a formal presence on the Arctic Council to preserve its
political power in the Arctic while testing new bilateral partnerships
in the region. Global [health priorities]{.underline} in the FPC
[suggest [Russia's continuing interest in international]{.mark}
discussions]{.underline}, but with variations in focus across regions.
The document links global health to [[environmental
protection]{.underline}]{.mark} and climate change, and **[[goals
include "increasing efficiency of international
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the area of health care and
preventing its politicization," [[as well as "**consolidating
international efforts in order to prevent the extension of dangerous
infectious diseases**]{.mark}"]{.underline} and quickly responding to
crises, epidemics, and pandemics. Russia remains a member of the World
Health Organization (WHO) and is active in convenings related to WHO's
International Health Regulations and the pandemic accord led by its
Intergovernmental Negotiating Body. As geopolitical and military
instability abuts nonmilitary humanitarian pursuits, Arctic states may
be forced to allocate resources to protecting individual interests over
supporting scientific cooperation. However, in other periods of
tension[, [science diplomacy has been key to preserving cooperation
between allies and rivals]{.mark}]{.underline}, as with the Pugwash
Conferences on Science and World Affairs, the Edinburgh Conversations,
Cold War--era polio vaccine cooperation, and the international effort to
sequence SARS-CoV-2. [[With the Arctic region in a precarious position,
now may be the time to]{.mark}]{.underline} move beyond traditional
forms of diplomacy and [[center the pursuit of alternative means of
scientific cooperation around]{.mark}]{.underline} health and climate
security as a unifying purpose for continued engagement. An important
component of any effective [[international science
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} is the personal relationships
cultivated between scientists from around the world, often nurtured over
decades. To preserve those relationships under an Arctic Council with
diminished capacity, [we recommend Western policymakers and other
stakeholders engage [in bilateral initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}
extending beyond the Arctic Council framework.

#### Plan key to solve catastrophic disease spread

The scientific imperative. [[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} is
experiencing unprecedented environmental changes, including melting sea
ice, permafrost thaw, and shifts in ecosystems. Temperatures in the
region continue to rise at four times the global annual average
(Rantanen et al. 2022). These transformations [[directly affect the
entire globe]{.underline}]{.mark} and therefore require urgent and
global responses. The international scientific community has not been
immune to recent geopolitical tensions, with Western countries and
Russia introducing reciprocal bans on joint research and scientific
projects. There are notable exceptions, including continuing cooperation
on fisheries, but these are relatively few. While important scientific
research continues in the Russian Arctic, this too is under threat as
sanctions reduce access to Western technology. Of course, the
environmental problems of the Arctic do not recede when there is a break
in international collaboration - if anything they accelerate.
Accordingly, it is important to consider ways to 'compartmentalise'
scientific/environmental issues from hot security issues. The former are
urgent for the globe, not just the region, and they are sometimes
irreversible. With Russia representing almost 60 percent of the Arctic
coast, [[there is no escaping the need for constructive engagement
with]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[key stakeholder]{.underline}]{.mark} -
at least at the level of scientists - when it comes to global concerns.
Close monitoring of the Arctic is key to improving understanding of the
changes that climate change will bring in the future. These are
existential and global challenges. It goes without saying that Russia's
brutality in Ukraine has profound consequences - for its millions of
victims, but also well beyond Ukraine, not least for the basic norms
underpinning the international normative framework. This deserves a
severe and comprehensive response. At the same time, though, both in
timescale and scope [[the urgent problems of the Arctic require joint
and sustained attention if they are to be effectively mitigated, **for
the sake of the future of humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The dangers
associated with [[the emergence o]{.mark}f]{.underline} possibly
[[dangerous pathogens (including viruses) from the melting
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark} (Cohen, 2023), and the spread of
radioactive waste (Miner et al. 2021), [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} just
two examples of [[risks that will]{.underline} persist and potentially
[undermine global safety and health]{.underline},]{.mark} whether the
war in Ukraine is resolved or not. Taking the latter point further,
there are thousands of radioactive objects - including spent fuel and
corroding nuclear reactors inside sunken vessels - that were dumped at
the bottom of the Arctic seas during the Cold War. Today, political
tensions and international sanctions hinder any retrieval and clean-up
efforts as Russia lacks the equipment and technical expertise to extract
these vessels without foreign assistance (Digges, 2022). The severe
impact that radioactive contamination can have on the environment is
undeniable. It can harm plant and animal life, disrupt ecosystems, and
potentially impact human health through the consumption of contaminated
food and water. As such, the idea of resuming a discussion on extracting
the sunken vessels and their radioactive waste constitutes one tangible
and universally valuable project that could prove the worth of
decoupling certain issues - even if only on an exceptional basis - from
the situation of the war in Ukraine.

### 2AC -- Disease Impact

#### Diseases cause [extinction]{.underline}.

January 2021, "Network Analysis to Identify the Risk of Epidemic
Spreading," Applied Sciences, Vol. 11, No. 7, Multidisciplinary Digital
Publishing Institute, pp. 2997, kgmost

Several [**[epidemics]{.mark}**, such as the Black Death and the Spanish
flu, have [threaten]{.mark}ed **[human life]{.mark}** throughout
history; however, it is unclear if humans will remain safe from the
sudden and fast spread of epidemic diseases]{.underline}. Moreover, [the
[transmission **characteristics**]{.mark} of epidemics
[remain]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[undiscovered]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
this study, [we present]{.underline} the results of [an epidemic
**simulation experiment** revealing the relationship between epidemic
**parameters** and **pandemic risk**]{.underline}. To analyze the
time-dependent risk and impact of epidemics, we considered two
parameters for infectious diseases: the recovery time from infection and
the transmission rate of the disease. Based on the epidemic simulation,
we identified two important aspects of human safety with regard to the
threat of a pandemic. First, humans should be safe if the fatality rate
is below 100%. Second, even when the fatality rate is 100%, humans would
be safe if the average degree of human social networks is below a
threshold value. Nevertheless, certain [[**diseases**
can]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [**[infect]{.mark} all nodes** in
the [human]{.mark} social **[networks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
[these]{.underline} diseases [cause a pandemic when the average degree
is larger than the threshold value.]{.underline} [These]{.underline}
results indicated that certain infectious [diseases [lead to **human
extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline} and can be prevented by minimizing
human contact. 1. Introduction [The emergence of a **pandemic**
is]{.underline} one of the various scenarios frequently discussed as [a
**human extinction event**]{.underline}, and it is listed as [one of the
global]{.underline} [**catastrophic risks** in studies regarding the
future]{.underline} \[1,2,3\]. In particular, [several]{.underline}
pandemics, [such as]{.underline} [[the **Black
Death**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[4,5\], [Spanish flu]{.underline} \[6\],
and those caused by **[[smallpox]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[7\], severe
acute respiratory syndrome (**[[SARS]{.underline}]{.mark}**) \[8\],
[[and **Ebola**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[9\], [have]{.underline}
[[affected a **large population**]{.underline}]{.mark} [throughout
history. The **[risk]{.mark}** of pandemics]{.underline} [[**increases**
with]{.mark} an increase in population
**[mobility]{.mark}**]{.underline} between cities, nations, and
continents, thereby [[threatening **humankind**]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[10,11,12\]. [It is essential to analyze the **epidemic spread** in
society to **minimize the damage**]{.underline} from epidemic disasters;
however, extinctive epidemic spreading experiments have limitations in
real-world situations, as they predict stochastic effects on the spread
without considering the structure of human society. Network-based
approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations and perform
epidemic spreading simulations by considering the network structure of
numerous real-world connections \[13,14,15\]. These methods use various
models of epidemic spreading, such as the
susceptible--infectious--susceptible (SIS) \[16,17,18\],
susceptible--infectious--recovered (SIR) \[19,20,21\], and Watts
threshold models \[22\]. While these methods are mathematically
convenient, they are epidemiologically unrealistic for various
infections because they require exponentially distributed incubation and
infectious periods \[23,24,25\]. Moreover, previous epidemic studies did
not perform quantitative assessment of the pandemic risk depending on
the network connectivity in individuals and fatality rate of various
diseases \[26\]. In the present study, we applied an SIR epidemic model
to a scale-free network with Monte Carlo simulation to identify the
quantitative relationship between infectious diseases and human
existence. Our fundamental hypothesis states that [when the epidemic
**spreads** to all **nodes**]{.underline} of the network and the
fatality rate is 100%, [it can increase the]{.underline} **[pandemic
risk]{.underline}**. To address this, we initially constructed a
scale-free network to simulate a society. Moreover, for the epidemic
spreading simulation, an SIR model was applied to the network to
describe the immune state of an individual after infection. From the
simulation study, we found that the mean degree of a scale-free network
was an essential factor in determining whether epidemics threaten
humans. This approach provides important insights into epidemic
spreading analysis by investigating the relationship between epidemic
and scale-free network parameters. Furthermore, it highlights the
necessity of determining information flow during an epidemic. 2.
Materials and Methods [We designed an epidemic **simulation
process**]{.underline} to identify the relationship between pandemic
risk and network parameters. This study was performed in four steps
(Figure 1): (i) generating a scale-free network model to reflect
real-world conditions; (ii) applying an SIR model to the scale-free
network for epidemic spreading simulations; (iii) adapting the Monte
Carlo method to reflect the stochastic process in the node status of the
SIR model; and (iv) iteratively performing simulation for every
parameter set and analyzing the results. We have provided the source
code and sample results of epidemic simulation in Supplementary
Materials. Figure 1. Overview of epidemic simulation process based on
the Monte Carlo method. (A) We generated scale-free networks for a fixed
population (N = 1,000,000) and various node degrees (k = 2, 5, 7, and
10). (B) Epidemic spreading was simulated by applying a
susceptible--infectious--recovered (SIR) model to the scale-free
network. We set the epidemic parameters, β and γd. β represents the
spreading rate of epidemics, and γd is the reciprocal of γ and reflects
the time interval between infection and recovery. Randomly, 0.05% of
nodes were initially infected. (C) [We adapted the **Monte Carlo
method** to determine the status of the transition]{.underline} from the
infection node to immunization node. Repeated simulations were performed
until a steady state was achieved. (D) For every parameter set, 10,000
simulations were performed. 2.1. Network Generation Based on a
Scale-Free Model We constructed a network model for the epidemic
spreading simulation (Figure 1). The nodes and edges of the network
represent people in the society and their physical contacts,
respectively. We used a scale-free network model, which follows the
preferential attachment property observed in numerous real-world
networks, such as social networks, physical systems, and economic
networks \[27,28,29\]. In the scale-free network, when a node is added
to the network, its likelihood of connecting to existing nodes increases
with an increase in the node's degree. Hub nodes, which lead to fast and
vast spreading of epidemics, exist. Two characteristic parameters,
including N and k, affect the form of scale-free networks. The parameter
N denotes all nodes in the network. In the real world, N indicates the
whole population size. The parameter k is the average degree of the
network, which determines the degree of the newly attached node for each
step during network generation. Following the characteristics of the
network model, we generated scale-free networks representing human
contacts for epidemic spread. The scale-free network was generated by
the Barabasi--Albert graph distribution, in which the network is
constructed from a cycle graph with three vertices, followed by the
addition of k edges at each construction step \[30\]. The k edges are
randomly attached to the vertex based on the degree distribution of the
vertex. After network generation, we investigated the degree
distribution properties of the network (Figure 2). The results indicate
that the degree distributions have similar tendency for networks with
varying number of nodes and edges. This study constructed scale-free
networks with the largest number of nodes considering computational
complexity (N = 1,000,000). Figure 2. Degree distribution of the
scale-free network. We analyzed the degree distribution of the network
based on the number of nodes (N) and mean degree (k). 2.2. Epidemic
Spreading Based on the SIR Model For the epidemic spreading simulations,
we applied an SIR model to the generated scale-free network. The
classical SIR model can be expressed by the following nonlinear
differential equations \[21\]: where S, I, and R represent susceptible,
infected, and recovered compartments, respectively, in the whole
population. S represents people who have not been infected yet but can
be infected in future. I represents infected people who can spread the
epidemic to susceptible people through physical contact. R denotes
people who have recovered or died from the epidemic and who no longer
participate in the epidemic spreading process. The sum of the S, I, and
R values represents the whole population size N. Epidemics have two
parameters in the SIR model, transmission rate (β) and recovery rate
(γ), which arise from the basic reproduction number R0 (Figure 1B). The
basic reproduction number is the number of infections caused by one
infective node \[31,32,33\]. If the R0 is more than 1, the infection can
spread in a population, whereas if R0 is less than 1, the infection
cannot spread. We express the basic reproduction number as R0 = β/γ,
where β represents the spreading rate of epidemics between infective
nodes and adjacent susceptible nodes and γ represents the probability of
recovery from infection \[34\]. We mainly used γd, which is the
reciprocal of γ and reflects the time interval between infection and
recovery. 2.3. Investigation of Epidemic Status Based on the Monte Carlo
Method The epidemic simulation was performed for a time series event by
constructing epidemic status matrix (z) to represent the status of the
nth node at time step t. For each node, the value of epidemic status
matrix at time step t can be 0, 1, or 2, indicating that a node is
susceptible, infective, or recovered, respectively. We initially (t = 0)
set every value of epidemic status matrix to 0 because all nodes are
susceptible before the epidemic spreads. At the initial infection stage,
randomly selected 0.05% of nodes were infected. At every time period, we
performed immunization and observed the infection stages (Figure 3). At
the immunization stage, we identified infective nodes and determined
whether these nodes would be recovered in the next time step. To
calculate the transition probability of infected and recovered
phenomena, the Monte Carlo method was applied \[35,36\]. When infection
and recovery parameters are provided, it is possible to investigate
whether a node transitions from an epidemic state to another state. To
accomplish this, we compared the method revealing the change in each
population in every compartment over time (Figure 4). The final steady
state of the epidemic spreading simulation model indicates the total
number of casualties of the epidemic who either are dead or have
recovered from the disease. Infective nodes at time t (zn \[t\] = 1) are
transformed to recovered nodes at time t + 1 (zn \[t + 1\] = 2) when
1/γd is larger than a random real number between 0 and 1. We determined
whether the neighbor nodes of the infection node would be infected by
identifying susceptible nodes adjacent to the infective nodes at time t
(zn \[t\] = 0, with the adjacent infective node) (Figure 5). When β is
larger than a random real number between 0 and 1, a susceptible node
becomes an infective node at time t + 1 (zn \[t + 1\] = 1); this
scenario represents epidemic spread. For each time step, we recorded the
number of susceptible, infective, and recovered nodes during epidemic
spread. 2.4. Simulation Parameters We carried out simulation trials for
various mean degrees of networks (k = 2, 5, 7, and 10). Each network
considered the following epidemic parameters: β ranges from 0.05 to 0.95
and γd ranges from 1 to 10. The Monte Carlo model was repeatedly
simulated to observe saturation of the recovery process. Considering
that the simulation pipeline contains random processes such as initial
infection and Monte Carlo trials, we performed the simulation
iteratively until the status of nodes remained unchanged. After
simulation, time series data from every simulation were interpolated in
the time domain. The fatality rate determines the ratio of deceased and
recovered individuals in the final population \[37,38,39\]. If the
fatality rate is below 100%, the recovered population contains both dead
and recovered individuals. Such a situation does not always cause a
pandemic. In this simulation, we assumed a 100% fatality rate. To
accomplish this, we enumerated the recovered nodes as dead for
considering the pandemic risk. 3. Results Through our method, we
obtained epidemic spreading data with various network and epidemic
parameter sets. In the present study, we focused on the case where the
epidemic infects all nodes and defined this phenomenon as "extinctive
spread". [[Diseases causing]{.underline} [**extinctive spread**
are]{.underline}]{.mark} [potential candidates of [high]{.mark} pandemic
**[risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the real world, [extinctive spreading
indicates]{.underline} that the [disease will infect **every person** in
the society]{.underline}. From the simulation data, we calculated the
extinctive spread score by dividing the total number of simulation
trials by the number of extinctive spread cases. Thereafter, we
identified that the number of extinctive spread cases is mainly
influenced by spreading speed, which is determined by β, γd, and k
(Figure 6). The extinctive spread region (brown area in Figure 6) is
expanded as the value of mean degree of network (k) is increased,
thereby indicating that the area of extinctive spread becomes noticeably
wider in a dense network than in a sparse network. Thus, the more
contact between people, the higher the risk of epidemics. Moreover, high
γd and high β cause extinctive spread across a large region, indicating
that the high spreading rate and short time interval between infection
and recovery are risk factors of epidemic diseases. In contrast, the
infective nodes recover before they transmit the disease to their
neighbors in low β and low γd scenarios, thus disconnecting the network
and preventing extinctive spread. This occurs because the infective
nodes need more time to transmit the disease in low β and high γd
scenarios. Therefore, the disease begins to subside due to a lack of new
infective nodes. Furthermore, we investigated the range of β and γd for
existing epidemics of the common cold \[40,41\] and fatal diseases,
namely, cholera \[42,43\], Marburg \[44,45\], Ebola (Congo and Uganda)
\[46,47,48,49\], SARS \[50\], and MERS \[51\] (Table 1). We selected
diseases with relatively well-known epidemic parameters, such as average
duration of infection and basic number of reproductions from previous
studies. Transmission rates were calculated using the mean duration of
infectious periods and basic reproduction numbers of the epidemics.
Different studies reveal multiple values of infectious period and
transmission rate for some of these diseases; we considered these values
separately \[40,41,42,43,46,47,48,49\]. For example, the infectious
period of a common cold is from 3 to 7 days and that of Ebola is 6.5
days. Next, we placed the possible regions of these epidemics as a
disease band for various k values (colored lines in Figure 6). When k \>
5, fatal diseases have an opportunity to cause a pandemic. Even when k =
5, diseases such as cholera and Ebola (Congo) can be threatening in
regions of low γd and high, thus demonstrating that the knowledge of
network parameters of the society and the characteristics of epidemic
diseases can aid in quantifying the risk of epidemics. 4. Discussion
[Many [**previous** studies]{.mark} have made stochastic SIR models to
analyze the dynamics or stability of epidemic diseases]{.underline}.
They investigated the distribution of susceptible, infected, and removed
populations for specific epidemic disease spreading, such as cholera,
SARS, Marburg, and MERS, based on mathematical modelling
\[52,53,54,55\]. [However, they [did **not**]{.mark} conduct a
quantitative assessment of pandemic risk taking into [account **physical
contact** between people]{.mark}]{.underline}. To solve this limitation,
we performed epidemic spreading simulations by applying an SIR model to
scale-free networks with Monte Carlo simulation. In the simulation, [we
consider various connectivity and disease characteristics]{.underline}
on scale-free networks. For each network and epidemic parameter set, the
probability of extinctive spread was calculated. [The [results]{.mark}
**[reveal]{.mark}**ed that **[certain]{.mark} infectious
[diseases]{.mark}** can [lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} extinction.
Moreover, even if the disease band extends over the extinctive spread
regions, it does not indicate that human extinction results from the
disease, as the fatality rate is below 100%; however, in the case of
100% fatality, the disease can cause a human extinction event. The risk
of infectious disease is influenced by the network structure. A dense
network has a higher risk of spreading infectious disease than a sparse
network, as we observed in the extinctive spreading maps. According to
our results, when the average degree of human social networks is below
the risk threshold, i.e., less than 4 in this study, human society is
safe from an extinctive outbreak based on our knowledge regarding the
epidemic parameters of the infectious disease. Nevertheless, in other
cases, **[[human extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** is possible. For
example, if the population is 1,000,000 and there are 4 or more
instances of physical contact between people, human extinction events
may occur, depending on the fatality rate of the epidemics. Hence,
physical contact between people is closely related to an extinction
event of infectious diseases. Eventually, from a public health
perspective, lowering the average contact level of society is an
appropriate way to increase the robustness of strategies against the
occurrence of extinction. In the real world, reducing network density
can be accomplished by epidemic prevention activity, such as isolation
and quarantine treatment. This action prevents epidemic risk to the
society, thereby avoiding human extinction. Additional considerations
may improve our analysis. First, large population size and various
proportions of initial infective nodes were not considered in the
experiments. We have confirmed that the result was consistent when the
proportion of initial infective nodes was 0.05% of the total population;
however, this can vary depending on the distinct proportion of initial
infective nodes in a different population. To achieve robust results, we
need to perform additional experiments for various parameters; however,
we could not address this issue due to computational complexity. Second,
we did not consider numerous known epidemic diseases. We calculated the
transmission rates of epidemic diseases using the known infectious
periods and reproduction numbers of the epidemics from evidence in the
literature. In the present study, we only considered five epidemic
diseases, since the information on infectious periods and reproduction
numbers of diseases was mostly unavailable for other epidemic diseases.
Third, this study only considers the SIR model on scale-free networks in
epidemic simulation. Since the dynamics of epidemic diseases can be
varied in different models or networks, it is important to experiment in
various simulation environments to confirm the robustness of the
results. Nevertheless, these limitations can be considered in future
experiments or using improved computational methods. With these further
improvements, our approach can be used as a computational tool to
analyze the risk of epidemic diseases. 5. Conclusions In this study, we
analyzed the risk of epidemic diseases by creating an epidemic
simulation on a scale-free network. Based on the **[simulation
results]{.underline}** for various epidemic parameters, we
**[confirmed]{.underline}** that [certain infectious **diseases** can
lead to **extinction**]{.underline} and can be prevented by minimizing
human contact. We believe that identifying potential candidate diseases
that may lead to human extinction is crucial in addressing epidemic
prevention activities such as quarantine.

Historically, [[disease]{.mark} events have been [responsible for the
**greatest death tolls**]{.mark}]{.underline} on humanity. [[The]{.mark}
1918 [flu was]{.mark} responsible for more than]{.underline} **[[50

such as the plague of Justinian, are thought to have killed 25 million
in the 6th century---constituting over 10% of the world's population at
the time.4 It is an open question whether a future pandemic could result
in outright human extinction or the irreversible collapse of
civilization. [A skeptic would have many **good reasons**]{.underline}
[to think that **existential risk from [disease]{.mark} is
unlikely**]{.underline}. [Such a disease [would]{.mark} need to
**[spread worldwide]{.mark}**]{.underline} to remote populations,
[[overcome]{.underline}]{.mark} **[rare genetic
[resistances]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} [and]{.underline} **[evade

[and]{.underline} **[countermeasures]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[Even
**evolution itself**]{.underline}]{.mark} may work in humanity's favor:
Virulence and transmission is often a trade-off, and so evolutionary
pressures could push against maximally lethal wild-type pathogens.5,6
[While these arguments point to a very small risk of human extinction,
they [do not **rule the possibility out**]{.mark}]{.underline} entirely.
Although rare, [there are recorded instances of species

[[being]{.mark} **almost entirely [wiped out]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by

population collapse include native American tribes exposed to European
diseases, such as the Massachusett (86% loss of population),
Quiripi-Unquachog (95% loss of population), and theWestern Abenaki
(which suffered a staggering 98% loss of population). In the modern

fatality ratio in the absence of treatment]{.underline}, such as rabies
or septicemic plague. Other diseases have a track record of spreading to
virtually every human community worldwide, such as the 1918 flu,10 and
seroprevalence studies indicate that other pathogens, such as chickenpox
and HSV-1, can successfully reach over 95% of a population.11,12 Under
optimal virulence theory, natural evolution would be an unlikely source
for pathogens with the highest possible levels of transmissibility,
virulence, and global reach. But advances in biotechnology might allow
the creation of diseases that combine such traits. Recent controversy
has already emerged over a number of scientific experiments that
resulted in viruses with enhanced transmissibility, lethality, and/or
the ability to overcome therapeutics.13-17 Other experiments
demonstrated that mousepox could be modified to have a 100% case
fatality rate and render a vaccine ineffective.18 In addition to
transmissibility and lethality, studies have shown that other disease
traits, such as incubation time, environmental survival, and available
vectors, could be modified as well.19-2

#### The risk of extinction from pandemics is substantial -- as high as 10% \-- you should prioritize reducing bio-risks

[[Overall]{.mark}, the [risk seems substantial]{.mark}]{.underline}
We've seen a variety of estimates regarding the chances of an
existential biological catastrophe, including the possibility of
engineered pandemics.17 Perhaps the best estimates come from the
[Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (XPT).]{.underline} This project
involved getting [groups of both subject matter experts and experienced
forecasters to estimate the likelihood of extreme events]{.underline}.
[For biological risks, the]{.underline} [range of median estimates
between forecasters and domain experts were as follows: Catastrophic
event (meaning an event in which [10% or more of the human population
dies]{.mark}) by 2100: [\~1--3%]{.mark} [Human extinction event: 1 in
50,000 to 1 in 100]{.mark}]{.underline} Genetically engineered pathogen
killing more than 1% of the population by 2100: 4--10%18 Note: the
[forecasters tended to have lower estimates of the risk than domain
experts]{.underline}. Although they are the best available figures we've
seen, these numbers have plenty of caveats. The main three are: There is
little evidence that anyone can achieve long-term forecasting accuracy.
Previous forecasting work has assessed performance for questions that
would resolve in months or years, not decades. There was a lot of
variation in estimates within and between groups --- some individuals
gave numbers many times, or even many orders of magnitude, higher or
lower than one another.19 The domain experts were selected for those
already working on catastrophic risks --- the typical expert in some
areas of public health, for example, might generally rate extreme risks
lower. It's hard to be confident about how to weigh up these different
kinds of estimates and considerations, and we think reasonable people
will come to different conclusions. **[Our view is that [given how bad a
catastrophic pandemic would be]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the fact that
there seems to be few limits on how destructive an engineered pandemic
could be, and how broadly beneficial mitigation measures are, [**[many
more people should be working on this problem]{.mark}** than current
are]{.underline}. **[[Reducing catastrophic bio]{.mark}logical [risks is
highly valuable]{.mark}]{.underline}** [according to a range of
worldviews]{.underline} Because we prioritise world problems that could
have a significant impact on future generations, we care most about work
that will reduce the biggest biological threats --- especially those
that could cause human extinction or derail civilisation. But
biosecurity and catastrophic risk reduction could be highly impactful
for people with a range of worldviews, because: [Catastrophic
[bio]{.mark}logical [threats would harm near-term interests
too]{.mark}.]{.underline} As COVID-19 showed, **[[large
pandemics]{.mark} [can bring extraordinary costs]{.mark} to people
today, [and]{.mark} even more virulent or deadly diseases would [cause
even greater death and suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Interventions
that reduce the largest]{.mark} biological [risks]{.mark} [are also
often beneficial for preventing more common
illnesses]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Disease surveillance can detect both
large and small outbreaks]{.underline}; counter-proliferation efforts
can stop both higher- and lower-consequence acts of deliberate misuse;
better [PPE could prevent all kinds of infections]{.underline}; and so
on. [**[There is]{.mark} also [substantial overlap between biosecurity
and other world problems]{.mark},** such as global health]{.underline}
(e.g. the Global Health Security Agenda), [factory farming]{.underline}
(e.g. 'One Health' initiatives), [and AI]{.underline}.

#### Disease impacts are the highest probability, fastest timeframe, and also collapses the global economy

Pandemic" TIME http://time.com/4766624/next-global-security/

[The consequences of a major pandemic would be
world-changing]{.underline}. [The 1918 flu pandemic killed]{.underline}
50 million to 100 million people\--at the top end, [more than the
combined total casualties of World Wars I and II]{.underline}\--and for
a slew of reasons[, [humans are]{.mark} arguably [more
vulnerable]{.mark} today [than]{.mark} they were [100 years
ago.]{.mark}]{.underline} First of all, there are simply more of us. The
number of people on the planet has doubled in the past 50 years, which
means [more humans to get infected and to infect others]{.underline},
[especially in densely populated cities]{.underline}. Because [[people
no longer stay in one place]{.mark}\--nearly [4 billion trips were
taken]{.mark} by air last year\--neither do diseases]{.underline}. [[An
infection]{.mark} [in]{.mark} all but [the most remote corner]{.mark} of
the world [can make its way to a major city **in a day or
less**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Climate change also plays a
role]{.underline} as [warmer temperatures expand the range of
disease-carrying animals and insects we\'re exposed to, like the Aedes
aegypti mosquitoes that]{.underline} [transmit Zika.]{.underline} And if
nature isn\'t bloody-minded enough, [[genetic-engineering tools]{.mark}
have [made it easier for terrorist groups or lone madmen to unleash
custom-designed killer germs]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the case of a new
pandemic, modern medicine should provide some protection. But experts
say it\'s more likely that we\'ll be caught without a vaccine to prevent
it or a drug ready to treat it. That\'s true even with many known
viruses. When the last Ebola outbreak exploded, in 2014, eventually
killing more than 11,000 people, the virus wasn\'t a mystery to
scientists; it was discovered in 1976. But even though it had been
killing people on and off for decades, there were no drugs or vaccines
approved to fight it\--and there still aren\'t today, chiefly because
there\'s little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to bring them to
market. [There are troubling economic implications as well]{.underline}.
The 2003 [SARS]{.underline} epidemic, which killed fewer than 800
people, [cost the global economy \$54 billion]{.underline}, much of it
in lost trade, transportation disruption and health care costs. [The
World Bank estimates that the toll from [a severe flu pandemic could
hit]{.mark} \$[4 trillion]{.mark}]{.underline}. One saving grace is that
the scientific understanding of that risk is better than ever. Research
groups are working feverishly to predict the next pandemic before it
even happens. They\'re cataloging threats and employing next-generation
genetic-sequencing tools to speed the discovery of new or mysterious
viruses. They\'re helping identify and track outbreaks as they happen.
But [[microbes evolve]{.mark} about [40 million times as fast]{.mark} as
humans do, [and]{.mark} [we are losing ground]{.mark}]{.underline}.
\"[**[Of all]{.mark} the things [that can kill millions]{.mark} of
people [in very short order]{.mark}**,\" says Dr. Ashish Jha, director
of the Harvard Global Health Institute, \"**the one that is most likely
to occur over the next 10 years is a pandemic**.\" The question is how
policy\--and the government dollars that back it\--can]{.underline}
catch up with the science and [keep the world safe.]{.underline}

### [2AC -- Impact Framing -- Disease Comes First]{.underline}

#### Disease should be our number one priority 

Heather **Exner-Pirot** (Managing Editor, Arctic Yearbook; Director of
Energy, Natural Resources and Environment, Macdonald-Laurier Institute,

The Arctic was long known as a region where the West and Russia were
able to find meaningful ways to collaborate, motivated by shared
interests in concerns in environmental protection and sustainable
development. The phenomenon even had a name: Arctic exceptionalism. Most
of that was lost when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. There has
been much hand-wringing about the extent to which the severing of
political and economic ties should apply to scientific collaboration. In
the Arctic, science has often persevered even when other forms of
engagement were cut off. The International Polar Year 1957--58, the 1973
Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, and the 1991 Arctic
Environmental Protection Strategy are prominent examples. A culture of
Arctic scientific collaboration has also defined the work of the Arctic
Council, the region's main intergovernmental forum. Incremental efforts
to resume collaboration have focused on allowing the council's Working
Groups---populated largely by experts and researchers, and focused on
scientific projects---to resume their work, if virtually rather than in
person. There have been many discussions on whether the Arctic Council
should continue without Russia; the conventional wisdom is that climate
change and other issues are so important that we can't afford to cut
ties completely. [In the Arctic, science has often persevered even when
other forms of engagement were cut off]{.underline}. Academics and
scientists were often encouraged to collaborate with Russians on Arctic
research between 1991 and 2021. Now it is becoming taboo. As Nataliya
Shok and Katherine Ginsbach point out in "Channels for Arctic Diplomacy"
(Issues, Spring 2024), "The invasion prompted many Western countries to
impose a range of scientific sanctions on Russia ... The number of
research collaborations between Russian scientists and those from the
United States and European countries has fallen." In fact, a colleague
of mine was terminated from the University of Lapland for attending a
conference in Russia where he spoke about climate change cooperation.
Shok and Ginsbach do an admirable job of framing this context. But they
go beyond that, reminding us of the importance of scientific
collaboration on human health in the Arctic region. Some of us may
recall, and the authors recount, when a heat wave in 2016 resurfaced
anthrax bacteria long buried in permafrost in Russia's Arctic Yamal
Peninsula. The outbreak killed thousands of reindeer and affected nearly
a hundred local residents. It had us asking, what else will a warmer
Arctic bring back into play? [A study conducted]{.underline} by a team
of German, French, and Russian scholars [before the
invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine sought to help answer this,
[identify]{.underline}ing [13 new viruses revived from ancient
permafrost]{.underline}. This type of research is now under threat.
There's a case to be made that **[[regional collaboration on infectious
disease is even more urgent than that on melting permafrost or other
consequences of climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It's not a
competition; but in general, better understanding Arctic sea ice melt or
Arctic greening won't prevent climate change from happening.
[[Understanding the emergence of new Arctic infectious
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast, **[[can be used to prevent
outbreaks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Shok and Ginsbach recommend, [[at a
minimum]{.underline}]{.mark}, that we [[establish monitoring stations in
the high-latitude Arctic to swiftly identify pathogens in hot spots of
microbial diversity]{.underline},]{.mark} such as mass bird-nesting
sites.

### 2AC -- Arctic Key to Global Stability

#### The Arctic is a key site of development of science diplomacy. Russian belligerence and China's rise necessitate cooperation there

15.7 Conclusion: The International Social Relevance of Arctic
Transnational Knowledge Relations For centuries, [the Arctic has been on
the receiving end of the effects of international political, economic
and systemic developments]{.underline}. These developments have strongly
impacted the small Nordic Arctic nations and Arctic communities with
little concern for their wishes. Some outside developments have brought
economic opportuni- ties, technology, or possibilities for immediate and
subsequent self-government or sovereignty, such as World Wars I and II
did for Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Green- land. Other impacts have
been deeply detrimental as the nuclear and other pollution from Cold War
installations threatening human and environmental security. [[The Arctic
continues to be an integrated part of global developments]{.mark} and is
deeply influenced by the two systemic processes currently
ongoing;]{.underline} that is, the continuing struggles and adaptions
after the end of the Cold War, [[especially concerning]{.mark} post-
Soviet [Russia's]{.mark} international [position]{.mark}]{.underline}
and domestic political and economic system; [[and]{.mark} power
transition with [the rise of]{.mark}]{.underline} especially
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} and globalization with the compression of
time and space in interactions between societies around the world. The
ongoing post-Cold War geopolitical competition between the West and
Russia flared up in the Ukraine crisis, which also affects the Arctic,
not least because of Western political, financial, and technological
sanctioning of Russian Arctic offshore energy developments (such
horizontal escalation makes sense from a Western point of view). [The
Arctic is positively and negatively affected by power transition and
globalization. Power transition has a high conflict potential reflected
in distrust, which is also the case in the Arctic. At the same time, the
spectacular economic growth of China and other emerging markets led to
increases in commodity prices, which the Arctic also benefitted
from.]{.underline} However, [both the challenges of the Ukraine conflict
and the distrust of China in power transition points to important Arctic
lessons of the potential of knowledge- based collaboration for global
governance.]{.underline} [[The Arctic is a particularly valuable
laboratory on this question because it is, in important respects, at the
center of the international political and environmental systems and, as
such, is a crucial case of global governance]{.mark},]{.underline} as
explained elsewhere in the volume by Li and Peng and Kopra. The eight
Arctic states are all old status quo powers of the international system
(Russia was weakened after the dissolution of the USSR and is striving
to regain its historical status). For centuries, Western great power
geopolitics has been played out by those states and the old European
great powers, all of which are observers to the Arctic Council.
[When]{.underline} rising powers, led by [China]{.underline}, kno[ck on
the door of the Arctic,]{.underline} they are not knocking on the door
of a peripheral region, where the status quo powers may or may not
defend their influence; [they are knocking on the backdoor of the status
quo powers.]{.underline} The resilience of Russian--West Arctic research
cooperation at the researcher level during the Ukraine crisis shows the
value of such civilian academic research and educational cooperation to
maintain these connections during such a conflict. The Russian and
Canadian actions I have described [show how states can support academic
cooperation]{.underline} (Russia) [or sabotage it]{.underline} (Canada).
Looking at military joint exercises, such as those between the Norwegian
navy and the Russian Northern Fleet, which were disbanded from Norwegian
side as part of NATO sanctions of defense cooperation with Russia, shows
the vulnerability of defense cooperation. The withdrawal of Exxon Mobile
from offshore oil and gas projects in the Kara Sea is an example of the
vulnerability of commercial, costly science and technology cooperation
to political, financial, and technological sanctions. Sino-Nordic Arctic
research collaboration is in clear contrast to aborted or possi- ble
Chinese investments in land in Iceland or natural resources in
Greenland. Distrust is a structural feature of power transition, and
such distrust is also reflected concern- ing China and the Arctic. [[The
mutual understanding and trust through knowledge co-creation,]{.mark}
which appears to be the case of Sino-Nordic Arctic science cooper-
ation, [points to the value of research and educational cooperation and
knowledge co-creation]{.mark} as valuable tools under power
transition]{.underline}. [[The benefits of such knowledge- based
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} (and the distrust surrounding possible
investments in natural resources and extractive industries) [[suggest
that innovation and knowledge-based cooperation]{.mark} in the
commercial sector [should be promoted in the Arctic]{.mark}---and other
regions.]{.underline} Researcher-initiated interlinked platforms as the
Northern Research Forum, the UArctic Thematic Network on Geopolitics and
Security, the GlobalArctic.org project, and the Calotte Academy show how
virtual platforms with real-life activi- ties can bring Arctic and
outside researchers, talent, and stakeholders from all sectors of
society together. These activities show the local--global and
transnational dimen- sions of the social relevance of science, which
contributes to manage international systemic processes.

### 2AC -- Science Diplomacy Solvency

[Lessons of [the Arctic,]{.mark}]{.underline} such as those from the
Antarctic, [[reveal science as a tool of diplomacy that creates bridges
among nations and fosters stability]{.mark} in regions]{.underline}. It
is well known that [science is necessary for Earth system monitoring and
assessment]{.underline}, especially as an essential gauge of change over
time and space. [Science also is a frequent determinant of public policy
agendas and institutions]{.underline}, often for early warning about
future events. However, even more than an immediate source of insight,
invention, and commercial enterprise, [[science provides continuity in
our global society]{.mark} with its evolving foundation of prior
knowledge.]{.underline} These and other features of [[science
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark},1 as a field of human endeavor, [are
[relevant to our global future in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Building on the East-West breakthrough in the 1986 Reykjavik Summit,
with his Murmansk speech in October 1987, Soviet president Mikhail
Gorbachev envisioned a shared path where "the community and
interrelationship of the interests of our entire world is felt in the
northern part of the globe, in the Arctic, perhaps mor than anywhere
else." Recognizing that "[scientific exploration of the Arctic is of
immense importance for the whole of mankind]{.underline}," Gorbachev
called for creation of a "joint Arctic Research Council." Emerging from
his Murmansk speech, the International Arctic Science Committee was
founded in 1990, followed by the Arctic Environmental Protection
Strategy in 1991, which revealed a "common future" among Arctic
countries and peoples. Also involving the eight Arctic states,2 the
Barents-Euro Arctic Council and Standing Committee of the Conference of
Parliamentarians of the Arctic Region were formed in 1993 and 1994,
respectively. Eventually established in 1996, the Arctic Council
breathed life into a circumpolar community of the eight states and six
indigenous peoples' organizations inhabiting the region north of the
Arctic Circle. "As a high level forum," [the Arctic Council has become
central in an institutional arena for the high north that includes the
above organizations along with many others]{.underline}, starting with
the 1920 Treaty Concerning the Archipelago of Spitsbergen. With its
forty-two signatories, this treaty still stands as a beacon of peaceful
development in the high north. Together, the six scientific working
groups of the Arctic Council are facilitating knowledge discovery and
contributing to informed decisions about "common Arctic issues" of
sustainable development and environmental protection. As a direct
consequence of the Arctic Council, pan-Arctic agreements are being
signed by all Arctic states, beginning with the 2011 search and rescue
agreement and 2013 marine oil pollution response agreement. Interests of
twelve non-Arctic states, including China and India, also are being
accommodated as they are brought in as observers to the Arctic Council.
Moreover, [the so-called Arctic Five5 coastal states are reaching
territorial agreements.]{.underline} As noted in their 2008 Ilulissat
Declaration, "sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in large
areas of the Arctic Ocean" are being addressed cooperatively under the
Law of the Sea, particularly with regard to "outer limits of the
continental shelf." [This commitment includes the United
States,]{.underline} even though it has not yet ratified the 1982 United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Highlighting the cooperation,
Russia and Norway signed an agreement in 2010 about Barents Sea
resources, ending a dispute that had escaped their resolution for the
previous four decades. Winds Are Changing [The current crisis related to
Ukraine has introduced global geopolitics into the Arctic unlike any
world event since the collapse of the Soviet Union]{.underline}. Within
weeks of the Crimea annexation, former U.S. secretary of state Hillary
Clinton was linking the Arctic, Russia, and Ukraine, suggesting in a
March 2014 speech in Montreal that "we need a united front," as reported
by the Globe and Mail. The following month, Canada, the current chair of
the Arctic Council, boycotted the Arctic Council meeting in Moscow.
Lines are being redrawn, which the May/June 2014 issue of Foreign
Affairs reflected with its articles related to "The Return of
Geopolitics." Such [[political posturing risks fueling the long-dormant
"burning security issues"]{.underline}]{.mark} that Gorbachev warned of
[[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Perhaps the world was arriving at
this security intersection in any case, but for different reasons. [The
Arctic Ocean is undergoing an environmental state-change, where the
boundary conditions of the system are being altered]{.underline}. In
fact---with the Arctic warming twice as fast as anywhere else on
Earth---the Arctic Ocean is undergoing the largest environmental
state-change on our planet. The surface of this maritime region
surrounding the North Pole is being transformed from a sea-ice cap that
has persisted for millennia (perhaps even hundreds of millennia) to a
system with sea ice retreating and advancing seasonally. [Rather than
projecting out to the mid-twenty-first century, it is clear that the
Arctic Ocean already has crossed a threshold with open water during the
summer]{.underline} and first-year sea ice during the winter covering
more than 50 percent of its area. Of greater significance, the volume of
Arctic sea ice has decreased more than 70 percent since the late 1970s.
With increasing accessibility in the Arctic Ocean, countries, along with
multinational corporations such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, are
preparing to exploit the region's enormous energy reserves, estimated to
contain 30 percent of the world's undiscovered gas and 13 percent of its
undiscovered oil. Fisheries are opening to commercial harvesting without
regulation, especially in areas of the high seas lacking any regional
fisheries management organization. Arctic shipping routes are being
established to supplement trade through the Panama and Suez Canals. [It
is not a matter of waiting decades or even years for the Arctic Ocean to
be completely ice-free during the summer. There is now a new Arctic
Ocean, one that lacks a permanent sea-ice cap.]{.underline} Like
removing the ceiling to a room, the fundamental shift in the surface
boundary of the Arctic Ocean has created a new natural system with
different dynamics than anything previously experienced by humans in the
region. Separate from the Ukraine situation, [[the environmental
state-change in the Arctic Ocean is introducing inherent risks of
political, economic, and cultural instabilities---which are at the heart
of every security dialogue**. Exposing security risks in the Arctic may
be a good thing, but only if accompanied by inclusive solutions that
both promote cooperation and prevent conflict**]{.mark}. Achieving
International Stability]{.underline} Leaving loose the elephant in the
room, [questions about conflict in the Arctic Ocean remain
unattended]{.underline}. As a consequence, [the associated community of
state and peoples lacks a shared understanding of expectations,
capabilities, interests, and wills to foster lasting stability in the
Arctic Ocean.]{.underline} "Matters related to military security" are
off the table for the Arctic Council. The council avoids even general
considerations of security in the Arctic Ocean, as reflected by
elimination of the security chapter from its second Arctic Human
Development Report, which is due in 2014. With all Arctic coastal states
except Russia as members, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
is the only northern Atlantic organization without a remit in the Arctic
Ocean. This position seems reasonable as long as NATO is seen by Russia
as the "main external threat of war," as stated in the 2010 Military
Doctrine of Russia. These positions made sense immediately after the
Cold War, but decades of cooperation have followed and [[there now is
capacity to project peace into]{.mark} the future for [the Arctic
Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Not all military capabilities are designed
for force,"4 as affirmed for the Arctic Ocean in 2010 by then NATO
supreme allied commander, Admiral James Stavridis. Illustrating this
point, in association with the Arctic Council, meetings among the chiefs
of defense from all Arctic states began in 2012 with regard to their
shared emergency responses in the Arctic Ocean. An opportunity to think
about the Arctic more holistically is further revealed by the NATO
Advanced Research Workshop "Environmental Security in the Arctic Ocean,"
which the author chaired with Russian co-directorship in 2010 at the
University of Cambridge. That workshop became the first formal dialogue
between NATO and Russia regarding security issues in the Arctic Ocean.
[[Global recognition of the need for international stability is a
necessary first step]{.mark} toward lasting peace in the maritime region
bounded by North America, Europe, and Asia at the top of the Earth,
where the interests of the entire international community are
increasingly focused]{.underline}. The next step will involve
implementing an inclusive venue for ongoing dialogue to prevent conflict
as well as promote cooperation in the Arctic Ocean. Cultivating Common
Interests [[International stability is inextricably linked to
sustainable development]{.mark}, which already is acknowledged as a
common Arctic issue to balance [economic prosperity, environmental
protection and social equity]{.mark},]{.underline} taking into
consideration the needs of present and future generations. [Even more
basic to stability in the Arctic Ocean is balancing national interests
and common interests.]{.underline} Although [peace is the most basic
foundation for international stability]{.underline}, the term was
consciously rejected as a common Arctic issue when the Arctic Council
was established. The fear then, as now, was that peace implies
demilitarization. It was only in 2009 that this term even began to
appear in Arctic Council ministerial declarations. Still, "peace" is not
used among all Arctic states in their national security policies for the
Arctic. In fact, it remains to be seen whether Canada, in contrast to
its Arctic foreign policies, will include "peace" in the 2015 Arctic
Council ministerial declaration[. [If the Arctic states are
too]{.underline}]{.mark} [timid or [nationalistic to openly discuss
balance, stability, and peace]{.mark} when tensions are low, [how will
they possibly cooperate when conflicts arise]{.mark}?]{.underline} The
path forward is reflected by the Arctic states' commitment to the Law of
the Sea, which includes zones within as well as beyond sovereign
jurisdictions. Even if continental shelf extensions were conferred all
the way to the North Pole---unambiguously in the overlying water
column---high seas still would exist beyond sovereign jurisdictions,
where more than 160 nations have rights and responsibilities under
international law. Implications of the high seas surrounding the North
Pole are just now entering front stage. At their February 2014 meeting
in Nuuk, Greenland, the Arctic Five took the initiative "to prevent
unregulated fishing in the central Arctic Ocean." Whatever the
international outcomes from this meeting, lessons will resonate from the
high seas of the Arctic Ocean outward across our civilization on a
planetary scale. Statesmanship Is Required [At the moment, there is
neither a forum nor leadership to foster lasting stability in the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}. To prepare for the 2016 Arctic heads of state
meeting that is being considered in the United States on the twentieth
anniversary of the Arctic Council, President Barack Obama has the option
to inspire stability and peace for the Arctic across the twenty-first
century and beyond. Turning back the calendar only a few months to
winter 2014 (remember the Sochi Olympics), Russia was seen in a
different light. Since 2010, the Russian Geographical Society had been
convening the "Arctic Forum for Dialogue," first in Moscow then in
Arkhangelsk in 2011 and in Salekhard in 2013. Each of these
international gatherings in Russia involved scientists and diplomats as
well as government administrators, commercial operators, advocates from
nongovernmental organizations, and indigenous peoples. [Most prominent
in the Arctic forums were the head-of-state presentations,]{.underline}
stimulated by participation of Vladimir Putin initially as prime
minister and most recently as president of the Russian Federation.
President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson of Iceland, as the elder statesman of
the Arctic, participated in all three forums. Prince Albert II of Monaco
presented in 2010 and 2011. With invitations extended to all Arctic
heads of state, President Sauli Niinistö of Finland also participated in
2013. As a common interest, [these heads of state all spoke of stability
and peace in the Arctic, even if only for their national
benefit]{.underline}. In each forum, it also was clear that [the level
of trust and cooperation in the Arctic had matured since the Cold War,
signaling that [international relationships in the Arctic are open and
strong enough to deal with the more difficult issues of preventing
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. To build on the earlier head-of-state
engagements for the Arctic, Obama has the opportunity to convene a
meeting with all other Arctic heads of state and act as a statesman who
puts out the brushfires of the moment while planting seeds of hope and
inspiration for the future. 5 [[The challenge is to create a process of
ongoing and inclusive dialogue about Arctic issues]{.mark} that have so
far eluded shared consideration.]{.underline} With the Arctic, Obama
must be brave enough to [share the 'coin of peace,' [promoting
cooperation]{.mark} on one side and [preventing conflict]{.mark} on the
other. Historic perspectives and [the roles of science diplomacy will
help provide direction]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [to bear fruit in
the interests of humankind, [the political will for lasting stability
and peace in the Arctic must come from all Arctic heads of
state]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the end of the day, peace must be
established explicitly as a common interest among all states and peoples

[[Opportunities for humankind to build common interests are simplified
in areas beyond national jurisdictions, as in the]{.mark} high seas of
the Central [Arctic]{.mark} Ocean]{.underline},50 which is surrounded by
exclusive economic zones of the 'Arctic 5': US, Canada, Denmark with
Greenland and the Faroe Islands, Norway and the Russian Federation.
[These nations are looking seaward in view of their national interests
in contrast to human- kind looking landward from the North Pole as a
'pole of peace']{.underline}.51 [Considering balance between national
interests and common interests with the Arctic High Seas]{.underline} as
focus to build common interests, ambassadorial panels were convened with
science diplomacy in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 2015 as well as 2016, when
high-level representatives contributed from: Canada, China, Finland,
France, Germany, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russian Federation, Sweden,
United Kingdom and US.52 [The Arctic High Seas continues to be an
important focus, balancing the interests of Arctic and non-Arctic
states]{.underline}, as represented by the Arctic High Seas Fisheries
Agreement53 signed by the 'Arctic 5' along with China, Iceland, Japan,
Korea and the European Union. [[The lessons of science diplomacy in the
Arctic are particularly revealing with continuous cooperation between
the US and the Russian Federation]{.mark},]{.underline} co-chairing task
forces to generate three binding Pan-Arctic legal agreements in 2011,
2013 and 2017 with all eight Arctic states (including EU Member States
Denmark, Finland and Sweden) that have sovereign jurisdictions north of
the Arctic Circle. [The Arctic Science Agreement]{.underline}54 [is of
[special value, propelling dialogues between the science and diplomatic
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}55 [[with the primary 'importance of
maintaining peace, stability, and constructive cooperation in the
Arctic']{.underline}]{.mark}.56 Altogether, [the Arctic is an important
focus for transatlantic relations57]{.underline} because it affords
opportunities to balance national interests and common interests for the
benefit of all on Earth. Such opportunities and interests are
represented by the continuous production of communications, resolutions
and decisions from the European Commission, Parliament and Council of
the European Union about governance mechanisms and built infrastructure
in the High North.58 Moreover, the 2nd Arctic Science Ministerial in
Berlin in 2018, 59 building on the first in Washington, DC, in 2016,60
is a tangible demonstration of transatlantic interests in the Arctic:
'Be it a frontier or a gateway to Europe, the Arctic is a region of vast
importance not only to the 4 million people living there, but also to
the European Union and to the rest of the world'. 61 6 CONCLUSION: THE
FUTURE OF SCIENCE DIPLOMACY [Fuelled by questions for our knowledge
economy]{.underline} (Fig. 4) - [[the engine of science diplomacy is
informed decision-making]{.mark} with its associated theory, methods and
skills that can be applied, trained and refined from global-local
levels]{.underline}.62 The applications of informed decision-making are
scalable without boundaries across the seventeen SDGs, which are
holistic in the context of our survival as a globally-interconnected
civilization. From the Treaty of Westphalia forward, nation-states have
been the basic jurisdictional unit. However, the world wars of the
twentieth century created international dimensions on a planetary scale,
starting with the League of Nations, established with the Treaty of
Versailles63 in France to end World War I. After World War II,
establishment of an inclusive international forum emerged with the
United Nations Charter,64 signed among the redwoods of California with
symbo- lism for our world forever after, defining its purposes in the
opening words of Article 1: 'to maintain international peace and
security'. With productive consequence, the United Nations has been
operating in an holistic manner to maintain international peace and
security, as reflected by the evolution of the SDGs. However,
[[maintaining international peace and security now transcends boundaries
beyond the capacities of nation-states]{.mark} alone, [recognizing that
sustainability on a planetary scale operates]{.mark} across a spectrum
of jurisdictions, ranging [from the international to the]{.mark}
national and [subnational]{.mark},]{.underline} in particular cities
(Figure 5). As the global human population continues to accelerate, many
cities and sub- national regions already are more powerful economically
than many nation-states,65 recognizing that nations also wield
militaries as a distinguishing source of power. However, even this
distinction is being minimized with the advent of asymmetric capacities
and threats, as in the arena of cybersecurity. Nonetheless, the
emergence of 'megacities'66 with populations over 10 million represents
the rise of sub-national jurisdictions, whose capacities are rapidly
accelerating with urbanization on a global scale (Figure 5).
Simultaneously, STI is more central to the everyday activities of
humankind, from smart phones and social media to robotics and artificial
intelligence among many other transformations. With many questions to
address, megacities -- with those on the two sides of the Atlantic --
will have increasingly important roles in the local-global implemen-
tation of the SDG, complementing the global-local capacities of nations
to operate together across a 'continuum of urgencies' from security to
sustainability time scales.70 [[The full spectrum of sub-national to
international jurisdictions now is contributing to the progress of our
globally-interconnected civilization]{.underline}]{.mark}, when
[[national interests alone are insufficient]{.mark} to build common
interests on a planetary scale,]{.underline} forever remembering the
consequences of nationalism were global conflict in the twentieth
century.71 [[Common-interest building with science diplomacy among
allies and adversaries]{.mark} alike after World War [II is revealed by
the establishment of international spaces]{.mark}]{.underline}.72 As [an
holistic process with informed decision-making to achieve sustainability
at local-global scales, science diplomacy has relevance to the US,
Europe]{.underline} (the EU and its members)73 [and the Russian
Federation]{.underline}74 as well as the rest of our world.75 [[The
global relevance of diplomacy and sustainability with 'science as a
public good']{.underline}]{.mark} is recognized by the International
Science Council (ISC)76 that emerged from the union of the International
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) and the International Social
Sciences Council (ISSC), championing holistic integration. Within the
ISC, global leadership with science diplomacy is being provided
especially by the International Network on Government Science Advice
(INGSA)77 with its relationship to the Foreign Ministries Science and
Technology Advice Network (FMSTAN).78 [[Science diplomacy is maturing as

reflected by targeted funding from the European Commission during the

### 2AC -- Arctic Conflict

#### Arctic security competition increasing now. Russian militarization, increased Chinese activity, and lack of NATO readiness means high risk of conflict

**Flanagan 2025.** Molly Flanagan Research Intern · The American
Security Project "NATO's Urgent Arctic Defense Strategy: Countering
Russia and Securing Key Resources Amid Rising Geopolitical Tensions"
American Security Project March 14, 2025. \<\> Accessed 6/24/25. ARJSH

In President [Trump's]{.underline} recent speech to Congress, his
reiteration of his [desire to acquire Greenland "one way or the other"
is a reflection of the intensifying strategic competition in the
Arctic.]{.underline} As climate change accelerates, countries are
seeking to exploit the changing landscape, leading to increased
commercial and military activity. Though the area has a history of
contest, [the environment's rapidly melting ice has revealed a wealth of
natural resources and increasingly navigable shipping routes with grand
economic implications]{.underline}. Consequently, in recent years,
[[growing Russian militarization]{.mark} has raised considerable concern
among Arctic states, [heightening tensions as the region becomes
geopolitically more significant]{.mark}, making it more crucial than
ever for NATO countries to strengthen their relationships and develop a
unified defense strategy.]{.underline} During the Cold War, [[the Arctic
became a NATO frontline]{.mark} mainly focused on under-ice submarine
activity and airspace monitoring]{.underline}. [Following the collapse
of the Soviet Union, the region]{.underline} was considered "High North,
Low Tension" and [saw an era of relatively peaceful cooperation. This
period decisively ended with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and
saber-rattling has grown far more direct.]{.underline} Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov recently stated that [[Russia is "fully ready to defend
its interests militarily, politically, and from the standpoint of
defense technologies \[in the Arctic\]."]{.underline}]{.mark} [Following
the NATO accession of Sweden and Finland, [Putin has only grown more
sensitive to fears of "encirclement" by the alliance]{.mark}, possibly
explaining more recent demonstrations of power projection by increased
military aircraft and maritime activity in the area.]{.underline} In the
last two decades, [[Russia has significantly expanded its polar
presence]{.mark}, bolstering its northern security and strategic
position]{.underline}, while benefiting from its ownership of more than
half of the coastline in the region. As part of this, [Russia has
[invested in reopening Soviet-era infrastructure]{.mark} [and
modernizing its military assets]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Furthermore, [[China is expanding its presence there by partnering with
Russia]{.mark} for regional access, declaring itself a "Near-Arctic
State," and [conducting joint polar military exercises that complicate
the security environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic is vital for
economic and resource reasons as well. The Northern Sea Route (NSR)
offers a quicker maritime route between Europe and Asia, and Russia's
control of this increasingly accessible waterway could potentially
disrupt allied commercial or military shipping, challenging freedom of
navigation. Moreover, with significant oil and gas reserves, Russia has
leverage over global energy markets, particularly as Europe remains
dependent on Russian fossil fuels that help fund Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. [[Russia's Arctic activities test NATO's readiness and
capabilities]{.mark} and are part of a broader global strategy, as its
vigilant security efforts provide [stark contrast to the lack of NATO
strategic collective defense in the region]{.mark}. Seven Arctic
territorial claimants are NATO members, counterbalancing Russia's
presence, but the response has been slow and inadequate given these
developments. NATO has acknowledged the developing need for a more
coordinated security strategy]{.underline}, but still greatly lags
behind Russia in its collective defense posture. [[NATO would need at
least 10 years to match Russia's current regional security
infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline} This latent approach is further
solidified by the fact that [[the]{.mark} [alliance presently has no
formal Arctic policy]{.mark}, underscoring insufficient urgency and
resources dedicated to the region.]{.underline} To swiftly adapt to the
evolving security landscape, NATO must develop a clear strategy to
strengthen the collective defense of its Northern Flank and safeguard
its interests through enhanced infrastructure, expanded patrols, and the
security of critical resources. This includes: Closing the security
infrastructure gap by expanding and enhancing major projects, including
military bases and anti-missile defense systems, as a priority.
Increasing air and naval patrolling in strategically important areas,
like the GIUK gap and the Barents Sea, to monitor and record any
potential growing threats. Securing critical key systems (i.e., undersea
communication cables, pipelines, and shipping routes) to defend its
regional interests. Adopting an official Arctic security policy that
outlines guidance and goals in the region and ensures a unified effort
across member states. As [the warming Arctic is set to become a key
global frontier for geopolitical strategic competition, [Russia's polar
dominance has only grown, while China is now spreading its influence as
an extra-regional actor.]{.mark} The "NATO 7" must enhance efforts to
create a more comprehensive collective defense strategy to secure
members' interests]{.underline} in the region[.]{.underline} Adaptation
to the evolving climate in the High North will require [[proactive
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} between allies, enabling NATO a
robust and unified defense posture that [[addresses]{.underline}]{.mark}
the growing challenges [and [long-term stability in the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Russia previously adopted a similar

\[84\]. [[In the Arctic]{.mark}, where large-scale conventional military
actions are difficult to undertake, the covert and destructive
[characteristics of hybrid warfare become particularly salient]{.mark}.

Under conditions of low-intensity confrontation, both sides may develop
new modes of conflict---not only avoiding the uncontrollable risks of
direct warfare but also [cont[inually reshaping Arctic power boundaries
through dual-use technologies and gray-zone operations]{.mark}. This
intermediate state of "neither war nor peace" is likely to define the
fundamental paradigm of Arctic security competition in the near
future.]{.underline}

Nuclear Arms Control

The risks of pandemics and even climate disruption pale before those of
nuclear war.1 There has not been nuclear war in more than seventy-five
years, and the number of nuclear weapons has substantially decreased
from the approximately 30,000 that the United States and the USSR
maintained at the height of the Cold War. But [[there is little left
of]{.mark} the nuclear [arms control and]{.mark}
**[non-prolif]{.mark}**eration [regimes]{.mark} that were put together
over more than thirty years]{.underline}. [Hundreds of missiles in the
United States and in Russia are still ready to be launched on warning of
an incoming attack.]{.underline}

The recent threats to use nuclear weapons in the [Ukraine war remind us
that accidental or intentional **[escalation]{.mark}** to nuclear war
**[is still possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Ukraine conflict has
just seen the gross irresponsibility of the [militarization of a
civilian nuclear power plant]{.underline}.2 To make matters still more
dangerous, many [[countries]{.mark} are [developing]{.mark} [hypersonic
missiles]{.mark} that would give a target country only five minutes or
so to respond to a warning of an attack, and hence would greatly
[increase]{.mark} the [risk of]{.mark} accidental [nuclear
war]{.mark}]{.underline}---a perfect example of our failure to control
the march of technology.

Challenges of the Information Age

[Issues of arms control also extend to cybersecurity]{.underline}.
[Cyberwarfare can quickly get out of control, since a
[cyberattack]{.mark} on critical infrastructure can [set off a
counterattack]{.mark} only [a fraction of a second
later]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[We]{.mark} urgently [need]{.mark} to
develop [a]{.mark} technically and politically sound [regime to prevent
accidental cyberwar]{.mark}, install [speed breaks]{.mark} on actions
and reactions to cyberattack, [and discourage attacks]{.mark} on sites
of political leadership, nuclear command-and-control centers, hospitals
and other key civilian infrastructure.]{.underline}

Arms control for cyberwarfare faces both geopolitical and technical
obstacles. Detecting violations of any arms limitation agreement is
difficult and identifying the source of a cyberattack could be slow and
uncertain. The US is said to be superior to its potential adversaries in
cyber, but is also more dependent on it and hence more vulnerable to
cyber-attack. Cyber also raises the ethical question of whether
autonomous weapons should be allowed to kill without any human
intervention in the decision process.

The Techno-Authoritarian Challenge

The internet was originally constructed to promote freedom of speech,
information, and innovation. These are basic values in democracies but
are security threats to authoritarian governments. Early Internet
enthusiasts predicted that authoritarian governments would find it
technically impossible to block information on democracy, freedom of
religion, and protests while still allowing in other, non-political
information. This illusion did not last. Authoritarian countries have
transformed the Internet and social media into tools for the control of
information and comprehensive surveillance. The resulting
techno-authoritarian system can be used to suppress political opponents
and control oppressed minorities.

The Chinese government is promoting this system to like-minded countries
as an alternative to Western ideas of democracy and freedom. We are well
on the way to a "splinternet"---a global network that is half free and
half controlled by repressive governments. The governments of Russia,
China, and other countries are also using communications technologies to
undermine democracies and alliances, influencing elections and spreading
disinformation.

Ethics and Equity

Other new technologies raise additional ethical issues. Geoengineering
and gene drives for humans, for example, have great potential value for
environment and health and could be put into practice by private
companies, researchers, or even wealthy individuals. We are still far
from consensus as to whether the potential benefits of these
technologies outweigh the risks, both known and unknown, of even
small-scale implementation. Once these technologies are developed to the
point of plausible efficacy, there will be pressure to use them as
political tools and business opportunities.

Another ethical quandary is that most innovative new products are first
marketed to consumers willing to pay more for the latest and the best,
and gradually make their way down to cheaper products that everyone can
afford. But some requirements of low-income people---a malaria vaccine
or a flyproof latrine, for example, require specific innovations for
which there is no "Cadillac." For such innovations, public-spirited
intervention by a government or a non-profit organization is typically
necessary. Happily, the first effective malaria vaccine, the product of
thirty years of research, has been approved by the World Health
Organization and is being rolled out across Africa with the support of
industry and non-profit financing organizations.

Lessons

[[Science and tech]{.mark}nology [are ubiquitous]{.mark} in
international affairs, interwoven with politics, economics, business,
law, and culture.]{.underline} Allowed to flourish, science and
technology promise us longer, richer, healthier, more rewarding lives.
But left to themselves, science and technology leave important human
problems and ethical issues unaddressed. The [[multilateral
regimes]{.mark} for addressing global problems have been allowed to
decline, **[fall]{.mark}**ing [behind advances]{.mark} in science and
technology]{.underline}.

In particular, the [[arms control and disarm]{.mark}ament regimes that
protect us from nuclear war [need strengthening]{.mark} and
updating]{.underline}. [They will r[equire collaborative research
and]{.mark} frank [discussions]{.mark} [involving hostile]{.mark} and
distrustful [governments]{.mark}, militaries, [and
researchers]{.mark}]{.underline}. These issues were challenging enough
during the Cold War. They will be all the more difficult today.

[[We need more science and technology]{.mark} to better understand the
climate, how diseases spread, and the likely impact of gene drives and
geoengineering. We also need policies, [institutions]{.mark}, and
private initiatives [that address]{.mark} important ethical issues [and
guide]{.mark} scientific **[research and tech]{.mark}**nological change
in responsible directions.]{.underline}

These **[[examples show]{.mark} the [need to strengthen]{.mark} and
update [international regimes]{.mark} to circumvent geopolitical
conflict and deal with global problems, [and the value of having
scientists and non-scientists work together across]{.mark} national
boundaries and geopolitical [divides]{.mark} on these difficult,
multidisciplinary issues]{.underline}**. [These are major challenges for
science diplomacy. The fire has started, and without urgent action there
might not be time to put it out]{.underline}.

There is nothing automatic about [the nuclear]{.underline} **[[domino
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and it has been successfully countered in
some regions, but the theory [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[generally]{.underline} [**[correct]{.mark}**. [The Soviet Union got the

[Hiroshima]{.mark}, "The balance has been broken]{.underline}. Build the
bomb. It will remove the great danger from us." [[Britain and France got
the bomb because the Soviets]{.mark} (and the U.S.) [had it. China did
the same, then India]{.mark}]{.underline} got the bomb because China
did; [[Pakistan because India did]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Nuclear competition in Asia would not end if South Korea decided to
build a nuclear arsenal. [[Others]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} [likely]{.underline} **[[follow
suit]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Japan, Taiwan, perhaps Vietnam. Similarly,
a Saudi bomb would likely beget an Iranian bomb, a Turkish bomb and even
an Egyptian bomb. Far from making the region --- and the United States
--- safer, these [**[arms races]{.underline}** [would]{.underline}
**[blanket the globe]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with]{.underline}
[**nuclear tripwires**, each]{.underline} [**[primed]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[unleash]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[unprecedented]{.underline}** **[[destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[at the slightest twitch]{.underline}.

Where you stand determines what you see. Kennedy and the other
[[presidents]{.underline}]{.mark} stood atop the chain of command, and
their own experiences with that awful responsibility (particularly with
the near-miss of the Cuban Missile Crisis) colored how they saw nuclear
politics. They [[recognized]{.mark} the [limitations]{.mark} of theory
in a world characterized by]{.underline} [**[imperfect
information]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
[[**frictions of human interaction**.]{.mark} They understood what the
nuclear theorists could not --- that [more countries having]{.mark}
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark} [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[only increase]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the [risk]{.mark} of their
use,]{.underline} **[not lessen]{.underline}** [it]{.underline}.

Three months before the Cuban Crisis, Kennedy's Secretary of Defense,
Robert McNamara, gave a speech in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he laid out
this danger. "The mere fact that no nation could rationally take steps
leading to nuclear war does not guarantee that a nuclear war cannot take
place," he said. "Not only do nations sometimes act in ways that are
hard to explain on a rational basis, but [**[even when]{.underline}**
[acting]{.underline}]{.mark} in a **['[rational']{.mark}]{.underline}**
way [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes, indeed disturbingly [often,
[act on]{.mark} the basis of]{.underline}
**[[misunderstandings]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the true facts of a
situation. They misjudge the way others will react, and the way others
will interpret what they are doing."

[Any [attempt to rationalize]{.mark} nuclear relationships --- treating
adversaries like two sides of a balanced equation --- [removes]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [**[human factor]{.mark}**: the tendency towards
irrationality and error. In a world with [just a handful]{.mark} of
nuclear states, that factor has]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}**

world [with a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**dozen more**]{.mark},
those]{.underline} [[risks]{.underline}]{.mark} [would]{.underline}

**[diplomacy,]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**

Marzhan Nurzhan, a UNODA/OSCE Scholar for Peace and Security, has
availed of the opportunity to write a two-part series of articles in
'Atomic Reporters', titled "Roles of key civil society actors in nuclear
disarmament---Epistemic communities in multi-track diplomacy fora".
Nurzhan showcases some of the instances of track 2 diplomacy activities
through citizen and science diplomacy interactions.

"These occasions," says Nurzhan, "serve as a reminder to further
continue pursuit of global nuclear disarmament in retaining negative
peace implications and reinforce the need for more engagement on the
topic of nuclear arms and international security through civil society
empowerment, disarmament education, peacebuilding activities and
mediation via multi-track diplomacy channels".

She was Fellow at the Nuclear Nonproliferation Education and Research
Center at the KAIST. She was also the Education/Outreach Coordinator for
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization's (CTBTO) Youth
Group in 2019-2020. In 2017, Nurzhan was chosen by the President of the
UN General Assembly as the youth speaker for the United Nations High
Level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament that was held that year.

[Guided by]{.underline} the principle of [social responsibility to the
dual nature of science,]{.underline} the roles and actions of the
scientists to be a part of the discussions laid the foundation of the
term "citizen scientist", states Nurzhan.

[One of the most [prominent examples of]{.mark} the actions of [citizen
scientists was]{.mark} the collaboration on a manifesto issued jointly
by Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russel]{.underline} in 1955[, which
[emphasized]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[dangers of nuclear arms
and]{.mark} [call]{.mark}ed [for peaceful resolution]{.mark} of
international conflict caused by the Cold War.]{.underline}

The [manifesto was launched under the chairmanship of Joseph
Rotblat]{.underline}, a nuclear physicist, who worked to develop the
first atomic bomb in the framework of the Manhattan project. With a
strong belief that science and research should purport peace, [Rotblat
assembled a group of scientists and others from the east and west blocks
under the auspices of the Pugwash [Conferences]{.mark} on Science and
World Affairs, that he **[established]{.mark}** to provide **[platform
for dialogue on]{.mark}** the issues of **[disarm]{.mark}**ament and
global security.]{.underline}

He was also recognized as a citizen scientist while being awarded a
Nobel Peace Prize (1995) shared with the Pugwash movement for "their
efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international
politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms".

Although [an American epistemic community
[pioneered]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[foundation of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [internationally common knowledge and system of nuclear [arms
control,]{.mark} [collaboration with]{.mark} the [Soviets]{.mark} to
[avert]{.mark} nuclear [war and retain]{.mark} strategic
[stability]{.mark} strengthened security regime between the opposing
sides]{.underline}, continues Nurzhan. [Thanks to the establishment of
an international negotiation agenda based on the epistemic community
engagement, policy proposals were taken into consideration and
implemented in various ways.]{.underline}

Track two diplomacy was practiced not only within scientific circles,
but also encouraged citizen diplomats, among the ordinary public, to
join the efforts to promote peace and preserve humankind from the
catastrophe of nuclear conflict. One of the instances was connected with
the American girl Samantha Smith, who wrote a letter to then Soviet
leader, Yuri Andropov, to convey her concern regarding the possible
nuclear exchange between two superpowers in 1982. She was invited to
visit the Soviet Union which displayed the peacebuilding initiative that
resulted in the establishment of cultural exchange programs with the
United States fostering further growth of citizen diplomacy.

Another example of the citizen diplomacy is the American-Soviet peace
walks comprised of a five-week long trip from Leningrad to Moscow that
took place in 1987 and brought together 230 Americans and 200 Soviets
impacting the way of their interaction and creating better understanding
between the people from two axis of powers.

[Amid]{.underline} these [citizen diplomacy]{.underline} initiatives,
the [[doctors]{.underline}]{.mark} from the USA and the USSR [founded an
organisation called International Physicians for the Prevention of the
Nuclear War (IPPNW)]{.underline} in 1980, which was awarded a Nobel
Peace Prize in 1985[. Despite the ideological divide, they demonstrated
a common interest in preserving humankind from atomic
warfare.]{.underline} They [[organised anti-nuclear protests]{.mark} to
stop worldwide testing and to raise awareness of the public regarding
the health, humanitarian and environmental consequences of the use of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

Another fact of citizen diplomacy was depicted by the decision of Soviet
officer, Stanislav Petrov, to save the world from the nuclear conflict
whereas his duty was to register external missile attack, when in one of
the days in 1983 the Soviet Union early-warning systems elicited an
incoming nuclear strike which must had been reported and he instead
chose to dismiss it as a false notification.

All these [examples of citizen diplomacy actions along with [science
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline} and track two diplomacy interactions
[[led to]{.mark} more [appearance and diversity of informed]{.mark}
civil society [actors]{.mark}]{.underline}, resulting in the rise of
non-governmental organisations to participate in international
deliberations and demanding nuclear disarmament, notes Nurzhan. For
instance, [the NPT Preparatory Committee meetings and Review Conferences
serve as a main forum for civil society actors and NGOs]{.underline} to
officially take part in public meetings, deliver speeches and
statements, organise side-events since 1994.

[In 1995 [at the]{.mark} Review Conference of the
[NPT]{.mark},]{.underline} 195 [[NGOs]{.underline}
[attended]{.underline}]{.mark} as observers, where the indefinite
extension of the Treaty was made. [United in the pursuit of nuclear
disarmament and abolition of the nuclear arms, representatives of the
NGOs jointly prepared a statement consisting of 11 points which [called
for]{.mark} a nuclear weapons convention that takes into account a
[verification]{.mark} aspect, the [illegality]{.mark} of the use and
threat to use nuclear arms, the completion of a truly comprehensive
[test ban]{.mark} treaty, a start of [negotiations]{.mark} on a treaty
to eliminate nuclear weapons within a specific timeframe and
etc]{.underline}.

"Since then, civil society [[actors actively participate]{.mark} in
every NPT meetings]{.underline} at the United Nations and have the
opportunity to address the delegations within given time, to make
interventions at the official meetings, to organise briefings, to engage
in a dialogue with the representatives of the governments and voice
their issues," states Nurzhan.

However, there are also some limitations related to the participation of
the NGOs in the closed meetings between the States Parties due to
security concerns given the confidential nature of arms control
negotiations and mechanism of the NPT process.

Nevertheless, there is a recent practice of [including civil society
actors, [scientific]{.mark} or political [researchers]{.mark} in most of
the cases, members of the parliament into the States delegations at the
table of negotiations to [influence policy]{.mark} field [to function as
advisors]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is in line with the recommendation
based on the UN Study on Disarmament and Non-proliferation Education
(2002).

Thus, throughout time, activities of civil society in the nuclear field
transformed from being seen as activists or protesters to becoming more
professional as epistemic community representatives, and [[their
role]{.mark} in multilateral negotiations [was **decisive**]{.mark} in
exerting pressure and influence by campaign work, advocacy initiatives
and lobbying [to adopt]{.mark} several [agreements such as the
CTBT]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1996, [advisory opinion on the legality of
threat or use of nuclear weapons by the International Court of Justice
(ICJ) issued in 1996.]{.underline}

[[After]{.underline}]{.mark} a [political [stalemate at the
NPT]{.mark}]{.underline} and absence of significant progress for years
to fulfil the Article Six obligation by the States Parties, [effective
and democratic [participation of the]{.mark} nuclear

the multilateral forum of the United Nations OEWG (Open-ended working
group) taking forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations in
2016 under imperative of the "catastrophic humanitarian consequences of
any use of nuclear weapon",]{.underline} which subsequently [[led
to]{.mark} the [adoption of the]{.mark} Treaty on the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons ([TPNW]{.mark})]{.underline} in 2017 and entry into
force in January 2021. \[IDN-InDepthNews --- 18 August 2021\]

#### Science diplomacy key to solve bioterror and neuroweapons

\-- doa: 7/1/25, MoState JG

In the early 1970s [concern was expressed over threats and impacts of
advances in biology]{.underline}, particularly on the impacts of
[genetic engineering]{.underline}, and Issues related to [biosafety and
regulations]{.underline} were discussed. [[As genetic
engineering]{.mark} was getting [established]{.mark} as a novel
technology that had huge potential to benefit and harm,
[scientists]{.mark} themselves [were concerned
about]{.mark}]{.underline} [bio**[safety]{.mark}** and issues arising
out of recombinant DNA research]{.underline}. [So in the Asimolar
Conference]{.underline}, convened by scientists themselves a Declaration
was adopted and scientists decided that they would adopt self-regulation
as at that time there was no national level legislation/regulation in
the USA. The [[rules]{.mark} adopted by the scientists [laid]{.mark} the
[foundation]{.mark} stone [for]{.mark} modern biotechnology
[regulation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the next few years, it became
clear that fears were exaggerated and recombinant DNA research was
crucial in biotechnology research. Today about four decades and a half
have passed. Still the [Asimolar conference is regarded as a pioneering
conference, not just for the technical issues discussed there, but also
for the decision to adopt self-regulation and minimize potential risk.
Scientists thus responded to public concerns and concerns within the
scientific community.]{.underline} What was novel once often turns out
be routine and an ordinary matter over a period of time. The same has
happened to the techniques and technologies discussed in Asimolar
Conference, as recombinant DNA research soon became a routine affair in
biotechnology. It became clear that fears were exaggerated and
technology resulted in applications, many of which were not envisaged
then. A criticism of the Conference was that it ignored ethical, legal
and social impacts (ELSI) of the technology and focused solely on
technical issues and concern for environment and health. Yet the key
lessons from Asimolar were that [[developing consensus was
critical]{.mark} and prudent action in light of uncertainty was
important]{.underline}.1 [[Today]{.mark}, we have technologies/
applications such as **[synth]{.mark}**etic **[bio]{.mark}**logy that
[confer]{.mark} to scientists far [more power]{.mark} than genetic
engineering or recombinant DNA technologies did.]{.underline}2 But they
have such a wide-ranging impact that discussion on ethical, legal and
social implications are part of the debate among scientists, National
Academies of Science and regulators. In case of human genome project, a
specific percentage of money as allocated for ELSI research and
governments and scientists made efforts to reach out to the public and
allay their fears as well as to learn from the public about their
concerns, values, fears and expectations. But governing human genome
mapping was relatively easier as the number of countries was limited and
they had come to an understanding among themselves. So, except for a few
issues like intellectual property rights and data management models,
human genome mapping did not emerge as a challenge for governance at the
international level. At the national level, countries had revised their
regulations based on regulation of biotechnology/genetic engineering. In
case of human reproductive cloning while there was a UN declaration on
banning human reproductive cloning, progress could not be made on a
binding international treaty on human reproductive cloning.
[[Although]{.mark} efforts were made to build a consensus and move
towards a binding treaty it did not go beyond a point, because
[consensus did not emerge]{.mark}. Thus while. In 2005, the United
Nations adopted Declaration on Human Cloning, a binding treaty is
nowhere is sight. Still it is suggested that [a global]{.mark}
governance [framework]{.mark} [may]{.mark} still [be
possible]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Synth]{.underline}]{.mark}**etic
**[[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}**logy [[is not governed]{.mark} by any
international treaty or convention.]{.underline} In the last few years
it has been discussed in Convention on Biological Diversity and many
studies have been done. The forthcoming COP-MOP to be held next year in
Kun Ming, China is likely to make some progress on this. But given its
implications for biosafety and biosecurity, whether the Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD) is the right forum is a question. At the same
time [as it has ramifications for other sectors ranging from health to
agriculture, its governance at the global level raises new
challenges]{.underline}. These range from whether the precautionary
principle is the right principle to govern synthetic biology to whether
products of synthetic biology are treated as Genetically Modified
Organisms (GMO) / Living Modified Organisms (LMO) or their equivalent.
In December 2017 the ad-hoc technical experts group created by Parties
to the Convention on Biological Diversity, decided that organisms
developed or being developed under current methods of synthetic biology,
including the ones containing gene drives will fall under the category
of LMOs. LMOs are regulated under Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB).
CPB has been ratified by most countries in the world and has 171 Parties
to it. CPB has an elaborate mechanism to handle LMOs and invokes the
Precautionary Principle. So negotiating further under CBD/CPB seems to
be a better option but some of the countries that are innovators in
Synthetic Biology and Gene Drives are not Parties to CBD or CPB. For
example, USA is not a Party to CBD while Australia, and, Canada are not
parties to CPB. Noting that broader shifts in global biodiversity
governance are happening, Rabitz points out that a broader package deal
with specific provisions on Gene Drive Organisms (GDO) can be arrived at
the forth coming COP-MOP (Rabitz, 2019; P.9). But in the case of
Synthetic Biology [there is a strong and [growing]{.mark}]{.underline}
Do It Yourself Biology ([[DIY Bio]{.mark}) movement]{.underline} [that
[has become global]{.mark}]{.underline} and the DIY Bio community is
also an important contributor in terms of innovation and events like
iGEM incentivize students to work on Synthetic Biology. [This
**[diffusion of tech]{.mark}**nology [among those who do not work
under]{.mark} the typical [biosafety]{.mark} regulatory [regime]{.mark}
and the diversity in their uses and applications [is a challenge]{.mark}
to governing Synthetic Biology]{.underline}. Most of the DIY Bio groups
are aware of biosafety concerns and adopt safety procedures and take
precautionary measures. [How to regulate and govern DIY Bio is a key
issue because DIY Bio promotes citizen science and enables better
understanding of science and hence has to be supported but [as it
**raises questions on**]{.mark} biosecurity, biosafety and
**[bioterrorism]{.mark}**, it cannot be left entirely to DIY Bio
groups]{.underline}. Will selfregulation combined with monitoring by a
government agency is enough or should this also be regulated as a
regular scientific activity? Genome Editing is a novel technology that
has emerged since 2012 or so, and is revolutionizing the way scientists
handle and manipulate genomes. While human genome mapping enabled
scientists to explore and understand the genome better, Genome Editing,
offers them tools and protocols to edit the Genome, or, 'to rewrite the
genetic code'. There are some common features among Synthetic Biology,
Genome Editing, Gene Drives and GM Mosquitoes from a governance
perspective: • There is no clarity on applicability of any
convention/treaty for their governance globally • Although nations have
been trying to develop frameworks and regulatory norms, there are many
unresolved issues ranging from categorization/ classification to
identifying appropriate governance principles. For example should Gene
Drives be classified as LMOs? Should Genome Edited Crops be treated as
similar to crops bred in traditional plant breeding programs or as GMOs
for regulatory purposes. • Are principles like precautionary principle
adequate to develop regulatory regimes [• [Traditional risk assessments
may not be sufficient to]{.mark} fully [understand]{.mark} the **[long
term]{.mark}**s environmental [impacts]{.mark} of these]{.underline} •
[Given]{.underline} the [gaps]{.underline} in knowledge about impacts,
issues on impact assessment methodologies, [there are
uncertainties]{.underline} on assessing their impacts • [They raise
concerns about biosafety and biosecurity and some of these are new and
arise out of their unique and novel features]{.underline}, and, this
includes concerns about DIY bio.3 • Given the wide-ranging applications
in different sectors, is it possible to develop coherent governance
frameworks, which can adapt in tune with technological developments. The
good news is that different stakeholders are aware of these and are
trying to understand the implications. Thus, whether it is National
Academies of Sciences or WHO or professional bodies representing
scientists or Parties to different Conventions/Treaties there are many
initiatives on debating about governance issues and to develop a common
understanding, if not a consensus. For example WHO has established a
"expert advisory committee on Developing global standards for governance
and oversight of Human Genome editing" and it has started functioning.
Parties to The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) are
discussing the implications of advancements in science and technology,
including genome editing for BWTC. A paper submitted by Switzerland
states (BWTC, 2018): "CRISPR t e c h n o l o g y c a n reasonably be
[[expected to]{.underline} [surprise]{.underline}]{.mark} [us
[with]{.mark} new twists and [turns impossible to
predict]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is likely also true for many other
areas, including the above discussed nucleic acid origami, but also
[[for **synth**]{.underline}]{.mark}etic
**[[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}**logy [or the neurosciences]{.underline}.
In this context, it will be important to keep track of scientific and
technological advances, and their potential bearings on the Convention.
At the upcoming MX2, we should hold a technical discussion on genome
editing technologies, and especially CRISPR technology, to then take the
next step towards an assessment of their implications for the Convention
by putting them into the broader context of the 'new era of biology'. In
doing so, we should broaden our traditional focus of 'pathogens causing
disease' to the wider prospects and implications that developments in
the biosciences as a whole may have. Furthermore, technical discussions
should also take into account any intangible aspects (e.g. 'tacit
knowledge') of advances in science and technology, which may
significantly shift initial perceptions about benefits and risks. All of
this will allow for a holistic and more realistic understanding of the
benefits and risks to the Convention" The figure 1 illustrates some of
the concerns on the potential of recent developments in science and
technology. \[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\] According to Diane DiEuliis and James
Giordano (2017): "'[Neurohacking' will increase,]{.underline} [and
**[biotech]{.mark}**nology,]{.underline} such as CRISPR/ Cas and novel
gene editors, will provide tools to realize production of novel
neuroagents with dual-use potential. Simple acknowledgment of these
facts, however, is insufficient. It will be essential to pursue and
obtain a deeper and fuller understanding of the ways that genetic
pathways to human cognitive and behavioral modification [[can be]{.mark}
engaged for dual and direct use as
**[neuroweapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to formulate policies based on
this level of understanding, and to engage surveillance of the use of
these technologies in various silos of development and application, so
as to afford both preventive and more preparatory capabilities" (Pp.
300-301) For obvious reasons, 'creating' babies through genome editing
with enhanced traits or similar application have created a mixed
feeling, from awe and wonder, to repulsion and shock. Even as nations
struggle to regulate genome editing in health sector, the [[absence
of]{.mark} international [norms]{.mark} for governance can [result
in]{.mark} tricky situations and [unanticipated]{.mark} turn of
[events]{.mark}]{.underline}. While giving an example of such a tricky
situation, Dounda and Sternberg (2017), suggest that international
governance is a better solution, by pointing out: "A cautionary tale on
the risks of inaction can already be seen with a related assisted
reproductive technology known as mitochondrial replacement therapy,
which is being developed but is not yet clinically approved in the US.
In a recent case, however, a New York physician exported genetically
modified embryos to Mexico for implantation, specifically to evade US
restrictions. Imagine the type of industry that might result if the
intent were not to produce an embryo free of genetic disease, but an
embryo with a genetic enhancement enabled by CRISPR. Robust
international governance could discourage this kind of medical tourism,
assure equal protection for the citizens of all nations, set
international gene editing standards for scientists and companies, and
help prevent trade disputes with gene-edited foods. The challenge is
determining what mechanism of international convergence is actually
possible, given the substantial legal differences that are already in
place across the globe on issues like GMOs and genetic modification of
human embryos." Given the challenges in developing governance norms and
principles for these emerging technologies is there a role [for Science
Diplomacy]{.underline} in helping countries to develop governance
frameworks and arrive at commonly agreed principles, if not a consensus?
The answer is YES. [**[Science Diplomacy]{.mark}** can play key role
as]{.underline} 'Science for Diplomacy' and '[Diplomacy for Science'
[can **play a vital role**]{.mark} in [bringing]{.mark} together
[scientists]{.mark}, regulators [and policy]{.mark} makers]{.underline}
by **[acting [as interfaces and]{.mark} help in [building
bridges]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is not important that countries
should start with a common understanding or with shared objectives. But
[through deliberations, countries can at least find out points they
agree fully, points they totally disagree and points they agree and
disagree with a give and take attitude. Science diplomacy can help
countries in identifying these points and identify how their respective
positions are shaped by these points.]{.underline} For example with
respect to human genome editing for reproductive purposes, [[countries
can]{.mark} at least [agree on what they]{.mark} want to
[prohibit]{.mark}]{.underline} at all costs and how they will ensure
that, In arriving at such a common position, [science diplomacy can play
a vital role when scientists and diplomats work together towards
this]{.underline}. [While scientists can rely on positions taken by
National Academies and ethical guidelines in vogue in the respective
countries, diplomats can negotiate on developing flexible positions and
norms that are beyond any bargain or compromise]{.underline}. [[Mutual
interactions]{.mark} among them will [enable]{.mark} a better
understanding that can be used to arrive at a [shared
understanding]{.mark} for further deliberations]{.underline}. Through
track II diplomacy, other stakeholders can contribute to further
progress on developing such an understanding. On the other hand Science
Diplomacy can be part of track II diplomacy although it may not be very
visible. If we conceptualize that Science Diplomacy is a broad activity
that goes beyond closed doors of forums for negotiations, and,
activities of scientists and diplomats, then we have to consider the
role of, inter alia, non-state actors, and, civil society in activities
related to developing norms for governance. Given the importance of
public engagement and public participation, [[Science Diplomacy
can]{.underline}]{.mark} facilitate that by
**[[engag]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing with other [[stakeholders]{.mark}
directly or indirectly]{.underline}. For example while in many of the
Conference of Parties and Meeting of Parties (COPMOP) , civil society
groups and others that are recognized, can participate as observers ,
their influence among the public and their role in shaping public
opinion also has to be taken into account. Science Diplomacy can be
useful in engaging with them as observers as well as [interfaces between
public on one hand, and, scientists and policy makers, on the other
hand]{.underline}. Obviously the tasks are not easy and there are many
challenges. Although there can be a consensus translating that into a
binding agreement or treaty is not easy. As these technologies have
biosafety and biosecurity concerns, it is likely that Parties to BWTC
will address those concerns as far as BWTC is concerned. Similarly some
of the concerns relating to environmental impacts, long term impacts,
and risk assessment can be addressed through deliberations by Parties of
CBD/ CPB, which might result in changes/ additions/revisions in CBD/CPB.
The WHO's expert advisory committee can develop guidelines to regulate
genome editing for health/population related purposes. Dounda and
Sternberg have identified some relevant initiatives in governance of
genome editing. Thus there is scope for using health diplomacy,
environmental diplomacy and perhaps innovation diplomacy in moving
towards governance norms for these technologies.

#### Bioterror is existential -- deskilling, globalization, dual use and novel diseases 

**Kellenborn 23** (Zachary Kallenborn, associate professor and associate
dean at the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and

[Even more than]{.underline} the fundamental [efficacy]{.underline} of
these new tools, [it is the [deskilling]{.mark} that they engender that
[is central to]{.mark} their [threat]{.mark} potential in the terrorist
context.]{.underline} [[As]{.underline}]{.mark} these
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies [[advance]{.underline}]{.mark},
the [[levels of]{.mark} education, technical [skill and experience
required to engineer]{.mark} a microorganism [are
reduced]{.mark}.]{.underline} 28 For example, in 2017, a relatively
small Canadian biotechnology company called Tonix synthesised the
horsepox virus, Footnote29 which is harmless to humans but is in the
same family as smallpox, which decidedly is not. At the same time,
[**[globalising forces]{.mark}** such as online education, marketplaces
for used laboratory equipment and lowering costs of equipment
[mean]{.mark} that this **[deskilling can rapidly spread]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} even the most unstable regions of the world where
[terrorists]{.mark} and other violent groups thrive,]{.underline} thus
further "democratising" the technology. Footnote30 As an example, the
International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition brings
together hundreds of teams of high school and undergraduate students
annually from all over the world, and the winning entries represent
levels of sophistication that several years ago were the exclusive
domain of experienced personnel in advanced laboratories. Footnote31
Moreover, [advances in **[biotech]{.mark}**nology [are inherently **dual
use**]{.mark}, and, unlike nuclear weapons technology, they have
multiple beneficial applications (especially in fighting disease)
[and]{.mark} employ techniques that [quickly become
ubiquitous]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It is feared that these [factors]{.underline}, [resulting
from]{.underline} the [enormous strides in]{.underline} **[[modern
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology, [will [allow
adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}, even at the level of [small [non-state
groups or]{.mark} perhaps [individuals, to]{.mark}
essentially]{.underline} first **[[design a disease capable of
existential]{.mark} levels of [harm]{.mark} and [then produce a
pathogen]{.mark} with the required characteristics [to fit]{.mark} the
design]{.underline}**. Footnote32 Such [an **[engineered
pathogen]{.mark}** could conceivably **[disregard]{.mark}** the
generally observed **[inverse relationship between]{.mark}** a
pathogen's **[lethality and]{.mark}** its
**[transmissibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Footnote33 [Nor would
aspiring world-killers be limited to traditional pathogens: **[novel
harm agents]{.mark}**, ranging from transmissible cancers and
bacteriophages to genetic modifications of neurochemistry, [could also
be]{.mark} [considered]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The key question becomes how likely it is that terrorists or other
misanthropic individuals will be able to realise biotechnology's most
extreme potential for harm. Expert opinion differs. Some regard the
threat as overblown, citing persistent technical obstacles to the
realisation of the capabilities described above, especially for
non-state actors. Footnote34 After all, there is much we still do not
know, especially in the realms of epigenetics, pleiotropic effects (one
gene having multiple effects), polygenes (multiple genes acting in
concert to have an effect) and epistatic (modifier) genes. Others
contend that, "[[As]{.mark} the molecular engineering
[techniques]{.mark} of the synthetic biologist [become more robust and
widespread]{.mark}, the **[probability]{.mark}** of encountering one or
more of these threats [is **approaching
certainty**]{.mark}]{.underline}." Footnote35 A recent study by the
National Academies of Science, Medicine and Engineering described the
bottlenecks to modifying and creating pathogens but acknowledged that
[most if not all of these could be overcome in time]{.underline},
Footnote36 with most observers agreeing that the more complex and exotic
achievements will take longer to arrive. However, [even if all of the
obstacles are not surmountable today, the rapid forward march of
biotechnology suggests that, at some point in the not-too-distant
future, terrorists might be capable of brandishing an existential-level
microbe]{.underline}.

garage, biohackers, lunatics, [terrorists]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} countries
like [Iran and **North Korea** will]{.mark}]{.underline} either
[accidentally or intentionally [unleash a]{.mark}]{.underline} BVP. If
the first **[[bioengineered virus]{.underline}]{.mark}** comes from an
accident or is unleashed by one madman it may fail to spread to pandemic
status. [A worse threat is **North Korea**]{.underline}, Iran, or a
terrorist group [**bioengineering** a virus they release against us in
**multiple locations**]{.underline}, perhaps after they've developed a
vaccine to protect themselves. [For new, bioengineered viruses, however,
[there]{.mark} likely [will be **no immunity or treatment**]{.mark}
available]{.underline}. So [[if]{.mark} a state were to task **[even a
small lab]{.mark}** to [develop a GMO with]{.mark} the "cubed" power of
**[high lethality]{.mark}**, **high [transmissibility]{.mark}**[,

vaccine for the state's use only, [[this]{.mark} state [could]{.mark}
have the **capability to [destroy]{.mark}** many enemies]{.underline}.
Delivered "correctly," [the **devastated population** would not even
know **whom to blame**]{.underline} for the attack. It may seem
irrational for a state to unleash a contagious agent. But it's more
understandable given the ability to launch the attack secretly, without
any identification of responsibility. One could foresee many cases, none
of which is as irrational, say, as the world going to war after a
terrorist assassinated the archduke of a declining state in August 1914.
While we cannot forecast the odds of a BVP, a host of experts believes
it is inevitable. A National Defense University study of the GMO threat
found that "the tools and information required for genetic modification
of microorganisms are readily available worldwide." They are also very
cheap, and "the work can be successfully accomplished by a small cadre
\[of three people\]." This study estimated that the materials and
facilities to weaponize a bioagent would cost about \$250,000. "Compared
to other projects that might be undertaken by governments or private
organizations, the cost of equipping and staffing a laboratory scale
bioprocessing facility is trivial." They concluded that "the potential
for corruption of biotechnology to catastrophic malevolent use is
considerable," with "tangible opportunities for many potential
adversaries to acquire, modify, and then manufacture to scale a
potential GMO pathogen."5 [[A BVP]{.underline}]{.mark} or other

"Collapse" is defined here as a cessation of most economic activity and
the widespread lack of law and order, for a prolonged period of time,
with very high fatalities (millions, more than 10 percent of the

meaning a risk not just of killing millions of people, but potentially
billions, [**wiping out civilization** as we know]{.mark}

kill most of the population (more than 90 percent), causing a collapse
that lasts beyond a few years, with the level of pre-collapse

This section of the article will outline how [**[new
tech]{.mark}**nologies [are]{.mark} having [a **major impact** on
biological weapons]{.mark} by 2030]{.underline}. Before analyzing
specific technologies in more detail, however, the author first wants to
point out that biological weapons not only have a purely military use,
but also, like other weapons of mass destruction, have a particular
impact on politics and society. With a large number of digital devices
connected to the internet, online media, and the peculiarities of social
networks, actors could use the threat or deployment of biological
weapons to spread panic and fear. Allison E. Betus, Michael K.
Jablonski, and Anthony F. Lemieux examine the important role of media in
our increasingly digitalized world as follows:

> Violent acts initiate media coverage, as well as word-of-mouth
> transmission, functioning as a gateway that draws attention to the
> terror group and its messages in a manner that increases the salience
> of the communication; then media provides additional information
> contextualizing the original act. Media coverage may make the group
> initiating the communication look more dangerous or powerful than is
> warranted.32

It is thus becoming increasingly clear that CBRN threats are not only
reflected in new hardware, but also increasingly affect the virtual
information and communication space, as well as the public perception of
a real or perceived threat.

A research paper by the NATO Centre of Excellence Defence Against
Terrorism identifies a countervailing mechanism for the interaction of
terrorism and technological progress. In general, military and civilian
innovations influence each other with a reciprocal push and pull
mechanism. This also benefits nonstate actors, who usually focus on
adapting and refining existing and proven dual-use technology for their
own purposes.33 In addition to easy obtainable dual-use goods, high-tech
equipment and material is mostly stolen from professional armed forces,
bought on the black market, or supplied by state actors. In NATO
Strategic Foresight Analysis: 2017 Report, one of six chapters is
devoted exclusively to future technologies. The report describes, among
other things, the rate of technological advances, the number of
individuals with access to the internet, the potential of adversary
non-state actors' access to new technologies, the international
interconnectedness, the amount of data collected, and an increase in the
number of sensors in the world. At the same time, it is becoming more
difficult for states, international organizations, or other frameworks
to effectively regulate potentially dangerous technologies. This is due,
among other things, to the rise of dual-use devices, effects of
globalization, an increase in the power of the commercial sector, and
the rapid pace of market maturity of new technologies, where democratic
mechanisms can often be slow to react.34

The first tangible technologies under consideration are [user friendly
**[AI]{.mark} applications** and web scrapers]{.underline}, which [can
already **easily [search]{.mark}** large amounts of [information]{.mark}
about a certain online topic]{.underline} on the internet or in a
database, for example about [AI can]{.underline} pathogens. then
theoretically analyze or even [[**interpret** the
results]{.underline}]{.mark}. If no powerful computer hardware is
available, capacity can be rented via cloud services. This intersection
could well be [classified as **digital dual-use**]{.underline}. The
consequence is that [[gene]{.mark} combinations can be [**tested** on
the computer]{.mark} before they are cultivated. This **saves time** and
**resources** and can]{.underline} be used to [[develop]{.mark}
pathogens with **[specific properties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
process of producing a large number of molecules by combining and
varying different chemical components using modern methods also exists
in chemistry.

One of [the **most important** future technologies]{.underline}
described in this article are modern biological applications. These
[include **genetic engineering**, **synthetic biology**, and
**biochemistry**]{.underline}. Again, this is an area of dual-use
research. Genetic engineering is the direct genome manipulation of
organisms, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (**[[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [gene editing]{.underline}
that [is probably one of the **most important** scientific
**breakthroughs** of recent times]{.underline}. Especially in the field
of biological weapons and nonstate actors, [this is a method that can be
**misused** with **serious consequences**]{.underline}. The special
advantage is that, compared to prior methods, it [[provides
**easier**]{.mark}, cheaper, and more [**precise** additions]{.mark} or
removal of parts [of the **genome**]{.mark} while the organism is
alive]{.underline}. Thus, in the future, [[it will be]{.mark} reasonably
[**easy** to turn]{.mark}]{.underline} bacteria,
[[viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}, fungi, plants, and humans [[into
**g**]{.underline}]{.mark}enetically **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**odified
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganism[s]{.underline}.35 In general, [this
field is **well researched** and there are many publications
available]{.underline}, as vaccines, for example, are also being
developed using similar methods. For instance, a research paper on the
synthesis of horsepox was published in 2017. Dr. Tom Inglesby, director
of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health, sees [this]{.underline} as [increasing the risk of
**smallpox synthesis**]{.underline}.36 In the future, it is believed
that despite often grave ethical concerns and attempted political
regulation, research will continue to advance. It is often difficult to
regulate and identify dual-use applications early enough. However,
strategic considerations and scientific great-power competition also
play into this technology, as China, in particular, has recently become
known for advances in genetic engineering, which are often seen as
ethically critical.37

[One of the many different aims of synthetic biology is to produce
**synthetic cells**]{.underline} (i.e., synthetic life). In 2019, a
synthetic bacterium was created for the first time from an artificial
sequence of genomes.38 In this way, even very dangerous bacteria could
theoretically be created as if from a construction kit. Research is
currently being done on this with the aim of producing a synthetic drug
delivery platform.39 However, viruses can also be transported and
distributed by synthetic bacteria. Advances in synthetic virology are
particularly relevant to this study. In the future, it is expected that
[[any virus]{.mark} whose DNA/RNA]{.underline}
(deoxyribonucleic/ribonucleic acid) [is available [can]{.mark}
potentially [be **reverse engineered**]{.mark}, bringing viruses that
have been **eradicated** [back into
**circulation**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Currently, the National Library of Medicine has a large database called
the National Center for Biotechnology Information Virus (NCBI Virus),
which contains the genetic data of nearly all known viruses, as well as
other microorganisms and mammals.40 There is an important report by the
U.S. National Academy of Sciences, commissioned by the U.S. Department
of Defense in 2018, which describes three particularly dangerous
scenarios of [synthetic biology]{.underline}. In addition to the already
described technique of reproducing viruses with genetic code from the
internet, it [[also]{.underline}]{.mark} mentions the [possibility of
[making bacteria **resistant** to **antibiotics**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and the possibility of programming microbes in such a way that they
slowly poison people through their metabolism. The last method could
lead to death after a long time and thus disguise the crime. Much more
difficult to implement, but [theoretically possible]{.underline}, [is
a]{.underline} so-called [**gene drive** that **automatically spreads**
through the population]{.underline}, altering people's DNA.41

The field of biochemistry is also important, as research into, for
example, metabolism processes in cells, signal molecules, or enzymes
must also be considered in the effect of biological weapons. The exact
impact of this area of research up to 2030 cannot be forecasted
precisely, but it is certain that the impact will be significant.

A new development that could potentially have an impact on chemical and
biological weapons is **[[microreactors]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
form of a continuous flow reactor. Fundamentally, the idea is to
[[allow]{.mark} chemical reactions to take place in a **very small
device**. Advantages compared to large reactors include
[**scalability**, on-site]{.mark}]{.underline} and on-demand
[[**production**, as well as]{.mark} a [high]{.mark}]{.underline}
reaction **[[yield]{.underline}]{.mark}**.42 The small reactors can be
scaled up to almost any size, and expensive, large, and complicated
synthesis facilities in batch reactor design are no longer necessary, as
the cult Aum Shinrikyo once built them. A 2013 study, however, stresses
that the use of microreactors for the production of chemical weapons is
limited. Nevertheless, [future technological **advances** may well
enable a **broader range** of warfare agents]{.underline}.43 Advances in
micro-enzymatic reactors are also expected in the field of biology.44
[This could help future **terrorists** or **state actors** to produce
small quantities of toxic agents in almost [**any place** in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} without significantly putting themselves at
risk during production. Although the implications are not yet well
understood, the cultivation of pathogens could also benefit from the
technology.

Current and future often [dual-use developments in
**[nanoscience]{.mark}** also [offer many overlaps]{.mark} with
**biological weapons**]{.underline} and means of delivery. But not only
potentially lethal applications are being developed; nanoscience also
supports modern material sciences, engineering, and production. For some
years now, several armed forces have been researching machines
frequently called nanobots. However, this often refers to insect-size
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which does not correspond to the "nano"
definition. Nevertheless, these [[bionic insects]{.underline}]{.mark},
which are often only 2--3 mm in size and are capable of flying,
[can]{.underline}, for example, [[deliver]{.mark} a highly potent
[poison **unnoticed**]{.mark} to many locations]{.underline}.45 In a
swarm, technical systems could be manipulated, disrupted, or destroyed.
However, real nanobots (i.e., nano-size synthetic drug carriers) are
also not unlikely in the future. For example, a group of Chinese
researchers undertook the first successful tests for targeted tumor
treatment in 2018.46 On the other hand, [such carriers could also be
used for the **targeted transport** of **viruses** and
toxins]{.underline}. Bacteria have been used as drug carriers for
similar applications for some time now. Theoretically, however, it is
also possible to manipulate unmodified or transgenic insects with the
help of nanotechnology, for example to increase the effect of
distributed biological warfare agents.47

Other applications of nanotechnologies are very small computers, which
will be important for small means of delivery and monitoring of
production of biological and chemical warfare agents.48 In general, by
2030, [**nano**-size technologies]{.underline} are expected to [make
**dual-use** the laboratory equipment needed]{.underline} for biological
weapon production, among other things, [**cheaper**, more effective,
smaller, and more **flexible**]{.underline}.49 In addition, future
attacks with **[nanotubes]{.underline}** may [offer entirely new
possibilities for disguising origin and **lethality**]{.underline}. A
researcher at American University explains: "For example, [[nanotubes
could]{.mark} be used to [deliver]{.mark} only the **lethal parts** of
the **[anthrax]{.mark}** virus---without the **signature protein** that
is recognizable to the immune system]{.underline}." The researcher
identifies three main dangers in linking nanoscience and potential
biological weapons. First, rudimentary nanotechnology labs are [already
available on the internet for under \$500 USD]{.underline}. Second, the
technology makes it easier and cheaper to produce, disguise, and
transport biological warfare agents. And third, the technology is not
sufficiently regulated, which could lead to an asymmetric arms race that
threatens the overall strategic security of major countries.50

The devastating impact of COVID-19 has highlighted global
vulnerabilities to high-consequence biological events. The international
community was woefully unprepared for a pandemic that has led to
millions of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses, and has
upended daily life. However, notwithstanding the severe damage caused by
COVID-19, it should be viewed as a warning shot.1 It will not be the
last pandemic humanity faces, and the next high-consequence biological
event could be as destructive or substantially worse.

We define [global **[catastrophic biological risks]{.mark}**
(**GCBRs**)]{.underline} as biological events of tremendous scale that
[could cause **severe damage** to human civilization, potentially
**[jeopardiz]{.mark}ing** its [long-term
**survival**]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 The Johns Hopkins Center for Health
Security has also developed a working definition of GCBRs,3 and this
term is part of a broader discussion about global catastrophic risks
that could arise from a variety of sources, including nuclear war,
anthropogenic climate change, and advanced artificial intelligence that
has not been sufficiently safeguarded.4,5 [GCBRs could be caused
by]{.underline} a naturally emerging infectious disease outbreak, an
accidental release of a pathogen, or [a **deliberate
attack**]{.underline}. Naturally emerging infectious disease outbreaks
that can grow into pandemics are likely to increase in frequency due to
urbanization, globalization, and environmental degradation, and [the
world faces an **increasing risk** of]{.underline} high-consequence
biological events resulting from [accidental or **deliberate misuse** of
the tools of modern bioscience and **biotechnology**]{.underline}.6-8
Not all outbreaks or global pandemics will grow to the scale of a GCBR
as we define it in this article and as others have defined global
catastrophic risks more broadly, because the threshold for this type of
event is extremely high.

Although COVID-19 does not rise to the level of a GCBR-scale event, it
has demonstrated that a biological event can have a devastating global
impact, and it should serve as a warning to global leaders that the
world needs much more robust protections against high-consequence
biological events that could emerge in the future and be substantially
worse.

In our view, [human-caused biological [events
involving]{.mark}]{.underline} the accidental or deliberate mis[use of
[an **engineered pathogen** are **more likely**]{.mark} to lead to a
GCBR-scale event]{.underline} than a naturally emerging pandemic.9
[Scientists have the capacity to]{.underline} deliberately or
inadvertently [**engineer pathogens** that are more virulent and
transmissible than what nature creates]{.underline} by chance, [and the
**upper limit** of damage]{.underline} that could be caused by a
human-engineered biological event is **[unknown]{.underline}**.10-12
Prevention, early detection, and rapid response are all crucial for
guarding against GCBR-scale events. However, in this article, we focus
on effective strategies for preventing biological events that could
become GCBRs, specifically by disincentivizing development and use of
biological weapons by states and other powerful actors.

Work to prevent the development and use of biological weapons is
crucial. While biotechnology advances offer tremendous potential
benefits---including improvements in public health, economic
development, and climate change---[[rapidly **advancing
capabilities**]{.mark} to manipulate biological systems
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[making it **easier** to
engineer]{.mark} increasingly sophisticated **biological
[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}.5,13 These advances are making it
possible [[for a **wider range** of actors]{.underline}]{.mark} to
exploit biology [to cause **catastrophic harm**]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, the devastation caused by [COVID-19 may have
**exacerbated this** vulnerability by making **biological weapons** more
attractive]{.underline} as a means to achieve political, economic, or
other more radical objectives.14

Two types of actors could pose important risks to bioweapons development
and use: states and nonstate actors. Any effective strategy for
countering these risks will ultimately need to reduce the likelihood
that an actor will have both the capability and intention to develop
and/or use a biological weapon that could cause a GCBR-scale event.

To prevent the development and use of biological weapons by nonstate
actors, the most effective strategy is to constrain their capabilities
to cause catastrophic harm. Nonstate actors are not typically motivated
by the same rational economic, political, and military goals that
incentivize states, and they may have an apocalyptic vision aligned with
using biological weapons to cause global catastrophic harm. Lawrence
Kerr has noted that "at one point in time, there were 3,000 named
apocalyptic groups around the world," including terrorists "solely
interested in annihilation of humans."15 It is fair to assume that some
of these groups would readily use biology to cause globally catastrophic
harm if given the opportunity.16 Aum Shinrikyo is an example of an
apocalyptic cult that pursued the development of chemical and biological
weapons, making several attempts to carry out large-scale biological
attacks in Japan in the 1990s; fortunately they were unsuccessful.17
Importantly, nonstate actors usually lack the resources of states,
especially in terms of trained personnel and financial assets, which
makes it feasible to constrain their capabilities by denying them access
to materials, equipment, and the technical expertise needed to develop
or acquire biological weapons. This strategy can be achieved by
safeguarding the tools of modern bioscience and biotechnology to prevent
their exploitation by malicious actors.18-21

In contrast, many [nation [states have **substantial**]{.mark}
**financial [resources]{.mark}** at their disposal [and]{.mark} access
to **trained [personnel]{.mark}**[, which makes]{.mark} it extremely
difficult and perhaps even [**impossible to constrain** their
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} to develop and use powerful biological
weapons. In our view, a much more effective strategy for preventing the
development and use of biological weapons by states is to make the
potential costs of bioweapons development unacceptably high and to
diminish any perceived benefits.9 Although some states may see potential
tactical or strategic benefits of developing biological weapons---or
even using them in some cases---they generally have rational political,
economic, and military objectives that would not be well served by
deliberately causing a GCBR. Nevertheless, [bioweapons development can
have unintended consequences---including accidental release of a highly
transmissible, deadly biological agent]{.underline}---and [[any]{.mark}
attempt at **[targeted]{.mark} bioweapons [use]{.mark}** [could result
in a]{.mark} much larger and more **[widespread]{.mark} biological
[event]{.mark}** than intended]{.underline}.22 For these reasons, we
contend that state biological weapons programs can and should be
countered with well-designed incentive structures.23 Designing and
building such structures is the focus of this article.

Second, and more importantly, no adversary could wisely assume
otherwise. [[If a **biological attack**]{.mark} of the type posited
above **[were]{.mark} successfully [conducted]{.mark}** at some distant
date]{.underline}---no one is close to being able to conduct it now,

Because [a **nuclear strike** could]{.mark} in fact [be carried]{.mark}
out [with **greater precision**]{.mark}]{.underline} than a biological
attack, the response could in fact be somewhat less severe and

[credibility]{.mark}** to the **likelihood** that it would be

### 2AC Science solves your disads

#### Science is a conflict dampener -- all disads are less likely in the world of science diplomacy. 

Paul **Dziatkowiec** (Director of Mediation and Peace Support at the
Geneva Centre for Security Policy, and creator and facilitator of the
High North Talks) "Diplomatic Deadlock in the Arctic: Science as an
entry point to renewed dialogue" **2023**
https://arcticyearbook.com/images/yearbook/2023/Commentaries/3C_Dziatkowiec_AY2023.pdf -
Accessed 06/30/2025 //KSH

In the decades since the end of the Cold War, [[science has regularly
been]{.underline}]{.mark} depicted as [[an entry point to dialogue aimed
at alleviating political conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} or diplomatic
tensions. Science is after all not politics; it is a universal good, a
common language, and a shared value; moreover, it is grounded in
widely-agreed fact rather than opinion, which means that - at least in
theory - it is less prone to ideological influence. [Even during the
Cold War, [science diplomacy helped to maintain threads of
communication]{.mark}]{.underline} across ideological divides, and
provided the vehicle and substance for dialogue (see for example Davis &
Patman (eds), 2015). Thanks to science diplomacy, despite geopolitical
tensions the superpowers were able to find common ground and work
together where they perceived a mutual interest or a shared threat.
[[Convergence around the language of science]{.underline}]{.mark} may
have [[helped]{.mark}]{.underline} them to [[avert]{.underline}]{.mark}
an even greater rupture, and perhaps [[more dangerous
escalations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Regrettably today's geopolitical
climate appears to be less amenable to constructive exchange and joint,
pragmatic problem-solving. Russia's brutal attack on Ukraine triggered
an enormous counterreaction that has led to the severing of West-Russia
communications on multifarious international issues and in various
regions, including the High North. As such, the Arctic is fast becoming
a new theatre for great power politics. The recent sharpening of
geopolitical tensions introduces new unknown variables into the
international security landscape, and affects a broad gamut of issues on
which West-Russia coordination was once taken for granted, including
science. [[Without constructive communication]{.underline} -]{.mark}
which has almost completely ceased - there are risks that
misunderstandings, [[miscalculations,]{.underline} or]{.mark} simple
neglect [[may lead to an environmental disaster or a dangerous new
conflagration]{.underline}.]{.mark} In the absence of an adequate forum
for addressing the urgent threats facing the Arctic, in 2022 the Geneva
Centre for Security Policy (GCSP) launched a discreet dialogue process[,
the 'High North Talks']{.underline}, which has met regularly since. The
Talks [offer an informal platform for discussing]{.underline} - in a
neutral setting - the threats and challenges, potential solutions, and
possible areas of [renewed cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline}.
[Attendees include]{.underline} experts from states with a stake in the
region - [Arctic Council members (including Russia), as well
as]{.underline} other actors like [China]{.underline}, the EU, Japan and
India. In the context of Russia's attack on Ukraine, the High North
Talks explore how Arctic affairs could be managed more effectively in
spite of the geopolitical turbulence. The Talks constitute one of the
few remaining venues where representatives from the countries most
invested in the Arctic can meet, in a safe and discreet environment, to
discuss the future of this region. One of [[the most urgent
topic]{.underline}s]{.mark} [[is the need to
restore]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[meaningful
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} between the West and Russia, at least
on the most pressing issues like climate change monitoring. While the
rationale for the West's response to Russian aggression in Ukraine is
clear and understood, it is crucial that ways be found - perhaps
[[through policies that allow for targeted
coordination]{.underline}]{.mark} in 'exceptional' cases - to manage
ongoing problems of global significance.

Arctic science without the US and Russia

[[The field of **Arctic science** is]{.mark} particularly
**[vulnerable]{.mark}** after Russia **invaded
[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} three years ago. Following the
full-scale attack, [all **Arctic science** cooperation with the country
was **lost**]{.underline}. As Russia constitutes half of the Arctic,
[the war has also [**significantly** impacted **polar science**]{.mark}.
Arctic science **[cooperation]{.mark}** efforts]{.underline},
particularly regarding environmental surveillance, [have [now lacked
**50% of the data**]{.mark} for three years]{.underline}.

[Now that [the US is **taking steps** to **diminish** its role]{.mark}
in Arctic science, [this creates a **void**]{.mark} that others are
**eager to fill**, such as **China**.]{.underline}

Many [researchers believe **science** to be **China\'s way** into the
**Arctic**]{.underline}. In an HNN article from October 2024, researcher
Tim Reilly from the University of Cambridge emphasized how [China
utilizes **scientific motives** to **access** the region]{.underline}.
He explained [that China is **gathering** some of the **best** Arctic
climate **Big Data**, establishing itself as a **major
player**]{.underline} in the region.

Bennett also believes that the [current **US strategy** toward polar
research **bodes well** for China:]{.underline}

\"[China has already **risen** quickly as a scientific **powerhouse** in
the polar regions]{.underline} since the beginning of the 2000s. [With
Russia and the US both **out of the picture** so to speak, China will
have **ample** opportunities to fund and **lead** Arctic
**research**]{.underline},\" she says and continues:

\"However, lacking Arctic territory and facing varying challenges in
collaboration with the other six Arctic states besides the US and
Russia, Chinese research in the Arctic may focus on oceanography,
atmospheric studies, and other research that can take place in the
global commons rather than on land. If it continues to face challenges
accessing Arctic territory, China may also work to further popularize
Arctic research based on remote methods like satellite imaging.\"

\"[[With the US administration **waging a war** on Arctic research,
**especially** in relation to **climate**]{.mark} and **Indigenous
Peoples**, and observations in Russia basically
**unobtainable**]{.underline} except through remote sensing, [[it will
be **tremendously challenging** to maintain]{.mark} robust
**pan-[Arctic]{.mark}** [observing networks]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
have been so important to building a better understanding of the Arctic
at a regional scale since at least the end of the Cold War,\" Bennett
concludes.

Marisa Palucis, reflecting on her Arctic research trips, shared insights
into the delicate balance of the Arctic landscape.

She recounted witnessing the dramatic break-off of a chunk of bedrock,
an event triggered by the seemingly minor act of water flow, emphasizing
the profound impact even small changes can have on this cold-adapted
environment.

of his regime, on the Kremlin's growing authoritarian tendencies at home
and the poisoning of opposition figures, on Russia's nuclear arsenal and
cyber capabilities, or on Russia's projection of power abroad, from
election interference to military interventions in Ukraine and Syria.
Rarely does climate change make the shortlist. Yet it is climate change,
as much as any one politician or set of policies, that will exert the
strongest force on Russia's strategic future, reshaping its politics,
economy, and society for decades to come.

Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the rest of the world. In 2020,
regions across Russia have experienced the hottest temperatures on
record, contributing to forest fires that burned through acreage the
size of Greece and emitted one-third more carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere than in 2019 (Russian forests account for one-fifth of the
world's total). Flash floods in Siberia destroyed entire villages and
displaced thousands of residents. Snow coverage was at a record low in
2020, and Arctic sea ice coverage shrank to its second-lowest extent in
over 40 years.

[[Permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}, which covers nearly two-thirds of
Russian territory, [[is **rapidly thawing**]{.underline}]{.mark}. More
dramatic freeze-thaw cycles in the subsoil are eroding urban
infrastructure in Russia's Arctic cities, home to over 2 million people,
and pose a mounting risk to Russia's 200,000 kilometers of oil and gas
pipelines, not to mention thousands of miles of roads and rail lines
bridging some of Russia's widest rivers. Permafrost thaw recently
toppled a diesel storage tank near the Arctic city of Norilsk, spilling
21,000 tons of diesel into the Ambarnaya river and surrounding subsoil.
[It has been linked [to]{.mark} **outbreaks** of **anthrax** and the
discovery of [vast **methane craters**]{.mark}. At [its **current rate**
of thaw]{.mark}]{.underline}---about 1 degree Celsius per
decade---Russia's [permafrost layer will **stop freezing** completely in
three decades]{.underline}. This [[could result in a]{.mark} potentially
[**catastrophic**, one-off release of carbon]{.mark} into the
atmosphere]{.underline} which will no longer be Russia's problem alone.
According to one study, [a 30 to **99 percent** reduction in
near-surface **permafrost** would release an additional 10 to **240
billion tons** of **carbon** and methane into the **atmosphere** [and
potentially put the globe "**over the brink**"]{.mark} by
2100.]{.underline} Russia is already the fourth-largest emitter of
greenhouse gases, accounting for 4.6 percent of all global emissions.
Its per capita emissions are among the highest in the world---53 percent
higher than China, and 79 percent higher than the European Union.

[[Dramatic **shifts** in]{.mark} **global [weather]{.mark}**
patterns]{.underline}, accelerated by warming Arctic waters and a
diminishing ice cap, [[are expected to increase **droughts**]{.mark} in
Russia's rich southern agricultural "bread basket"]{.underline} regions
encompassing Stavropol and Rostov. [This could pose **food security**
risks and threaten a primary **Russian export**: wheat. Though [climate
change will **expand** arable land]{.mark} in Russia [in]{.mark} its
**[northern latitudes]{.mark}**, the northern topsoil tends to be
**thinner** and more **acidic**]{.underline} than in Russia's most
productive southern regions and would not make up for its losses. In
fact, arable land shrank by more than half to just 120,000 acres in
2017. In June of this year, regional officials in Stravopol, one of
Russia's major wheat regions, projected a remarkable 40 percent decline
in wheat crop in 2020 as a result of droughts. [This too has global
implications: Russia is a **core** part of **global food** chains,
accounting for **20 percent** of **global wheat** exports]{.underline},
so climate disruption to Russian agricultural output will have strong
effects well beyond Russia's borders and budget coffers. As agriculture
shifts north, scientists are concerned that [[the]{.mark} cultivation of
[**carbon-rich soils** will create a separate]{.mark} **carbon
[feedback]{.mark}** [loop and **expedite**]{.mark} global

### 2AC -- Black Carbon Extension

#### [Black Carbon]{.underline}\-\--continued emissions cause [runaway]{.underline} ice melt and [warming]{.underline}.

cleaner shipping," Dialogue Earth,

njn; accessed 6-18-2025\]

Shipping is a highly polluting industry. Between 2007 and 2012, it was
responsible for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions from
fossil fuel use and industrial processes, or around one billion tonnes
of CO2 equivalent per year. [[Ship exhaust]{.mark} may also [contain
"**black carbon**"]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [sooty particles
[that]{.mark} absorb sunlight and **[trap heat]{.mark}** in the
atmosphere, [contributing to]{.mark} global [**warming**. Black carbon
**rapidly accelerates** ice **melt**]{.mark}]{.underline} when it lands,
[by darkening surfaces and thus **reducing** how much **sunlight they
reflect**]{.underline}. At the same time it poses a serious health risk
to coastal communities. Environmental groups [say [this climate]{.mark}
and health [threat could **easily be eradicated**]{.mark} if ships were
forced to use cleaner fuels]{.underline}. The impact on warming [Black
carbon is produced when ships burn **heavy fuel oil**]{.underline},
which is "a hazardous, toxic tar-like fuel", says Andrew Dumbrille, an
advisor to both the Clean Arctic Alliance, a group of 20 nonprofits, and
to the Inuit Circumpolar Council, which represents all Inuit from
Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Chukotka on internationally important
matters. "[It is literally the stuff at the **bottom of the
barrel**]{.underline}," he says. "You have to heat it up to use it...
[it's like **burning tar**, one could walk on it]{.underline}," he says.
"Our global trade system is enabled by this highly polluting by-product
fuel." [Black carbon emissions are **responsible** for around 20% of the
shipping industry's **climate impact**]{.underline} over a 20-year
period, according to the Clean Arctic Alliance. [[It is "**especially
damaging**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and has a disproportionate impact,
[[when]{.mark} it is [released in]{.mark} or near [the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}," says Sian Prior, lead adviser to the
alliance. [[The Arctic is already warming]{.mark} almost [**four times**
faster]{.mark} than the global average]{.underline}, at 0.73C per decade
compared to the global average of 0.19C per decade between 1979--2021,
according to a 2022 study by Finnish researchers. "When black carbon
settles in the polar environment... the surface starts absorbing more
and more heat because it's dark," says Prior. "So [[you lose the
**albedo**]{.mark} **effect**, [which is the **reflectivity**]{.mark} of
the snow and the ice]{.underline}." [[This leads to a **vicious
cycle**]{.mark} of warming. **[Less]{.mark} sea [ice]{.mark}** [means
more]{.mark} open, [**dark ocean** which absorbs **more heat**]{.mark}
and accelerates]{.underline} temperature rise, not just in the Arctic
but [worldwide]{.underline}. "Some of that warming is going to be
transported further south," says Pam Pearson, director of the
International Cryosphere Climate Initiative. "[So a warmer Arctic also
translates into warmer **mid-latitudes** because of **black
carbon**]{.underline}." If the Arctic sea ice melts completely during
the summer, there is going to be "so much more sea level rise and
extreme weather globally," says Pearson. A 2021 report by the Climate
Crisis Advisory Group warned that [[the Arctic is "**ground zero**" for
**cascading climate** impacts across the planet.]{.mark} **[Rising
temp]{.mark}erature[s]{.mark}** [there]{.mark}]{.underline} are leading
to warmer ocean temperatures and shifts in atmospheric circulation, and
[are expected to [**weaken** the **jet stream**, leading to]{.mark} more
**[extreme weather]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Arctic Key (Methane and Black Carbon) 

#### Arctic key to solving methane

**Prior and Dumbrille 2025.** Dr Sian Prior is Lead Adviser to the Clean
Arctic Alliance, a coalition campaigning to persuade governments to take
action to protect the Arctic, its wildlife and its people. Andrew
Dumbrille is the North American advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance and
co-founder of Equal Routes, a new non-profit centering communities and
rights holders to create a sustainable and equitable marine shipping
sector.

The Clean Arctic Alliance is calling for the Arctic Council, under
Norway's leadership, to adopt new ambitious targets that will reduce
emissions of [black carbon and methane. Slashing emissions of these two
short-lived climate forcers would provide an urgently needed response to
the climate crisis]{.underline}, while [a 'business as usual' approach
will ensure the continued loss of Arctic sea ice and severe climate
disruption in the region.]{.underline} Three years ago, the UN
Secretary-General António Guterres warned that "[we are on a fast track
to climate disaster.]{.underline} Major cities underwater[,
unprecedented heatwaves]{.underline}, terrifying storms, [widespread
water shortages. The extinction of a million species of plants and
animals.]{.underline} This is not fiction or exaggeration. [It is what
science tells us from our current energy policies." Nowhere are these
impacts being felt more strongly than in the Arctic.]{.underline} The
6th Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
predicts "[the likelihood and impact of abrupt and / or irreversible
changes in the climate system, including changes triggered when tipping
points are reached, increase with further global warming. And as warming
levels increase, so do the risks of species extinction or irreversible
loss of biodiversity]{.underline} in ecosystems including forests, coral
reefs and in Arctic regions." [With the Arctic warming now four times
faster than the rest of the planet and black carbon emitted in or near
the Arctic being five times more potent a climate pollutant than when
emitted outside the Arctic, the Arctic]{.underline} Council [must
act]{.underline} with vigour and ambition. Arctic Black Carbon Emissions
In 2017, the Arctic Council -- the intergovernmental body that promotes
cooperation, coordination and interaction among the Arctic States
(Canada, Denmark -- including Greenland and the Faeroe Islands --
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, United States) and with
Indigenous Peoples agreed an ambitious target to reduce emissions of
black carbon (soot). The council aimed to bring this short lived and
highly potent climate forcer down by 25-33 per cent below 2013 emission
levels by 2025. It is now 2025, and under the Norwegian Chair, the
Arctic Council is on the verge of locking in a new black carbon
emissions reduction target for all sectors in the Arctic. [Setting a new
target is crucial for future reduction of black carbon emissions for all
sectors in the Arctic,]{.underline} including shipping. According to the
Arctic Council's Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme, the 2017
target of cutting black carbon emissions by 25% (compared to 2013
levels) is likely to be achieved by 2025 provided current reduction
trends continue. However, [shipping emissions are a different story and
have not only failed to reduce in line with the original target but have
more than doubled in recent years.]{.underline} When Arctic Council
Ministers adopt a new black carbon reduction milestone this May[, it
will have profound consequences for decades; failure to agree on a more
ambitious target will mean missing an important opportunity to address a
potent climate and biodiversity threat. This will have serious
implications for the global climate.]{.underline} Beforehand,
behind-the-scenes discussions involving technical experts including the
Arctic Council's Expert Group on Black Carbon and Methane (EGBCM) will
take place -- on January 15 and 17th. The EGBCM mandate is drawn from
the Arctic Council's 2015 framework for actions on black carbon and
methane, and is tasked with providing summary reports on these
pollutants and marshalling action and progress to reduce their impact.
Its current work plan includes a process to update the current black
carbon reduction target. The global climate crisis has driven more than
2.5 degrees heating in the Arctic. Unprecedented changes, such as the
loss of Arctic sea ice, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet,
permafrost thawing, rising ocean temperatures, and increasing
acidification are occurring at alarming rates. The reduction in sea ice
extent and thickness is driving a social and environmental crisis in the
Arctic, which is having repercussions further south. The IPCC's 2023 AR6
report saw the UN's climate science panel of experts highlight -- with
high confidence -- that the rise in extreme weather and climate events
is intensifying acute food insecurity for Arctic communities. A
realistic Arctic Council response to the crisis facing the Arctic means
achieving a cross-sectoral target of somewhere in the neighbourhood of
50% by 2030 and 80% by 2035 from 2013 levels, while the shipping sector
will need to reduce black carbon emissions by 75% by 2030 and 95% by
2035. Shipping Sector Action The Clean Arctic Alliance proposes a
stronger target for the shipping sector due to 20% of shipping's climate
impact coming from black carbon. Achieving a significant reduction in
black carbon emissions by ships can be achieved by simply switching to
cleaner distillate fuels and installing diesel particulate filters
(which can only be used with cleaner fuels). This would ensure a 95% or
greater reduction in black carbon emissions from ships. As a credible
global reference point, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, convened by
the UN Environment Program, has set a target of global black carbon
reductions of 80% by 2030. However, a new Arctic Council target alone
won't guarantee reductions -- associated measures and solutions need to
deliver the targets in the Arctic. Because of the significant reductions
in black carbon emissions that can be achieved by switching ships away
from heavy fuel oil (HFO) to cleaner fuels, the defining of polar fuels
and mandatory use of distillate fuels should be a first priority --
followed by the installation of Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs). Other
measures will also deliver complementary results -- designation of
Emission Control Areas (ECAs), a ban on the use of scrubbers which
circumvent the global requirement to use low-sulphur fuels, and full and
rapid implementation of the Arctic HFO ban. Methane Emissions The EGBCM
has a dual mandate; there is a huge urgency to address increasing
methane emissions and their impacts in the Arctic. Methane provides 30%
of the global climate problem -- and emissions are on the rise. Methane
impacts are amplified in the Arctic due to melting glaciers exposing
large deposits of leaking methane gas. Methane released from thawing
permafrost and emitted by industrial sources have led some to describe
the situation as a ticking methane bomb. The Arctic Council must take
more concrete action on methane and at the very least align with the
Global Methane Pledge (backed by more than 150 countries), and given the
accelerated climate impacts in the Arctic aim for a higher ambition
striving for reductions of 40% by 2030 from 2020 levels. Civil society
has also initiated a new framework for action on methane which should be
supported and championed by all Arctic Council members, the Beyond
Methane Pledge focuses on rapidly phasing out methane based Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) as a marine fuel. Both black carbon and methane not
only contribute to the worsening of the climate crisis, but also to
increased local air pollution and biodiversity loss. Both pollutants
drive Arctic warming, which causes the melting of snow and ice --
negatively impacting the Arctic climate biodiversity and food security,
while driving climate change in areas outside the Arctic. These
emissions also contribute to negative health consequences for
communities and increased air pollution. Reducing emissions of both
black carbon and methane is imperative for all sectors, none less than
the shipping sector, given that emissions of both methane and black
carbon in the Arctic are currently on the increase. Cutting emissions
would give the shipping industry a strong role in the response to the
triple planetary crisis by simultaneously addressing climate change,
rising pollution, and biodiversity loss. In May, the Arctic Council must
embrace ambitious targets for reducing emissions on short-lived climate
forcers, especially black carbon. Doing so will give the Arctic and its
peoples a fighting chance for survival. Deliberations and negotiations
en route must not compromise the ambition for reduction targets that can
do the job.

China May Realize It Is Often Its Own Worst Enemy in the Arctic Although
a particularly aggressive style of [Chinese
diplomacy]{.underline}---dubbed the Wolf Warrior diplomacy after a
successful Chinese movie franchise---[has not played out particularly
well in the Arctic, as evidenced by China's checkered bilateral
relations with several Arctic states]{.underline}, [[China might change
its approach to make its presence and influence more palatable, if given
sufficient incentives]{.mark} to do so]{.underline}.109 To some extent,
[it has already started doing so, showing a clear ability to "step back"
when its efforts in the Arctic met with suspicion or
hostility]{.underline}, par- ticularly with those countries that are
also U.S. allies.110 [[China]{.mark} has also been careful not to appear
to directly threaten the strategic interests of various Arctic
states]{.underline}. During the con- troversy over a Chinese company's
bid over the airport renovation contract in Greenland, a high-ranking
Chinese general asserted that "China has a one-Denmark policy," possibly
to reassure Copenhagen that China's ambition is not to help Greenland on
its path to indepen- dence.111 This relative "tactical retreat," in the
words of Camilla T. N. Sørensen, comes at a small cost for China,
because the Arctic is not currently a top strategic priority in
comparison to other more pressing matters.112 [[Tactical
retreat]{.mark}, however, [might also be part of a longer- term
approach]{.mark} of "non-contention" [that emphasizes]{.mark} instead
[cooperation]{.mark} to reach more effec- tively one's strategic
objectives]{.underline}.113 [China could also foster goodwill on the
part of Arctic states and populations by showing more effectively that
it adds value for the region]{.underline}.114 If it was able to deliver
on its promises to improve the common good in the Arctic through efforts
related to search and rescue (SAR) or the protection of the environment,
for instance, there might be less of a resistance on the part of both
national and local actors to welcome Chinese participation in various
activi- ties on their territory. [[China has already started doing so by
framing its involvement in the Arctic as responsible, environmentally
conscious, and sustainability minded]{.underline}]{.mark}, as evidenced,
for instance, in the language it uses in its 2018 Arctic Policy.115
Providing new technologies to help solve some issues particularly
salient for the Arctic might be another way to reach that goal. [[China
already perceives technological advances as a mean to develop its
relations with Arctic states and present itself as an involved, useful,
and responsible Arctic stakeholder]{.underline}]{.mark}.116 Camilla T.
N. Sørensen and Christopher Weidacher Hsiung noted that due to the
difficulty of operating in the Arctic, "[[improvement of knowledge and
technology are . . . always in demand among Arctic states]{.mark} and
other Arctic stakeholders]{.underline}, and [[there is a room to
manoeuvre here for China]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}."117 As of
late 2022, China was still behind most Arctic countries when it comes to
polar-capable technologies (for appli- cations ranging from
transportation to drilling under Arctic conditions), [[other important
domains, such as decarbonization technologies, could be particularly
appealing to Arctic states and populations grappling with the
consequences of climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}.118 [[The issue of
black carbon emissions, which are particularly problematic in the
Arctic, is a domain where]{.mark} China has been particularly involved
within the Arctic Council]{.underline}.119 [[China is
knowledgeable]{.mark} in other Arctic-relevant technologies, such as
permafrost engineering, [that it could use to present itself as a
valuable partner in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.120

### 2AC -- Co-Op Try or Die 

#### China is willing to cooperate on climate issues with Arctic nations, absent US engagement, it risks ceding the Arctic to China

**Guo and Chen 2023**. Guo Peiqing is a Professor at the School of
International Affairs and Public Administration, Ocean University of
China. Chen Huiwen is a Ph.D. candidate of the College of Foreign
Languages, Ocean University of China."Chinese Perspective on the Arctic
and its Implication for Nordic Countries"

Core Values of the China's Arctic Policy [To achieve mutual development
through win-win cooperation is the first aim of Chinese Arctic
policy]{.underline}. China and the Nordic countries are highly
complementary in terms of economic structure. China is an important
manufacturing country with strong infrastructure capacity and is the
world's largest consumer market. As for the Nordic countries, the pillar
industries are animal husbandry, fisheries, shipping, resource
extraction, high-tech manufacturing, and tourism. China and Nordic
countries are complementary in the international industrial and supply
chains and there is no competition. In China's Arctic Policy published
in 2018, [China systematically elaborates the objectives, principles and
policy propositions of China's participation in Arctic affairs.
Cooperation and mutual benefits are the basic position of China. Unlike
the U.S. dichotomy of "friend or foe" and the confrontational mindset of
"lose or win," China]{.underline} bases its policy on its long-history
of Confucian culture and peace-harmony gene and [does not force Nordic
countries to take sides between China and the United States, but
advocates the concept of "making friends with the world" and aims for
win-win results]{.underline}.4) China [advocates solidarity, mutual
assistance and sharing the same boat, likes working together with other
countries on Arctic climate, scientific research and trade issues, and
hopes to extend China's concept of "community with a shared future for
mankind" to the Arctic region.]{.underline} Secondly, China will keep
its promises when it deals with Nordic states. Keeping promises is one
of China's important Arctic values. Keeping promises matters for China's
international reputation and soft power, as the U.S. has more advantages
over China in competition with the Nordic countries through its strong
military, economic influence and shared values related to political and
economic culture with the Nordic states. Therefore, keeping promises is
highly important for China as a new entrant that wants to carry out
practical cooperation with the Nordic countries. China can't afford the
price of breaking its words in the China-Nordic relations. As a newcomer
to the Arctic, China looks forward to constructing a positive
international image and making progress to win the trust of the Nordic
countries. Examining world history and contemporary international
politics, it is clear that the U.S. is less committed to keeping its
promises than China, and that the U.S. does not care about weaker
nations. On the other hand, the Chinese Confucian culture advocates
"words must be kept and deeds must be done", that is, to speak with
credit and to do things with results. Keeping promises is deeply rooted
in Chinese culture. Unlike the utilitarian and capitalist national
values of the United States, the Chinese cultural tradition of not
making promises lightly and striving to deliver on promises has helped
China to bring more predictable benefits to the Nordic countries in
cooperation. [In short, win-win cooperation and keeping promises are the
principles that China will adhere to in its competition with the U.S. in
the Nordic region.]{.underline} The significance of China's Arctic
policy for the Nordic countries The strengthening of economic, trade and
cultural exchanges between China and the Nordic countries not only
greatly benefits the economic and social development of the Nordic
countries, but more importantly provides the Nordic countries with more
options, gives the Nordic countries more strategic leverage and greatly
enhances the position of the small Nordic countries in the international
arena. Beneficial to the economic development of Nordic countries Given
the complementary economic structures between the Nordic countries and
China, the Nordic countries keep increasing demand for infrastructure, a
larger market for their resources and high-tech manufacturing. In recent
years, bilateral economic and trade relations between China and the
Nordic countries have grown steadily, with China being the largest
trading partner of the five Nordic countries in Asia. Chinese
investments to the Nordic countries increase year by year.5) China's
participation in Arctic development and construction brings capital,
technology and infrastructure to the Nordic countries, giving the Nordic
people tangible and predictable benefits. Throw out a minnow to catch a
whale The strengthening of China-Nordic countries' economic ties will
certainly drive U.S. attention and investment in the Arctic. After the
Cold War, the Arctic region was marginalized because the U.S. focused
mainly on Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific region,
and did not put much attention to the Arctic. China's increasing
investment in the Arctic compels the U.S. to re-focus on the Arctic.
U.S. Arctic investment is motivated mainly by the need for strategic
competition with China and Russia. Since 2021, the contents related to
the Arctic in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) issued by
the U.S. have increased year by year, and China's investment in the
Arctic causes anxiety and the U.S. is evaluating China's Arctic
investment. The latest United States' National Strategy for the Arctic
Region released in October 2022 expresses that the U.S. will strengthen
investment in Arctic infrastructure, protect indigenous peoples, and
develop emerging economies.6) It is predictable that the Nordic
countries can not only gain economic benefits from China's Arctic
involvement, but also gain increased attention from the U.S. due to
competition with China in the Arctic. That is to say, the Nordic
countries can maximize their economic benefits by profiting from power
competition, thus realizing the big diplomacy of small countries. This
U.S. strategic realignment has already created opportunities to get more
with less cost, and raise their profile on the international arena. The
Marshall Islands, located between Hawaii and Australia, recently signed
an agreement with the U.S. in which the U.S. committed \$700 million in
new support for the country over four years. "It's because of China. We
are not naive," admitted Marshall Islands Foreign Minister Kirtland
Kabua. China is pouring a lot of money and attention into many Pacific
islands nations with an effort to expand its influence and gain
economic, diplomatic and military benefits in the Pacific, which forces
the U.S. to follow and make adjustments.7) A similar performance has
shown in Nordic countries, where the United States directed Denmark to
invest in Greenland's airport construction in 2018 in order to beat
China in a bid to build Greenland's airport. China Communication
Construction was pushed out of three airport construction projects due
to U.S. pressure.8) Kalaallit Airports, the state-owned company of
Denmark, received the rights to renovate, own and operate Greenland
airports at a 33% stake. Copenhagen offers concessionary loans at a rate
of 1%. Moreover, the Pentagon promised "potential" investment in
Greenland infrastructure in the future. Thanks to the competition
between U.S. and China, Greenland will have new and renovated airports
at a lower price. However, this is almost impossible without Chinese
involvement. To compete for the Nordic countries, future investments by
the U.S. in the Arctic are expected to increase and bring practical
benefits to the Nordic people. The United States' Choice The U.S. has no
ability to oblige the Nordic countries to disengage with China Expelling
Chinese power from the Arctic and preventing China from gaining a
foothold in the Nordic region is one of the goals of U.S. Arctic
strategy. In recent years, the U.S. has strengthened its control over
the Nordic countries through military and intelligence cooperation,
constantly forced the Nordic countries to disengage from China and
attempted to exclude China from the Nordic region while controlling the
Nordic countries at the same time. But the complementary economic
structures between the Nordic countries and China as well as the
attractiveness of Chinese funding and infrastructure technology makes
disengagement impractical. The Nordic countries will lose diplomatic
autonomy if they blindly follow the US instruction. They will miss the
opportunity to ride the Chinese development train. Globally, it has been
the goal of U.S. policymakers to push the U.S. and its allies to
disengage with China in the areas of economic trade, technology, and
education. This aim replicates the Cold War era when they ganged up and
disintegrated the Soviet Union. Some experts call it the "New Cold War."
Such theorists argue that China will collapse if it is excluded from the
current international system and prevented from benefiting from the
world trading system and technological development -- as what happened
with the Soviet Union. However, policymakers holding this assumption do
not realize the difference between today's China and the Soviet Union of
the Cold War era. China manufactures large amounts of industrial goods
for the world every day, and has the largest and most comprehensive
industrial system in the world. Even the United States is not yet able
to decouple from China. Despite escalating national security tensions,
trade between the United States and China hit a record high in 2022,
with the bilateral goods trade between the countries rising to \$690.6
billion, according to official U.S. data, topping the previous record of
\$658.8 billion in 2018. Exports to China increased by \$2.4 billion to
\$153.8 billion, while imports of Chinese products rose by \$31.8
billion to \$536.8 billion, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis.9) The U.S. sanctions against China inevitably lead to damage
to its allies' economic systems. In President Joe Biden's 2023 State of
the Union address, the U.S. leader announced that it wants to begin a
trade embargo against allies: "Tonight, I'm announcing new standards
that all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects
must be made in the United States. America-made lumber, glass, gypsum
board and fiber optic cable. American roads, American bridges and
American highways will be made with American products." U.S. alliance
policy is filled with a plethora of inherent contradictions, such as
targeting the embargo on products made by allies -- harming the
interests of allies. Will the U.S. policy succeed in defending "Made in
America" and excluding Chinese and U.S. ally products? History and facts
have proved its failure. As long as China insists on "equality and
mutual benefit" and continues to strengthen the trade ties with the
world, and if the U.S. allies can benefit from trade with China, the
policy of containing and isolating China is doomed to failure. Britain,
France, West Germany, Japan and Canada traded with the Soviet Union
despite the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. There is a similar
situation with China today. At the request of Russia, the UN Security
Council held a public meeting on February 21, 2023 for the Nord Stream
gas pipeline explosion of last September. The convening nations
discussed launching an international investigation of the Nord Stream II
explosion. The results of the investigation may continue to tear apart
the US-led Atlantic alliance system. Because the U.S. shares more of the
same political-economic values as the Nordic countries, China has never
expected the Nordic countries to side with China, nor expected the
Nordic countries to betray the United States. What China plans to do is
to ignite Nordic countries' ideals for higher standards of living, to
awaken their inspiration for national dignity and their dream for
independent policy making. Nobody can stop people's aspiration for a
better life once it is ignited. The elites and populations of the Nordic
countries have the natural right to pursue higher levels of economic
development, higher-level industrial structures and more autonomous
national strategies. If the U.S. attempts to forcefully separate these
countries from China, including commercial and academic exchanges
between both sides, it may instead stimulate greater interest in their
exchanges with China and raise the cost of U.S. control over its allies,
since it is impossible to cut off the Nordic countries from China in the
information age. The United States is like a "mega corporation"
consisting of many shareholders and groups, including the
military-industrial complex and international energy groups. Every
interest group can use the U.S. as a large corporation to pursue its own
interests. Competition with China is bound to intensify domestic
disputes and even conflicts within the U.S. The struggle between U.S.
domestic interest groups also provides an opportunity for the Nordic
countries to achieve their strategic autonomy. The U.S. Nordic policy
will eventually bite back at itself The U.S. is a capitalist country,
and the principle of confrontation with China in the Nordic region is
subject to hegemonic and economic interests. The costs of competing with
China in the Nordic region have to be calculated and balanced.
Confrontation with China can only be profitable and sustainable if the
benefits outweigh the costs. Once the costs are higher than the
benefits, it will be difficult for the U.S. to sustain the competition.
The profit-seeking properties of capital dictates a strong internal
countervailing force which will make the U.S. tired of dealing with it.
According to the analyses of Hillary Clinton, China has the advantage of
a more powerful political system than the United States, which controls
fewer national resources than China. "We'll never beat China unless 'we
take back the means of production.'"10) China can utilize more resources
and compete with the U.S. at any cost, but the U.S. political system
cannot do so. Due to the political system advantages, China will be the
last winner in the Nordic competing with the U.S. According to Chinese
Taoism, "Reversion is the action of Tao（反者道之动)", which means that
things may develop in the opposite direction of the will, and that
strengths and weaknesses can be transformed into each other. U[.S.
Arctic policy is falling into the trap of]{.underline} "Reversion is the
action of Tao" by [aggravating friends, helping adversaries, and hurting
itself.]{.underline} The result of oppressing allies and sacrificing
their interests blindly is to push them toward China. [The U.S. is
falling into a trap and vicious cycle. The greater the effort to boycott
China, the greater the price it has to pay and the greater the loss it
will suffer. Any miscalculation will push the U.S.' allies toward China,
which adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and win-win. The
disastrous effects of U.S. policy are not visible now, but they will be
in the future]{.underline}. The Nordic countries could maintain and
increase cooperation with the U.S. rationally, while strengthening their
ties with China which adhere to win-win cooperation and keeping its
promises, and obtain practical benefits and national dignity in the face
of power competition. [For the United States, the only way out is
to]{.underline} either give up the vicious competition with China or
[cooperate with China to maintain peace and prosperity in the North
Atlantic and Arctic.]{.underline} Conclusion The competition between the
major powers in the Arctic has brought pressure and crisis to the Nordic
countries, but at the same time it has also brought opportunities. As
long as the Nordic countries attach importance to their own national
interests and catch the opportunities, they will benefit more from the
power competition, gain more international influence and practical
benefits that greatly exceed the size of their own territory and
strength, and contribute to the promotion of peace in the Arctic.

### 2AC -- Disease Add-On

Science fiction is rife with fanciful tales of deadly organisms emerging
from the ice and wreaking havoc on unsuspecting human victims.

From shape-shifting aliens in Antarctica, to super-parasites emerging
from a thawing woolly mammoth in Siberia, to exposed permafrost in
Greenland causing a viral pandemic -- the concept is marvellous plot
fodder.

But just how far-fetched is it? [[Could
**pathogens**]{.underline}]{.mark} that were once common on Earth -- but
[**[frozen]{.mark}** for millennia [in]{.mark} glaciers, ice caps and
**[permafrost]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [**[emerge]{.mark}** from the
melting ice to **lay waste** to modern ecosystems? [The potential
is]{.mark}, in fact, **[quite real]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Dangers lying in wait

In 2003, bacteria were revived from samples taken from the bottom of an
ice core drilled into an ice cap on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. The ice
at that depth was more than 750,000 years old.

In 2014, a giant "zombie" Pithovirus sibericum virus was revived from
30,000-year-old Siberian permafrost.

And in 2016, [an [outbreak of **anthrax**]{.mark}]{.underline} (a
disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis) [in western Siberia
[was attributed to]{.mark} the **[rapid thawing]{.mark}** of B.
anthracis spores [in **permafrost**]{.mark}. It killed
**thousands**]{.underline} of reindeer and affected dozens of people.

More recently, [scientists found remarkable genetic **compatibility**
between **viruses**]{.underline} isolated from lake sediments [in the
high Arctic and potential living **hosts**.]{.underline}

[Earth's climate is **warming** at a spectacular rate, and up to **four
times** faster in]{.underline} colder regions such as [the
**Arctic**]{.underline}. Estimates suggest [we can expect four
**sextillion**]{.underline} (4,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)
[microorganisms to be **released** from ice melt **each
year**]{.underline}. This is about the same as the estimated number of
stars in the universe.

However, despite the unfathomably large number of microorganisms being
released from melting ice (including pathogens that can potentially
infect modern species), [no one has been able to **estimate** the
**risk** this poses to modern **ecosystems**.]{.underline}

[In [a new **study**]{.mark}]{.underline} published today in the journal
PLOS Computational Biology, [we [calculated the]{.mark} ecological
[**risks** posed by]{.mark} the release of]{.underline} unpredictable
[**[ancient viruses]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Our simulations show that [1% of simulated releases of [just **one**
dormant **pathogen** could cause **major**]{.mark} environmental
[**damage** and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [widespread
**[loss]{.mark}**]{.underline} of host organisms around the world.

Digital worlds

We used a software called Avida to run experiments that simulated the
release of one type of ancient pathogen into modern biological
communities.

We then measured the impacts of this invading pathogen on the diversity
of modern host bacteria in thousands of simulations, and compared these
to simulations where no invasion occurred.

The invading pathogens often survived and evolved in the simulated
modern world. About 3% of the time the pathogen became dominant in the
new environment, in which case they were very likely to cause losses to
modern host diversity.

[In the **worst**- (but still entirely **plausible**) case **scenario**,
the [invasion **reduced** the]{.mark} **size** of its [host community by
**30%**]{.mark}]{.underline} when compared to controls.

The risk from this small fraction of pathogens might seem small, but
keep in mind [[these are]{.mark} the [results of releasing **just
one**]{.mark} particular [pathogen]{.mark} in simulated environments.
[With the **sheer number**]{.mark} of ancient **microbes** being
released [in the real world]{.mark}]{.underline}, such [[**outbreaks**
represent]{.mark} a [**substantial danger**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Extinction and disease

Our findings suggest [this **unpredictable threat**]{.underline} which
has so far been confined to science fiction [could become a **powerful**
driver of ecological **change**.]{.underline}

While we didn't model the potential risk to humans, [the fact that
"time-travelling" **pathogens** could become established and **severely
degrade** a host community is already **worrisome**.]{.underline}

We highlight yet [another [source of potential **species
extinction**]{.mark} in the modern era]{.underline} -- one which even
our worst-case extinction models do not include. As a society, we need
to understand the potential risks so we can prepare for them.

Notable viruses such as [SARS-CoV-2, Ebola and HIV were likely
**transmitted** to humans via contact with other **animal
hosts**]{.underline}. So it is plausible that [a [once **ice-bound**
virus could enter]{.mark} the [**human** population via]{.mark} a
[**zoonotic** pathway]{.mark}.]{.underline}

While the likelihood of a pathogen emerging from melting ice and causing
catastrophic extinctions is low, our results show [[this is **no
longer** a **fantasy**]{.mark} for which we shouldn't
prepare.]{.underline}

What Lies Beneath

Permafrost is ground that remains frozen at 0°C for two or more
consecutive years; an active layer at the surface thaws in the summer
and refreezes in the winter.15 Depending on local conditions, the active
layer may extend from a few centimeters to a meter or more down from the
surface. Permafrost thaw may be gradual, effectively thickening the
active layer, or abrupt, such as when riverbanks or coastlines erode and
expose previously buried ground.16 Although some permafrost can be found
in South America and Antarctica, most occurs in the northern
hemisphere.17 [Just as the ocean acts as a **carbon sink**, [permafrost
serves as a **reservoir of mercury**]{.mark}---[the **largest**]{.mark}
such reservoir [on the **planet**]{.mark}.]{.underline}18 Adding to the
products of natural decomposition, prevailing atmospheric currents and
local winds transport mercury, released by fires and smokestacks across
the globe, to the Arctic.19 There, the mercury settles to the ground and
is encased in permafrost,20 where microbial activity is held in
stasis.17 [[Thawing may **release**]{.mark} inorganic [mercury
into]{.mark} salt- or fresh**[water]{.mark}**, where microbial activity
and chemical reactions convert it to
**methylmercury**]{.underline}21[---the form **most toxic** to
humans]{.underline}22---[[which]{.mark} then [enters the **food
web**]{.mark}]{.underline}.23

[[Other]{.mark} common [pollutants]{.mark}]{.underline} at active
industrial and contaminated [sites [include **lead**,
**arsenic**]{.mark}, PCBs, [and **pesticides**]{.mark}]{.underline}.7
[[As permafrost **thaws**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the soil slumps and the
legs of holding tanks can crumple, reservoirs holding back liquid waste
become compromised, and building foundations crack. [Gullies and
[**streams** develop, **mobilizing** contaminants]{.mark}7 and
complicating overland travel]{.underline}.24 A recent study estimated
that [[a **quarter** of **contaminated sites**]{.mark} in the Arctic
[will **thaw**]{.mark} by the end of the century]{.underline},7
[releasing their contaminants]{.underline} into the air and water and,
thus, [into the **food web**]{.underline}.25,26

In a project to document the extent of polluted and polluting sites,
Moritz Langer and his collaborators estimated that [potentially
[**hazardous** substances are stored]{.mark} or actively handled [in
**permafrost**]{.mark} zones [at **4,500 sites**]{.mark} across the
globe]{.underline}.7 Langer is an associate professor at Vrije
Universiteit in the Netherlands and a researcher at Germany's Alfred
Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research.
Analyzing global data sets---including OpenStreetMap and the Atlas of
Population, Society, and Economy in the Arctic---as well as regional
data from Alaska's Contaminated Sites Program and Canada's Federal
Contaminated Sites Inventory, Langer\'s team extrapolated that across
the Arctic region, 13,000--20,000 contaminated sites are associated with
those industrial locations. Most (approximately 70%) are located in
Russia, with about 18% in the United States and Canada, and the
remainder in Greenland and Norway's Svalbard archipelago.7

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

"The major problem we encountered in our study is that data and detailed
information on what is where, in what quantity, and in what condition
are largely unavailable," Langer says, noting the pressing need for
international policy collaboration. "Because Arctic countries have very
different environmental legislation and data policies, there is no
single database, and in some cases the data are not publicly available
at all. This is the reason we had to limit our analysis to a first
estimate." As with locations of contaminated sites, Langer and his team
say documentation is needed to measure types, quantity, and toxicity of
industrial substances; their potential to leach and contaminate water;
their proximity to streams, creeks, rivers, and rising water tables; and
their storage or disposal conditions. Early warning systems would alert
communities to sites in danger of becoming compromised by permafrost
subsidence, he says. Ongoing remote sensing and modeling would establish
a baseline from which to measure changing conditions. "With the data we
currently have, we cannot conduct a thorough risk analysis, either for
specific regions and communities or for the entire Arctic," Langer says.
"An international agreement to document the transport, use, and fate of
chemicals in the Arctic would give us much better insight, which we
urgently need to plan mitigation and remediation measures." Academic
researchers, nongovernmental organizations, local Indigenous activists,
and other groups around the world are turning their attention to the
issue of thawing permafrost and contaminant release: - Federal agencies
of the US government, including the National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences, the US Environmental Protection Agency, and the
National Science Foundation - Natural Resources Canada - The Arctic
Council (an intergovernmental forum of Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States) and its
subgroup, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme - Arctic
PASSION (Pan-Arctic Observing System of Systems: Implementing
Observations for Societal Needs), a European Union--funded network of
collaborators using data and both on-the-ground and remote observations
to inform Arctic policy - Nunataryuk,27 a 12-nation collaborative
permafrost research project funded by the EU Horizon 2020 Framework
Programme For some communities, the fledgling and time-intensive process
required for nations to develop a joint strategy to address contaminant
documentation and exposure may be too little, too late. Alaskan towns
such as Niugtaq and Napakiak are staring the existential threat of
thawing permafrost in the face. In late 2022, the Biden Administration
committed \$⁢50 million in funds to begin relocating their residents
ahead of flooding and building collapse.28 This need to move villages
has overshadowed other issues in Arctic communities, says Langer. "In my
opinion, the issue of contamination should receive more attention \[than
it has\]. There is a real threat to water resources and fishing
grounds," he says, acknowledging as well the very immediate threat to
buildings from thawing permafrost. "The mobilization of contaminants
combined with the general threat of infrastructure destabilization are
factors that could exacerbate the problem of community relocation."
Compounding Problems Unfortunately, the double-barreled threat to Arctic
peoples of thawing permafrost and exposed contaminants does not exist in
isolation.29 Traditional foods30 and the availability and quality of
drinking water31 in these far-northern communities are threatened.
Climate warming accelerates the mobilization of chemicals and
microplastics that are sequestered in sea ice and glaciers, in addition
to those in permafrost.32,33 Arctic ice is diminishing,34 sea levels are
rising,35 and more intense storms can create greater storm surges than
usual.36 Health threats from contaminated soils and water are
intensified by compromised dwellings and infrastructure.37 "My
experience in listening to elders in the communities that we work with
is that permafrost thawing is having a profound effect, not only causing
subsidence and erosion of homes and infrastructure but also affecting
and limiting access to traditional food and water sources and travel for
hunting and fishing," says Pamela Miller, executive director of Alaska
Community Action on Toxics (ACAT), a nongovernmental organization that
works closely with Alaskan Indigenous communities. For example, thaw
interferes with travel over previously frozen land,23 and changes in
migration patterns and populations of such traditional food sources as
caribou and whales mean harvest levels are declining in some areas.38 Of
the Alaskan sites identified by Langer's study, more than 60% are
associated with industrial or military activity; spilled fuels make up
about half the pollutants found at these locations.7 (The remainder of
the sites were associated with such varied activities as seafood
processing, dry cleaners, railroads, illicit drug labs, and more.39) One
site identified in Langer's study is a former US Air Force base at
Northeast Cape on Sivuqaq (St. Lawrence Island) in the Bering Sea, mere
miles from Russia's Chukchi Peninsula.40 Sea birds soar above the
island's cliffs, which are dotted with their nests.41 Whales and seals
ply the cold, dark waters.42 A landscape of rugged beauty, Sivuqaq for
millennia provided the sustenance its residents need to
live---sustenance with contaminant levels that now threaten the health
of its residents.43,44 Traditional foods, such as seabird eggs, fish,
walrus, and polar bear, have elevated levels of PCBs, mercury, and other
bioaccumulated contaminants.43,45 Following the abandonment of the
military base at the end of the Cold War, its waste---including PFAS,
PCBs, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers---was left aboveground. Those
chemicals are leaching into soil and water and migrating into the food
web.46 A 2005 study found that the residents of Sivuqaq had blood levels
of PCBs five to eight times higher than the general US population,
although the proportion attributable to the military base was not
clear.42 However, a 2022 health consultation from the US Agency on Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry found "little evidence" that
environmental exposures associated with Northeast Cape sites are
contributing to cancer or birth defect rates.47 Arja Rautio, who leads
the Arctic Health research group at the University of Oulu in Finland,
is a toxicologist by training. She also leads the Health and Pollution
Work Package within the Nunataryuk research project.26 Rautio's group
has published findings on temporal trends of contaminants in Arctic
populations48 and, more specifically, on pregnant women's blood levels
of pesticides---including organochlorine compounds---and metals; such
contaminants are emitted by agricultural and industrial operations
elsewhere and transported atmospherically.49 Rautio notes that the
health effects of exposure to contaminants go beyond ailments of the
body; the mental health of people whose towns are becoming uninhabitable
is also of concern. On top of physical changes to the landscape and
risks posed by contaminated food and water, the knowledge that one's
community may soon cease to exist takes an emotional toll, she says.
"Health effects are a large spectrum of different types of outcomes in
humans, and many of those need a long time to develop," Rautio says.
"When we are talking about human health, we need to include health as a
whole---mental, spiritual, physical, and social health together---and
contaminants are one part of that." "Many things in our lives may
challenge our mental health, such as problems related to economic,
social, environmental---infrastructure and nature---and cultural
issues," says Ulla Timlin, a postdoctoral researcher at the University
of Oulu, who has studied these issues in the context of Arctic
communities.50,51 "Therefore, it is very important to investigate this
area, to understand how climate change and permafrost thaw affect
people's perceived mental wellness and well-being, and which factors may
be connected to it when living in a changing environment." She says it
is essential to gather information from both non-Indigenous and
Indigenous perspectives in the Arctic. "We are overwhelmed with concern
about the health harms associated with climate change---the loss of sea
ice, melting permafrost, and the mobilization of chemicals and
plastics," wrote Delbert Pungowiyi, president of the Native Village of
Savoonga, on Sivuqaq, in a September 2019 editorial published in the
Anchorage Daily News.52 "We are running out of time!" Searching for
Solutions Traditional knowledge and the latest scientific findings will
both be necessary in the new reality Arctic communities are learning to
navigate.53 In the face of climate anxiety,54 Timlin says empowerment to
face changes related to thawing permafrost is enormously important to
Indigenous peoples' well-being and satisfaction with life, as is
continuing to practice traditional ways of life, such as observing
ceremonies and, to the extent possible, eating traditional foods.2 "The
most important step is \[for communities and governments\] to discuss,
listen, and talk about the possible future situation in environment,
wildlife, water, and food security," Rautio says. Research gaps also
must be addressed. For example, a 2020 scoping review of research at the
intersection of climate, water, and health found no studies (up to 2018)
that projected future climate change impacts on drinking water in the
Arctic.55 Rautio underscores the importance of community input in
solving coming challenges, such as developing methods to provide clean
drinking water to settlements threatened by its loss. "Citizen science
is an important element of future research," she says. "Together with
researchers, communities can find solutions." In Alaska, ACAT is working
closely with the people of Sivuqaq to help community members study
sources of contamination, engage in environmental activism, and
influence state and national policy changes rather than waiting for help
to arrive from elsewhere. Indeed, the continued existence of communities
and their traditional ways of life on Sivuqaq may depend on their
empowerment. "Our community-based research56 focuses on measuring
contaminant levels and health indicators in children through a project
called Protecting the Health of Future Generations," Miller says.
"Another project aims to characterize the nature and extent of
contaminant levels in the environment and people---and health
outcomes---associated with the former military base at Northeast Cape on
Sivuqaq."

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Miller says ACAT works at the international level on chemical treaties,
such as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (the
only global legally binding treaty targeting chemicals that
disproportionately endanger the Arctic) and the Minamata Convention on
Mercury. In addition, the organization urges limiting the production and
use of harmful chemicals and addressing the full life cycle of
plastics,57 because ceasing to contribute to the source of a problem is
a first step toward solving it. Miller says her team does not currently
have the means to measure releases of contaminants from permafrost, but
"[we know [it is a **large problem** that must be **addressed** through
**urgent action** on climate. **Chemicals**]{.mark}]{.underline},
plastics, [[and **climate** must be]{.mark} \[recognized\] and urgently
[addressed as **interconnected**]{.mark} and **[existential
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

Echoing statements by Langer and Miller, Rautio notes that establishing
basic monitoring is a great place to start. "[[Pollutants **don't
recognize borders**]{.underline}]{.mark}," she says, "especially
[[when]{.mark} they are re-[**evaporated** from]{.mark} thawing
**[permafrost]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

1\. Introduction

Despite recent social protests and climate emergency declarations,
[[efforts to **mitigate**]{.mark} climate change to date [are
**insufficient**]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 Greenhouse gas
(**[[GHG]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[emissions]{.mark} continue to
**[rise]{.mark}** and global [**warming** above **3
°**]{.mark}**C**]{.underline} is increasingly likely this century.2
[There is emerging evidence of **amplifying** [feedbacks
**accelerating**]{.mark}**3**]{.underline} [and **dampening** feedbacks
**decelerating**]{.underline}.4 [These]{.underline} feedbacks
[**[exacerbate]{.mark}** the possibility of **[runaway]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}**]{.underline},5 estimated [at **8 °C**]{.underline} or
greater by 2100.6 Such temperature increases translate to a range of
real dangers,7 shifting the narrow climate niche within which humans
have resided for millennia.8

Looking beyond the framing of "global warming", there is concern that
[the [**effects** of climate change]{.mark} may pose an **existential
risk** to humanity]{.underline}, one [that
**[threaten]{.mark}**]{.underline}s ["**societal collapse**" or even
**[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.9 Understanding these worst-case
scenarios is essential for good risk management.10 Improving awareness
of potential pathways through which climate change poses such a risk can
help inform decision- making about interventions.11 Considering societal
impacts that are more tangible for individuals, businesses and
governments,12 and better aligned with conventional risk priorities,13
may facilitate more effective action to mitigate climate change.14

A number of pathways through which climate change could cause societal
collapse have been identified, one being via food insecurity.15 [Climate
change is predicted to [undermine **ag**]{.mark}ricultural systems
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} disrupt [[**food**
supply]{.underline}]{.mark},16 [[which]{.mark} may [lead to **economic**
shocks]{.mark}, socio- political **[instability]{.mark}** as well as
**starvation**, [**migration** and **conflict** at]{.mark}]{.underline}
local through to [[**global** scale]{.underline}]{.mark}.17 [While the

In this chapter we aim to identify and structure an empirical evidence
base of the relationships between climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse. We do this using Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD), a system
dynamics approach that is useful for visualising the relationships
between variables in a complex system.21 This chapter is organised as
follows. In Section 2, we review the societal collapse and existential
risk literature to refine the aim introduced above. In Section 3, we
develop an original methodology to establish a new empirical evidence
base and create a novel-format CLD of causal pathways between climate
change and societal collapse. In Section 4, we present and discuss the
results from the application of this methodology to the climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway of interest. We
conclude, in Section 5, by identifying avenues of future work that may
build upon this chapter. 2. Literature Review To refine the aim of this
chapter, introduced in Section 1, our review examines whether there is
historical evidence of climate change as a mechanism of societal
collapse and to what extent have causal pathways been documented to
inform our understanding of climate change as an existential threat to
contemporary society. We first define the terms " existential risk" and
"societal collapse" as used in this chapter. Adopting Ord's definition,
"an existential risk is a risk that threatens the destruction of
humanity's long-term potential" be it incomplete destruction, such as
societal collapse, or complete destruction, such as extinction.22
Adopting Kemp's definition, societal collapse is an "enduring loss of
population, identity \[and/or institutional\] complexity";23 it may be
abrupt or gradual, but is typically rapid because it is notably
transformative, and may be experienced by a local, national or the
global community of people. Fig. 1 presents a conceptual model of
societal collapse, synthesised from the broader literature, to provide
further contextual definition. \[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\] The rise and fall of
civilisations has been documented since the earliest recordings of
history and is increasingly studied to inform our understanding of
societal collapse.24 We consider two types of historical studies that
provide insight into climate change as a mechanism of societal collapse
in the past. We note that other mechanisms are also discussed in the
literature, and there is debate about the role of different mechanisms
in particular societal collapse events. The first type of historical
study empirically investigates an individual societal collapse event
using primary sources, including anthropological, archaeological and
paleontological data. Based on such data analysis, natural climate
change has been asserted as a mechanism of societal collapse in many of
these case studies, as established by de Menocal25 and Weiss and
Bradley.26 For example, Hodell et al.,27 Haug et al.,28 and
Medina-Elizalde and Rohling29 analyse paleoclimate data alongside the
archaeological record to show that drought conditions, driven by climate
change likely due to solar forcing, contributed to the collapse of the
Classic Maya civilisation of Mesoamerica in \~8--10th century CE. Weiss
et al.,30 Cullen et al.,31 and Cookson et al.32 show that regional
aridity, driven by climate change likely due to volcanic forcing,
contributed to the collapse of multiple societies across Mesopotamia,
including the Akkadian Empire in \~22nd century BCE. Similarly, natural
climate change has been implicated in the collapse of multiple Late
Bronze Age societies around the Mediterranean,33 including Mycenaean
Kingdoms in \~12th century BCE,34 the Harappan Civilization of South
Asia in \~19th century BCE,35 the Angkor Empire of Southeast Asia in
\~15th century CE,36 multiple Chinese Dynasties37 and civilisations
along the Silk Road38 during the previous millennium, the Norse Vikings
of Greenland in \~16th century AD,39 and the Tiwanaku Empire of Pre-
Columbian South America in \~10th century CE40 amongst others. This
first type of studies establishes precedence of natural climate change
as a mechanism of societal collapse throughout history, demonstrating
the risk that anthropogenic climate change similarly poses to
contemporary society. However, the events examined occurred more than
100 years ago, with most dating back to ancient history, when societies
were relatively isolated. Because these case studies pre- date
contemporary society, they do not provide empirical evidence of
anthropogenic climate change in context of today's highly interconnected
society.41 Statistical evaluation of the frequency and significance of
natural climate change relative to other mechanisms of societal collapse
identified across these case studies has not yet been established within
the literature. However, the second type of historical study does
qualitatively examine collections of these case studies to develop
theories of predominant modes of societal collapse. Three major modes
are observed, as follows. Fagan42 and McMichael43 focus on natural
impact on the human system across multiple civilisations, concluding
that natural climate change is predominant having significantly
influenced human existence throughout history. Over the past 12,000
years, the natural and human systems developed within the stable climate
niche of the Holocene Epoch.44 The associated geographic endowments
governed human transition from band societies based on foraging to
complex societies based on agriculture. Unfavourable subtle (e.g.
weather variations) and drastic (e.g. natural disasters) shifts in
climate influenced the collapse of complex societies either by direct
loss of life or indirectly via resource insecurity. In particular, in
this mode, typically, the loss of agriculture led to de- population via
famine, migration or conflict due to food insecurity. Ponting,45
Wright,46 and Diamond47 focus on human impact on the natural system
across multiple civilisations, concluding that human overpopulation and
overexploitation relative to the carrying capacity of the environment is
predominant. Societal collapse via environmental degradation often
involved unsustainable agriculture, exacerbated by natural climate
change, leading to de- population as well as institutional breakdown via
loss of economic stability and socio-political dysfunction due to
magnified inequality. This mode aligns with early "Malthusian
catastrophe",48 "tragedy of the commons",49 and "overshoot-and-
collapse"50 theories. In their 12-volume magnum opus exploring the rise
and fall of 28 civilizations, Toynbee concludes that "great
civilizations are not murdered \[but rather\] they take their own
lives."51 Building on this, Tainter,52 Acemoglu and Robinson,53 and
Johnson54 focus on human impact on the human system across multiple
civilisations, concluding that societal complexity in relation to
problem-solving inability (e.g. environmental degradation) and
institutional dysfunction (e.g. inequality and oligarchy internally,
trade ally and hostile neighbour relations externally) is predominant.
As a society becomes more complex, it reaches a point beyond which
"continued investment in complexity as a problem-solving strategy yields
a declining marginal return" and it will be at risk of collapsing under
its own weight via institutional breakdown and de- population.55 This
mode aligns with "energy returned on energy invested" theory,56 applied
to explore societal collapse by Homer-Dixon.57 Diamond,58 Turchin,59 and
Schwartz and Nichols60 examine why some civilisations have been able to
thrive or recover, rather than collapse. They similarly conclude that
societies have flourished due to combinations of favourable geographic
endowment, managing their existence within the carrying capacity of the
natural system, and co-operative action in problem-solving. This second
type of studies highlights that societal collapse involves a complex
nexus of factors and dynamically interlinked events. For instance,
Gibbon details how all three of the modes, described in the preceding
five paragraphs, contributed to the collapse of the Roman Empire.61
These modes of societal collapse, although based on empirical evidence
pre-dating contemporary society, describe key aspects of the
anthropogenic climate change problem faced today. While these studies
describe causal pathways of relevance, to the best of our knowledge, no
study has used CLDs to untangle the complexity and give structure to the
dense information in this evidence base. Across these historical
studies, we observe no apparent temporal or spatial influence on the
occurrence of societal collapse. Rather, societal collapse has been
described as occurring in various forms, whether it be by known
"white-swan" or surprise "black swan" events,62 in different geographic
locations and times throughout history. Additionally, a quantitative
statistical analysis by Arbesman shows that societal collapse has
occurred randomly and independent of civilisation life- spans.63 These
qualitative and quantitative observations highlight that any society may
be susceptible to collapse, much in-line with the Red Queen Hypothesis
of the Law of Extinction. From these historical studies, we observe sets
of secondary determinants for each of the primary determinants
introduced in Fig. 1, which are defined in Fig. 2. Considering a
geographically bounded society, emigration refers to any permanent
departure of population including both voluntary or forced migration,
conflict mortality accounts for deaths directly arising from any form of
domestic or international conflict (e.g. due to war), and natural
mortality accounts for deaths related to domestic environmental
conditions (e.g. due to famine). The loss of socio-cultural norms,
political structures or economic value accounts for that which notably
transforms the identity and institutions of the society. \[FIGURE 2
OMITTED\] In addition to these historical studies, we consider the
relatively nascent studies of existential risks (X-risks) that provide
insight into how climate change may trigger societal collapse in the
future.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Comprehensive surveys of X-risks reveal mechanisms that could cause the
collapse of contemporary society. Bostrom and Ćirković,65 Rees,66 and
Ord67 provide eminent scholarly treatment of the field, drawing from the
academic literature. The World Economic Forum68 and Global Challenges
Foundation69 produce global risk reports drawing from decision-makers
and experts across intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations.
These surveys establish that [many **historically observed** mechanisms

**applicable** as X-risks **today**]{.underline}. However, [the
**state** of existence of **contemporary** society]{.underline} has [led
to a **different landscape**]{.underline} in which these mechanisms
apply, and to a number of unprecedented mechanisms, including
anthropogenic climate change. Ehrlich and Ehrlich70 and Häggström71 note
that [although [increased **complexity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as
globalisation and technological advancement[, can **increase** a

**[increase vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example,
globalisation increases resilience to local agricultural production
shocks through access to global markets; however, it also increases
vulnerability through exposure to sudden reversal in connectivity, such
as trade restrictions.72 Some [**geoengineering**

and adapt to climate change; however, they [may also increase
**vulnerability** to **termination shocks**, where

Works by Lynas,76 Wallace-Wells77 and Gowdy78 draw on the scientific
climate change literature to explore hypothetical futures under best- to
worst-case scenarios. The scenarios consider the feedbacks within the
natural system that could worsen, as well as the potential for humans to
mitigate, anthropogenic climate change. [Shifts in]{.underline} average
weather (e.g. **[temperature]{.underline}**) [and natural
**disasters**]{.underline} (e.g. floods) [affected by climate change

effects, [coupled with **sea level** rise]{.underline} due to melting of
ice caps, [could **indirectly** impact]{.underline} human [mortality via
**degradation** of the **natural world** system]{.underline} (e.g. land

**insecurity**]{.underline}. [This insecurity could impact institutional
**stability**, resulting in **economic** loss, political **dysfunction**
and]{.underline} social [**unrest**, as well as **migration** and
**conflict**]{.underline}. The hypothetical outcomes for contemporary
society against the threat of anthropogenic climate change range from
dystopian (collapse) to utopian (recovery).

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

These futures studies identify endpoints of different causal pathways
between anthropogenic climate change effects and potential impacts on
the human world system, with the latter reflecting key determinants of
societal collapse observed in the historical studies. Scholars have made
limited in-roads to empirically investigating the top-level
relationships between some of these endpoints using recent datasets. The
direct links between climate change and the endpoint impacts of
mortality, conflict and migration are, respectively, examined by Mora et
al.,79 Hsiang et al.80 and Hauer et al.81 The feedback between migration
and conflict driven by climate change is examined by Abel et al.82 The
direct links between climate change and the endpoint impacts of economic
loss, political instability and shifts in cultural norms are examined by
Burke et al.,83 Sofuoğlu and Ay,84 and Adger et al.85 respectively.
However, the complex bottom-level links between and surrounding these
endpoints are generally ill understood,86 and the strength of empirical
evidence is poorly documented from a systems science perspective.87 To
the best of our knowledge, no study has empirically examined how the
impacts of climate change could explicitly translate into societal
collapse for contemporary society. We do not have a clear picture of
climate change as a systemic risk to our globalised society,
particularly at spatial scales accounting for the heterogeneity of
individual identity, business governance and policymaking across
nations, and international exchanges. This limits our ability to
understand feedbacks, identify intervention points, develop quantitative
models and inform strategies to minimise the risk of societal collapse
occurring in the future.88 Given the insights from this review, we
refine the aim of this chapter as follows. Firstly, the empirical
evidence base should specifically address contemporary society.
Secondly, the CLD should be constructed at a scale and granularity that
addresses the heterogenous characteristics of nations and international
interactions. The refined aim of this chapter is thus to identify an
empirical evidence base of climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse in contemporary society and structure the evidence base with a
CLD defined at global scale and national granularity. 3. Methodology A
two-stage framework, consisting of five steps, was developed to achieve
the aim of this chapter. For each step, below, we first introduce it
generically and then describe its application to our specific analysis
of the climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse causal
pathway. 3.1. Stage 1: Establishing an empirical evidence base of
societal collapse in contemporary society Step I deploys societal
collapse proxies via a key word search to identify "evidence points",
which in this instance may be considered data points, in the form of
publications that empirically examine the causal pathway of interest in
contemporary society. The determinants defined in Fig. 2 provide these
societal collapse proxies to establish the new empirical evidence base
in lieu of historical societal collapse events pre-dating contemporary
society. The population loss set are straightforward to isolate,
consistent to measure across nations and describe tangible consequences.
The institutional breakdown set are relatively less so. Thus, the
societal collapse proxies adopted in this study were natural mortality
(i.e. starvation, with respect to food insecurity), conflict mortality
and emigration; subsequent studies could use the institutional breakdown
set. Key words were selected based on terminology of climate change,
food insecurity and the societal collapse proxies. Peer-reviewed journal
articles were chosen as the form of evidence point in this study;
subsequent studies could use other publications, such as books and
reports. The keyword search was performed in Scopus. A record of the
search is contained in the Supplementary Information (A.). Approximately
3,000 publications were reviewed by reading the title, abstract and main
body as needed. Evidence points were selected based on satisfaction of
the following criteria: the publication (a) is a peer-reviewed, English-
language, journal article; (b) uses empirical, data driven methods; (c)
examines the period from 1990 to present (2019), representative of
contemporary society; and (d) primarily examines the causal pathway of
interest. We made an exception to (a) to include the most recent Limits
to Growth book,89 which was not itself a search result but documents the
World3 model that was identified in the search results. We note that (b)
precluded selection of review or essay-style publications; however, we
found that these were often discussed in the literature review of
selected evidence points, so were, nonetheless, accounted for
indirectly. This step resulted in a new empirical evidence base
consisting of 41 evidence points, which are summarised in Fig. 4. Step
II defines a custom colour-coded typology for the new empirical evidence
base. This typology is used in Stage 2, to construct a final CLD (f-CLD)
in a novel format showing the spread of the evidence base across the
system. In this study, we were interested in the methodological spread
as this provides information on data that may be useful for future
studies. Four methodological categories were identified in the new
empirical evidence base. Each evidence point was classified into one of
these categories and assigned a colour coding, namely: quantitative
complex systems model --- red; statistical analysis of quantitative
dataset --- blue; collection / analysis of qualitative interview /
survey data --- green; quantitative data-led case study / scenario ---
yellow. The resulting typology of the new empirical evidence base is
shown in Fig. 4. 3.2. Stage 2: Constructing a novel-format causal loop
diagram from the empirical evidence base Step III involves creating an
individual CLD (i-CLD) for each evidence point to clearly structure the
complex causal relationships examined. These i-CLDs provide the building
blocks from which to construct the f-CLD in Step IV. \[FIGURE 3
REMOVED\] The process to create an i-CLD is as follows. The
corresponding evidence point was examined in its entirety to identify
and record key information in the form of variables (nodes), links
(arrowed lines) and relationship notation (positive or negative). Key
information derived from the original data-driven content, i.e. the main
analysis, of the evidence point was colour coded in the i-CLD according
to the typology classification established in Step II. Any relationships
hypothesised but not supported by the main analysis were coloured grey.
Key information derived from other content, i.e. the literature review,
of the evidence point was coloured black. The scale and granularity of
the i-CLD was recorded as detailed in the evidence point. This process
was repeated for each evidence point in isolation until a complete set
of i-CLDs was produced for the new empirical evidence base. All 41
i-CLDs created in this study are contained in the Supplementary
Information (B.). One of the i-CLDs is shown in Fig. 3 as an example.
Step IV reconciles the set of i-CLDs into a standardised format in order
to construct the f-CLD of the system of interest at the desired scale
and granularity. The standardisation process has two aspects. One aspect
is related to component (variables and links) definition, necessary to
maximise clarity of the f-CLD while covering all information contained
in the evidence base. This addresses the typical challenge of CLDs
becoming dense and overcomplicated, which decreases their utility. The
other aspect is related to level of aggregation, necessary to ensure the
f-CLD conveys information at the intended scale and granularity. The
standardisation is an iterative process, as follows. The \~950 variables
from the set of 41 i-CLDs were recorded on a blank worksheet for the
f-CLD, without links between them. A clustering approach was used to
reconcile these variables into like groups. For each group, an
overarching major node was isolated and the i-CLD variables in the group
were virtually deposited into a matrix for that major node. For example,
drought, sea level rise and crop disease were some of the i-CLD
variables clustered into an environmental risk factors f-CLD major node
matrix. The f-CLD major nodes were defined at a level of aggregation
representative of a nation. Doing so effectively scaled down any global
or regional aggregation, and scaled up any sub-national or local
aggregation, in the i-CLD variables. For example, household food imports
was an i-CLD variable of local aggregation that was scaled up to
national food imports (trade) in the f-CLD. The \~1150 links from the
set of 41 i-CLDs were reconciled into arrowed lines between the major
nodes in the f-CLD. This sometimes- required interpretation of implied
causality in the i-CLD relationships in order to route them across the
major nodes in the f-CLD. For example, where an i-CLD showed a direct
link from international food price to conflict variables, this was
routed using arrowed lines from international food price to national
food price to food accessibility to food insecurity and finally to
conflict major nodes defined in the f-CLD. Where there was a discrepancy
between relationship descriptions, the relationship with the most
supporting i-CLDs was adopted. The interim f-CLD produced at the end of
each standardisation iteration was examined to determine whether the
major node definition could be refined to maximise clarity. For example,
in one iteration water and land were defined as separate major nodes,
but examination determined that each had the same arrowed lines to other
major nodes; therefore, another iteration was undertaken with water and
land now clustered under a single natural resources major node in order
to minimise redundant arrowed lines. This process was iterated several
times until an f-CLD had been constructed at an appropriate level of
detail for this study. Additionally, relevant literature reviewed in
Section 290 was cross- referenced, but not included as evidence points,
to ensure comprehensive coverage of key relationships in the f-CLD. The
standard-format f-CLD, consisting of uncoloured and unweighted
components, resulting at the end of this step is contained in the
Supplementary Information (C.). Step V maps each i-CLD to the f-CLD
using a weighted (line thickness) typology (colour-coded) approach. This
visually documents the spread of the evidence base across the system
described by the f-CLD. The process to map an i-CLD to the f-CLD is as
follows. Each variable (node) of the i-CLD was assigned to its
corresponding major node(s) in the f-CLD. Each link (arrowed line) of
the i-CLD was assigned to a corresponding route along the arrowed lines
in the f-CLD. Each time an arrowed line in the f-CLD had an i-CLD link
assigned to it, an incremental weighting of one-unit line thickness in
the corresponding typology colour-coding of the i-CLD link was added to
the f-CLD arrowed line. This process was repeated for each of the 41
i-CLDs until all had been mapped to the f-CLD. A record of this process
for each of the 41 i-CLDs is contained in the Supplementary Information
(D.). The novel-format f-CLD, consisting of colour-coded and weighted
components, resulting at the end of this final step is presented in Fig.
5. 4. Results and Discussion The new empirical evidence base and
novel-format CLD of climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse in contemporary society resulting from the application of our
original methodology (Section 3) are discussed in turn below. 4.1.
Empirical evidence base of climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse in contemporary society The new empirical evidence base
(Section 3, Step I), along with its colour-coded typology (Section 3,
Step II), is presented in Fig. 4. It consists of 41 evidence points, of
which 9 examine the natural mortality (i.e. starvation, with respect to
food insecurity), 20 the conflict mortality and 12 the emigration
societal collapse proxy, alongside other human and natural world system
factors. We discuss three key aspects of the evidence base, namely
temporal and spatial distribution, data-driven method distribution, and
advantages of each data-driven methods, below. The temporal scale and
granularity of study varies across the evidence base; however, our
methodology limited the possible scale of study to the period from 1990
to present, representative of contemporary society. Within this period,
approximately half of the evidence points cover a scale of less than one
decade and the other half a scale of greater than one decade.
Approximately half of the evidence points conduct analyses at yearly
granularity and the other half conduct analyses at granularity greater
than one year, with only a few studies conducting analyses at monthly
granularity. The spatial scale and granularity of study varies across
the evidence base. Approximately one third of the evidence points
investigate the system at a global scale, with the remaining two thirds
focusing on regional or national scales, primarily in Africa as well as
the Middle East and Asia. Approximately half of the evidence points
analyse the causal pathway at sub-national granularity, with the other
half primarily focusing on national-level granularity. This variation
provided different coverage of the complex relationships within the
system, which was informative for constructing our CLD. The distribution
of data-driven methods used across the evidence base is notably
different for each societal collapse proxy. Evidence points for natural
mortality mostly use collection/analysis of interview/ survey data. This
is likely because the minimum daily food intake for human survival is
well established;91 as such, statistical analysis of food and mortality
data sets would not yield significantly new insights into thresholds
whereas interviews/surveys can provide insight into an individual's
circumstances influencing this relationship. Evidence points for
conflict mortality mostly use statistical analysis of existing datasets.
This likely reflects the interest in rigorously curated conflict
datasets, such as UCDP/PRIO,92 across the conflict and peace fields.
Evidence points for emigration mostly use collection/analysis of
interview/survey data, likely because this provides nuanced insight into
an individual's decision to migrate. It may also be due to data
availability and quality challenges that limit quantitative statistical
analyses, which are being addressed by groups such as the International
Organization for Migration's Global Migration Data Analysis Centre.93
Amongst these data challenges, it is important to recognise the issue of
reconciling different types of voluntary and forced migration with
causal drivers, given the complex social, economic and political factors
at play; this challenge similarly applies to the other societal collapse
proxies but is particularly noted in the migration studies. We observe
from these studies that a food insecurity threshold for natural
mortality is well established but thresholds for conflict mortality and
emigration are not. Indeed, distinguishing causal drivers within
datasets and defining quantitative thresholds for these determinants
remains a "grand challenge".94 \[FIGURE 4 REMOVED\] Each data-driven
method offers different advantages. The complex systems models each
describe "chunks" of the system at different scale and granularity. The
models provide mathematical definition, are calibrated to real-world
data and enable quantitative simulation of key relationships in the
system. The statistical analyses quantitatively examine relationships
between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables
within the system, which can be used as a mathematical basis for
extending modelling capabilities. The collection/ analysis of
interview/survey data provides insight into qualitative aspects of human
perspective and decision-making that quantitative data sets cannot
provide directly. The data-led case study/scenarios combine quantitative
data with qualitative expert interpretation to better understand global
trends and forecasts. These latter two methods can also be used to
inform the development of modelling capabilities, the scenarios analysed
by such models and their application in decision- making processes.
Collectively, these different data-driven methods can yield useful
insights into the nuances of relationships in the system of interest.
4.2. Causal loop diagram of the climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse in contemporary society at global scale and national
granularity The main result of this chapter is the CLD (the f-CLD from
Section 3, Step V), presented in Fig. 5. It structures the relationships
between climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse as
described in our new empirical evidence base (presented in Fig. 4 and
discussed in Section 4.1). We discuss three key aspects of the CLD,
namely insights related to the spread of empirical evidence, the
qualitative complex system depicted, and quantitative complex system
modelling, below, alongside consideration of well-established benefits
and limitations of CLDs. Our CLD is presented in a novel format that
documents the spread of our empirical evidence base. We use line
thickness and colour, respectively, to depict the density and type of
the data-driven methods used by the empirical evidence points to analyse
a given link between two variables. Doing this aids comprehension of
where existing work has been focused with respect to the climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway. It may also help
with the identification of gaps in existing analyses. For example, we
can see that the link between food insecurity and conflict has been
investigated mostly by evidence points using statistical analyses
(blue), whereas the links between food insecurity and migration, and
food insecurity and natural mortality, have been investigated mostly by
evidence points using interviews/surveys (green). This hints that it may
be useful to investigate the former using quantitative statistics, and
the latter using qualitative interviews/surveys, to gain further
insights offered by the different data-driven methods as described in
Section 4.1. It is important to recognise that our CLD may show
negligible density for important links or even be missing important
variables and/or links, either because they have not yet been studied or
because our key word search failed to identify evidence points that have
studied them. For example, our study focused on the climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway, so the density of our
empirical evidence is concentrated along links central to this pathway,
whereas the links between peripheral variables in the system, such as
between fertility and births, show a lower density of empirical
evidence. Similarly, our use of the population loss set of societal
collapse proxies means that the evidence base details natural mortality,
conflict mortality and emigration, whereas the institutional breakdown
set are not detailed. In considering this issue, our methodology
attempted to maximise the rigour and transparency of our study by
documenting the spread of our empirical evidence base to help make the
reader aware of exactly how much and what type of evidence was
supporting the CLD presented here. Further, we can see that while
empirical studies have linked climate change via food insecurity to our
societal collapse proxies of natural mortality, conflict mortality and
emigration, we found no empirical studies linking these proxies to the
explicit term of societal collapse. This was expected given the
motivation of this study (Section 1) and is due to the fact that there
are no contemporary events of societal collapse, under the same
definition as those in the historical studies pre-dating contemporary
society, that enable these links to be empirically studied.95 Having
considered the spread of empirical evidence, we now consider the complex
system documented. A key benefit of CLDs is that they simply present a
myriad of information in a single diagram; in doing so, CLDs enable
comprehension of the structure and behaviour of complex systems,
including feedbacks, intervention points and far- reaching
interdependencies.96 Our CLD visually depicts a system of 39 variables,
105 links and 32,000 feedback loops,97 integrating information from
different fields including climate science, food security, conflict,
migration and health research. Walking through the CLD at a high-level,
we can see how population growth and lifestyle emissions, influenced by
institutional/demographic factors (e.g. emission reduction incentives),
combine to directly drive climate change. Similarly, they indirectly
drive climate change via consumer demand on food production, which
produces emissions directly (e.g. ruminant livestock) and indirectly via
industrial capital/ output (e.g. processing factories). The
environmental risk factors (e.g. extreme weather events) of climate
change may cause losses of food production either directly (e.g. plant
disease) or indirectly via agricultural input availability (e.g. loss of
water source for irrigation). A country's food availability is
influenced by domestic food production and international food trade.
Food accessibility is influenced by its food price, which responds to
domestic (e.g. cost of food production and distribution) and
international (e.g. international food price) markets, and
institutional/demographic factors (e.g. food subsidies). Food
utilisation is influenced by infrastructure/services (e.g. education)
and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. cultural traditions). Food
insecurity is underpinned by these three pillars of food availability,
food accessibility and food utilisation. For a given country, food
insecurity can drive natural mortality (i.e. starvation), conflict and
migration, contributing to population loss, as well as economic shocks
and socio- political instability, contributing to institutional
breakdown, which exacerbates the risk of societal collapse.

While some of these relationships may appear obvious, it is the act of
bringing this information, which may otherwise be siloed and thus
preventing consideration of the full story, together in one place that
is of value.100 In doing so, our CLD attempts to provide readers with
the opportunity to explore the climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse causal pathway, consider worst-case scenarios that we
want to avoid, develop transformative narratives of "where we want to
go" and think about interventions that may help us attain this desired
future.101 It is important to appreciate that CLDs are only as good as
their information inputs; our CLD documents relationships based on
information portrayed in our empirical evidence base as well as our
interpretation of that information. As such, there exist challenges and
limitations.102 For instance, CLDs may mask variability of relationships
in different contexts and locations, because they can only depict a
single scale and granularity. The portrayal of explicit causality
between variables in a CLD is a challenge as this can often work in both
directions rather than one. CLDs can often become either too complicated
or too simplified, which undermines their usefulness. In considering
each of these issues, our original methodology attempted to maximise the
rigour and transparency of our study by first documenting the
information in each evidence point with an i-CLD and then consistently
applying, and recording, the iterative process of reconciling the
variables and links from each i-CLD to construct the f-CLD at the
selected global scale and national granularity. In doing so, we sought
to enable the reader to be aware of the nuances of the different scales
and granularity of information underpinning our CLD, as well as our
process of carefully reconciling causality, over 950 variables to 39
variables and 1150 links to 105 links to maximise the information
conveyed while balancing readability. It is also important to note that,
due to their qualitative and static nature, CLDs do not enable us to
comprehend the dynamics of the system, including nonlinear and emergent
behaviour, non-intuitive quantitative results and time delays.103
Complex systems models, although with their own challenges and
limitations,104 provide the opportunity to quantitatively analyse the
dynamics of a system and gain insights into the potentially far-reaching
impacts of our decisions.105 However, complex systems models that
explicitly examine societal collapse in contemporary society are
underdeveloped. The World3 system dynamics model106 --- an evidence
point in this study (refer to Supplementary Information D).107 --- is
the eminent model of relevance, with only a limited number of studies
building on it. World3 examines the potential for
"overshoot-and-collapse" given population and industrial growth within
the finite carrying capacity of the natural world system, implicitly
accounting for climate change and explicitly accounting for food
availability. The information contained in our CLD and empirical
evidence base may be useful in identifying and informing opportunities
to improve these existing complex systems modelling capabilities for
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse scenarios. For
example, our CLD highlights important factors at global scale and
national granularity that World3 does not incorporate because it is
defined at global scale and granularity.108 World3 does not distinguish
heterogenous characteristics of nations, such as distribution of
population or geographic endowment of natural resources. It also does
not account for international interactions, such as food trade, conflict
and migration. Relatedly, World3 evaluates societal collapse only by
natural mortality (defined by food availability, age and pollution) and
does not include the other two population loss secondary determinants,
as noted in the previous sentence, nor the three institutional breakdown
secondary determinants. While our empirical evidence base may provide
useful direction to datasets, it is important to note that
quantitatively defining these relationships, particularly thresholds as
discussed in Section 4.1, remains a key challenge of developing complex
systems models. Nonetheless, given that individuals associate with
national identity, business governance and policy-making are
concentrated at national level, and international interactions underpin
the functioning of contemporary society it could be valuable to model
societal collapse risk profiles of different nations to inform the
prioritisation and development of intervention strategies. \[FIGURE 5
REMOVED\] 5. Conclusions and Future Work This chapter identified an
empirical evidence base of climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse in contemporary society and structured the evidence base using
a novel-format CLD defined at global scale and national granularity. Two
types of future work could extend from the results of this chapter.
Identification of gaps in the spread of evidence across the CLD may
guide future data-driven efforts to examine these causal relationships
and define thresholds. The CLD and evidence base may be used to develop
quantitative modelling capabilities, particularly by transforming the
structure of World3 to account for heterogenous national characteristics
and international interactions. Three types of future work could extend
from the methodology and literature synthesis. The causal pathway
examined in this chapter could be further detailed by re-applying the
methodology using the institutional breakdown set of societal collapse
proxies instead of the population loss set. The methodology, using
either set of societal collapse proxies, could be applied to detail
other causal pathways between climate change and societal collapse. The
methodology, excluding the contemporary time- period limitation, could
be applied to document the information in the historical studies
identified in the literature review. Similarly, the methodology could be
applied to construct CLDs at different scales and granularities. It is
hoped that this chapter has contributed to developing our understanding
of the causal pathways through which climate change poses an existential
risk to humanity and facilitates opportunities for future work.

Highlights:

• In this short chapter the authors draw on several research strands and
papers within CSER to offer a theoretical reflection on how to think
about catastrophic climate change and what Existential Risk Studies can
learn from climate change research.

• [This is intended to **build** on the **previous chapter**, in
which]{.underline} Catherine [Richards]{.underline}, Richard [Lupton,
and]{.underline} Julian [Allwood provide an empirical assessment of one
highly concerning **risk cascade**]{.underline} involving climate change
and highlight its potential contribution to global catastrophic and
existential risk.

• Climate change is one of the most empirically well-studied risks and
has deep links to pre-existing bodies of literature, such as disaster
risk management, environmental studies, and food security.

• Drawing on these studies and more, the chapter reflects on how to
frame research questions in existential risk, what causes catastrophic
climate change to be neglected by climate and existential risk
researchers alike, and how to incorporate assessments of response risk
and co-benefits into thinking about catastrophic climate change. This
short chapter brings together a number of important ideas and draws
readers attention to other extant bodies of literature. The relative
value of co-benefits approaches is discussed in other chapters in this
volume, including Chapter 4, in more detail. The dangers of response
risks are further discussed in Chapter 2.

1\. Asking the Wrong Questions for the Right Reasons

Within Existential Risk Studies [it is **common** to hear people
ask]{.underline} the question ["[is climate change]{.mark} an
**[existential]{.mark}**]{.underline} risk[[?]{.mark}", and
**many**]{.underline} who ask this question [answer **negatively**,
arguing that]{.underline} as a result [climate change is **not** an
**important topic** of research]{.underline} within the field. However,
whether it is answered affirmatively or not, [this question [is
**misguided**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are three reasons for thinking
this. Firstly, [it makes **little sense** on a **probabilistic** level;
whether something will be a **threat** to our collective existence is
**not**]{.underline} a **[binary]{.underline}** matter, [it is a
question of **likelihood**.]{.underline} However, [many **researchers**
within Existential Risk Studies **mistakenly** conflict **existential
risk** with events that could be **existential
catastrophes**]{.underline}. Secondly, [[climate change is
**not**]{.mark} a **single [uniform]{.mark} process** that will affect
everyone in the **same** way; [it is a set of **diffuse
impacts**]{.mark}]{.underline} to different exposed populations,
[interacting with different **vulnerabilities** and exposures, and
[activating different]{.mark} **risk [cascades]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
As Richards et al. show, [[it will]{.mark} **inevitably** [interact
with]{.mark} a host of **other threats**]{.underline} ([not only **[food
security]{.mark}** and [societal **collapse**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but
even factors such as the explosivity of [volcanic [**eruptions**
or]{.mark} the emergence of zoonotic
**[pathogens]{.mark}**]{.underline}),1 [[and]{.mark} these can
**interact** with one another to [create]{.mark}]{.underline}
reinforcing feedback loops or [**"[global]{.mark} systems [death
spirals]{.mark}"**.]{.underline}2 Finally, " existential risk" is too
vague and arbitrary a concept for the question to ever be answered. All
the definitions of existential risk that have received the greatest
public attention thus far, such as Toby Ord's, focused not in terms of
an impact on humanity at any point in time but rather in terms of "the
loss of long-term future value";3 either referring to the author(s)
particular vision of a high-tech intergalactic utopia, or a fuzzy
undefined idea of "our potential".4

We are better off reverting back to the common-sense definition of
existential risk as the risk to the existence of a given object, and
specifying whether the object under threat is humanity as a whole (
extinction risk), global industrial society (collapse risk), or
something else entirely. We should be thinking of an overall level of
risk emergent from a particular socio-ecological system, and how much
climate change influences this level.7 And the question we should be
asking about this risk is what contribution, under certain scenarios,
climate change will make, bearing in mind that it will almost certainly
be operating in tandem with many other drivers of risk.

Considering this revised question can also help to rectify [a
**recurring problem** in the climate risk literature: using **mean
global temp**erature rise as the **sole threat** indicator]{.underline}.
Authors and activists alike have frequently made a direct link between
the level of warming and the likelihood of global catastrophe, with 4--6
°C being most frequently used as this terrible threshold.8 However,
[global surface temperature is **only one** of the climate change
induced **factors**]{.underline} we need [to **worry**
about]{.underline}. 3 °C of warming above pre-industrial levels could be
entirely manageable if it occurs in a world of adaptive technologies,
high levels of multilateral cooperation, wealth equality, trust in
institutions, and the safe management of other planetary boundaries. [It
could also be **catastrophic** in a world where other planetary
**boundaries** are **transgressed**, the international order is
**riven** with **conflict**, lethal **autonomous weapons** are
in]{.underline} mass [production, and societies are scarred by
**inequality**, low trust, and **polarisation**]{.underline}.
Understanding the contribution of [climate change]{.underline} to Global
Catastrophic Risk [requires a more **sophisticated** approach which
looks **beyond** the **direct impacts**]{.underline} of a given level of
warming [to think through **fully formed** climate
**scenarios**]{.underline}. We believe that, when conceived of in this
way, the risks associated with climate change are more appreciable and
it is far harder to argue that understanding them is unimportant;
however, even if others disagree with this assessment, we still maintain
that [this is the **right way** to think about the problem.]{.underline}

2\. Catastrophic Neglect

Given how poorly questions about [catastrophic **climate
change**]{.underline} are often framed, it is hardly surprising that it
[has been a highly **neglected** subject of study]{.underline}, not only
among existential risk researchers but also among climate change
researchers. Even at the basic level of temperature rise scenarios, [we
give far **more attention** to studying the impacts of **lower- end**
warming rather than [**high-end** warming]{.mark}. Text-mining of **IPCC
reports** shows that mentions of **3 °**]{.underline}C [and above [is
**underrepresented**]{.mark} relative to its **likelihood**]{.underline}
(and impact),9 a finding that has been [verified by both **literature
sampling** and the reports of **popular authors** trying to
summarise]{.underline} the [climate risk science]{.underline}.10 If
anything, [[this]{.mark} trend appears to have [**worsened** over time
with]{.mark} subsequent **[IPCC reports]{.mark}**]{.underline}.111 The
[[use of **complex**]{.mark} risk **[assessments]{.mark}** to study
climate scenarios [has]{.mark} also [been **neglected**]{.mark}: looking
at **compound hazards** is already **rare**,]{.underline}12 [let alone
considering **risk cascades** and **integrated** climate
**catastrophe**]{.underline} assessments. Yet catastrophic climate
change remains high on the public and political agenda, creating both a
perception that this is a risk receiving far more attention than it is,
and also an intellectual vacuum that is easily filled by poor quality
research, ranging from speculative doom-mongering13 to overly simplistic
neoclassical economic models.14

[There are four key reasons for this **oversight** of extreme global
**climate risk**]{.underline}. First is international climate policy.
The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement on Climate Change has channelled
scientific attention toward the agreement's goal of limiting warming to
2 °C above pre- industrial levels and pursuing efforts to stabilise it
below 1.5 °C, as these are now the publicly stated goals of climate
negotiations (even if they are highly unlikely to actually be realised).
Second, [analysis of high-end warming scenarios and **[complex]{.mark}**
risk [assessments are]{.mark} simply **[harder]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
do. [The **higher** the warming gets, the **more difficult** it becomes
to **study**]{.underline}, as these scenarios are more displaced for the
current climatic niche. Moreover, complex [climate risk **assessments**
involving **multiple factors** are far **more challenging**]{.underline}
than a hazard-centric analysis focusing on only the direct impacts of
mean global temperature rise. Third, [climate [**scholarship**
has]{.mark} had a strong [**incentive** to "**err** on the side of
**least drama**]{.mark}"]{.underline}.15 [Climate change has long been
the **target** of **[fossil-fuel]{.mark}** industry
**[campaigns]{.mark}** to **[sow doubt]{.mark}**, not just on attempts
to assess]{.underline} climate change's [catastrophic potential but even
the **fundamental science**, [and]{.mark} this **[create]{.mark}**s
incentives for [**conservative science** that builds
**consensus**]{.mark} and does not risk exploring **divergent
hypotheses**]{.underline}.16 Finally, [many fear that discussing
**extreme risk** could cause people to **dwell too much** on worst case
scenarios, breeding **fatalism**]{.underline} and ~~paralysis~~.
However, this concern is misplaced; meta-analyses over hopeful vs.
fearful messaging are mixed,17 and in any case this is a false
dichotomy. One of the most referenced pieces for those concerned about
the paralytic effect of fear does show that hopeful messaging is more
poignant than fear but also that "worry" is even more effective than
hope.18 The difference between worry and fear is one of degrees; the
latter could even dissipate into the former over time. Furthermore,
research should not be a PR exercise aimed to sway the public, in open
democracies we have a duty to do honest risk assessments combined with
clear recommendations for what can be done.19

Of course, these factors are only compounded by the consensus procedures
of the IPCC, which seeks to synthesise scientific evidence for political
purposes but is still often held up as a neutral arbiter of climate
science. While useful, these procedures tend to produce lowest
common-denominator outcome, which is precisely what is not needed when
exploring extreme risks.20 This is an important point of reflection for
any future efforts to build similar bodies aimed at bringing scientific
research to bear on the governance of other global risks.

3\. The Risks and Rewards of Responding

Climate change is inherently tractable and we already have the
technologies we need to stop creating it, albeit without the
institutions to fairly distribute them with a sufficient level of
urgency. However, responding to risks like climate change can incur
risks of its own. Indeed, the IPCC, in its risk concept notes to the
sixth assessment report, does not just discuss the usual three
determinants of risk, hazard, vulnerability, and exposure, but also
identifies " response risks".21 Others have suggested that response
should be added to the classic list of determinants.22 In some cases,
responses may be far worse than the initial perceived risk, that is,
they are iatrogenic: the treatment is worse than the disease.

Existential risk is especially prone to response risks due to its scale,
severity, and often speculative nature. For instance, at the extreme a
speculative fear of dispersed weapons of mass destruction could justify
a mass surveillance state.23 In general, there is always the potential
for concerns over global risk to justify a Stomp Reflex --- the abuse of
emergency powers which inappropriately empower those atop a hierarchy
and shield them from scrutiny. 24 This is also true for climate change

Reacting to climate change could lead to [[**emergency** responses, such
as]{.mark} stratospheric aerosol injection]{.underline}
(**[[SAI]{.underline}]{.mark}**), in an attempt [to **manipulate** the
quantity of **solar radiation** hitting the earth]{.underline} and thus
counter some of the impacts of climate change. Existing data on the
direct impacts of SAI and its **[[contribut]{.underline}]{.mark}**ion
[[to systemic risk]{.mark} or [triggering]{.mark} other
**hazards**]{.underline} is sparse. Preliminary analysis suggests that
[the **greatest problem** is the latent risks of "**[termination
shock]{.mark}**".]{.underline} [[If]{.mark} a **[calamity]{.mark}** such
as a nuclear war [**deactivates** the system]{.mark}]{.underline} for a
prolonged time, then [[this could **significantly accelerate**
warming]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hence [SAI **shifts** the risk
distribution by]{.underline} likely lowering the level of risk in an
average scenario [but **fattening** the tail or **"worst-case"**
scenarios]{.underline} depending on how SAI is deployed, to what degree
it is used, and what geopolitical and ecological world it is dispersed
into.25 On the other hand, there are also frequently neglected
co-benefits of climate mitigation policies, such as the public health
benefits of eliminating coal smoke and other pollutants from our air.26

Such problems of response risk are perhaps the most neglected. Yet they
are precisely what the study of existential risk needs to grapple with.
This could include by using robust decision-making procedures, such as
the minimax principle, to aid in selecting policy options under
uncertainty or using deliberative democratic processes to combine
diverse perspectives and co-create effective policy responses.

[[An array of climate changes in the Arctic is now documented]{.mark} by
observing systems, [with more expected with future greenhouse gas-driven
climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}. Observed [[physical changes in the
Arctic include warming ocean, soil, and air temperatures; melting
permafrost; shifting vegetation and animal abundances; and altered
characteristics of Arctic cyclones]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These changes
continue to affect traditional livelihoods and cultures in the region,
infrastructure, and the economy, as well as the distribution and health
of animal populations and vegetation. [The changes raise risks of
pollution, food supply, safety, cultural losses, and national
security]{.mark}]{.underline}. The state government of Alaska concluded
that observed climate changes "have resulted in a reduction of
subsistence harvests, an increase in flooding and erosion, concerns
about water and food safety and major impacts to infrastructure:
including damage to buildings, roads and airports."61 A monitoring
report of the Arctic Council concluded in 2019 that [[the Arctic
biophysical system is]{.mark} now clearly [trending]{.mark} away from
its previous state]{.underline} \[in the 20th century\] [and [into a
period of unprecedented change, with implications]{.mark} not only
within but also [beyond the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.62 A few broad
points raise particular concerns about changes in the Arctic: • [Long
lag times between cause and full effects: [Changes once set in motion
prompt further and often slow effects in different components of the
Arctic system, such as the influence of rising atmospheric temperatures
on ocean and permafrost temperatures. Scientists expect the full effects
of near-term climate changes to play out over a period of decades to
many centuries]{.mark}.]{.underline} • [Feedbacks that mostly further
increase warming: [Greenhouse gas-induced warming leads to]{.mark}
positive ([enhancing]{.mark}) and some negative (dampening) [feedbacks
within the Arctic system, which scientists expect in net to amplify
warming]{.mark} and pursuant effects]{.underline}. For example,
temperature-driven melting sea ice reduces reflection of incoming solar
energy, leading to absorption by the Arctic Ocean and further warming of
the ocean and the planet. • Abrupt change risks: The freezing point for
water, including permafrost, is one example of thresholds that certain
Arctic systems may cross, leading to rapid state changes. • [Risks of
irreversibilities: [Some Arctic climate impacts, such as loss of sea ice
and glaciers, may lead to system changes that scientists expect would be
irreversible on a human timescale,]{.mark}]{.underline} even if
temperatures stabilize (at a higher level than today)

#### Arctic Climate Change accelerates warming trends globally, creates massive feedback loops which increase the speed of warming. Action now is key

In 2016, nearly 200 world leaders pledged to do everything possible to
limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since then, policymakers
across the globe have designed countless laws around the assumption that
warming would never cross that threshold. But scientists have some
sobering news to share: [[Earth exceeded 1.5 degrees of warming in 2024,
it\'s hurtling]{.mark} fast [toward]{.mark} even [more]{.mark}
warming]{.underline}, and it has already changed in irreversible ways.
According to research published on Thursday, Feb. 6 in Science, even if
every country kept its current Paris Agreement pledges---and that\'s a
big if---the globe will still be on course to warm 2.7 degrees Celsius,
or 4.9 degrees Fahrenheit, by the year 2100. \"[[This is a reality
check]{.mark}:]{.underline} We took a first step by signing the Paris
Agreement, but [we\'re already living in the \'changed world\' we are
attempting to prevent]{.underline},\" said Regents\' Professor of
Ecosystem Ecology Ted Schuur of Northern Arizona University. \"[It\'s
time to take the next step to adjust our climate goals to accommodate
this new reality.\"]{.underline} Why did we pass 1.5 degrees of warming
so much sooner than we imagined? [[It\'s]{.mark} partly to do with
what\'s happening above [the Arctic]{.mark} Circle]{.underline}, Schuur
said. A changed cryosphere Research summarized by Schuur and his
colleagues in a polar-focused edition of Science shows that the [Arctic
is warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the
world]{.underline}. Why? Because its frozen surfaces are melting. Take
sea ice, for example. [Before current global warming, the Arctic Ocean
would reliably freeze over in the winter and partially melt in
summer]{.underline}. But [now]{.underline} that the globe has surpassed
1.5 degrees of warming, [a greater portion of winter ice melts with
every passing summer, leaving more and more ocean exposed through late
fall. That accelerates warming because dark-colored ocean water absorbs
more sun than light-colored ice sheets.]{.underline} \"[The Arctic seas
have already become unrecognizable]{.underline},\" Schuur said. \"The
amount of ice we\'re left with at the end of the summer keeps declining
over time. Soon enough, [summer ice could become a thing of the
past\"---changing the lives of people who live in the region, opening up
new shipping routes and, undoubtedly, unleashing new international
relations quagmires.]{.underline} On land, warming is affecting the
Arctic no less dramatically. [As temperatures increase, huge swaths of
ground that were underlain by [permafrost are thawing, releasing]{.mark}
long-sequestered [carbon]{.mark} into the air as greenhouse gases.
Scientists have predicted that as warming continues, [this]{.mark}
decomposing organic matter [will]{.mark} release amounts of carbon
dioxide and methane that are comparable to the carbon emissions of large
industrialized nations.]{.underline} Unfortunately, Schuur said, [these
phenomena didn\'t factor adequately into policymakers\' calculations in
2016.]{.underline} \"We\'re talking about a place that\'s remote to many
people, but [changes in the Arctic don\'t stay in the
Arctic]{.underline},\" he said. \"[Once we lose that \'freezer\' of
organic material, it turns into greenhouse gases that go into the
atmosphere and [accelerate warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. Last summer,
Phoenix had 70 days with temperatures over 110. That\'s mainly due to
human greenhouse gas emissions, [but it was accelerated in part due to
additional greenhouse gases from the Arctic.\"]{.underline} Adapting to
a warmer world Schuur said it\'s now clear that current policy targets
will warm the globe 2.7 degrees by the end of this century, creating an
even warmer world than the one we are experiencing today. It\'s now our
collective task to make communities more resilient to the inevitable
change ahead and try to reduce further human greenhouse gas emissions.
\"We can\'t stop change from happening; it\'s already happening,\"
Schuur said. \"But [[we can slow the change by reducing greenhouse gas
emissions]{.mark} and managing the change as best as we can so that
people and ecosystems are better positioned for the
future.\"]{.underline} Schuur encouraged people to get involved in their
city, county or state sustainability efforts, as those can be more
direct. Involvement could mean attending civic meetings or bringing new
policy ideas to leaders, or it could simply mean supporting
sustainability measures by voting in local elections. He also advised
people to keep taking individual action. In the face of bad news, it can
seem like your electric car, solar panels and reusable mug aren\'t
making a difference. Schuur explained that those choices may not halt
warming in its tracks, but they still help slow the rate of warming.
\"Don\'t give up, even in the face of change,\" Schuur said. \"Instead,
change your thinking. Say to yourself: I live in a new, changed world.
What can I do to help adapt and slow the change so we have more time to
adjust?\"

Overall, alternative ways are needed in world/planetary politics. One of
the most useful and practical is cooperation, mostly across borders.
Being flexible and practice- oriented, it is mutually beneficial and
encourages sharing, and creates reciprocity. Furthermore, functional
cooperation, in fields of low politics, could be interpreted as a
confidence-building measure, where a political will for a dialogue 'can
be achieved by "agreeing to disagree". . . \[without reaching\] a
consensus on ultimate truth claims'.47 Finally, the Essay concludes by
provoking that environmental security is a 'must', and military security
is a substitution of environmental security. VI More factors indicate,
and more actors interpret, that the ecological catastrophe, including
the climate crisis---not geopolitical tensions or great power
rivalries--- is the biggest security threat that people and modern
societies face by making the industrial civilization and the entire
global system fragile and putting it at risk of collapse. Hence, though
modern societies are consciously taking bigger risks, concerning the
environment and the safety of people, and human kind uses to lean on a
faith of technology, environmental security is a must. Unlike, as the
two citations in the Introduction indicate, military security---
preparing for a war, threating of use of forces and fighting against an
hypothetical external enemy---is a part of the problem. It uses a big
part of natural resources (strategic minerals) and energy (oil), uses
intellectual resources and advanced tech- nologies and causes
environmental risks (nuclear accidents). Armies are special and
protected polluters (radioactive and toxic wastes), and causeand
accelerate environ- mental degradation and carbon emissions. Even worse,
military security---as the mainstream concept of the unified State
system---has overtaken security discourses and marginalized the
environment, as well as occupied the minds of political and economic
elites, technocrats and media, all of which is taken from climate change

(rapid) global warming is a fact. An urgent question remains---whether
humankind would aim to make peace with the environment

How the Russia-Ukraine War Has Impacted the Arctic [[The Arctic]{.mark}
Circle [is of utmost importance to various nations]{.mark} for clear
financial, political, and social reasons, the region [being key to the
global]{.mark} oil and gas industry, to [scientific research,]{.mark}
and to the fishing industry.]{.underline} According to the Atlantic
Council1) [[the Arctic]{.mark} Circle ["provides researchers with the
means to almost predict the effects of climate change through polar
amplification]{.mark}---the phenomenon where changes to our climate tend
to produce more extensive changes near the poles than the planetary
average---[showing what the future will hold]{.mark}," holds an
impressive amount of oil and natural gas, "[is the perfect incubator for
clean energy,"]{.mark} and also allows for faster shipping, which
immeasurable helps international business, travel, and communications.
[The disruption of these programs in the wake of the Russian invasion
spells trouble for the global community]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
In early March of 2022, roughly fifteen days since the beginning of
Russia's invasion, the Wilson Center held an event titled "Ukraine and
the Arctic: Perspectives, Impacts, and Implications". One panelist, Dr.
Michael Sfraga, the Chair of the US Arctic Research Commission and
founding director of The Polar Institute, described how the Ukraine
crisis has and will affect the Arctic impressively. He states, "[[There
is a wide array of social, cultural, environmental, economic, political
aspects of the Arctic that, at this moment, are feeling the tensions
originating in Europe]{.mark} ... we see how connected, interdependent,
and integrated we really are]{.underline}".2) The same day this panel
was held, "Seven of the Arctic Council's eight members --- all except
Russia, which currently holds the council's rotating chairmanship ---
have agreed to boycott future meetings ... indefinitely \[pausing\]
council proceedings on issues from climate change to Arctic oil
drilling".3) This effectively halted all kinds of work being performed
in the Arctic given Russia is such a massive partner to various projects
in the region. [With the conflict now drawn out for over two years with
no end in sight, it is apparent now how the invasion has affected the
Arctic. [The Arctic Council's determination to boycott future meetings
has substantially changed]{.mark} the way in which governance will
occur]{.underline}. While the removal of Russia from the Council does
allow for a temporary end to "\[Russian\] participation in one of its
few remaining soft power venues capable of meaningful international
coordination", it also means the Council "forfeit [[the institutional
legitimacy and progress \[it\] has fostered"]{.underline}]{.mark} with
"[little utility \[existing\] in such an organization without
Moscow]{.underline}".4) This spells severe problems for the Arctic as
the Council can no longer claim to be fully or wholly immune to armed
geopolitical conflicts and also indicates that the Council will "lose
legitimacy and goodwill and its agenda will shrink in both scope and
size as future Russian statements on Arctic cooperation will likely be
met with more skepticism from the other seven members than ever
before".5) In July 2022, the Arctic Council announced it would resume
limited work "in projects that do not involve the participation of the
Russian federation," posing serious problems for future governance
policies in the Arctic for 2023.6) From a climate and scientific
research standpoint, [[Russia is a key figure in "tracking changes such
as permafrost degradation and methane emissions from warming
landscapes," yet this work has now been halted due to Russia's actions
in Ukraine and the international community's desire to pressure Russia
into submission]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some academics focusing on climate
issues argued that "\[the breakdown in relations is\] significantly
worse now because of the open warfare".7)

Arctic Peatlands Expand As reported by Mirage News on June 19, a study
published in Communications Earth & Environment found that Arctic
peatlands in Europe and Canada have expanded over the past 40 years. Led
by researchers at the University of Exeter, the study used satellite
imagery, drones, and field observations to document increased plant
growth at the edges of existing peatlands. The researchers attribute
this growth to a warming climate, which has lengthened growing seasons
and enhanced plant productivity. (Mirage News) Take 5[: [The recent
expansion of Arctic peatlands]{.underline}]{.mark}, as documented by the
University of Exeter, [[underscores the complex interplay between
climate change and carbon dynamics]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}.
Historically, [[Arctic peatlands have acted as significant carbon
sinks]{.mark} as they can store vast amounts of carbon dioxide and
methane]{.underline}. However, the observed growth in these ecosystems
suggests only a temporary increase in carbon sequestration capacity.
This phenomenon is primarily due to extended growing seasons and
enhanced plant growth facilitated by rising temperatures. Despite the
short-term benefits, scientists are cautioning that [widespread
continued warming still poses a significant risk. [As temperatures rise
further, these peatlands may transition]{.mark} from carbon sinks [to
carbon sources]{.mark}. The [thawing of permafrost]{.mark} and changes
in moisture conditions [could lead to the release of stored greenhouse
gases]{.mark}, particularly methane. This release could [accelerate
climate change, and result in a feedback loop that exacerbates
warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. The findings [[highlight the urgent need
for comprehensive climate policies that consider the dynamic nature of
Arctic ecosystems, and]{.mark} increased monitoring and preservation of
peatlands, as they are crucial to mitigating potential carbon emissions
and are important ecosystems.]{.underline} Furthermore, [these
developments [emphasize the importance of international cooperation in
Arctic research and conservation efforts, as what happens in the Arctic
does not stay in the Arctic]{.mark}. As the Arctic continues to warm at
an unprecedented rate, understanding and managing its carbon dynamics
will be pivotal in global climate change mitigation
strategies]{.underline}. (Nature, The Guardian)

Influence of the Ukraine war on China's Arctic collaboration In the
Arctic, the influence of the 2022 invasion on collaboration is clear.24)
The beginning of the war in 2014 did not yet break Arctic collaboration.
However, the 2022 invasion has escalated the geopolitical tensions in
the Arctic: as a response to Russia's attack on Ukraine, the seven other
Arctic states have refused to participate in official collaboration
under the auspices of the Arctic Council.25) Consequently, many [[Arctic
scientific projects and other collaborations have been on
hold]{.underline}]{.mark},26) [[and especially research on Arctic
climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} has become challenging, if not
impossible.27) While Chinese scholars can continue their research
collaboration with Russian colleagues, the pause of the Arctic Council
during Russia's chairmanship also prevented Chinese diplomats and
scientists from participating in regional collaboration.28) [[If the
activities of the Arctic Council working groups fail to be
resumed]{.underline}]{.mark},29) [[there are no regional platforms where
China and other non-Arctic states could contribute to regional
governance]{.underline}]{.mark} and implement their political agendas in
the Arctic. **[[Without Russia's participation,]{.underline}]{.mark}**
however, **[[the development of new forms of collaboration will be

**[Climate Change Impact Multiplier]{.underline}**

conflict with Russia and China**

The Department of Defense conceptualizes [[climate change]{.mark} as an
abstract security challenge -- [a "threat multiplier" that can
accelerate, ]{.mark}]{.underline}exacerbate, or set in motion -- but not
precipitate -- [[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the 2030s and beyond,
however, [there will be a paradigm shift that forces policymakers,
analysts, and strategists to also contend [with the direct
consequences]{.mark} of climate change [on]{.mark} geopolitical
positions and [the balance of power]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Nowhere is
this]{.mark} phenomenon [more]{.mark} visible and [imminent than the
Arctic]{.mark} Circle]{.underline}, where retreating ice shelves will
soon modify the fundamental characteristics of regional geography.
[Russia]{.underline}, for instance, [stands to both gain and lose
strategic advantages due to the melting Arctic]{.underline}. Certainly,
ice-free Arctic waterways and coastlines will ameliorate the pressure on
Russia to expand its frontiers along the Black Sea. Russia's pursuit of
perennial warm-water ports and securing unencumbered access to global
sea lines of communication is an established imperative in Russian grand
strategy extending back to the reign of Peter the Great. In essence,
[Russia needs ports that can handle commerce and support naval power
projection without interruption from winter freezes]{.underline}, a
standard most of its ports fail to meet. Indeed, well before Putin
gambled with absorbing Ukraine altogether, he made certain to capture
Crimea and its warm deep-water jewel of Sevastopol. Yet, [Arctic climate
change imposes greater liabilities on Russia's geostrategic position
than it offers]{.underline}. Particularly, as Arctic temperatures rise,
[[Russia's]{.mark} northern coastline and infrastructure are likely to
suffer destabilizing levels of erosion from thawing
permafrost]{.underline}, which will compound with rising tides. Russia's
paramount challenge from ice-free Arctic waters, however, will be [the
[under-protected new flank along its]{.mark} substantial [15,000 mile
northern coastline]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Russia was plugging this
security gap with a steady Arctic re-militarization until the Ukraine
war derailed those efforts]{.underline}. Now, Russia is diverting
military and economic resources that could otherwise be going towards
polar fortification and port infrastructure, [leaving this front exposed
l]{.underline}ikely until the far future. Moreover, [a defrosted Arctic
Ocean deprives Russia's submarine-based nuclear deterrent of concealment
underneath the ice sheets. Accounting for these costs, climate change
[is likely to transform Russia into a less secure state that is also
more likely to overcompensate for newfound vulnerability with
belligerence]{.mark}. Another challenge posed by the warming Arctic will
be [the emergence of trade routes]{.mark} that [empower Chinese
commercial interests. Arctic shipping corridors]{.mark}]{.underline},
including the seasonally traversable Northwest Passage, Northern Sea
Route, and the prospective but currently nonviable Transpolar Sea Route,
[hold immense promise for [revolutionizing global supply
chains]{.mark}]{.underline}. A journey from Europe to Asia can take 22
days via the Suez Canal versus 10 days through the Arctic, with the
potential to outpace overland Silk Road rail routes, resulting in
appreciable fuel and opportunity cost savings. Container ships
transiting the Panama and Suez Canals must also cap their cargo tonnage
to control how deep they sit in the water, a limitation that Arctic
shipping routes don't have. Not to mention, these canals are prone to
blockages like the Ever Given incident, which cost the global economy
\$60 Billion. However, [the benefits of Arctic trade mainly accrue to
China since these shipping lanes compress the distance between Asia and
Europe without improving upon routes from the U.S.]{.underline} If
warming sufficiently diminishes Arctic ice, [then [China will enjoy
easier access to Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}an [markets. In addition to
commercial earnings, [China could exploit these new inroads]{.mark} to
expand its market share of European imports and exports, a maneuver that
would likely be accompanied by greater influence and
leverage]{.underline}. Of course, [raw economic gains are also readily
translatable [into military power]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ultimately,
[with its Polar Silk Road initiative, [China intends to take full
advantage of the commercial opportunities afforded by the warming Arctic
to further realize its hegemonic ambitions]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Moreover, [[the U.S. may feel compelled to assert itself in the Arctic
in order to seize its vast rare earth element (REE) deposits]{.mark},
not for the sake of wealth but because China's multi-decade push to
consolidate control over global REE supply chains leaves the U.S. with
few other options]{.underline}. Indeed, the Department of Defense
recently halted the delivery of F-35s after discovering that an engine
subcomponent was being made with a cobalt and samarium alloy from China.
[Clearly, for the U.S. [to continue furnishing its armed forces with
advanced equipment]{.mark} and maintain an edge in the military balance
of power by extension, it will need to secure new REE supply chains that
are ideally defensible and closer to home.]{.underline} Like it or not,
[[geography is a determinant of security.]{.mark} [As warming reshapes
the Arctic theatre, American strategists should also anticipate how this
will reshape the priorities, calculus, and behavior of its
adversaries.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The Arctic faces a climate emergency. The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and Russia should be working together to understand the
deepening crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}---a global security threat.
Instead, essential cooperation is fractured. [Warming at a rate four
times faster than the rest of the world, the Arctic is
disproportionately affected by global warming]{.underline}: sea ice is
diminishing, coastlines are eroding, [[ecosystems are
collapsing]{.mark}, and there are [existential risks to local
communities and Indigenous livelihoods]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The Arctic
climate crisis is the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other
regions. [The]{.mark} transforming [Arctic has direct consequences on
warming]{.mark} and rising sea levels [around the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline} Meanwhile, scientific cooperation to
understand these processes has been blunted since Vladimir Putin's
decision to send troops into Ukraine in 2022. Following the escalation
of violence, joint projects, information sharing and expert working
groups between Russian and Western researchers and institutes were
severed. [[Arctic cooperation has a nearly century-long history of
successful initiatives]{.mark} based on mutual interest despite
political differences between states. [The sharing of data,
international polar expeditions, and collaborative research are critical
for constructing climate models and prognoses as well as informing
effective adaptation and mitigation policies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Arctic Council Pause Now, this crucial research is jeopardized as
international collaboration with Russia has been abandoned or
terminated. In 2022, the Western Arctic states condemned Russia's
military actions in Ukraine and paused the work of the Arctic Council.
The White House also announced a termination of scientific cooperation
with Russia. Russia had been the chair of the Council (2021--23) when
the pause was announced. Russian Arctic officials called the pause
"regrettable" and stressed the legacy of depoliticized dialogue. Since
its founding in 1996, the Arctic Council has been an exemplar of
constructive post--Cold War diplomacy. Nominated for the Nobel Prize
countless times, the Arctic Council is an intergovernmental forum for
the eight Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway,
Russia, Sweden, and the US), Indigenous peoples' representatives, non-
governmental and international organizations, non-Arctic states, and
experts to cooperate in understanding Arctic climate change, sustainable
development, and environmental protection. [Since 2022, international
scientists have lamented the dismal state of Arctic scientific
cooperation.]{.underline} [Russia comprises 53 percent of the Arctic
coastline and over half of the Arctic human and wildlife population;
[excluding the Russian Arctic]{.mark} limits our collective knowledge on
thawing permafrost, wildfires, polar bears and transforming
ecosystems]{.underline}. One geophysicist from the University of Alaska
said that [studying permafrost without Russian data is "like removing a
couple of wheels from a car and trying to drive it home."]{.underline} A
2024 research article found that [the current exclusion of Russia from
coordinated Arctic research [has significantly deteriorated scientists'
ability to track and further predict the risks exposed by climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Indigenous peoples of the North, who
have lived in the Arctic for millennia, likewise bemoan the gaps in
scientific data and the welfare of their circumpolar families.
Indigenous peoples were not consulted by the Arctic states prior to the
pause. Previously, the Arctic Council was regarded as the only platform
where Indigenous peoples have inclusion in decision-making at the global
level. Restoring Cooperation Two years into the war in Ukraine, there
are some headways in Russia-West Arctic cooperation. Norway took over
the chair of the Arctic Council in 2023 and is gradually resuming work
with Russia. In February 2024, the council announced that official
meetings of project and expert working groups will resume in a digital
format. A month before, Norway's chief Arctic official, Morten Høglund,
met in person with the six Indigenous peoples' organizations, including
two representatives from Russia. Norway's relationship with Russia can
serve as an example for dealing with Russia under the current political
circumstances. In recent years, Norway has imposed sanctions against
Russia, signed a bilateral defense agreement with the United States, and
hosted NATO troops in the largest military exercise since the Cold War.
At the same time, Norway continues collaboration with Russia to comanage
fisheries in the Barents Sea, the Norwegian-Russian border, and Coast
Guard rescue operations. Similarly, the United States maintains some
channels of cooperation with Russia in the Arctic, especially in the
Bering Strait. The US and Russian Coast Guards maintain lines of
communication to protect people and marine resources on both sides of
the strait. While joint exercises have been on hold, the US and Russian
Coast Guards still commit to the enduring agreements on
search-and-rescue and emergency operations. Cooperation continues even
against the background of provocative Russian naval exercises off the
coast of Alaska. Moreover, there is collaboration at the individual and
informal levels. Some academic conferences in the US and Russia, where
scientists share research on Arctic natural and social sciences, still
involve Russian and American researchers. Such developments demonstrate
that while relations may have been mostly severed, [there are still
narrow openings for cooperation around issues that are seen as
essential.]{.underline} Lessons from History Despite the stark
challenges of reigniting full-fledged cooperation today, [the United
States and Russia have a long history of polar science cooperation and
diplomacy over common interests during times of geopolitical
confrontation. During the Cold War, American and Russian researchers
engaged in numerous scientific exchanges and joined dozens of countries
to study sea ice, aurora borealis and polar meteorology]{.underline} as
part of the 1957--58 International Geophysical Year. [In the 1970s, the
US and USSR signed landmark agreements on environmental protection and
polar bear conservation. [At the end of the Cold War, the cooperation
between Soviet and Western Arctic scientists built interstate trust and
spilled over into the political and military
spheres]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In a famous 1987 speech in
northern Russia, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev recognized that "[the
community and interrelationship of the interests of our entire world is
felt in the Arctic, perhaps more than anywhere else]{.underline}," and
that "scientific exploration of the Arctic is of immense importance for
the whole of mankind." Gorbachev's ruminations went on to inspire the
1996 formation of the Arctic Council. After the Cold War, [US-Russia
Arctic cooperation skyrocketed as Western researchers poured into the
previously inaccessible Russian Arctic.]{.underline} Notable
collaborations include the Russian-American Long-term Census of the
Arctic (RUSALCA, which means "mermaid" in Russian). Across several
expeditions to the Bering and Chukchi Seas between 2004 and 2015,
Russian and American scientists jointly studied marine chemistry,
glaciology, oceanography, and ecosystems. RUSALCA existed "as a
miracle," according to its participants, because of initial opposition
from Russian and American security services. The project continued
against the background of political tensions related to the 2008
Russo-Georgian War and 2014 Ukraine crisis. Such examples offer
practical examples for common-interest cooperation despite steep
political disagreements. Today, climate science has fallen victim to the
diplomatic fallout of the war in Ukraine. Nonetheless, [there remains
significant and ongoing support from international scientists and Arctic
residents for Moscow and Washington to find a common understanding in
studying and tackling the Arctic climate crisis.]{.underline}
[[Scientific cooperation, an essential endeavor for the world's
survival, can help build trust between the United States and Russia, and
prevent a conflict in a region that has not seen interstate violence
since World War II.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## Warming Alliances Turn Answers

### 2AC -- China-Russia Alliance Turn

#### China-Russia arctic alliance [fails]{.underline}.

With the Arctic finding itself under ever greater global scrutiny due to
climate change, and opening up to increased economic activities, from
shipping to mining to fishing, the question of whether great power
competition is spilling over into the far north has assumed greater
importance. [One aspect of this attention has been the idea of
a]{.underline} probable, and perhaps even inevitable, [**Arctic pact**
between **China** and **Russia**]{.underline}, one based on mutual
northern interests and shared mistrust of the West.

At first glance, there is much evidence to support this view, especially
with Beijing declining to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and
instead adopting a nebulous policy of neutrality toward the conflict.
China and Russia are both pushing back against what they perceive as
NATO militarism and expansionism in the Arctic. The Polar Silk Road,
which the two states began to jointly develop after 2017, was meant to
further enhance Sino-Russian boreal cooperation, centering on the
Northern Sea Route connecting Asia and Europe via the waters abutting
Siberia.

These points of collaboration are now more commonly viewed as signals
that a deeper Arctic pact is forming between the two powers. One recent
example is a report, published earlier this month by American
intelligence firm Strider Technologies, which argued that China is
rapidly increasing its economic presence in the Russian Arctic and that
Moscow has opened the door to Chinese interests in Siberia and Russia's
Far East. This would suggest the powers are now openly seeking to
counterbalance the West in the Arctic in light of NATO's expansion to
include Finland and likely Sweden. In short, there is the conclusion
that the Sino-Russian "no limits" partnership -- declared in February
2022, on the eve of the invasion of Ukraine -- is allegedly thriving in
the Arctic.

[[A **closer look** at]{.mark} the pattern of [Sino-Russian
**cooperation** in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past decade,
however, [[reveals]{.mark} much more
**[ambivalence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially on Beijing's part.
[[There are **concerns** with]{.mark}in both governments as to [each
other's]{.mark} future **[intentions]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Far from pursuing an "unlimited" partnership,
[[Beijing]{.mark} has instead **[selectively engaged]{.mark}**
Russia]{.underline} in the Arctic, in areas that reflect China's own
interests, such as increased science diplomacy, and has agreed to
purchase Russian oil and gas (at discounted rates).

As for overall shipping, [[Chinese firms have been **reluctant**]{.mark}
to use the Northern Sea Route since 2022 [due to]{.mark} concerns about
facing **Western [sanctions]{.mark}** for providing economic assistance
to Russia]{.underline}. Additionally, the Hong Kong-registered vessel
Newnew Polar Bear was placed under an uncomfortable spotlight after
being implicated in undersea cable cuts in the Gulf of Finland last
October.

China's stance on oil and gas development in the Russian Arctic has also
been sporadic, with Beijing remaining tepid on Russian interests in
co-developing the Power of Siberia 2 natural gas pipeline. Chinese
energy firms have made only infrequent protests over Western sanctions
on Russia.

The Strider report highlighted a considerable uptick in Chinese firms
registering to operate in the Russian Arctic as a sign of [deepening
bilateral [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region. Yet this
leads to the question of whether these figures
[[reflect]{.underline}]{.mark} an immanent increase in joint
China-backed Russian Arctic projects, or [[merely a **window of
opportunity**]{.mark} for Chinese interests to jockey for
position]{.underline}, given the spaces vacated by European firms
decamping from Russian partnerships. What remains to be seen is whether
the potential impact of the growing number of Chinese companies in the
Arctic will represent any significant economic power shift, given
ongoing Russian sensitivity to the economic sovereignty of its Arctic
lands, and the uneven track record of previous joint Polar Silk Road
projects in Siberia.

One notable example is the long-planned Belkomur rail link in western
Siberia, which was touted as a potential Sino-Russian investment in a
vital land link for Eurasian trade. The project remains in bureaucratic
limbo, with ongoing questions about its economic viability.

Moreover, China originally perceived the Polar Silk Road as eventually
linking Chinese interests with the whole of the Arctic, with plans
ranging from mining in Canada and Greenland, to rail links in the Nordic
region, to natural gas development in Alaska. [**[Few]{.mark}** of these
[projects are **likely**]{.mark} to move forward]{.underline}. Now
Beijing must deal with Russia as its only viable economic outlet to the
Far North, a situation the Chinese government did not anticipate when
the Polar Silk Road was first established.

Much [discussion of closer Sino-Russian Arctic ties ignores the fact
that [Moscow is seeking to]{.mark} further **[diversify]{.mark}** its
Arctic partners [**beyond** China]{.mark}]{.underline}, by including
India and countries in the Gulf Region. With Russian participation in
the Arctic Council reduced since March 2022, [Moscow has made **little
secre**t of its interest in looking for **additional** Arctic partners
**elsewhere**]{.underline}.

Last year, Russia called for a BRICS science station to be established
in Pyramiden, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago, which would allow not
only China but also other members of the group such as Brazil and India
to participate. This came at a time when the BRICS are in the process of
expanding their membership, with countries such as Egypt, Iran, and the
United Arab Emirates already signed on (and the UAE has recently given
many indications that it is seeking to expand its own Arctic interests).
While China will remain an integral player in Moscow's Arctic planning,
it is evident that [the Russian government is **counting on** the
creation of a wider **alternative** Arctic regime.]{.underline}

Despite lofty declarations of mutual interests in the Arctic, [[there
have been **significant cracks**]{.mark} in this regional
relationship]{.underline}. These include [ongoing [concerns about
**demographic stresses**]{.mark} between Russia's depopulated Arctic
territories]{.underline} and adjacent Chinese provinces. In addition, in
2020 [a Russian Arctic [researcher]{.mark} was [accused of
**spying**]{.mark}]{.underline} for Beijing, [[and]{.mark} overall there
has been **[little]{.mark} movement** [beyond **rhetoric**]{.mark} on
further joint research]{.underline} initiatives between the two states.

Another telling sign of trouble was the release of an official standard
Chinese map in August last year, which designated an island shared by
the two powers, Bolshoi Ussuriysky (Heixiazi Island in Chinese), as
wholly belonging to China. The Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources had
also decreed in February 2023 that its own maps of the Russian Far East
be changed to use traditional Chinese names of Russian cities like
Vladivostok. [These moves **must** also **be considered** when
discussing the robustness of Sino-Russian Arctic
cooperation.]{.underline}

[The **underlying question** is whether there is]{.underline} a
threshold degree of [**trust** between China and Russia to allow for a
**deepening** of Arctic **cooperation**]{.underline}. Both countries
have engaged in joint military operations in and near the Arctic, such
as off the coast of Alaska in August of last year, but [[it remains
**unclear**]{.mark} as to [whether]{.mark} these [displays]{.mark} have
[served **any purpose** beyond a **show**]{.mark} of unity versus the
West. The signing of a **bilateral** coast guard
**agreement**]{.underline} in Murmansk, near the Finnish border, [was
**symbolic**]{.underline}, but there has been little sign that Russia
will significantly yield its coveted Arctic maritime space to Chinese
vessels.

The **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**n government [[remains
**concerned** about China's]{.mark} longer-term [goals]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}, especially as the power gap between the two states
continues to widen. [[Beijing **worries** about]{.mark} being too
dependent upon [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially since the future
of that country remains cloudy, at best. [[The]{.mark} 1969 Sino-Soviet

While the far-northern strategies of Beijing and Moscow need to be
carefully analyzed, presuming that the two states are in lockstep with
their regional policies creates a distorted strategic picture at a time
when clarity about Arctic security is desperately needed.

[**Distancing** China and Russia in the]{.underline} Context of the
**[Arctic]{.underline}**

The loss of the Arctic Council, at least temporarily, as a venue for
collaboration and coordination will almost certainly stifle the variety
of environmental and scientific exploration efforts that were finally
underway after the Trump administration spent years awkwardly avoiding
the term "climate change." But it may also provide an opportunity for
the West to distance Russia and China, while reaffirming the value of
Arctic cooperation and sustainable investment.

The concept of an "Arctic Council 2.0," reinvented to tackle the dilemma
of having the largest Arctic state being an international pariah, is
likely to gain support among non-Arctic states who have a deep interest
in Arctic governance. Under this potential new construct, decisions
would not be made by consensus, but rather by a majority of interested
states. It's possible that non-Arctic countries such as China, Japan,
South Korea, and Singapore --- which have growing Arctic interests and
have contributed much to Arctic research --- would welcome the
opportunity for them to establish a more solid role in this region's
affairs. The risks to this approach are obvious, as it would
fundamentally undermine the concept of Arctic governance being the
exclusive prerogative of Arctic states.

However, at least the United States does not see the "Arctic Council
2.0" as a serious proposal on the table for reformatting or replacing
the Arctic Council. As James P. DeHart, U.S. Coordinator for the Arctic
Region at the State Department, recently noted, "One thing that has not
changed is our commitment to the Council as the premier forum for the
Arctic region, as a circum-Polar forum."

This then leaves open the question of how the [western **[Arctic
states]{.mark}**]{.underline}, individually and collectively,
[[will]{.mark} respond to the new reality in the Arctic and]{.underline}
how they can possibly [leverage it to [**distance China** from
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Polar Silk Road does not just run
through Russia. It is a broad effort by Beijing to invest across the
Arctic and relies heavily on European nations as target markets. This
may provide the western Arctic countries with some leverage to shape
China's cost-benefit calculation regarding its Arctic interests.

Norway, a founding NATO ally, will undoubtedly uphold the sanctions
regime and ensure solidarity with NATO and E.U. partners, but it also
needs to maintain its relations with Russia and China. Norway's role as
NATO's "listening post" on the alliance's northern flank makes Norway
most vulnerable when relations with Russia deteriorate. Its shared land
and maritime border with Russia make dialogue with Moscow essential. On
the other hand, Oslo's ties with Beijing used to be difficult following
a kerfuffle over the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 but have normalized since
2016. The two countries are striving to conclude a bilateral free-trade
agreement that could provide China with further access to European
markets and Norway's significant offshore hydrocarbon deposits that can
be developed to compensate for some of the loss of access to the Russian
Arctic. [[Norway is]{.mark} also [**strongly courting** Chinese
investment]{.mark} throughout their Arctic region [and it is
**unlikely**]{.mark} that [China would **tolerate high
tensions**]{.mark} along the western terminus of the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline} in the very area that links the route with the
European market. Moreover, [[Norway's **control** over]{.mark} the
important Arctic outpost in [the **Svalbard**]{.mark} Islands [gives it
a unique leverage]{.mark} with treaty signatories Russia and
China]{.underline}, by providing them guaranteed access for economic and
scientific purposes. [Norway's **unique position**]{.underline}
vis-à-vis China and Russia could [make it a new kind of listening post
for **Western allies**]{.underline} as they navigate the new dynamics in
the Arctic.

[[Finland and Sweden]{.underline}]{.mark}, currently non-NATO Arctic
states, have begun reconsidering their stance on the alliance. Should
they [[join NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, shifting the Arctic state balance
from five NATO members to seven would [[send a **strong signal**]{.mark}
to **Moscow** [on the **feasibility** of]{.mark} future Arctic
**[cooperation]{.mark}** as well as to Beijing on the sustainability of
its omnidirectional Arctic diplomacy]{.underline}. It may also embolden
NATO as a new forum for Arctic cooperation and increase non-Arctic NATO
members' interest in Arctic matters. In the long run, this may lead to a
more militaristic view of Arctic cooperation and one that bodes ill for
climate and economic cooperation. [[For China]{.underline}]{.mark},
having been declared a strategic challenge for NATO, [an [enhanced
**NATO**]{.mark} presence throughout the Arctic [would **not** be in its
**interest**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Canada has historically had hesitation about a robust role for NATO in
the North American Arctic and has long championed pan-Arctic non-defense
cooperation. It is, however, likely to remain in complete lockstep with
Washington and Europe on Russian sanctions, clearing the way for NATO to
pursue a wider role in the High North. Canada also holds out hope that
the Northwest Passage may provide a viable route for future shipping
between the Pacific and Europe, offering an alternative to the
Russia-controlled Northern Sea Route. The near-term viability of the
Northwest Passage as a safe, economical route for major shipping
activity remains in question, however, and Russia has invested much more
in the development of the Northern Sea Route, which also benefits from
uneven ice melt that frees its sea lanes much more than the Canadian
alternative. But with the second longest shoreline in the Arctic,
[[Canada's **sea routes** retain]{.mark} a future [potential for the
Polar Silk Road]{.mark}'s maritime trade [that China **cannot
ignore**]{.mark}.]{.underline} China has invested in Canadian industry,
especially minerals, but the investments have decreased as U.S. warnings
on so-called Chinese gray-zone activities using Arctic investment
influence have caused more scrutiny. Tensions over Canada's arrest of
Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and China's reciprocal detention of
Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig have also added to
Canadian wariness of Chinese motives. Despite this, [[there
remains]{.mark} a [**strong desire** from Canada for foreign
**investment** in the **Arctic**]{.mark} region and some tribal
communities do believe that Chinese investment is "too great to pass
up."]{.underline}

Arctic ice cap is expected to disappear in summertime and to shrink

Arctic Circle; vast reserves of iron ore, uranium, and rare earth
minerals are also thought to be buried there. These [[**resources**,

Of particular relevance to GCR is the effect of climate change on the
risk of nuclear war (Parthemore, Femia, & Werrell, 2018). However, to
our knowledge, this has never been rigorously assessed, although the
potential is certainly there. One recent model of the risk of nuclear
war highlighted how varied, and common, incidents with the potential to
trigger a nuclear exchange are (Baum, de Neufville, & Barrett, 2018). It
outlined 14 different causal pathways to an exchange, including the
escalation of conventional wars and international crises, human error,
and the emergence of new non-state actors. For all but two of these,
they identify historical examples of potentially precipitating
incidents, with 60 incidents in total (i.e. a little less than one a
year). This suggests that [[the **absence** of nuclear war was **less
due** to a **lack of**]{.mark} **potential [causes]{.mark}**[, than
the]{.mark} global **political [system's]{.mark}** [ability to **defuse
them**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [the **real significance** of
[climate change may]{.mark} be its **capacity** to [**undermine** this
system: the combination of]{.mark} social, **[political]{.mark}**, [and
**environmental disruption**]{.mark}, a [lingering]{.mark} sense of
[global **injustice**, and rising **food**]{.mark}, water, [and **energy
insecurity**]{.mark} could [increase the probability]{.mark} that
[crises **escalate**]{.mark}]{.underline} or that false alarms are
mistaken for genuine emergencies. This topic needs further research.

3.3. The emergence of a global systems death spiral

Yet, we should not conclude that a nuclear exchange is the only, or even
most likely, scenario in which political instability might produce a
global catastrophe. [Conflict and political instability]{.underline},
even of moderate severity, [are themselves two of the most **significant
drivers** of **biodiversity loss**]{.underline} due to breakdowns in
monitoring, governance, and (public and private) property rights
(Baynham-Herd, Amano, Sutherland, & Donald, 2018). This closes a
potentially reinforcing feedback loop between loss of biosphere
integrity, food insecurity and political breakdown.

The mechanisms by which these cascading failures might spread include
many of the natural, anthropogenic, and replicator effects identified by
Avin et al. (2018), making them harder to contain. At the natural level,
climate change involves changes to the global atmospheric and
biogeochemical systems and poses other naturally spreading harms, like
global ecological collapse. At the anthropogenic level, the global
interconnectedness of sociotechnological systems means that while small
shocks are easier to recover from, larger shocks can be harder to
contain and control. Finally, biological and informational replication
can also spread the negative impacts of climate change, from
vector-borne diseases and invasive species to climate fatalism and
dangerous geoengineering technologies.

Given these numerous spread mechanisms, [[critical system
failures]{.mark} could **[precipitate]{.mark}** global
**[catastrophes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore, the spiral we have
explored is unlikely to be the only set of interlinked systemic
disruptions [[that climate change could
**initiate**]{.underline}]{.mark} (other death spirals could involve
bio-insecurity and disease), nor are these the only causal connections
between these three systems. Until we understand the nature of such
death spirals better, we must act cautiously. We now turn to consider
what this would mean.

#### Warming induced [scarcities]{.underline} escalate every [nuclear dyad]{.underline}.

**Klare 20** \[Michael Klare (Five Colleges professor emeritus, peace

Likelihood of Nuclear War,\" The Nation,

[[Climbing]{.mark} world **[temperatures]{.mark}** and rising sea levels
will [**diminish** the supply of **food and water**]{.mark} in many
resource-deprived areas]{.underline}, increasing the risk of widespread
starvation, social unrest, and human flight. [Global **corn
production**, for example, is projected to fall by as much as **14
percent**]{.underline} in a 2°C warmer world, according to research
cited in a 2018 special report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). [Food scarcity and crop failures risk pushing
hundreds of millions of people into overcrowded cities]{.underline},
where the likelihood of pandemics, ethnic strife, and severe storm
damage is bound to increase. All of this will impose an immense burden
on human institutions. Some states may collapse or break up into a
collection of warring chiefdoms---all fighting over sources of water and
other vital resources.

A similar momentum is now evident in the emerging nuclear arms race,
with all three major powers---China, Russia, and the United
States---rushing to deploy a host of new munitions. This dangerous
process commenced a decade ago, when Russian and Chinese leaders sought
improvements to their nuclear arsenals and President Barack Obama, in
order to secure Senate approval of the New Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty of 2010, agreed to initial funding for the modernization of all
three legs of America's strategic triad, which encompasses submarines,
intercontinental ballistic missiles, and bombers. (New START, which
mandated significant reductions in US and Russian arsenals, will expire
in February 2021 unless renewed by the two countries.) Although Obama
initiated the modernization of the nuclear triad, the Trump
administration has sought funds to proceed with their full-scale
production, at an estimated initial installment of \$500 billion over 10
years.

Even during the initial modernization program of the Obama era, Russian
and Chinese leaders were sufficiently alarmed to hasten their own
nuclear acquisitions. Both countries were already in the process of
modernizing their stockpiles---Russia to replace Cold War--era systems
that had become unreliable, China to provide its relatively small
arsenal with enhanced capabilities. Trump's decision to acquire a whole
new suite of ICBMs, nuclear-armed submarines, and bombers has added
momentum to these efforts. And with all three major powers upgrading
their arsenals, the other nuclear-weapon states---led by India,
Pakistan, and North Korea---have been expanding their stockpiles as
well. Moreover, with Trump's recent decision to abandon the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, all major powers are
developing missile delivery systems for a regional nuclear war such as
might erupt in Europe, South Asia, or the western Pacific.

All things being equal, [[rising **temperatures**]{.mark} will
[increase]{.mark} the [**likelihood** of **nuclear war**]{.mark},
largely [because **climate change**]{.mark} will [heighten]{.mark} the
risk of [**social stress**, the **decay** of]{.mark} nation-[states, and
**armed violence**]{.mark} in general]{.underline}, as I argue in my new
book, All Hell Breaking Loose. As food and water supplies dwindle and
governments come under ever-increasing pressure to meet the vital needs
of their populations, [disputes over critical resources are likely to
become more heated and violent]{.underline}, whether the parties
involved have nuclear arms or not. But this danger is compounded by the
possibility that several nuclear-armed powers---notably [[**India**,
**Pakistan**, and **China**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[will **break
apart** as a **result**]{.mark} of climate change]{.underline} and
accompanying battles over disputed supplies of water.

Together, these three countries are projected by the UN Population
Division to number approximately 3.4 billion people in 2050, or 34
percent of the world's population. Yet they possess a much smaller share
of the world's freshwater supplies, and climate change is destined to
reduce what they have even further. Warmer temperatures are also
expected to diminish crop yields in these countries, adding to the
desperation of farmers and very likely resulting in widespread ethnic
strife and population displacement. Under these circumstances,
[[climate]{.mark}-related internal [turmoil]{.mark} would
[increase]{.mark} the risk of **[nuclear war]{.mark}** in two ways: [by
enabling]{.mark} the [**capture** of nuclear arms by **rogue**]{.mark}
elements of the **[military]{.mark}**]{.underline} and their possible
use against perceived enemies [[and]{.mark} by **[inciting
wars]{.mark}** between these states [over]{.mark} vital supplies of
water and other critical **[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The risk to Pakistan from climate change is thought to be particularly
acute. A large part of the population is still engaged in agriculture,
and much of the best land---along with access to water---is controlled
by wealthy landowners (who also dominate national politics). Water
scarcity and mismanagement is a perennial challenge, and climate change
is bound to make the problem worse. Climate and Social Stress:
Implications for Security Analysis, a 2013 report by the National
Research Council for the US intelligence community, highlights the
danger of chaos and conflict in that country as global warming advances.
Pakistan, the report notes, is expected to suffer from inadequate water
supplies during the dry season and severe flooding during the
monsoon---outcomes that will devastate its agriculture and amplify the
poverty and unrest already afflicting much of the country. "The Pakistan
case," the report reads, "illustrates how a highly stressed
environmental system on which a tense society depends can be a source of
political instability and how that source can intensify when climate
events put increased stress on the system." Thus, as global temperatures
rise and agriculture declines, Pakistan could shatter along ethnic,
class, and religious lines, precisely the scenario that might trigger
the sort of intervention anticipated by the US Joint Special Operations
Command.

Assuming that Pakistan remains intact, another great danger arising from
increasing world temperatures is a conflict between it and India or
between China and India over access to shared river systems. Whatever
their differences, Pakistan and western India are forced by geography to
share a single river system, the Indus, for much of their water
requirements. Likewise, western China and eastern India also share a
river, the Brahmaputra, for their vital water needs. The Indus and the
Brahmaputra obtain much of their flow from periods of heavy
precipitation; they also depend on meltwater from Himalayan glaciers,
and these are at risk of melting because of rising temperatures.
According to the IPCC, the Himalayan glaciers could lose as much as 29
percent of their total mass by 2035 and 78 percent by 2100. This would
produce periodic flooding as the ice melts but would eventually result
in long periods of negligible flow, with calamitous consequences for
downstream agriculture. The widespread starvation and chaos that could
result would prove daunting to all the governments involved and make any
water-related disputes between them a potential flash point for
escalation.

As in Pakistan, water supply has always played a pivotal role in the
social and economic life of China and India, with both countries highly
dependent on a few major river systems for civic and agricultural
purposes. Excessive rainfall can lead to catastrophic flooding, and
prolonged drought has often led to widespread famine and mass
starvation. In such a setting, water management has always been a prime
responsibility of government---and a failure to fulfill this function
effectively has often resulted in civil unrest. Climate change is bound
to increase this danger by causing prolonged water shortages
interspersed with severe flooding. This has prompted leaders of both
countries to build ever more dams on all key rivers.

[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the upstream power on several
tributaries of the Indus, [[and China]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the
upstream power on the Brahmaputra, have [[considered **damming**]{.mark}
**these [rivers]{.mark}** and diverting their waters for **exclusive
national use**]{.underline}, thereby diminishing the flow to downstream
users. Three of the Indus's principal tributaries, the Jhelum, Chenab,
and Ravi rivers, flow through Indian-controlled Kashmir (now in total
lockdown, with government forces suppressing all public functions). It's
possible that India seeks full control of Kashmir in order to dam the
tributaries there and divert their waters from Pakistan---[a move [that
could **easily trigger** a war]{.mark} if it occurs at a time of severe
food and water stress [and]{.mark} one that would very likely
[invite]{.mark} the [use of **nuclear weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline},
given Pakistan's attitude toward them.

The situation regarding the Brahmaputra could prove equally precarious.
China has already installed one dam on the river, the Zangmu Dam in
Tibet, and has announced plans for several more. Some Chinese
hydrologists have proposed the construction of canals linking the
Brahmaputra to more northerly rivers in China, allowing the diversion of
its waters to drought-stricken areas of the heavily populated northeast.
These plans have yet to come to fruition, but as global warming
increases water scarcity across northern China, Beijing might proceed
with the idea. "If China was determined to move forward with such a
scheme," the US National Intelligence Council warned in 2009, "it could
become a major element in pushing China and India towards an adversarial
rather than simply a competitive relationship."

### 1AR -- Alliance Fails

#### China-Russia arctic alliance [fails]{.underline}.

**Lanteigne 24** \[Marc Lanteigne (Professor of Political Science, The
Arctic University of Norway; adjunct lecturer, University of Greenland),
2-21-24, "A China-Russia Arctic Alliance? Not So Fast." The Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2024/02/a-china-russia-arctic-alliance-not-so-fast/,
njn, accessed 6-27-2025\]

With the Arctic finding itself under ever greater global scrutiny due to
climate change, and opening up to increased economic activities, from
shipping to mining to fishing, the question of whether great power
competition is spilling over into the far north has assumed greater
importance. [One aspect of this attention has been the idea of
a]{.underline} probable, and perhaps even inevitable, [**Arctic pact**
between **China** and **Russia**]{.underline}, one based on mutual
northern interests and shared mistrust of the West.

At first glance, there is much evidence to support this view, especially
with Beijing declining to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and
instead adopting a nebulous policy of neutrality toward the conflict.
China and Russia are both pushing back against what they perceive as
NATO militarism and expansionism in the Arctic. The Polar Silk Road,
which the two states began to jointly develop after 2017, was meant to
further enhance Sino-Russian boreal cooperation, centering on the
Northern Sea Route connecting Asia and Europe via the waters abutting
Siberia.

These points of collaboration are now more commonly viewed as signals
that a deeper Arctic pact is forming between the two powers. One recent
example is a report, published earlier this month by American
intelligence firm Strider Technologies, which argued that China is
rapidly increasing its economic presence in the Russian Arctic and that
Moscow has opened the door to Chinese interests in Siberia and Russia's
Far East. This would suggest the powers are now openly seeking to
counterbalance the West in the Arctic in light of NATO's expansion to
include Finland and likely Sweden. In short, there is the conclusion
that the Sino-Russian "no limits" partnership -- declared in February
2022, on the eve of the invasion of Ukraine -- is allegedly thriving in
the Arctic.

[[A **closer look** at]{.mark} the pattern of [Sino-Russian
**cooperation** in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past decade,
however, [[reveals]{.mark} much more
**[ambivalence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially on Beijing's part.
[[There are **concerns** with]{.mark}in both governments as to [each
other's]{.mark} future **[intentions]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Far from pursuing an "unlimited" partnership,
[[Beijing]{.mark} has instead **[selectively engaged]{.mark}**
Russia]{.underline} in the Arctic, in areas that reflect China's own
interests, such as increased science diplomacy, and has agreed to
purchase Russian oil and gas (at discounted rates).

As for overall shipping, [[Chinese firms have been **reluctant**]{.mark}
to use the Northern Sea Route since 2022 [due to]{.mark} concerns about
facing **Western [sanctions]{.mark}** for providing economic assistance
to Russia]{.underline}. Additionally, the Hong Kong-registered vessel
Newnew Polar Bear was placed under an uncomfortable spotlight after
being implicated in undersea cable cuts in the Gulf of Finland last
October.

China's stance on oil and gas development in the Russian Arctic has also
been sporadic, with Beijing remaining tepid on Russian interests in
co-developing the Power of Siberia 2 natural gas pipeline. Chinese
energy firms have made only infrequent protests over Western sanctions
on Russia.

The Strider report highlighted a considerable uptick in Chinese firms
registering to operate in the Russian Arctic as a sign of [deepening
bilateral [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region. Yet this
leads to the question of whether these figures
[[reflect]{.underline}]{.mark} an immanent increase in joint
China-backed Russian Arctic projects, or [[merely a **window of
opportunity**]{.mark} for Chinese interests to jockey for
position]{.underline}, given the spaces vacated by European firms
decamping from Russian partnerships. What remains to be seen is whether
the potential impact of the growing number of Chinese companies in the
Arctic will represent any significant economic power shift, given
ongoing Russian sensitivity to the economic sovereignty of its Arctic
lands, and the uneven track record of previous joint Polar Silk Road
projects in Siberia.

One notable example is the long-planned Belkomur rail link in western
Siberia, which was touted as a potential Sino-Russian investment in a
vital land link for Eurasian trade. The project remains in bureaucratic
limbo, with ongoing questions about its economic viability.

Moreover, China originally perceived the Polar Silk Road as eventually
linking Chinese interests with the whole of the Arctic, with plans
ranging from mining in Canada and Greenland, to rail links in the Nordic
region, to natural gas development in Alaska. [**[Few]{.mark}** of these
[projects are **likely**]{.mark} to move forward]{.underline}. Now
Beijing must deal with Russia as its only viable economic outlet to the
Far North, a situation the Chinese government did not anticipate when
the Polar Silk Road was first established.

Much [discussion of closer Sino-Russian Arctic ties ignores the fact
that [Moscow is seeking to]{.mark} further **[diversify]{.mark}** its
Arctic partners [**beyond** China]{.mark}]{.underline}, by including
India and countries in the Gulf Region. With Russian participation in
the Arctic Council reduced since March 2022, [Moscow has made **little
secre**t of its interest in looking for **additional** Arctic partners
**elsewhere**]{.underline}.

Last year, Russia called for a BRICS science station to be established
in Pyramiden, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago, which would allow not
only China but also other members of the group such as Brazil and India
to participate. This came at a time when the BRICS are in the process of
expanding their membership, with countries such as Egypt, Iran, and the
United Arab Emirates already signed on (and the UAE has recently given
many indications that it is seeking to expand its own Arctic interests).
While China will remain an integral player in Moscow's Arctic planning,
it is evident that [the Russian government is **counting on** the
creation of a wider **alternative** Arctic regime.]{.underline}

Despite lofty declarations of mutual interests in the Arctic, [[there
have been **significant cracks**]{.mark} in this regional
relationship]{.underline}. These include [ongoing [concerns about
**demographic stresses**]{.mark} between Russia's depopulated Arctic
territories]{.underline} and adjacent Chinese provinces. In addition, in
2020 [a Russian Arctic [researcher]{.mark} was [accused of
**spying**]{.mark}]{.underline} for Beijing, [[and]{.mark} overall there
has been **[little]{.mark} movement** [beyond **rhetoric**]{.mark} on
further joint research]{.underline} initiatives between the two states.

Another telling sign of trouble was the release of an official standard
Chinese map in August last year, which designated an island shared by
the two powers, Bolshoi Ussuriysky (Heixiazi Island in Chinese), as
wholly belonging to China. The Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources had
also decreed in February 2023 that its own maps of the Russian Far East
be changed to use traditional Chinese names of Russian cities like
Vladivostok. [These moves **must** also **be considered** when
discussing the robustness of Sino-Russian Arctic
cooperation.]{.underline}

[The **underlying question** is whether there is]{.underline} a
threshold degree of [**trust** between China and Russia to allow for a
**deepening** of Arctic **cooperation**]{.underline}. Both countries
have engaged in joint military operations in and near the Arctic, such
as off the coast of Alaska in August of last year, but [[it remains
**unclear**]{.mark} as to [whether]{.mark} these [displays]{.mark} have
[served **any purpose** beyond a **show**]{.mark} of unity versus the
West. The signing of a **bilateral** coast guard
**agreement**]{.underline} in Murmansk, near the Finnish border, [was
**symbolic**]{.underline}, but there has been little sign that Russia
will significantly yield its coveted Arctic maritime space to Chinese
vessels.

The **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**n government [[remains
**concerned** about China's]{.mark} longer-term [goals]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}, especially as the power gap between the two states
continues to widen. [[Beijing **worries** about]{.mark} being too
dependent upon [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially since the future
of that country remains cloudy, at best. [[The]{.mark} 1969 Sino-Soviet
[border war has]{.mark} likely [**not** been **forgotten**]{.mark} by
either power, and remains a **cautionary tale**]{.underline} for both
states about the dangers of, to use the Maoist-era phrase, "leaning to
one side" too much.

While the far-northern strategies of Beijing and Moscow need to be
carefully analyzed, presuming that the two states are in lockstep with
their regional policies creates a distorted strategic picture at a time
when clarity about Arctic security is desperately needed.

[[On]{.mark} the [face]{.mark} of things, Sino-Russian [relations have
**never been better**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At their Beijing summit in
February 2022, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin announced a "friendship
without limits." There were "no forbidden areas" of cooperation, and the
Sino-Russian strategic partnership was "superior" even to the alliances
of the Cold War era.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine appears to confirm the strength of these
bonds. Notwithstanding protestations of neutrality, Beijing has fallen
in line with the Kremlin's narrative of a "special military operation."
It has accused the West of "provoking" Russia. Its much-vaunted
commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states has
been invisible. And it has ignored abundant evidence of Russian war
crimes. It would be natural in the circumstances to see China as
complicit in Putin's war, especially as the invasion began only days
after the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics.

[[Yet appearances are **deceptive**. The **Chinese response** to Putin's
war]{.mark} has [shown]{.mark} that there are **[real limits]{.mark}**
to their supposedly "no limits" friendship.]{.underline} And
[[**fundamental questions** have been **raised** over the
future]{.underline}]{.mark} direction and character [of the Sino-Russian
**[partnership]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Moscow's hall pass

Putin most likely gave Xi prior notice of Russia's invasion. Not to have
done so would have demonstrated an unforgivable lack of trust and
contradicted the warm sentiments expressed at the summit three weeks
earlier.

However, [[there is **no evidence**]{.mark} that [Putin **briefed
Xi**]{.mark} in detail. [The **failure** of the Chinese government
to]{.mark}]{.underline} make provision for
**[[evacuat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [some [6,000 **nationals** from
Ukraine]{.mark},]{.underline} and its chaotic public affairs response in
the first days of the invasion, [[suggests]{.mark} that [it was **caught
on the hop**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

One explanation for Beijing's unpreparedness may be that Putin told Xi
that the "special military operation" would be over quickly. The
Ukrainians would not offer serious resistance, while the Western
response would be as ineffectual as it had been in 2014, when Russia
annexed Crimea and occupied parts of the Donbas. There would be a new
reality that everyone would have to accept, whatever their feelings.

The Chinese president may or may not have believed Putin. But, in any
case, the question is moot. For Beijing and Moscow, foreign policy is a
sovereign affair --- and especially when it concerns core or vital
interests. Just as Xi would hardly seek Putin's opinion about how to
manage the issue of Taiwan, so he would not expect to influence Russian
decision-making on Ukraine.

Had the war proceeded according to Putin's expectations, Beijing might
well have emerged as a beneficiary. China would no longer have been
public enemy number one in Washington. The Europeans would have been too
distracted to offer meaningful support to America in the Indo-Pacific.
The Biden administration would have been further humiliated, following
the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. And the very notion of a
U.S.-led international order would have lacked credibility.

Except things turned out very differently. From Beijing's perspective,
the war has gone about as badly as it could have gone. The Russian
military has performed abysmally. Putin, Xi's "best friend," has been
exposed as barbaric and inept. Western unity is stronger than in two
decades. America has shown that it is willing and able to lead.

What's more, [[China has been **tainted** by association]{.mark} with an
international delinquent. [Russian **actions**]{.mark} have
[**squeezed** Beijing's **options** on Taiwan, while]{.mark} the
[**knock-on** effects on]{.mark} the global
**[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- including soaring energy and food

The [IAEA Assessment of **Iran's Nuke Program**]{.underline}

Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, discussed the state of Iran's nuclear program on Sunday
on CBS News' Face the Nation; the interview was taped Friday:

I think you can pick and choose any adjective to characterize this, but
you will see that [[there is an **agreement**]{.mark} in describing this
as a very serious level of damage]{.underline}. It can be, you know,
described in different ways, but [it's clear [that]{.mark} what happened
in particular in Fordo, Natanz, Isfahan]{.underline}, where
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} used to have and still has, to some degree,
[[capabilities in]{.mark} terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment
of [**uranium** have been **destroyed**]{.mark}]{.underline} to an
important degree. Some is still standing. So there is, of course, an
important setback in terms of those --- of those capabilities. This is
--- this is clear. And now the important issue --- the important thing
is, what are the next steps? Now the characterization of the damage, I
think we can, you know, speculate, and still, until, of course, the
Iranians themselves will have to go there and sift through the, you
know, rubble and look at what is the exact degree of the damage. At some
point, the IAEA will have to return. Although our job is not to assess
damage, but to re-establish the knowledge of the activities that take
place there, and the access to the material, which is very, very
important, the material that they will be producing if they continue
with this activity. This is contingent on other, you see, everything is
connected. This is --- this is contingent on negotiations which may or
may not restart, so --- so what we see this here, I think we have a
snapshot of- of- of a program which has been very seriously damaged, to
quote Dr. Araghchi. And now what we need to focus on is on the next
steps. \[Emphasis added.\]

"Dr. Araghchi" is Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister:

[Iran's foreign minister]{.underline}, Abbas Araghchi, [said on Thursday
that the country's nuclear facilities had sustained "significant and
serious damages,"]{.underline} the first official acknowledgment of the
extent of the damages caused by U.S. strikes on three nuclear sites.

The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran was still "surveilling the
damages and losses," Mr. Araghchi said in an interview with Iran's state
television. But, he added, "I have to say, [the losses have not been
small, and our [facilities have been **seriously
damaged**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Is Iran's nuclear weapons program so destroyed that we never have to
worry about it again? No. Iran has more than 90 million people, two
uranium mines, and depending upon how you measure, either the 25th or
the 37th-largest economy in the world. [If they pour **all their
resources** into developing a nuclear weapon, they can regain lost
ground.]{.underline} Of course, [[developing a]{.mark} nuclear [weapon

For Now, It's the Economy

Ascertaining Kim's intent is difficult, but North Korea is not the
"black hole" some describe it to be. For the past several years, Kim has
used major Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) meetings, particularly in the
final days of the year, to present reports or speeches that summarize
advances across political, ideological, economic, national defense,
diplomacy, and inter-Korean relations sectors over the past year,
describe the environment and challenges that North Korea faces, and lay
out goals and priorities for the coming year. Such reports should be
taken with a grain of salt: there is no way of verifying claims of
accomplishments, prioritization of goals, or precise details of the
various objectives. That said, such documents serve as guidelines or
"commander's intent" for North Koreans across all sectors of society,
and are often reinforced with various rallies, study sessions, project
launches, resource and personnel movements, and other efforts.

Two recent significant political meetings---the 9th Expanded Plenum of
the WPK Central Committee 8th Party Congress in late December 2023 and
the 19th Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the 8th Central
Committee of the WPK in January 2024---provided opportunities for Kim to
articulate his policies for the near term, with a focus on economic
development. While [[Kim]{.underline}]{.mark} admitted that the road
ahead would be difficult, he [[made a]{.mark}n impassioned [call for
**maximum** state]{.mark} and party **[efforts]{.mark}** to be directed
[toward]{.mark} improving **[economic conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}
throughout the country. Reports of discharged soldiers being sent to the
countryside, and the KPA doing its part to contribute to national
development, reflect the fact that [[North Korea is **not**]{.mark} a
country [**mobilizing** for **imminent war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[That said, Kim troublingly continues to **prioritize** advancement of
his **WMD program**]{.underline}. More launches and testing will come in
2024, as seen in North Korea's claimed test of a "new solid-fuel
hypersonic missile with intermediate range" on January 15 and test of a
"new-type strategic cruise missile" on January 24. The KPA's winter
training cycle will overlap with the upcoming U.S.-South Korea annual
military exercises, providing an environment conducive to North Korea to
ratchet up pressure and tension to support its standing disinformation
messaging efforts to portray the United States and South Korea as
culprits. It is impossible to rule out heightened rhetoric, bombastic
proclamations and threats, shows of force, challenges to the Northern
Limit Line that has served to separate maritime activities of the two
sides in the West Sea, and perhaps even a lethal provocation of limited
scale designed to foment criticism of North Korea policies in both Seoul
and Washington. [As regrettable as such [coercive behavior is]{.mark},
it is likely to be [**limited** in scope]{.mark}, with sufficient
de-escalation built in: [**all-out war** seems to be the **last thing**
Kim seeks]{.mark} at this time.]{.underline}

### 1AR -- AT: Tech Competition

#### No emerging tech impact\-\--everything is overhyped and application is dubious.

Security Team, Center for Security Studies), 4-1-2022, "2. Hypersonic
Weapons: Emerging, Disruptive, Political" in *Strategic Trends 2022: Key
Developments in Global Affairs*, pp. 43-68, Center for Security Studies,
njn\]

More Hype, Less Sonic

The idea of flying at hypersonic speeds has been around for some time.
Although the theoretical foundations were laid down in the 1960s, the
lack of suitable manufacturing processes hindered the development of
hyper- sonic systems. In addition, air-breath- ing engines for space
shuttles were judged too heavy and costly. Today, spurred by great-power
rivalry, recent scientific advances have brought these systems within
reach, as they have allowed prototypes to be construct- ed and tested.
This has sparked hype and impatience among trendspotters about whether
hypersonic technology will unleash a new industrial and/or military
revolution.

The hype is not unique to hyper- sonic weapons. The phenomenon of
[**[emerging]{.mark}** and disruptive
**[tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline} (EDTs) [[is **plagued**
with]{.mark} a [lack of **understanding** of the time it takes]{.mark}
for a given technology [to mature]{.mark}]{.underline}, innovation and
**[[adopt]{.underline}]{.mark}**ion challenges, [[and]{.mark} its
[**real-world** effects]{.mark}]{.underline} in both the short and long
runs. According to a 2020 NATO Science and Technology Organization
report, the EDTs include data, AI, autonomy, space, hypersonics, quantum
technologies, biotechnology, and materials. The report suggests that
[**[all]{.mark}** of these [are]{.mark} either [currently]{.mark} in
**[nascent]{.mark}** stages of development]{.underline} or are
undergoing rapid development.25

[Technology is labeled as "**emerging**" when it is **coming to
maturity**]{.underline}. At this stage, [[the use of such
tech]{.mark}nologies [is **not widespread**]{.mark}, nor are their
effects and functions **fully known**.]{.underline} Although a
[technology [maturity **timeline** is]{.mark}]{.underline} of- ten
**[[difficult to determine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, emerging technologies
make policymakers re- consider the status quo and ponder their
implications for future warfare.

Technologies considered "disruptive" are those that are expected to have
major or even revolutionary effects, but have yet to be exploited. For
ex- ample, they could undermine nuclear deterrence, increase risk of a
nuclear first strike, expand opportunities for crisis escalation, and
heighten insecu- rity caused by some form of duality in a technology.
Dual-purpose tech- nologies having both civilian and mil- itary uses or
application in both the conventional and nuclear realms can be
destabilizing.26 In contrast, some experts point out that
[[**disruptive** tech]{.mark}nologies can also [have **stabilizing**
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, [this could occur if a
technology were [to **improve early warning** and]{.mark} detection
mechanisms or enable new **[arms control]{.mark}** verifica- tion
measures.]{.underline}27

Other researchers disagree in principle, arguing that a technology
itself cannot be disruptive, stabilizing, or game-changing. This view
emphasizes the importance of technology adoption processes. For example,
here, the success of armed forces in using open architecture and modular
systems to absorb fast-paced technological changes is vitally important.
Ultimately, the military technology represents the means to the
political ends; only the ways in which the latter are achieved can be
disruptive.

Insights from the sociology of technol- ogy adoption can help in
understand- ing the hype surrounding hypersonic weapon systems and
temper unreal- istic expectations. In the early 1990s, Howard Fosdick
outlined the stages of technological development through scientific
discovery, innovation, and increased public awareness, but also through
failures and efforts along ul- timately unproductive avenues. He noted
that [the greatest amount of discussion about many technologies takes
place before they reach maturity, **prior** to their **real
use**]{.underline}. In doing so, he suggested that
[**[usability]{.mark}** of a technology [and]{.mark} its [**publicity**
are inversely correlated]{.mark}]{.underline}.28

According to the Gartner Hype Cycle, the most well-known cycle of
techno- logical progress built upon Fosdick's work on technology
adoption, a trending technology goes through five key phases, each of
which describes a state of attention towards the technology: 1) the
Innovation Trigger, marking a new technology or scientific discovery; 2)
the Peak of Inflated Expectations, when the technology gains publici-
ty; 3) the Trough of Disillusionment, when the limitations of the
technology come to the fore; 4) the Slope of Enlightenment, which comes
with a better understanding of the technolo- gy's utility; and 5) the
Plateau of Pro- ductivity, the stage of a mature application of the
"unhyped" technology.

Based on these criteria, data, AI, autonomy, space, and hypersonics will
produce significant or disruptive im- pacts on military capabilities
over the next five to 10 years, while quantum technology, biotechnology
and mate- rials are still emerging and will need 10--20 years to produce
their disrup- tive effects (see figure).29

This hype cycle shows that [the [attention does **not
represent**]{.mark} a [**technical** assessment]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Instead, [[it]{.mark} often [reflects]{.mark} the [**interests** of
**political actors** and]{.mark} profit-oriented
**[industries]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It also highlights the role that
media play in promoting the impatient expectation of an impending
industrial-military revolution. All technologies face the test of
proving their usefulness and viability, but this is something that
usually happens only after the hype fizzles out.

International security scholars and tech experts who look beyond the
allure of wonder weapons question the technical feasibility and military
effectiveness of hypersonic weapon sys- tems.30 They warn that these
systems have yet to reach maturity in terms of materials, propulsion,
and control. Indeed, even though unpropelled hy- personic gliders use
existing ballistic missile technology for their boost, such gliders may
only become fully operational by 2030 at the earliest.

### 1AR -- AT: LIO Transition

#### No LIO [impact]{.underline}\-\--U.S. leadership [decline]{.underline} is [inevitable]{.underline}, but [other countries]{.underline} solve.

International Relations, American University; Ph.D, Murdoch University),

capacity, global cooperation and world order," International Affairs,
Vol. 99, Issue 6, pp. 2339-2365, njn\] **\*Note: LHO = liberal hegemonic
order or liberal international order**

First, analysts and policy-makers need not choose between the extremes
of those who maintain that the LHO is 'passé' and those who insist on
its unchanging continuation into the future.41 As far as the interaction
capacity of nations---a key but understudied measure of world order---is
concerned, the truth is somewhere in between.

Fareed Zakaria has defined 'the post-American world' as 'not ... a world
defined by the decline of America but rather the rise of everyone
else'.42 While, at the time (2008), he was talking mainly about economic
and military power, his observation is also true for interaction
capacity, which he did not measure. As our article shows, [while [the
US]{.mark} remains dominant]{.underline} in absolute terms regarding the
total number of treaties signed since 1945, [it [has undergone]{.mark} a
**[relative decline]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is [[because of the
**growing role** of **other nations**]{.mark} and regional clusters that
have gained weight in different functional areas of global cooperation
with the passage of time]{.underline}. This article has identified
several nations[, such as Germany, China, India, Indonesia, Brazil,
Mexico, France, Russia, Canada, Argentina, Japan, the Philippines and
South Korea]{.underline}, which have significant roles in specific
functional areas. Furthermore, it is important to note that several of
these nations are not traditional leaders in the western LHO, but are
rising non-western powers.

Second, it is also important to note that the relative decline of the US
in interaction capacity as measured by treaty signings is relevant both
to assessing the level of power and primacy of the US as well as to the
prospects for world order more generally. It means that, [[while]{.mark}
elements of [the US]{.mark}-built [LHO will **survive**, it will **not
be hegemonic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It has to compete and co-exist with
other types of ordering, including those led by non-western powers on a
regional or cross-regional basis. US policy-makers and those in its
allied nations should pay attention to this trend. To the extent that
treaty-based interaction capacity and cooperation is one of the key
sources of US global power and primacy, its relative erosion cannot be
dismissed or overlooked in considering the future of the US-led world
order. In this context, instead of pining for the return of its global
primacy and the unipolar moment, building compromise and cooperation
with other nations---including less like-minded ones who are not members
of the LHO, but who are increasingly important to global cooperation and
public goods in a variety of non-military issue areas---will be
essential to the US ability to preserve the legacy of the LHO and
advance world peace and cooperation. This also strengthens the case for
stepping up efforts to reform the existing architecture of global
institutions to make it more democratic and responsive to the
aspirations of the newly emerging actors.

The third policy implication is that there is a clear need for
rethinking the architecture of global cooperation. As this article has
shown, [[there is **no single** global **leader**]{.mark} when it comes
to organizing cooperation; leadership in [global cooperation is
**increasingly pluralized**]{.mark}]{.underline}; and it varies over
time and issue areas, such as military, economic and environment. This
calls for revised and new ways of organizing multilateralism, allowing
other leaders or emerging nations such as China, India, Brazil, Mexico,
Indonesia or South Korea to assume increasing levels of leadership---of
course working together with longstanding, largely western LHO leaders
such as Canada, France, and Japan. Recent discussions regarding the
reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, including the WTO (governing
the multilateral trading regime) or the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund or other development banks (governing the global
development finance architecture) are some examples of the changing
nature of the global economic architecture.

Finally, in considering the future of world order one should take a
long-term view, rather than give in to short-term developments that are
the cause of much pessimism. It is short-sighted and self-defeating to
take the events of the past decade and a half, such as the 2008--09
global financial crisis, the COVID--19 pandemic, the Russia--Ukraine war
or the growing US--China rivalry as signaling the complete and
irreversible collapse of world order as a whole, as some American
analysts---such as Henry Kissinger, and Robert Blackwill and Thomas
Wright, in a Council on Foreign Relations report---have claimed.43
Instead, there is cause for some cautious optimism. Our analysis
suggests that world order still retains a multilateral (although less
US-centric) and not strictly geographic regional character. At the same
time, not only has the number of [[**cooperation** measures]{.mark} in
treaties]{.underline} and agreements among nations grown, these measures
have also become more globally spread out, involving an increasing
number of nations from all parts of the world. They [[create a]{.mark}
certain **['stickiness']{.mark}** in cooperative arrangements [that
cannot be]{.mark} completely or substantially **[broken]{.mark}** or
reversed [by]{.mark}]{.underline} a pandemic, an inter-European war or
[[**renewed** great power **competition**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such
events matter, of course, but [the existence of an [extensive]{.mark}
network of [treaty relationships **provide**]{.mark}s [a **durable
foundation**]{.mark} upon which repairs can be made to the fabric of
global cooperation]{.underline} once the most severe socio-economic
effects of the pandemic attenuate, the war between Russia and Ukraine
ends or a ceasefire is achieved, and the tension in US--China relations
thaws. These are not far-fetched possibilities. The pandemic is already
largely over, and if history is any guide, wars do end and dramatic
breakthroughs in great power competition do occur (as in US--China
relations in 1972). But whatever happens, we believe [[there is
**unlikely** to be a return to the **US-led LHO**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
More likely, the LHO would be [[supplanted by a]{.underline}]{.mark}n
[**increasingly multiplex** [world that]{.mark}]{.underline}, arguably,
[[could be more]{.mark} **inclusive** and
**[pluralistic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is a cause for some cautious
optimism.

[[Researchers are witnessing dramatic shifts in the behavior and
abundance of Arctic wildlife on land and sea]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
shifts coinciding with rapid warming and extreme weather. "[The speed of
change is really hard to comprehend,"]{.underline} says Kyle Joly, a
biologist with the U.S. National Park Service. Both in the Arctic and
around the globe, 2023 was by far the hottest year in recorded human
history. With global warming impacts highly magnified at the poles,
"[ecosystems are rearranging at every trophic level,"]{.underline} says
Arctic climate and policy expert Joel Clement. "[The Arctic is
transforming into a warmer, wetter ecological state before our
eyes."]{.underline} Habitats are eroding as glaciers and sea ice recede,
coastlines submerge, and permafrost thaws. Bays that were frozen
year-round are dotted with bobbing blue ice floes --- or have become
open sea. [[Radical shifts in weather and temperature reverberate across
these ecosystems, making it harder to find food, and increasing pressure
from competitors invading from the south]{.mark}. [No plant or animal is
exempt, from the microscopic plankton and crustaceans that fuel the
entire Arctic food web, to the region's iconic belugas and polar
bears]{.mark}, or the 200 or so migratory bird species that breed in the
Arctic.]{.underline} A disturbing question looms: [Can these animals
evolve quickly enough to adapt to what Clement calls ["a new geography
of survival]{.mark}"?]{.underline} Precious sea ice disappearing [A
[large number of Arctic organisms rely on sea ice during some or all of
their life cycles:]{.mark} swimming or sheltering below; attaching
beneath pack ice or hunting from atop; nestling in icy cracks; using it
as a bed, a nursery, feeding ground, or as a means to travel from one
place to another.]{.underline} Polar ice stretches thousands of miles,
touching the shores of eight nations, expanding and retreating in
synchrony with yearly cycles of continuous daylight and months-long
night. But over the past 40 years the Arctic Ocean has lost about 75% of
its sea ice volume, as measured at the end of the summer melt season.
This translates into a loss of both sea ice extent and thickness by half
on average, offering the most glaring evidence of climate change on
Earth. Shrinking habitat is just one of many issues threatening
wildlife. Sea ice is "the life machine of the Arctic ... a very
productive factory for food," says Knud Falk, an ecologist supporting
the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program. [Ice [edges are like
the coral reefs of the Arctic,]{.mark} a place where animals come to
feed and breed.]{.underline} At the end of the annual polar night, [[as
ice naturally melts, algae blooms at its edges, followed by
phytoplankton that thrives under the summer sun]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[This]{.underline}, in turn, [[draws zooplankton]{.mark} --- mostly
microscopic crustaceans called copepods --- [that feed]{.mark} bowhead
[whales]{.mark}, [seabirds and]{.mark} small [fish]{.mark}. Next come
polar cod, other large fish, seabirds, belugas, and four species of "ice
seals."]{.underline} In a decades-long study, [researchers identified
143 Arctic species that eat phytoplankton. [Many time their migrations
or breeding to coincide with ice-associated organic blooms. But the
location and amount of food is changing as the ice
disappears.]{.mark}]{.underline} The alabaster ivory gull needs sea ice
year-round and sometimes even nests on icebergs. In a warming Arctic,
its numbers are crashing. About 70% disappeared from Canada's north
since the 1980s. How these seabirds will fare in a sea ice-free Arctic
is questionable, notes Falk, an event which could occur as soon as
2030-2050, according to a recent study in the journal Nature
Communications. [Polar bears, the poster child for climate change, are
finding fewer, more disconnected ice platforms from which to
hunt]{.underline}. With their favored prey, threatened ringed seals,
growing ever rarer, the bears increasingly hunt on land, posing a new
threat to ground-nesting birds. The bears are now targeting seabird
colonies, ravaging the nests of ivory gulls, snow geese and other
species, behavior that Robert Rockwell, an ecologist at the American
Museum of Natural History, has observed in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, the
southern periphery of polar bear habitat. At his count, one bear
consumed 270 eider duck eggs in three days. The ultimate effect on bird
populations remains to be seen.

### 2AC -- Biodiversity Impact Framing (General)

#### Arctic ecosystem collapse has global implications. Increases risk of conflict and undermines global food chains. Action now to protect ecosystems critical to adaptation necessary for survival

More Than Just an Arctic Problem [[While these changes might seem
distant, don\'t be fooled --- we know their effects will ripple
globally]{.mark}. A shrinking ice sheet means rising seas, threatening
coastal infrastructure and communities.]{.underline} At the same time,
[the release of greenhouse gases from permafrost will accelerate
warming, making extreme weather events more frequent and intense. And
[as Arctic ecosystems struggle to adapt, the loss of habitat will impact
everything from marine food chains to Indigenous communities that rely
on the ice]{.mark}.]{.underline} See the figure below, which is one of
the best infographics I\'ve seen so far. But [[the consequences don\'t
end up here --- there are also geopolitical implications.]{.mark} The
sea ice retreat opens new shipping routes, [leading to potential
conflicts over resources and trade.]{.mark}]{.underline} That\'s why you
see [countries already positioning themselves to take advantage of an
ice-free Arctic, raising concerns about environmental and security
risks]{.underline}. Does some recent news make more sense now? While
they claim this is not happening, they are preparing themselves for when
it does. They just don\'t care. What Can Be Done? The research clarifies
that limiting warming to 1.5°C is no longer realistic. The world is
already beyond that threshold, and temperatures will continue to rise
even with current emissions pledges. However, the study also emphasizes
that every fraction of a degree matters. Stronger emissions cuts could
reduce the scale of Arctic transformation and slow its cascading
effects. Dr. Schuur stresses something climate scientists keep warning
us about: that adaptation is now just as important as
mitigation[.]{.underline} \"We can\'t stop change from happening; it\'s
already happening,\" he said. \"But we can slow the change by reducing
greenhouse gas emissions and managing the change as best as we can so
that people and ecosystems are better positioned for the future.\" That
means supporting policies that cut emissions and [investing in ways to
protect vulnerable communities. It also means rethinking how societies
build infrastructure, manage resources, and prepare for a world that
looks very different from the past. Basically, being proactive and
taking measures more seriously.]{.underline} And on a smaller scale,
individuals can push for local climate action, support sustainability
initiatives, and make choices that reduce personal carbon footprints.
Never underestimate the rippling effects that your actions can have on
your community. It is important to remember that the [[Arctic\'s
transformation is no longer a distant scenario --- it\'s happening now.
The choices made today will determine how much worse it gets and how
well people, ecosystems, and economies can adapt to the changes
ahead.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Is a Military Conflict Inevitable? [One school of thought believes that
the Arctic Five will fight hard for their sovereign rights in the
region]{.underline} and push for a further delimitation of the
continental shelf and maritime spaces, with Russia and Canada seeking to
establish exclusive control over the NSR and NWP. This scenario could
lead to the region's remilitarisation. With the outbreak of the war in
Ukraine in 2022, relations between the Western Arctic countries and
Russia have deteriorated. The Arctic institutional system has also
degraded.\[i\] The pessimists maintain that [even a military conflict
cannot be ruled out]{.underline} in the foreseeable future involving
both the regional and non-regional actors. [However, [regional players
do not yet have a sufficiently serious motivation to initiate an armed
conflict in the Arctic, and are unlikely to have one in the foreseeable
future]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[1j\] [[All the actors believe that the
challenges in the region can be resolved through negotiations and
diplomacy rather than by military force]{.mark}. The current [regional
military buildup is]{.mark}, from the point of view of Arctic actors,
more a means of [deterring]{.mark} each other than a preparation for a
real [military conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Lieu of a Conclusion
This essay argues that the [[Arctic players will work to resolve
existing and potential disputes]{.mark} not by force but [through
negotiations and international arbitration]{.mark}. Indeed, [the
countries of the region have more common interests than conflicting
ones]{.mark}, and therefore [the tendency to cooperate will eventually
prevail despite current tensions]{.mark}.]{.underline} While [Western
countries may be currently pursuing a confrontational policy in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [[there are still areas that are open to
cooperation with all stakeholders, among them: climate action,
environmental protection, biodiversity conservation]{.mark}, monitoring
ice and permafrost dynamics, search and rescue operations, prevention
and dealing with the consequences of natural and man-made disasters, the
well-being of indigenous peoples, [and sustainable development.]{.mark}
Despite the serious crisis of the regional institutional infrastructure,
it would be premature to talk about its collapse]{.underline}. The UN
structures---specifically the IMO, UNEP, UNDP, and UNESCO--- remain
operational in the Arctic. The Northern Forum and the Arctic Economic
Council also continue their activities, albeit not as actively as in the
earlier years. [There are signs of a revival of the Arctic Council's
activities at the working group level.]{.underline} It is safe to assume
that after the end of the Ukrainian conflict, which will reasonably
happen sooner or later, [it is likely that international Arctic
cooperation and regional institutional infrastructure will be fully
restored and the 'great Arctic game' will end, to the mutual benefit of
all players.]{.underline}

Beginning in the early 2000s, [the Arctic was increasingly seen as the
region that will underpin the vector of world economic and geopolitical
development in the 21st century]{.underline}.\[1\] Paradoxically,
however, until 2007---when Russia resumed maritime and air patrols in
the Arctic and North Atlantic and planted its titanium flag at the North
Pole at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean---the rest of the Arctic and
non-Arctic states paid little attention to this region. During the Cold
War, the Arctic was of geostrategic importance mainly in the context of
the rivalry between the United States (US) and the erstwhile USSR: in
the event of a full-scale war between the two powers, the shortest
routes for intercontinental ballistic missiles and strategic bombers
would run through the North Pole. Following the end of the Cold War and
the collapse of the USSR, the threat of global nuclear war disappeared,
and geopolitical interest in the Arctic declined. Domestically, Russia,
suffering systemic economic crises in the 1990s and early 2000s, stopped
paying attention to the development of its Arctic territories, whose
economic and human potential had significantly decreased. It was only
towards the end of the noughties that the situation began to change.
Russia "returned" to the Arctic, both domestically and internationally.
At the same time, other Arctic countries began to pay closer attention
to their northern territories and the region as a whole. [[The Arctic
has once again,]{.mark} and to a much greater extent than before,
[returned to the radar of]{.mark} global geoeconomics and
[geopolitics]{.mark}, and the 'great game' idea appeared in the global
political discourse in relation to the region.]{.underline} In this
backdrop, this essay explores a number of interrelated questions: What
attracts global attention to the Arctic? Who are the key players in the
region? How will this 'great game' likely evolve and what will be its
consequences for the world? [[The Arctic region holds]{.mark} immense
energy resources]{.underline} which, according to many experts, could
drive humanity's future (see Map 1). According to estimates, the Arctic
is endowed with 90 million barrels of oil, 47.3 trillion cubic meters of
gas, and 44 billion barrels of gas condensate;\[3\] it is also home to
nearly 25 percent of hydrocarbon unproven reserves.\[4\] Over 60 percent
of the Arctic oil and gas reserves are in territories that Russia
owns.\[a\] Potential coal reserves in Russia's Arctic region account for
nearly half of the country's coal resources---780 billion tonnes, of
which 81 billion tonnes are coking coals.\[5\] [The Arctic region is
also rich in non-ferrous and rare-earth metals,]{.underline} minerals,
ores, and other raw materials of strategic importance (see Map 1). The
Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF) boasts the biggest share of
these minerals (see Table 1). T[he third source of natural wealth in the
Arctic region are the ma[ssive biological resources of global
importance. The Arctic seas are the habitat of numerous unique marine
mammals]{.mark} including the polar bear, polar fox, narwhal, killer and
white whales, and the walrus. [Over 150 fish species]{.mark} live in the
Arctic and sub-Arctic waters, including the important ones for
fisheries---the cod, herring, haddock, pollock, and flounder. The Arctic
Ocean and Bering Sea fisheries [account for nearly 15 percent and 50
percent of the fish catch and sea food production in Russia and the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[7\] Fourth, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and
the Northwest Passage (NWP) along the northern coasts of Russia and
Canada are critical transport routes not only for these two countries
but for other states and regions. The passage from East Asia to Europe
and North America along these routes is shorter and safer (i.e.
piracy-free) than via the Suez Canal (see Map 2). For example, the route
from Yokohama (Japan) to Hamburg (Germany) via the NSR is 11,000 km,
while the length of this route through the Suez Canal is 18,350 km. This
reduces the journey time from 22 to 15 days, i.e. by about 40
percent.\[1b\] The route between the US northeast coast and East Asia
through the NWP is 17-percent shorter than through the Panama Canal.
Although the NSR and NWP cannot compare with their competitors (the Suez
and Panama Canals) in terms of traffic volumes, they remain potential
alternative routes to southern destinations. In addition, the NSR is the
only route for the delivery of LNG (liquefied natural gas) from Russia's
Yamal Peninsula to both Asia and Europe.\[c\] Furthermore, [[the Arctic
region is critical as it has consequences to the global environment in
terms of parameters such as climate and sea levels]{.underline}]{.mark}.
As the Arctic ice thaws,\[9\] [the natural resources and transport
communications are becoming more accessible to
stakeholders.]{.underline} The same factor is facilitating the emergence
of Arctic tourism, which will likely grow and become increasingly
profitable in the foreseeable future.\[d\]

### 2AC -- US-Russia Bilateral Cooperation Good 

#### Bilateral cooperation on conservation is empirically successful. It is key for building relationships between scientists and long-term projects which induce global follow-on

[[Key Achievements of U.S.-Russian Cooperation on Science and
Conservation]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Bering Strait Region 1.
[[Research cooperation improved understanding of transboundary
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}. In order [to manage and protect Arctic
wildlife]{.underline}, comprehensive baseline data about populations is
needed, but obtaining that data in the Bering Strait region, where it is
logistically difficult to operate, can be challenging. Many Arctic
species are also migratory or have large ranges that span national
borders, adding to the challenge of conducting research. [U.S.-Russian
research cooperation has vastly [improved understanding of shared
wildlife populations]{.mark}, including their numbers, behaviors, and
responses to the changing environment.]{.underline} Interviewees cited
the example of a research program established in the 1990s by Inupiat
whalers to document the size of the Bering- Chukchi-Beaufort Sea
population of bowhead whales. Without information from the Russian side
of the whales' range, uncertainty remained concerning the whales'
behaviors, distribution, and migration patterns. To address these gaps,
Chukchi whalers, supported by the Department of Wildlife Management of
Alaska's North Slope Borough, joined their Inupiat colleagues in
Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska, and combined their observations into a joint
report. [Through bilateral research programs, [U.S. and Russian
scientists developed shared research protocols]{.mark}, standardizing
data collection that allowed for comparison of results between regions
and over time. [The harmonization of data collection]{.mark} and
reporting [extended]{.mark} beyond the United States and Russia [to the
other Arctic states and enabled international assessments]{.mark} such
as the Arctic Council's State of the Arctic Marine Biodiversity Report,
[a milestone in monitoring]{.mark} circumpolar marine
[biodiversity]{.mark}.]{.underline} 2. [[Research cooperation
improved]{.mark} the [efficiency of research processes]{.mark}. [Pooling
resources and skills]{.mark} can make conducting research easier in the
vast, remote natural areas of the Bering Strait Regio]{.underline}n. For
example, one American ornithologist partially credited the success of a
study of Arctic shorebird populations to the skill of his Russian
partners in locating the birds' nesting sites. Migratory Great Knots,
Red Knots, and Surfbirds nest in low densities in upland and montane
ecosystems and are thus difficult to find. Without the Russian
ornithologists, obtaining results "would have taken double the time."
[[Sharing equipment is another benefit]{.mark} of bilateral research
programs]{.underline}. Per one Russian ornithologist, the distribution
of satellite tags to Russian researchers through a joint U.S.-Russian
research project enabled them to obtain "first-ever data on bird
migrations" for certain areas of the Bering Sea. [[Bilateral research
programs have produced innovative methods for studying
wildlife]{.mark}]{.underline} in hard-to- reach areas of the Bering
Strait Region. From the 1990s into the 2010s, U.S. agencies worked with
Russian biologists, Inupiat hunters, and Chukchi hunters to collect
observations of and attach radio tags to Pacific walruses. In the 2000s,
the United States and Russia conducted aerial surveys using thermal
sensors to document numbers and distributions of both Pacific walruses
and polar bears. [The information gathered through these research
efforts advanced knowledge of both species' regional distributions and
movements, and by extension, where and how they may be affected by sea
ice loss and industrial activities]{.underline}. 3. [[Exchanges between
U.S. and Russian scientists and conservationists led to increased
habitat conservation and better outcomes for wildlife]{.mark}.
Transboundary cooperation between U.S. and Russian biologists
[accelerated habitat conservation]{.mark} in a variety of landscape
types]{.underline}. When travel restrictions loosened after the fall of
the Soviet Union, Russian scientists and resource managers visited the
United States and observed how poor land management and overharvesting
had decimated wild salmon populations, while U.S. observers in the
Russian Far East gained an appreciation for the the unfragmented
condition of Russia's wild river systems. This exchange led to [[a
twenty-year initiative to map salmon rivers, culminating in]{.mark} the
first status assessment of salmon in the North Pacific and [the
protection of 6.4 million acres of land around salmon rivers]{.mark} in
the Russian Far East alone. Cooperation was bolstered by Western
donors - both government agencies and private charities - and
contributed to the development of environment-focused donor networks
within Russia. U.S. and Russian [cooperation led to the adoption of
international market standards and best management
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}. Per one interviewee, in response to
rampant salmon roe poaching in the Russian Far East in the 1990s, U.S.
and Russian NGOs worked together to popularize the concept of
environmental certification of fisheries through the globally recognized
Marine Stewardship Council, arranging site visits to Alaska and
providing technical support to Russian fishing companies. Today, about
70% of salmon fisheries in the Kamchatka region are MSC-certified.
Another interviewee, a Russian fisheries expert, pointed to the adoption
of seabird bycatch prevention measures by the Russian fishing industry.
After Alaskan longline fishermen successfully reduced seabird bycatch by
using streamer deterrents on their fishing gear, U.S. and Russian
researchers quantified the costs of seabird bycatch for the Russian
fishing fleet in the western Bering Sea, while a coalition of other
partners - the Pacific Institute of Geography in Kamchatka, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Association (NOAA), and the U.S. Consulate in Vladivostok - collaborated
to transfer streamers from Alaska to Kamchatka. Convinced of the
economic benefits of seabird bycatch reduction, the Russian fishing
sector eventually began to manufacture their own streamers. In the
1990s, [local activists in Sakhalin]{.underline}, concerned about the
impacts of Russia's budding offshore oil development, [coordinated
advocacy campaigns with U.S. NGOs to persuade the International Monetary
Fund, the European Reconstruction and Development Bank, and the World
Bank to require proper disposal of drilling wastes as a condition of
investment in Russian oil corporations. The Sakhalin standard - to
reinject drilling wastes into the seafloor rather than dumping into the
marine ecosystem - became a national regulation which is still upheld
today]{.underline} [[Exchanges of experts strengthened capacity for
conservation on both sides of the strait]{.underline}.]{.mark} Per one
interviewee, under the auspices of the 1974 bilateral Agreement On
Cooperation in the Field of Protection of the Environment and Natural
Resources ("U.S.-Russian Environmental Agreement"), dozens of
scientists, educators, and managers conducted site international site
visits to protected areas in both the United States and Alaska. These
site visits directly led to the "sister refuge" partnership between the
Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and the Commander Islands
Zapovednik ("Nature Reserve"), [[which later spawned joint programs on
invasive species prevention, seabird monitoring, and biological data
sharing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Exchanges under the U.S.-Russian
Environmental Agreement also heavily emphasized youth education,
inspiring the establishment of environmental education departments in
Russia's national nature reserve system across the entire country, and
regional or local initiatives such as the Seabird Youth Network for
students from Russia's Commander Islands and Alaska's Pribilof Islands.

[[The Earth is approaching a critical threshold of irreversible
biodiversity loss]{.underline}]{.mark}. World leaders, environmental
activists, and prominent researchers are gathered in Colombia for the
16th meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP16) to the Convention on
Biological Diversity. Their aim is to push forward progress on the
Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework---a landmark agreement to
halt biodiversity loss by 2030. Despite the urgency, more than 85% of
countries failed to submit new national biodiversity pledges ahead of
the summit. Why might this be of interest to readers of The Lancet?
Because [biodiversity loss is a vitally important health issue. A
human-driven mass extinction is underway]{.underline}. The 2024 Living
Planet Report reveals that the average size of monitored [wildlife
populations has shrunk by 73% in just 50 years]{.underline}, with the
steepest declines in Latin America and the Caribbean (95%), Africa
(76%), Asia--Pacific (60%), and in freshwater ecosystems (85%). Although
estimates vary, [the species extinction rate is thought to be 10--100
times higher than the natural baseline. This rapid loss of species is
driven by anthropogenic overpopulation, habitat destruction,
exploitation, and climate change]{.underline}. Industrialised societies
have long adopted an extractionist perspective towards the natural
world, viewing ecosystems as resources to be exploited and consumed for
profit. Yet, in this pursuit, we ignore that [[the very ecosystems we
destroy are key to our surviva]{.mark}l. The evidence is irrefutable.
Biodiversity sustains us]{.underline}---it underpins the food we eat,
the water we drink, and the oxygen we breathe. Anthropogenic
environmental changes including [[changes to biodiversity are increasing

COVID-19 pandemic underscores the precarious link between biodiversity
loss and human health. [Maintaining [ecological integrity is crucial to
limit the emergence of zoonotic diseases]{.mark} and prevent their harms
to human health, economies, and societies.]{.underline} [[Numerous
pharmaceutical drugs had their origin in the natural
world]{.underline}]{.mark}---penicillin originates from Penicillium
chrysogenum, a fungus; morphine is derived from the opium poppy. U[p to
70% of all cancer drugs are from natural products or synthetic compounds

and essential drugs originate in flowering plants. Furthermore, WHO
estimates that [[more than 80% of the world\'s population use some form
of traditional medicine]{.underline}]{.mark}. [There are probably
several [millions of undiscovered species]{.mark} and many [will go

[The Russian Arctic is a vast territory]{.underline} that includes the
Murmansk Region, the Nenets, Yamalo-Nenets and Chukchi Autonomous Okrugs
and the northern municipalities of the Arkhangelsk Region, the Komi
Republic, the Krasnoyarsk Territory, the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), as
well as lands and islands located in the Arctic Ocean that are part of
the Russian Federation. Therefore, [[it is especially important for
Russia to preserve the unique ecological systems of the Arctic and
maintain this region as a zone of peace and
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the 1930s and 1980s, when the
process of intensive development of the Arctic was underway, in parallel
with the emergence of new enterprises, the environmental situation in
the region deteriorated, since few people were engaged in waste
disposal. However, [in recent years, [Russia's environmental policy has
sharply intensified]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[The main measures for the
implementation of state policy in the field of environmental safety in
the Arctic zone of Russia is the establishment of special environmental
management and environmental protection regimes, including monitoring of
its pollution, reclamation of natural landscapes and disposal of toxic
industrial waste]{.underline},"13) Murad Kerimov stated, Deputy Head of
the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology of Russia. In addition, in
the Year of Ecology (2017), the Clean Country project was launched in
the Russian Federation. [It assumes a reduction in the amount of
environmental damage associated with the disposal of solid household
waste and objects of accumulated damage throughout our country by
2025.]{.underline} Currently, the Clean Country project includes three
activities carried out in the Arctic: the elimination of harm in the
Franz Josef Land archipelago, the elimination of oil pollution of the
Kuznetsov Creek in the Arkhangelsk region and the elimination of the
tailings storage of the Kular Gold mining Factory in the Republic of
Sakha (Yakutia). In 2022 Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} held a meeting on the
development of the Arctic, where the President [noted that the
development of the Arctic should not destroy its ecology]{.mark}. "We
consider all programs and projects in the Arctic in close connection
with the tasks of preserving biodiversity and Arctic ecosystems, as well
as with long term work to address the challenges of the climate agenda,"
Vladimir Putin claimed]{.underline}.14) In the field of international
cooperation, [[Russia intends to: strengthen on a bilateral basis and
within the framework of regional organizations]{.mark}, including the
Arctic Council and the Barents Council/The Euro-Arctic region,
[good-neighborly relations with the Arctic States; to intensify
economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation in the
Arctic;]{.mark} to increase the efforts of the Arctic states in creating
a unified regional system of search and rescue, as well as the
prevention of man-made disasters and the elimination of their
consequences]{.underline}.15) Russian interests in the Arctic go deep
into the past --- in the sixteenth century, when the Russian state,
driven by a constant desire to gain access to new natural resources and
reliable trade routes, began the conquest of Siberia. For the Russian
Federation, as the country with the largest territory and population
living in the region out of the Arctic states, the tasks of sustainable
development in the Arctic are highly significant. For instance, on
September 22, 2020, the first general meeting of the members of the
Interregional Scientific, Technological, Business and Educational
Partnership "Sustainable Development of the Arctic Zone of the Russian
Federation" was held in an online format with the support of the
Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation. Despite
the fact that the country has not adopted a unified strategy in the
field of sustainable development containing references to the UN 2030
Agenda, many of the SDG objectives are reflected in separate documents,
such as the Presidential Decree "On National goals and strategic
development objectives of the Russian Federation for the period up to
2024."16) [[Sustainable development of the Arctic zone of the Russian
Federation is one of the priorities of state
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Evidence of this is the Decree of the
President of the Russian Federation No. 645 dated October 26, 2020.17)
[[The most important state document]{.mark} "On the Strategy for the
development of the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation and ensuring
national security for the period up to 2035" has been
adopted]{.underline}. This is the result of a long public discussion
conducted by the Ministry of the Russian Federation for the Development
of the Far East and the Arctic and the Arctic Development Project
Office. [The Strategy [defines]{.mark} the main [directions]{.mark},
tasks and measures [for the development of the Arctic zone, as well as
the mechanisms, stages and expected results of their
implementation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the Decree, the President set
specific goals for the development of the Arctic zone of the country.
First of all, these are goals related to improving the quality of life
of 2.5 million citizens living in the Arctic zone, goals related to the
growth of the economy of the Arctic regions, and the development of the
Northern Sea Route as a global transport corridor. [[The document
fundamentally differs from the previous]{.mark} strategy and previously
existing [strategic planning documents]{.mark} in general in two key

**CCP Legitimacy Advantage**

**[2AC -- AT: Won't Invade Taiwan]{.underline}**

**Comprehensive analysis of Chinese politics AND internal leadership
confirms.**

**Cheng 22** \[Dean Cheng (Senior Research Fellow, Asian Studies Center,
The Heritage Foundation), 9-23-2022, "Why Taiwan Matters to Beijing,"
Heritage Foundation, no. 3725, njn\]

It is a common fallacy to think that [an **authoritarian**
government]{.underline} does not [have to **worry** about
**legitimacy**]{.underline}. In reality, [[authoritarian systems do have
to **justify** their **hold on power**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They do not
have to do so through elections, but inflationary food prices, famine,
massive unemployment, failure to handle natural disasters, and military
defeats may all undermine their perceived legitimacy. [While an
authoritarian system has more **repressive tools** at its
disposal]{.underline}, such as monitoring the Internet and arresting
dissidents, [such steps can work **only** as long as there is a broader
**tolerance**]{.underline} of the regime's right to rule.

For the CCP, [the issue of legitimacy will be especially
**critical**]{.underline} in the interval between 2022 (the centennial
of the CCP's creation) and 2049 (the 100th anniversary of the founding
of the PRC). Given the suffering the CCP inflicted on China during its
first decades, including the famine of the Great Leap Forward
(1957--1960) and the chaos of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
1966--1976), [it is **essential** that the party's governance now be
**marked** by **improvement** and advancement.]{.underline}

Consequently, China's state-controlled press emphasizes the evolution of
the PRC from a barely industrialized kingdom at the beginning of the
20th century to an economy with the world's second largest GDP and major
space and information technology capabilities, ascribing these advances
to the party's leadership. A Chinese astronaut recently noted that his
mission "added a heroic chapter to the 100-year history of the struggle
of the Party."4 Another Chinese article notes that the party's rule has
led to "technological advancements in such areas as military power,
artificial intelligence, med- ical research, e-commerce and
infrastructure development."5

[[As a **centerpiece** of]{.mark} its claim to [**legitimacy**, the CCP
argues]{.mark} that [it is **righting** the]{.mark} wrongs of the
[past]{.mark}]{.underline}---in particular, the "Century of
Humiliation." That century began in 1842 with the First Opium War, waged
by Great Britain in order to compel China to accept the sale of British
opium in the streets of China. China's loss led not only to the opening
of China to British opioid sales, but also to the seizure of Hong Kong
as a British colony. For the next several decades, [[China lost **wars**
and **territory**]{.mark} while also having to accept various forms of
humiliation]{.underline} such as the imposition of "most favored nation"
conditions, under which China could not set its own tariff rates but had
to limit them to the levels accorded to "most favored nations."

There is a tendency in some analytical circles to dismiss this narrative
as Chinese propaganda. It is propaganda, but it is also the nation's
founding myth and deeply held belief. The CCP uses the average Chinese
person's attachment to that myth to its political advantage. This CCP
narrative picks up with the rise of the CCP, its victory in the Chinese
civil war, and the reversal of China's decline. China regained the
respect of other states as its material situation improved. In a speech
commemorating the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese
leader Xi Jinping reminded the audience of the "Century of Humiliation"
before declaring that "the Party and the Chinese people showed the world
that the Chinese people had stood up, and that the time in which the
Chinese nation could be bullied and abused by others was gone forever."6

[[For the CCP, an **essential** part of **regaining**]{.mark} this
international [respect is]{.mark} the [**recovery** of]{.mark} various
**[territories]{.mark}**]{.underline} lost by previous regimes
(including the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China), and Taiwan is an
especially prominent part of that narrative of renewed respect.

In the wake of the First Sino--Japanese War (1894-1895), China was
forced to cede Taiwan to the growing Japanese empire. Like Hong Kong,
the loss of Taiwan was emblematic of the humiliation visited upon China
by foreigners. According to the CCP, Taiwan's continued sepa- ration is
due in part to the United States and its meddling in China's "internal
affairs."

This latter aspect gains further salience because [Taiwan's separate
status was not due initially to a **desire** for
**independence**]{.underline}; rather, [[Taiwan is seen as the last
**unresolved element** of the]{.mark} Chinese **[Civil
War]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan, it was
not to lead a secessionist movement, but because Chiang's Nationalists
had been defeated on the mainland. For the CCP, [a China that does not
include Taiwan is a China that is **not whole**.]{.underline}

Xi's speech on the founding of the CCP is also emblematic of the reality
that since 2012, the issue of party legitimacy has been bound up in the
persona of Xi Jinping. When former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping ruled,
he made a deliberate effort to reduce the CCP's identification with any
single individual, reversing the near deification of Mao Zedong. Instead
of the cult of personality that surrounded Mao, Deng sought to inculcate
a policy of consensus leadership. The top leader (Deng Xiaoping, Jiang
Zemin, Hu Jintao) was important, but he was sharing power (and
responsibility) with the other 24 members of the CCP Politburo and
especially the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). This made each of the
top leaders that succeeded Mao less powerful, but it also meant that
mistakes were not the sole responsibility of the top leader.

Since assuming the top state and CCP positions in 2012, Xi Jinping has
assiduously reversed Deng's policy of collective, consensus leadership.
Instead, he has arrogated to himself far more power than either of his
post-Deng predecessors held. He is now the head of an array of "leading
small groups," the organizational cells that actually manage key issues,
linking the PRC state government and the CCP's top leadership. He has
largely installed his own people in the PSC and reduced its role. The
anti-corruption campaigns that have continued since he came to power
have been used not only against actual corruption (one of the greatest
threats to CCP legitimacy), but also to attack Xi's opponents. Not since
Mao has a single person so dominated the Chinese political scene.

Nonetheless, [[no **Chinese leader**]{.mark} or anyone else who aspires
to leadership [can **afford** to be]{.mark} seen as **[soft on
Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Any leader who **sits by**]{.mark} as
Taiwan makes real steps toward independence]{.underline} (for example,
by gaining a seat at the U.N. or expanding its diplomatic recognition)
[[would be accused of "**losing**" Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
political resonance of "Who lost Taiwan?" in the PRC would be comparable
to the political resonance of the 1950s "Who lost China?" debate in the
United States. [Any leader or faction that "lost" Taiwan would suffer [a
**significant** domestic **political loss**]{.mark} as well as a foreign
policy loss]{.underline}. Depending on political developments in Taiwan,
this equation extends to even smaller "losses," such as Taiwan's gaining
new meaningful participation in international organizations and
seemingly innocuous changes in the diplomatic treatment of Taiwan by
nations around the world.

For Xi Jinping, these issues are of particular urgency in 2022 when the
CCP will be holding its 20th Party Congress. It is expected that Xi will
manage to stay in staying in power beyond the previous norm of two terms
and probably beyond three. This will allow him to remain as head of both
state (having amended the Chinese constitution to abolish term limits in
2017) and the party for 10 more years, overturning Deng Xiaoping's
limits on leadership. Such a move undoubtedly antagonizes key elements
and factions within the CCP, many of whom have already suffered losses
of power due to Xi's sustained "anti-corruption" campaigns.7

At the same time, the PRC continues to be roiled by the effects of
COVID. Cities that have followed lockdowns have been unable to meet
production schedules as residents protest and even riot on a small
scale. Meanwhile, food prices were rising even before the most recent
bout of inflation as diseases decimated livestock herds.

These disasters make the triumphal tone of a centenary of CCP leadership
ring hollow. As important, having arrogated so much power to himself, Xi
now cannot avoid bearing at least some responsibility for the problems
that have arisen on his watch. Given these pressures, [[Xi
cannot]{.mark} afford to be seen as **[relax]{.mark}**ing [the goal of
**reunification**]{.mark} with Taiwan]{.underline}, as [[it would
undermine]{.mark} not only party legitimacy, but [his]{.mark} own
[personal **claim to power**]{.mark} as well.]{.underline}

#### Sustained US commitment to the Arctic is key. Climate and environmental policies are a key area where the US can cooperate in the Arctic with Russia and China

In addition to monitoring Arctic developments for these red flags, the
U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), working in collaboration with
interagency and international partners, can take steps to maintain and
reinforce current factors of resilience, and to address some of the gaps
and uncertainties that remain. We present five specific recommendations.
[A first recommendation is to not only maintain solidarity among U.S.
allies and part- ners in the Arctic, but also to strengthen it wherever
possible]{.underline}. There is a strong consensus among Arctic states
to maintain the governance of Arctic affairs among themselves, and this
remains a powerful obstacle to undesirable Chinese involvement in the
region. This rec- ommendation calls for sustaining active multilateral
and bilateral diplomatic activities with these countries and in the
Arctic Council and other international fora. In addition, DoD and the
U.S. Coast Guard have important roles in maintaining, and in some cases
enhanc- ing, engagement with other Arctic states---minus
Russia---through security cooperation activities, which range from
high-level exchanges to exercises, to joint training, to maritime domain
awareness and safety activities (particularly with counterparts in
Canada, Norway, and Denmark and in the context of certain North American
Aerospace Defense Command \[NORAD\] and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization \[NATO\] activities). A second recommendation is to
[[explore the]{.mark} conditions and possible [pathways for restoring
some level of engagement with Russia on Arctic issues]{.mark} in the
wake of its war on Ukraine]{.underline}. The suspension of the
cooperation within the Arctic Council under the Russian chairmanship
represents a break with previous periods of tension (e.g., after
Russia's 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and aggression in Eastern
Ukraine) that had seen the continua- tion of the Arctic Council's
activities. [Although [reengagement does not have to be immediate or
cover all topics, concertation and common work in]{.mark} such areas as
search and rescue (SAR) or [pollution prevention would benefit all
Arctic Council members, including the United
States]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Some degree of reengagement might also
help maintain Russia's commitment to the Arctic
Council]{.underline}---an organization that the United States values,
with U.S. Coordinator for the Arctic Region James DeHart noting that it
wanted to maintain it in its current structure and with the current
membership.3 [A potential adverse outcome of the current paralysis of
the Arctic Council could be a push from Russia for a new]{.underline}
(or drastically changed) [Arctic gov- ernance institution, in which it
would not be the only non-NATO member]{.underline} (in the expecta- tion
that Finland and Sweden join NATO), [and where other Arctic-interested
states---such as China---might have a louder voice]{.underline}.4
Although Russia has not yet shown signs that it wishes to move on from
the Arctic Council (calling instead for a resumption of the Arctic
Council's activities), [complete and protracted paralysis could harm
current Arctic governance and provide an opening for China to insert
itself more decisively in that system]{.underline}.5 [Such engagement
could help convince Russia that it has more to gain from maintaining the
status quo]{.underline} (that has worked fairly well for Moscow so far)
[in the Arctic rather than take the chance of bring- ing in
another---and bigger---player.]{.underline} Although defense and
security cooperation with Russia remain unlikely for the foreseeable
future, **[[the Arctic is a place where cooperation can and has taken
place on other areas of mutual interest during periods of
tension]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Western cooperation with Russia on
Arctic]{.underline} SAR, which [has implications for military and
commercial activities]{.underline}, was continued after other defense
and scientific engagement were suspended in 2014 follow- ing Moscow's
2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and aggression in eastern Ukraine.
**[[Another large area of mutual interest with Russia and China will be
countering the effects of climate change in the Arctic region, including
engaging on infrastructure resilience]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A third
recommendation is for the United States to work closely with other
Arctic states, particularly Denmark and Canada, to maintain active
engagement with the Greenlandic government to promote mutual interests
and sustainable economic development. The United States has taken
positive steps in this regard, including reopening a consulate in Nuuk
in 2020; initiating cooperation on education, trade and investment,
science, minerals and energy, and economic growth; and a May 2021 visit
by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Greenland during which he
pledged to further this partnership. This cooperation should be designed
first and foremost with the interests of the Greenlandic population in
mind---the key question being: How can U.S. engagement benefit
Greenlanders as clearly and directly as possible, and make the United
States appear as a long-term, promising partner? The new arrangement,
negotiated in 2020, regarding Thule Air Base---whose maintenance will
now largely be undertaken by Greenlandic companies rather than U.S.
ones---is an example that DoD's presence can add value by supporting the
local economy and contributing---even on a small scale---to addressing
long-standing unemployment issues in Greenland. A fourth recommendation
is for [[the United States to continue to elevate its engagement in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Our TTX participants highlighted [the
importance of [making it clear to both other Arctic and non-Arctic
states that the U.S. commitment to the region is solid.]{.mark} [This
commitment should]{.mark} not [be]{.mark} solely [based on the strategic
role that the Arctic plays]{.mark} in strategic competition with Russia
[and]{.mark} China, but rather is the continuation, at an ever more
sustained level, of [the long history of U.S. diplomacy, stewardship,
and scientific research in the region]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As [[the international science community struggles to figure out whether
abandoned and interrupted research programs can be
salvaged]{.underline}]{.mark}, some experiments are underway that may
offer useful models. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey is working
to uphold a shared data management arrangement. Nearly thirty years ago,
when Soviet-era walrus management agencies were collapsing, Russian
researchers reached out to establish a mechanism with their U.S.
counterparts to protect hard-won walrus biology and survey data. The
bilateral agreement, known as the Pacific Walrus International Database,
placed these data in the hands of U.S. counterparts who agreed to
maintain the data and only share the data with the permission of a
Russian scientist representing the successor to the Soviet research
agency. Current requests to access these data for research studies are
on hold until the U.S. agency has permission to resume communications
with Russian counterparts.32 One effort to allow for the sharing of data
is an open-access online platform launched in 2021 by WWF's U.S. Arctic
Program and the Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS). Together, these
two NGOs created a user-friendly online tool for Russian and American
emergency responders in the Bering Strait region. The Bering Strait
Online Response Tool is a visu- alization tool comprised of maps of
sensitive areas and data about the distri- bution of wildlife species on
both sides of the Bering Strait. Even before the war in Ukraine, the
project faced some challenges, particularly inadequate data from Russia.
When collaboration between U.S. and Russian NGOs paused in the spring of
2022, AOOS pivoted from making this a bilateral tool toward using it to
inform Oil Spill Response Organizations (OSROs) and the U.S. Coast
Guard.33 Although this particular joint project was postponed, in
theory, the approach of making biological and bathymetric information
publicly available both in English and Russian could represent an
acceptable form of cooperation in the absence of direct communication.
Another venue facilitating limited contact between Western and Russian
experts on Arctic issues is ArcticPortal, an online forum hosted by the
Arctic Foundation in Akureyri, Iceland, which organizes workshops and
seminars between Russian and Western scholars on Arctic issues.34
Fortunately, [despite the many disruptions in work across the Arctic,
some research relationships are continuing]{.underline}. One of those is
the Joint Russian-Norwegian Group on Arctic Fisheries. A critical
outcome of the group's work is the production of a report aimed at
filling data gaps resulting from Russia's temporary suspension from the
International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).35 This
program may serve as an important collaborative platform to build upon
when geopolitical circumstances allow full-fledged cooperation to
resume. Finally, a promising area to maintain communication is the joint
work conducted under the umbrella of established agreements such as the
Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement. The agreement creates a frame-
work for international collaboration on scientific research in the
Central Arctic Ocean. Ongoing discussions have been facilitated by
Canada and South Korea, enabling some progress to be made.36 THE PATH
FORWARD [[To ensure that conservation and science can resume in the
future, priority must be given to maintaining networks of collaborators
and communication among long-time partners]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Relationships that developed over three decades and contributed
significantly to improving understanding of the Arctic are still
valuable and important. At this time, academic institutions, NGOs, and
Indigenous peoples' groups can use their relative flexibility to
maintain some of these connections by, for example, facilitating
webinars and moder- ating online discussions. To prevent the complete
isolation of once-active contributors to Arctic science and
conservation, Western research entities should allow Russian authors to
be considered, on a merit basis, for publica- tion in peer-reviewed
scientific journals. Additionally, to lay a foundation for much-needed
future generations of scientists and conservationists who can work
together, Western entities can facilitate the participation of young
Russians---now increasingly isolated from the West---in conferences,
even if that involves waiving registration fees, which are often costly
for students and technically difficult due to the disabled SWIFT banking
system. Also, during this time of heightened tensions, [[governments of
the Arctic]{.mark} and other Western nations]{.underline}, along with
Indigenous peoples' orga- nizations and the science and conservation
communities, [[can evaluate the key lessons learned from three decades
of Western-Russia collaboration and identify opportunities for new
institutions and third countries to enter the realm of
cooperation]{.mark} as potential mediators, catalysts, implementers, and
bridges for communication]{.underline}.
[[Government]{.underline}]{.mark} and non-governmental [[bodies alike
should consider potential sources of future funding and modes of
distribution of financial support for future projects]{.mark}. Together,
all of [these entities should invest in strategic thinking about
research in climate, biodi- versity, ocean health, and fisheries and
develop a prioritized plan to move forward as soon as more direct and
open communication is possible with the Russian government.]{.mark} Such
interim measures can help preserve collegiality, a foundation on which
future collaboration could be built.]{.underline} This overview of
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} challenges and [[benefits encountered by the
Arctic countries through decades of cooperation in biodiversity conser-
vation serves as a compelling justification for sustaining
dialogue]{.mark} amid current geopolitical tensions. [The ecosystems and
residents of the Arctic]{.mark} as well as those located far beyond the
Arctic region [are feeling the acute impacts of climate change and
environmental degradation. The core rationale for continuing
communication among adversaries is grounded in the understanding that
the planet cannot wait for action.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Political will]{.mark}]{.underline} We have indications that [[Russia
prioritizes restarting co-operation at the Arctic
Council]{.mark}.]{.underline} This would require western states to lift
sanctions imposed as a result of the invasion. Simply put, [[resuming
co-operation will hinge on the political willingness of the seven other
Arctic states to re-engage with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. But this
path is obviously dependent on a change in Russian conduct. As stated by
David Balton, director for the White House Arctic Executive Steering
Committee, resuming co-operation with Russia at the council is "largely
up to Russia, it's not up to us." Similar sentiments are echoed by
Markku Heikkilä, from the Arctic Centre at the University of Lapland:
"As long as (Vladimir) Putin or a Putin-like regime sits in Moscow,
there is no returning to business-as-usual with Russia." The June 2022
closing of the Norwegian Consulate General in Murmansk, Russia, in
northwest Russia and above the Arctic Circle, was announced as a
temporary measure. But Norway's foreign affairs minister, Anniken
Huitfeldt, also added: "There are few indications that the situation
will improve, and the closing may thus be long-lasting." [[The mood is
sombre and pessimistic indeed]{.mark}, especially given that a
Putin-less regime is unlikely to emerge in Russia and that Russia is
pursuing its war of aggression with no reservation or regret. [That
makes it unlikely that goodwill gestures will soon mend bridges with
other Arctic states.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The Russian annexation of Crimea affected the Arctic]{.mark} in
limited ways]{.underline}. [[The West stopped military dialogues with

energy projects,]{.underline} as the US \$27 billion Yamal LNG project,
which initially had Russian Novatek (60 per cent), French Total (20 per

Sanctions forced Novatek to sell 9.9 per cent to the Chinese
government's Silk Road Fund and rely on Chinese bank funding. [Russia
responded to these sanctions with counter sanctions on Western food
exports to Russia, which also affected some Arctic seafood export to
Russia. Russia accepted Faroese salmon exports, which led to a boom in
Faroese economy. In 2014, there was some protests in the Arctic Council

### 2AC -- Trump Says Yes

#### Trump wants to work with Russia in the Arctic, it's one of the places he's specifically targeted for normalizing relations

[[US and Russian officials have identified the Arctic as a possible area
for]{.mark} economic [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to
people familiar with the situation, [[part of the broader
detente]{.mark} President Donald [Trump is pursuing with Moscow]{.mark}.
Discussions have included]{.underline} natural resources [[exploration
and trade routes]{.mark},]{.underline} said the people, who asked not to
be identified as the discussions are private and at an early stage.
[[Cooperation over energy exploration]{.mark} is also seen as a goal by
the US,]{.underline} one of the people said. [The topic emerged as Trump
has aggressively pursued an end to the war in Ukraine]{.underline},
including direct talks with Russia's President Vladimir Putin. [[Both
sides have recently signaled that they're open to]{.mark} business
ventures and [cooperation]{.mark},]{.underline} alarming European and
NATO allies, which have sought to isolate Moscow since its full-scale
invasion of Ukraine three years ago. US and Russian officials plan to
meet in Istanbul on Thursday to discuss restoring embassy staffing
levels, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. One of the
people said US officials see Arctic cooperation as a way to drive a
wedge between Moscow and Beijing, but cautioned that was unlikely to
succeed given how much closer Russia and China have grown in recent
years, particularly with their "no-limits" partnership since the war in
Ukraine began. A spokesperson for the US National Security Council
declined to comment. A spokesman for the Kremlin didn't immediately
respond to a request for comment. [The Arctic]{.underline}, encircled by
Russia and seven NATO members --- the US, Canada and the Nordics
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden --- [has drawn increasing
attention in recent years as melting ice from climate change opens up
shipping lanes and the possibility to explore for potential energy and
mineral resources.]{.underline} Kirill Dmitriev, head of the state-owned
Russian Direct Investment Fund, said after US-Russia talks in Saudi
Arabia this month that cooperation on Arctic energy projects was among
"specific areas of cooperation" they discussed, Politico reported. Late
last year, the Pentagon released a new Arctic Strategy that highlighted
the risk of China and Russia teaming up in the region. Under the
Biden-era policy, the US aimed to expand its military readiness and
surveillance in the Arctic in response to "growing alignment" between
Moscow and Beijing. China has increasingly focused on the Arctic in
recent years, declaring itself in 2018 a "near-Arctic state" and has
developed fishing, energy and transportation interests in the region.
The prospect of new shipping routes is seen as key to Beijing's
strategy, which envisions a Polar Silk Road connecting East Asia,
Western Europe and North America.

Pointless collapse

But if that doesn\'t happen, I will answer the first question. Given all
the contradictions, [[does the Arctic Council]{.mark} still [have **any
value?**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Squeezed between American fascism and Russian dictatorship.

[The simple answer is **[yes]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

And perhaps that is [precisely [**because** of]{.mark} the severe
[built-in **conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yes, because [**every**
international cooperation, **[any dialogue]{.mark}**, [has **value**
in]{.mark} a world in **[turmoil]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In such a
situation, [[every]{.mark} open [door is an **opportunity** to
avoid]{.mark} a meaningless and [catastrophic
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline} of humanism and the economy.

So perhaps [the democratic **[states]{.mark}** of Canada, Sweden,
Denmark, Finland, and Iceland [will manage to find **common
ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even when squeezed between American
fascism and Russian dictatorship.

Perhaps [[Russia and the USA could]{.mark} even [see]{.mark} the
inherent [**value** in]{.mark} a sort of
**[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} between Arctic neighbors.

On Monday next week, after the digital meeting, we might know more.

Although the meeting is closed to the press, we will know if Russia has
participated in or boycotted the meeting. And we know more about the US
position, even though US positions have largely had shorter shelf lives
than a carton of cream.

We of High North News will be present, both in the corridors and at the
subsequent press conference.

[As Russian forces continue to batter civilian targets [in
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, acting in unrestrained defiance of
international law, [nations and organizations around the world have
chastised and imposed harsh punishments on Moscow. But [justified though
this outrage may be]{.mark}, in some cases [the perils of alienating
Russia outweigh the benefits]{.mark}. Here, [the Arctic is a crucial
case study. The region's geopolitical importance and fragile system of
governance make it fertile ground for either cooperation or
conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline} And though [over the past quarter century
the Arctic Council has sustained a workable base level of cooperation,
[the consequences of a]{.mark} recent [decision]{.mark} by seven of its
eight member states [to boycott council activities over Russia]{.mark}'s
military aggression [could prove devastating]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
Arctic's strategic importance owes in large part to its profound mineral
wealth. Courtesy of climate change, rising temperatures are rapidly
thawing barriers to the region's bountiful natural resources. According
to the Stimson Center, the region may contain up to 90 billion barrels
of oil and 47 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, while the Wall
Street Journal estimates the Arctic may contain some \$1 trillion worth
of rare-earth metals---a set of 17 precious metallic elements with
critical importance for national defense equipment and consumer
electronics. Other sources of mineral wealth in the region include large
stores of gold, platinum, tin, diamonds, and zircon-titanium, as
explored in a recent study published in Ore Geology Reviews. [The Arctic
Council was established in 1996 in a bid to foster cooperation and
coordination among the eight Arctic states]{.underline}---Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United
States---[as well as Indigenous peoples and other regional
stakeholders]{.underline}. [These member states act as stewards of the
region, implementing a patchwork of national, regional, and
international treaties and customary laws related to environmental
protection, emergency preparedness, and sustainable
development.]{.underline} The chairmanship of the council rotates every
two years among the eight member states. Russia has been at its helm
since May 2021. Importantly, [the council]{.underline} itself doesn't
make or execute laws; rather, it [provides a forum for member states to
reach multilateral agreements]{.underline}. Member states, for example,
can draft legally binding agreements that carve out shared
responsibilities for regional issues. Past agreements have centered on
search and rescue missions, marine oil pollution preparedness, and
enhanced scientific cooperation. [Agreements reached at the Arctic
Council supplement a variety of international legal and policy
frameworks, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Polar Code. Its
work is also complemented by a patchwork of other regional and
international organizations with varying scopes and focuses. Some of
these include the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, IMO, Saami Council, and
Barents Euro-Arctic Council---though, like the Arctic Council, the
latter recently suspended cooperation with Russia over its invasion of
Ukraine.]{.underline} In short, there is no one entity that bears
ultimate responsibility for Arctic governance. Relative peace in the
region has long rested on the assumption that for the eight states
wishing to preserve---and retain control of---their Arctic territories,
the benefits of cooperation outweigh its drawbacks. And in the past,
this utilitarian balance has held despite provocations. In 2007, a
Russian submarine planted the national flag on the seabed beneath the
North Pole. The act drew mild diplomatic bristling, prompting
then-Canadian Foreign Minister Peter MacKay to say, "This isn't the 15th
century. You can't go around the world and just plant flags and say,
'We're claiming this territory.'" Then-U.S. State Department
spokesperson Tom Casey dismissed the move as lacking "any legal standing
or effect on this claim." But cooperation endured. Even past
geopolitical nadirs have failed to sink Arctic cooperation. As Russia's
2014 annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea inspired waves of
Western sanctions and derailed circumpolar security efforts, the work of
the Arctic Council continued. The Arctic Council's founding document,
the Ottawa Declaration, states specifically that the council "should not
deal with matters related to military security"---a fact many analysts
agree has supported Arctic cooperation even during periods of
geopolitical strife elsewhere. This distinction has inspired multiple
Nobel Peace Prize nominations for the organization, including as
recently as this year, just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine. "[[The
Arctic Council demonstrates the need for cooperation and trust between
countries in a time where peace is threatened around Ukraine and other
regions]{.mark},"]{.underline} Norwegian parliamentarian Bard Ludvig
Thorheim told High North News of his decision, along with three others,
to nominate the council. But Arctic analysts have voiced increasing
concern over governance gaps in the region. The Arctic is warming nearly
three times faster than the global average, causing sea ice to melt, sea
levels to rise, severe weather events to increase, and fauna populations
to shrink. All this also increases shipping accessibility, which
heightens pollution and spill-related risks. A 2021 Rand Corp. report
identified three core Arctic governance gaps: limited military dialogue
and transparency, limited capacity to execute governance agreements, and
rising tensions between the growing push for global inclusivity in the
region and the interests of the Arctic states. Under the council's
structure, six Indigenous peoples' organizations serve as permanent
participants, with full consultation rights in the body's negotiation
and decision-making process, while non-Arctic states can observe the
council's activities, with a clear caveat that all official decisions
and agreements are exclusive to the eight Arctic states. Rand suggests
that, in the long term, broader multilateral engagement with both the
non-Arctic states and the region's Indigenous peoples will be imperative
to managing a broad range of conflict catalysts. These governance gaps
were identified well before the seven non-Russian permanent members of
the Arctic Council announced on March 3 their intent to boycott upcoming
council meetings and activities. Citing their belief that the "core
principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, based on
international law, have long underpinned the work of the Arctic Council,
a forum which Russia currently chairs," the states announced they would
be "temporarily pausing" participation in all council meetings,
including those of its subsidiary bodies. The timing of the pause was
explained in exceedingly vague terms, with the statement indicating it
would remain in effect "pending consideration of the necessary
modalities that can allow us to continue the Council's important work."
Speaking at a March 14 panel hosted by the Wilson Center, James DeHart,
the U.S. coordinator for the Arctic region, said the seven boycotting
states deliberately chose to say "temporarily pausing" and emphasized
that this was neither a withdrawal from the Arctic Council nor a signal
of intent to reconstitute it. "It's simply a pause in light of the
horrific events and Russia's egregious, unprovoked, completely
unnecessary war of choice against Ukraine," he said. DeHart added that
it was difficult to predict how long the pause would last given the
fluid situation on the ground in Ukraine. Russia's senior Arctic
official, Nikolay Korchunov, said [the boycott would inevitably increase
risks and challenges in the region. "[The Arctic should remain as a
territory of peace]{.mark} ... and thus, this unique format should not
be subject to the spillover effect of any extra-regional
events]{.underline}. For us, [[there is no alternative to uninterrupted
sustainable development of our Arctic territories]{.underline}]{.mark},"
he said. He added that apart from meetings with other senior Arctic
officials, council events would continue as planned, in the hope that
its activities will eventually be able to pick up where they left off
before the boycott. But it remains unclear how this would work in
practice, given the council's collaborative nature and consensus-based
decision-making process. [If there were gaps in governance before, they
have now become glaring abscesses.]{.underline} The perils of lackluster
military transparency more broadly were illustrated a month into
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when a weekslong breakdown in
communication between top U.S. and Russian military brass stoked fears
among officials and analysts that miscalculations on the battlefield
could lead to an unintended escalation between the world's two largest
nuclear powers. [[Add to that scenario the vulnerabilities of a
mineral-rich region governed by an incomprehensive patchwork of
organizations and mechanisms, and the dangers of inadequate
communication become all the more clear]{.mark}. They are only
heightened by the fact that [a breakdown at the Arctic Council could
provide strategic opportunities for non-Arctic states such as China to
expand their influence in the region.]{.mark} Russian officials have
called the boycott "regrettable," and on this, they may have a point.
[The utilitarian balance of Arctic cooperation has been thrown
off-kilter. Whether and how that balance will be restored is
unclear]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [with the already fragile regional
governance efforts at a standstill, [the potential negative consequences
extend]{.mark} far beyond the canceling of high-level council meetings
and the stifling of ongoing monitoring and research collaborations.
[From increased military activity to decreased circumpolar security
communication, and from the changing commercial realities]{.mark}
brought about by increased shipping to the opening up of mineral and
hydrocarbon wealth that comes with rising temperatures, [the region is
rife with potential catalysts for conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Strategic documents released in the past couple of years by the U.S.
Army, Air Force, Navy, and Department of Homeland Security and a spate
of recent U.S. military training exercises indicate Washington is
working overtime to shore up its Arctic defenses. And though these
strategies predate the Ukraine invasion, they demonstrate both [[the
fragility of regional peace]{.mark} and the fact that, for the United
States, the Arctic is a vital national interest. [What Russia is doing
in Ukraine is unconscionable.]{.mark} Its unprovoked violence and
flagrant disregard for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and
humanitarian law are reprehensible. It has rightly provoked outrage and
punitive actions even from organizations that bill themselves as
apolitical, such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA. Yet
[none of this changes the realities on the ground in the Arctic, which
are at once increasingly fragile and increasingly
high-stakes.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the past, the Arctic Council's
ability to remain above the geopolitical fray has bolstered reliable
cooperation even during unpredictable diplomatic times. This owes in
part to the Ottawa Declaration's clear directive on military security.
The boycott---which is also linked to broader questions of international
law---finds its factual basis in Moscow's invasion and is arguably at
odds with this directive. [Justified though their outrage toward Russia
may be, the seven other [Arctic states]{.mark} owe it not only to
themselves but to the international community to relaunch Arctic Council
activities as soon as possible]{.underline}. If doing so is too
politically costly, [the Arctic states [should]{.mark} at the very least
[work quickly to patch their region's growing governance gaps with
meaningful and substantive bilateral and multilateral
agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}. And if the Arctic Council's cohesion
prevails, perhaps its next Nobel Peace Prize nomination will pan out.

6\. Conclusions

[**Competition** and **confrontation** in the Arctic offer China and the
U.S. another **venue** for geopolitical **posturing**]{.underline}, an
extension of their relationship in other places and on other matters. In
practical terms, however, [[the Arctic]{.mark} at present [offers
**little reward** for]{.mark} the [**investment** required to]{.mark}
further **[assert]{.mark}** one's **presence** and one's
**[power]{.mark}**. U.S. **[sovereignty]{.mark}** over Alaska and its
waters [is **unquestioned**]{.mark}]{.underline}. China's icebreakers
traverse the Arctic Ocean for research. [[**Economic** activity]{.mark}
and potential [are]{.mark} largely **[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
land-based resources and locations, such as the Yamal Peninsula or
Alaska's North Slope. [Shipping activities are
**concentrated**]{.underline} along the Northeast Passage and Northern
Sea Route, mainly for transporting raw materials from the Russian Arctic
to distant markets. [[Large-scale **development**]{.mark} of fisheries,
deep-sea minerals, or new shipping lanes [is
unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline} in the near future. In other words, the
stakes are low and likely to remain so for some time to come.

[**[Cooperation]{.mark}**, on the other hand, [can provide tangible
**benefits**]{.mark} in the **short term** as well as better
**long-term** prospects]{.underline} for amicable, or at least
non-confrontational, relations in the Arctic the long term. The CAO
Fisheries Agreement created a Joint Program of Scientific Research and
Monitoring, building on existing modes of scientific cooperation that
involve China, the U.S., and other countries. All [**[shipping]{.mark}**
that connects the Pacific and the Arctic Oceans must go through the
**Bering Strait**, where good [**governance** and]{.mark} modern
[**charting** can]{.mark} help **[avoid accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that would benefit no one. In a place with little capacity for search
and rescue, mutual aid agreements involving more than Arctic coastal
states make good sense. [Small-scale [economic
**interactions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as tourism and exports from
existing fisheries, [[offer **mutual benefits**]{.mark} as well as a
pathway to second-track **diplomacy** through **greater
contact**]{.underline} between Chinese and U.S. citizens.

[What happens in the Arctic **cannot be** entirely **separated** from
what happens **elsewhere**]{.underline}. Arctic exceptionalism does not
require completely different rules of engagement, just a recognition
that there are opportunities to try different ways of interacting. [[The
**risks** of]{.mark} pursuing [a cooperative relationship]{.mark} in the
Arctic [appear]{.mark} to be **relatively [low]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[The benefits]{.mark} include **short-term gains** that [more than
**repay**]{.mark} any [investment]{.mark}, as well as the potential for
larger **long-term benefits**]{.underline} through decreased tension and
greater understanding, based on actual cooperative experience. If such
an outcome is an appealing alternative to current policy and practice,
further research in this area might consider identifying plausible
pathways (e.g., \[25\]) to achieve some version of a new Arctic
exceptionalism, or to assess the likelihood that various
actors---governments, companies, non-governmental organizations, and
others---might be willing to undertake the actions needed to shift from
confrontation to cooperation in Arctic affairs.

Finally, [despite growing concerns about **[China]{.mark}**, its
[presence]{.mark} and influence in the region [is still
**limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The predicted shipping bonanza from
China to Europe through the Arctic Ocean---the so-called Northern Sea
Route or Northeast Passage---has never materialized. Of the 314 tankers
and other commercial vessels trafficking the route in 2022, not a single
vessel sailed under the Chinese flag, although seven ships were
registered in Hong Kong. In addition, the onshore Yamal liquefied
natural gas project in the European Arctic remains China's only
large-scale investment in the region, and without access to Western
technology, China's ability to extract offshore oil and gas resources in
the region remains limited.

Moreover, [[China is **unlikely** to establish]{.mark} a significant
[**military** presence in the **Arctic**]{.mark} region]{.underline}.
China's naval [[rivalry]{.mark} with the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[in the Indo-Pacific will **pin down** most of
its]{.mark} naval [assets]{.mark} in Asia, [and Russia is]{.mark} likely
to be **very [dubious]{.mark}** [about a Chinese]{.mark} **naval
[presence]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the north, not least [because it is
**so close** to Russia's most important strategic asset, the **Northern
Fleet**]{.underline}. [Beijing is **well aware** of Moscow's **concern**
and can probably]{.underline} relate to it: During the Cold War, Chinese
leader Mao Zedong turned down Soviet overtures to build a joint naval
fleet and a series of radio stations along the Chinese coast to

### AT: Track II Diplomacy CP

The Biden administration's 2022 National Security Strategy pledged to
restore American leadership on the global stage while tacitly
criticizing the previous Trump administration's self-interested and
transactional approach to world affairs. However, when it comes to
Russian relations, neither the first Trump nor Biden administrations did
anything to rescind Obama's Kremlin ban. [[Decreased dialogue between
Washington and Moscow]{.mark} only degrades diplomacy, [exacerbates
tension]{.mark}, and increases the unknowns.]{.underline} Since the
beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, [the global
situation]{.underline} has gone from bad to worse. [It has become
particularly troubling in the Arctic where [military and commercial
activities continue to increase in scope and scale and where there are
no functioning forums---**at the official level**---enabling Washington
and Moscow to **deescalate tensions**]{.mark}. Absent a structured forum
for deescalation, [the **risk for miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation and
escalation [increase]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[The Arctic presents an opportunity for the Trump administration to
pursue pragmatic and more open engagement between Washington and
Moscow]{.underline}, specifically in the military and security space.
[Such [a forum currently exists at the Track 2 level, but **absent
official participation** from Washington and Moscow decision makers,
this forum's efforts to curtail conflict will
struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Beyond track 1 and track 2

Another opportunity to make progress in this conflicted space is to
consider the potential roles of different actors. Much academic
discussion has focused on track 1 diplomacy, or formal diplomacy,
suggesting that track 2, or informal, efforts were largely a spillover
from scientific cooperation. However, the reality has been more nuanced.
[[Sometimes projects **initiated by track 1 players** have been enacted
by track 2 actors]{.underline}]{.mark}. During the Obama era, for
example, [the US National Academy of Sciences played an active role in
mediating the intended rapprochement with Cuba]{.underline}.
[Conversely]{.underline}, [track 2 activities have led to significant
diplomatic achievements]{.underline}. The scientifically led
International Geophysical Year of 1957-58 resulted in the Antarctic
Treaty. [[Track 1 and 2 approaches are not separate, but increasingly
intertwined]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Inevitably, direct national interests will be primarily driven by the
political processes determining economic and security policy. Domestic
scientific communities strive to show their relevance to their national
funders by supporting such efforts. But at the same time, it has been
the global scientific community that has brought attention to climate
change, biodiversity loss, pandemic risks, and many other existential
threats which require concerted, collective action. In this narrowing
window of opportunities to make progress on critically important global
goals, track 2 science diplomacy may become even more necessary. For
example, the activities proposed for the 2032 International Polar Year,
which emphasizes involvement and coproduction of knowledge between a
range of Arctic stakeholders, could help to reduce diplomatic tensions
and build relationships.

A renewed emphasis on track 2, or [**[a hybrid approach utilizing both
tracks]{.underline}**, [would]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [[be
returning to a role the international science community has often played
in history]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the eighteenth century, for example,
scientists worked across conflicted nations on issues of common
interest, such as gathering measurements of the transit of Venus from
multiple sites to estimate the solar unit. But in the current context of
rapid change in science when inter-nation tensions are high, track 2
efforts could be an important tool.

Economic Drivers in Foreign Policy Discourse

[[Foreign policy]{.mark} decisions profoundly [influence
domestic]{.mark} economic [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}, which are
[[pivotal in]{.mark} domestic [elections]{.mark}. [Trade]{.mark}
agreements, [alliances, and diplomatic relations determine]{.mark} the
[flow of trade and investment]{.mark}, directly affecting a country's
financial performance]{.underline}. [[Favorable]{.mark}]{.underline}
trade [[agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[open]{.mark} new [markets,
create jobs, and boost]{.mark} [industries]{.mark},
enhancing]{.underline} overall [economic growth]{.underline}. Hence,
[incumbent governments]{.underline} frequently [highlight beneficial
economic outcomes during elections]{.underline} to demonstrate effective
governance. [Successful international trade]{.underline} negotiations
[and]{.underline} securing [foreign direct investment (FDI)]{.underline}
[are presented as achievements that promise economic stability and
growth,]{.underline} appealing to voters' aspirations for prosperity.
For instance, the Indian government's decision to bring in FDI in the
retail sector in 2012 created fissures in the ruling political
coalition.

During his tenure, [[many of]{.underline}]{.mark} former U.S. President
Donald [[Trump's]{.mark} foreign [policies]{.mark} had domestic economic
repercussions that [could have lost him reelection]{.mark}.]{.underline}
He imposed a slew of heavy [[tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark} on all major
U.S. trading partners, especially China, ostensibly to revive the
domestic manufacturing sector. U.S. tensions with
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} over the nuclear deal also worsened during
his term, as he felt that the deal was too lenient on Iran. Trump's
vehement [[opposition to multilat]{.mark}eralism]{.underline},
[skepticism of]{.underline} supporting [the liberal order and military
conflicts]{.underline} abroad, and [financial support for
NATO]{.underline} stemmed from his America First domestic political
narrative. U.S. domestic political dynamics have also historically
shaped its trade relations with China.

In South Asia, bilateral relations between India and Pakistan and
Pakistan and Bangladesh are historically adversarial (as is public
sentiment), so establishing robust trade relations is a long-standing
challenge. The economic consequences from those and other foreign policy
challenges can harm an incumbent's image, which was most vividly
witnessed in the recent Sri Lankan economic crisis. The Gotabaya
Rajapaksa administration was criticized for its foreign policy missteps,
which harmed the economy, resulting in job losses, inflation, and
decreased investor confidence. Hence, [trade disputes, sanctions, and
**[diplomatic failures provide ammunition for political
resentment]{.mark}**]{.underline} against the ruling elite.

Nationalism and Foreign Policy Posturing

National security and defense are critical issues in domestic electoral
politics, with foreign policy playing a crucial role in shaping voters'
perceptions of national leadership. [[Effective handling
of]{.underline}]{.mark} security challenges, [strategic alliances, and
**[diplomatic relations]{.mark}**]{.underline} can [**[significantly
bolster a leader's image]{.mark}** as a strong and capable protector of
the nation]{.underline}. A strong leader acting boldly in the nation's
interest against an enemy state or entity is often popularly supported.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's increasing popularity among Russians
in the wake of his 2022 invasion of Ukraine is a case in point. Also,
for instance, Trump's emphasis on nativism, anti-globalism, and
isolationism portrayed him as a leader working for the American people
and not vested global interests. He also opposed receiving migrants,
citing national security concerns, which drew further support from his
political base. In 2017, former Polish Defense Minister Antoni
Macierewicz declared protests against his government's reform initiative
as a hybrid war against Poland, alleging foreign interference in
Poland's national sovereignty.

Similarly, the 2020 U.S. presidential elections were rocked by
allegations of Russian interference. In India, responses to cross-border
terrorism and military engagements have frequently become part of the
discourse of domestic politics. Incidents such as the surgical strikes
in 2016 and the Balakot airstrike against Pakistan in 2019 were pivotal
in shaping the national security narrative within India. India's robust
response to those threats was perceived as a demonstration of strength
and resolve, which resonated with the electorate, enhancing the ruling
party's standing. The invocation of the enemy other is another example
of how foreign relations shape political narratives in democracies for
electoral mobilization. Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's
anti-U.S. political rhetoric turned Venezuela's foreign policy away from
the United States and helped Chavez build an image for himself as a bold
leader, as he forged closer ties with traditional U.S. adversaries like
Russia, China, and Cuba.

[Strong alliances and national security agreements also play a vital
role in domestic politics.]{.underline} Such [[partnerships]{.mark}
enhance]{.underline} a country's [security posture and [project]{.mark}
an image of [geopolitical significance]{.mark}.]{.underline} [For
example, India politically leverages its defense cooperation with the
United States, Russia, and other critical players to showcase the
government's commitment to national defense and bolster its
international stature]{.underline}. The U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Deal in
2006 is a prime example. Conversely, perceived weaknesses or failures in
addressing security threats can undermine public confidence.
[[Effectively managing]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[issues]{.mark} can
[elevate]{.mark} a leader's [image]{.mark}, [while failures]{.mark} can
[provide]{.mark} potent [fodder for]{.mark} political
[adversaries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Emphasizing]{.mark} cultural and historical [ties]{.mark} in foreign
policy can further [reinforce]{.mark} a strong and vibrant [national
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Diplomatic
initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark}** that celebrate shared heritage with
other countries or promote indigenous culture on the global stage [can
**[strengthen national pride]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Also, the
[[participation of]{.mark} political [leaders]{.mark} in high-level
summits can [boost]{.mark} the [domestic image]{.mark} of national
leaders, **[improving]{.mark} their [political credibility]{.mark}** at
home.]{.underline} The interplay between foreign policy, identity
politics, and nationalism is dominant in domestic politics in many
countries. For instance, the question of Sri Lankan Tamils has long
impacted the foreign policy and domestic politics of both Sri Lanka and
India. Leaders adept at harnessing nationalist or identitarian
sentiments through foreign policy decisions can significantly bolster
their electoral appeal and shape the political landscape in their favor.

By electing Donald Trump as president and giving [[the Republican
Party]{.underline}]{.mark} control in both the U.S. House of
Representatives and Senate, U.S. voters [[have given
the]{.underline}]{.mark} future [[Trump administration a rare
opportunity to advance the president's policies]{.underline}]{.mark} and
vision for the United States. Among many other foreign policy topics,
Trump's return to the White House will have a significant effect on U.S.
policies in the two very different polar regions: the Arctic and the
Antarctic. To project where policy on the polar regions may go, one can
look to his first administration, the 2024 Republican Party presidential
platform, Project 2025, and Trump's presidential campaign, but those
remain just signals until senior officials are selected and the new
administration determines its priorities. What follows are some
forecasts about the next Trump administration's polar policies and
recommendations about how to achieve the goals that got him elected.
U.S. Policies on Polar Regions By virtue of Alaska, approximately 15
percent of the Arctic is U.S. territory, which makes the Arctic both a
domestic and foreign policy topic with competing interests to balance.
[[In 2022]{.underline}]{.mark}, after a multi-year, inclusive
interagency process, [[the United States released its National Strategy
for the Arctic Region]{.underline}]{.mark}, which replaced the previous
version issued in 2013. The goal of [[the new strategy is "an Arctic
region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and
**cooperative."**]{.underline}]{.mark} It lists [[four pillars to
achieve this goa]{.underline}]{.mark}l---security, [[climate change and
environmental protection]{.underline}]{.mark}, sustainable economic
development, [[and international cooperation and

#### Republicans will stick with Trump on foreign policy -- they're afraid of retaliation and executive supremacy overwhelms -- also only the senate is mixed and BBB already passed there

**Harnik 25** (Andrew Harnik, 1-30-2025, \"Congress Can Check the
President on Foreign Policy---Even Under Trump\", Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace,
https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/01/trump-congress-foreign-policy-check?lang=en)
-- doa: 7/3/25, MoState JG

President Donald [[Trump]{.mark} has]{.underline} recently
[[floated]{.underline}]{.mark} a series of [highly
[unconventional]{.mark} foreign policy [ideas]{.mark}]{.underline}, from
annexing Greenland and retaking the Panama Canal, to imposing hefty
tariffs on imports from every country in the world, to using the
military to deport more than 10 million undocumented immigrants. He also
has a track record of praising authoritarian leaders, seeking to gut the
State Department, and questioning whether he would uphold the U.S.
security commitment to NATO.

To what extent can the U.S. Congress serve as a check on Trump's most
disruptive foreign policy instincts?

[With the Republican Party in control of the House of Representatives
and Senate, the [odds of]{.mark} wide-ranging congressional
[pushback]{.mark} against Trump [appear slim]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, there will likely be important exceptions as some
Republican lawmakers join with Democratic counterparts to try to
maintain guardrails around U.S. foreign policy. These guardrails could
include the preservation of security alliances, rejection of territorial
conquest, and protection of the budget for foreign aid. In doing so,
they could soften the edges of Trump's America First agenda and limit
the chaos that it threatens to create.

[[During Trump's first term]{.mark} as president, [influential]{.mark}
congressional [Republicans cooperated with Democrats]{.mark} to protect
some of these guardrails.]{.underline} For example, when Trump proposed
slashing U.S. spending on diplomacy and foreign assistance by one-third,
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy,
along with their counterparts in the House, used their committee
leadership positions to maintain the international affairs budget at a
roughly constant level. Similarly, when Trump questioned the value of
NATO, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and then-Speaker of
the House Paul Ryan backed bipartisan resolutions reiterating U.S.
support for the alliance. Congress further strengthened this NATO
guardrail in 2023 with a bipartisan measure introduced by Democratic
Senator Tim Kaine and Republican Senator Marco Rubio that prohibits the
president from withdrawing from NATO without congressional assent. Rubio
is, of course, now Trump's secretary of state.

Democrats and Republicans have also worked together to protect the U.S.
security commitment to South Korea. During his first term, Trump's
attempt at dealmaking with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and pressure
on South Korea to spend more on its own defense generated concerns that
he might abandon Seoul. Members of the armed services committees
responded by adding to annual defense legislation a provision that
constrained the president's authority to reduce U.S. troop levels on the
Korean Peninsula.

More recently, Congress included in fiscal year 2025 defense legislation
a provision calling on the United States to maintain 28,500 troops in
South Korea and affirming America's extended deterrence commitment to
the ally. Republicans and Democrats have been able to reach agreement on
these measures and approve them without controversy because there
remains strong support for alliances across the aisle. A 2024 survey of
foreign policy opinion leaders by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs
found that 71 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats think
alliances benefit both the United States and our allies.

[**[Compared to Trump's first term, a greater share]{.mark}** of
Republicans in Congress **[now identify with]{.mark}** Trump's Make
America Great Again (**[MAGA]{.mark}**) movement and follow his lead
across the board.]{.underline} After Trump suggested acquiring Greenland
and the Panama Canal, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, now led by
MAGA-aligned Republican Brian Mast, posted on X, "Our country was built
by warriors and explorers. We tamed the West, won two World Wars, and
were the first to plant our flag on the moon. President Trump has the
biggest dreams for America and it's un-American to be afraid of big
dreams." [[Trump]{.mark} also successfully [lobbied]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Speaker of the House Mike Johnson [to change]{.mark} the
[leadership]{.mark} of the House Intelligence Committee]{.underline} at
the start of this Congress, replacing Mike Turner, a hawk who has
challenged Trump on Ukraine policy and some intelligence issues, [with
Mike Crawford, a consistently staunch defender of Trump who has opposed
further U.S. aid to Ukraine.]{.underline}

While [[most House Republicans will]{.mark} act as
**[cheer]{.mark}**leaders [for Trump]{.mark} on foreign
policy,]{.underline} the [story will be more mixed in the
Senate]{.underline}. Traditional Reaganites, who value U.S. military
primacy, moral leadership, and the robust use of all instruments of
national power, from covert action to foreign aid, remain in key
positions of leadership in the upper chamber. John Thune, the new
Republican Senate majority leader, has been a consistent supporter of
alliances as well as funding for diplomacy and foreign assistance.
Senators Roger Wicker, McConnell, and Graham, who also fall squarely in
the Reaganite tradition, are serving, respectively, as the chairmen of
the Armed Services Committee and of the appropriations subcommittees for
military and civilian foreign policy spending. Strikingly, after
agreeing to step down as the Senate Republican leader last year,
[McConnell noted]{.underline} that he planned to devote his remaining
two years in the Senate to securing "U.S. leadership and primacy" and
protecting the Senate's institutional independence. In a recent Foreign
Affairs article, he also argued that "[the United States cannot neglect
the role of foreign aid]{.underline}" in advancing U.S. security---a
striking contrast to an executive order issued by Trump on the second
day of his new term that placed a ninety-day freeze on nearly all
foreign aid spending.

To be sure, [on many foreign policy issues, there will not be much
daylight between Trump and Republican senators. Republicans are
united]{.underline} in favoring the placement of heavy economic pressure
on China, Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela; strong support for Israel;
hardening the border with Mexico; and the removal of many policies
designed to address climate change. Moreover, on some of these issues,
such as the application of pressure against China and the continuation
of military aid for Israel, many Democrats are on the same page as their
Republican colleagues.

But on some other issues, intraparty fractures within the Republican
Party may be pronounced. While most Republicans in Congress are willing
to give Trump considerable leeway to negotiate an agreement to end the
Russia-Ukraine war, pro-Ukraine Republicans, such as Thune, McConnell,
Wicker, and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, may
push back against Trump if he moves to reach a deal with Russian
President Vladimir Putin that they think does not adequately protect
Ukraine. Consider that, as recently as last April, thirty-one Senate
Republicans and 101 House Republicans joined forty-eight Senate
Democrats and 210 House Democrats in voting to approve \$61 billion in
new military aid for Ukraine---even though Trump had opposed further
U.S. assistance to the country.

Of course, [**[most]{.mark} Republicans in Congress [are reluctant to
challenge Trump in]{.mark} a [public]{.mark} way**, [fearful]{.mark} of
how [he might retaliate]{.mark} against them politically]{.underline} by
[backing Republican primary challengers when they stand for
reelection]{.underline}. But some senior Republicans---particularly ones
who maintain a strong constituency separate from the MAGA movement,
possess an independent streak, or will not be running for
reelection---may be willing to go further than the rest of the flock.

For example, if Trump seems to be abandoning Ukraine, don't be surprised
to see McConnell denouncing the president's policy on the Senate floor.
McConnell and Wicker could also use their powerful committee positions
to try to ensure continued U.S. support for Ukraine by appropriating
further military aid for the country or legislating a prohibition on
U.S. recognition of Russian control of occupied Ukrainian territory
unless Ukraine agrees to it. Even if such legislative efforts are
unsuccessful in the face of Trump's opposition, just the prospect of
having his policy publicly challenged by high-profile Republicans might
cause him to negotiate with Putin differently. Indeed, Trump's recent
tough-sounding rhetoric toward Putin may be motivated in part by a
desire to insulate himself from the potential criticism that he
accommodated the Russian president too much.

On a related transatlantic issue, Trump may be deterred from pulling out
of NATO by the 2023 law that prohibits U.S withdrawal from the alliance
without congressional approval of the step. Congress could further
strengthen the U.S. commitment to European allies by prohibiting the
president from reducing the number of U.S. troops deployed to NATO
countries below a certain number without Congress having an opportunity
to weigh in on the proposed change. To be sure, Trump could still
greatly weaken U.S.-NATO relations in other ways---for instance, by
refusing to send a representative to NATO meetings---but legislative
constraints could limit the long-term damage to the alliance.

Trump may also face pushback from both parties in Congress if he pursues
the more aggressive pieces of his protectionist trade agenda. He has
proposed imposing a tariff of 10 to 20 percent on all imported goods, as
well as large additional tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, Canada,
and countries that undermine the U.S. dollar's status as a global
reserve currency. In response to some of these proposals, Republican
Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, which relies heavily on
agricultural exports, commented in November, "Tariffs have a place, but
there is also the other side, which is: what about the repercussions of
\[countries\] putting tariffs in a retaliatory method on some of our
items as well?" If Trump goes beyond the limited use of tariffs to
impose levies in a manner that will create major economic losses to
important U.S. constituencies, Republicans and Democrats representing
those constituencies could join together to advance legislation that
would give Congress a greater say in tariff decisions---for instance, by
giving Congress an opportunity to endorse or reject certain proposed
tariffs before they go into effect. Whether such a legislative effort
succeeds may depend on whether Republicans representing pro-trade
agricultural constituencies are able to bring other Republicans on
board.

Similarly, while most Republicans back Trump's plans to seal the border
and deport undocumented immigrants, some GOP lawmakers will oppose any
moves to deploy the military to round people up. In November, Republican
Senator Rand Paul stated, "I will not support and will not vote to use
the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image." Republicans
and Democrats concerned about the potential use of the military for
deporting immigrants could advance legislation clarifying that the 1807
Insurrection Act does not authorize the president to use the military
for the purpose of enforcing immigration laws.

Republicans who oppose military interventionism could also join with
Democrats to constrain the president from using force against Panama or
Greenland. In 2020, when members of Congress grew concerned that Trump
might take military action against Iran, the House and Senate passed a
resolution, with backing from eight Senate Republicans and six House
Republicans as well as nearly all Democrats, that prohibited the use of
force against Iran unless Congress authorized it. Although Trump vetoed
the resolution, it signaled that Congress would not be behind the
president if he chose to pursue war, and this may have dissuaded him
from carrying out military action. In a similar way, members of Congress
in both parties who oppose interventionism or consider it important to
protect Congress's constitutional war powers authority, such as Kaine
and Republican Senator Todd Young, could advance legislation that
prohibits the use of force against Panama or Greenland without
congressional approval. In one sign of congressional opposition to
annexing Greenland, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski recently issued a
joint statement with a Danish member of Parliament stating that
Greenland is "an ally, not an asset."

None of this is to say that Congress is going to take over the reins of
U.S. foreign policy. To the contrary, [[the president will
remain]{.mark} the [dominant]{.mark} actor [in foreign affairs,
continuing a]{.mark} decadeslong [trend of growing executive
power]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it will remain difficult on many issues
for Congress to overcome its internal divisions. But Congress is still
capable of maintaining some guardrails around foreign policy. Most
importantly, some Republican lawmakers may still be willing to join with
Democrats in efforts to preserve core elements of internationalism, and
those efforts could temper Trump's foreign policy in important ways.

#### International Science Cooperation popular -- key to military and economic growth 

**SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY COORDINATION**

Cooperation" February 03, **2024**

At the 2023 National Medal of Science and National Medal of Technology
and Innovation Awards, President Biden said, "...the greatness of a
country is measured not only by the size of its economy or the strength
of its military. [[The strength of the nation]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[measured by the boldness of its
science]{.underline}]{.mark}, the quality of its research, and the
progress it helps bring forth for not only the country but the whole
world."2 By bringing together a wide range of viewpoints and resources
that lead to scientific discoveries and technological innovations,
[[international science and technology]{.underline}]{.mark} (S&T)
[[cooperation generates vital economic, political, societal, national
security, development, and diplomatic benefits]{.underline}]{.mark} for
both the United States and the world. In October 2022, White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Director Arati Prabhakar
highlighted a number of unsolved challenges, including those with a
clear global nexus: health, climate, and competitive industries.3 All
can benefit from facilities, expertise, and partners from outside the
United States, and through [[international
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} the world [[can mobilize the
scientific capacity needed]{.underline}]{.mark} to address these
challenges. [[International S&T cooperation has been a pillar of U.S.
foreign policy and national security]{.underline}]{.mark} since the end
of World War II, and it is at risk of deteriorating at a time when it is
more important than ever. President Biden, Secretary of State Blinken,
and National Security Advisor Sullivan have all described that the world
is at an historic inflection point: as the post-Cold War era comes to an
end, international competition to define what comes next has grown
increasingly fierce. 4,5,6 The economic and national security of the
United States calls for championing research, discovery, technology, and
innovation, which in turn requires "...maintain\[ing\] and
increase\[ing\] international cooperation on shared challenges even in
an age of greater inter-state competition."7

#### Plan expands influence in the Arctic with Russia -- that is popular with Trump

A significant geopolitical shift in Arctic energy investments is
unfolding, as [[Russia and the United States discussed possible
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} on energy projects [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} at a meeting in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, a top
Russian negotiator told POLITICO. Kirill Dmitriev, who heads the
state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said the economic
conversations had been about broad strokes, but that the two sides had
discussed some "specific areas of cooperation." "It was more a general
discussion --- maybe joint projects in the Arctic. [[We specifically
discussed the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}," Dmitriev said by phone as he
boarded a flight home after the talks in Riyadh. This development could
have long-term implications for Arctic energy, geopolitics, and
international cooperation in the region. As is already widely known,
[[Republican]{.underline}]{.mark} US President Donald J. [[Trump aims to
expand US influence in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. His last move
was against Greenland, wanting to take it from Denmark\'s hands,
willingly or not, for a second time.
