### Inherency

#### Arctic is diesel dependent despite local preferences for renewables

The [[**Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark} is defined by [[harsh weather,
remote communities and unique environmental
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}. These challenges
[[make]{.underline}]{.mark} access to reliable and [[affordable energy
difficult, forcing many]{.underline}]{.mark} communities [[to **depend**
on costly]{.underline}]{.mark} and environmentally [[harmful **imported
diesel** fuel. Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, the resilience and ingenuity of
[[Arctic communities]{.underline}]{.mark} and Indigenous Peoples are
equally remarkable. They're turning to local renewable resources to meet
their energy needs. By adopting clean energy solutions, they [[**aim**
to reduce fossil fuel reliance]{.underline}]{.mark}, lower costs and
minimize environmental impacts.

### 1AC -- Plan

#### The United States federal government should develop renewable energy projects in the Arctic through financial support to provide sustainable power for Arctic communities. 

### Solvency

#### Financial support enables renewable transition through loans, feed in tariffs & net metering

3.6.1 Financial Instruments

[[**Financial support** for renewable]{.underline}]{.mark} energy
projects [[could help]{.underline}]{.mark} both Nukissiorfiit and/or
[[community leaders overcome]{.underline}]{.mark} high [[initial
cost]{.underline}]{.mark} barriers. The high capital costs of new
capacity and a lack of human capacity for grant writing are some of
[[the most considerable barriers to]{.underline}]{.mark} initiating
small-scale [[renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark} projects in
Greenland.

**[[Loans]{.underline}]{.mark}** provided by the government or
state-owned banks [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} described as some of [[the
most important]{.underline}]{.mark} financial instruments to support
community energy projects \[30\]; \[136\]. Government loans could be
provided to community members, third-party energy developers, or the
utility for implementing renewable energy into non-hydro communities at
a subsidized interest rate. Our analysis shows how [[lower interest
rates facilitate high renewable integration]{.underline}]{.mark} and
positive outcomes for potential IPP schemes by lowering renewable LCOEs.
A review of governance instruments that support Arctic community energy
projects asserts that [[mixed funding]{.underline}]{.mark} that includes
a minimal level of investment by the community [[can
support]{.mark}]{.underline} community engagement and the [[long-term
viability]{.underline}]{.mark} of energy projects \[30\].

**[[Feed-in tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([FITs]{.underline}) have
also historically been an important financial mechanism for supporting
community renewable energy projects. In a FIT scheme, the renewable
generator is guaranteed a price for the electricity they supply in a
long-term contract. Considering Nukissiorfiit always produces
electricity at a loss in Qaanaaq, a FIT with a communitybased renewable
generator could help [[reduce losses]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example,
if Nukissiorfiit buys renewable energy from the community at DKk 2/kWh
(just above the retail rate), they save DKK 3/kWh, and the
community-based generator can earn [[above the]{.underline}]{.mark}
levelized cost of energy or the [[break-even price]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Feed-in tariffs provide security in both income and grid access, [[which
can]{.underline}]{.mark} help the community generator secure loans with
lower interest rates or attract private investors \[30\]. A FIT with a
reasonable purchase rate can help [[incentivize]{.underline}]{.mark} a
greater number of [[renewable scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} for a
community generator under more economic conditions. If, for example, the
purchase rate is agreed on as DKK 2/kWh, several more scenarios listed
in Table 3.2 become feasible, even if discount rates are high.

The current **[[net-metering incentives]{.underline}]{.mark}** provided
by Nukissiorfiit incentivize self-suppliers and can effectively [[help
residents reduce electricity cost burdens. However, participation is
lacking]{.underline}]{.mark}, likely [[due to upfront
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Restructuring
incentives]{.underline}]{.mark} to help self-suppliers purchase solar
panels upfront [[could be]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[[effective]{.underline}]{.mark} tool [[for increasing
participation]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, for a self-supplier
applying for a 2-kW array in Qaanaaq, Nukissiorfiit can estimate the
annual cost savings from diesel that this would provide. Nukissiorfiit
then may provide the self-supplier with an advance to help purchase the
panels equal to one or more years of fuel cost savings. The
self-supplier will still benefit by reducing electric costs and earning
a small profit on excess energy transferred back to Nukissiorfiit.
Nukissiorfiit will still benefit because the self-supplier will be
active for the lifetime of the panels, which will benefit them far
beyond the advance paid.

Successful financial instruments for community projects should have
special considerations for the upfront costs of capital in remote
communities, grid connection and metering needs as outlined by the
utility, and distribution or transmission infrastructure updates.

#### Targeted funding for US microgrid models can solve throughout the arctic

Lessons From Alaska's Wind Microgrids

[[Alaska's]{.underline}]{.mark} experience with wind energy offers
valuable insights into how [[small, isolated energy systems can
successfully integrate renewables]{.underline}]{.mark}, even in
challenging environments. [[Unlike large]{.underline}]{.mark},
interconnected [[grids that]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[balance
variability]{.underline}]{.mark} through regional [[transmission
networks]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Alaska's
**microgrid**]{.underline}]{.mark}-dominant [[system
required]{.underline}]{.mark} a different approach, one driven by
technological innovation, [[a willingness to experiment, and policy
**adaptation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[lessons]{.underline}]{.mark}
learned [[from Alaska's transition are **highly
relevant**]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[for
**other**]{.underline}]{.mark} remote or [[**islanded grids** but
also]{.underline}]{.mark} for [[policy makers]{.underline}]{.mark} and
researchers studying energy transitions in difficult-to-electrify
regions.

A critical takeaway from Alaska's wind deployment is the importance of
sustained institutional commitment. While many rural utilities in the
Lower 48 were hesitant to experiment with nonconventional generation
sources, Alaska's [[cooperative utilities]{.underline}]{.mark},
particularly AVEC and KEA, [[were willing to take on technical and
financial risk]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite several early setbacks, the
utilities persisted, refining their approaches and developing workable
solutions through iterative learning. These efforts continue today, with
utilities like KEA and AVEC now deploying larger turbines,
interconnecting communities, and [[incorporating]{.underline}]{.mark}
small scale energy storage in what AVEC calls a
[[grid-bridging]{.underline}]{.mark} system to enable diesel-off
operation. These advancements have led [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
remarkable achievements, such as in the community of St. Mary's, where
[[diesel displacement near]{.underline}]{.mark}ed
[[40%]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2023.

Another key lesson is that market-driven wind
[[adoption]{.underline}]{.mark} in remote regions [[is challenging
without policy interventions to reduce **upfront**
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Programs like the [[REF played a **pivotal**
role]{.underline}]{.mark} in bridging financial gaps, [[ensuring that
promising projects were not abandoned]{.underline}]{.mark} due to
prohibitive capital costs. [[Without **targeted
funding**]{.underline}]{.mark} sources, many wind
[[projects]{.underline}]{.mark} in rural Alaska [[would have remained
financially unviable]{.underline}]{.mark}, underscoring the need for
government and institutional support in scaling renewable energy in
high-cost environments.

Perhaps most significantly, Alaska's wind energy expansion challenges
the assumption that geographic isolation and a small market size
preclude leadership in innovation. With fewer institutional barriers and
greater flexibility to experiment, [[Alaska's utilities became **working
laboratories** for wind--diesel systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many
operational lessons from Alaska projects are now being [[applied in
**other Arctic and remote grid contexts**]{.underline}]{.mark},
including Greenland and northern Canada.

#### Arctic solutions key to global mitigation

Marja Helena **Sivonen**, 20**25** **SYKE** Finnish Environment

Social Sciences, & Paula Kivimaa - SPRU, University of Sussex

<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629624004328>
(ermo-MSDI, acc 6-22-2025)

Climate change is also one key factor in thinking about the scales in
which the Finnish and Norwegian Arctic issues are discussed in the data.
[[While the negative impacts of climate change are
**global**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the local population in the North
have not been part of the problem, [[the **solutions**
to]{.underline}]{.mark} (at least) European [[climate change
**mitigation** via energy transition are expected to **come from the
Arctic** air, sea and land]{.underline}]{.mark}. Historically this has
been dramatic, and current "green transition" is feared to have
(re)colonial traits \[8\]. [[Local people]{.underline}]{.mark},
politicians, activists, entrepreneurs, and civil officials [[are in
**constant parallel to the global**]{.underline}]{.mark}, national, and
local. Lack of resources, time and leverage on these levels does not
support sustainable development overall.

### 1AC -- Advantage -- Climate

#### Melting ice and increased shipping are creating a destructive feedback loop amplified by black carbon; the Arctic is especially vulnerable 

**Liu 24** (Huirong Liu and Zhengkai Mao, School of Law, Ocean
University of China; Zhijun Zhang, Institute of Marine Development,
Ocean University of China; 9-25-2024, \"From melting ice to green
shipping: navigating emission reduction challenges in Arctic shipping in
the context of climate change\", Front. Environ. Sci. 12:1462623.,
https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623) -- DOA: 6/3/2025, MoState JG

3.1 The Arctic shipping--climate change nexus: understanding the
feedback loop of increased maritime activity and accelerated warming

The [**[escalating]{.mark}** levels of greenhouse gas
**[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, primarily [carbon
dioxide,]{.underline} have been [unequivocally identified as a major
**[drive]{.mark}**r of global **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([UN,
2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623/full#B56)).
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [(IPCC]{.underline}) has
[conducted comprehensive research on the far-reaching consequences of
greenhouse gas emissions on the atmosphere and global
warming]{.underline}. From 1984 to 2021, the [[concentration of carbon
dioxide in the Arctic]{.mark} atmosphere [exhibited a]{.mark} steady and
[consistent upward trend,]{.mark}]{.underline} with the annual average
concentration being slightly higher than the global average ([Figure
2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623/full#F2)).
According to the IPCC's projections, the [planet is likely to experience
a 1.8°C--4°C increase in global temperatures by 2100, which could lead
to a 22%--33% decline in Arctic sea ice coverage]{.underline} ([IPCC,
2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623/full#B28)).
This [[dramatic warming]{.mark} trend is expected to have multifaceted
[impacts]{.mark} on the planet, **[underscoring]{.mark} the [urgent need
for mitigative measures]{.mark} to curb emissions and mitigate the
effects of climate change.**]{.underline}

[**[International shipping]{.mark}** [accounts for]{.mark} 80%--[90% of
global trade volume]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[serving as
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [primary mode of international trade and a
[**crucial** link in]{.mark} global [economic
connectivity]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Mao et al.,
2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623/full#B44)).
[However]{.underline}, the [increasing shipping activities are having
negative impacts on the global climate]{.underline}. According to IMO
statistics, the greenhouse gas emissions of total shipping
(international, domestic, and fishing) have increased from 977 million
tons in 2012 to 1,076 million tons in 2018 (9.6% increase). In 2012, 962
million tons were CO~2~ emissions, while in 2018, this amount grew 9.3%
to 1,056 million tons of CO~2~ emissions. The [[share of shipping
emissions]{.mark} in global anthropogenic emissions has
[increased]{.mark}]{.underline} from 2.76% in 2012 [to 2.89% in
2018]{.underline} ([IMO,
2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623/full#B24)).
The [near-surface annual average [temperature in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[exhibited a]{.mark} striking [upward
trend]{.mark}]{.underline} between [1979 and 2022]{.underline}, [[with a
pronounced warming rate]{.mark} of 0.67°C per decade]{.underline}.
Notably, [**this rate is [3.7 times higher than the global
average]{.mark}, [underscoring]{.mark} the Arctic's exceptional
[vulnerability]{.mark}** to the impacts of global warming]{.underline}
([China Meteorological Administration,
2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623/full#B11)).
The **[[increase in Arctic shipping]{.mark} activities]{.underline} [is
expected to [significantly intensify climate warming]{.mark} in the
Arctic region]{.underline}**. Results indicate that under the BAU
scenario, the overall shipping CO~2~ emission on the Northern Sea Route
by 2050 will be over 5.5 million tons, which is 1.76 times of the
emission level in 2020. [This might [form]{.mark} a [**reinforcement
feedback** that]{.mark} a continuous [melting Arctic]{.mark} would
[attract more ships]{.mark} with a better navigability [that]{.mark}
might [generate more]{.mark} [shipping]{.mark}-caused GHG
[emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This reinforcement [feedback]{.mark}
system [would harm the Arctic]{.mark} regional [ecosystem
severely]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Jing et al.,
2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623/full#B30)).

Furthermore, the [[extreme cold]{.underline}]{.mark} [weather conditions
in the Arctic region]{.underline} [[exacerbate]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[incomplete combustion of fuel]{.mark},]{.underline} particularly heavy
fuel oil, during ship navigation, [[leading to]{.mark} the [deposition
of black carbon]{.mark} particles on ice and snow]{.underline}. As the
second most significant contributor to global warming after CO~2~,
**[[black carbon]{.underline}]{.mark}** [plays a [crucial]{.mark} role
[in accelerating climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} When
black carbon particles settle on snow and ice, [they [trigger a
cascade]{.mark} of effects, including the **[acceleration of
melting]{.mark}** on illuminated surfaces and a **[reduction in
albedo]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This, in turn, [leads to the [increased
absorption of solar radiation, causing heat to penetrate deeper]{.mark}
into the ocean and soil [and]{.mark} ultimately [amplifying]{.mark} the
[warming]{.mark} trend in the Arctic region]{.underline} ([Liu,
2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623/full#B39)).
According to research conducted by the International Council on Clean
Transportation (ICCT), 1% of black carbon is emitted at 60°N latitude
and above. Although black carbon emitted at all latitudes has a climate
warming effect, **[[black carbon emitted in the Arctic has a nearly five
times greater]{.mark} Arctic surface [warming effect]{.mark} than black
carbon emitted in mid latitudes]{.underline}**. However, 11% of black
carbon is emitted from ships in the Arctic Front (40°N latitude and
above), an area where black carbon emissions may have a direct impact on
the Arctic through atmospheric transport ([International Council on
Clean Transportation,
2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623/full#B25)).
Currently, the [shipping]{.underline} industry [generates]{.underline}
approximately [42 million tons of carbon dioxide and 4 million tons of
black carbon annually.]{.underline} The [[effects
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the comparatively [[small amount of black
carbon]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[add considerably to]{.mark} those of
[carbon dioxide from ships]{.mark} in the Arctic region]{.underline}.
[[One ton]{.mark} of black carbon emitted in the Arctic region [produces
a warming effect equivalent to]{.mark} 4,000--[7,000 tons of carbon
dioxide]{.mark} over a short-term period of approximately 20
years]{.underline} ([Maheshwar,
2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1462623/full#B43)).

[Although Arctic shipping routes offer the benefit of shorter distances
compared to traditional routes,]{.underline} the [growing number of
vessels navigating these routes is having a profound impact on the
Arctic climate.]{.underline} The [region's unique environmental
[**vulnerability** and]{.mark} the potent snow **[albedo
effect]{.mark}** of black carbon emissions from shipping activities are
likely to **[offset]{.mark}** the global **climate change
[benefits]{.mark} gained [from]{.mark} reduced emissions resulting from
[shorter voyages]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### The Arctic is key to climate, biodiversity and food security 

**Baines 24** (Marlow Baines, 2019 Youth Director for the nonprofit
Earth Guardians, where she led local and international campaigns. In
2022, she directed Earth Guardians' Choose Action Now campaign, with 95
actions in 25 countries. 7-17-2024, \"The Arctic\'s Role in Global
Climate: Why Protecting It Matters\", Global Choices,
https://globalchoices.org/the-arctics-role-in-global-climate-why-protecting-it-matters/)
-- MoState JG

At Global Choices, we are focused on protecting the Central Arctic
Ocean, but why? [[The Arctic Ocean plays a crucial role in global
climate regulation and]{.mark} the overall health of [marine
ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [unique and fragile environment is
not just a remote, icy wilderness---it is a vital component of our
planet's climate system [and has **profound effects on the entire
globe**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

[One of the most important functions of [Arctic sea ice]{.mark} is that
it serves as a bright shield that [reflects]{.mark} the sun's
[heat]{.mark} and radiation,]{.underline} a process [[known as
the]{.underline} **[albedo effect]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The white
surface of the ice [reflects a significant portion of the sun's energy
back into space,]{.underline} [[helping to keep the planet
cool]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, [[as]{.mark} global [temperatures
rise]{.mark}, Arctic sea [ice is melting]{.mark} at an alarming
rate.]{.underline} [As more ocean and land are exposed, the Earth
becomes darker, [absorbing]{.mark} the [heat and **accelerating the
ice-albedo feedback loop**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark}
**[results in even more]{.mark} warming and more [ice melt]{.mark}** in
a vicious cycle [that amplifies global climate
change.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The **[loss of Arctic sea ice]{.mark}** due to climate change [has
far-reaching consequences for ocean **currents, weather patterns, and
sea levels**]{.mark} worldwide]{.underline}. [The Arctic acts as a
global thermostat, [influencing]{.mark} major [oceanic and atmospheric
circulation]{.mark} patterns.]{.underline} The [[melting]{.mark} ice
[disrupts]{.mark} the delicate [balance]{.mark} of these systems,
**[leading to extreme weather]{.mark}** events such as severe storms,
heatwaves, and altered precipitation patterns **[far beyond the
Arctic]{.mark} region**.]{.underline}

Additionally, the [[influx of freshwater from melting ice]{.mark} into
the ocean affects the salinity and density of seawater]{.underline},
which in turn [[impacts]{.mark} the [thermohaline circulation]{.mark}, a
critical component of global ocean currents.]{.underline} These
[currents regulate climate by distributing heat around the planet, and
any disruption can [lead to unpredictable and]{.mark} potentially
[catastrophic climate shifts]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [the Arctic is home to unique and diverse marine ecosystems
that are adapted to the cold, ice-covered environment.]{.underline} The
[[loss of sea ice threatens]{.mark} the [survival of]{.mark} many
[species]{.mark}, from microscopic [plankton to]{.mark} iconic animals
like polar [bears and seals]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [**[These
changes]{.mark}** not only [endanger]{.mark} Arctic wildlife but also
**have implications for [global biodiversity]{.mark}** and the health of
marine food webs.]{.underline}

This situation can no longer be viewed as solely an Arctic States issue.
It is now understood that '[what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in
the Arctic]{.underline},' and that the [Arctic ice melt has critical
worldwide implications.]{.underline} The
[interconnectedness]{.underline} of our planet [means that [changes in
the Arctic]{.mark} have [ripple]{.mark} effects that touch all corners
of the Earth, **[impacting ag]{.mark}riculture, [fisheries]{.mark},
coastal communities, [and]{.mark} overall [global]{.mark}
[security]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

As a result, leaders and civil society must assume global responsibility
to protect and safeguard the Central Arctic Ocean Ice Shield (CAOIS) as
a natural resource that is crucial to ensure planetary and human health
and well-being, as well as for scientific research. [The [Arctic]{.mark}
provides invaluable opportunities for scientific discovery and
understanding of climate processes, **making its [preservation vital
for]{.mark}** advancing our knowledge and [**developing effective
strategies to combat climate change**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The urgency to act has never been greater. International cooperation and
bold, decisive action are essential to halt the degradation of the
Arctic and to implement sustainable practices that will protect this
critical region for future generations. At Global Choices, we advocate
for policies and initiatives that prioritize the protection of the
Arctic, recognizing that safeguarding this region is imperative for the
overall health of our planet.

#### Absent mitigation, [extinction]{.underline}\-\--catastrophic [changes]{.underline} turn the planet into a [hothouse]{.underline} and push the [earth]{.underline} beyond its [limits]{.underline}.

**[Torres 23]{.smallcaps}** \[Emile P (Phillip John), a philosopher and

humanity. They have published on a wide range of topics, including
machine superintelligence, emerging technologies, and religious
eschatology, as well as the history and ethics of human extinction.

Hence, although the "balance of nature" paradigm is now widely rejected,
many [leading scientists do believe that large-scale natural
[systems]{.mark} on Earth are in some sense delicately bal-
anced]{.underline}. These [systems change over time---they are
inherently dynamic rather than static---but sudden perturbations, on
geological timescales, can [nudge]{.mark} them [beyond]{.mark} certain
critical [thresh-olds]{.mark}, thus [resulting in]{.mark} abrupt,
[catastrophic changes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, [the ideas of
tipping points, critical thresholds, and planetary boundaries gesture at
a revised version of the "balance of na-ture" kill
mechanism]{.underline} that Carson thrust into the forefront of the
public consciousness many decades ago: if humanity trespasses one or
more system boundaries, the effects could be drastic, devastating, and
possibly irreversible (at least on timescales meaningful to
civilization). At the extreme, positive feedback loops could initiate a
runaway greenhouse effect that transmogrifies Earth into a hellish
cauldron like our planetary neighbor Venus, although current scientific
think-ing suggests that this is very unlikely. However, [scientists have
recently proposed that human-induced [changes]{.mark} in the environment
could [push Earth into a]{.mark} "[hothouse]{.mark}" state]{.underline},
after [which cli-mate mitigation efforts like CO2 emissions reductions
will have little effect on the physical con-ditions of
Earth]{.underline}. As Will Steffen, Johan Rockström, Katherine
Richardson, Timothy Lenton, and others explain, [humanity faces
a]{.underline} [risk]{.underline} that [self-reinforcing
[feedbacks]{.mark} could [push]{.mark} the [Earth]{.mark} System [toward
a]{.mark} plane-tary [threshold]{.mark} that]{.underline}, [if crossed,
could prevent stabilization of the climate at inter-mediate temperature
rises and [cause]{.mark} continued warming]{.underline} [on
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[Hothouse Earth]{.underline}]{.mark}" [pathway
even [as]{.mark} human [emissions are reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Crossing the threshold would]{.mark} [lead to]{.mark} a much
[higher]{.mark} global average [temperature]{.mark} than any
interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels
significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene]{.underline}. 654

In other words, [[climate change poses a risk to humanity]{.mark} not
just because [it will cause]{.mark} more [extreme weather]{.mark}
events, [food supply disruptions]{.mark}, [megadroughts]{.mark},
devastating [heatwaves]{.mark}]{.underline} (some ex-ceeding the 95
degree F threshold of survivability), [uncontrollable
[wildfires]{.mark}, rising [sea levels]{.mark}, [eco]{.mark}logical
[collapse]{.mark}, mass migrations, political [instability]{.mark},
etc]{.underline}., but [[because]{.mark} [CO2 emissions]{.mark} could,
perhaps without any prior warning, [flip the planet]{.mark} into a
completely new state never before en-countered by Homo
sapiens]{.underline}. As a 2019 paper in the journal *Nature*
co-authored by [many]{.underline} of the [scientists]{.underline}
mentioned above [declares]{.underline}: "[[If]{.mark} damaging [tipping
cascades]{.mark} can occur and a global tip-ping point cannot be ruled
out, then [this is]{.mark} an [existential]{.mark} threat to
civilization."[Such language is]{.mark} especially [unsettling
given]{.mark} that climate [scientists]{.mark} [are]{.mark} notoriously
[conservative in]{.mark} their [predictions]{.mark} and "clinical" in
how they express their warnings. A tipping cascade, though, is an
existential threat]{.underline}. 657

From 21 October to 1 November, leaders from across the globe are
gathering in Cali, Colombia for COP16---the 16th Conference of the
Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. This isn't just
another meeting. [[It's a critical moment]{.underline}]{.mark} to assess
how far countries have come in implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global
Biodiversity Framework (GBF), a pivotal plan [[to halt and reverse
biodiversity loss]{.mark} by 2030.]{.underline}

With 27 October designated as Ocean Day at COP16, the [spotlight is on
marine biodiversity and the urgent need to safeguard our
oceans]{.underline}. The WWF Global Arctic Programme is bringing
attention to **[[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[a region [at the
frontlines of climate change and biodiversity
collapse]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[Arctic Ocean ecosystems are]{.mark}
not only vital for the animals and people living there, they also play a
[critical]{.mark} role [in regulating]{.mark} our [global
climate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, [[they face unprecedented threats,
with the Arctic warming four times faster than the rest of the
planet.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[Arctic marine biodiversity at a tipping point]{.underline}**

[**[The Arctic Ocean]{.mark}** is home to iconic wildlife, such as polar
bears and seals, but it also **[supports]{.mark} the [plankton and fish
that sustain entire food chains]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However,
[[this]{.underline} **[biodiversity is under severe
threat]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[[Climate change, coupled with human
activities like shipping and oil and gas exploration]{.mark}, [is
driving]{.mark} the [rapid melting of sea ice and destroying critical
habitats]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [We are fast [approaching a tipping
point]{.mark}---one [where]{.mark} these **[losses will be
irreversible]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The [consequences of inaction are catastrophic]{.underline}. The
[**[melting of]{.mark} the Greenland [ice]{.mark} sheet [and thawing
permafrost]{.mark}** not only spell disaster for Arctic species but
could also [trigger rising sea levels and release]{.mark} even
[more]{.mark} [greenhouse gases, **accelerating global climate
impacts**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For Arctic marine species, these
changes mean habitat loss, crumbling food chains, and a drastically
altered environment that threatens their survival.]{.underline}

Governments must act now

[Given]{.underline} the [magnitude of]{.underline} these
[challenges]{.underline}, the [[urgency]{.underline}]{.mark} for bold
action at COP16 [[cannot be overstated]{.underline}. **[The next five
years will be crucial]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[in preventing
irreversible damage to Arctic ecosystems]{.underline}.]{.mark} To
protect biodiversity and meet the GBF's targets, countries must not only
strengthen their commitments but also focus on implementing effective,
science-based solutions.

#### Biodiversity loss causes extinction

Emile **Torres**, Scholar at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging
Technologies, 5-20-20**16**, \"Biodiversity Loss: An Existential Risk
Comparable to Climate Change,\" Future of Life Institute,
https://futureoflife.org/2016/05/20/biodiversity-loss/

**[Catastrophic consequences for civilization]{.underline}**. The
[consequences of this rapid pruning]{.underline} [of the evolutionary
tree of life extend beyond the obvious]{.underline}. [There could be
**surprising effects**]{.underline} [of biodiversity loss]{.underline}
[that scientists are **unable to**]{.underline} fully [**anticipate** in
advance]{.underline}. For example, prior research has shown that
[**[localized]{.mark}** [ecosystems]{.mark} [can undergo **abrupt and
irreversible shifts**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[when they reach a tipping
point]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to a 2012 paper published in
Nature, there are reasons for thinking that **[we may be approaching a
tipping point]{.underline}** of this sort **[[in the global
ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [beyond which the [consequences could
be **catastrophic**]{.mark} for civilization]{.underline}. As the
authors write, **[[a]{.mark} planetary-scale [transition could
precipitate]{.mark}]{.underline}** "[[substantial losses of **ecosystem
services** **required**]{.mark} [to **sustain**]{.mark} [the human
population]{.mark}]{.underline}." An ecosystem service is any ecological
process that benefits humanity, such as food production and crop
pollination. [If the global ecosystem were to cross a **tipping
point**]{.underline} [and substantial **ecosystem services were
lost**]{.underline}, [[the results could be]{.mark}
"**[widespread]{.mark} [social unrest, economic instability, and loss of
human life]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}" According to Missouri
Botanical Garden ecologist Adam Smith, one of the paper's co-authors,
[[this could occur]{.mark} in]{.underline} a matter of
**[decades]{.underline}**---**[far more [quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}[**than** most of the expected consequences of **climate
change**]{.underline}, **[yet equally destructive]{.underline}**.
[[Biodiversity loss is a "**threat multiplier**]{.mark}"]{.underline}
that, [by [pushing societies to]{.mark} the brink of
[collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[will exacerbate]{.mark} existing
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and introduce]{.mark} entirely
**[new struggles]{.mark}** between state and non-state
actors]{.underline}. Indeed, **[[it]{.mark} [could]{.mark} even [fuel
the rise of terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (After all, climate change
has been linked to the emergence of ISIS in Syria, and multiple
high-ranking US officials, such as former US Defense Secretary Chuck
Hagel and CIA director John Brennan, have affirmed that climate change
and terrorism are connected.) The reality is that **[we are entering the
sixth mass extinction]{.underline}** in the 3.8-billion-year history of
life on Earth, and **[the impact of this event could be felt by
civilization]{.underline}** "in as little as three human lifetimes," as
the aforementioned 2012 Nature paper notes. Furthermore, the [widespread
[decline of biological populations]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} plausibly **[[initiate]{.mark} a [dramatic
transformation]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[of the global
ecosystem]{.underline}** [on an even faster]{.underline}
[timescale]{.underline}: perhaps **[a single human
lifetime.]{.underline}** The **[unavoidable conclusion]{.underline}**
[is that [biodiversity]{.mark} [loss]{.mark}]{.underline} [[constitutes
an **existential threat**]{.mark} in its own right]{.underline}. As
such, [[it ought to be considered]{.mark} [alongside]{.mark} **[climate
change]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [**[the
most]{.underline}** **[significant]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[**contemporary [risk]{.mark}s** **[to human]{.mark}** prosperity
and]{.underline} **[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Food insecurity goes [nuclear]{.underline}.

National University Emeritus Faculty, "How food can end wars, repair
climate and restore the Earth",
https://juliancribb.blog/2022/05/25/how-food-can-end-wars-repair-climate-and-restore-the-earth/

[[Humans have **fought over food**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and the means
of producing it [for **20,000 years**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as rock art
in Australia shows]{.underline}. [[Food]{.underline}]{.mark}, water
[[and land scarcity]{.underline} [are **primary drivers**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} two thirds of [[modern
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} today. Indeed, [many people seem to have
forgotten that the primary German war aim in **World War II** was to
take **farmland** from the Soviets and put German farmers on
it.]{.underline} It is very likely that [controlling the Ukraine's
bountiful and reliable food bowl is among **Putin's** main
aims]{.underline} also. In the short run this is imposing hunger and
even starvation on hundreds of millions of people far beyond Europe. 

**[Spreading [hunger]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in turn [**snowballs** into
**government failures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[civil
wars]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[refugee
tsunamis]{.underline}**]{.mark} [around the world]{.underline} -- as it
did in 2008 when a shortfall in Ukrainian grain exports led to
revolutions in three Arab countries. Already, a third of a billion
people -- equal to the entire population of Europe -- leave their homes
each year, either as refugees or economic migrants, to seek better lives
in countries which seem more stable and food secure. War will add to the
flood.

Thus, in developing a new food system for the world of the 21st Century,
we also have to find a way to curb the human appetite for war.

In [Food or
War](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/environmental-policy-economics-and-law/food-or-war?format=PB),
I trace the links between food and conflict through human history,
explore the role of food in recent conflicts and examine [nine [regions
of the world]{.mark}]{.underline} which [[are at **high risk** of **food
failure**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[conflict]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}]{.mark} [foreseeable
[future]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [conflicts [ranging from riots]{.mark}
and government failure [to **nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. My aim
is to show that [the link between food and war is
**inexorable**]{.underline} -- but that it can be broken. And that
[having enough good food is the most under-rated, under-recognised and
precious 'weapon of peace' in the world today]{.underline}.

#### Renewable infrastructure stabilizes the Arctic economy, enhances energy security and mitigates climate change

**[The [transition to renewable]{.mark} and cleaner [power]{.mark}
supply [has become imperative for the globe]{.mark} because of its
advantage in [mitigating climate change and enhancing energy
security]{.mark} and RET]{.underline}**. This [research has
comprehensively examined the indicators affecting RET, specifically
focusing on EPU, NRR, EVT and EVG. The study employed the MMQR
estimation approach and utilized panel data from 1990 to
2020]{.underline}. The [results highlight]{.underline} the **[[positive
impacts of]{.underline}]{.mark}** NRR, **[[environmental
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology, [and]{.underline} [effective
environmental governance]{.underline} on RET, emphasizing these factors'
[[pivotal]{.underline}]{.mark} [role [in driving]{.mark} the
[transition]{.mark} towards cleaner power supply.]{.underline}
[Conversely, EPU is]{.underline} identified as [a deterrent, negatively
influencing RET outcomes]{.underline}. Furthermore, our study unravels
the causal relationships among these variables. Notably, [unidirectional
causality]{.underline} is [detected from economic policy uncertainty,
natural resource abundance, environmental technology, and environmental
governance to renewable energy transition]{.underline}, [signifying
their influential roles in shaping the trajectory of RET]{.underline}.
Additionally, a significant unidirectional nexus is revealed between EVT
and RET, suggesting a reciprocal relationship where **[[advancements
in]{.mark} environmental [technology and]{.mark} the progression of [RET
mutually influence each other]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus, the proposed
[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark} from this study
[[address]{.underline}]{.mark} the [intermittent nature of renewable
energy sources by advocating for]{.underline} [robust environmental
governance]{.underline} and [advanced technologies that support [energy
storage, grid flexibility, and diversification]{.mark} of energy
sources]{.underline}. [[This approach enables better integration of
renewables]{.mark} into the energy mix, [ensuring]{.mark} a stable and
[reliable supply while reducing dependence on fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Moreover]{.underline}]{.mark},
implementing **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** suggested
**[[plan]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[could have **significant
socio-economic effects**, including **job creation**]{.mark} in the
renewable energy sector, [**enhanced energy security**, and]{.mark}
potential **[reductions in]{.mark}** energy
**[costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Additionally, it may lead to
[**[improved public health outcomes]{.mark}** due to decreased
pollution]{.underline}, [**[contributing to]{.mark} overall [economic
stability]{.mark}** and societal well-being in the Arctic Council
countries]{.underline}. Implementing [the]{.underline} suggested
[plan]{.underline} outlined in this research could [positively
impact]{.underline} [the Arctic region's economy and communities by
boosting local employment]{.underline} [in renewable energy]{.underline}
sectors, [[enhancing energy **independence**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[and]{.underline} [fostering economic **diversification**.]{.underline}
Additionally, it could [improve community health and resilience by
reducing pollution **[and mitigating the effects of climate
change]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

5.2. Research implications

The [study's findings are of substantial relevance for policymakers,
governments, and stakeholders in creating energy policies and strategies
in Arctic nations]{.underline}.

(1) Recognizing economic policy uncertainty's negative and considerable
    influence on renewable energy transition, policymakers should
    prioritize implementing stable and transparent economic policies.
    [[Governments can create]{.mark} a [more]{.mark} favourable climate
    for [investments in renewable energy]{.mark} projects [by decreasing
    uncertainty]{.mark} surrounding economic laws and
    incentives.]{.underline} **[[Long-term policy
    commitments]{.underline}]{.mark}** and regulatory frameworks
    **[[that support renewable energy]{.mark} efforts [will be
    critical]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in overcoming challenges provided
    by economic policy instability in the Arctic region]{.underline}.

(2) [Natural resources' positive and large impact on RET emphasizes the
    significance of sustainable management and utilization of the Arctic
    nations' enormous natural resources.]{.underline} [**[Policymakers
    should]{.mark}** implement rules that promote appropriate
    exploitation and **[use]{.mark}** of these **[resources to fund and
    support]{.mark} renewable energy [projects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A
    systematic and integrated approach to [balancing natural resource
    development and renewable energy transition can help to ensure the
    region's long-term environmental and economic
    viability.]{.underline}

(3) [Recognizing [environmental technology's]{.mark} positive and
    considerable [influence]{.mark}]{.underline} on RET **[[highlights
    the need for policies encouraging]{.mark} clean technology
    [research]{.mark}, [development, and
    implementation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
    [[Stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark} in Arctic countries [[should
    promote]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[adoption]{.mark} of innovative
    environmental technologies, thereby creating a favourable ecosystem
    [for businesses]{.mark} and sectors involved in renewable
    energy]{.underline}. [Partnerships across the public and private
    sectors can help develop and implement cutting-edge technologies
    that optimize the effective functioning and accessibility of
    alternative power solutions.]{.underline}

(4) As a result of the positive and significant effect of environmental
    governance on RET, [policymakers should prioritize establishing and
    reinforcing effective governance structures]{.underline}.
    Transparent and [responsible environmental governance
    frameworks]{.underline} can help [integrate renewable energy
    programs into national strategies]{.underline}. Legislators should
    consult with stakeholders, including local communities and industry
    participants, to ensure that governance methods are consistent with
    the goals of sustainable energy development. Strengthening
    institutions responsible for environmental regulation and
    enforcement will be essential to create an environment conducive to
    successfully implementing renewable energy projects. Thus, Arctic
    countries' policymakers, governments, and stakeholders can use the
    research findings to develop comprehensive and targeted policies.
    [Arctic nations can accelerate their renewable energy
    transitions]{.underline} and contribute to the greater global effort
    towards sustainable and resilient energy systems [by addressing
    economic policy uncertainties, promoting sustainable natural
    resource management, fostering technological innovation, and
    improving environmental governance]{.underline}.

(5) This study also suggests a multi-agent system's decision-making
    procedure, which involves simulating interactions among various
    stakeholders, such as energy producers, consumers, and regulators,
    to optimize renewable energy integration under erratic carbon and
    electricity pricing. This system will allow agents to dynamically
    adjust their strategies to market fluctuations, enhancing resilience
    and efficiency in the energy transition process. Moreover, this
    study further suggests that the energy sector's regulatory and
    policy frameworks of the Arctic region advocate for enhanced
    environmental governance and policies that support renewable energy
    integration, such as incentives for clean technology investments and
    carbon pricing mechanisms. Policies like renewable energy subsidies,
    tax incentives, and robust carbon pricing can facilitate the
    practical implementation of this strategy, driving the transition
    towards a sustainable energy system.

### 1AC -- Advantage -- Grids

#### Critical infrastructure in the Arctic is sparse and made more vulnerable by climate change; even fossil energy is threatened 

**Piché 24** (Dr. Rivard Piché is a strategic analyst with Defence
Research and Development Canada. Since joining DRDC in 2016, she worked
closely with the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Special Operations
Forces Command, August 2024, \"Vulnerabilities and Hybrid Threats in the
North American Arctic\", Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs) -- DOA
6/4/2025, MoState JG

Critical infrastructure encompasses the array of "processes, systems,
facilities, technologies, networks, assets and services essential to the
health, safety, security or economic well-being of \[a country's
population\] and the effective functioning of government."10 Compared to
other parts of the continent, the [[North American Arctic suffers from a
glaring deficiency in critical infrastructure]{.mark},]{.underline}
further [[compounded by]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[heightened
vulnerability to environmental stressors and
damage]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Shortcomings in redundancy,
maintenance]{.mark} deficiencies, [and]{.mark} the [impact of climate
change on permafrost and ice layers exacerbate this]{.mark} challenge,
jeopardizing the safety and wellbeing of local populations and [impeding
resilience in the face of]{.mark} disasters and
[emergencies]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the [lack of roads
and]{.underline} the ongoing [challenge of maintaining existing ones as
the permafrost shifts severely restricts access to isolated
communities]{.underline}. In Iqaluit, the largest population center in
Nunavut, insufficient access to potable water required the intervention
of the Canadian Armed Forces in 2022.11 Additionally, [limited
telecommunications and internet connectivity across the region creates
significant hurdles for local communities, as well as government and
military operations]{.underline}.12 While the gradual installation of
sub-sea optical cables across the region enhances internet
accessibility, recent incidents highlight the need for redundancy
through satellite-based services.13 [In Alaska, where the energy sector
generates 80 percent of the state government's revenues, [concerns
loom]{.mark} large [over]{.mark} the [durability and safety of]{.mark}
the [Trans-Alaska pipeline and associated infrastructure]{.mark} [amid
permafrost thawing]{.mark}]{.underline}. 14 [Any incident would
disproportionately impact Native communities and their land,
exacerbating the situation due to constrained disaster response and
search-and-rescue capabilities.]{.underline}

#### Natural disasters from climate change collapse the grid 

**Wickerson 24** (Grace Wickerson, 4-3-2024, \"When America Goes Dark,
What Comes Next?\", Federation of American Scientists,
https://fas.org/publication/grid-failure-extreme-heat/) -- DOA:
6/8/2025, MoState JG

Challenge [[Grids are facing unprecedented strain due to record-high
temperatures]{.underline}, [which reduce]{.underline}]{.mark} [their
energy transmission [efficiency and spike demand]{.mark} for air
conditioning]{.underline} during the summer. On top of this, [new
industries are pushing grids to their limits.]{.underline} The
Washington Post and insights from the utility industry cite the
exponential growth of artificial intelligence and data centers for cloud
computing and crypto mining as drivers of a nearly [twofold increase in
electricity consumption over the past decade]{.underline}. Projections
from NERC paint a dire picture: between 2024 and 2028, an alarming 300
million people across the United States could face power outages. This
underscores the pressing need for robust emergency response and public
health planning. The [[impact of power loss is especially profound for
vulnerable populations]{.underline}]{.mark}, including those reliant on
electricity-dependent medical equipment and life-saving medications that
require refrigeration. [[Extreme heat significantly increases public
health risks]{.mark}]{.underline} by [exacerbating mental health,
behavioral disorders, and chronic illnesses]{.underline} such as heart
and respiratory conditions, and increasing the likelihood of preterm
births and developmental issues in infants and children. Excessive
temperatures also impose burdens on older adults. [Since
2015,]{.underline} national power [[outages have surged]{.mark} by [over
150% owing to demand and **extreme weather amplified by climate
change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Increasing [temperatures can cause
[transformers]{.mark} to overheat and [explode]{.mark}]{.underline},
sometimes [[sparking fires and cascading outages]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Other types of [[severe weather]{.underline}]{.mark} events, such as
lightning strikes, high winds, and flying debris, further
[[escalate]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark} of utility infrastructure
damage]{.underline}. In 2020, 22 extreme weather events -- from
[cyclones]{.underline} to [hurricanes, heat, and drought]{.underline} --
[cost]{.underline} [the U.S. a combined \$95 billion]{.underline}. The
following year, [[disasters]{.mark} like the Texas winter storm and the
Pacific Northwest heatwave vividly [illustrated]{.mark} the **[severe
consequences of extreme weather on grid
stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To put this into perspective, The
Pacific Northwest heatwave resulted in thousands of heat-related
emergency department visits and over 700 deaths. During the Texas winter
storm, 4.5 million customers went without power, leading to over 240
deaths and economic damages estimated at \$130 billion. These [[events
led to rolling blackouts, thousands of]{.underline}]{.mark} heat-related
[[emergency room visits, numerous deaths, and substantial economic
losses]{.underline}]{.mark}. This remains an actively ongoing paradigm,
with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
([[NOAA]{.underline}]{.mark}) 2023 Billion-dollar [disaster report
**[confirm]{.mark}**ing [28 weather and climate disasters in a single
year]{.mark}, surpassing the previous record of 22 in 2020, [with a
price tag of at least \$92.9 billion]{.mark}. [Historical
disasters,]{.mark} such as Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the Northeastern
blackout in 2003, [are stark reminders of the devastating impact of
prolonged]{.mark} power [outages]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[[aftermath]{.mark} of such events [includes loss of life, disruptions
to healthcare]{.mark} access, [and extensive economic
damages.]{.mark}]{.underline} Hurricane [Maria affected 1.6 million
people, with loss of electricity for 328 days, 4600 direct deaths -- 70
times the official toll -- and an estimated third more excess deaths
attributed to the lack of access to health care,]{.underline} and an
[estimated \$90 billion in damages]{.underline}. The Northeastern
blackout impacted 30 million customers across the U.S. and Canada,
causing at least 11 deaths and estimated economic losses of \$6 billion.
A stark 2023 study reported that "[[If a multi-day blackout in Phoenix
coincided with a heat wave,]{.mark} nearly [half the population would
require emergency]{.mark} department [care]{.mark} for heat stroke or
other heat-related illnesses."]{.underline} [Under such conditions, the
researchers estimate that [12,800 people]{.mark} in Phoenix [would
die]{.mark}]{.underline}. During these events, restoring power and
providing mass care falls on various entities. Utility and power
operators are tasked with repairing grid infrastructure, while the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinates interagency
actions through its National Response Framework and Emergency Support
Functions (ESFs). For example, ESF #6 handles mass care missions like
sheltering and feeding, while ESF #8 coordinates public health efforts,
overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). FEMA's
Power Outage Incident Annex (POIA) enables utility operators to request
support through ESF #12. While there is some testing of system responses
to blackouts, few states have conducted exercises at scale, which is
crucial, given the immense complexity of restarting grid infrastructure
and coordinating mass care operations simultaneously.

#### That causes nuclear meltdowns and zirconium fires -- extinction -- made worse by cyber vulnerabilities 

**Leyse 24** (Mark Leyse, is a nuclear power safety advocate, focusing
on fuel-cladding issues, severe accidents, and improving evaluations of
postulated accidents. Safety issues he raised in a petition for
rulemaking, PRM-50-84, contributed to a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission
rulemaking on fuel-cladding behavior under reactor loss-of-coolant
accident conditions---revisions to Section 50.46(b)---that was approved
in 2012. In 2014, he wrote a report for Natural Resources Defense
Council on unresolved problems associated with severe accident hydrogen
generation. 4-2-2024, \"Spent nuclear fuel mismanagement poses a major
threat to the United States. Here\'s how.\", Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists,
https://thebulletin.org/2024/04/spent-nuclear-fuel-mismanagement-poses-a-major-threat-to-the-united-states-heres-how/)
-- DOA: 6/8/24, MoState JG

Irradiated fuel assemblies---essentially bundles of fuel rods with
zirconium alloy cladding sheathing uranium dioxide fuel pellets---that
have been removed from a nuclear reactor (spent fuel) generate a great
deal of heat from the radioactive decay of the nuclear fuel's unstable
fission products. This heat source is termed decay heat. Spent fuel is
so thermally hot and radioactive that it must be submerged in
circulating water and cooled in a storage pool (spent fuel pool) for
several years before it can be moved to dry storage.

The [dangers of reactor meltdowns are well known]{.underline}. But
[[spent fuel can]{.mark} also overheat and [burn]{.mark} in a storage
pool [if]{.mark} its [coolant water is lost]{.mark}]{.underline},
thereby potentially [releasing large amounts of radioactive material
into the air. This type of accident is [known as a]{.mark} spent fuel
pool fire or **[zirconium fire]{.mark}**]{.underline}, named after the
fuel cladding. [[All]{.mark} commercial nuclear power
[plants]{.mark}]{.underline} in the United States---and nearly all in
the world---[[have at least one spent]{.mark} fuel [pool]{.mark} on
site]{.underline}. [A **fire at an overloaded pool** (which exist at
many US nuclear power plants) could release radiation that dwarfs what
the Chernobyl nuclear accident emitted.]{.underline}

Many analysts see very rare, severe earthquakes as the [[greatest
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to spent fuel pools; however, [another far
more [likely]{.mark} event could threaten US nuclear sites: a widespread
**[collapse of the]{.mark} power [grid]{.mark}** system.]{.underline}
[Such a collapse could be triggered by a variety of events, including
solar storms]{.underline}, [physical attacks, and
cyberattacks---]{.underline}all of which are known, documented
possibilities. Safety experts have warned for decades about the dangers
of overloading spent fuel pools, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
and Congress have refused to act.

The threat of overloaded spent fuel pools. [Spent fuel
[pools]{.mark}]{.underline} at US nuclear plants [[are]{.mark} almost as
[densely packed]{.mark} with nuclear fuel as operating
reactors]{.underline}---a hazard that has existed for decades and
**[vastly [increases]{.mark} the [odds of]{.mark}]{.underline}** having
**[[a major accident]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Spent fuel assemblies could ignite---starting a zirconium fire---if an
overloaded pool were to lose a sizable portion or all of its coolant
water]{.underline}. In a scenario in which coolant water boils off,
[uncovered zirconium cladding of fuel assemblies may overheat and
chemically react with steam,]{.underline} [generating explosive hydrogen
gas]{.underline}. A [substantial amount of hydrogen would almost
certainly detonate, destroying the building that houses the spent fuel
pool.]{.underline} ([Only a small quantity of energy is required to
ignite hydrogen gas]{.underline}, [including electric sparks from
equipment]{.underline}. It is speculated a ringing telephone initiated a
hydrogen explosion that occurred during the Three Mile Island accident
in 1979.)

[A [zirconium fire]{.mark} in an exposed spent fuel pool
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} have the potential to [[emit **far more
radioactive cesium**]{.mark} 137 **[than]{.mark}** the
**[Chernobyl]{.mark}** accident released]{.underline}. (The US Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) has conducted analyses that found a
zirconium fire at a densely packed pool could release as much as 24
megacuries of cesium 137; the Chernobyl accident is estimated to have
released 2.3 megacuries of cesium 137.) Such [a disaster could
contaminate thousands of square miles of land in urban and rural areas,
potentially **[exposing millions]{.mark}** of people **to large doses of
ionizing radiation**, many of whom could die from early or latent
cancer.]{.underline}

In contrast, if a thinly packed pool were deprived of coolant water, its
spent fuel assemblies would likely release about 1 percent of the
radioactive material predicted to be released by a zirconium fire at a
densely packed pool. A thinly packed pool has a much smaller inventory
of radioactive material than a densely packed pool; it also contains
much less zirconium. If such a limited amount of zirconium were to react
with steam, most likely too little hydrogen would be generated to
threaten the integrity of the spent fuel pool building.

After being cooled under water for a minimum of three years, spent fuel
assemblies can be transferred from pools to giant, hermetically sealed
canisters of reinforced steel and concrete that shield plant workers and
the public from ionizing radiation. This liquid-free method of storage,
which cools the spent fuel assemblies by passive air convection, is
called "dry cask storage."

A typical US storage pool for a 1,000-megawatt-electric reactor contains
from 400 to 500 metric tons of spent fuel assemblies. (Dry casks can
store 10 to 15 tons of spent fuel assemblies, so each cask contains a
far lower amount of radioactive material than a storage pool.) Reducing
the total inventories of spent fuel assemblies stored in US spent fuel
pools by roughly 70 to 80 percent reduces their amount of radioactive
cesium by about 50 percent. And the heat load in each pool drops by
about 25 to 30 percent. With low-density storage, a pool's spent fuel
assemblies are separated from each other to an extent that greatly
improves their ability to be cooled by air convection in the event that
the pool loses its coolant water. Moreover, a dry cask storage area,
which has passive cooling, is less vulnerable to either accidents or
sabotage than a spent fuel pool.

In the aftermath of the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan,
in which there was a risk of spent fuel assemblies igniting, the NRC
considered forcing US utilities to expedite the transfer of all
sufficiently-cooled spent fuel assemblies stored in overloaded pools to
dry cask storage. The NRC decided against implementing such a safety
measure.

To help justify its decision, the NRC chose to analyze only one scenario
that might lead to a zirconium fire: a severe earthquake. In 2014, the
NRC claimed that a severe earthquake with a magnitude "expected to occur
once in 60,000 years" is the prototypical initiating event that would
lead to a zirconium fire in a boiling water reactor's spent fuel pool.

The NRC's 2014 study concluded that the type of earthquake it selected
for its analyses would cause a zirconium fire and a large radiological
release to occur at a densely packed spent fuel pool once every nine
million years (or even less frequently). Restricting its analyses to a
severe earthquake scenario allowed the NRC to help allay public fears
over the dangers of spent fuel pool accidents. (At the time of the
Fukushima Daiichi accident, the New York Times and other news outlets
warned that a zirconium fire could break out in the plant's Unit 4 spent
fuel pool, causing global public concern.)

[There is good reason to question whether severe earthquakes pose the
greatest threat]{.underline} to spent fuel pools. [A **[widespread
collapse of the]{.mark} US power [grid]{.mark}** system]{.underline}
that would last for a [period of months]{.underline} to
years---estimated to occur once in a century---[may be **[far more
likely]{.mark} to lead to a zirconium fire** than a severe
earthquake.]{.underline} The prospect that a widespread, long-term
blackout will occur within the next 100 years should prompt US utilities
to expedite the transfer of spent fuel from pools to dry cask storage.
Utilities in other nations, including in Japan, that have overloaded
pools should follow suit.

Solar storms, [physical [attacks]{.mark}, and cyberattacks have the
potential to [cause]{.mark} a nightmare scenario]{.underline} in which
[the US power grid [collapses]{.mark}, along with other vital
infrastructures---[leading to]{.mark} reactor [meltdowns and]{.mark}
spent fuel [pool fires, whose]{.mark} radioactive [emissions]{.mark}
would [aggravate]{.mark} the [disaster.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Vulnerability to solar storms. In 2012, the NRC issued a Federal
Register notice stating that an extreme [[solar
storm]{.underline}]{.mark} (with its accompanying geomagnetic storm at
the Earth[) could [cause]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[failure]{.underline}]{.mark} of hundreds of extra-high voltage
transformers---with a maximum voltage rating of at least 345
kilovolts---[precipitating widespread, long-term blackouts]{.underline}.
The NRC posited that such a solar storm might occur once in 153 years to
once in 500 years and [initiate "a series of events potentially leading
to \[reactor\] core damage at multiple nuclear sites."]{.underline}

The NRC's Federal Register notice announced the agency had determined
that the threat of prolonged power outages leading to at least one spent
fuel pool fire must be addressed in its rulemaking process. The NRC
decided to consider enacting regulations that Thomas Popik of the
Foundation for Resilient Societies, a non-profit organization focusing
on infrastructure reliability, requested in a petition for rulemaking.
Popik asked the NRC to require plant owners to ensure spent fuel pools
would have long-term cooling and a replenished supply of coolant water
in the event that an extreme solar storm collapsed large portions of the
US power grid for a period of months to years. Among other things, Popik
was concerned that emergency diesel generators would not be able to
supply the onsite electricity needed to cool the spent fuel pool for
more than a few days.

Over the past 160 years, the Earth has been hit by two solar
superstorms---the 1859 Carrington Event and the 1921 New York Railroad
Superstorm---that would be powerful enough to disable large portions of
today's global power grids. Scientists estimate that such extreme solar
storms may hit the Earth once in a century, so the odds are that the
Earth will be hit by a solar superstorm at some point during this
century. In July 2012, a solar superstorm, estimated to have been more
intense than the Carrington Event, crossed the Earth's orbit, missing
the Earth by about 11 million miles, or by one week's time.\*

Solar superstorms are caused by coronal mass ejections: Eruptions of
billions of tons of electrically-charged particles spat from the Sun's
corona, which travel at velocities as fast as several million miles per
hour and can reach the Earth within 24 hours. Most coronal mass
ejections, however, miss the Earth because it is a relatively small
point within the solar system.

When a solar superstorm's electrically-charged particles envelop the
Earth, they cause [extreme geomagnetic storms---mostly affecting
high]{.underline} [northern and southern]{.underline}
[latitudes]{.underline}. In a geomagnetic storm, the Earth's geomagnetic
field varies in magnitude, creating electric fields in the ground that
induce electric currents in the power grid. Extreme geomagnetic storms
may induce electric currents strong enough to melt the copper windings
of extra-high voltage transformers, which may become damaged beyond
repair and need to be replaced.

Extra-high voltage transformers are mostly manufactured overseas and
difficult to transport. (Such transformers weigh between 100 and 400
tons.) In the United States, only a small number of facilities build
extra-high voltage transformers. They cost several million dollars to
manufacture and install; each is custom made to fit the specifications
of its substation. Different designs are not typically interchangeable
with one another, and few spares are manufactured. Manufacturing and
installing even one such massive transformer can take over one year.

Solar storms that were far less intense than the New York Railroad
Superstorm have collapsed modern power grids. In the early hours of
March 13, 1989, on a freezing night, a geomagnetic storm caused Canada's
Hydro-Québec grid to collapse within 90 seconds, leaving six million
people without electric power for about 9 hours. (The magnitude of
geomagnetic storms can be measured in nanoteslas per minute, where the
tesla is a unit of magnetic flux density.) The New York Railroad
Superstorm is estimated to have reached a magnitude of approximately
5,000 nanoteslas per minute, and the March 1989 Storm was one-tenth as
intense, reaching approximately 480 nanoteslas per minute. In late
October 2003, geomagnetic storms less intense than the March 1989 Storm
caused a blackout in southern Sweden and permanently damaged 15
extra-high voltage transformers in South Africa by overheating them.

Solar storms can cause large geomagnetic field variations to suddenly
materialize over vast geographic areas, precipitating multiple,
near-simultaneous failures at different locations of the electric power
grid system. Over the past half century, the United States and other
nations have dramatically expanded their power grids---adding more
long-distance transmission lines and high-voltage
infrastructure---thereby increasing their vulnerability to geomagnetic
storms. Moreover, the [[aging]{.mark} of vital]{.underline} power-grid
[infrastructures also [increases]{.mark} the grid's
[vulnerability]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Vulnerability to physical attacks]{.underline}. On April 16, 2013,
gunmen attacked the Metcalf Transmission Substation in San Jose,
California, rendering it out of service. The gunmen shot 120 rounds from
semiautomatic rifles, hitting 17 extra-high voltage transformers. The
transformers leaked more than 50,000 gallons of cooling oil. They
overheated, without exploding, and shut down. According to Jon
Wellinghoff, a former Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, the Metcalf attack nearly caused a blackout in Silicon
Valley; one that may have persisted for a period of several weeks.

In response to the assault on Metcalf, its owner---Pacific Gas and
Electric---decided to spend \$100 million over the course of three years
to help fortify its substations. That did not prevent thieves, in August
2014, from cutting through a fence at Metcalf and pilfering construction
equipment that was intended to bolster security. It took utility workers
more than four hours to realize the substation had been burgled.

In January 2022, the Department of Homeland Security warned that
[domestic [terrorists]{.mark} have been [devising]{.mark} credible
[strategies for sabotaging the]{.mark} US power [grid]{.mark} over the
past few years.]{.underline} Protecting all 55,000 substations that make
up the US grid, however, is a difficult task. In December 2022, at least
one malefactor shot at and severely damaged two substations---owned by
Duke Energy---in North Carolina's Moore County, located about 90 miles
east of Charlotte. Around 45,000 homes and businesses lost electricity
as a result, and tens of thousands of customers got their power restored
only after several days. Commenting on the Moore County attacks,
Wellinghoff observed that "[most \[substations\] don't seem]{.underline}
to be very well [protected]{.underline}. Many of them still have chain
link fences, like the one in North Carolina."

In 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that a US Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission analysis had concluded that [[if saboteurs]{.mark}
synchronized physical attacks]{.underline} [and [disabled **as few as
nine**]{.mark} critical power **[substations]{.mark}**, especially on a
hot summer day, **[the entire]{.mark} US [mainland could lose]{.mark}
electric [power for]{.mark} several [months]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, determining or simply procuring information about the
locations of the most critical substations in the continental US is a
relatively easy task.

[[Malefactors can]{.underline}]{.mark} also physically [[attack]{.mark}
substations [remotely]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance,
[drones]{.underline} armed [with improvised explosive
devices]{.underline} could [target US substations in synchronized
swarms,]{.underline} potentially collapsing the power grid. In September
2022, [[Russia attacked]{.underline}]{.mark} civilian [infrastructure in
[Ukraine]{.mark}, including the Ukrainian power
[grid]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} waves of Iranian
Shahed-136, "kamikaze" [[drones]{.underline}]{.mark}. These drones can
carry up to 110 pounds (50 kilograms) of explosives over hundreds of
miles. Kamikaze drones explode on impact. In October 2022, Russian
kamikaze drones partly disrupted the delivery of electricity in the
three major Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Lviv.

[Vulnerability to cyberattacks]{.underline}. In December 2015, [Russian
hackers caused power outages in Ukraine by remotely opening circuit
breakers,]{.underline} thereby [cutting off the flow of electricity, at
dozens of substations.]{.underline} It is the first confirmed instance,
worldwide, that a [[cyberattack]{.mark} caused a
[blackout]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within minutes, the hackers targeted
three energy utilities, causing outages that lasted six hours and
affected nearly a quarter-million people. Fortunately, the Ukrainian
power grid has the odd benefit of being partly antiquated. It is not
completely dependent on computer control systems; that is, industrial
control systems and supervisory control and data acquisition (also known
as "SCADA") systems, which monitor and command an electric grid's
physical equipment. Ukrainian grid operators were able to turn the power
back on by bypassing their compromised control systems and manually
closing circuit breakers at affected substations[. One year later, in
December 2016, another Russian cyberattack would cause a second blackout
in Ukraine.]{.underline}

The 2016 cyberattack was more sophisticated than that of 2015. Power was
restored after one hour; however, the hackers shut down a large Kyiv
substation that handled a greater electric load (200 megawatts) than the
total load handled by the dozens of substations that had been
successfully targeted the previous year. The [hackers [deployed
malware]{.mark}]{.underline}---later named "CrashOverride"---that
analysts have characterized [[as "an automated, grid-killing
weapon]{.mark}."]{.underline}

CrashOverride was designed to communicate with the Ukrainian power
grid's particular computer control systems, enabling it to manipulate
the behavior of physical equipment at substations. At a preset time,
CrashOverride opened circuit breakers at targeted substations to
precipitate the blackout, without requiring oversight from hackers.

[Malware programs]{.underline} like CrashOverride [can]{.underline} also
[be tailored to attack European and North American power
grids.]{.underline} Some analysts have posited that Ukraine is "Russia's
test lab for cyberwar," noting that ["in the cyber world]{.underline},
[[what happens in Kiev]{.mark} almost [never stays]{.mark} in
Kiev]{.underline}." The [[US]{.mark} power [grid is more computerized
and automated]{.mark} than Ukraine's grid, [providing]{.mark} [many
openings]{.mark} for cyber infiltration]{.underline}. The Idaho National
Laboratory (INL) has warned that the
[[interconnectivity]{.underline}]{.mark} of SCADA systems [[exposes
the]{.mark} US power [grid]{.mark} to cyberattacks]{.underline}.

Given enough time, hackers could penetrate US transmission networks and
plant CrashOverride or another tailored malware at any number of desired
locations. CrashOverride can automatically execute the task of scanning
transmission networks and selecting multiple targets, including those
that control automated on-off switches for circuit breakers. Once
entrenched, CrashOverride is set "like a ticking bomb," ready to sow
chaos in power grid systems at any specified time.

Analysts at Dragos and Eset, two cyber-security companies for critical
infrastructure, have pointed out that CrashOverride contains some code
indicating it [has the capacity to disable protective
relays]{.underline}, which protect transmission lines and transformers
against electric surges by opening circuit breakers. If hackers rendered
protective relays inoperable while increasing local electric loads, they
could cause transmission lines to melt and transformers to burn. [Wide
portions of the US grid could become disabled for months to years if
hackers managed to destroy many extra-high voltage
transformers.]{.underline}

In 2016, Idaho National Laboratory analysts came to similar conclusions
as those at Dragos and Eset, warning that [[a major cyberattack]{.mark}
on the US grid]{.underline} could [seriously damage critical
equipment]{.underline}, including extra-high voltage transformers, [and
[lead to cascading blackouts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some substations have
networks that are incapable of detecting hackers' intrusions and planted
malware. INL analysts have cautioned that hackers could exploit such
vulnerabilities to launch a coordinated cyberattack against multiple
substations. Five years later, in June 2021[, US Energy Secretary
Jennifer Granholm acknowledged that hackers have the capability to shut
down the US power grid.]{.underline}

Insufficient public safety. After the Fukushima Daiichi accident, the US
nuclear industry established the Diverse and Flexible Mitigation
Capability (FLEX) strategy, which is intended to help workers at nuclear
plants manage a severe accident. The FLEX strategy stipulates that plant
sites store portable equipment, such as backup generators and battery
packs that can provide emergency power and pumps that can inject coolant
water into the reactor or spent fuel pool. Such equipment is also stored
at two national response centers, located in Memphis, Tennessee and
Phoenix, Arizona. The response centers must be capable of dispatching
required equipment to any nuclear plant located in the United States
within 24 hours. However, each center only houses five complete sets of
FLEX equipment, not nearly enough equipment to simultaneously service
the entire US nuclear reactor fleet.

[**In a long-term, nationwide blackout, US nuclear power [plants would
lose]{.mark} their supply of [offsite electricity]{.mark}.** Emergency
diesel generators, which provide onsite electricity, are back-up systems
designed to power cooling pumps and other safety equipment only for a
relatively short period of time]{.underline}. Such [[generators]{.mark}
would likely [fail]{.mark} to operate continuously for a period of
months to years.]{.underline} The longest loss-of-offsite power events
in the United States all lasted less than a week.

Most US nuclear plants are required to have at least a seven-day onsite
supply of fuel for emergency diesel generators, and many have
arrangements to receive prompt deliveries of fuel. Yet [amid the
logistical challenges and social disruptions of a nationwide, long-term
blackout, it appears [unlikely]{.mark} that a steady [fuel]{.mark}
supply [could be]{.mark} transported to and [maintained]{.mark} at every
nuclear plant in the US fleet.]{.underline}

Overloading spent fuel pools should be outlawed. Safety analysts have
warned about the dangers of overloading spent fuel pools since the
1970s. For decades, experts and organizations have argued that in order
to improve safety, sufficiently cooled spent fuel assemblies should be
removed from high-density spent fuel pools and transferred to passively
cooled dry cask storage. Sadly, the NRC has not heeded their advice.

In the face of the NRC's inaction, Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts
introduced The Dry Cask Storage Act in 2014, calling for the thinning
out of spent fuel pools. The act, which Senator Markey has reintroduced
in subsequent congressional sessions, has not passed into law.

The relatively high probability of a nationwide grid collapse, which
would lead to multiple nuclear disasters, emphasizes the need to
expedite the transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage. According to
Frank von Hippel, a professor of public and international affairs
emeritus at Princeton University, the impact of a single accident at an
overstocked spent fuel pool has the potential to be two orders of
magnitude more devastating in terms of radiological releases than the
three Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns combined. If the US grid collapses for
a lengthy period of time, society would likely descend into chaos, as
uncooled nuclear fuel burned at multiple sites and spewed radioactive
plumes into the environment.

The [value of preventing the destruction of US society and untold human
suffering is incalculable]{.underline}. So, on the issue of protecting
people and the environment from spent fuel pool fires, it is surprising
when one learns that promptly transferring the nationwide inventories of
spent fuel assemblies that have been cooled for at least five years from
US pools to dry cask storage would be "relatively inexpensive"---less
than (in 2012 dollars) a total of \$4 billion (\$5.4 billion in today's
dollars). That is far, far less than the monetary toll of losing vast
tracts of urban and rural land for generations to come because of
radioactive contamination.

One should also consider that plant owners are required, as part of the
decommissioning process, to transfer spent fuel assemblies from storage
pools to dry cask storage after nuclear plants are permanently shut
down. So, in accordance with industry protocols, all spent fuel
assemblies at plant sites are intended to eventually be placed in dry
cask storage (before ultimately being transported to a long-term surface
storage site or a permanent geologic repository).

If the NRC continues to allow the industry's mismanagement of [[spent
fuel]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[pose an **existential** threat]{.mark} to
the United States]{.underline}, Congress must be compelled to pass
legislation requiring utilities to swiftly thin out spent fuel pools.

#### But renewables solve and secure energy independence

[Alaska\'s push toward renewable energy is bringing an unexpected bright
spot]{.underline} to the Last Frontier.

When Jenn Miller and her husband, Chris Colbert, installed solar panels
on their Anchorage home in 2017, they discovered something surprising:
Solar power works in Alaska.

That revelation led them to launch Renewable IPP, which now operates the
state\'s largest solar farm, powering 1,400 homes with clean energy,
according to Inside Climate News.

This development is exciting because these **[[renewable projects are
proving more cost-effective]{.mark} than traditional power
sources.]{.underline}** [[As]{.mark} Alaska\'s [natural gas]{.mark}
supplies [dwindle]{.mark}, [utilities are facing]{.mark} the prospect of
[importing]{.mark} expensive liquefied natural [gas by
2027]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The solution? [Turning to renewable energy]{.mark}, which a federal
study shows [could provide substantial savings]{.mark} for Alaskans
[while ensuring energy independence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The transition isn\'t without its challenges.

\"[[We have a very old and outdated grid]{.mark}. This is our biggest
challenge,\" says Curtis Thayer, executive director of the Alaska Energy
Authority. But that\'s not stopping innovative solutions]{.underline}.

These [[renewable projects are creating solutions uniquely tailored to
Alaska\'s environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Solar]{.mark} panels
[capture both direct sunlight and reflection from]{.mark} winter
[snow]{.mark}, while [wind turbines are specially engineered to operate
in temperatures as low as minus 40]{.mark} degrees]{.underline}.

Some projects are pulling double duty. Miller\'s solar farm is
experimenting with growing potatoes between the panel rows.

\"We need to save the planet. But most people can\'t afford an increase
in their power bill,\" said Miller. \"When we talk about an equitable
transition, it has to be a cost-competitive transition so it makes sense
for everybody.\"

Miller\'s company is already planning its next project on the Kenai
Peninsula: a solar installation more than five times larger than its
current one. Its [[existing project already delivers power at
prices]{.mark} 10% to [20% below]{.mark} what residents pay for natural
[gas-generated electricity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"[This totally works]{.underline},\" Miller said about solar power in
Alaska.

#### Wind and solar specifically are key

[[Clean electricity]{.mark} will not only displace CO2 emissions from
the power sector: it will also [help reduce emissions from other
sectors]{.mark}.]{.underline} The increasing adoption of electric
vehicles for transport, heat pumps for heating and electrical processes
in industry is reducing the direct use of gas and oil, but increasing
demand for electricity. [Accelerating]{.underline} the [deployment of
clean power is the obvious way to meet this additional demand without
resorting to additional coal and gas generation]{.underline}.

While there are many solutions available for reducing power sector
emissions while scaling up the electricity supply, [two proven
technologies stand out]{.underline} as clear winners for slashing
emissions by the volume required this decade -- [wind and solar power.
**[Wind and solar are the cheapest,]{.mark} the [quickest]{.mark} to
deploy [and]{.mark} among the [cleanest]{.mark}, least carbon-intensive
power sources.**]{.underline}

\[CHART OMITTED\]

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [(IPCC) estimates that,
globally, [wind and solar alone]{.mark} can [deliver more than a third
of]{.mark} the emissions [reductions needed]{.mark} for]{.underline} a
[1.5 degree pathway across all sectors by 2030.]{.underline}

\[CHART OMITTED\]

[Wind and solar are the cheapest solutions]{.underline}

**[Solar and wind power [costs have been declining
rapidly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. During the decade to 2020, the [cost of
wind and solar power fell [by 55]{.mark}% [and 85%,]{.mark}]{.underline}
respectively. The [[cost of batteries,]{.mark} increasingly used to
store renewable electricity, [also fell]{.mark} by [85%]{.mark} over the
same time period.]{.underline}

Overall, [wind and solar costs have continued to fall since 2020
[despite supply chain issues]{.mark} relating to the Covid-19 pandemic
and Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, which produced a
short-term uptick in wind power costs in some regions. [[Analysts
foresee continuing cost reductions]{.mark} for both wind and solar in
the coming years]{.underline}.

\[CHART OMITTED\]

When considered [over an asset's lifetime]{.underline}, the
[**[cost]{.mark}** of producing a unit of electricity from onshore wind
and solar]{.underline} PV, [[is]{.mark} now generally **[well
below]{.mark} that of [gas and coal]{.mark}** in many
countries]{.underline}. According to data from the International
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), [85% of global utility-scale wind and
solar capacity was added at a cheaper cost than fossil-powered
alternatives in 2022]{.underline}. In some cases [it is even cheaper to
build and run new wind or solar farms than to continue running existing
fossil fuel plants]{.underline}.

\[CHART OMITTED\]

In fact, [renewable energy, globally, saved consumers \$521bn in 2022
through reduced demand]{.underline} for fossil fuels in the power
sector, according to IRENA analysis. This is [more than 0.5% of global
GDP]{.underline}. Ember analysis also found that more ambitious clean
power pathways in Europe would reduce overall energy system costs
compared to current plans that prolong reliance on fossil fuels.
Globally, the quicker the transition, the greater the savings.

[[Wind and solar are quick to deploy]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [amount of wind and solar capacity added every year is far outpacing
growth in both fossil fuel capacity and alternative clean
technologies.]{.underline} [Solar's capacity growth in particular has
regularly exceeded forecasts.]{.underline}

\[CHART OMITTED\]

[Wind and solar [farms]{.mark} can be assembled [in]{.mark} a matter of
[months]{.mark} -- [rooftop solar in]{.mark} a matter of
[days]{.mark}]{.underline}. Meanwhile, other [clean technologies such as
[nuclear]{.mark} power plants [and]{.mark} large [hydro]{.mark} dams can
[take]{.mark} multiple [years]{.mark} to build, a major reason why wind
and solar will be crucial in providing the majority of new clean
generation this decade]{.underline} -- [as much as 89%,]{.underline}
according to International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero pathways.

Furthermore, [[wind and solar are not dependent on geographical
factors]{.underline}]{.mark} like other clean technologies such as hydro
and geothermal power. [They can be built anywhere, [and]{.mark} tend to
[face few restrictions]{.mark} due to security or public safety
concerns.]{.underline}

[Wind turbines, solar panels and related components are also being
produced at increasing scale.]{.underline} [Surging]{.underline} solar
[[manufacturing capacity is expected to]{.mark} reach nearly 1,000
gigawatts annually in 2024 -- [double]{.mark} what was produced in
2022.]{.underline}

[Wind and solar are among the cleanest power sources]{.underline}

Once installed, [virtually no greenhouse gases are emitted]{.underline}
as a result of wind and solar power generation, a[nd [they pay
off]{.mark} the [energy related to]{.mark} their [manufacturing and
construction within]{.mark} a matter of [months]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Their existence prevents the continuous burning of fossil fuels for
decades.

Over the course of a typical 3 megawatt wind turbine's 25 year lifespan,
154,484 tonnes of coal would need to be burned to produce the equivalent
amount of power. This would emit around 400,000 tonnes of CO2 into the
atmosphere -- roughly the same as driving an average petrol car around
the equator 50,000 times.

Global power sector emissions would have been 20% higher in 2022 if all
the electricity from wind and solar had instead come from fossil
generation.

\[CHART OMITTED\]

Beyond this decade

Building a global net zero power sector by 2045 -- compatible with the
goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees -- will, as modelled by
the IEA, require the expansion of many types of clean power. But the
necessary near-term solutions for cutting power sector emissions already
exist.

It is possible that technologies currently in development could change
the landscape of what's most efficient for scaling up clean power beyond
2030. But with the speed of transition required, [wind and solar are
crucial for keeping the world on track for 1.5C this
decade]{.underline}.

7\. CONCLUSION [This study explores the feasibility of utilizing [a
multilateral closed-loop geothermal system]{.mark} for seasonal thermal
energy storage [in]{.mark} remote [Arctic
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}, with a focus on Resolute Bay, Nunavut.
The [proposed system [integrates surplus solar energy into]{.mark} the
[subsurface during summer]{.mark} months [and extracts stored heat in
winter, **addressing the seasonal mismatch between renewable**]{.mark}
**[energy supply and heating demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Through
numerical modeling and sensitivity analysis, this study evaluates the
thermal performance, longterm stability, and key design considerations
of the system under Arctic conditions.]{.underline}

The [[results demonstrate]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [hybrid
[geothermal]{.mark} system [with solar]{.mark} heat [injection]{.mark}
[significantly improves seasonal heat retention]{.mark} compared to a
conventional closed-loop geothermal system]{.underline}. The [findings
highlight the following key outcomes:]{.underline}

1.  [Seasonal **[heat storage and extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The
    [[system effectively stores excess]{.mark} thermal [energy]{.mark}
    during summer when solar input is high [and releases it during
    winter]{.mark}, **[ensuring a continuous heat
    supply]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Temperature variations confirm the
    energy cycle, where the system shifts from heat storage
    (June--September) to heat extraction (October--May).]{.underline}

2.  **[[Long-term thermal stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [Over a
    30-year operational period, the system reaches a relatively
    steady-state thermal equilibrium.]{.underline} The [outlet
    temperature stabilizes, [ensuring sustained heating]{.mark} capacity
    [even in extreme winter]{.mark} conditions]{.underline}.

3.  **[Sensitivity to reservoir properties:]{.underline}** [Higher
    initial reservoir temperatures (\>31°C)]{.underline} [improve
    storage efficiency]{.underline}, while formations with moderate to
    high thermal conductivity (3.6--4.8 W/m/K) optimize heat transfer.
    Lower-temperature reservoirs require longer wellbore lengths and
    additional laterals to maintain performance.

4.  **[[Optimized wellbore design]{.underline}]{.mark}**: A [four- to
    five-lateral configuration with 2,200--2,600 m wellbore lengths
    [achieves]{.mark} an **[optimal balance between]{.mark} thermal
    [efficiency and economic
    feasibility]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Increasing lateral
    numbers beyond this threshold yields diminishing returns due to
    thermal interference between adjacent wellbores.

5.  [Comparison with a pure closed-loop geothermal system]{.underline}:
    The [**[hybrid system]{.mark} maintains higher and more stable
    outlet temperatures** compared to a closed-loop geothermal system
    without solar heat injection, **[reducing long-term heat depletion
    and improving thermal sustainability]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

These [findings suggest that]{.underline} **[[integrating solar]{.mark}
energy [with]{.mark} closed-loop [geothermal]{.mark} systems can
[enhance seasonal energy storage, reduce reliance on imported fuels, and
improve energy security]{.mark} in Arctic communities]{.underline}**.
The study underscores the importance of geological site selection,
wellbore design optimization, and adaptive control strategies for
maximizing system efficiency. [Future work should focus on experimental
validation]{.underline} through pilot-scale field implementation,
economic feasibility assessments, and the [[integration of additional
renewable]{.mark} energy sources (e.g., [wind]{.mark} power [or waste
heat]{.mark} recovery)]{.underline} [to [further improve system
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, technoeconomic analyses
should be conducted to evaluate scalability and deployment potential
across other cold-climate regions. In conclusion, the [multilateral
closed-loop geothermal system presents [a viable and sustainable
solution]{.mark} for seasonal thermal energy storage, [contributing
to]{.mark} the **[decarb]{.mark}**onization of Arctic heating
infrastructure [and]{.mark} supporting long-term renewable energy
[transitions]{.mark} in remote off-grid communities.]{.underline}

Introduction

[[Civilization relies on]{.underline}]{.mark} a network of [[highly
interdependent]{.mark} critical infrastructure
(**[CI]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [to provide basic
necessities]{.underline} (water, food, shelter, basic goods), [as well
as complex items]{.underline} (computers, cars, space shuttles) [and
services]{.underline} (the internet, cloud computing, global supply
chains), henceforth referred to as industry. [[Electricity]{.mark}
and]{.underline} the electrical [infrastructure that distributes it
plays an important role within industry]{.underline}, providing [a
convenient means to distribute energy able to be converted into various
forms of useful work]{.underline}. Electricity
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** one component of industry albeit a
**[[critical]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. [[Industry provides the means
to sustain advanced civilization]{.mark}]{.underline} structures and the
citizens that inhabit them. These structures play a critical role in
realizing various futures by [allowing humanity to discover and utilize
new resources, adapt to various environments, [and resist]{.mark}
natural [stressors]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Though industry is capable of resisting small stressors, [**[a]{.mark}
sufficiently [large event can precipitate cascading failure]{.mark} of
CI systems**, [resulting in]{.mark} a [collapse]{.mark} of
industry.]{.underline} If one does not temporally discount the value of
future people, the long-term future (thousands, millions, or even
billions of years) could contain an astronomically large amount of value
\[18\]. Events capable of curtailing the potential of civilization
(existential risks, such as human extinction or an unrecoverable
collapse) would prevent such futures from being achieved, implying
reducing the likelihood of such events is of the utmost importance
\[100\]. Reducing the prevalence of existential risks factors; events,
systemic structures, or biases which increase the likelihood of
extinction but do not cause extinction by themselves is also highly
valuable. [Complete [collapse]{.mark} or degraded function of industry
[would drastically reduce]{.mark} humanity's [capacity to coordinate and
deploy]{.mark} **[tech]{.mark}**nology [to prevent]{.mark}
**[ex]{.mark}**istential **[risks]{.mark}**, representing an existential
risk factor]{.underline}. Consequently, [interventions preventing loss
of industry, reducing the magnitude of impacts, or increasing speed of
recovery could be extremely valuable.]{.underline}

Existential risk research is, by nature, future focused, requiring the
investigation of events that have not yet occurred. Futures studies
methodologies are often applied to uncover salient trends or events, and
explore potential causal structures \[54, 123\]. Probabilistic modeling
techniques can then be used to determine the likelihood of such events
occurring, including adequate treatment of uncertainty \[101\]. The
cost-effectiveness modeling approach outlined in this paper is an
example of this, attempting to assess the marginal utility of losing
industry interventions on improving the long-term future. This approach
could guide future efforts to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of
interventions for different risks, existential or otherwise. More
practically, this research can inform prioritization efforts of
industrialized countries by providing estimates of the cost of global
industrial collapse, and the utility of resilience interventions. This
is relevant to the European Union which has a highly industrialized
economy, providing \$2.3 Trillion USD of the \$13.7 Trillion USD global
total of value add manufacturing \[122\]. The EU has shifted toward a
more proactive foresight approach about natural and man-made disasters,
noting the importance of rare high-impact events, systemic risks, and
converging trends requiring better data and forecasting to drive a more
ambitious crisis management system \[47\]. Still, it is clear that most
academic and institutional emphasis has been on "ordinary" rather than
extreme disasters, and risks from industry to the public and environment
rather than widespread failures of industrial services causing harm.

The [[integrated nature]{.mark} of the electric grid]{.underline}, which
is based on centralized generation [[makes the entire system
vulnerable]{.mark} to disruption]{.underline}.1 There are a number of
[anthropogenic and natural catastrophes that could result
in]{.underline} regional-scale electrical [grid failure, which
would]{.underline} be expected to [halt the majority of industries and
machines in that area.]{.underline} A high-altitude electromagnetic
pulse (HEMP) caused by a nuclear weapon could disable electricity over
part of a continent \[16, 48, 66, 93\]. This could destroy the majority
of electrical grid infrastructure, and as fossil fuel extraction and
industry is reliant on electricity \[49\], industry would be disabled.
Similarly, solar storms have destroyed electrical transformers connected
to long transmission lines in the past \[117\]. The Carrington event in
1859 damaged telegraph lines, which was the only electrical
infrastructure in existence at the time. It also caused Aurora Borealis
that was visible in Cuba and Jamaica \[70\]. This could potentially
disable electrical systems at high latitudes, which could represent 10%
of electricity/industry globally. Though solar storms may last less than
the 12 h that would be required to expose the entire earth with direct
line of sight, the earth's magnetic field lines redirect the storm to
affect the opposite side of the earth \[117\].

Lastly, both [physical]{.underline} \[6, 8, 69, 89, 111\] [and cyber
attacks]{.underline} \[3, 63, 90, 96, 118, 128, 130\] [could also
compromise electric grids]{.underline}. Physical attacks include
traditional acts of terrorism such as bombing or sabotage \[130\] in
addition to EMP attacks. Significant actors could scale up physical
attacks, for example by using drones. A scenario could include terrorist
groups hindering individual power plants \[126\], while [a large
adversary could undertake a]{.underline} similar [operation physically
to all plants and electrical grids in a region.]{.underline}

#### Cyberattacks link nuclear crises -- each is existential, but renewable development solves the incentive to escalate

Resource Competition in the Arctic and Beyond\", Academia,

[Cyber Warfare as a Catalyst]{.underline}: **[[Cyberattacks]{.mark}, a
cross-cutting flashpoint, could [link]{.mark} these
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance, a Russian **[[cyberattack
on Arctic infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g., Norwegian power
grids) could [coincide with Chinese cyberattacks on Taiwan's defense
networks and Iranian attacks on Gulf oil facilities, [creating chaos
across fronts]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Economic Collapse]{.underline}: [Multi-front [conflicts]{.mark} would
[disrupt energy, food, and mineral supplies, triggering global
recessions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The interconnected nature of
[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., 40% of global trade through the
South China Sea, 20% of oil via Hormuz) [[amplifies the
impact]{.underline}]{.mark}, potentially [[destabilizing fragile states
and fueling proxy wars]{.underline}]{.mark} in Africa or South Asia.

Nuclear Risks: The [[strain]{.mark} of multi-front crises could **[lower
nuclear thresholds]{.mark}**, particularly if Russia or China perceive
existential threats]{.underline}. [**[Miscalculations in the
Arctic]{.mark}** (e.g., targeting early-warning systems) [or Middle
East]{.mark} (e.g., Israel-Iran escalation) could **[escalate to
catastrophic levels.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Mitigating Factors and Challenges]{.underline}

Allied Coordination: NATO, the Quad, and AUKUS could pool resources to
manage multi-front threats, but [differing priorities]{.underline}
(e.g., Europe's focus on Ukraine vs. Asia's on Taiwan) [complicate
unity.]{.underline} [Arctic cooperation via the Arctic Council is
weakened by Russia's exit.]{.underline}

[Diplomacy:]{.underline} Crisis hotlines (e.g., U.S.-China, U.S.-Russia)
[aim to prevent miscalculation, but distrust limits
effectiveness]{.underline}. [Regional frameworks]{.underline} (e.g.,
ASEAN, African Union) could address resource conflicts but [lack
enforcement power]{.underline}.

Resilience: **[[Diversifying energy]{.mark} (e.g.,
renewables)]{.underline}** and mineral supplies (e.g., U.S., Australian
rare earths) [[**reduces dependence on Arctic** or Middle East]{.mark}
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but scaling takes years. Cyber
defenses are improving but lag behind offensive capabilities.

Challenges: [Global powers' [zero-sum mindsets and domestic
pressures]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., U.S. election cycles, China's
economic slowdown) [[hinder de-escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Climate change]{.mark}, driving Arctic and resource conflicts,
[remains a]{.mark} slow-burning [amplifier]{.mark} with inadequate
global action]{.underline}**.

In summary, Arctic tensions amplify crises in Ukraine, Taiwan, and the
Middle East by stretching military resources, disrupting economic
stability, and intensifying great power rivalries. Russia's Arctic
militarization could bolster its Ukraine campaign, China's polar
ambitions could align with Taiwan moves, and energy competition could
exacerbate Middle East volatility. [Multi-front
[scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}, [potentially [linked by cyberattacks or
economic shocks]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [risk
overwhelming]{.underline}]{.mark} [global [powers, with **nuclear
escalation a**]{.mark} distant but **[real
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While alliances and diplomacy offer
mitigation, the interconnected nature of these flashpoints demands
coordinated global strategies to prevent cascading conflicts.

#### But, investment in critical infrastructure stabilizes and hedges against hybrid threats 

**Piché 24** (Dr. Rivard Piché is a strategic analyst with Defence
Research and Development Canada. Since joining DRDC in 2016, she worked

Forces Command, August 2024, \"Vulnerabilities and Hybrid Threats in the
North American Arctic\", Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs) -- DOA
6/4/2025, MoState JG

While some experts argue that the Arctic is relatively less vulnerable
to undue foreign influence compared to other regions, the examples
provided above illustrate how the [North American Arctic has evolved
into an arena of strategic competition]{.underline}.38 Here,
[[China---and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} to a lesser
extent---[[endeavor to further their interests at the expense of Canada
and the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}.
**[[Resilience is the best defense]{.mark} against hybrid
threats]{.underline}**. [By identifying vulnerabilities across the North
American Arctic and proactively addressing them, North American leaders
can [deter adversaries]{.mark} from exploiting these vulnerabilities,
thus [fortifying the region against adversarial
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} to counter
hybrid threats [[should focus]{.mark} first and foremost on addressing
vulnerabilities [at their source]{.mark} whenever possible]{.underline}.
**[[Investments in critical infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with
a focus on enhancing service provision and ensuring the safety of Arctic
communities, [[alongside]{.mark} initiatives promoting
[sustainable]{.mark} socioeconomic [development]{.mark}]{.underline} led
by northern communities and Indigenous peoples in collaboration with all
levels of government, [[are paramount]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover,
fostering dialogue around security risks pertaining to economic
security, social cohesion, and democratic values should be central to
any strategy to safeguard the North American Arctic. To that end, the
government of Yukon announced in January 2024 the creation of an Arctic
Security Advisory Council to "study risks across the Yukon security
landscape, determine what assets and infrastructure require additional
protection and identify opportunities for the Government of Yukon to
work with the Government of Canada to enhance security across the
territory."39 This initiative is expected to enhance transparency,
promote dialogue, and enhance security literacy among Yukon
stakeholders, ultimately leading to more informed decision making that
safeguards both homeland defense and the safety and security of Yukon
residents. Furthermore, valuable insights can be drawn from the
Norwegian concept of total defense, which emphasizes the pivotal role of
individuals and communities in defending their country.

-- DOA: 6/5/2025, MoState JG

[[The Arctic is]{.mark} at the forefront of climate change,
[experiencing warming at a rate twice]{.mark} that of [the global
average]{.mark}.]{.underline}2 The region is [rapidly heading towards
consistent seasonal ice-free conditions, with a 12.6 percent reduction
in sea ice over the past forty years]{.underline}.3 Notably, since
[2007, the Northwest Passage (NWP) and the Northern Sea Route (NSR) have
been ice-free in late summer]{.underline}.4 Studies have highlighted
that a decrease in sea ice cover can result in substantial distance
savings, particularly between East Asia and Western Europe. This would
mean up to 30 to 50 percent reduction in travel and goods' transport
time across the NWP and NSR, compared to the Suez Canal.5 Accordingly,
[shipping companies, governments (especially China), and profit-driven
ventures view the NSR as a potential global shipping route]{.underline}
to cut transportation costs.

[While the idea of [using the Arctic]{.mark}---particularly the
[NSR]{.mark}---[for shipping]{.mark} seems promising]{.underline},
[[there are practical challenges]{.mark}. First, sea [ice]{.mark}
conditions within the NSR can [impede transit times]{.mark} [and
impose]{.mark} vessel [limitations]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus
[[elevating]{.mark} shipping [costs]{.mark} and negating the advantages
of economies of scale]{.underline}. Second, the lack of stops along the
NSR results in fewer opportunities for unloading and reloading cargo,
limiting potential profits when compared to the Suez Canal. The
[[challenges]{.mark} the NSR presents [raise uncertainties about]{.mark}
its [superiority]{.mark}]{.underline} over the Suez Canal [[or]{.mark}
its [potential to improve]{.mark} China's export
[competitiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}. This paper employs two key
approaches to comprehend the potential effects of the NSR on Chinese
exports and dispel illusions surrounding the economic feasibility of the
Northern Sea Route in the near realm. First, it assesses the
transportation costs of select Chinese exports using the Suez Canal and
compares them with costs using the NSR under varying sea ice conditions.
Second, the paper conducts a sensitivity analysis test, comparing the
resulting transportation costs for each Chinese export under different
NSR icebreaker scenarios (fees), which depend on the prevailing sea ice
conditions. This test reveals how transportation costs for each examined
export are susceptible to icebreaker fees in comparison to the current
shipping route through the Suez Canal.

This paper focuses on selected Chinese exports: Paint (Organo-inorganic
compound),6 computers,7 and motor vehicles.8 the transportation of these
goods is simulated from Shanghai to Rotterdam, with a deliberate effort
to maintain consistency across numerous variables to ensure an accurate
comparison of routes and goods while also accounting for varying sea ice
conditions. Tree scenarios are considered: Scenario A represents an
ice-free NSR, Scenario B involves a sea ice extent of 25 percent, and
Scenario C entails a sea ice extent of 50 percent.9

Summary of Findings

[[In an ice-free scenario, the NSR emerges as the most
cost-effective]{.mark} option]{.underline}, featuring the lowest unit
transportation costs and delivery prices across paint, computers, and
motor vehicles. [[Under 25 percent]{.mark} sea ice extent conditions,
the NSR [maintains its]{.mark} competitive [edge]{.mark}]{.underline},
offering the lowest unit transportation costs and delivery prices for
motor vehicle exports, and equivalent costs for paint exports, compared
to the Suez Canal. However, for computer exports, the Suez Canal proves
to be the optimal choice when compared to the NSR with 25 percent and 50
percent sea ice conditions, offering lower unit transportation costs and
delivery prices.

These [findings [delineate]{.mark} the [threshold at which
melted]{.mark} sea [ice]{.mark} in the Arctic [renders the NSR]{.mark} a
[cost-efficient and competitive]{.mark} route]{.underline} compared to
the Suez Canal, along with identifying the specific types of goods that
would be advantageous for exportation via the NSR. A generalization
across the analyzed goods suggests that the [NSR becomes economically
viable when sea ice extent is around 25 percent]{.underline} and even
then, only certain goods---in the present analysis, motor vehicles and
potentially paint---exhibit competitive unit costs and delivery prices
to the Suez Canal.

This paper is organized into three sections to comprehensively address
the intricate aspects of transportation costs, delivery prices, and the
overall impact on China's export competitiveness. Its organization and
methodology are inspired by Shelton Metcalf's master's thesis at The
Fletcher School, which explored U.S. export competitiveness under the
Panama Canal expansion in 2013.10

Prediction of Route Changes and Navigation Potential before Mid-21st
Century" Accessed ^9.26.2024^///**mosuQ**

The [[rise in Arctic temperatures]{.mark} has [intensified]{.mark} the
[melting and retreat of sea ice]{.mark}, the reduction in snow cover,
and the [thawing]{.mark} of permafrost in the Arctic region]{.underline}
\[ 3-- 6\]. The areas of sea that have been covered by thick ice
year-round are gradually transforming into ice-free or thin-ice regions.
The rate of decline in Arctic sea ice extent in September has a range
from 0.015 × 106 km2/year to 0.049 × 106 km2/year during 1979--1998 but
has accelerated to the range from 0.116 × 106 km2/year to 0.192 × 106
km2/year during 1999--2010 \[7, 8\]. During 2013--2019, the mean annual
extent of Arctic sea ice decreased from 9.23 × 106 km2 to 8.51 × 106
km2, with an annual decline rate of 1.34% \[9\]. In addition, [Arctic
[sea ice thickness]{.mark} is also [experiencing rapid
changes]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to satellite data, between 2003
and 2018, the volume of Arctic sea ice decreased by 5130 km3 per decade
during the autumn and by 2870 km3 per decade during the winter.
Furthermore, the mean sea ice thickness in some areas of the Arctic
decreased by 2 m over a period of 60 years (1958--2018) \[ 10 \]. [The
[reduction]{.mark} in sea ice thickness and coverage in the Arctic
region [has led to a continuous increase in open water areas]{.mark} and
an extension of the summer melting season. Therefore, the [Arctic
shipping routes have a longer navigational period, greatly enhancing
their navigational potential]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}\[ 11 ,12 \].
The development of Arctic shipping routes has close connections with the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Climate Action, Life
Below Water, and Affordable and Clean Energy \[13\]. [[The Arctic
Passage]{.mark}, which connects the North Pacific and the North
Atlantic, [serves as a maritime shortcut]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}\[14 \]. [It is typically separated into the **Northern Sea
Route** (NSR), the Northwest Passage (NWP), and the Transpolar Sea Route
(TSR) that crosses the North Pole. The Northern Sea Route is along the
offshore waters of northern Russia, connecting Asia and
Europe.]{.underline} [It is the least ice-covered and most navigable of
the three Arctic rout]{.underline}es and is divided into four routes by
latitude: low-latitude, mid-latitude, high-latitude, and near-polar
routes \[15 -- 17\]. Compared to the traditional Suez Canal route, the
Northern Sea Route can shorten the journey by 15% to 50% \[ 18 -- 22\].
The Transpolar Sea Route, which crosses the North Pole, is the shortest
sea route connecting the North Pacific and North Atlantic \[ 19 \], but
it is often heavily ice-covered, making navigation difficult, and
currently has low feasibility for navigation. The Northwest Passage is
along the Arctic coast of Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and
the Davis Strait, connecting Asia and eastern North America. In 2020,
the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment Working Group released
the Arctic shipping status report, which suggested that Arctic shipping
had increased by 25% from 2013 to 2019 \[23 ,24 \]. Against the
background of global climate change, the future planning and
navigational potential of the Arctic shipping routes will be of great
concern. Compared with the Northern Sea Route, the Northwest Passage has
heavier sea ice conditions and less developed navigation infrastructure,
making it more difficult to navigate \[ 18 , 19\]. In addition, the
Canadian Arctic Archipelago has complex coastlines, narrow waterways,
and limited spatiotemporal observed sea ice data in the region.
Furthermore, the Transpolar Sea Route is adjacent to the near-polar
route of the Northern Sea Route. Therefore, this study focuses on the
Northern Sea Route, which currently has the highest navigability, and
the Transpolar Sea Route, which has the greatest potential for future
navigation, to conduct research on future route changes and navigation
potential estimation. Currently, most studies of Arctic sea ice and
Arctic shipping prediction rely on models \[18 , 25-- 38\]. The Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) has gathered the latest
prediction data of climate models. It is better suited to the current
global warming background than the CMIP5 model data due to the
incorporation of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) \[ 37 \]. The
Arctic sea ice prediction data provided by CMIP6 under various scenarios
can reduce the uncertainty of future prediction data and better
represent the changing trend of Arctic sea ice in the future. Sea ice
concentration and thickness are two important parameters for planning
Arctic shipping routes and assessing navigational potential, and their
accuracy significantly affects the reliability of future estimates for
Arctic shipping. However, there has been limited research on the
accuracy of CMIP6 sea ice data. Watts et al. conducted an evaluation of
the historical data of sea ice concentration and thickness between 1979
and 2014 from 13 CMIP6 climate models, utilizing ICESat and CryoSat-2
satellite data \[ 35\]. Similarly, Shen et al. compared the sea ice
concentration historical data of CMIP6 and CMIP5 with observational data
and evaluated the performance of 36 CMIP6 models during 1979--2014 \[
38\]. Both studies presented a clear demonstration of the differences
between CMIP6 models and observational data, enabling a comprehensive
assessment of their performance. In addition, the current studies
related to Arctic shipping routes based on CMIP6 sea ice data are
primarily conducted using the multi-model mean (MMM). Li et al. con-
ducted an assessment of the navigability of Arctic shipping routes from
2015 to 2065 using 16 models \[29 \]. Their findings revealed that three
feasible shipping scenarios demonstrated a significant reduction in
navigation risk starting from 2045, but this result was only applicable
to the SSP5-8.5 scenario (very high greenhouse gas emissions: CO2
emissions triple by 2075). Chen et al. predicted a significant increase
and extension of navigable areas and navigable windows during
2045--2055, but further navigability assessments were lacking \[27 \].
Wei et al. conducted an analysis of the navigation probability and route
changes of the Arctic Passage by the end of the 21st century using the
Arctic Transport Accessibility Model (ATAM) \[ 36 \]. Their study
utilized the MMM to predict the future conditions of the Arctic under
the SSP2-4.5 (intermediate GHG emissions: CO2 emissions around current
levels until 2050, then falling but not reaching net zero by 2100) and
SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The study predicted that the Arctic will be ice-free
in September by 2076 and 2055 under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios,
respectively, enabling navigation through the Transpolar Sea Route. Min
et al. conducted an analysis of the changes in the navigation potential
of Arctic shipping between 2021 and 2100 using the ATAM \[ 31\]. The
results of the study, based on the MMM, indicated that the navigable
area for Open Water (OW) and Polar Class 6 (PC6) is expected to continue
to increase in September before 2050 under both the SSP2-4.5 and
SSP5-8.5 scenarios. However, similar to the study of Wei et al. \[ 36
\], both studies did not conduct further detailed analysis of route
planning. Moreover, the results of the MMM do not clearly depict the
route planning and navigation potential evaluation results of different
models, and they are also inadequate for comparing the similarities and
differences between the results of different models. Furthermore, the
sea ice thickness division of ATAM, which has been commonly employed in
previous studies, is relatively coarse. In this study, the seven models
with better performances were selected based on the sea ice
concentration and thickness data evaluation results of various models in
CMIP6 from Watts et al. \[35 \] and Shen et al. \[ 38\], and the
CMCC-ESM2 model with relatively large differences of sea ice
concentration and thickness was also added as a comparison. Based on the
Polar Operational Limit Assessment Risk Indexing System (POLARIS) with
more detailed sea ice thickness classification (IMO, 2016), the
navigational risk of each model was quantified under two scenarios
(SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5), represented by two types of vessels, Open Water
(OW) and Polar Class 6 (PC6), and the navigability of each model was
evaluated and analyzed from multiple perspectives to find out the
similarities and differences between the models and to comprehensively
predict the changes in Arctic shipping routes and navigability potential
in the next 30 years. 2. Data and Methods 2.1. CMIP6 Sea Ice Data Based
on the evaluation results of sea ice concentration and thickness from
Watts et al. \[ 35\] and Shen et al. \[ 38 \], this study utilizes
monthly sea ice concentration and thickness data with the better
performances obtained from seven climate models, including ACCESS-
ESM1-5, CESM2-WACCM, EC-Earth3-CC, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, NorESM2-MM,
and UKESM1-0-LL. The CMCC-ESM2 model with smaller simulation results of
sea ice concentration and thickness was additionally utilized as a
comparison (Table 1). CMIP6 data show that [[there will be completely
ice-free months]{.mark} in the Arctic **[before
2050]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[ 39 \], [and [**30 years before**]{.mark}
2050 [is the period with the **largest change in navigation
potential**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[ 29, 33 \]. Therefore, this study
focuses on the period between 2021 and 2050, [[with a particular
emphasis on the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
Transpolar Sea Route (Figure 1). The SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios are
selected for this research. Due to the difference in grid resolution in
the CMIP6 models, we employed the inverse distance weighting (IDW)
interpolation technique to convert the model data grids into a
consistent grid size with a resolution of 12.5 km × 12.5 km.

[[The]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, once dominated by scientific
and environmental concerns, [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[become]{.mark} [the domain for military and economic
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Initiatives such as the International
Polar Years, with the first held in 1882--1883, exemplify the long
standing emphasis on scientific exploration in the region. [[Russia
remains]{.underline}]{.mark} 14 the most
[[established]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic power,
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[monopoly on (emerging) trade
routes]{.mark},]{.underline} a [significant icebreaker fleet,
[and]{.mark} geographic [proximity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This means an
advantageous position incase of a conflict,]{.underline} especially in
the initial 15 phase, being able to mobilise assets rapidly in the first
24 hours as supported by Zimmermann's analysis. 16 However, [in the
maturing phase of a conflict, this advantage is [offset by
**NATO**]{.mark}'s superior logistical capabilities,]{.underline} which
allows them [to scale and sustain an upper hand over an extended
period]{.underline}. This [[imbalance]{.underline}]{.mark} proves to be
a reason for discussion, as [each side's defensive measures are threats
to each other]{.underline}. The [showing]{.underline}-o [[between NATO,
Russia, and]{.mark} [emerging influences like China
underscores]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[need for a balanced, cooperative
approach to the Arctic]{.mark}. [China's entry]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[with a]{.mark} singular [warship]{.mark} into the Arctic Ocean
[marks]{.mark} [a new phase in **i**]{.mark}nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations [and increases tension]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even
though [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} is not an Arctic state, it has
[[declared]{.mark} [itself]{.mark} a]{.underline}
"[[near-Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} [state]{.underline}" [proven
by]{.underline} its significant [investments in the Polar Silk Road
Initiative]{.underline}. [[This creates precedence for]{.underline}
[other]{.underline}]{.mark} [geographically indirect]{.underline}
[[states to claim]{.mark} [justification for entry]{.mark} into the
region as engagement is no longer isolated to geographic
proximity]{.underline}. The **[[coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration
[[between Russia and China]{.underline}]{.mark}, [economically and
militarily]{.underline} 21 [[forms]{.mark} an increasing [risk]{.mark}
[for NATO's long-term planning]{.mark}]{.underline} and potentially
threatens their maturity phase overhand in case of conflict. China as of
2020 had a total navy battle force count of 360 to the United States 296
and by 2030 China is projected to increase to a total of 425 and the
United States to 290. This projected 135-ship difference, though across
different classes and likely quality, changes the domain and aids in
equalizing Russo-Sino leverage in negotiations with NATO. [It is
becoming a multipolar balance of power]{.underline} denied by a lack of
a singular state or alliance able to exert total authority. The
**[[increasing]{.mark} (joint) [exercises]{.mark} [and asset
developments increase]{.mark} the [likelihood of accidents or
miscalculations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As highlighted by Zimmerman,
**[[especially around the]{.mark} GIUK-N [Gap and Northern Sea
Route]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[even minor incidents]{.mark} can
[result in escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[Near-misses]{.underline}]{.mark} in military maneuvers, [such as the
2019 near-collision between Russian and U.S. naval vessels]{.underline}
in the Bering Sea, [[underscore the need]{.mark} to

Accessed 5.23.2025 // ***mosuQ***\]

As the Munich Security Conference gets underway, [the spectre of [a
**third world war** looms on the **horizon**]{.mark}. Military and
political leaders in **NATO** nations have issued chilling warnings for
populations to brace for [the possibility of **devastating superpower
conflict**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Admiral Rob Bauer, chair of NATO's Military Committee, fired the opening
salvo in the grim round of predictions. He cautioned that Russia could
launch an attack within the next two decades. In words reminiscent of
World War II, Bauer urged allied countries to mobilise citizen armies.

British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has gone even further, foreseeing
[potential wars [involving]{.mark} **China**, **[Russia]{.mark}**, North
Korea and Iran [within the **next five years**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
situation is transitioning "from a post-war to pre-war world", he
asserted bleakly.

General Sir Patrick Sanders, the UK's army chief, echoed that dark
prediction. He described the British population as a "pre-war
generation" that may need to prepare for conflict with an increasingly
aggressive Russia.

German politicians and military leaders have discussed resurrecting
mandatory military service in response to growing threats and Sweden has
already introduced a form of national service as it closes in on NATO
membership.

To many, the idea that increased tensions sparked by Russia's attacks on
Ukraine could lurch towards a wider European conflict seems not only
probable but inevitable.

However, amid the drumbeats of international conflict, [one crucial
factor is being overlooked: the impact of **climate change** as a
potential **trigger for war**.]{.underline}

NATO has committed to taking a leading international role on climate and
security. Yet the landmark climate agreement reached late last year at
the COP28 conference in Dubai underscores the need for Western leaders
meeting in Munich to raise their climate ambitions and translate them
into tangible action.

[NATO recognises climate change as a **'threat amplifier'** for
traditional security issues, but it needs to go further as studies
indicate **global [warming]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} already [**rapidly
accelerating** the **likelihood of armed conflict**]{.mark}, especially
[in the **Arctic**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Arctic **icecaps**]{.mark} **are [melting]{.mark}** at record rates,
making deposits of gas, oil and minerals worth trillions of dollars
accessible for the first time. Over the coming years, this [will **spark
a race** for Arctic dominance]{.mark} that **Russia** is hellbent on
winning.]{.underline}

[With Russia holding over 53% of the Arctic Ocean coastline, **Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}** [believes]{.mark} **domination** of [the
region]{.mark}'s resources [is **critical** to the]{.mark} economic
[**survival** of his **regime**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Arctic is
estimated to hold 412 billion barrels of oil and gas, about 22% of the
world's undiscovered reserves.

[Putin is hardly trying to hide his agenda. [Russia]{.mark} already
[operates]{.mark} a third [more Arctic **military bases** than the
**US** and]{.mark} its **[NATO]{.mark}** allies. [Now Putin is]{.mark}
moving soldiers, icebreakers, warships and submarines to the region, as
well as [conducting Arctic drills that test hypersonic missiles capable
of **evading American defences**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

His propaganda machine regularly releases pictures of troops training in
white fatigues and clutching assault weapons as they zip over the snow
on sleighs pulled by reindeer.

America and Denmark have filed sovereignty claims in the central Arctic
Ocean but it was Moscow that, in 2007, planted a titanium Russian flag
on the seabed two-and-a-half miles under the North Pole.

[More [aggressive Russian claims in the Arctic could **force NATO to
act** and]{.mark} risk **[spark]{.mark}ing** the **[global
conflict]{.mark}** that the generals and politicians are warning of.
While traditional military preparations for global war are undoubtedly
vital, [leaders]{.mark} convening at Munich [must]{.mark} also
[**prioritise climate action** to mitigate]{.mark} the risk of global
warming becoming the **catalyst** for a **[catastrophic
clash]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Following the COP28 agreement to 'transition away from fossil fuels',
NATO must modify its climate ambitions and let the consensus reached in
Dubai guide its strategy to head off the threat of global war provoked
by climate change.

The Dubai agreement has been endorsed by 198 countries, including NATO
allies. However, in the words of COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, who is
also attending the Munich conference: "An agreement is only as good as
its implementation ... We must take the steps necessary to turn this
agreement into tangible action."

NATO's focus should extend beyond its current voluntary emissions
reduction targets to include COP28's agreement to triple renewable
energy capacity by 2030.

[Since **[halting Arctic warming is pivotal to preventing]{.mark}
conflict**, NATO must also explore safe geoengineering solutions to slow
or reverse Arctic melting.]{.underline}

[It is time for world leaders to act in the knowledge that failure to
urgently address the climate emergency exposes the world to the risk of
[a **devastating conflict between NATO and Russia**]{.mark}, as well as
the wider **environmental dangers** of unchecked climate
change.]{.underline}

#### Arctic tensions escalate to global war and amplify all other flashpoints

5\. Interconnected Risks and Global Dynamics [Global flashpoints do not
exist in isolation; they are interconnected through alliances, economic
dependencies, and strategic rivalries]{.underline}. A [crisis in one
region can amplify tensions elsewhere, creating multi-front conflict
scenarios that strain global powers and risk broader
escalation]{.underline}. [[The **Arctic**]{.mark}**, as a microcosm of
resource competition and great power rivalry, [serves as a critical
node]{.mark}** in this interconnected web.]{.underline}

5.1 Multi-Front Conflict Scenarios: How Arctic Tensions Amplify Ukraine,
Taiwan, or Middle East Crises [**The Arctic, [with]{.mark} its [melting
ice unlocking]{.mark} vast [resources and]{.mark} strategic [routes, is
a theater of competition among the U.S., Russia, China, and NATO]{.mark}
allies**. **[Tensions here]{.mark} can [exacerbate crises in other
flashpoints]{.mark}**---Ukraine, Taiwan, and the Middle East---by
stretching military resources, disrupting economic stability, and
intensifying great power rivalries]{.underline}. Below, we explore how
Arctic dynamics interact with these regions, [creating multi-front
risks]{.underline}.

Arctic as a Strategic Amplifier Geopolitical Context: The [Arctic holds
13% of the world's undiscovered [oil]{.mark}, 30% of [natural gas,
and]{.mark} critical [minerals]{.mark} like rare earths[, making it a
prize]{.mark} for energy and tech-dependent powers]{.underline}. The
[**[N]{.mark}**orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea **[R]{.mark}**oute [and
Northwest Passage,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[opened by ice
melt]{.mark},** [promise faster shipping]{.mark}, reshaping global
trade. [Russia militarizes]{.mark} its [Arctic coast, China
invests]{.mark} in polar infrastructure, [and NATO]{.mark} (bolstered by
Finland and Sweden) [enhances its presence, creating a]{.mark} tense
[standoff]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Mechanisms of Amplification: Resource Competition]{.underline}: [Arctic
oil, gas, and minerals are vital for global supply chains. A [scramble
for control]{.mark} could [divert resources]{.mark} and [attention from
other crises, weakening responses]{.mark} elsewhere.]{.underline}

[Military Stretching: Arctic tensions require naval, air, and cyber
deployments, straining U.S. and NATO forces already committed to
Ukraine, Taiwan, or the Middle East]{.underline}.

[Alliance Dynamics: Russia-China cooperation in the Arctic (e.g., joint
patrols) could align their strategies in other theaters, while NATO's
Arctic focus might [reduce cohesion]{.mark} in addressing non-European
crises.]{.underline}

Economic Disruptions: [Arctic [incidents]{.mark} (e.g., sabotage of
shipping routes) could [spike]{.mark} energy and mineral
[prices]{.mark}, [compounding economic pressures]{.mark} from other
conflicts]{.underline}.

#### That escalates \-- first flashpoint is Ukraine

**Win 25** (Htein Win, PhD in Myanmar Language, postgraduate in
education management, Faculty of Language at University of East Yangon,

Resource Competition in the Arctic and Beyond\", Academia,
http://bit.ly/4kYNRIJ) -- DOA: 6/5/24, MoState JG

Arctic Tensions and [Ukraine]{.underline}

[Interconnection]{.underline}: [Russia's Arctic militarization is
closely tied to its war in Ukraine]{.underline}. The Arctic provides
[economic lifelines]{.underline} (e.g., Yamal LNG exports) to [offset
Western sanctions]{.underline}, while Ukraine diverts Russia's
conventional forces, limiting its Arctic deployments. However[,
[Arctic]{.mark} tensions could [amplify]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark}
crisis in several ways]{.underline}:

[[Resource Diversion]{.mark}:]{.underline} A [Russia-NATO confrontation
in the Arctic]{.underline} (e.g., over Norwegian oil platforms) could
[pull U.S. and European resources]{.underline} (e.g., [naval assets,
intelligence) from supporting Ukraine, [weakening Kyiv]{.mark}'s defense
against Russian advances]{.underline}.

[Escalation Dynamics]{.underline}: [[Russian **cyberattacks or hybrid
actions**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline} (e.g., cutting undersea
cables, as suspected in the 2024 Baltic Sea incidents) could [coincide
with intensified offensives in Ukraine, testing NATO's ability to
respond]{.underline} on two fronts. [This could embolden Russia to
**[escalate nuclear rhetoric]{.mark}** or hybrid warfare in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}.

China's Role: [[China's Arctic investments]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.,
with Russia's Rosneft) [[strengthen Moscow]{.mark}'s war economy,
indirectly sustaining its Ukraine campaign]{.underline}. A U.S.-China
clash over Arctic minerals could align China more overtly with Russia,
complicating NATO's strategy.

[Multi-Front Risk]{.underline}: A [simultaneous [Arctic-Ukraine]{.mark}
crisis could [overwhelm NATO's eastern flank]{.mark}]{.underline},
especially if Russia coordinates Arctic provocations with Belarusian or
Kaliningrad-based actions. The [U.S.]{.underline}, already supplying
Ukraine with billions in aid, might [struggle to deploy additional
forces to the Arctic]{.underline}, [[risking miscalculation or
escalation]{.mark} to a broader NATO-Russia conflict.]{.underline}

#### Second, Taiwan 

**Win 25** (Htein Win, PhD in Myanmar Language, postgraduate in

Resource Competition in the Arctic and Beyond\", Academia,
http://bit.ly/4kYNRIJ) -- DOA: 6/5/24, MoState JG

[Arctic Tensions and Taiwan]{.underline}

[Interconnection]{.underline}: The [[Arctic and Taiwan are linked
through U.S.-China rivalry and]{.mark} global [supply
chains]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Taiwan's]{.underline} dominance in
[semiconductors]{.underline} ([60% of global supply) is critical for
Arctic mining and shipping technologies, while Arctic minerals are vital
for chip production]{.underline}. Arctic [tensions could amplify a
Taiwan crisis]{.underline} as follows:

[Strategic Distraction:]{.underline} A [U.S.-Russia Arctic
[standoff]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., over territorial claims) could
[[divert]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. naval and air
[[assets]{.underline}]{.mark} from the Indo-Pacific, [[weakening
deterrence against]{.mark} a Chinese [invasion]{.mark} or blockade of
Taiwan]{.underline}. The [U.S. Navy,]{.underline} already stretched
across Atlantic and Pacific theaters, [faces capacity
constraints]{.underline}.

[China's [Opportunism]{.mark}:]{.underline} [China could
[exploit]{.mark} Arctic [tensions]{.mark} to advance its Taiwan agenda,
[timing]{.mark} military [exercises or]{.mark} a [blockade]{.mark} to
coincide with U.S. preoccupation in the Arctic]{.underline}. Russia's
Arctic alignment with China (e.g., joint resource projects) could
embolden Beijing, creating a coordinated challenge across two fronts.

[Economic Linkages: An [Arctic]{.mark} crisis disrupting mineral
supplies (e.g., rare earths) could exacerbate global chip shortages,
[amplifying]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[economic stakes]{.mark} of a
Taiwan conflict]{.underline}. Conversely, a [Taiwan Strait closure would
disrupt Arctic technology supply chains, delaying mining and shipping
projects]{.underline}.

[Multi-Front Risk: A simultaneous Arctic-Taiwan crisis would
[strain]{.mark} U.S. [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}, forcing Japan,
Australia, and NATO to prioritize between Indo-Pacific and Arctic
commitments. [China and Russia could exploit this, with China escalating
in Taiwan and Russia intensifying Arctic or Ukraine actions,
[risking]{.mark} a [two-theater war]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### Third, the Middle East: specifically Iran and Russia 

**Win 25** (Htein Win, PhD in Myanmar Language, postgraduate in
education management, Faculty of Language at University of East Yangon,
2025, \"Flashpoints of a Third World War: Geopolitical Rivalries and
Resource Competition in the Arctic and Beyond\", Academia,
http://bit.ly/4kYNRIJ) -- DOA: 6/5/24, MoState JG

[Arctic Tensions and the Middle East Interconnection]{.underline}: The
[[Middle East and Arctic are linked through energy]{.mark} markets [and
great power influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Arctic oil and gas could
offset Middle East supply disruptions, but [competition for Arctic
resources complicates Middle East stability,]{.mark} particularly around
Iran's nuclear ambitions]{.underline} [and the Strait of
Hormuz.]{.underline}

[Energy Market Volatility]{.underline}: An Arctic
[[incident]{.underline}]{.mark} ([e.g., Russian sabotage of Norwegian
gas fields]{.underline}) could [[spike]{.mark} global [energy
prices]{.mark}, compounding disruptions from a Middle East
conflict]{.underline} (e.g., an Iranian blockade of the Strait of
Hormuz). This would hit energy-dependent Europe and Asia hard, [[fueling
economic crises and unrest]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Iran-Russia Nexus: Russia's Arctic ambitions rely on revenue from
energy exports]{.underline}, some of which fund its Middle East
activities, [including support for Iran]{.underline} (e.g., S-300
systems). [An [Arctic crisis]{.mark} could [push Russia to deepen ties
with Iran, coordinating cyberattacks or proxy actions]{.mark} against
U.S. and Israeli targets in the Middle East]{.underline}.

[U.S. Overstretch: A [U.S. response to Arctic tensions]{.mark}
(]{.underline}e.g., deploying the Second Fleet) could [[reduce]{.mark}
its [Gulf presence, emboldening Iran to escalate nuclear
activities]{.mark} or proxy attacks.]{.underline} Conversely, [a
U.S.-Iran conflict would limit Arctic patrols, allowing Russia and China
to expand influence]{.underline}.

Multi-Front Risk: An [[Arctic-Middle East crisis]{.mark} could
[create]{.mark} a global [energy chokehold]{.mark}, with Arctic and
Hormuz disruptions driving oil prices to \$200 per barrel]{.underline}.
Russia and China could [exploit U.S. focus on the Middle East to advance
Arctic claims, while Iran's proxies escalate, [risking a regional war
with global]{.mark} economic [fallout]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Broader Multi-Front Scenarios Synchronized Crises: The most dangerous
scenario involves simultaneous crises across multiple flashpoints,
orchestrated or opportunistic. For example:

Russia escalates in Ukraine and the Arctic (e.g., cutting cables,
seizing disputed zones).

China intensifies pressure on Taiwan, conducting a blockade or invasion.

Iran, backed by Russia, advances its nuclear program or disrupts the
Strait of Hormuz.

Such a scenario would overwhelm U.S. and NATO resources, forcing
prioritization and exposing vulnerabilities in allies like Japan or the
EU.

### Inherency \-- SQ is Diesel Dependent

#### Diesel is nearly exclusive in the SQ -- volatility and disruption result

The transition to clean energy in remote communities is a natural
response to the closely linked relationship between energy and
sovereignty. [[Because many remote energy systems are powered **almost
exclusively by imported** **diesel**]{.mark}]{.underline} fuel,
[[communities are often exposed to **fuel price
volatility**]{.underline}]{.mark} that is triggered by external forces
[[outside]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[their control, this includes
**disruptions** to fuel supply chains caused by]{.underline}]{.mark}
changing [[weather]{.underline}]{.mark} patterns due to climate change.
[[This **volatility** demonstrates how important it is to develop
systems that are resilient and reliable]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In terms of costs, [[the 100% RE system is]{.underline}]{.mark} found to
be [[lower in total]{.underline}]{.mark} annualised [[cost
than]{.underline}]{.mark} the current [[fossil]{.underline}]{.mark}
fuels-based system, as indicated in Fig. 5. The current cost structure
is heavily dependent on fuel costs, which constitute 68% of the total
annualised cost, making Greenland very vulnerable to changes in [[fuel
prices on the global markets]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, with the
transition to a 100% RE system, the cost structure changes from being
dominated by variable cost to an investment-based system where capex
make up almost 75% of the total annualised cost in 2050. The 100%
[[RE]{.underline}]{.mark} system [[enables a 31%
reduction]{.underline}]{.mark} in total annualised costs in 2050
compared to 2019. Costs per unit of final energy decrease by 23% from
85.2 €/MWh to 66.6 €/MWh during the same period.

[[A full transition]{.underline}]{.mark} from fossil fuels to RE sources
[[requires large capital expenditures]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
upcoming decades, increasing three-fold from 2019 to 2050. As shown in
Fig. 5, 62% of the total annualised investments are allocated to
electricity generation technologies, mainly wind power plants and
hydropower plants, where annual investments reach 36 m€ and 20 m€,
respectively. The remainder of investments is required for storage, heat
generation, and fuel synthesis technologies such as DAC units and
electrolysers.

Pembina Institute's Renewables in Remote Communities program is about

In [[remote]{.underline}]{.mark} regions across Canada, communities,

from 2015-2020, [[renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark} projects in

only **[[possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but it is also happening in
communities across Canada.

[[Though]{.underline}]{.mark} these findings are encouraging, [[many
**regulatory, policy, and technical barriers** remain and pose a **real
threat** to **continued gains** in diesel
reduction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Today, with increasing [[economic
instability]{.underline}]{.mark}, intensifying
[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark} [[disasters, and]{.underline}]{.mark}
changing [[labour]{.underline}]{.mark} conditions, it [[is becoming ever
more challenging for **communities** ]{.mark}**to begin**]{.underline}
their [[clean energy]{.underline}]{.mark} journey. For progress to
continue at the pace and scale required to meet community, climate and
energy goals, a lot has to change -- and fast.

We found only a [[few mentions of niche development]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the strategies. This [[does not]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[niches are not
developed]{.underline}]{.mark} or supported in the Finnish and Norwegian
Arctic areas; [[rather, the energy sector simply has not been treated
with **Arctic specifics**]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in Finland.
This was discussed in the interviews, where the pressure exerted by the
energy transition is on national and EU policymaking. We estimate that
the energy sector was not of interest in [[policymaking related to
**specifically Arctic issues**]{.underline}]{.mark} and that Finnish
interests in the Arctic are less developed and refined than their
Norwegian counterparts. In light of contemporary renewable energy
development projects in Finnish Lapland, perhaps this [[should
change]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[with a **more comprehensive take on
Arctic policy** implemented]{.underline}]{.mark}. This would of course
require Finland to take a stronger stance on Arctic policy in general,
as at least until the most recent strategy (2021) the aims have not been
clear, despite significant efforts to justify Finland as an Arctic
state. At the time of the writing, this remains the latest update on
Arctic policy. Although NATO was not strongly present in the data, we
expect that [[Finland\'s recent NATO membership will change that in the
future]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps towards more emphasis on the
negative security thinking, as Finland brings significant land and air
force assets to NATO in the Arctic. In turn, the establishment of the
Sámi Climate Council in 2023 enshrined in the revised Finnish Climate
Act, creates an improved opportunity to link positive security to the
energy transitions. Meanwhile, Norway continues to use its own
definition of sustainable development, one that includes oil and gas
production \[75\].

transition (RET) environmental governance (EVG) Rapid urbanization
transition (URT)

5.2. Policy Directions. In accordance with the research findings, the
enumerated point is suggested [[to promote environmental quality in the
Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, to address the positive
influence of EPU on CEM, [[this research proposes that members in the
Arctic countries can establish a coordinated initiative to promote green
investments during periods of economic uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Thus, [[these countries' policy-makers and governments can provide
subsidies, tax breaks, and incentives for]{.underline}]{.mark}
individuals and businesses who invest in [[sustainable infrastructure
and cleaner power supply]{.underline}]{.mark} for their activities. By
doing so, EPU can drive increased interest and funding in clean power
alternatives and solutions, ultimately contributing to lower CEM.
Second, the empirical output captured that EVT helps eradicate
environmental pollution. Thus, the result necessitates that increased
[[investment and advocacy of green]{.underline}]{.mark} and ecological
[[innovation should be included in strategic approaches of the Arctic
nations]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition, [[there is an urgent need to
encourage]{.underline}]{.mark} research and
[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} in environmental technologies designed
to dissipate CEM in the Arctic. Support initiatives focusing on
developing cleaner transportation options for rural centers, sustainable
agriculture programs, and carbon capture and storage technologies
[[tailored to the Arctic nations' unique
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}. This innovation can be facilitated by
cooperation between academic institutions, industrial partners, and
member states of the Arctic Council.

Third, [[because RET has a beneficial influence on
CEM]{.underline}]{.mark}, this research suggests that
[[nations]{.underline}]{.mark} globally and, [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, economies [[should provide consistent and
clear incentives and policies for renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark}
projects. In addition, [[stakeholders and
governments]{.underline}]{.mark} in these countries should [[develop a
comprehensive and region-specific RET plan]{.underline}]{.mark} for the
member council [[in the Arctic nations. This]{.underline}]{.mark} plan
[[should prioritize]{.underline}]{.mark} using cleaner power sources
such as [[solar]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[hydro]{.underline}]{.mark}electric power, [[and
wind]{.underline}]{.mark}, which have lower CEM than conventional ones.
In addition, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} plan [[should include measures
to reduce the ecological effect of RET projects]{.underline}]{.mark},
such as conducting thorough environmental impact assessments and
ensuring responsible infrastructure and development. Fourth, [[the
Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} member states [[must prioritize
sustainable urban planning]{.underline}]{.mark} and design projects
encouraging small, energy-efficient cities. Policies like [mixed-use
zoning, effective public transit, and green building]{.underline}
standards can decrease energy consumption and CEMs related to urban
growth. Furthermore, encouraging Arctic urban regions to embrace
renewable energy sources for transportation, heating, and cooling will
substantially decrease (CO2) production.

The research findings highlighted EVG's negative and substantial
iteration influence on the connection between EPU and CEM. Accordingly,
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} paper [[recommends]{.underline}]{.mark} that
these [[council member states work together to harmonize EVG policies
related to CEM]{.underline}]{.mark}. This paper suggests a "[[green
investment incentive program]{.underline}]{.mark}." This initiative
[[could provide financial support]{.underline}]{.mark} to enterprises
and industries that invest in low-carbon technologies and practices by
offering financial support [[and grants for green, cleaner
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[creating economic stability
through sustainable growth]{.underline}]{.mark}. This approach can help
address environmental concerns and alleviate EPU by providing clear
incentives for businesses to transition toward ecologically friendly
tools, [[ultimately reducing CEM levels in the Arctic
region]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Accordingly, this research addresses these questions: (RQ1) How does EPU
affect CEM among the Arctic Council? (RQ2) How do RET, URT, and EVT
drive CEM in these regions? (3) What is the moderating role of EVG on
the interplay between EPU and CEM abatement in this nation? The
originality and novelty of this study dwell in its thorough exploration
of multiple factors influencing CEM [[within the Arctic
context]{.underline}]{.mark}. By integrating these indicators into a
research framework, the study offers a holistic perspective on the
region's sustainability challenges. Furthermore, the exploration of EVG
as a moderating indicator adds depth to the analysis, acknowledging the
significance of successful systems for policies in advancing ecological
stability. The [[Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, as a cooperative
intergovernmental forum, [[provides a suitable **platform**
for]{.underline}]{.mark} addressing environmental concerns
collaboratively, [[making]{.underline}]{.mark} this
[[research]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly [[relevant for shaping
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} recommendations that can be implemented
[[at]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[regional and global
levels]{.underline}]{.mark}. The contributions of this research extend
to the field of environmental economics and policy-making by providing
empirical insights into the specific dynamics shaping CEM in the Arctic.
Utilizing the STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population,
affluence, and technology) model and the Driscoll and Kraay standard
errors (DSK), fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), and moments
quantile regression (MMQR) econometric approaches allow for a robust
analysis of the relationships between the essential variables. The
[[findings can **inform policy-makers** within the Arctic Council about
the efficacy of current EVG structures and guide them in implementing
targeted strategies to **curb CEMs** while fostering **sustainable**
development]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region. Furthermore, the study
adds to the body of knowledge on environmentally sound development in
academia by providing insightful analysis to academics, researchers, and
policy-makers who must balance safeguarding the environment and economic
expansion in fragile ecosystems.

2.2. EVT and CEM. [[The dynamic between EVT and CEM is inherently
collaborative]{.underline}]{.mark}, where adopting advanced EVT is
essential for enhancing environmental quality. [[These technologies aim
to reduce]{.underline}]{.mark} pollution and [[emissions, conserve
natural resources, and protect biodiversity]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Research across various studies reflects this connection. Thus, Cheng et
al. \[32\] analyzed data from 35 OECD countries using panel quantile
regression (QR). They discovered that technological innovation not only
significantly decreases CEM. Contrastingly, a study by Rahman et al.
\[33\] investigated the impact of EVT on CEM in 22 countries. Their
findings indicated that negative shocks in EVT increase CEM in the long
term. These studies highlight the complex and unexpected relationships
between EVT and environmental quality. Employing the MMQR method, Ali et
al. \[34\] explored the effect of EVT on CEM within the G20 nations.
Their findings demonstrate that [[EVT strengthens ecological
health]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, Sampene et al. \[5\] looked at
the impact of EVT on pollution levels in the BRICS economies, using data
from 1990 to 2020. A cross-section augmented autoregressive distributive
lag model was used to examine both long-term and short term dynamics.
The findings revealed that both [[improved institutional quality
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the use of [[EVT contribute to reducing
environmental impact]{.underline}]{.mark}, implying that they play an
important role in [[mitigating environmental
degradation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### RE reduces CEM

transition (RET) environmental governance (EVG) Rapid urbanization

2.3. RET and CEM. [[The world's]{.underline}]{.mark} expanding
population and subsequent increase in energy demands mean that
continuous [[reliance on fossil fuels creates significant environmental
damage. In contrast, renewable energy is abundant, environmentally
friendly, and less vulnerable to geopolitical
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} \[35\]. [[Research demonstrates that RET
reduces CEM and promotes sustainable development and environmental
quality]{.underline}]{.mark} \[4, 36, 37\]. Anwar et al. \[38\] revealed
that increasing the use of renewables reduces CEM in Japan and
ecological footprints in Turkey. However, carbon-intensive energy
sources such as coal have been related to increased CO2 emissions in
South Africa, lowering environmental quality \[39\]. Moreover, Chen et
al. \[40\] reported that RET positively influenced reducing CEM in 120
nations. According to Wang et al. \[41\], employing the panel QR
approach in 192 nations, renewable energy plays an important role in
regulating CEM. Sun et al. \[42\] investigated the effects of
environmental technologies, RET, urbanization, and economic growth on
the environmental footprints of 17 Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies from 1990 to 2019. The study investigation used the
STIRPAT model and found that technological development and RET promote
air quality. [[Adebayo]{.underline}]{.mark} et al. \[43\] used the
quantile-on-quantile approach to study CEM in Sweden. They [[discovered
that RET reduces CEM across most quantiles]{.underline}]{.mark}.

One study has analysed the costs of a potential hybridisation of the
power sector in Qaanaaq, a settlement of less than a thousand people in
north-western Greenland \[47\]. Several scenarios with a solar-diesel
system, solar-battery-diesel system, and solar-battery-hydrogen-diesel
system were analysed. [[Solar PV and battery incorporation into a fully
diesel]{.underline}]{.mark} generator-[[based]{.underline}]{.mark} power
supply [[system were shown to offer savings and increase
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} in case of oil price changes \[47\]. De
Witt et al. \[50\] have applied a system dynamics model to investigate
energy transition pathways for remote Arctic communities that
predominantly rely on diesel for electricity generation. Integration of
RE sources were found to lead to reduced electricity costs in the future
across all scenarios compared to a business-as-usual scenario.
[[However, an initial increase in electricity
prices]{.mark}]{.underline} can be observed across all scenarios.
Introduction of a CO2 tax, **[[subsidies]{.mark}]{.underline}** to
investments in renewables, [[and **direct loans** from the
**government**]{.underline}]{.mark} under special conditions [[can aid a
**fast transition** to renewables]{.underline}]{.mark} and achieve lower
costs \[50\]. The feasibility of renewables integration in Longyearbyen
in Svalbard, in Maniitsoq in Greenland, and in Kotzebue in Alaska has
been investigated in another study by the authors \[51\]. Nine different
scenarios with various solar PV, wind power, and hydropower penetration
have been analysed and compared to the base case scenario based
primarily on diesel. [[A transition to RE sources is found to be
significantly lower in cost over the long term]{.underline}]{.mark} for
all three locations, [[despite significant upfront investment
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}. High hydropower penetration is found to
offer the highest cost reductions in Longyearbyen and Maniitsoq, whereas
in Kotzebue high or medium wind penetration in the energy system is more
beneficial. High investment costs may pose a problem for these
communities and establishing governmental support is crucial for the
transition \[51\].

The feasibility of increased uptake of renewables in Longyearbyen has
been also investigated by Ringkjøb et al. \[49\]. Wind power and solar
PV have been shown to have beneficial complementary properties when used
together and have the potential [[to meet the electricity demand of the
local energy system]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, an off-grid system
has been found to require 7 times higher total installed electricity
generation capacity than the current system, whereas in other scenarios
with imports of fossil fuels or hydrogen, the installed capacities are
at the same level as today. Furthermore, the off-grid system has
multiple times higher annual costs compared to a scenario where hydrogen
can be imported \[49\]. Similarly, a study of the power sector of
Grimsey Island in Iceland found that integration of wind power can
reduce the annualised costs over 20 years \[48\]. The study advises a
system based on wind-hydrogen-diesel for current implementation, [[with
gradual diesel phase-out in the future]{.underline}]{.mark} \[48\]. A
comprehensive review on 100% RE systems for islands \[37\] and a review
for 100% RE systems did not detect any study for Greenland on village,
island, or country level \[36\]. However, [[a study on wind and wave
power]{.underline}]{.mark} potential on 22 islands has [[found Greenland
to be one of the best sites]{.underline}]{.mark} for offshore wind power
with 4555--5450 full load hours (FLH) in addition to good conditions for
wave power with 1050--4000 FLH \[54\]. Satymov et al. \[55\] found
5000--6000 FLH in the south of Greenland for an improved wave energy
converter.

The objectives of studying energy generation in communities in Northwest

renewable integration strategies on the grid or consumer scales via
energy system modeling and economic analysis, and 2.) Identify the

1.) was addressed via grid-scale MILP energy modeling with utility and
community-based operation perspectives and net-metering analysis.
Objective 2.) was met via collaborating with Nukissiorfiit and

3.7 Conclusions

The major findings of this research are that
[[renewable]{.underline}]{.mark} energy in the form of [[solar PV and
battery storage]{.underline}]{.mark} [[are
cost-effective]{.underline}]{.mark} strategies [[for reducing
diesel]{.underline}]{.mark}-based [[generation]{.underline}]{.mark}
costs in small, non-hydro communities. This carries significant weight
for Nukissiorfiit's energy planning strategy, which has focused on
large-scale hydropower for southern localities and kept energy planning
and goals for northern communities vague. This research identifies
several cost-optimal projects that can be used [[for
planning]{.underline}]{.mark} for the future [[under a variety of
economic conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Large solar installations of over a 1-MW can maximize generation cost
reduction in a number of scenarios. However, most realistically, under
the current (2023) economic conditions (high solar price, high BES, and
4% discount rate), 600-kW of solar with a small battery (50 kWh)
minimize generation costs, reducing the LCOE from DKk 5/kWh to DKK
4.32/kWh. While this does not get reduced past the electric sale rate of
DKK 1.75/kWh, this saves Nukissiorfiit DKK 0.68 for every kilowatt hour
generated in Qaanaaq. If renewable capacity can be purchased at [[lower
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}, the LCOE of renewable assets alone is
reduced [[past the electric sale rate]{.underline}]{.mark} and thus
[[could be considered for]{.underline}]{.mark} a variety of
community-based generation arrangements such as [[an
IPP]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**[[Net metering]{.underline}]{.mark}** can be a cost-effective solution
for reducing overall electric costs through abating
Nukissiorfiit-supplied electricity, thus saving participants money on
electric bills and earning them a profit on abated fuel. This fuel
abatement profit [[is a driver]{.underline}]{.mark} of low payback
periods. Maximizing profits via excess energy is less cost-effective
than maximizing profits by [[abating diesel]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
analysis assumes that Nukissiorfiit is only paying for the abated fuel
that would have met the consumer's demand directly (and thus, the excess
generation is not included because Nukissiorfiit already incentivizes
the transfer of excess electricity). A 2-3-kW system results in savings
that meet or exceed total annual electricity costs. This clearly still
requires consumers to pay for electricity in winter months when no solar
energy is available but indicates that during summer months, the profits
and electric savings can re-coup wintertime losses. The optimal size of
a solar installation for a residence is dependent on a number of factors
but is most likely limited by the upfront capital costs of the panels.
Therefore, since payback periods are relatively similar and additional
profits from diesel abatement are minimal beyond 2 kW of solar, it may
be recommended that homeowners start with a 2-kW solar installation.

Nukissiorfiit's current estimate on the cost of bifacials may result in
monofacial panels being more cost-effective as an initial investment,
depending on the projected site characteristics in Qaanaaq. However, as
costs decrease, it may become advantageous to include bifacial panels in
different orientations, including vertical east-west-facing panels and
tilted south-facing panels. If summertime bifacial gains can be expected
to be 20% or more continuously, bifacial panels may result in lower
LCOEs relative to monofacial panels when solar capital is modest or low.

[[Diesel]{.underline}]{.mark} generation [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}
likely [[always be necessary to some degree]{.underline}]{.mark} for
Northern communities, as a primary winter generation source, or as an
ancillary service. For complete energy and fuel independence, [[a
balance of renewable]{.underline}]{.mark} generation sources would be
needed including [[wind, solar, GFM, and]{.underline}]{.mark} a variety
of [[storage]{.underline}]{.mark} sources for different storage
timelines. More battery capacities [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} be
necessary to [[achieve diesel-off modes long-term]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Without dispatchable baseloads, charging during off-peak hours will
depend on resources available (solar or wind). Fine resolution demand
data would help predict when batteries are needed in the dispatch order.
Daytime demands may be lower than evening demands, making it possible to
charge batteries during the daytime using solar or wind, and dispatch
batteries as a primary generator during evenings and mornings.

Overall, this research concludes that [[it can be cost-optimal to
incorporate renewable]{.underline}]{.mark} energy into small, non-hydro
grids in Greenland. [[However, many policy tools are
needed]{.underline}]{.mark} to ensure that future renewable energy
projects mutually benefit the community and utility and that the
projects center community priorities. [[Financial]{.underline}]{.mark}
tools for helping communities [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} residents
overcome high initial costs will significantly reduce barriers to
community energy projects. [[Community planning]{.underline}]{.mark}
tools that prioritize technical and managerial capacity building in
communities [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that energy system planning on the
[[community scale]{.underline}]{.mark} is done in a way that
[[centers]{.underline}]{.mark} the community goals, skill-building, and
finances and can ensure [[reliable and continuous
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} supply in a changing energy system.

Based on the discussion above, it matters the most to grasp and explore
the driving factors of CEM and sustainability issues in the Arctic
region. [[Economic policy uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}
([EPU]{.underline}) [[has been discussed by prior studies as one of the
drivers that cause an **upsurge in CEM**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[7, 8\].
EPU pertains to public policies, specifically monetary, and fiscal
initiatives, influencing business and enterprise activities and economic
operations. **[[Mitigating]{.underline}]{.mark}** and understanding
[[**EPU** is important for fostering a stable and conducive environment
for **sustainable economic development**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
business landscape and environment are mostly influenced by EPU, which
eventually impacts businesses' actions and decisions. EPU may also
influence the ecological system and affect economic progress. For
example, Ali et al. \[9\] asserted that EPU will stimulate manufacturers
and businesses to adopt ecologically unfriendly production approaches,
resulting in higher CEM.

[[influences]{.underline}]{.mark} the country or region's [[adoption of
CEM reduction technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}. The association between
EPU and CEM has been the subject of limited research. Pirgaip and
Dinçergök \[27\] looked at the connection between EPU and CEM in the G7
region. Jiang and Ma \[28\] focused [[on the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}, employing sector specific data to discover
the effect of institutional factors on the EPU and CEM; [[the study
discovered a favorable connection]{.underline}]{.mark} between EPU and
CEM growth. Further, Alvarado et al. \[29\] assessed the impact of EPU
on CEM within selected MENA regions using an augmented STIRPAT model
covering data from 1970 to 2020. Their [[results indicated that the EPU
exacerbates environmental degradation]{.underline}]{.mark}, with
significant effects observed amid considerable changes in Morocco,
Turkey, and Iran. In addition, Hussain, Arshad, and Bashir \[30\]
investigated how EPU affects environmental quality, using advanced
econometric techniques to account for unit roots and cointegration. They
found that EPU contributes positively to CEM. In their study, Assamoi
and Wang \[31\] analyzed how EPU and environmental policy stringency
jointly affect CEM, applying an asymmetric (nonlinear) approach. The
[[results show]{.underline}]{.mark} that an [[increase in EPU causes an
uprise in CEM]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Accordingly, this study focused on the Arctic Council, comprised of
Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Canada, Norway, the United States, and Iceland.
[[The Arctic nations]{.underline}]{.mark}, known for their vulnerability
to climate alteration, [[have become a focal point for global ecological
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rapid urbanization transition (URT)
driven by economic expansion raises questions about how this
transformation affects environmental sustainability in this region.
Morgunova and Westphal \[6\] asserted that [[the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} nation [[is grappling with divergent
regulatory frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and economic interests,
resulting in uncertainty in resource]{.underline}]{.mark} exploitation
[[and investment decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, the
ambiguity surrounding exploiting gas and oil reserves among the Arctic
nations has resulted in a lack of clear standards and guidelines for
extracting these minerals. [[This uncertainty has led to
hesitancy]{.underline}]{.mark} among enterprises, investors, and [[firms
in committing to long-term projects]{.underline}]{.mark} and
initiatives, [[impeding]{.underline}]{.mark} economic progress and
reducing environmental quality. Moreover, the lack of regulations
governing the creation of [[renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark} and
carbon reduction initiatives has impeded the transition to more
environmentally friendly energy sources. [[Member
nations]{.underline}]{.mark} might [[emphasize instantaneous fiscal
benefit above]{.underline}]{.mark} prospective
[[sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark} goals [[without a common
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fossil fuel extraction, for instance,
would become more important in some nations due to growing economic
instability, increasing CEMs, and worsening global warming. [[The Arctic
Council has to collaborate to]{.underline}]{.mark} create clear and
consistent economic policies and [[prioritize sustainable
practices]{.underline}]{.mark} and carbon reduction [[to lessen the
detrimental impact]{.underline}]{.mark} of economic activity [[on the

In the rapidly unpredictable economic and environmental era, the Arctic
region stands at a pivotal crossroads. Globally, the rise in [[carbon
emission (CEM) has continued to escalate]{.underline}]{.mark} in recent
decades. Still, extant analyses have not sufficiently investigated the
variables contributing to CEM dissipation, [[particularly in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} Council. Therefore, this paper closes the
knowledge gap by [[assessing the influence of]{.underline}]{.mark}
environmental technology (EVT), [[economic policy
uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark} ([EPU]{.underline}), renewable energy
transition, and urban transition on CEM. Moreover, the study
investigated [[the moderation effect of environmental governance on the
interconnection between EPU and CEMs]{.underline}]{.mark}, incorporating
historical data from 30 years ago (1990--2020). The research applied
three econometric techniques, moments quantile regression, fully
modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), and Driscoll and Kray standard
errors (DSK), to ascertain the interaction among the research
indicators. The study's outcome [[established]{.underline}]{.mark} that
(1) the switch to renewable or cleaner power supply,
[[EVT]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and governance improves ecological
health]{.underline}]{.mark}. (2) [[Environmental policy uncertainty and
urban transition disrupt ecological stability in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} region. (3) [[Environmental government

Additionally, the COP26 agreement encourages attempts to restrict
raising the temperature to 1.5°C, considering the severe consequences
that even a modest temperature rise can have on vulnerable ecosystems
and communities. [[Aligning with the sustainable development
goals]{.underline}]{.mark} (SDGs 6, 7, 11, and 13), [[addressing CEM
problems is integral to achieving targets]{.underline}]{.mark} connected
to sanitation and water, clean energy and clean power supply,
sustainable communities and cities, and climate action. Hence,
[[addressing CEM challenges and problems is crucial for attaining the
interconnectedness between these SDGs and fostering a more resilient and
healthier globe]{.underline}]{.mark}. Sampene et al. \[5\] asserted that
[[a sustainable solution]{.underline}]{.mark} and Initiatives [[from
various stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark} and researchers [[could
significantly reduce CEM]{.underline}]{.mark}. Therefore, [[assessing
the drivers of CEM emission in the Arctic region is
essential]{.underline}]{.mark}.

TOs indicating to regime decline were not very visibly discussed in
either of the country\'s strategies, and only in passing in Finland.
This provides a question of scales in transitions in these two
countries. On the one hand, Norway is an oil producing country, but it
mainly exports oil and gas and aims for carbon neutrality domestically.
Finland, on the other hand, imports all of its fossil fuels, and despite
grand plans, decarbonising the society is not granted in planned time.
Therefore, [[regime decline would occur on an international scale in
Norway if it were to cease fossil fuel extraction]{.underline}]{.mark},
on a national scale in Finland if it were to implement a genuinely
effective decarbonisation policy, [[and regionally in the Arctic if the
necessary materials, minerals, and technologies were sustainably and
ethically sourced from northern areas]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal
11]{.underline}]{.mark} (SDG 11) also [[recognizes the need for safe,
affordable, and inclusive human settlements]{.underline}]{.mark}. SDG 11
states, \"By 2030, en33 sure access for all to adequate, safe, and
affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums\" \[124\]. With
clear goals for the future of housing for the region, [[appropriate
designs should]{.underline}]{.mark} be made to
[[address]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[specific
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} and housing goals.

Regional Residential Energy Demands

[[Energy plays a **crucial** role]{.underline}]{.mark} in the ongoing
affordability and maintenance of housing. Energy and fuel costs are
standardized across Greenland despite a greater dependence on fossil
fuel-based heating and electricity generation in the much colder
northern regions. 12 With considerably higher energy demands than
southern localities, residents in the north are subject to higher energy
cost burdens. All homes in northern communities depend on fossil fuels
for 100% of their heat and electricity generation. Oil fired boilers and
small diesel drip heaters are the standard heating appliances. As an
Arctic nation, all homes in Greenland require heating for much of the
year, but home heating is needed year-round in northern Greenland. For
example, [[Qaanaaq has]{.underline}]{.mark} approximately 9,800
[[Heating]{.underline}]{.mark} Degree Days for an 18-degree Centigrade
base temperature; this [[is a 44% increase]{.underline}]{.mark} from the
more southerly capital of Nuuk, with 6,780 heating degree days \[125\].

In 2011, the average heat consumption for all Greenlandic houses was
reported as 416 kWh/m2 -annual, and the average heat consumption for a
specific type-house model above the Arctic circle was 317 kWh/m2 -annual
\[93\]. This can be compared to the average heat consumption of the
Norwegian and Canadian north, at 181 and 231 kWh/m2 -annual,
respectively \[93\], \[126\]. This difference highlights the need and
opportunity for increasing the energy efficiency of the Greenlandic
housing stock. Our energy audit measurements and analysis of several
single-family, year-round occupied homes in Qaanaaq are presented in
Chapter 4.8.1, and reveal high energy demands resulting from excessive
air infiltration and inadequate insulation for the Arctic climate.
[[Overturning the housing stock]{.underline}]{.mark} with energy
efficient homes [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} significantly
[[impact]{.underline}]{.mark} ongoing [[energy
costs]{.underline}]{.mark} for residents [[and
reduce]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[volatility]{.underline}]{.mark} to
changes in fuel prices.

#### Arctic RE mining promotes all 17 SDG's

(ermo-MSDI, acc 6-23-2025)

[[Although mining has]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[potential]{.underline}]{.mark} to have [[negative effects on the local
environment and people, it can also bring positive effects and
opportunities, such as infrastructure and jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}, to
these remote regions; [[development]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[is
often]{.underline}]{.mark} looked on favourably, and even in some cases
[[invited by local communities]{.underline}]{.mark} (Langston, 2021).
[[Mining is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore inexorably [[linked to
sustainable development, touching on all 17 of the UN's sustainable
development goals]{.underline}]{.mark} (Monteiro et al., 2019). Arctic
peoples have traditionally protected the environment, maintaining and
enhancing the environment for future generations (Ahtuangaruak, 2018).
Socioenvironmental conflicts, primarily involving extractive industries
and infrastructure development, often overlap with Indigenous peoples'
territories (Hanaček et al., 2022). Arctic residents are therefore
seeking to have a bigger say when it comes to Arctic decision-making,
incorporating the rich knowledge of local environments and a long
history of interaction with mining and industrial development.

### Solvency \-- Plan goes Global -- Hydrogen Storage

#### Storage is critical -- enables hydrogen transition

Storage Technologies: [[Energy storage]{.underline}]{.mark} systems
(ESS) [[are critical for]{.underline}]{.mark} maintaining [[reliability
in remote grids with renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark} resources.
Short-term energy storage via Li-ion batteries or flywheels is very
important for [[balancing]{.underline}]{.mark} stochastic,
non-dispatchable resources like [[solar PV and
wind]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Short-Term: [[Li-ion batteries]{.underline}]{.mark} are extremely
popular sources of short-term energy storage and [[are
common]{.underline}]{.mark}ly implemented [[in Arctic
microgrids]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Kotzebue, Alaska, the wind and solar
PV installation is complemented by a one megawatt-hour Li-ion (lithium
ferrous phosphate LFP) battery. Before this battery was installed, the
utility installed a zincbromide flow battery, which failed in the local
conditions \[33\]. The extreme cold weather was thought to affect the
hose clamp seals, causing leaks \[52\]. Shungnak and Kobuk Alaska use
LFP batteries in their remote microgrid. LFP batteries are lower in
density, and the degradation is more sensitive to temperature, but they
last longer than lithium-ion chemistries with cobalt and are less toxic
because they do not contain cobalt \[53\];\[54\]. Li-ion batteries are
sensitive to the cold, so in both Kotzebue and Shungnak/Kobuk, extra
care is taken to ensure Li-ion batteries are kept in a heated enclosure.
Kodiak, Alaska, uses [[both flywheel and battery energy
storage]{.underline}]{.mark} with wind-hydro hybrid generation \[33\].
The flywheels both store short-term energy and inject or absorb real and
reactive power to the grid, [[stabiliz]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[voltage
and frequency]{.underline}]{.mark} \[55\].

Long-Term: Arctic communities that experience polar day and night could
benefit from seasonal or long-duration energy storage technologies that
can help balance the mismatch in demand for electricity with available
solar power. Several medium-to-long-duration energy storage technologies
exist, including pumped hydroelectric storage, flow batteries, and
hydrogen storage. [[A diverse Arctic grid could utilize
both]{.underline}]{.mark} lithium-ion battery energy storage or
flywheels for short-term balancing and a long-duration energy storage
source for seasonal balancing \[56\].

Redox flow batteries (RFB) have a high potential for long-duration (\>
6-hour) energy storage, do not tend to self-discharge, and provide large
numbers of charge-discharge cycles down to complete discharge. Of the
existing RFBs, all-vanadium batteries are the most commercially mature
\[57\]. All vanadium RFBs are aqueous systems that are sensitive to cold
climates because of water's high freezing point. Therefore, the
commercially available RBFs may show instability at low temperatures
\[58\]. Therefore, for application in Arctic energy systems, there must
be commercially available RFBs with new electrolyte designs that widen
the temperature range.

[[Hydrogen]{.underline}]{.mark} storage is a chemical energy storage
option that [[can store **vast**]{.underline}]{.mark} amounts of
[[energy]{.underline}]{.mark}, making it an attractive option [[for
long-duration]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hydrogen has a high energy content
per unit mass (120 MJ/kg H2) [[but low volumetric]{.underline}]{.mark}
energy [[density at normal temperature]{.underline}]{.mark} and pressure
(0.0824 kg/m3) \[59\]. This [[is the largest
barrier]{.underline}]{.mark} to cost-effective seasonal hydro18 gen
storage in a stationary application. Hydrogen can be compressed,
liquefied, or bound chemically in order to increase storage density.
Compressed hydrogen is a commercially mature method but still requires
high storage volumes and requires energy for compression (13-18% of the
lower heating value of hydrogen \[59\]). Hydrogen has a lower round-trip
efficiency than batteries due to energy conversion losses in the fuel
cell and electrolyzer, making hydrogen less favorable for short cycle
times \[60\], \[61\]. Solid state materials, such as metal hydrides, for
hydrogen storage, are a promising option but are neither widely
available nor currently cost-effective \[62\]. Hydrogen can also be
stored underground for greater volumes.

[[Hydrogen]{.underline}]{.mark}, or long-duration energy storage in
general, [[could encourage green electrified
heating]{.underline}]{.mark} by supporting greater renewable capacity
additions. In 2018, the Nukissiorfiit explored hydrogen feasibility in
Ilulissat, Greenland, where there is a significant overproduction of
hydropower energy and interest in electrified heating \[63\]. The high
cost of the electrolysis process, coupled with the existing energy
storage system associated with the hydropower plant, made hydrogen
storage economically unfavorable and unnecessary for energy balancing.
The analysis concludes that in Ilulissat, it would be more economically
advantageous to use the surplus energy generation for the
electrification of heat via air-air or water-air heat pumps.
Electrolysers are projected to decrease in costs and increase in
efficiency \[64\]. Therefore, [[exploring hydrogen in a Greenlandic
context as a **long-term**]{.underline}]{.mark} energy resiliency
[[strategy could prove to be economically feasible]{.underline}]{.mark}
for communities without existing hydropower or storage/balancing
capacity, in the future.

The [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} faces major

transition]{.underline}]{.mark}, with global energy flows made
exceptionally visible when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, [[is also an
on-going process in the Arctic. The area has broad importance to the

resources \[1\]. Yet, energy transition in the Arctic has received scant
attention in the transitions literature \[2\]. Previous research has
shown that the [[oil and gas]{.underline}]{.mark} industry [[has a

[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} long-term development and expansion since
[[the 1970s]{.underline}]{.mark} oil crises, despite serious climate

Policy frameworks must be strengthened in order for Arctic climate

Treaty could impose limitations on]{.underline}]{.mark} emissions and
[[resource extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}, while [[strengthening the
Polar Code will ensure more stringent management]{.underline}]{.mark} of
shipping emissions and pollution. Arctic-specific [[climate funds can
help fund renewable energy, conservation, and community
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} initiatives, but methods for
compensating Indigenous communities for climate-related losses must be
established. Regional and global [[collaborations]{.underline}]{.mark},
such as those [[organised by the Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} help to [[coordinate action and
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} sharing. Technological advancements
provide chances to strengthen Arctic resilience. Climate-resilient
infrastructure, such as floating structures and adaptable pipelines, can
resist severe weather and permafrost melt. Decentralised renewable
energy systems and innovative battery storage technologies can provide
stable electricity in remote Arctic locations, while IoT-based
monitoring systems track vulnerabilities in real time, allowing for
quick responses to emerging problems. [[Restoring Arctic habitats is
important for minimising climate impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}. Wildlife
corridors can help species migrate, and rewilding degraded landscapes
with native vegetation increases biodiversity and carbon sequestration.
Developing resilient agricultural practices, such as cold-resistant
crops and agroforestry, can promote food security while decreasing
reliance on imported foods.

[[Education and awareness about Arctic climate challenges is critical.
Global campaigns emphasising the Arctic's role]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the climate system, combined with contemporary techniques, such as
multimedia and virtual reality, [[can reach a larger audience. Citizen

technologies towards green energy are constantly being tested and
trialled]{.underline}]{.mark}, often [[financed with oil and gas
revenues]{.underline}]{.mark}. This happens while enabling the local
living conditions. [[In the Arctic, this means that areas populated is
one way to put security into everyday practice]{.underline}]{.mark}:
earning a living, childcare and learning one\'s own language are a few
examples discussed in the interviews. [[Demographic development connects

Summary

[[Alaska's experience with wind energy demonstrates that small,
remote]{.underline}]{.mark}, and often overlooked [[markets can serve as
**incubators** for innovations]{.underline}]{.mark} that later become
mainstream. [[The unique challenges of operating in extreme environments
have driven]{.underline}]{.mark} the development of [[cutting-edge
microgrid solutions]{.underline}]{.mark} that are now informing
resilience strategies worldwide. As microgrids gain prominence in both
national and international energy planning, [[Alaska
offers]{.underline}]{.mark} a wealth of [[lessons
from]{.underline}]{.mark} decades of [[operating in islanded grid
mode]{.underline}]{.mark}.

One of the most significant takeaways from Alaska's wind energy
transition is that [[necessity drives innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Without access to a larger grid, Alaska utilities and communities had to
pioneer strategies [[for integrating wind into
microgrids]{.underline}]{.mark}, balancing intermittent renewables with
energy storage, and maintaining reliable power in some of the harshest
conditions on Earth. [[These lessons are increasingly relevant beyond
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[microgrids
play]{.underline}]{.mark} a growing [[role in]{.underline}]{.mark}
enhancing [[energy resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} in
[[islanded]{.underline}]{.mark} regions,
[[disaster-prone]{.underline}]{.mark} areas, [[and remote industrial
sites]{.underline}]{.mark}.

As Alaska's early wind projects approach the end of their design life,
the state faces new challenges related to system renewal, financing, and
long-term sustainability. However, the same
[[pioneering]{.underline}]{.mark} spirit that enabled wind energy to
take hold in the first place, [[along with new financing models and
policy adaptations]{.underline}]{.mark}, will [[ensure that wind energy
remains a cornerstone of rural energy resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The lessons learned in Alaska are more relevant than ever, offering a
roadmap [[for off-grid renewable transitions
**worldwide**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Holdmann et al. \[59\] have investigated the driving factors of energy
transition to renewables in different small diesel-dependant Arctic
communities to investigate why some communities successfully develop RE
projects while others lag behind. The analysis of 24 remote locations in
Alaska has found that the [[lack of subsidies for
diesel]{.underline}]{.mark} power generation [[is one of the most
important conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} for developing renewable
projects, [[followed by]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} of communities to manage projects
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} availability of [[community pooled
resources]{.underline}]{.mark} \[59\]. Furthermore, RE projects get
implemented faster in larger and more populous communities to benefit
more people, whereas [[smaller and more isolated communities may be left
out despite having greater need]{.underline}]{.mark} for alternative
energy sources due to more vulnerable energy systems \[60\].

[[The Norwegian]{.underline}]{.mark} interview [[data provided a more
detailed outlook]{.underline}]{.mark} to the strategies. The
interviewees discussed [[several]{.underline}]{.mark} different [[types
of renewable]{.underline}]{.mark} energy that [[are already in use or
can be increased (hydro, wind, solar, bioenergy) and technologies that
have potential for the region]{.underline}]{.mark} (hydrogen, nuclear,
fusion, osmosis, carbon capture and storage).
[[Several]{.underline}]{.mark} of these [[were noted for the **potential
scaling of renewable energy** production in the north **to export** to
European markets]{.underline}]{.mark}. This expansion was explicitly
discussed in connection to the war in Ukraine, and it was also mentioned
that the extensive electricity transmission and distribution networks
could become targets in wartime, indicating a negative security approach
where states provide security to critical infrastructure.

The [[energy exports from the Norwegian Arctic to the European market
were regarded as hindering the energy transition in the short term,
because the exported energy is mainly oil and gas]{.mark}]{.underline} -
the exports of which to the EU have increased after 2022, Norway being
perceived as a reliable producer. [[However, the scaling up of renewable
energy and its exports to the EU would advance the energy transition,
once renewable energy production reaches a sufficient level of
maturity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Others saw no connection with security
nor sovereignty in these transition processes. It was seen that
[[extending electricity transmission networks]{.underline}]{.mark},
constructed to transmit renewable electricity elsewhere, [[would
decrease the overall cost of electricity]{.underline}]{.mark} and bring
industrial development and economic wellbeing to the Arctic. The latter
perspective is linked to positive security thinking, in which locals
would have more agency in planning and operations through regional
political bodies. This includes the reindeer herders, who struggle with
electricity network expansion and wind farms, because they decrease
reindeer grazing lands even as the herders grasp the need to improve
critical infrastructure. Indeed, "in a European context, [[North Norway
has vast wind energy potential]{.underline}]{.mark}" (\[69\], p.63), as
indicated also in the strategy work and needs broader attention for
inclusive decision-making.

#### Arctic climate change overwhelms other regions

The [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} climate is shaped by three major
[[drivers]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[accelerate warming **more rapidly
than in other regions**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[greenhouse gases]{.underline}]{.mark},
such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), trap heat in the
atmosphere, raising surface temperatures \[109,110,111\]. [[Second,
albedo]{.underline}]{.mark} changes due to
[[melting]{.underline}]{.mark} snow and sea ice [[expose darker land and
ocean surfaces, which absorb]{.underline}]{.mark} more solar radiation.
This reduction in reflectivity intensifies warming in a self-reinforcing
cycle \[44,112\]. [[Third, polar vortex]{.underline}]{.mark} dynamics
are increasingly disrupted by Arctic warming. As the temperature
gradient between the Arctic and mid-latitudes narrows, the polar vortex
weakens and [[becomes more erratic]{.underline}]{.mark}, allowing cold
Arctic air to move southward and allowing warmer air to enter the Arctic
\[113,114,115\]. [[Together, these]{.underline}]{.mark} climate drivers
[[contribute to]{.underline}]{.mark} the unique and [[amplified
warming]{.underline}]{.mark} pattern observed across the Arctic region.

#### Arctic amplification causes global positive feedback acceleration

In recent decades, the Arctic has experienced significant increases in
temperature as a result of both rising greenhouse gas emissions and
[[the Arctic's unique feedback mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark} \[4\].
[[Historically]{.underline}]{.mark}, the vast ice and snow cover in the
Arctic has [[work]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[as a mirror, reflecting
most]{.underline}]{.mark} of the sun's [[energy into
space]{.underline}]{.mark} \[76,77,78\]. However,
[[when]{.underline}]{.mark} temperatures rise, this reflecting layer is
gradually [[replaced by darker ocean water and exposed
land]{.underline}]{.mark}, both of which [[absorb significantly more
solar energy]{.underline}]{.mark} \[79\]. This absorption accelerates
warming, resulting in additional ice and snow loss---a cycle that
continues to increase. Beyond surface changes, air dynamics have an
important impact on Arctic temperature trends \[80\]. Global
warming-induced [[shifts in the polar vortex and jet
stream]{.underline}]{.mark} are sending [[warmer
air]{.underline}]{.mark} masses northward,
[[result]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} peculiar
patterns of seasonal variability and [[extreme
occurrences]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region \[81\]. Ocean currents
also contribute to this warming: the input of warmer Atlantic waters
interrupts the normal cooling processes in Arctic, causing faster sea
ice melt and increasing the thermal instability \[82\]. Surface feedback
mechanisms, atmospheric changes, and ocean currents all work together to
form an Arctic climate system that is extremely sensitive to change
\[80\]. [[The effects are not isolated; warming in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} influences weather patterns across the
Northern Hemisphere, [[drives]{.underline}]{.mark} sea-level rises, and
increases the [[risks to biodiversity and coastal ecosystems
worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark} \[1\]. Understanding these trends and
drivers is important, as they reveal not only the vulnerabilities of the
Arctic but also the broader impacts of a rapidly changing climate.

Recent studies show that the Arctic is [[warming at considerably higher
rates than the world average]{.underline}]{.mark}---a phenomenon [[known
as Arctic amplification]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which it warms at
nearly four times the global average \[9\]. This warming trend is
significantly caused by specific regional feedback processes and
atmospheric--oceanic interactions \[83\]. Historical data suggest that
Arctic temperatures have risen by about 2.3 °C since the early twentieth
century, greatly exceeding world norms \[84\]. Observations from 1979 to
2021 show that a significant portion of the Arctic Ocean warmed at a
rate [[exceeding 0.75 °C per decade]{.underline}]{.mark} \[9\].
Ground-based records, particularly from coastal and island stations,
indicate that this trend accelerated significantly during the 1970s,
coinciding with substantial increases in industrial emissions \[85\].
Arctic amplification is caused by a complex combination of local
feedback, including sea ice--albedo effects, increased heat and moisture
transport from lower latitudes, and increased cloud cover \[86,87\].

The "tropically excited Arctic warming mechanism"
([[TEAM]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[is an important driver of Arctic
amplification]{.underline}]{.mark}, connecting increased tropical
convection with Arctic warming. TEAM suggests that enhanced convection
in the Pacific warm pool boosts poleward Rossby wave propagation,
thereby transferring heat and moisture to the Arctic \[88,89\]. This
transport not only enhances downwelling longwave radiation (DLW), but it
also contributes to rising Arctic temperatures \[88,90,91\]. Atmospheric
latent heat (LH) transfer has been demonstrated to be more efficient in
warming the Arctic compared to dry static energy (DSE) transit \[92\].
This effect is amplified by [[the "water vapour triple
effect,"]{.underline}]{.mark} in which moisture
[[boosts]{.underline}]{.mark} the greenhouse effect before condensing,
resulting in [[additional warming]{.underline}]{.mark} via increased
cloudiness \[93,94,95\]. The role of maritime heat movement is another
important consideration. Observations indicate that oceanic heat inflow
through the Fram Strait and Barents Sea has increased, transporting warm
Atlantic waters into the Arctic \[96\]. This heat contributes directly
to sea ice melt and local warming, allowing for longer periods of open
water and diminishing sea ice extent \[97,98\]. Climate models also
support this trend, indicating that under continued warming scenarios,
ocean heat transport into the Arctic will continue to be a major driver
of Arctic amplification, contributing significantly to long-term sea ice
decline and temperature increases \[99,100,101\].

#### Arctic warming goes global -- albedo and circulation feedback loops

6-23-2025)

The [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} is vulnerable to a variety of
[[feedback mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[accelerate
warming]{.underline}]{.mark} and alter climate dynamics \[4\].
[[Ice--**albedo**]{.underline}]{.mark} feedback, which occurs when the
ice cover shrinks, [[exposes darker ocean or land
surfaces]{.underline}]{.mark} \[10\]. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
exposed surface [[absorbs more solar energy than
ice]{.underline}]{.mark}, which reflects sunlight, [[resulting
in]{.underline}]{.mark} increased heat and [[accelerated ice
melting]{.underline}]{.mark}. This cycle of melting ice and increased
heat absorption is an important driver of Arctic warming \[133\]. The
release of greenhouse gases from permafrost thawing is an important
feedback mechanism \[134\]. [[As permafrost thaws, the organic
material]{.underline}]{.mark} trapped [[beneath it **decomposes**,
emitting]{.underline}]{.mark} carbon dioxide and
[[methane]{.underline}]{.mark}, both of [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} are
important greenhouse gases \[18\]. These emissions add to atmospheric
warming, which increases permafrost thaw, resulting in a feedback loop
that [[affects global]{.underline}]{.mark} greenhouse gas
[[levels]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ocean circulation patterns also play an
important part. As [[Arctic ice melts]{.underline}]{.mark} and
freshwater flows into the ocean, it [[alter]{.underline}]{.mark}s the
[[salinity and density]{.underline}]{.mark} of seawater, potentially
[[slowing the]{.underline}]{.mark} Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (**[[AMOC]{.underline}]{.mark}**). A weaker AMOC could slow
the transfer of warm water northward, affecting climatic patterns far
beyond the Arctic \[80\]. Together, these feedback mechanisms show the
interdependence of Arctic changes, [[with each loop
exacerbating]{.underline}]{.mark} warming and changing not only the
Arctic but also [[the **worldwide** climate system]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Arctic warming risks global ecological disruption (could be 2+ cards)

6-23-2025)

The increased [[warming in the Arctic causes significant disturbances to
global climate]{.underline}]{.mark} systems [[by disrupting air
circulation and heat transfer]{.underline}]{.mark} processes \[219\].
One major impact is the [[destabilisation of the polar jet
stream]{.underline}]{.mark}, which controls weather patterns in the
Northern Hemisphere \[220\]. Arctic temperatures rise faster than at
lower latitudes, weakening the jet stream, causing it to meander and
stall \[221\]. This has [[result]{.underline}]{.mark}ed
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} persistent [[extreme
weather]{.underline}]{.mark} conditions, such as [[extended droughts,
flooding]{.underline}]{.mark}, and unseasonal cold snaps in areas far
from the Arctic \[222\]. In addition to the jet stream, the Arctic's
role as a heat sink is dwindling, reducing the Earth's ability to manage
heat distribution and fuelling increasingly erratic global climate
behaviour \[223\]. Melting Arctic ice is becoming a major contributor to
increasing [[global sea-level rise]{.underline}]{.mark} \[224\]. Unlike
thermal expansion of saltwater, [[glacier melt]{.underline}]{.mark}
introduces massive amounts of freshwater into the ocean, [[affecting
salinity]{.underline}]{.mark} and density gradients \[225\]. These
changes [[affect ocean circulation]{.underline}]{.mark} patterns, such
as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which could cause
localised cooling in Europe while exacerbating warming elsewhere
\[226\]. Coastal communities around the world face increased risk of
flooding, infrastructure damage, and forced migration \[227\]. The
Arctic's contribution to rising sea levels
[[highlights]{.underline}]{.mark} the dual complication of managing
local impacts while addressing broader [[global
vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} is
an important location of climatic [[feedback loops]{.underline}]{.mark}
that might [[impede progress]{.underline}]{.mark} towards global
[[climate targets]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Permafrost
thawing]{.underline}]{.mark}, which releases methane and carbon dioxide
stored for millennia, results in a self-reinforcing warming cycle
\[228\]. The loss of sea ice exacerbates [[the albedo
effect]{.underline}]{.mark}, as darker ocean surfaces absorb more solar
radiation, accelerating regional [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} global
temperature increases \[44\]. A less commonly discussed feedback
mechanism is the [[destabilisation of Arctic
peatlands]{.underline}]{.mark}, which may release massive amounts of
ancient carbon into the atmosphere \[229\]. These feedback mechanisms
not only exacerbate current warming, but also pose a
[[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} of exceeding [[climate tipping
thresholds]{.underline}]{.mark}, making global temperature stabilisation
more difficult. Arctic warming has far-reaching economic and policy
repercussions. Melting glaciers are revealing previously inaccessible
resources, including fossil fuels, offering a challenge to climate
mitigation \[72\]. [[Increased Arctic resource
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}, motivated by economic interests, might
[[undermine attempts to reduce global emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} if
not properly controlled \[230\]. Arctic warming emphasises the
limitations of current climate models, which underestimate warming
rates, [[complicating global climate]{.underline}]{.mark} projections
[[and policy planning]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Last year will be remembered for many things, both good and bad. But one
thing that seems undeniable is the mesmerizing impact of Sir David
Attenborough's BBC TV series Blue Planet II, which showed both the
breathtaking beauty of our oceans as well as the global threats they
face. Who will forget the closing scenes with all those shocking images
of ocean plastic? Blue Planet II isn't the first documentary to point
out that the ocean faces significant threats, including those from
plastic. The Ocean Elders have been raising concerns over oceans since
2010. But Blue Planet II came at a time when global attention on our
planet's oceans has perhaps never been higher. The shock of some of the
most isolated and pristine environments of the world being choked by
plastic combined with the brilliance of its narrative story underscored
the need for transformative global actions. The launch of the Ocean
Action Agenda by the World Economic Forum is one practical example of
setting up high-level global collaborations to tackle the issues facing
our oceans. In order for this initiative to maximize its potential, they
must also include a strong focus on the Arctic marine environment.
\[Graph Omitted\] While our planet contains five oceans - the Atlantic,
Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Southern (Antarctic) - it is [the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline} that [is most susceptible to climate
change]{.underline}. In fact these changes are happening in front of our
eyes; [we have lost over half the Arctic summer sea ice
already]{.underline}.

[There are four reasons why **[the Arctic]{.mark}** Ocean **[is
distinct]{.mark}** from other oceans [**and critical** to]{.mark} our
planet's [survival]{.mark}]{.underline}:

[First, [while]{.mark} this relatively [small]{.mark} (by ocean
standards) marine environment holds only 1% of the world's ocean volume
and occupies only 3% of the world's ocean surface area, [its **impact**
**on**]{.mark} the **[global climate]{.mark}** system **[is
disproportionately large.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Second, though small]{.underline} in area, [[it]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[scoops]{.mark} up [over 10% of global]{.mark} river [runoff]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} claims twenty of the world's 100 longest
rivers]{.underline}.

[Third, the Arctic marine domain [comprises]{.mark} about [a third of
the world's coastline]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[And]{.mark} fourth, the **Arctic** Ocean **[contains one-quarter of
the]{.mark} world's [continental shelf,]{.mark}** [of **immense
socio-ecological importance**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

On all counts, the little [Arctic Ocean holds its own on the global
stage.]{.underline}

[Despite]{.underline} its [importance]{.underline}, the [Arctic Ocean
sometimes goes missing from public ocean-talk as more 'local' marine
issues take centre stage]{.underline}. [A key point for non-experts is
to recognize that **[the Arctic]{.mark} Ocean [is]{.mark}** different
from other oceans and it is **[the critical driver of the global oceanic
conveyor]{.mark} belt**.]{.underline} For example, the [[**Gulf Stream
and North Atlantic Current** are]{.mark} strongly [regulated by]{.mark}
processes that occur in [the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Arctic
Ocean is remote to many of us, but [its influence can be felt
everywhere.]{.underline}

How do we know this? [Oceanographers have **[robust scientific
evidence]{.mark}** on the role the Arctic plays within our
planet.]{.underline} For instance, the [[global]{.mark} hydrological
[cycle determines]{.mark} the [distribution of water]{.mark} around the
planet]{.underline} -- [[and affects food and water security]{.mark}
globally]{.underline}. This cycle begins in warmer climates, with the
equatorial trade winds and mid-latitude westerlies. [It is [refined and
shaped by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [global [distribution of]{.mark} land
masses that]{.underline}, in the northern hemisphere, [collect
[precipitation]{.mark} and direct it poleward [through]{.mark} massive
[rivers]{.mark}]{.underline}. These [rivers introduce substantial
amounts of fresh water [into the]{.mark} upper layers of the
[Arctic]{.mark} Ocean]{.underline}, [[providing]{.mark} the required
[conditions for]{.mark} an [ice]{.mark} cover to form]{.underline},
[[and regulating nutrient]{.mark} supplies and biological
[productivity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But these [dynamics are undergoing unprecedented and worrying
changes]{.underline} that are already visible. Jonathan Smith, producer
of Blue Planet II, reflected on the new realities of filming in the
Arctic Ocean: "We were all set and ready to film but we needed two major
things -- walrus and ice. I had expected that walrus may be hard to
find, but I did not expect it to be hard to find ice in the Arctic....
the crew were all commenting how surprisingly warm it was." They were
not mistaken. Over many years, scientists have been recording [[changes
in]{.mark} global [temperature]{.mark}, **[hydro]{.mark}**logical
[cycles and]{.mark} sea-[ice cover]{.mark}]{.underline}. These changes
[[have]{.mark} all had [significant]{.mark} and eminently observable
[effects on the Arctic]{.mark} Ocean]{.underline}. Over the past two
decades alone, [summer sea-ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean has
decreased by about seven million square kilometres to just over 3
million square kilometres. This loss represents a surface area larger
than all but about a dozen countries in the world.]{.underline}

However, [[the **Arctic**]{.mark} Ocean is not just a passive victim of
anthropogenic change: it [also **drives disruptions back to the global
system in ways that were overlooked**]{.mark} even a decade
ago]{.underline}. Though the exact mechanisms are still debated, Arctic
[sea-ice loss]{.underline} may be [affecting both ocean currents and
mid-latitude weather patterns along our southern borders.]{.underline}
And the [processes occurring in the Arctic play a vital role in
connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic]{.underline}. The fabled
Northwest Passage is more than a destination for explorers and
commercial ship traffic; [[the Arctic]{.mark} is an oceanographic
freight train that [ties together and influences]{.mark} other [maritime
regions and]{.mark} the [global climate]{.mark} system.]{.underline}

Worryingly there are big [**[changes]{.mark}** in]{.underline} Arctic
[sea-ice cover, freshwater supply, nutrient availability and the
underwater light climate which **[are taking place at an accelerated
pace]{.mark},** with associated shifts in seawater chemistry and
biological activity, and alterations to habitat and food-web structure
that are [affecting the entire ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ocean [waters
are growing more acidic, and [oxygen]{.mark} concentrations have
[decreased]{.mark} by nearly [8%]{.mark} over the past 50 years
alone]{.underline}. From this perspective, it seems inevitable that the
ongoing and **[[rapid changes]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the physical
environment of the marine Arctic will **[[push]{.underline}]{.mark}**
existing socio-ecological **[[systems]{.underline}]{.mark}** - [small
and large]{.underline} - [**[beyond tipping points]{.mark}** and into
new regimes.]{.underline}

What this means is that [temperature, pH and oxygen changes [lead
to]{.mark} species **[extinctions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[threatening
**fisheries and food security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a new
report card on the health of the Arctic ocean, which conlduded: "The
report card calls marine microplastics an 'emerging threat' in the
Arctic, and it notes that a recent global survey shows that the Arctic
Ocean has higher concentrations of microplastics than any other ocean
basin in the world." When German scientists found 11,000 particles of
microplastic in one litre of melted sea ice from the remote Arctic,
everyone began to understand how widespread and serious this is.
Unbelievable as it may sound, the plastic soup has now reached Arctic
waters.

[Now, more than ever, **[it is imperative to]{.mark}** close the gap
between our newfound knowledge of the rapidly changing Arctic Ocean and
the corresponding **[develop]{.mark}**ment of new ideas and innovative
**[policies]{.mark}** from the public and private sectors [to
ensure]{.mark} the ocean's long-term sustainable use and
[resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Arctic Ocean has given us a screaming wake-up call -- [what goes on
'up in the north' comes with a high cost to societies around the
world,]{.underline} and the [Arctic and its Ocean are a key barometer of
global risk.]{.underline} It\'s time for us to listen.

increasingly being adopted [[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}18:

• A [[combination of wind and solar]{.underline}]{.mark} energy sources
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} predicted to be a [[feasible, reliable, and
affordable]{.underline}]{.mark} energy system in Longyearbyen,
Svalbard19. In Iceland, geothermal water (for heating) and hydro- or
[[geothermal-based power]{.underline}]{.mark} (for lighting) [[are used
for greenhouse production]{.underline}]{.mark}.

• In Alaska and Canada, [[passive solar thermal]{.underline}]{.mark}
greenhouse design20 and converting flare gas to heat, [[can extend the
growing season]{.underline}]{.mark} for highvalue produce crops as well
as sequester carbon dioxide.

• [[Biowaste]{.underline}]{.mark} from local fisheries, slaughterhouses,
sewage sludge and food waste [[can be converted into
bioenergy]{.underline}]{.mark}21, with residual digestate and compost
recycled into the circular economy. Economic feasibility, environmental
sustainability, availability of energy producers, and social acceptance
for implementing mature renewable energy technologies for food
production across Arctic regions must be systematically evaluated.

Practical limitations, such as limited windows to bring in renewable
energy equipment, intensive engineering requirements due to permafrost,
and heavy reliance on small-plane transportation, must be acknowledged.
Nevertheless, [[prioritizing renewable energy
investments]{.underline}]{.mark}, improving energy efficiency, and
infrastructure for food storage and transportation
[[enhance]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark}
of food systems [[while reducing]{.underline}]{.mark} both greenhouse
gas [[emissions and financial burdens]{.underline}]{.mark}. Critically,
th[[ese developments would provide communities with more control over

This study has attempted to close the identified research gaps and
simulated [[a fully sustainable self-reliant energy system based on 100%
RE resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[was found to be feasible with
local resources and economically viable]{.underline}]{.mark}. In order
to make the transition a reality, [[significant]{.underline}]{.mark}
capex \[[[capital expenditure]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [[are
required]{.underline}]{.mark}, almost tripling the current level by
2050. The reference system is characterised by heavy reliance on
imported oil, with diesel being used as the primary electricity and heat
generation source in many smaller communities. Hydropower is widely
utilised, though mostly concentrated in the more populated southwestern
regions. [[Significant investments into renewable]{.underline}]{.mark}
capacities [[will pay off as the total annualised costs would be
significantly lower in the future as diesel is phased
out]{.underline}]{.mark} and fuel and CO2 costs are eliminated.
Furthermore, smaller communities may have even higher economic benefit
from the transition, as [[diesel is reported to be delivered there
mainly by icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and only during seasons when
the ice is at its thinnest \[60\]. For example, the town of Qaanaaq with
a population of around 600 people receives its
[[only]{.underline}]{.mark} two shipments of diesel [[in late
summer]{.underline}]{.mark} \[60\]. The heavy dependence on imports and
[[challenging logistics contribute to the high cost]{.underline}]{.mark}
of diesel and electricity, [[necessitating substantial governmental

Arizona Agriculture: [Geopolitical experts]{.underline} at the New
England Complex Systems Institute [identify]{.underline} a specific
[[food price]{.mark} threshold above which protests become
likely]{.underline} when a population is starving. This [global
[flashpoint may be hard]{.mark} for us [to grasp]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Coming out of the military, what additional insights can you share about
the volatility of a country due to hunger? Dr. Ellis: That's a pretty
**[[well-established linkage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the relationship
[**[between food insecurity and]{.mark} political
[instability]{.mark}**[, which]{.mark} can also [turn
violent]{.mark}.]{.underline} To give you an [example, Russia lost about
a third of its wheat harvest in 2011 and banned all wheat exports. The
Middle East and North Africa were hit first and hardest because they
import so much of their wheat from Russia, but also because it caused
food prices to spike and then stay high. When people can't feed their
families, it **[undermines]{.mark} the legitimacy of political
systems**]{.underline}, so you saw all these **[[underlying
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [poverty, corruption, et cetera --
[come to a head]{.mark} with protests and riots]{.underline} that were
really [**[catalyzed by]{.mark}** anger over **[food prices]{.mark}**.
People run out of options]{.underline}, [so it's a catalyst for
political instability and conflict]{.underline}. [[It's]{.mark} also [a
vicious cycle]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[food crises]{.mark} don't just
[drive conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[conflict]{.mark} also
[triggers food crises, which]{.mark}** will in turn, **[deepen conflict
over resources]{.mark}** and worsen the humanitarian impact of
conflict]{.underline}. [[It's]{.mark}]{.underline} what the military
would call [[a]{.mark} **[threat multiplier]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
There's actually a famous quote by Alfred Henry Lewis -- "there are only
nine meals between mankind and anarchy." This goes back to what I
pointed out earlier, that [[this]{.mark} particular commodity [is
**existential**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[There's nothing people won't do
to ensure they have it]{.mark}.]{.underline} So, we have to think about
it as a question of both [national and global security]{.underline}, we
have to think about building more resiliency into those systems, and we
must think about where our most critical goods are coming from. Arizona
Agriculture: What region of the globe has the most concern for you?
Perhaps another way to say it, what [geopolitical
[flashpoint]{.mark}]{.underline} has you waking up at night worried? Dr.
Ellis: All of them right now. This can be a difficult question to answer
because today they [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} so
[[interconnected]{.underline}]{.mark}. The first thing that comes to
mind is [the **[Middle East]{.mark}**]{.underline} both because of the
conflict between [Israel and Gaza]{.underline} and the **[[potential to
escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [into a much larger war, but also
because parts of the Middle East and North Africa rank high in food
insecurity]{.underline}. They tend to be very [reliant on wheat
imports]{.underline}, much of which come out of the Black Sea, from
Russia and Ukraine, who are currently at war. So, then you can't really
talk about instability in the Middle East without reference to this
other geopolitical flashpoint because it has an outsized impact on
global food security. And if you're going to talk about the [Russian
invasion of]{.underline} [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, then you must
think about how its [outcome will [affect **China**]{.mark}'s strategic
calculation [in the **S**]{.mark}outh **[C]{.mark}**hina
**[S]{.mark}**ea,]{.underline} and if you're going to talk about that,
then you are also talking about freedom of the seas and [securing global
shipping and trade]{.underline}, which is a primary responsibility of
the [United States Navy]{.underline}. This is a problem because right
now the Navy is also trying to deal with the Houthis disrupting shipping
in the Red Sea, which is causing higher prices and supply chain delays
as ships are forced to bypass the Suez Canal and go all the way around
the southern tip of Africa, which adds significant time and cost and so
now we're back to the Middle East again. So, they [really are all
connected to one another and [any one]{.mark} of them [has]{.mark} the
[potential for cascading]{.mark} effects.]{.underline} Arizona
Agriculture: According to a paper by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), since 1960, global food production
has increased by 390% while land use has increased by a mere 10%. These
are the statistics that can give us hope. What else do you think Arizona
and [**[American ag]{.mark}**riculture]{.underline} do well? Dr. Ellis:
Well, we obviously [[do]{.mark} **[r]{.mark}**esearch a**[n]{.mark}**d
**[d]{.mark}**evelopment really [well]{.mark}]{.underline}, evidenced by
that statistic. We do [[scale]{.mark} really well.]{.underline}
Organizations that accumulate and market for small farmers play a really
important role in scalability in a way that allows smaller family farms
to survive and compete. That part of the system is one that I think
works pretty well for both producers and consumers. As a whole, the
system also does [[efficiency]{.mark}]{.underline} really
[well]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} I do think that [[we
should]{.underline}]{.mark} be looking more closely at how we might
[[balance]{.mark} that [with resiliency]{.mark}]{.underline}, and we're
probably overdue for a systemic risk assessment of our food systems at a
national level, especially given the numerous geopolitical and other
risks. The [[just-in-time]{.mark} economic [model]{.mark} that most
sectors]{.underline} of the economy [follow [is]{.mark}]{.underline} a
bit [[risky]{.mark} when]{.underline} you're [talking about your food
supply. [Markets might]{.mark} be really adept at **[adjust]{.mark}**ing
and reallocating, [but **ag**]{.mark}riculture **[is
different]{.mark}**\--]{.underline} [[when]{.mark} fertilizer [supply
chains are disrupted, **you can't simply absorb a**]{.mark} three-week
**[delay]{.mark}** like you can for other goods, [and]{.mark} the
potential **[consequences]{.mark}** of that on a large scale **[are
incomprehensible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I'm also not convinced we do
communication very well. We should be working together between farmers,
the supporting industries, and government to communicate needs and
develop strategies that better support producers and meet national
security priorities. For example, as far as I can tell, industry is
generally unaware of the geostrategic importance of [wheat]{.underline}
and the way it's been used as a tool of U.S. statecraft for over a
hundred years, or the way it [can be used to prevent and ameliorate
conflict]{.underline} so that we can avoid spending a lot more on
military solutions. Since overtaking the U.S. in 2017, Russia is now the
world's largest wheat exporter, which has led to all kinds of
geostrategic problems. Part of the reason the U.S. lags behind in wheat
is because wheat is behind other commodities in research and
development. That's something federal agencies could be supporting. It
could play a role in educating consumers about the benefits of GMOs. It
could be working on coherent trade policy for agriculture that supports
U.S. producers, boosts exports, and ensures we're obtaining necessary
inputs from reliable partners, not from Russia. Our partners overseas
are concerned about this too, but we haven't given them somewhere else
to turn for the world's most important food. If we can address some of
those weaknesses, then I think it would enable us to better capitalize
on our many strengths. Arizona Agriculture: Despite an expertise in this
extremely serious issue, food security, what makes you hopeful? Dr.
Ellis: At the risk of sounding cheesy, it's the ingenuity and spirit of
farmers. They're asked to make an incredible lift -- feed the world and
risk your lives and livelihood in an industry that is completely reliant
on something we can't control, the weather, -- and while you're at it,
solve the water crisis and climate change too, while also being the
first to deal with its impact. They're really the unsung heroes on whose
output we built the modern world. It's why the United States has been so
prosperous, why we can all go to work and do different things and pursue
our interests and make other stuff that makes our lives increasingly
comfortable. It's why the human species has flourished, it's why we've
sustained a population of 8 billion people on the planet, and yet we
just keep asking farmers to do more. And they just keep doing more, they
get up every day and keep innovating and keep problem solving and I
don't think most of the world realizes just how much we rely on them to
do that. So, I think whatever comes next, farmers will solve that too,
because they haven't let us down yet.

### 2AC \-- AT: Wind is Small

#### Even small amounts of wind reduce costs and increase capacity

energy can reduce total installed capacity required in zero-emissions
grids\", Nature, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50040-6) -- DOA:
6/8/24, MoState JG

As we have seen, [**[even]{.mark}** relatively **[small percentages
of]{.mark}** offshore **[wind]{.mark}**]{.underline} and wave [energy
[penetrations]{.mark}]{.underline} in a 2050 zero-emissions electricity
mix **[[have significant implications on the
grid]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One of the most remarkable consequences of
deploying offshore wind and wave energy we observe in this study is the
large (133 GW, or 17.3%) reduction between the scenarios in total
installed generation capacity in a 2050 zero-emissions Western
Interconnection. This [[decrease in]{.mark}]{.underline} installed
[[capacity is tied to less]{.mark} installed capacity [of
renewable]{.mark} resources [with intermittent]{.mark} diurnal
[generation]{.mark} patterns, such as solar energy, and consequently
less energy storage]{.underline}. This implies that these technologies
will play a key role in limiting the upsizing of generation capacity in
the grid, therefore [[limiting costs, as we move away from fossil
fuels]{.underline}]{.mark}. The results show that for offshore wind and
wave energy to induce \>10% reduction in the 2050 total system installed
capacity, offshore wind energy costs would have to decline to those of
the NREL 2022 ATB advanced scenario, and wave energy costs would need to
decline by at least 50%. The [U.S.]{.underline} Office of Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy [has]{.underline} even more [ambitious
cost targets for]{.underline} floating [offshore wind
turbines]{.underline} over the next decade: The Floating Offshore Wind
Energy Shot Initiative seeks to lower LCOE costs of offshore wind
turbines by more than 70%, to \$45/MWh by 203542. This is \$7/MWh less
than what the NREL 2022 ATB advanced scenario assumes floating offshore
wind will cost by 2035. According to NREL, for the ATB advanced scenario
to manifest, turbine sizes would need to increase at a rate that is
considerably higher than in recent years40. [Offshore [wind energy
innovation]{.mark} that [leads to cost reductions]{.mark} also includes
significant changes to the manufacturing, installation, operation, and
performance of wind farms]{.underline} 40. Wave energy would need to
experience similar innovations to achieve these cost reduction targets,
and the supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure to support the
deployment of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) would need to be
established. Fortunately, as offshore wind energy becomes increasingly
deployed, it is likely that the infrastructure built to enable its
adoption will positively influence wave energy cost reductions since the
two technologies share the same ocean environment and require similar
infrastructure.

While offshore wind and wave energy have faced many cost challenges
associated with the hostility of ocean environments, their [[costs are
expected to decline]{.mark} as supply chain infrastructure becomes more
developed, designs become more efficient and refined, [and markets adapt
to compensate]{.mark} offshore wind and wave energy [developers]{.mark}
appropriately]{.underline} for the ancillary services that these
technologies may provide to the grid (such as base-load support,
reactive power support, etc.). Wave energy in particular has a long way
to go when it comes to reducing costs by designing standardized WECs
that can be manufactured with streamlined techniques, a problem further
complicated by the fact the optimal WEC design can vary depending on the
dominant wave frequency at a given site23. Standardization may still
take place to create main categories of commonly used WEC designs which
can be refined individually and deployed in areas with corresponding
ocean conditions. Hence, there is still significant room for improvement
of these technologies and the physical, economic, regulatory, and
political infrastructure to support them.

[[Because]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[benefits]{.underline}]{.mark} that
offshore wind and wave energy may provide for the future zero-emissions
grid [[are]{.mark} so [significant, we recommend]{.mark} that [policy
makers]{.mark} design incentives to [stimulate
investment]{.mark}]{.underline}, research, and development of these
technologies that will drive their overnight and O&M costs sufficiently
down [to ensure that they become cost competitive]{.underline} with
other renewable resources. For wave energy to reach cost parity with
land-based wind by 2050, its overnight and O&M costs would need to
decline by \~80% and 70%, respectively, over the next three decades. For
offshore wind energy to align with the NREL 2022 ATB advanced scenario
costs by 2050, fixed-bottom and floating offshore wind energy overnight
and O&M costs would need to decline by \~43% over the next three
decades. Although these declines seem drastic, solar and land-based wind
energy have demonstrated momentous cost declines in the past decade.
Solar energy costs have decreased 80% and land-based wind energy costs
have decreased almost 40% since 201043. Hence, significant drops in
renewable energy costs are not unprecedented.

Additionally, the results of this study show that [[reduced offshore
wind]{.underline}]{.mark} and wave energy [[costs result in increased
collocation]{.mark} of the technologies [in an optimal
grid]{.mark}]{.underline}. Research suggests that through collocation,
grid infrastructure, O&M, and licensing [[expenses could all be
shared]{.underline}]{.mark} (which is not captured in this study). For
instance44, shows that two-thirds of offshore wind farm project
development costs can be shared with wave energy deployments. However,
the research on assessing collocation potential for offshore wind and
wave energy in the Pacific Ocean is severely limited. Capacity expansion
planners and offshore wind and wave energy developers should consider
co-design and the potential for collocation of these technologies to
avoid costly and inefficient integration in the future. Hence, if we are
to utilize the synergistic benefits of offshore wind and wave energy in
the most efficient way, there should be significant funding for research
surrounding collocation of these technologies in the coming years.

[[Japan and South Korea may also benefit from importing from
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially if new shipping routes open
due to climate change. Passage through the Northern Sea route going
along the Russian coast and the Northwest Passage through the Canadian
Arctic Archipelago is dependent on the ice conditions that previously
used to be available only for powerful icebreakers \[92\]. However,
[[seasonal traffic]{.underline}]{.mark} along those routes [[has
reportedly increased]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2010--2014 with

The end of an era of cooperation is [turning]{.underline} the
[Arctic]{.underline} region [into an unsettled proving ground for
nations competing for access to natural resources, trade routes and
military advantage]{.underline}.

At the heart of the breakdown in relations is [Russia's annexation of
Crimea and subsequent invasion of Ukraine, actions that alienated fellow
Arctic nations]{.underline}. [Further [tensions have been caused by
Russia's increased activity]{.mark} in the Arctic [due to warming waters
that make passage possible as Russia expands]{.mark} investment there,
asserts its boundaries [and facilitates China's entry]{.mark} into the
region.]{.underline}

[With the end of a cooperative framework, the Arctic is rapidly becoming
the next contested area in great power competition]{.underline}, and the
U.S. is in danger of being a day late and a dollar short. [It is time
to]{.underline} take the lead and [invest]{.underline} both civilian and
especially military [resources in this incredibly important
geo-political region of the world. Failure to do so may have serious
consequences.]{.underline}

The strategic importance of the High North

The [[High North]{.underline}]{.mark} is defined as the region north of
the Arctic Circle, or above 66.5 degrees latitude. The region
encompasses 6 percent of the earth's surface in an area of 8.2 million
square miles, two-thirds of which comprises the Arctic Ocean.

The area [[is rich in resources]{.mark} and is estimated to hold
one-third of the world's natural [gas]{.mark}]{.underline}, [13 percent
of global [oil]{.mark} reserves [and]{.mark} vast quantities of
[minerals]{.mark} and rare-earth metals]{.underline}. The [Arctic
[also]{.mark} offers]{.underline} [three [valuable trade routes]{.mark}
for navigating the polar region, including the Northwest Passage, the
Transpolar Sea Route and the Northern Sea Route, the latter of which is
normally open for only a brief period each year]{.underline}.

Finally, the [region is of continuing [military strategic
importance]{.mark} due to its proximity to the U.S. and Russia and [as a
crucial link between]{.mark} the [Atlantic and Pacific]{.mark} theaters
of operation]{.underline}. Its [location is [also essential for]{.mark}
communications infrastructure including
[satellites]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Access rights to resources are held by eight Arctic nations including
Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia and the U.S.
However, [due to]{.underline} the [region's economic and strategic
advantages]{.underline}, [both Arctic and non-Arctic nations seek a
presence in the region]{.underline}.

The end of cooperation

Until recently, the High North enjoyed geopolitical stability and
cooperation among the Arctic nations, including the establishment in
1996 of [the Arctic Council]{.underline}. An independent
intergovernmental body, the council [began its mission by serving as the
leading intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation and coordination
among the Arctic nations]{.underline}, Arctic [Indigenous peoples and
other inhabitants]{.underline} with a focus on sustainable development
and environmental protection in the Arctic.

[As the council evolved,]{.underline} its [members supported creation of
an adjunct Arctic Chiefs of Defense Conference consisting of periodic
meetings during which the highest-ranking military leaders of the Arctic
nations would resolve issues, foster collaboration and provide
transparency for regional military operations.]{.underline} This
stability earned the region the label of "High North, Low Tension."

Unfortunately, these [**[cooperation]{.mark} efforts were [deeply
damaged ]{.mark}**[when]{.mark} Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} illegally
[annexed Crimea]{.mark} in 2014 and [then attacked]{.mark} the sovereign
territory of [Ukraine]{.mark} in 2022]{.underline}. [As a result of
these acts of aggression, the]{.underline} [[council members
ostracized]{.mark} the **[Russia]{.mark}**n Federation [and froze
communications]{.mark}]{.underline}. Putin acutely felt this due to
reliance on foreign investment and technology to fuel his plans to
achieve polar great power status.

But [**[Russia has proven]{.mark}** surprisingly **[resilient]{.mark}**,
and [its economy has rebounded]{.mark}. Its [military]{.mark} has also
been [boosted by]{.mark} a resilient [industrial
base]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[There is currently **no dialog with
Russian**]{.mark} political or military **[leaders]{.mark}** in
the]{.underline} chambers of the [Arctic Council, and this has resulted
in a situation akin to having a "hot line" where neither side picks up
the phone when it rings.]{.underline}

At the same time, [[the traditional way of life was also explicitly
connected to negative security]{.underline}]{.mark} in references to
[[providing surveillance and patrols in remote
areas]{.underline}]{.mark} for the state: "On the Eastern border, the
reindeer herders operate as eyes and ears \[...\] and [[in a war
situation, these kinds of people are worth more than gold \[as\] they
have the equipment and know-how]{.underline}]{.mark} to survive in the
forest", as the same representative noted. Therefore we interpret that
if energy transitions happen at the expense of reindeer herding, it is
indirectly creating a trade-off with national security.

Similar connections between the development of the energy sector and
Indigenous populations\' rights in terms of culture and heritage were
discussed in the Norwegian interviews. As one 3rd sector interviewee
noted, "[[the cheapest form of defence is having people living in the
region." Developing wind power]{.underline}]{.mark}, as discussed [[as a
niche]{.underline}]{.mark} by the interviewees, in the remote areas
[[would benefit their socio-economic wellbeing]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
for strategically important areas, such as Vardø, wind parks are
precluded because they interfere with military air surveillance radars,
as another public official interviewee remarked. Unlike in Finland, the
effects of wind power turbines on radars is not a public topic in Norway
cf. \[33\]; nor is it willingly discussed with the regions involved. The
opposition to wind power was mentioned as shared with broader public,
too. However, previous research shows that supporters are also active
\[72\]. In the interviews, the rights of the Sámi and reindeer herders
were at the core of the opposition, because the conflict over land use
is serious and complicated: whether to use the land for renewable energy
production, such as wind production, to extract minerals for the purpose
of enabling the transition elsewhere or to support the Sámi and their
cultural heritage rights. Here lies some of the key points of messiness
of "the everyday" regarding security and its definitions, following the
positive security approach \[15\].

Norway

[[Norway has]{.underline}]{.mark} registered [[an
obligation]{.underline}]{.mark}, under the 2015 Paris Agreement,
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} the country [[will
reduce]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} by a
minimum of 50%, by 2030 (Ministry of Transport, 2023). Roughly half of
the emissions in Norway come from road traffic, thus a significant
reduction in this sector is required. To reach this goal, Norway has
stipulated that by 2025, all new cars sold in Norway must be
zero-emission vehicles: either electric or hydrogen (Ministry of
Transport, 2023). Whilst [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} is a step towards
combating climate change, the desire to increase the production of
electric cars [[has a cost, both in Norway and]{.underline}]{.mark} on a
[[global]{.underline}]{.mark} scale. [[The
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} of this development [[are often
shouldered by Indigenous and local communities]{.underline}]{.mark} who
are located [[in the rural regions where resource extraction
occurs]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[adverse effects]{.underline}]{.mark} of resource extraction [[are
evident in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Norwegian]{.underline}]{.mark}
case of the Nussir AS [[copper mine]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
Repparfjorden, located in Sápmi, which has been [[a focal point of
domestic and global debates surrounding the sacrificing of Indigenous
land in the name of the 'Green Shift]{.underline}]{.mark}.'
Additionally, the development of Nussir's copper mine affects the
seasonal reindeer migration routes which cross the areas occupied by the
mine (Tsiouvalas, 2020). [[The tailings]{.underline}]{.mark} from this
mine also [[have the potential to negatively impact the marine
environment and coastal Sámi communities]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Tsiouvalas, 2020). Whilst Nussir have claimed that the environmental
recovery of Reppardfjorden will take between 2 and 5 years, Terje van
der Meeren, a scientist at Norway's Independent Institute for Marine
Research, has explained that [[it would take almost 300 years
until]{.underline}]{.mark} completely [[unaffected marine life
returns]{.underline}]{.mark} to the area (Simpson, 2021).

Spinning Reserve and Grid Forming Inverters [[In an isolated
microgrid]{.underline}]{.mark}, frequency/[[voltage control and spinning
reserve are **vital** for grid stability]{.underline}]{.mark} and
reliability. When adding nondispatchable renewable resources,
synchronous diesel generators lose their ability to regulate frequency
via kinetic energy \[44\]. Therefore, in considering which [[renewable
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} sources [[are most suitable
for]{.underline}]{.mark} remote Arctic microgrids, supporting technology
must also be considered. Modern inverters can ensure [[grid stability
through]{.underline}]{.mark} grid-following, gridforming, or
grid-supporting modes. Grid-forming inverters
([[GFM]{.underline}]{.mark}) can emulate the dynamic behavior of
synchronous generators, regulating voltage and frequency while tracking
power imbalances due to disturbances in the grid, allowing remote
microgrids to overcome renewable integration challenges in inertia and
transient stability \[45\];\[46\].

Spinning reserve refers to the unloaded capacity of already
grid-synchronized generators and is a margin meant to adapt to sudden
drops in frequency. In many remote hybrid microgrid systems, spinning
reserve complements renewable energy generation as an ancillary service
to provide power to the grid immediately in case of changes in
stochastic resources. However, the spinning reserve is often supplied
through inefficiently loaded diesel generators. Instead, a grid-bridge
system could be implemented, shifting the spinning re serve capacity
from inefficient diesel to the GFM, to absorb short-term deficits in
power until the diesel generators are synched, allowing them to come
online at a fuel-efficient load \[46\]. Studies of GFMs in Arctic
microgrids show that [[GFMs]{.underline}]{.mark} provide significant
reliability to the system, [[abating]{.underline}]{.mark} transient
[[overvoltage following contingency events]{.underline}]{.mark} and
improving frequency deviation. Additionally, the grid bridge system
(energy storage-backed grid forming inverter)
[[abates]{.underline}]{.mark} significant [[diesel]{.underline}]{.mark}
fuel use \[46\]; \[24\].

2.2.4 Alternative energy sources and technologies in the Arctic

[[Renewable energy resources are highly localized]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The following sections highlight some advantages and potential
challenges of different renewable energy sources and energy storage
devices pertaining to uses [[in an Arctic remote energy
system]{.underline}]{.mark}. Energy [[sources and
storage]{.underline}]{.mark} technologies [[are evaluated
on]{.underline}]{.mark} their commercial [[maturity,
reliability]{.underline}]{.mark} (ability to be dispatched or
predictability), cycle [[lifespan, and feasibility]{.underline}]{.mark}
in a Greenlandic community energy project.

Solar PV and Wind: Both [[wind]{.underline}]{.mark} turbines and
[[solar]{.underline}]{.mark} photovoltaic ([[PV]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[are mature]{.underline}]{.mark} technologies. Despite being mature,
the [[use]{.underline}]{.mark} of solar PV in Greenland on a community
scale [[is limited]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Dramatic]{.underline}]{.mark}
and ongoing [[reductions in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[cost]{.underline}]{.mark} of solar energy and battery storage combined
with copious sunlight for seven months of the year
[[suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[solar and storage
could]{.underline}]{.mark} play an important role in
[[reduc]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[costs and dependence
on]{.underline}]{.mark} fossil fuels in Greenland and elsewhere in the
far north. Wind and PV hybridization in a specifically Arctic context
has been the subject of much research in hybrid microgrid optimization,
and results show that when in combination with sufficient battery
storage, PV and wind resources can reduce
[[diesel]{.underline}]{.mark}-based generation significantly and
reliably \[23\];\[24\]; \[36\];\[37\]. The results of [[these studies
are reinforced by]{.underline}]{.mark} the success of PV and wind
[[projects in Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark} \[33\].

[[Wind and solar PV are stochastic]{.underline}]{.mark},
non-dispatchable resources, meaning that they themselves cannot be
counted on to provide reliable energy continuously, [[but with battery
and diesel]{.underline}]{.mark} support, [[they can be
integrated]{.underline}]{.mark} into any grid relatively
[[easily]{.underline}]{.mark}. Wind presents additional challenges
regarding possible disturbances to migratory bird populations, noise,
ice throwing, and construction on permafrost or loose soils. Cold
climate wind turbine operation is well-studied, and much research is
dedicated to the optimal operation of wind turbines during icing events
and the mitigation and detection of icing on turbines \[38\];\[39\];
\[40\]; \[41\].

[[Bifacial panels are]{.underline}]{.mark} a potentially
[[advantageous]{.underline}]{.mark} technology for Arctic renewable
energy projects, considering the high surface reflectivity from snow
cover. However, there has been limited deployment of bifacial panels in
the Arctic. Currently, an operation bifacial system exists in Kotzebue,
Alaska, and a bifacial test site has been deployed in Fairbanks, Alaska
\[42\]. The Fairbanks test site reports bifacial [[gains of
13-27%,]{.underline}]{.mark} with gains consistently over 20% from
April- July. Overall, the research concludes that there is virtually the
same annual gain between vertical east-west-facing modules and
south-facing modules. South-facing modules performed better during the
fall and early spring, whereas vertical east-west-facing panels
performed better between March and June. Despite this research
demonstrating the success of bifacial energy production in the Arctic,
it is still unclear whether the additional costs of the system are
balanced by the increase in productivity \[42\]. The combination of
orientations can be used to smooth out daily production. A simulation of
solar energy production in Norway shows the potential for a 15% bifacial
gain for a 1 megawatt system with profitable levelized costs of energy
for low discount rates \[43\].

In response to this challenge, [[utilities]{.underline}]{.mark} are
[[form]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[local partnerships to
extend]{.underline}]{.mark} their limited internal
[[capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, KEA and AVEC are
[[collaborating with tribal organizations to]{.underline}]{.mark} secure
funding, develop infrastructure, and ultimately
[[operate]{.underline}]{.mark} systems [[under]{.underline}]{.mark}
independent [[power producer arrangements]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
model [[has been successfully demonstrated]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
northwest Alaska communities of Shungnak and Kobuk, where an advanced
solar--battery project owned by the local tribes has enabled diesel-off
operation since its completion in 2018. Through this approach, the
utility (AVEC) continues to manage the system, while generation
responsibilities are transferred to third-party producers, a concept
envisioned for larger grid systems in the future but already being
pioneered in Alaska today. Based on this success, similar arrangements
are under development in nearly a dozen other communities. It is
expected this will be the primary vehicle for funding the next round of
renewable energy project developments. However, it remains to be seen
whether this approach will reduce the delivered cost of power, retain
more economic benefits within local communities, and ensure long-term
technical capacity for system operation and maintenance.

Beyond financial support, [[**continued** technological adaptation will
be critical to]{.underline}]{.mark} enhancing the [[efficiency and
reliability]{.underline}]{.mark} of wind--diesel microgrids. While
Alaska has already proven the feasibility of high-penetration wind
systems, [[the next phase]{.underline}]{.mark} of innovation [[will
focus on deeper energy storage]{.underline}]{.mark} integration, [[more
advanced grid controls, and expanded wind-to-heat]{.mark}]{.underline}
applications. As a result, utilities like AVEC, which manage numerous
communities across a vast geographic area, have been preparing for
large-scale wind development by interconnecting nearby communities. This
strategy enables more communities to benefit from wind while improving
economies of scale. Additionally, AVEC has installed purpose built
[[grid-bridging energy storage]{.underline}]{.mark} solutions in its
communities to [[replace spinning reserves,
allowing]{.underline}]{.mark} for diesel-off operation or operation with
[[a smaller diesel generator]{.underline}]{.mark} with very modest
amounts of storage capacity to keep costs contained.

[[Policy adaptation will be crucial to ensuring the **long-term
viability**]{.underline}]{.mark} of wind integration in Alaska's remote
microgrids. While programs like the REF provide critical early-stage
capital, [[new frameworks are needed]{.underline}]{.mark} to support
ongoing operation, maintenance, and future advancements. One key area
for improvement is [[restructuring the power cost equalization
formula]{.underline}]{.mark}, which helps offset high energy costs for
rural residents, to account for wind-to-heat applications. This
adjustment [[would ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[communities with
wind]{.underline}]{.mark} generation [[are not unfairly
penalized]{.underline}]{.mark} by rate structures that fail to reflect
actual costs.

Strengthening [[knowledge-sharing networks among]{.underline}]{.mark}
Alaska [[and other Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and islanded [[regions
could further accelerate]{.underline}]{.mark} the transfer of [[best
practices]{.underline}]{.mark} and technological advancements. Beyond
its technological leadership, Alaska is actively engaged in global
knowledge-sharing initiatives. Through programs such as [[the Arctic
Remote Energy Networks Academy]{.underline}]{.mark}, a partnership under
the Arctic Council with Canada and Iceland, and the Energy Leadership
Academy, a collaboration with the Rocky Mountain Institute, Alaskans are
[[work]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[with energy champions
worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}. These partnerships create valuable
opportunities [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} exchange expertise, [[build
local capacity, and expand]{.underline}]{.mark} the deployment of
effective [[microgrid solutions in both Arctic and non-Arctic
settings]{.underline}]{.mark}.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE EXPLORATION AND MINING IN THE ARCTIC

Industries, such as the [[extractive industries]{.underline}]{.mark},
have a long history [[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[is
intertwined with]{.underline}]{.mark} the development of [[social
movements]{.underline}]{.mark} and legislation in the region. In
parallel to these movements, we are also [[in the midst of the green
transition which, if not managed correctly, could have unintended
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} for local communities and the
environment.

The motivation for this article came from the inspiring conversations
between a diverse group of young and openminded emerging leaders from
across or working in the Arctic who share a common vision of creating a
sustainable north, where [[voices and decisions]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the North are [[from the North]{.underline}]{.mark} and planetary and
human welfare are at the forefront of our actions. These conversations
[[highlighted that]{.underline}]{.mark} the topic of [[mining is not as
taboo as originally assumed, but]{.underline}]{.mark} instead, is a
[[part of our]{.underline}]{.mark} history and a part of our
[[future]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, it is up [[to us to
reimagine]{.underline}]{.mark} the future of mining and
[[how]{.underline}]{.mark}, and if, this [[might form a part of the
future of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

This article does not attempt to find a single solution when it comes to
the future of mining in the Arctic. In fact, many of our examples draw
upon solutions from a wide range of groups such as Indigenous
communities, government organisations, legislation, as well as the
mining industry itself. In acknowledgement of the inherent
interconnectedness of mining and the UN's sustainable development goals,
[[we aim to encourage conversations about mining in the Arctic, such
that a variety of voices can be heard]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have
focussed on providing a range of examples of mining and exploration in
the Arctic that have the potential to bring about positive benefits to
local communities and the environment. These examples include the
involvement of multiple different voices, particularly in the early
stages of a project, and led to design and implementation that braided
indigenous knowledge or ownership. What all of these examples have in
common is [[initially a conversation]{.underline}]{.mark}, something
[[that underpins FPIC and provides culturally and community specific
solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

We hope that [[showcasing more positive examples of mining in the Arctic
will bring about more constructive conversations]{.underline}]{.mark}
that help to reimagine mining. We hope that by [[sharing
these]{.underline}]{.mark} stories we [[can promote learning and
collaborations which will positively impact the]{.underline}]{.mark}
future of [[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

SUSTAINABILITY IN MINING

Looking to the future of [[mining in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}:
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} this industry [[provide an opportunity for
sustainable development and reconciliation]{.underline}]{.mark}?
Sustainable development has been defined as "development which meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs" (Brundtland Commission, 1987).
Whilst sustainable mining may be an oxymoron, [[sustainability in
mining]{.underline}]{.mark} [[leading to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
development of [[sustainable outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[is a
legitimate concept]{.underline}]{.mark} that we should be working
towards. [[Sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark} within the mining
industry can be multifaceted, encompassing
[[projects]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[aim to not only reduce the
environmental and social impacts of mining through
stewardship]{.underline}]{.mark} of the natural environment
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[also add value]{.underline}]{.mark},
creating something sustainable in the long term. Sustainable goals must
also include the development of, and continued effort towards,
[[building long-term relationships]{.underline}]{.mark} with communities
who are impacted by the mining process. [[Ensuring]{.underline}]{.mark}
that mining is sustainable is not just reliant upon [[ethical extraction
but also protecting the long value chain]{.underline}]{.mark} that
occurs after the mining has taken place. This process [[creates
environmental, social, and economic value]{.underline}]{.mark} which can
positively benefit the local communities.

For example, [[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} being built on
[[environmental disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}, Faro mine in Canada is
now home to [[the Faro Mine Remediation Project]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
government and Indigenous-led program. This program [[provides
employment and training]{.underline}]{.mark} opportunities
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} Kaska and other [[Indigenous
citizens]{.underline}]{.mark} (FARO Mine Remediation Project, 2022) and
is an example of a longterm project which provides opportunities for
locals whilst at the same time rehabilitating the environment.
[[Incorporating sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark} principles into the
lifecycle of a mining operation and beyond, has the potential to have a
positive impact on communities and, if incorporated [[into the early
planning stages, could contribute to the long-term
sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark} of the local area.

These questions are also [[particularly]{.underline}]{.mark} pertinent
[[in Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}, a country [[with 92% Indigenous
population]{.underline}]{.mark}, a great potential for mineral
resources, a large expanse of unexplored land and a limited history of
resource development (In 2020 there were 2 active mines in Greenland
compared to 1001 in Canada). Despite the small number of mines in
Greenland, some areas (such as in South Greenland) have been mined for
more than a century and a significant proportion of the population of
Greenland have some experience of exploration and mining operations and
are positive towards mining (e.g., Agneman, 2018; Thaarup et al., 2020).
As Greenland continues to be explored, coastal regions are becoming more
and more [[prospective]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the number of
[[exploration]{.underline}]{.mark} licences is slowly increasing.

The government and people of Greenland are currently battling with
questions of environmental, economic, and political opportunities. For
example, the controversial Kvanefjeld rare earth deposit is one of the
most significant rare earth deposits globally and [[presents an
opportunity]{.underline}]{.mark} for Greenland [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
become an internationally significant supplier of raw materials and
perhaps [[establish economic independence from
Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many local residents support the project
as it offers greater employment whereas other have raised concerns about
disruptions to the environment and the lack of adequate information,
particularly surrounding the potential radioactive pollution, and
failure to consult and seek local community's free, prior and informed
consent (FPIC) (Orellana et al., 2021). It should be noted, however,
that the main concerns around the Kvanefjeld deposit are related to the
presence of uranium in the ore. This is not reflective of the "typical"
concerns to other exploration and mining operations elsewhere in
Greenland, many of which are seen largely positively. A recent report on
sand mining [[in Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} surveyed almost 1,000
Greenlanders (\>1.5% of the population) and found that [[large
majorities support extraction but oppose foreign
involvement]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bendixen et al., 2022).

(ermo-MSDI, acc 6-23-2025)

[[Indigenous collaboration and ownership is increasingly common in
Arctic development]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit entities were partners or beneficiaries [[in nearly 20%
of Canada's]{.underline}]{.mark} existing [[electricity-generating
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2022 (Gall et al., 2022), [[most
of which produces renewable]{.underline}]{.mark} energy, [[reducing
reliance on diesel]{.underline}]{.mark} generators in these remote
regions. The Nechalacho rare earth project, located on the traditional
lands of several Metis and Dene First Nations groups in the Northwest
Territories, involves a 51% joint venture ownership by the Yellowknives
Dene First Nations, who will control mining operations at the site. This
project provides significant potential for Indigenous and northern
employment and economic benefit and is the first example of a First
Nations business entity contracting for a mine operation on traditional
lands in Canada.

[[Prior to]{.underline}]{.mark} the formation of international
instruments, such as [[UNDRIP, FPIC and ILO No.
169]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[decisions]{.underline}]{.mark} and
legislation made [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Arctic
mining]{.underline}]{.mark} sector [[were]{.underline}]{.mark} widely
[[done]{.underline}]{.mark} so [[by corporations
with]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[little]{.underline}]{.mark} to no
[[Indigenous involvement]{.underline}]{.mark} in the decision-making
processes. In 2018 the BC Regional Mining Alliance
([[BCRMA]{.underline}]{.mark}) was developed, an industry-led
[[strategic partnership between Indigenous groups, industry and
provincial government, that focuses]{.underline}]{.mark} on bringing
investment through collaborative partnerships. The Golden Triangle
region in British Columbia has been a hotspot for mineral and geological
exploration for the last 150 years and investments and developments made
by BCRMA has ensured that this region is becoming increasingly
accessible (BCRMA, 2023).

Additionally, in 2021, Suncor Energy announced an unprecedented step
forwards in terms of Indigenous and industry collaborations. They
announced a new partnership with eight Indigenous communities in Wood
Buffalo, this partnership allows the eight Indigenous communities to
acquire all of TC Energy's 15% equity interest in the Northern Courier
Pipeline Limited Partnership (Foulis, 2021). [[This
partnership]{.underline}]{.mark} is a reification of reconciliation
attempts and [[exemplifies the wanted change from
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[within extractive
sectors]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Large-scale [[renewable energy projects, such as offshore wind farms and

power]{.underline}]{.mark} systems [[lessen the need for

sequestration]{.underline}]{.mark} approach, [[and novel
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as carbon capture and biochar
synthesis, [[can further reduce emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Geoengineering options, such as maritime cloud brightening and
artificial ice floe creation, must be investigated carefully, with
international frameworks insuring ethical and effective implementation.
[Marine ecosystem preservation, including protected areas and
sustainable fisheries management, is important for biodiversity and
carbon balance]{.underline}. [[Community engagement is critical to

Geographic [[isolation]{.underline}]{.mark} is a common feature [[of the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[has long supported low-density human
populations]{.underline}]{.mark}. As some, but not all, traditional
Arctic rural communities may be in decline3 , [[a steady increase in
settler populations is triggering]{.underline}]{.mark} demographic and
cultural shifts, with increases in [[a **settlement-based**
lifestyle]{.underline}]{.mark}. Today, about 50% of the population in
the Arctic are not Indigenous4 . [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} further
[[imperils the ways and cultures of diverse Arctic Indigenous nations,
including food cultures]{.underline}]{.mark}5 , whose political and
cultural positioning remains marked by a history of colonialism. New,
[[non-traditional land uses are often
energy-intensive]{.underline}]{.mark} such as foods farmed4 where soil
conditions [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} temperatures hinder farming. They
also **[[jeopardize]{.underline}]{.mark}** the ways and [[cultures of
diverse circumpolar Indigenous nations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[It is important to increase **local capacity** for producing
food]{.underline}]{.mark} that meets local demand.
[[One]{.underline}]{.mark} emerging [[constraint is access to
sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[locall]{.underline}]{.mark}y
produced, and [[cost-effective **energy**]{.underline}]{.mark}:
[[electrical power can be **eight times** as expensive in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} as in lower latitude agricultural regions.

National governments continue [[to depend on fossil
fuels]{.underline}]{.mark} for electricity and heat generation [[in
Arctic communities]{.underline}]{.mark}. This dependence
[[threatens]{.underline}]{.mark} the economic, environmental, and
cultural [[sustainability of Arctic **communities** and subjects them to
future volatility]{.underline}]{.mark} and uncertainty. In Greenland,
the centralized government structure creates additional challenges for
northern communities [[by **limiting**]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[inclusion of local knowledge and priorities]{.underline}]{.mark} in
favor of national, standardized solutions. This research identifies
[[pathways towards fossil fuel reduction]{.underline}]{.mark} in
northern Greenlandic communities via 1.) analyzing the potential for
renewable energy inclusion in grid-scale or residential energy
generation and 2.) analysis of the potential for energy reduction in
housing. Furthermore, this research provides insights into the policy
tools that [[make]{.underline}]{.mark} energy generation and
[[conservation strategies financially and technically
accessible]{.underline}]{.mark} to residents of northern Greenland. A

practices of Indigenous communities]{.underline}]{.mark} (Figure 6),
[[which are inextricably linked to]{.underline}]{.mark} the region's
[[natural ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark} \[32\]. Climate-induced
changes in wildlife behaviour, habitat availability, and seasonal
patterns are affecting subsistence activities, such as hunting, fishing,
and gathering \[152,206\]. Earlier [[sea ice breakup restricts access
to]{.underline}]{.mark} marine animals, such as seals [[and
walruses]{.underline}]{.mark}, which are important for both food and
cultural practices among Indigenous Peoples \[203\]. Changes in
[[caribou migration]{.underline}]{.mark} routes and population

[[creating food insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} \[207,208\]. [[Cultural

identity]{.underline}]{.mark} \[209,210,211\]. As the temperature
increases, the health of Arctic people and infrastructure is expected to
face more challenges \[152\]. Thawing permafrost destabilises buildings,
roadways, and essential infrastructure, resulting in costly repairs and
increased safety risks \[212\]. Changes in precipitation and temperature
enhance health risks, such as respiratory problems from increasing
wildfire smoke and waterborne infections caused by poor sanitation
systems \[152,154\]. Food security is a significant issue, since
disruptions in subsistence hunting and fishing force communities to rely
on expensive and less nutritious imported foods \[213\]. These increased
vulnerabilities highlight the critical need for infrastructure
adaptation and public health measures that are targeted to the
challenges of Arctic communities. The melting of Arctic Sea ice has
created access to previously unexplored oil, gas, and mineral riches, as
well as the possibility of expanded shipping routes and tourism.

Access to traditional Arctic foods depends on access to traditional
Arctic lands. Historically, the sustainability of traditional Arctic
food systems is a fully integrated element of Arctic biodiversity.
[[Rapid climatic changes disrupt hunting and gathering traditions,

Biodiversity loss is often discussed but is neither effectively

Modelling. Despite the advances in measuring and monitoring permafrost
carbon dynamics, efforts to model Arctic changes lag. However, some
notable progress has been made. [[In the past 10 years, models have
produced the first reliable forecasts of permafrost carbon
release]{.underline}]{.mark}. Based the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, 15
model simulations all predicted a total loss of near-surface permafrost
(less than 3 m deep) over the region by 2100, with differences in the
magnitude of loss rates among the models (0.2 to 58.8×103km2 per year)7
(Fig. 4). The simulations indicated a total loss of 3 to 5 million km2
permafrost (mean loss 4PgC) in the RCP4.5 scenario and 6 to 16 million
km2 (mean loss 341PgC) for the RCP8.5 scenario. An increase in future
net primary productivity is modelled to increase vegetative carbon
storage from 156 to 954 TgC per year between 2010 and 2299. However, the
modelled [[vegetation carbon gains were not substantial enough to
compensate for]{.underline}]{.mark} even larger [[soil carbon losses
under]{.underline}]{.mark} RCP8.5, [[the **current** Arctic
trajectory7]{.underline}]{.mark} . The magnitude of this offset is
limited by temperature and nutrients, with wide variation in models
projecting CO2 plant uptake7,89,146,147 (Fig. 5).

Similarly, models focusing on small-scale permafrost processes forecast
an increase of \~12 times current carbon release by 2100 under RCP8.5
(ref.64). Deepening active layer thaw estimates for this period ranged
from one to eight times deeper relative to 2020, even without
considering ground subsidence in regions with high ice content64. [[As
models are refined, patterns of abrupt thaw emerge more
strongly]{.underline}]{.mark}, impacting soil temperature, soil moisture
conditions, surface fluxes and vegetation148,149.

Increasing wildfire disturbances. [[Arctic wildfires rapidly
expand]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[active]{.underline}]{.mark} layer of
[[permafrost, mobilizing carbon]{.underline}]{.mark}, burning vegetation
and promoting thermokarst development 21,88,89. [[Northern boreal
forests store substantial carbon stocks]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
[[loss]{.underline}]{.mark} of which [[could impact]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[PCF]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in the short
term]{.underline}]{.mark}90. As the climate warms, Arctic wildfires are
projected to increase 130--350% by the mid-century, releasing
above-ground biomass and a growing quantity of permafrost carbon, while
abruptly altering the landscape20. Increases in severity, frequency and
extent of wildfires in boreal landscapes underlain by discontinuous
permafrost and tundra landscapes with continuous permafrost can amplify
permafrost degradation, simultaneously altering the topography and
hydrologic flows91.

[[Permafrost thaw could transform]{.underline}]{.mark} some types of
[[below-ground]{.underline}]{.mark} organic [[carbon
into]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[flammable fuel for
wildfires]{.underline}]{.mark}. During 2014, wildfires in Canada's
Northwest Territories released 8.62 ± 1.05TgC to the atmosphere, with
\~30% of emissions attributed to the combustion of fuels that predated
the last fire and, thus, could be considered early-Holocene-aged
carbon20. This loss of legacy carbon during the 2014 fires represented
more than 20% of the mean annual net primary productivity in global
boreal forests20. In 2020, over 50% of Arctic wildfires burned
permafrost areas with high ice content, suggesting a substantive
transformation in fuel availability92. Moreover, wildfires are extending
beyond the traditional June--August fire season into the shoulder season
months. Overwintering or 'zombie fires' burn year-round underground,
even during the cold season21,92. These smouldering, below-ground fires
could release legacy carbon from environments previously thought to be
fire-resistant 21,92, and be responsible for up to 38% of the total
burned area in the Arctic93.

Incorporating [[wildfire disturbances]{.underline}]{.mark} and its
[[impact]{.underline}]{.mark}s on [[thermokarst
into]{.underline}]{.mark} permafrost and [[PCF models is a critical,
missing component]{.underline}]{.mark} of constraining projections of
future Arctic carbon emissions. Though difficult, the ability to
integrate changing dynamics into static [[permafrost system models and
observations is a necessary step to improving
forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark} and the detection of carbon release.

Discussion

[[Our analysis points to larger increases in Arctic
precipitation]{.underline}]{.mark} in the CMIP6 projections compared to
CMIP5, with the shift to an annually rain-dominated precipitation regime
occurring approximately one or two decades earlier, with the greatest
changes expected in autumn. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} earlier
[[shift]{.underline}]{.mark} towards a rain dominated regime in CMIP6
[[has implications for the stability of social-ecological systems in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and the rate at which system changes will
occur. This includes a further reduction in snow cover duration8, which
influences seasonality34, ecosystem processes such as tundra greening36,
wildlife populations and human livelihoods18,37. [[Reduced snow cover
will further exacerbate Arctic and global warming through
albedo]{.underline}]{.mark} feedbacks38, increased winter CO2 fluxes39
[[and methane releases]{.underline}]{.mark}40
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} soil41 and [[thawing
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}. These will additionally affect soil
moisture and groundwater, influencing flood risk42. The transition to
more rainfall will also impact the frequency of
[[rain-on-snow]{.underline}]{.mark} (ROS) events, which [[can be
devastating to wild caribou, reindeer and muskoxen]{.underline}]{.mark}
populations18,21,43, and result in a decline of fungal life44. Massive
mortality following major ROS events has important social-ecological,
cultural and economic implications18,21. Not all impacts will be
negative, however. For example, the population of migratory birds has
significantly increased due to a warmer and wetter Arctic45.

Microbially mediated emissions. [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} greenhouse
gas [[emissions are currently dominated by]{.underline}]{.mark}
microbially mediated [[CO2]{.underline}]{.mark} release70--72,
[[although thermokarst **development** could]{.underline}]{.mark}
increasingly [[provide a pathway for greater CH4
release]{.underline}]{.mark}27,73 (Fig. 3). Most current CO2 and CH4
fluxes are from carbon sequestered within the last 1,000 years73. While
the average Arctic CH4:CO2 ratio is 0.2, [[the current
ratio]{.underline}]{.mark} of CH4:CO2 emitted from Yedoma thermokarst
lakes in Alaska and Siberia [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} 0.3, with mean
annual CH4 output (129.6±8.6gCm−2 per year) [[lower
than]{.underline}]{.mark} mean [[CO2]{.underline}]{.mark} (449.0 gCm−2
per year)55. The ratio from non-Yedoma thermokarst lakes is similar
(0.25 CH4:CO2), indicating that CO2 dominates carbon emissions in a
variety of Arctic land cover types55. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark},
observed [[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} with Pleistocene-aged 14C
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[grow as Yedoma
thaws]{.underline}]{.mark}. Further estimates suggest that Yedoma could
lose an additional 354±196gCO2kgC−1 (C and Ce from oxic and anoxic
soils) by 2100 (ref.60).

Understanding carbon across scales [[As the Arctic rapidly changes, the
scientific community has sought to expand its capacity to monitor,
understand and predict transformation and carbon
release]{.underline}]{.mark}60,94,95. Instrumentation designed to sample
across spatial and temporal scales has improved understanding of abrupt
thaw dynamics26,27, the age and impact of released carbon3,35,96, the
effects of changing Arctic hydrology63,97 and the importance of
technological integration in forecasting future dynamics98,99.

[[Detection]{.underline}]{.mark} of carbon release [[spans multiple
scales and]{.underline}]{.mark} integrates data from multiple
[[methodologies]{.underline}]{.mark} (TABLE 1). For example, land plots
and flux chambers are used to quantify and characterize carbon release
from specific environments at the 1--10-m scale76. Eddy covariance (EC)
towers monitor surface--atmosphere fluxes of carbon, water and energy on
scales of 100--1,000 m (REF.67). At regional to continental levels, tall
tower networks complemented by larger-scale aircraft campaigns deliver
carbon release information on 10--1,000-km scales100. For observation
scales \>1,000 m, [[a growing number of satellite
sensors]{.underline}]{.mark} monitor surface and atmospheric variables
that [[can be used to infer carbon flux across the entire
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}101--103. This combination of observations
and model scenarios across scales provides a picture of rapid thaw and
an abrupt loss of carbon (FIG. 2), on the order of decades or less.

Laboratory-based research. Laboratory-based research (usually on samples
collected in the field) has produced important information on the
dynamics of permafrost microbial communities, including the myriad
survival strategies that have preserved extremophile permafrost microbes
for up to a million years in stasis. These adaptations include the
production of carotenoids104, high abundance of stress-response
genes105, lipid-rich membrane fluidity106, dormancy105,107 and DNA
repair108,109.

DNA-based analyses, including metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing,
have illuminated adaptations, origins, metabolic potential and microbial
community composition in representative permafrost samples70,110,111.
However, these analyses do not distinguish between live and dead cells,
which is critical to determining the carbon transformation potential of
microorganisms112. Therefore, advances in live--dead staining and
endospore enrichment with conditions controlling for pH, acidity and
carbon concentration are increasingly critical to determine the carbon
transformation potential of permafrost microbial communities112--114.

Incubation of permafrost and permafrost-affected soil samples is another
method used to understand microbially mediated carbon release. Carbon
release was 3.4 times higher in aerobic conditions than in anaerobic
conditions in permafrost incubations115. A greater loss of permafrost
carbon is, therefore, predicted for oxic conditions by laboratory
assessments and modelling. However, as this loss is expected to be
primarily in the form of CO2 emissions, [[an equal amount of released
CH4]{.underline}]{.mark} under anaerobic conditions [[has considerably
more warming potential]{.underline}]{.mark}60. The increase in activity
from reactivated microorganisms in anoxic conditions could increase
carbon emissions across the Arctic by 27--38 TgCH4 per year by 2100,
effectively doubling current CH4 emissions85. [[Therefore, determining
the processes driving the degradation and release of permafrost
carbon]{.underline}]{.mark} by the increased microbial activity expected
with permafrost thaw [[is essential to
understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} the transformation of permafrost
carbon.

5.4. Low-cost wind electricity to reverse melting of the Greenland ice
sheet

[[Climate change induced rise in sea levels]{.underline}]{.mark} has
been estimated to reach between 0.24 m in a RCP2.6 scenario and 0.32 m
in RCP8.5 scenario by mid-century \[101\]. Studies [[have
shown]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the Greenland Ice Sheet
is]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [[the largest
contributor]{.underline}]{.mark} to rising sea levels \[102\] and
estimates show it alone may contribute 0.274 m by 2100 \[103\] and more
than [[7 m in the long term]{.underline}]{.mark} \[7,8\]. Such increase
in sea levels [[can have catastrophic impacts on coastal
areas]{.underline}]{.mark} as many of them already suffer from flooding
during storms and unusually heavy rains. [[Low-cost wind electricity
from Greenland could]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially be used to restore
melting ice by producing technical snow using desalinated water. Water
desalination, vertical, and horizontal pumping require 3.15 kWhel/m3
water, 0.36 kWhel/(m3 water • 100 m), and 0.04 kWhel/(m3 water • 100
km), respectively \[104\]. Water is assumed to be horizontally and
vertically pumped by 2 and 500 km, respectively. Additionally, energy
demand for snowmaking corresponds to 2.56 kWhel/m3 water based on
\[105\]. In order to remove 1 mm of sea level, 361.8 km3 of water need
to be removed \[106\]. With such assumptions, 47.4 PWhel/(cm•a) would be
needed to desalinate, pump, and freeze water. In total, to remove the
minimum expected sea level rise by 2050, i.e., 0.24 m of water within 30
years, 1138 PWhel are needed, an extremely high number compared to an
annual maximum estimated [[396 PWh total primary energy demand globally

not be the only obstacle, as the high capex of snow guns and extremely
high numbers of such equipment may be too difficult to achieve, thus
necessitating other measures to mitigate climate change and adapt to its
impacts.

Owing to the diversity of processes driving it, [[there is ongoing
uncertainty in forecasting abrupt thaw, making it increasingly important
to resolve the mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark} that result in permafrost
carbon emissions. [[The impacts of abrupt thaw are not incorporated
into]{.underline}]{.mark} a majority of [[current PCF
models]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, therefore, into few ESMs,
[[substantially increasing uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark} in estimates
of future carbon flux. For example, the high fluxes of contemporary
carbon (1950 to present) in Siberian rivers mask the signal of Holocene
and Pleistocene carbon released in abrupt thaw41. Systematic radiocarbon
(14C) measurements of dissolved carbon in Arctic river networks (by the
Arctic Great Rivers Observatory, for example) could be used to trace
mobilization of carbon from Holocene, Pleistocene and older deposits.
Such [[measurements could provide early warning of abrupt or subsurface
permafrost thaw]{.underline}]{.mark} over vast areas.
[[Classifying]{.underline}]{.mark} the lability of [[deep permafrost
carbon]{.underline}]{.mark} and ground ice density
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[critical to accurately

The Arctic faces major energy-related changes: its production,
consumption and transportation must be decarbonised. Furthermore,
geopolitical interests in the area are growing, with tensions around
land use expected to increase. In this paper, we investigate energy
transition processes in the Finnish and Norwegian Arctic from the niche
development and regime decline viewpoints. We mirror these processes
onto [[concepts of positive and negative security]{.underline}]{.mark}
to analyse the security environment affecting the transitions. We
hypothesise that notions of security [[can explain delays in
transitions]{.underline}]{.mark}. We analysed recent Finnish and
Norwegian Arctic strategies and expert interviews to examine how energy
transitions are discussed in the security context.
[[Although]{.underline}]{.mark} energy and defence [[policies are
national rather than regional]{.underline}]{.mark}, the analysis
revealed interesting [[Arctic-wide issues]{.underline}]{.mark}. While
strategies [[mainly concentrated on]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[justifying]{.underline}]{.mark} support for [[fossil fuel production
for]{.underline}]{.mark} socio-economic and [[national
security]{.underline}]{.mark} purposes, the interviewees discussed more
nuanced approaches to developing the energy transition. [[Notions of
justice during the transition]{.underline}]{.mark} received attention in
both countries in relation to security, with the local population
[[gain]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[a deeper sense of
responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark} for the areas they inhabit. We call
[[for positive security to support sustainable
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} transitions, where uncertainty and
[[responses to]{.underline}]{.mark} changes are
[[dynamic]{.underline}]{.mark} and based on [[multi-actor
processes]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Positive security solves

[[Although both countries follow comprehensive security principles,
climate security was **not** strongly visible]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the documents in the sense of reducing emissions from the fossil fuel
sector. [[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} and the risks brought by
it are an undercurrent in the area in general and is [[considered a
landscape pressure]{.underline}]{.mark} to allow continued development
in the area, [[despite its negative implications]{.underline}]{.mark}
for the environment and Arctic inhabitants. This is part of [[human
security thinking]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[calls for attention to
communities **first** before **scaling up**]{.underline}]{.mark} towards
inclusive and just development \[51\]. [[Including]{.underline}]{.mark}
human security and [[positive security]{.underline}]{.mark} perspectives
[[in the]{.underline}]{.mark} planning and development of the [[Arctic
would **enable**]{.underline}]{.mark} a fair [[distribution
of]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[benefits and]{.underline}]{.mark} burdens
\[9\], with [[a deep awareness of]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[actual
impact]{.underline}]{.mark}** of measures on the people who are affected
by them. According to our findings, there is also a wish to participate
in providing negative security through the knowledge and possibilities
that people have. This contrasts with the way that "participation" is
currently interpreted: the land is seen as a provider of vitally needed
less-polluting energy and the material and minerals needed to produce
it. When thinking about positive security from the broader conceptual
perspective, our findings indicate that the [[people living and
operating in the Arctic are calling for positive, inclusive and just
security]{.underline}]{.mark} that they themselves are part of defining
and thus defending. The energy transitions in both countries [[are
inevitably]{.underline}]{.mark} part of [[directing the
process]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the unequal position of participants
in decision-making must be recognised and addressed.

## Politics 

### Republicans support renewable energy

**Bipartisan support for renewable energy development, not a partisan
issue, even wide GOP backing for initiatives.**

**Greenbacker, 2024** Renewable Energy's Resilience Beyond the 2024
Election Greenbacker Whitel Paper
https://greenbackercapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Election-white-paper.pdf

[[A critical factor supporting renewable energy investment post-2024 is
the well-supported legislative framework underpinning investment
incentives.]{.underline}]{.mark} In particular, the Investment Tax
Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) programs have been
instrumental in supporting the growth of the solar and wind energy
industries to date. [[Historically, these tax credits have enjoyed
bipartisan support, even during periods when the broader Republican
party did not strongly favor renewable energy.]{.underline}]{.mark}
While ITCs were originally created under Democratic President Jimmy
Carter in the late 1970s,1 renewables tax advantages were expanded even
further by Republican President George H. W. Bush when he signed the
Energy Policy Act into law in 1992. It was a Republican senator, Chuck
Grassley of Iowa, who sponsored the legislation that created the
original PTC in the 1990s. His website even dubs him the "father of the
first-ever wind energy production tax credit."2 When the solar ITC
credits were scheduled to phase out, from 30% in 2019 to 10% by 2022, a
bill passed under the Trump administration extended the 26% ITC through
2022.3 This demonstrates that [[even during conservative
leadership---and, specifically, a Trump presidency---renewable energy
incentives have received support, highlighting that the continued
expansion of renewables is not purely a partisan
issue]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since then, the Inflation Reduction Act
(IRA) has expanded and extended the solar ITC further, to 30% through
2032. [[Today, many Republican lawmakers, especially those from states
benefiting from increasing clean energy investments, continue to support
clean energy incentives. Support]{.underline}]{.mark} from Grassley and
other like-minded Republicans in Congress, including Utah Senator Mitt
Romney4 and Maine Senator Susan Collins,5 [[bolsters the likely
continuation of bipartisan backing for clean
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

As [Congress](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/congress) debates budget
bills proposing deep cuts in federal spending, [[Biden-era tax credits
for clean energy have gained crucial support among some
[Republican](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican) lawmakers and
voters]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Four Republican senators [wrote to their
party\'s

April 9 to \"caution against the full-scale repeal\" of tax credits in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Inflation Reduction Act ([[IRA) that support
investments in renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark} installations,
battery manufacturing, energy efficiency improvements and the production
of alternative fuels. The senators---Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry
Moran of Kansas, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Curtis of
Utah---warned that [[removing the credits \"could lead to significant
disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global
energy leader]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" The senators join a group of 21
[Republicans](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republicans) in the House
of Representatives who made a similar plea last month in a letter last
to the House speaker defending the tax credits. Zach Friedman, senior
director of federal policy for the nonprofit climate group Ceres, said
the [Senate](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/senate) letter is especially
notable because Senator Tillis serves on the Senate Finance Committee
which will play a key role in the budget bill\'s development in the
coming months.

#### GOP-led states have empirically been leaders in renewable energy development

[[Wind and solar power have become leading sources of zero-carbon energy
in recent decades]{.underline}]{.mark}, playing a significant role in
the U.S. energy grid. While renewable energy initiatives are often
linked to Democratic climate policies, [[Republican-led states have
embraced wind and solar energy as strategic investments. These
initiatives align with conservative priorities, such as boosting
domestic energy production and reducing energy
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}. From expansive wind farms in Texas to solar
installations in Florida, traditionally "red states" are at the
forefront of America's renewable energy transformation.
