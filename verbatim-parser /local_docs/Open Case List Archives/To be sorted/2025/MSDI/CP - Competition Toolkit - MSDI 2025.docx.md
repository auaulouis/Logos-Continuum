### Resolution Text

#### Resolved: The United States federal government should significantly increase its exploration and/or development of the Arctic

## How to Debate Competition

### Overview

#### The core controversy of counterplan competition debates is whether the CP presents a legitimate opportunity cost to the plan. In the context of "perm do the counterplan" debates, the affirmative will argue that the plan and counterplan are too similar for the CP to present a legitimate opportunity cost, and the negative will argue against this. 

### Textual Competition

#### Textual competition focuses on the actual words of the plan and counterplan texts. The counterplan is textually competitive if its text cannot be combined with the plan text without creating contradictions. 

#### For example, if the affirmative plan was "vote AFF" and the negative counterplan was "vote NEG," those would obviously be textually incompatible.

#### The Consult CP isn't generally considered to be textually competitive because it only adds additional words that could easily be combined with the plan. 

### Functional Competition

#### Functional competition focuses on the substantive mechanisms of the both the plan and counterplan. Even if its wording is compatible with the plan, a counterplan is functionally competitive if it results in a different outcome or changes the process of the plan. If the plan and CP contain substantively incompatible functions, combining the two would result in a contradiction, and the CP is said to compete functionally.

#### The Consult CP [is]{.underline} generally considered to be functionally competitive because "doing the plan" is a contradiction with "doing the plan *[if]{.underline}* the Arctic Council agrees."

### Controversy in Debates

#### When reading process CPs like the Consult CP, NEG teams prefer to argue that we should only evaluate competition based on function, rather than text only or text and function. If counterplans like Consult that add compatible words must be textually competitive, it's virtually impossible for them to win that the CP is competitive.

#### When refuting process CPs like Consult, AFF teams will generally argue that counterplans should be both textually AND functionally competitive. This benefits the AFF by limiting out counterplans that result in very similar policies as the plan and are difficult to substantively refute.

#### AFF teams will rarely argue for only evaluating competition based on text because this standard is overly limiting for the NEG; if every counterplan must be textually incompatible with the plan, the number of legitimate counterplans the NEG could read drops significantly. To combat this, AFF teams argue that counterplans must meet both standards of competition as a middle ground.

# Perm Blocks\-\--Consult

## AFF

### 2AC\-\--Perm: Do the CP

#### Perm: do the counterplan.

#### Our [interpretation]{.underline} is that counterplans must be both [textually]{.underline} AND [functionally]{.underline} competitive. Anything else justifies counterplans that just [replace words]{.underline} or [delay]{.underline} the plan. Those destroy [clash]{.underline} and [fairness]{.underline} because they [steal]{.underline} the plan and force us to debate [unpredictable]{.underline}, contrived opportunity costs.

### 1AR\-\--Perm: Do the CP

#### Extend our interp: Counterplans must be functionally AND textually competitive. Our interp is best:

#### 1. [EDUCATION]{.underline}. It forces [net benefits]{.underline} that relate to the [plan]{.underline}. Consult CPs can be read on any topic and aren't [textually]{.underline} competitive even though they compete [functionally]{.underline}. Topic specificity [outweighs]{.underline}: It's key to [topic education]{.underline}, which is the [only benefit]{.underline} to this specific topic.

#### 2. [FAIRNESS]{.underline}. They justify "[penny less]{.underline}" CPs [virtually identical]{.underline} to the AFF. CPs to do the plan "by spending a [penny less]{.underline}" or do the plan "except in [one city]{.underline}" create an [unfair]{.underline} AFF burden by forcing us to [predict]{.underline} and [defend against]{.underline} infinite differences that are [unrelated]{.underline} to the topic. 

#### \[[Make sure to answer the NEG's 'ground' and 'limits' offense in the 1AR too!]{.mark}\]

### 1AR\-\--AT: 'Resolved'

#### 'Resolved' can [include]{.underline} consultation.

**Webster 19** \[Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, 2019, "resolved",
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resolved, njn\]

: to become separated into component parts

[also]{.underline} : to become reduced by dissolving or analysis

2 : [to form a resolution : DETERMINE]{.underline}

3 : [[**CONSULT**, DELIBERATE]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 1AR\-\--AT: 'Should'

#### '[Should]{.underline}' is [*un*certain]{.underline} and explicitly allows [conditions]{.underline}.

**Hoffman 83** \[George B. Hoffman Jr. (Was the first chief judge,
Indiana Court of Appeals; current senior judge, appellate court) in
concurrence with GARRARD and STATON, JJ., 4-18-1983, "Duke\'s GMC, Inc.
v. Erskine," No. 4-782A226, Court of Appeals of Indiana, Third District,
https://law.justia.com/cases/indiana/court-of-appeals/1983/4-782a226-6.html,
njn\]

Duke\'s GMC, Inc., alleges error in the giving of several jury
instructions which were tendered by Erskine. The first of these was
tendered Instruction No. 9\[3\] which Duke\'s GMC, Inc., claims was a
mandatory instruction that failed to include any reference to the
defenses that were raised. Although not clearly explained in its brief,
it is assumed that [Duke\'s GMC, Inc., considers the instruction
mandatory due to the use of the work \"should\"]{.underline} in the
instruction.

[[\"**Should**\" is]{.mark} defined]{.underline} in The American
Heritage Dictionary [as]{.underline}

\"\... 2. [Anticipation of [a **probable occurrence**]{.mark};
expectation]{.underline}: \... . 3. [Condition; [**contingency** of
**one condition**]{.mark} upon another]{.underline}: \... . 4.
[[**Uncertainty** in a **future event**]{.underline}]{.mark}: \... . 5.
Moderation of the directness or bluntness of a statement with some
implication of the unusual or surprising: \... . Usage: [Should, in
[indicating **obligation**]{.mark} or necessity,
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} somewhat [[**weaker** than ought and]{.mark}
**appreciably weaker** than [must]{.mark} and **have
to**]{.underline}.\" The American Heritage Dictionary of the English
Language, New College Edition (1976) p. 1199.

[\"Should\" does **[not]{.mark}** connote a **[compulsory]{.mark}
result** as]{.underline} does [\"**will**\" or
\"**shall**.\"]{.underline} [It [leaves]{.mark} some [room for]{.mark} a
**[contingency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Parents of teen-age children know
that simply because they tell their children that they should do
something does not mean that the children will do it.

\*1123 A similar problem arose when the word \"would\" was used in an
instruction. At that time, this Court said, \"The use of the word,
\`would,\' does not make this a mandatory instruction. The word,
\`would,\' has been held to express merely a possibility or a
contingency. Landry v. Steamship Mutual Underwriting Ass\'n., 177 F.
Supp. 142, 147. Certainly it does not make the instruction under
consideration mandatory in character.\" David Johnson Co., Inc. v.
Basile (1964), 136 Ind. App. 611, at 613, 199 N.E.2d 478, at 480.
Likewise, [[use of]{.mark} the word \"**[should]{.mark}**\" does
[**not**]{.mark} make the instruction under consideration in this case
**[mandatory]{.mark}** in character.]{.underline}

#### "Should" can [include delay]{.underline}.

**Brown 8** \[Mary Ann Brown (Judge, Iowa Court of Appeals) 5-14-2008,
"In re Est. of Guthrie," 752 N.W.2d 452, Westlaw, njn\]

Brock and Kaitlyn look to [the word **["should"]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in the phrase "in the event any of my children should predecease me" and
claim [the district court]{.underline} improperly [found the word
[looked to the **future**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They claim the word
should be interpreted as the past tense of "shall" to imply a duty or
obligation. See Black\'s Law Dictionary 1379 (6th ed.1990). [[Looking at
the phrase **as a whole**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [rather than at
a **single word**, we determine [the phrase is considering **possible
future events**]{.mark}]{.underline}. See In re Estate of Grulke, 546
N.W.2d 626, 627 (Iowa Ct.App.1996) (noting we must ascertain a
testator\'s intent from the entire will).

## NEG

### Perm\-\--AT: Do the CP\-\--2NC

#### 'Do the CP' [severs]{.underline}, which is a voting issue for [NEG ground]{.underline}: 

#### 1. '[Resolved]{.underline}' means the plan must be a [certain]{.underline} enactment.

**Words and Phrases 64** (Permanent Edition)

Definition of [the word "**[resolve]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} given by
Webster [[is "to express]{.mark} an opinion or
**[determination]{.mark}** by resolution or vote]{.underline}; as 'it
was resolved by the legislature;" It is [of [similar]{.mark} **force**
[to]{.mark} the word "**[enact]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} which is defined
by Bouvier as [meaning "to **establish by law**".]{.underline}

#### 2. '[Should]{.underline}' is [mandatory]{.underline}.

of Appeals of Michigan, Kalamazoo Circuit Court, LC No. 2013-000499-CK,
Justia, njn\]

2017 Mich. App. LEXIS 1178, Lexis

The specifications in the drawings for the mini-piles stated that the
capacity for the mini-piles was \"to be\" 6,000 or 8,000 pounds and that
the length of the mini-piles was \"to be\" adequate to get into
undisturbed soil to a depth adequate for obtaining the required
capacity. The specifications in the project manual stated that the
mini-piles \"should\" have a capacity of 4 tons and 3 tons, that the
mini-piles \"should\" be driven to minimum depth of 25 feet, and that a
grout bulb \"should\" be formed at the base of a mini-pile. Kenneth
Winters, an expert in structural engineering, and Richard Anderson, an
expert in geotechnical engineering, agreed with Steve Maranowski,
plaintiff\'s president, that the specifications in the project manual,
because those specifications used [the word \"should,\" were permissive
and suggestions of what plaintiff could do]{.underline} to achieve the
required capacity. [However, [the]{.mark} **trial
[court]{.mark}**]{.underline}, when it instructed the jury on how to
interpret the contract, [instructed the jury that it was to
**[interpret]{.mark}** the [words]{.mark} of the contract [by]{.mark}
giving them their **ordinary** and [**common**
meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}. An ordinary and common meaning of [the
word \"**[should]{.mark}**\" is that it [denotes]{.mark} a
[**mandatory** obligation]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[\*9\] [See People v
Fosnaugh]{.underline}, 248 Mich App 444, 455; 639 NW2d 587 (2001)
(stating that [\"the word **\'should\'** can]{.underline}, in certain
contexts, [connote an **obligatory** effect\"]{.underline});
[Merriam-Webster\'s]{.underline} College Dictionary (11th ed) ([defining
\"**should**,\"]{.underline} in pertinent part, [as \"used in auxiliary
function to express **obligation**, propriety, or
expediency\"]{.underline}). Accordingly, viewing the evidence in a light
most favorable to defendant, reasonable jurors could have honestly
reached different conclusions on whether the specifications in the
project manual were mandatory and, because Maranowski admitted that
plaintiff did not use grout bulbs and did not drive all the mini-piles
at least 25 feet into the ground, whether plaintiff breached the
contract. Morinelli, 242 Mich App at 260-261.

#### AND 'should' is [immediate]{.underline}. 

**Stetler 18** \[Russell Stetler (National Mitigation Coordinator for
the federal death penalty projects, Office of the Federal Public

Profession: Fulfilling the Constitutional Requirement of Individualized
Sentencing in Capital Cases,\" Hofstra Law Review, Vol. 46, Issue 4, pp.

By the mid-1980s, there was increasing recognition of the need for
multidisciplinary teams, including nonlawyers, who would give fulltime
attention to social history investigation. 66 Not surprisingly, the
first defense bar organization to attempt to set out standards in
capital defense was the nation\'s leading association of counsel for the
indigent, the [National Legal Aid and Defender Association]{.underline}
(\"NLADA\").67 After circulating preliminary drafts over a period of
years, **[NLADA]{.underline}** first published its Standards for the
Appointment of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases in 1985.68
Standard 11.4.1 (D)(3)(C), Investigation, noted the potential use of
mitigation specialists-a historic first acknowledgment of mitigation
specialists as capital defense team members. 69 [The introduction to the
1985 Standards **stressed** that the word \"**should**\" had been used
as a **mandatory** term: \"what counsel **[\'should\']{.mark}** do [is
intended]{.mark} as a **standard** [to be met **now**, not]{.mark} an
**ideal** to be [attained]{.mark} at a **[later]{.mark}**
time.\"]{.underline} 70

70\. 1987-88 NLADA PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, supra note 68. Both the
Original ABA Guidelines and the 2003 revision adhere to the same view of
counsel\'s duties. As summarized in the Guidelines, these [[duties are
**not aspirational**, but]{.mark} reflect [what]{.mark} counsel ought
[to do **now**]{.mark}]{.underline} based on prevailing norms. [See ABA
Revised Guidelines]{.underline}, supra note 2, at 919 n. 1 (\"[As in the
first edition \'should\' is a **mandatory** term]{.underline}.\").

#### The counterplan is [distinct]{.underline}: It's neither [certain]{.underline} nor [immediate]{.underline} because there's [no guarantee]{.underline} that the Arctic Council will [say yes]{.underline} and the process of consultation is [time consuming]{.underline}.

#### [Prefer]{.underline} our interpretation: 

#### 1. [LIMITS]{.underline}. Their interpretation defines the [Consult CP]{.underline} as a [topical]{.underline} AFF, which is [unfair]{.underline}\-\--adding consult to every AFF would 

#### 2. [NEG GROUND]{.underline}. Ensuring that the AFF is both certain and immediate is [necessary]{.underline}\-\--every disad relies on the guarantee that the [guaranteed]{.underline} implementation of the plan. 

#### 3. [EDUCATION]{.underline}. The Arctic Council is a [core]{.underline} part of the topic, and debates about [unilateral]{.underline} vs. [multilateral]{.underline} action in the Arctic are [good]{.underline}.
