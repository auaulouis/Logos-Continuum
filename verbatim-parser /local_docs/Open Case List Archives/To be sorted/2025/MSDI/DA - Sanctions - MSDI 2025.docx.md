Thesis -- if the negative can win that current Ukraine sanctions on
Russia are a barrier to plan implementation, that means the plan fiats
or results in reduced sanctions. This DA says reducing sanctions is a
dangerous signal, and greenlights a Russian invasion of the Baltic
states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), which unlike Ukraine are
protected under Article 5 forcing NATO into a declared war with Russia.

CONCLUSION

[[The sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} imposed [[on
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[significantly impacted its
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} ambitions, affecting [[economic projects,
diplomatic engagements, military strategy, and scientific
research]{.underline}]{.mark}. These challenges offer an opportunity to
rethink Arctic governance and cooperation, highlighting the need for
sustainable development, adherence to international law, and inclusive
dialogue. [[The current geopolitical climate underscores the importance
of balancing national interests with collective goals for the Arctic
region]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moving forward, a multifaceted approach
prioritizing diplomacy, environmental protection, and respect for
indigenous communities is crucial for the stable and sustainable
development of the Arctic.

#### Sanctions are working -- peace requires any easing to be principled

[[The United States has a long history of
leveraging]{.underline}]{.mark} economic power and restrictive economic
measures to advance its national security objectives. It also has a
history of offering [[sanctions relief **as a bargaining
tool**]{.underline}]{.mark} in negotiations to achieve its desired end
states. Sanctions and the economic pain they inflict can effectively
bring an adversary to the negotiating table, and [[sanctions relief can
often get the adversary to agree to a deal.]{.underline}]{.mark}

After three years of increasingly restrictive sanctions targeting Russia
over its unlawful invasion of Ukraine, [[Russia is feeling the
pain]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its economic growth is minimal, and it has
retracted into a "wartime economy" that is driven by military spending
and government support. Annual inflation remains high, holding at 10
percent as of February. For comparison, a healthy inflation rate is
generally between 2 percent and 3 percent per year. The Central Bank of
the Russian Federation held interest rates at an all-time-high 21
percent in February. Russia is having trouble selling its oil as a
result of sanctions and the expiration of General License 8L earlier
this month, which makes it even more difficult to buy Russian oil
without risking exposure to secondary sanctions.

[[The sanctions are **working**, and Russia's economy is in a
downturn]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, despite Russian success in
driving Ukrainian forces out of most of Russia's Kursk region, Ukraine
is holding off Russian advances and inflicting serious casualties. In
short, [[the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}, its Group of Seven (G7)
partners, [[and Ukraine have the **upper hand** in
negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark} to end the war. They should use it.

As the Trump administration pursues a deal with Russian President
Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump must determine which US
sanctions should be eased or lifted and when that sanctions relief
should come as part of a negotiated peace settlement. [[To
**ensure**]{.underline}]{.mark} Trump can negotiate [[peace
from]{.underline}]{.mark} a position of [[strength]{.underline}]{.mark}
and to hold Putin accountable to his end of the deal, [[we offer
the]{.underline}]{.mark} following [[do's and don'ts of lifting US
sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} on Russia.

#### Sanctions relief undercuts Baltic deterrence

peril: Defence,\" No Publication,

[[A ceasefire in Ukraine will **dramatically increase** the security
threat to **Baltic** nations]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[Russia
will]{.underline}]{.mark} proceed with plans to [[**re-arm and
redeploy** troops to]{.underline}]{.mark} Nato\'s north-eastern flank,
the region\'s defence ministers have warned. [[Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania]{.underline}]{.mark}, which were annexed by the Soviet Union
before regaining independence in the 1990s, are worried that [[Moscow
**will not stop** at Ukraine once]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[brokers a
ceasefire]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Baltic nations point out that [[the
Kremlin has **already** laid out plans]{.underline}]{.mark} for
increased military production and additional troops along their borders.

\"We all understand that when the war in Ukraine will be stopped, Russia
will redistribute its forces very quickly,\" Estonian defence minister
Hanno Pevkur told the Financial Times. \"That means also the threat
level will increase significantly very quickly.\"

His Lithuanian counterpart, Dovile Šakaliene, made similar remarks while
in the UK last week. \"Let\'s not have any illusions. Let\'s not lie to
ourselves that Russia is going to be done after

Ukraine,\" she said. \"Russia will use this time following a ceasefire
to speed up its military capabilities. They already have a huge,
battlefield-trained army, which is going to get even bigger.\"

The Trump administration has led talks with both Russia and Ukraine on
ending the war, but a full ceasefire is still seen as far off. While
Kyiv agreed to an immediate cessation of hostilities in the Black Sea
and a US-backed 30-day ceasefire, [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} has so
far only pledged to pause attacks on energy infrastructure, saying it
[[would comply]{.underline}]{.mark} with the Black Sea deal [[**only
after** the west lifts]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
**[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

A halt in fighting would give Russia a chance to fulfil its 2022 plans
to raise a 1.5mn strong army and add an entire new army corps in the
north, doubling the number of troops near Finland and the Baltics.
Pevkur said [[of the]{.underline}]{.mark} 600,000 Russian
[[troops]{.underline}]{.mark} currently estimated [[in Ukraine,
**300,000**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} probably
[[be **redeployed**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

\"These men will not go back to different parts of Russia to harvest the
corn or do something else because the salary they are getting in the
army is like five to 10 times more than what they could get in their
home town.\"

Baltic countries are particularly worried about a large-scale military
exercise known as Zapad to be held close to their borders in Russia and
Belarus this autumn. Held every four years, the drills simulate a
conflict with Nato countries and include tens of thousands of troops,
tanks, aircraft and artillery.

Both ministers also warned against redeploying any Nato troops from
their countries to form a so-called European \"reassurance force\" to be
sent to postconflict Ukraine as a means to deter Russia from attacking
again. \"We cannot jeopardise the security of the eastern flank of
Nato,\" Pevkur said. \"We cannot fall into the trap that our forces are
somehow fixed in Ukraine and then we will have risks at our border.\"

Nato\'s eastern flank nations, including Poland and Romania, have said
they could not commit to deploying troops in Ukraine at the expense of
their own security. Estonia has also objected to plans by the UK to
redeploy to Ukraine British forces earmarked for [[Baltic
defence]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Lithuania is currently defended by a German brigade which is set to be
stationed on its soil in coming months, Latvia by a multinational force
led by Canada and Estonia by a British brigade which can be dispatched
from the UK on short notice.

\"We\'ve got just under 1,000 UK troops in Estonia at the moment,\"
British defence secretary John Healey said last week.

\"That consistent ironclad commitment to Estonia will continue, and it
will continue because Estonia and our [[troops]{.underline}]{.mark} \...
[[are on the **front line** of Nato]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

The NPR further asserts that:

"[Moscow]{.underline} **[threatens]{.underline}** and
exercises [[limited nuclear first use]{.underline}]{.mark}, suggesting a
mistaken expectation that coercive nuclear threats
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} limited first
use could paralyze the United States and NATO and thereby end
a conflict on terms favorable to Russia. Some in the United States refer
to this as Russia's **["escalate to
de-[escalate"]{.mark}]{.underline}**[ **[doctrine]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
"De-escalation" in this sense follows from Moscow's mistaken assumption
of Western capitulation on terms favorable to Moscow."8

Though the Russians seemingly refute the existence of this doctrine by
its American name at least, some sources assert that the policy
may actually have been developed in the late 1990s, when now-Russian
President Vladimir Putin was chairman of the Russian National Security
Council under President Boris Yeltsin.9

The idea behind escalate to deescalate is that Russia might employ one
tactical nuclear weapon (or more) during a conventional conflict with
NATO forces for the purposes of preventing a defeat, consolidating
territorial gains, or even freezing a conflict in place without the
prospect of further fighting.

Indeed, [because of]{.underline} [the large]{.underline}, **[nearly
[10:1]{.mark}]{.underline}**[ **[disparity]{.underline}** [between]{.underline}]{.mark} the number
of Russian and
U.S. [[tactical nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, Moscow may think a nuclear
response from NATO is not a credible threat due to
Russia's asymmetric advantage. Other factors may also play a role in
Russian calculations, including a perception that NATO's large
membership would have difficulty finding a political-military consensus
on an appropriate response, including a nuclear option.

An example of the potential use of this Russian nuclear doctrine [[in a
hypothetical scenario]{.underline}]{.mark} might be helpful here:

[Moscow]{.underline} **[attacks]{.underline}** one---or
all---of [[the]{.underline} [**Baltic States** with its conventional
forces to establish control]{.underline}]{.mark} over some, or all, of
these nations' territory, returning them to Russia's control as they
were in the Soviet era. Invoking Article V, [[NATO responds with
conventional]{.underline}]{.mark} forces to protect and restore the
sovereignty of these three allied states.

Concerned about the inferiority of its conventional forces in this fight
against the allied
powers, [[Moscow then contemplates]{.underline}]{.mark} exploding [[a low-yield tactical nuclear
weapon]{.underline}]{.mark} somewhere in theater [[as
a warning of]{.underline}]{.mark}
Russia's [[potential escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} from the
conventional to the nuclear domain of warfare, including the potential
future use of high-yield, strategic nuclear weapons.

In Moscow's eyes, perhaps NATO will become concerned about the possible
escalation of the fighting from the conventional to the
nuclear---especially Russia's potential use of more powerful nuclear
weapons against European and American cities. In response, NATO may
consider pausing its counteroffensive against Russian forces in the
Baltics.

Indeed, [[Moscow may misperceive]{.underline}]{.mark} that if [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} does not have
sufficient tactical nuclear weapon capabilities to respond in kind, it
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} be inclined to
[[seek de-escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than launch
a strategic nuclear weapon at Russia and risk moving further up the
escalation ladder---[[a response that could lead to **all-out nuclear
war**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

## UQ

### UQ -- Sanctions Are Solid

#### UQ -- Trump keeping Ukraine sanctions -- none lifted

Alex **Raufoglu, 7-1**-2025, \"Trump Quietly Extends Biden-Era Sanctions
Targeting Russian Banks, Energy Sector,\" Kyiv Post,
https://www.kyivpost.com/post/55461, (ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration last week [[quietly
extended]{.underline}]{.mark} significant [[Biden-era sanctions
targeting]{.underline}]{.mark} key [[Russian banks
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[energy]{.underline}]{.mark} sector, just
days before they were set to expire. A senior official insisted in an
interview with Kyiv Post that the current administration has not lifted
any sanctions on Moscow since taking office in January.

On June 27, the US Treasury Department issued General License No. 115B,
an order that temporarily sanctions thirteen of Russia's biggest banks,
including the very institutions that help fund Vladimir Putin's war
machine.

On January 10, 2025, just days before leaving office, former President
Joe Biden's administration announced sweeping measures targeting some
Russian companies, such as Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas, and others that
explore, produce, and sell oil.

Biden aides had briefed Trump aides on their sanctions, making a case
that the move would provide the White House leverage to reach a deal for
peace in Ukraine.

In the meantime, the Treasury Department's announcement last week --
which extends the Biden-era sanctions for another six month ---
triggered speculations on social media, amplified by Hungarian Foreign
Minister Péter Szijjártó who announced that the United States has lifted
sanctions that previously restricted the construction of the
Russian-built Paks II nuclear power plant in Hungary.

"[[**No sanctions** involving Russia have been lifted by the Trump
administration, **full stop**]{.mark}**,"**]{.underline} a senior Trump
Administration official told Kyiv Post's Washington correspondent.

When it comes to the Treasury Department's latest General License, "This
is not a lifting of any sanctions - it simply extends a general license
that was previously in place," explained Brad Brooks-Rubin, a former
senior adviser in the Office of Sanctions Coordination at the State
Department from 2022 to 2024.

"Obviously, if the Trump Administration had let the general license
expire, then that would have been a significant rollback," Brooks-Rubin,
who currently serves as a partner at Arktouros, a boutique law firm
specializing in sanctions, anti-money laundering, and regulatory advice,
told Kyiv Post.

For security assistance analysts such as Colby Badhwar from Tochnyi, a
research group, the Treasury Department's latest announcement is "a
routine action."

"The previous license expires today (on June 30, 2025) so the
administration had to make a decision to renew it or allow it to lapse,
and renewing it is the easiest decision to take," Badhwar told Kyiv
Post.

"[[It's]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[another example
of]{.underline}]{.mark} there being more [[**continuity** in policy
between]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Biden and Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
admins than is commonly assumed," he added. On Hungary specifically,
which is the main beneficiary of this decision, the Biden administration
"was more vocally critical of them, but that was not backed up by
significant action via sanctions," Badhwar recalled.

When it comes to the implications of the latest sanctions extension,
former Biden official Brooks-Rubin explained to Kyiv Post that [[it
reflects the current administration's **cautious**
approach]{.underline}]{.mark}, keeping options open without imposing new
significant restrictions.

#### UQ -- Sanction Regime Strong now

---

Ukraine's [[European allies say now is not the time for lifting
sanctions on Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a clear message to the
Trump administration as Moscow pushes Washington for concessions ahead
of signing a US brokered deal on ending the fighting in the Black Sea.

The leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Germany all affirmed at a
summit on Thursday that Europe will not lift sanctions on Russia -- a
strong and seemingly coordinated nod to the Trump administration, which
has said it is still evaluating the Kremlin's demands.

They spoke after a meeting of the so-called "coalition of the willing"
in Paris which discussed how to bolster support for Kyiv and what role
they might play if a peace deal is struck with Russia.

The Trump administration's willingness to embrace Moscow as he seeks a
quick end to the war against Ukraine, which has included vocal support
for key Russian demands even before talks had even begun, has alarmed
European allies.

While divisions remain among [[European leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}
about how to respond, they [[spoke in **unison** on Russia's demand to
**ease sanctions**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"(There is) complete clarity that [[now is **not the time** for lifting
of sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}," British Prime Minister Keir Starmer
said.

"Quite the contrary -- what [[we discussed]{.underline}]{.mark} is how
[[we can **increase sanctions** to support the **US initiative**, to
bring Russia to the table]{.underline}]{.mark} through further pressure
from this group of countries," the British Prime Minister said, still
striking a conciliatory tone toward the United States.

Starmer said the meeting involved more than 30 countries, including
Ukraine's European allies and NATO officials. He described the meeting
as "very constructive."

Echoing Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said stopping sanctions
would be a "serious mistake."

"[[It makes **no sense** to end the sanctions until peace **has actually
been achieved**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and unfortunately we are still a
long way from that, as you can see."

This week the US announced that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to end
fighting in the Black Sea. But Moscow soon followed up the statement by
saying it would only implement the deal once some of the sanctions
imposed on Russian banks and exports over its invasion of Ukraine are
lifted.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the United States
is "going to evaluate" Russia's conditions to agreeing to a Black Sea
partial ceasefire.

#### UQ -- Trump more likely to raise sanctions than reduce them

Amid Ongoing Fighting With Ukraine,\" RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty,
https://www.rferl.org/a/33464766.html, (ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

US President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} that his Russian counterpart Vladimir
[[Putin understands]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[more sanctions "may be
coming]{.underline}]{.mark}," as Moscow continues to reject Washington's
push for a cease-fire in Ukraine.

Speaking on Air Force One on July 4, Trump said: "You know, we talk
about sanctions a lot and he understands that it may be coming."

Trump\'s comments reflected the failure, so far, to broker a cease-fire
in the conflict and his apparent dissatisfaction with the Russian
leader.

Outgoing flights at Moscow\'s Sheremetyevo airport were temporarily
paused and Russia said it shot down four incoming Ukrainian drones
approaching the Russian capital.

Meanwhile, Ukraine\'s top general, Oleksandr Syrkiy, reported that he
had spent two days this week in the eastern Kharkiv region, where he
said Russia was preparing a new offensive.

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}'s remarks also
[[elaborated]{.underline}]{.mark} on his earlier comment [[that he was
"disappointed" by]{.underline}]{.mark} his phone call with
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} on July 3.

\"He wants to go all the way, just keep killing people, it\'s no good,\"
he said, adding that he was "very unhappy" with the Kremlin leader.

Hours earlier, Trump had what he called \"a good call\" with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy has repeatedly called on the United States to impose greater
sanctions on Russia to force Moscow to the negotiating table.

US Senator [[Lindsey Graham]{.underline}]{.mark}, a Republican and the
[[author of a bill to **strengthen** sanctions against
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, said he [[believes]{.underline}]{.mark}
President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} [[will
**support**]{.underline}]{.mark} and sign the legislation.

Speaking on ABC News, [[Graham said]{.underline}]{.mark} he discussed
the proposed measures with Trump on June 28.

"For the first time yesterday, [[President told
me]{.underline}]{.mark}... I was playing golf with him. He says, [[it\'s
time to move]{.underline}]{.mark} your bill. There\'s a waiver in the
bill, Mr. President. You\'re in charge of whether or not it\'s to be
implemented. But we\'re going [[to give]{.underline}]{.mark} President
Trump [[a tool in the toolbox]{.underline}]{.mark}," Graham said.

When asked whether Trump is going to sign it, Graham said, "Yeah, I
think we\'re in good shape."

The senator added that [the legislation is expected to be passed after
Congress returns]{.underline} from its July recess.

The bill [[includes a]{.underline}]{.mark} provision to impose a [[500%
tariff on countries that]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[purchase
goods from Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} while failing to support Ukraine.

"If you\'re buying products from Russia and you\'re not helping Ukraine,
then there\'s a 500% tariff on your products coming to the United
States. India and China buy 70% of Putin\'s oil. They keep his war
machine going. My bill has 84 co-sponsors. It would allow the president
to put tariffs on China and India and other countries to stop from
supporting Putin\'s war machine to get him to the \[negotiating\]
table," Graham said.

Earlier, it was reported that the US Senate has postponed consideration
of a new sanctions package targeting Russia, citing shifting priorities
due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also called for "more pressure"
and "more packages of sanctions" on Russia.

"[[All 31 votes today supported]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[there will
be **no lifting of any sanctions** against Russia until this war ends in
a just peace]{.underline}]{.mark}," Zelensky said in a press conference
from Paris.

Zelensky also called for unity amid Russian President Vladimir Putin's
desire to "divide Europe and America."

"We want America to be stronger. I agree with Emmanuel (Macron) that we
all need it. It's not even a matter of desire, but we need America to be
stronger in relation to Russia," the Ukrainian president said.

"[[Putin wants to]{.underline}]{.mark} negotiate over territory from a
stronger position. He's thinking only about war," Zelensky said earlier
in a social media post.

"They're dragging-out the talks and trying to [[get the US stuck in
endless]{.underline}]{.mark}, pointless [[discussions about fake
'conditions' just to buy time]{.underline}]{.mark} and then try to grab
more land," Zelensky added, highlighting that Ukrainian intelligence
indicates Russian forces are getting ready for new offensives against
the Sumy, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine.

Lifting individual sanctions can be a high-profile but substantively
less impactful early move. Continued [[vigilance on]{.underline}]{.mark}

(ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

In a joint statement issued by the White House, Secretary of State Marco
[[Rubio and Witkoff denied]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[discussions about
easing sanctions had taken place]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"This is false. [[Neither]{.underline}]{.mark} of us [[have had **any
conversations** about lifting sanctions on Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
as part of a peace deal with Ukraine," their statement said. "[[This is
just totally fictitious and irresponsible reporting from
Politico]{.underline}]{.mark}, a fifth-rate publication. If they have an
ounce of journalistic integrity they will fully retract this piece of
fiction."

One of the two Nord Stream 2 pipelines built to deliver gas via the
Baltic Sea to Germany is still operable despite a 2022 explosion that
destroyed one line, as well as the pair of pipelines that were part of
its companion, Nord Stream 1. The blast in September 2022 that halted
shipments of gas remains under investigation, though reports have linked
the explosion to Ukrainian nationals.

The Biden administration also placed sanctions on Russia's Arctic 2
liquefied natural gas project, which could deliver up to 13.2 million
tons of gas a year if those sanctions were lifted.

Trump criticized Nord Stream during his first term and on the campaign
trail. He attacked Biden for waiving sanctions on the project in 2021
before later reimposing them.

Witkoff and Rubio had been expected to participate in peace settlement
talks scheduled Wednesday in London but bailed at the last minute.
[[Included in the administration's settlement plan
was]{.underline}]{.mark} a recognition of Russia's illegal 2014
annexation of Crimea and a lifting of sanctions --- [[two things
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} said it [[**would not** agree

U.S. Secretary of State Marco [[Rubio]{.underline}]{.mark} has

[[Rubio dismissed as \"unequivocally false\" a Politico report that
Washington would reverse U.S. policy on Russia\'s Nord Stream

coup for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Steve [[Witkoff]{.underline}]{.mark}, an envoy for the Trump
administration, had floated the idea, according to the publication
citing undisclosed sources, although he [[also rejected the
report]{.underline}]{.mark}, which comes ahead of his meeting with Putin
in Moscow on Friday.

The publication reported how U.S. government figures believe Witkoff has
been misled by Moscow about the U.S. economic opportunity in restoring
business ties with Russia.

The Biden administration also sanctioned Russia\'s Arctic 2 liquefied
natural gas (LNG) project. Moscow regaining its status as Europe\'s top

In March, another Trump envoy, Richard Grenell, spoke with Russian
representatives in Switzerland about supplying Russian gas to Germany
through the pipeline, according to German newspaper Bild in a report
widely picked up by other media outlets.

However, Grenell has denied the German newspaper\'s claims as
\"completely false and made up\" and told Newsweek that he never went to
Switzerland for a Nord Stream meeting nor has he been involved in a Nord

The results of [[the sanctions had a strong negative impact on the

Russia's policy in the Ukrainian conflict because it depends on the

brought the necessary effect. The reverse side of the coin is that [[all

Arctic scientific cooperation

Scientific cooperation6 has been a hallmark of \'Arctic exceptionalism\'
for decades. However, [[since Russia\'s invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in February 2022
[[most]{.underline}]{.mark} of the [[avenues for scientific and research
cooperation between the Arctic 7 and Russia have been
curtailed]{.underline}]{.mark}. In particular, [[Russia\'s scientists
and researchers have been excluded from nearly all Arctic scientific
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} with their Western partners. This
exclusion happened through the suspension of activities involving Russia
[in the framework of the Northern Dimension policy, the BEAC and the
CBSS]{.underline}, following which Russia withdrew from the two latter
forums. Activities involving Russia within the AC have also been
suspended, with a gradual and limited resumption of scientific
cooperation at the working group level since the beginning of September
2023, when the guidelines on the partial resumption of the forum\'s
activities were approved. However, while the resumption of activities at
the technical level allow for the continuation of existing and the start
of new scientific projects, the cumbersome procedure of written
communication and practicalities, as well as the lack of impetus at the
political level, remain problematic.

In parallel, [[the Arctic 7 have each imposed sanctions regimes that
include the restrictions in]{.underline}]{.mark} the field of
[[scientific cooperation with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance,
Denmark, Sweden and Finland have enforced the EU sanctions against
Russia, which encompassed the suspension of all scientific collaboration
with Russian entities and the withdrawal of research funding from
activities that involve Russia.

Furthermore, while Western scientists in some instances could
collaborate with their Russian counterparts on a personal level in their
own capacity, Academia Europaea Bergen\'s Special Report explains that
such colla[[boration has become very difficult due to the real and
perceived obstacles on both sides]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the West,
many [[researchers have become cautious when connecting and
collaborating with Russian counterparts, as they often feared being
perceived as supporting (even if inadvertently) the Russian
government]{.underline}]{.mark}, which indeed funds most of the
country\'s research. The [[fear of negative
reactions]{.underline}]{.mark} or even repercussions from colleagues and
especially funding bodies, together with a fear of security threats,
[[has had a chilling effect on Western-Russian scientific cooperation in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition, the practical and
logistical difficulties arising from the sanctions regimes often lead to
difficulties or even make Western-Russian cooperation impossible.
Russian scientists also risk repercussions if their government deems
that they are working too closely with the West.

The imposition of [[comprehensive sanctions on
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} following its invasion of Ukraine has
[[profoundly impacted Moscow\'s strategic ambitions in the Arctic.
Historically regarded by Russia as a cornerstone for economic growth,
energy development, and military advantage, the Arctic region has become
increasingly challenging to exploit due to international restrictions.
Sanctions have targeted key sectors critical for Russia's Arctic
projects, including energy, finance, technology, and
shipping]{.underline}]{.mark}, resulting in delays, reduced foreign
investment, and technological isolation.

Politically, [[Russia's role in Arctic governance
forums]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the Arctic Council [[has been
significantly diminished, leading to]{.underline}]{.mark} its growing
[[diplomatic isolation]{.underline}]{.mark}. In response, Russia has
shifted toward bilateral partnerships and a more assertive territorial
posture, potentially escalating military tensions in the region.
Militarily, the increased risk of Arctic militarization could
destabilize regional security and provoke an arms race among Arctic
nations.

Additionally, the [[sanctions have severely constrained academic and
scientific cooperation in Arctic research]{.underline}]{.mark},
hindering international efforts to address [[climate change and
environmental management]{.underline}]{.mark}. The cumulative effects of
these sanctions suggest a long-term recalibration of Russia's Arctic
strategy, with broad implications for global energy markets, regional
security dynamics, and sustainable development in the High North. This
evolving situation underscores the need for new diplomatic, economic,
and environmental approaches to Arctic governance in a changing
geopolitical landscape.

Do [[go slow on lifting energy sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}, and don't

Trump has long appreciated the danger of reliance on Russian energy and
Nord Stream 2. The Europeans and even the Germans finally agree. [[The
United States]{.underline}]{.mark} and its allies [[should retain
restrictions on Russian energy]{.underline}]{.mark} exports [[sufficient
to]{.underline}]{.mark}:

keep the [[pressure on Russia to adhere to all elements of a Ukraine
deal]{.underline}]{.mark};

after that, [[maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} Europe's hard-won [[energy
independence]{.underline}]{.mark} from Russia, and

[[allow the United States to replace Russia]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially as a supplier of liquefied natural gas
([[LNG]{.underline}]{.mark}).

The United States should retain European markets, and Russia should
chase lower-value Asian markets with more expensive transportation legs.
The United States should maintain sanctions on the Russian oil and LNG
sectors, including oil field services and refining technology, until
late in the process. US negotiators determining when to lift
energy-related sanctions on Russia should consider Trump's strategy to
advance US energy dominance. Russia is an energy competitor to the
United States. The White House lift[[ing restrictions on Russian oil too
early or by too much could work against US plans for advancing energy
dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Impact of Sanctions on Russia\'s Arctic Strategy

The imposition of sanctions has complicated Russia\'s endeavours in the
Arctic. [[These sanctions have strained Russia\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}
economy and limited its [[access to crucial]{.underline}]{.mark} 3
[[technologies and international partnerships for developing its Arctic
projects. As international entities reassess their involvement in Arctic
collaborations with Russia, the country faces increasing challenges in
realizing its Arctic strategy. The withdrawal of foreign investment,
technology transfer, and diplomatic isolation significantly hampers
Russia's capacity to effectively utilize the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}'s resources and assert its regional
influence.

In conclusion, the sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its
actions in Ukraine have significantly affected its strategic and
economic plans in the Arctic. The comprehensive nature of these
sanctions, [[targeting various aspects of Russia\'s engagement in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, underscores the region\'s complexity and
interconnectedness of geopolitical dynamics. As Russia navigates these
challenges, [[the future of its Arctic strategy remains uncertain, with

5.3. Long-Term Implications for Global Understanding of the Arctic

The long-term implications of reduced international cooperation in
Arctic research are significant. [[A diminished collaborative effort can
lead to gaps in understanding the Arctic\'s **environmental** systems,
its role in **global climate** patterns, and the **sustainable

will have significant impacts on the financial, energy, and technology
sectors.

Further, [[the administration should engage with the private

Do [[hold the immobilized Russian assets **as surety** for Ukraine's

After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, [[G7 partners
immobilized nearly \$300 billion worth of Russian sovereign
assets]{.underline}]{.mark} held across multiple jurisdictions.
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} assets [[should **not** be returned to
Russia. The best option would be]{.underline}]{.mark} for Washington and
its allies [[to **confiscate** the assets for Ukraine's
reconstruction]{.underline}]{.mark} and further military support for
Ukraine. At a minimum, G7 countries should retain control over the
assets [[as **surety** for a Russian contribution to Ukrainian
reconstruction]{.underline}]{.mark} and adherence to the terms of a
cease-fire. The majority of the immobilized funds are held in Europe and
therefore the United States must continue to coordinate with Europe on
this issue. The interest generated by the immobilized assets is
currently providing the income stream repaying the fifty-billion-dollar
loan that the United States and Western allies provided to Ukraine in
late 2024. [[The United States and its Western allies would be **exposed
to liability** for the fifty billion dollars should the immobilized
funds be released]{.underline}]{.mark} and the principal given to
Russia.

The [[economic pressure and restrictive measures the United States and
its partners placed on Russia have given them the **upper
hand**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If Russia is ready to negotiate and make a
deal that secures Ukraine's future and safety, they should strategically
play their hand and consider the dos and don'ts of lifting sanctions.

## Impacts & Turns Case

### Causes Baltic Invasion

#### Reduced sanctions undermine Baltic security

Oleksandra **Opanasenko**, 3-30-20**25**, \"FT: Baltic states fear
possible ceasefire in Ukraine --- it would increase the threat from
Russia,\" No Publication,
https://babel.ua/en/news/116705-ft-baltic-states-fear-possible-ceasefire-in-ukraine-it-would-increase-the-threat-from-russia,
(ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

The [[Baltic states are concerned that a possible ceasefire in Ukraine
would sharply increase the threat to their
security]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it would give Moscow time to rearm and
move troops to their borders.

This is reported by the Financial Times.

The defense ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania believe that
Moscow will not stop in Ukraine after the Trump administration
negotiates a ceasefire. They note that the Kremlin has already publicly
announced plans to increase military production and deploy additional
troops along their borders.

\"We all understand that when the war in Ukraine ends, [[Russia will
very **quickly distribute** its forces]{.underline}]{.mark}. This means
that the threat level will increase rapidly and significantly,\" said
Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur.

Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Šakalenė agrees with Pevkur: \"We
should not have any illusions. Letʼs not fool ourselves that Russia will
stop at Ukraine. [[After the ceasefire, Russia will]{.underline}]{.mark}
use the time to [[**accelerate** the buildup of military
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. They already have a huge army with
combat experience, and it will only grow.\"

According to Pevkurʼs estimate, of the 600 000 Russian soldiers
currently in Ukraine, 300 000 will likely be redeployed.

"These people will not return to the regions of Russia to pick corn or
do anything else, because the salary they receive in the army is about
five to ten times higher than what they could receive in their
hometown," notes the Estonian Minister of Defense.

The Baltic states are particularly concerned about the large
Russian-Belarusian military exercises \"West\", which are held every
four years. They will take place this fall.

The Baltic defense ministers emphasize that the redeployment of any NATO
troops from their countries --- in particular to enforce the ceasefire
in Ukraine --- would jeopardize their own security, and warn against
this, objecting to such plans by the allies.

The US is negotiating with Russia and Ukraine to end the war, but a true
ceasefire is still in sight. Kyiv has already agreed to halt hostilities
in the Black Sea and not attack Russian energy facilities during a
30-day truce. [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}, in return, has only
promised not to attack energy facilities and [[said it would implement
agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} on the Black Sea [[only **after**
Western sanctions are lifted]{.underline}]{.mark}

Zelensky says calm at sea should start immediately after White House
statements. However, Russia puts forward conditionsZelensky says calm at
sea should start immediately after White House statements. However,
Russia puts forward conditions.

[[Even a **temporary pause** in hostilities would allow Russia to
implement its plans]{.underline}]{.mark} as early as 2022 --- to
increase the army to 1.5 million soldiers and create a new army corps in
the north, which would effectively double the number of troops near the
borders of Finland and the Baltic states.

#### Sanctions reductions fund the war machine

sanctions rumors: \"Unequivocally false\",\" Newsweek,

(ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

Why It Matters

The Nord Stream pipelines carried gas from Russia to Germany under the
Baltic Sea and were blown up in an apparent act of sabotage in late
2022, although one of the two [[Nord Stream 2]{.underline}]{.mark}
pipelines is still operable.

[[Sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} against companies participating in the
pipeline\'s construction [[were put in place during Trump\'s first
term]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Biden administration lifted some
restrictions in 2021 but reinstated them after Putin\'s full-scale
invasion in 2022 focused the minds of European governments to wean
themselves off Russian fossil fuels.

[[Easing sanctions would throw Russia a lifeline on rebooting its
dwindling gas revenues, which **fund its war
machine**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in March that Washington and
Moscow were in talks to revive the Nord Stream gas pipelines; this would
offer economic benefits for Russia if the EU agreed to resume imports of
the fuel.

To be sure, [[Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark} military is a shell of the
Red Army. But it pays to recall that his **[[military buildup and
outright aggression occurred as NATO members slashed military
spending]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[deemphasized]{.mark} their
[[all-for-one collective defense

and "hugged the bear,"]{.mark}]{.underline} [in the words of former NATO

history's [other]{.mark} revisionist [autocrats]{.mark}, [tries to
justify his actions by contriving external causes and claiming the high
road of self-defense]{.mark}. [He cites NATO's]{.mark} eastward
[expansion to explain]{.mark} [Russia's bellicose
turn]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The problem]{.mark} with Putin's version of
history [is that it doesn't correspond with
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the Brookings Institution's Steven
Pifer
[details](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/11/06-nato-no-promise-enlarge-gorbachev-pifer),
Mikhail Gorbachev "made clear there was no promise regarding broader
enlargement" as the Cold War thawed. [Gorbachev
himself](http://www.nato.int/cps/eu/natohq/topics_111767.htm) conceded,
"The topic of NATO expansion was not discussed at all." **[The alliance
didn't double-cross its way to the Russian border]{.underline}**.
Instead, **[NATO grew through a transparent process that allowed East
European nations to pursue membership on their own
volition]{.underline}**---and encouraged the sort of political reforms
that actually diminished tensions with post-Soviet, post-authoritarian
Russia. But Putin won't be confused by the facts---and [Putin's Russia
has reverted to authoritarianism.]{.underline}

**Guarantees war and aggression**

Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/08/11/no-more-resets-with-russia/>.
ZKMSU

Despite that record, [President Barack [Obama]{.mark} came into office
[hoping for a "reset]{.mark}" with Russia]{.underline}, [to the dismay
of Georgia]{.underline}, [whose territory remained
occupied]{.underline}, **[as well as U.S. allies in the Baltic
states]{.underline}**, [Poland, and the Czech Republic, who feared
further Russian aggression]{.underline}. The administration's decision
on Sept. 17, 2009---the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of
Poland in 1939---to seek greater cooperation with Russia by rewriting
U.S. missile defense plans further shocked Polish and Czech allies.
**[The [result]{.mark}?]{.underline}** By 2014,
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** had **[[illegally seized
Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark}** from Ukraine, [[started a war]{.mark} in
eastern Ukraine]{.underline}, [and [supported]{.mark} Syrian leader
Bashar [al-Assad]{.mark}'s chemical attacks on his own
people]{.underline}. Moscow later fudged a pledge to oversee the removal
of chemical weapons from Syria, [[increased spying on the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [attempted a coup in Montenegro]{.mark}, [buzzed U.S.
naval ships]{.mark} with fighter aircraft, [interfered in U.S.
elections]{.mark}]{.underline}, and attempted to murder the Russian
double agent Sergei Skripal with a chemical weapon in the United
Kingdom. [The Obama administration **imposed sanctions** on Russia
beginning in 2014. **[So much for a reset]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Like
his predecessors, and despite Russia's behavior, [[Trump]{.mark} has
also [sought to keep a hand outstretched]{.mark} to the
country]{.underline}. Like his predecessors, and despite Russia's
behavior, Trump has also sought to keep a hand outstretched to the
country. [Even at the risk of appearing to support accusations of
collusion with Russia, Trump has attempted to convey that the United
States is prepared for a better relationship if and when Russian
behavior improves. But in contrast to its predecessors, [the
admin]{.mark}istration has also [pushed back hard]{.mark} on Russia
[from the beginning]{.mark}]{.underline}---for example, [[**through
additional** sanctions;]{.underline}]{.mark} [lethal [arms assistance to
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[cuts to Russia's diplomatic
presence]{.mark} in the United States to reduce opportunities for
Russian espionage; [increased military exercises]{.mark} and training
with Georgia, Ukraine, and the Baltic states]{.underline}; [calling out
Russia's violations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; and
the [forward-positioning of]{.mark} some U.S. [forces in Poland and
Romania]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[But [Russian behavior has still not
changed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2020, [Russia's war in Ukraine
continues]{.underline}. The country still occupies part of Georgia, has
continued confrontations with the United States over Venezuela and
Syria, reportedly paid the Taliban to kill American soldiers, and
continues to try to interfere in elections in the United States and
Europe. Domestically, Putin has cracked down on opposition and the
media, and paved the way to extend his rule until at least 2036.
[Against this history of Russian aggression and despite multiple
attempts by U.S. administrations to work together]{.underline}, **[it is
therefore [stunning]{.mark} that]{.underline}**, as the United States
enters another presidential election, **[[arguments]{.mark} are again
[surfacing for yet another reset]{.mark} with Russia]{.underline}**, be
it in a second Trump term or a first term for Democratic candidate Joe
Biden. **[The [fundamental fallacy in such an argument]{.mark} is to
[believe]{.mark} that [U.S. policies drive Putin]{.mark}'s actions.
[They don't]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Authors of the open letter
argue that [[we must deal with Russia "as it is."]{.underline}]{.mark}
Indeed we must[. Russia "as it is" is [an increasingly authoritarian
state]{.mark} [determined to act aggressively against]{.mark} its
[neighbors]{.mark}, [extend its disruptive influence in the Middle East
and Asia, and]{.mark} strategically [weaken and divide]{.mark} Europe
and [NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} By the end of each of the last few U.S.
administrations, the presidents became convinced that pushing back
against Russia was essential. Rather than rethinking that stance at the
start of a new presidential term, **[[it is time to recognize]{.mark}
that [Russia is aggressive for its own reasons]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Instead of a reset, **[the West needs the patience to apply consistent
and steady pressure against Russian aggression]{.underline}**, [and to
support those in Russia and in neighboring states who seek freedom,
democracy, and security]{.underline}. **[For once, it is time for
Russia, not the West, to rethink its policy]{.underline}**.

### Baltics Escalate

**Russia will exploit the Baltics -- miscalc escalates**

Deterrence and the US Military Presence in Europe," Whitehall Papers
95:1, 26-41, <https://doi.org/10.1080/02681307.2019.1731207>. ZKMSU

[The legitimacy of President Vladimir [Putin's]{.mark}
regime]{.underline}, [which is strained]{.underline} by a stagnant
economy and rising popular dissatisfaction **[but is not likely to fall
soon]{.underline}**, [is underpinned by **the [narrative of
'encirclement]{.mark} of Russia by a hostile West'**]{.underline}. [This
[provides the pretext]{.mark} for Russia [to]{.mark} **[demonstrate its
power]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the world stage. As a result, [Moscow
will continue to assert its interests most boldly in its self-declared
sphere of influence in Eastern and North Central Europe, and may employ
force when it deems that necessary, or [when it sees a low-cost
opportunity]{.mark} to increase Russia's political or military
power]{.underline}. However, **[[Putin will avoid actions he believes
would provoke a major]{.mark} military [response]{.mark} from the US and
NATO, [which makes the]{.mark} Alliance's [deterrent posture]{.mark}
even more [crucial]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[If Putin questions the
credibility of NATO's deterrence because of]{.underline}]{.mark}
perceived military inadequacy or **[[Alliance
disunity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [a carefully calculated [military
incursion]{.mark} into NATO territory [is]{.mark} not
un[imaginable]{.mark}]{.underline}. A 2018 report by the RAND
Corporation found that [Russia has built up roughly 80,000 combat
personnel in the Western Military District and maintains significantly
more tanks, armoured fighting vehicles and heavy artillery in the
vicinity of the Baltic states than Allied forces]{.underline}.2 Given
the need for a credible deterrent posture, this current conventional
overmatch in North Central Europe, especially in the Baltic states,
remains a matter of serious concern for the Alliance. Meanwhile, **[the
[Kremlin will seek to exploit the perception that the West is
weak]{.mark}]{.underline}** and **[[divided by internal disputes]{.mark}
and differences between Washington and its European
allies]{.underline}**. [It will continue to [increase]{.mark} the
intensity, complexity and scope of its disinformation, [cyber
and]{.mark} other [hybrid activities]{.mark} aimed at [destabilising
Western societies]{.mark} and discrediting democratic
values]{.underline}. **[Russia will also likely continue to ignore its
international treaty obligations]{.underline}**, seeking to undermine
the security architecture set by the US and Europe, and to develop and
modernise its capabilities, [including the introduction of advanced
electronic, cyber and hypersonic technologies]{.underline}.3 The Kremlin
has already demonstrated a new focus on advancing high-precision strike
capabilities as part of what it terms 'pre-nuclear deterrence'. At the
same time, [Russia is expected to further modernise, if not increase,
its nuclear arsenal and to complete the re-nuclearisation of occupied
Crimea. [Russia's]{.mark} continued ambiguity regarding its doctrine and
'[escalate to de-escalate' strategy will]{.mark} force NATO to consider
the possibility that the Kremlin will [use]{.mark} asymmetric, or even
[nuclear]{.mark}, [capabilities to settle a conventional
conflict]{.mark} on its terms]{.underline}. [This has significant
implications for]{.underline} the US and [NATO]{.underline} in terms of
force posture and potentially strategy and doctrine. Signs indicate that
Russia will sustain its large-scale exercises, particularly the
strategic military exercises like Zapad 2017, Vostok 2018, and Tsentr
2019 that rotate yearly between Russia's geographic military districts.4
[Russia's armed forces are likely to increase the
complexity]{.underline} of these exercises, [maintaining and honing the
ability to rapidly mass and deploy conventional forces with little
warning]{.underline}. [This will enhance Russia's ability to prepare for
and execute potential offensive operations that could overwhelm forces
on NATO's borders]{.underline}, [increase the chances of Russia using a
snap exercise to disguise another illegal intervention]{.underline}
abroad (as Russia did in 2014 to hide its mobilisation before the launch
of its operation to occupy and annex Crimea), **[and raise the risks
that a [miscalc]{.mark}ulation by a NATO Ally or Russia [could escalate
to full-scale conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.5

An implementation of the **[strategies of
[restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [as well as offshore
balancing]{.underline}, **[[does not]{.mark} take into
[consider]{.mark}ation [that Russia]{.mark} still possesses and
apparently in the medium perspective [will possess sufficient
power]{.mark} in order [to fill a power vacuum]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[as it has been demonstrated by Russian policy in Ukraine, Georgia,
Syria, Libya and other places]{.underline} (Nye 2019). Furthermore, an
implementation of the paradigm of **[[retrenchment]{.mark} may [weaken
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[undermining]{.mark} its unity,
[coordination]{.mark} capabilities [and **power projection**]{.mark}
potential]{.underline}. Withdrawal of American forces from Europe,
especially during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Russian
occupation of Crimea may create a power vacuum in Eastern Europe and
[undermine the belief of Eastern members of NATO in US security
guarantees]{.underline}, [while without US support and ability to
lead]{.underline}, **[in the coming decade European countries will not
be able to balance Russia]{.underline}**. **[Retrenchment could be
[perceived by revisionist Russia as]{.mark} a sign of Western [weakness
and increase]{.mark} Russian [pressure on Eastern]{.mark} members of
[NATO]{.mark} and the EU as it seeks to gain a dominant position in the
region]{.underline}**. Moreover, according to the approach developed by
Glenn Snyder (1984) in his known article 'The Security Dilemma in
Alliance Politics', [implementation of the strategies of retrenchment
increases the risk that the members of NATO, especially the former
[members]{.mark} of the Eastern Block, the Baltic States and pro-Western
former Soviet republics like Ukraine and Georgia, [will fear being
abandoned]{.mark} by the USA]{.underline}. Consequently, [there will be
an increased [risk of]{.mark} distancing some of these countries from
the West or even lead to a [realignment]{.mark} with Russia, thus
undermining the existing European security and political
architecture]{.underline}. At the same time, Russia will be encouraged
to stay firm against the USA. Furthermore, **[US
[retrenchment]{.mark}]{.underline}** from Europe [and an unwillingness
to protect its allies may [compromise the belief in American power and
undermine]{.mark} the [cred]{.mark}ibility [of]{.mark} American security
obligations]{.underline}, **[the system of [alliances and treaties
worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [especially [in]{.mark} strategically
important East [Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially [[leading
to]{.mark} a [realignment with China]{.mark}]{.underline} of Eastern and
Southeastern countries of Asia. Also, [[in the ME]{.mark} this may lead
to a realignment of the region's countries [with Russia and
Iran]{.mark}, thus undermining US positions in a strategically important
region]{.underline} (De Maio 2019; Rathke 2016). On the other hand,
[currently Russia possesses a significant military potential, it may be
a threat to the Baltic States and other NATO/EU countries, and it
demonstrates a determination to use force]{.underline}. In the long
perspective Russia's power potential and the threat of a Russian
military intervention should not be overestimated due to the Russian
structural weaknesses mentioned above (Radin et al. 2019a; Campbell
2015). Thus, a significant deployment of American resources against
Russia, as supposed by the strategy of primacy, which demands
significant investment in military, enlargement of NATO and
infrastructural build-up in the long run, may be excessive, while
diverting the necessary resources from East Asia and pushing Russia into
close cooperation with China (McFaul 2018). Overall, the goals of a GS
of primacy are to make unipolarity permanent, strive to achieve an
unrivaled military dominance and encourage the spread of democratic
forms of government (this including a democratization of Russia), when
necessary by force, while preventing a rise of any significant hostile
power (Brands 2016: 327- 329). This can be seen as excessive and demand
too many resources. The post-9/11 experience demonstrates that a
promotion of liberal democracy and a nation built in shattered foreign
societies that never knew democracy before are beyond US's capabilities.
Moreover, this may lead to an overstretch as was demonstrated by the
Iraqi and Afghanistan examples (Brands 2016: 358,362; Brooks and
Wohlforth 2016: 119). Therefore, [it can be assumed that the logic of
**[the s]{.mark}tatus-[quo]{.mark} paradigm**, particularly of the
modest form of deep engagement, is the [most cost-effective]{.mark} GS
directed at protecting US fundamental national interests]{.underline}.
[The major purpose of this defensive GS is to maintain favorable
balances, preferably through alliances]{.underline} (which can be
defined as institutions helping to [solve "collective action
problems")]{.underline} and limited forward deployment in Europe, East
Asia and the ME (especially in the Persian Gulf), [maintaining security
commitments to partners and allies]{.underline}, **[while [preventing a
power vacuum]{.mark} and deterring an emergence of undesirable changes
to the status-quo]{.underline}**, [thus enabling the shaping of the
global environment and advance the grand strategy's three core
objectives]{.underline}. At the same time, this GS recognizes that the
USA is unable to solve every problem and should address those issues
which may undermine key American interests and global stability (Brooks
and Wohlforth 2016: 75,78,90,93,98). [Considering resurgent Russia, the
main goal of the modest deep engagement GS is to [balance Russia
through]{.mark} the maximization of [cooperation with]{.mark} close
allies, [NATO]{.mark} and the EU, and at the same time to [avoid]{.mark}
an [inadvertent escalation]{.mark} with Russia. Thus, according to this
GS, NATO is expected to remain the leading Western security structure in
Europe [providing]{.mark} coordination between the member states and a
[collective response]{.mark} to potential threats]{.underline}.

annexing part of another country, This behavior isn\'t generally viewed
as good neighborliness, either. Yet NATO isn\'t entirely averse to
mucking things up. The alliance has almost 10,000 troops in countries
that border Russia, while a two-week war game featuring thousands of
personnel and 50 aircrafts is being held in Scotland right now. The
enemy state in such rehearsals is often given a somewhat unambiguous

A second person said that while Witkoff has raised [[the idea of lifting
energy-related sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}, the idea so far has not
found much traction in the White House and that Rubio has tried to
derail it. "This is not a cake in the oven being baked, though the
ingredients are being assembled," this person said.

Among the people against the idea are Rubio and Interior Secretary Doug
Burgum, who is also head of the White House Energy Dominance Council,
people familiar with the debate said. Some in the U.S. government think
that Witkoff has been misled by Russia about the extent of the economic
opportunity for the U.S. in restoring business ties with Russia,
according to another person familiar with the matter.

"There is an internal White House debate between the energy dominance
people --- Burgum, who wants markets for U.S. LNG --- and Witkoff, who
wants to be closer to Russia," one of the people told POLITICO. Russia
regaining its status as Europe's top energy supplier would be "a
bloodbath for American \[oil and gas\] producers," this person
continued.

The State Department did not respond to questions. The Interior
Department did not reply to an email with questions for Burgum.

Allowing Russia to resume shipments of gas via Nord Stream 2 or Arctic 2
LNG would [[depress global gas prices and put U.S. LNG

(ermo-sms,acc 7-7-2025)

Curbing nuclear threats

Unfortunately, the international community has very little power to
prevent the use of nuclear threats. Although the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) does formally ban nuclear threat
making, neither Russia nor any other nuclear country has joined the
agreement. There are otherwise no explicit laws and very [few
norms]{.underline} that could be leveraged to [restrain
Russia]{.underline}, North Korea, or even the United States from
bombastic nuclear threat making.

Some might argue that the best response, in that case, is to double down
on the actions that provoked Russia's nuclear threats, thereby showing
leaders of nuclear states---and states that may want nuclear
weapons---that this strategy does not achieve the desired results. My
research, however, implies otherwise. Nuclear bombast often precedes
provocative actions---but that chain reaction can be stopped if the
threat that the messenger faces recedes. On the other
hand, [if]{.underline} the threatening [rhetoric is
ignored]{.underline} [or even flouted,]{.underline} **[insecurity will
stew]{.underline}** until it bubbles over in some act of aggression.
Consider, for example, North Korea's threats calling for U.S.--South
Korean military exercises to cease. Scaling up these exercises to show
North Korea that its bullying will have consequences might sound like a
satisfying strategy, but it is one that will most likely further ratchet
up tensions by encouraging a reciprocal act of hostility. Quietly
continuing the exercises as planned---or even slightly scaling them
down---could avoid this trap. Unfortunately, [managing a tense threat
environment is a]{.underline} **[delicate balancing act]{.underline}**.
Cancelling exercises altogether would hardly be a solution, either, lest
it embolden North Korea (while sparking other problems for the
U.S.-South Korean alliance).

[If]{.underline} nuclear [threats]{.underline} are not simply "cheap
talk" but, instead[,]{.underline} [convey real
meaning]{.underline} about a messenger's concerns and willingness to
take risks[,]{.underline} then [forcefully resisting]{.underline} those
threats is a strategy
that [deserves]{.underline} careful [consideration]{.underline} in light
of the potentially catastrophic costs. When Russian officials issue a
new nuclear threat, it is important to assess the threat's
plausibility. My research suggests [[threats are most credible when
repeated and when they are linked to **specific conditions** (such as
on-the-ground behaviors in the Russo-Ukrainian
war]{.underline}]{.mark}). Conversely, one-off threats or threats about
linked issues (such as NATO membership or broader policies) should be
less critical.

Even caught between a rock and a hard place, [the
international]{.underline} [community
can]{.underline} [still]{.underline} take action to [make it
clear]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [threatening nuclear rhetoric
should stay just that:]{.underline} rhetoric[.]{.underline} [Moscow
ought to be certain that any use]{.underline} of nuclear weapons [will
not]{.underline}, in any way, [be tolerated]{.underline}. If such a
tragedy happens, it must be met with immediate, resounding, global
condemnation, as well as a laundry list of accompanying [punishments,
from]{.underline} **[even more
sanctions]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [Russian]{.underline} [exclusion
from international regimes]{.underline}. Here, too, there are lessons to
be drawn from North Korea. [[Moscow ought to know]{.underline}]{.mark},
without a doubt, that [[nuclear use would make]{.mark} it a pariah
state]{.underline}, adding one more item to the list of its similarities
with Pyongyang. After all, it is in the interest of all that Russia
remember its vital pledge: that "nuclear war cannot be won and must
never be fought."

### Thumpers (Trump weak on Ukraine now)

#### Thump -- Withholding air defense from Ukraine

Ray **Furlong**, **7-5**-2025, \"Trump Hints At New Sanctions On Russia
Amid Ongoing Fighting With Ukraine,\" RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty,
https://www.rferl.org/a/33464766.html, (ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

Since taking the office, [[Trump has not imposed any new sanctions on
Russia. His administration has also relaxed enforcement, experts
say]{.underline}]{.mark}. Trump has countered that imposing sanctions on
Russia would hurt peace negotiations.

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} also confirmed that he [[and Zelenskyy had
spoken]{.underline}]{.mark} about air defense, a key issue in Ukraine as
Russia has massively stepped up its aerial bombardment of Kyiv and other
cities this year.

The two men spoke following a huge drone and missile assault overnight
from July 3-4 that Kyiv said was the largest of the war so far.

[[Their conversation also followed a recent US decision to halt some
weapons supplies to Ukraine, which include Patriot air defense
missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} according to US media reports.

"The Patriot missile system is absolutely valuable, and to take that
away is a huge problem for Ukraine," US-based analyst Kervin Aucoin told
RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service.

"[[The removal of this aid]{.underline}]{.mark} by the United States to
Ukraine, it [[has emboldened the Russians]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is
emboldening Vladimir Putin to attack more areas within Ukraine," added
Aucoin, who was formerly an intelligence analyst in the US military.

Zelenskyy indicated that he had raised this with Trump.

\"We discussed the possibilities of air defense and agreed that we will
work on increasing the protection of the sky.\"

He added that they had agreed "a corresponding meeting of our teams.\"

Also on July 4, Trump discussed Patriot missiles in a call with German
Chancellor Friedrich Merz, one of a series of conversations he had with
Western leaders on US Independence Day.

Berlin has raised the possibility that it would buy Patriots from
Washington and then provide them to Kyiv.

#### Thump -- Trump soft on Russia over Ukraine now

Ellen **Mitchell**, **7-3**-2025, \"Senate Democrats launch
investigation into Trump's pause of Russia sanctions,\" Hill,
https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5384194-democrats-investigate-trump-russia-sanctions/,
(ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

[[Three Democratic senators]{.underline}]{.mark} said Thursday they
[[were launching an investigation into the Trump
administration's]{.underline}]{.mark} more than [[five-month pause on
new sanctions against Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} related to its war in
Ukraine.

"Instead of taking clearly available steps to pressure the aggressors,
President [[Trump is doing nothing and]{.underline}]{.mark} we will be
investigating this missed opportunity to push for an end to this war,"
Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Chris Coons
(Del.), said in a joint statement.

Since President Trump began his second term in January, the United
States has not issued any new sanctions against Russia stemming from its
invasion of Ukraine --- [[in some cases even **easing such
restrictions**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Under former President [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}, Washington
[[imposed]{.underline}]{.mark} more than [[6,200
sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} against entities linked to Moscow
targeting companies, trade and financial transactions that fuel its war
machine --- equalling more than 170 new sanctions a month, on average,
according to an analysis from The New York Times.

The lack of new sanctions, the lawmakers write, is only allowing Russian
President Vladimir Putin to continue his attack on Ukraine, even as
Trump has repeatedly stated he will quickly bring an end to the war.

"Americans should be asking why a president who says he wants to end a
major war is instead letting the aggressor run rampant," they wrote.

"[[On top of halting key assistance to Ukraine, President Trump has
blocked regular updates to our sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} and export
controls for five months and counting --- [[enabling a growing wave of
evaders in China]{.underline}]{.mark} and around the world to continue
supplying Russia's war machine."

[[The failure to use such existing tools "emboldens
Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} to keep fighting," they add.

The investigation comes as the Pentagon last month ordered a pause on
some air defense interceptors and precision-guided munitions to Ukraine,
a revelation that came to light this week.

Top Democrats --- including Shaheen, the ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee --- were quick to blast the reports of a
weapons halt.

House Armed Services Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.)
admonished the administration for leaving Congress out of the loop and
[[potentially jeopardizing U.S. national security]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Thump -- Leverage and Shell Companies

Aaron **Krolik**, **7-2**-2025, \"Lack of New U.S. Sanctions Allows
Restricted Goods and Funds Into Russia,\" No Publication,
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/politics/trump-russia-sanctions.html,
(ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

[[Since]{.underline}]{.mark} President [[Trump returned to office in
January, the United States has issued **no new sanctions** against
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} related to the full-scale invasion of
Ukraine. In some cases, the administration has eased restrictions. And
without new ones, analysts say, existing measures lose their force.

The result has created an opening for new dummy companies to funnel
funds and critical components to Russia, including computer chips and
military equipment that would otherwise be cut off to the Kremlin, trade
and corporate records show.

[[Sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} became the center point of the
Western-led effort to isolate the country after it invaded Ukraine in
2022. The effort [[evolved into an international game of cat-and-mouse,
as evasion schemes regularly sprang up]{.underline}]{.mark} around the
world.

During his presidency, Joseph R. [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} Jr.
[[imposed thousands of so-called maintenance sanctions targeting new
schemes. But this year, those actions have come to a
standstill]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to a New York Times analysis
of restrictions on trade, financial transactions and other activities
connected to Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin.

"[[Trump's approach to economic statecraft is to impose pressure and get
leverage]{.underline}]{.mark} and try to get the best deal possible,"
said Edward Fishman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global
Energy Policy at Columbia University. "[[For whatever reason, with
Russia, he **doesn't want to have any leverage** over
Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}."

The Biden administration placed, on average, over 170 new sanctions a
month on entities linked to Russia from 2022 to 2024. The targets
included oil and weapons production, tech procurement and banking.

In total, the Biden administration imposed more than 6,200 blocks on
individuals, companies, vessels and aircraft linked to Russia. In Mr.
Biden's final weeks in office, the United States ramped up pressure even
further, issuing nearly three times the monthly average, according to a
Times analysis of data from the Treasury Department.

[[The effects of]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[pressure are already
beginning to erode]{.underline}]{.mark}. A Times review of trade
records, online listings and corporate filings identified more than
[[130 companies in mainland China and Hong Kong]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[are advertising immediate sales of restricted computer chips to
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. None of the companies is under sanctions.

If one company is targeted with restrictions, [[many others are ready to
take its place]{.underline}]{.mark}.

One of these firms, HK GST Limited, advertises chips essential to
Russian cruise missiles, including the Kh-101, which was recently used
in a strike on Kyiv that killed 10 civilians. The firm was incorporated
in Hong Kong nine months ago, and its website was set up in February. An
analysis of website hosting data, domain ownership, code patterns and
contact details links the company to a network of four similar
electronics distributors, including Singaporean-based ChipsX and Carbon
Fiber Global, a high-performance drone part manufacturer based in China.
[[All of these companies were set up within the last three
years]{.underline}]{.mark}.

were removed only from the so-called Syrian sanctions
regime]{.underline}, according to a post by Vladyslav Vlasiuk, an
Advisor and Presidential Commissioner for Sanctions Policy, and a
statement by Member of Ukrainian Parliament Oleksii Honcharenko.

Vlasiuk recalled that the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), in
accordance with Trump\'s executive order dated June 30, 2025, removed a
number of Russian entities from the sanctions lists. All of them had
been sanctioned for supporting the regime of Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad.

According to Vlasiuk, the following were removed from the sanctions
list:

> OTKRYTOE AKTSIONERNOE OBSHCHESTVO MOSKOVSKI AKTSIONERNY BANK TEMPBANK;
>
> Russian Financial Alliance Bank;
>
> Hudsotrade Limited;

\"As for other Russian companies (Global Vision Group, STG Logistic,
Maritime Assistance LLC, MB Bank, Promsyrioimport, Rosoboroneksport OAO,
Russian Financial Corporation, etc.), designations in the SDN List were
adjusted, but US blocking sanctions against them remain in effect. US
sanctions against Russia for the war in Ukraine have not been lifted,\"
Vlasiuk explained.

MP Honcharenko reminded that Rosoboroneksport in particular had been
subject to three sanctions regimes -- Syrian, Iranian, and Russian (the
latter for the invasion of Ukraine). Trump\'s executive order removed
only the Syrian designation; the others remain in force.

\"The same applies to other companies. Russian banks also remain
blocked. The \[SYRIA\] designation was removed from the SDN (Specially
Designated Nationals & Blocked Persons List) and the SSI (Sectoral
Sanctions Identifications List), but the \[RUSSIA\] and \[IRAN\] tags
were not canceled,\" the MP added.

Lifting sanctions on Syria: What is known

On June 30, Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions against
Syria that had been in place since 2004. The decision was welcomed in
Syria, where officials stated that it would contribute to the country\'s
recovery and development following years of civil war.

However, [[according to media reports, Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"threw the baby out with the bathwater.\" Journalists noted that he
\"[[accidentally\" removed some Russian institutions, banks, and

Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter [[Szijjártó announced that the United
States has lifted sanctions that previously
restricted]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[construction of the Russian-built
Paks II nuclear power plant in Hungary]{.underline}]{.mark}.

According to Szijjártó, the sanctions were originally introduced under
the administration of former US President Joe Biden and had complicated
Hungary's long-term energy plans.

In a statement published on June 29, Szijjártó credited current US
President Donald Trump for reversing the measures, calling the decision
a step toward ensuring Hungary's future energy security.

"In light of the fact that [[there is now a
president]{.underline}]{.mark} in Washington [[who considers Hungary a
friend]{.underline}]{.mark}, the American government has lifted
sanctions related to investments in the Paks nuclear power plant,"
Szijjártó said.

The Paks nuclear power plant is Hungary's only nuclear facility, located
about 100 kilometers south of Budapest. It currently operates four
Soviet-designed VVER-440 reactors, commissioned between 1982 and 1987,
and generates over 40% of the country's electricity.

The Paks II expansion project---overseen by Russia's state nuclear
corporation Rosatom---includes the construction of two additional
VVER-1200 reactors.

The contract for the project was signed in 2014, shortly after Russia's
annexation of Crimea. The majority of the financing comes from a Russian
state loan.

[[Despite Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Hungary has
maintained its commitment to the project]{.underline}]{.mark}. In August
2022, the Hungarian government issued a construction permit for Paks II,
and in 2023, Rosatom CEO Alexey Likhachev visited Budapest to discuss
further steps with Hungarian officials.

Hungary has consistently opposed efforts within the European Union to
impose sanctions on Russia's nuclear sector.

Earlier, on March 11, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó
condemned a Ukrainian drone strike on the Druzhba pipeline as an "attack
on Hungary's sovereignty," after the incident forced a temporary halt in
Russian oil deliveries. He warned the strike posed a direct threat to
Hungary's energy security.

### NU -- Trump WILL drop sanctions

#### Thump -- regime collapses without NEW sanctions

Three Democratic Senators have launched an investigation into U.S.
President Donald Trump\'s refusal to impose new sanctions against
Russia, the legislators announced in a joint statement on July 3.

Since taking office in January, Trump has passed no new sanctions
against Moscow. In some cases, he has even eased restrictions, even as
Russia intensifies its full-scale war against Ukraine.

Senate Democrats Jeanne Shaheen, Elizabeth Warren, and Chris Coons
called on the administration to impose new penalties on the Kremlin and
said they planned to investigate Trump\'s \"five-month pause\" on
sanctions.

\"Americans should be asking why a president who says he wants to end a
major war is instead letting the aggressor run rampant,\" the senators
said in a joint statement issued July 3.

The statement followed an analysis by the New York Times (NYT),
published July 2, which found that [[Washington\'s slowed momentum on
sanctions created more opportunities for shell companies to funnel
sanctioned goods into Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Former U.S. President Joe Biden imposed an average of 170 new sanctions
per month on entities tied to Moscow between 2022-2024, according to the
NYT. Overall, the Biden administration slapped 6,200 penalties on
individuals, businesses, ships, and aircraft connected to Russia.

[[Without new sanctions to maintain pressure on Moscow, the effects of
the Biden sanctions regime have **begun to erode**]{.underline}]{.mark},
the NYT reported. An analysis of trade records and other data. showed
that over 130 companies in China and Hong Kong are advertising sales of
sanctioned computer chips to Russia. Despite this illegal activity, none
of the companies have been sanctioned.

\"On top of halting key assistance to Ukraine, President Trump has
blocked regular updates to our sanctions and export controls for five
months and counting---enabling a growing wave of evaders in China and
around the world to continue supplying Russia\'s war machine,\" Senators
Shaheen, Warren, and Coons said in their statement.

[[The senators called on Trump to \"**actively enforce** the existing
sanctions against Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}\" and urged the
administration to partner with EU and G7 nations to mount pressure on
Moscow.

\"Instead of taking clearly available steps to pressure the aggressors,
President Trump is doing nothing and we will be investigating this
missed opportunity to push for an end to this war,\" they said.

Along with letting U.S. sanctions on the Kremlin go stagnant, the Trump
administration has removed sanctions on Karina Rotenberg, the wife of a
key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and notably exempted
Russia from its sweeping \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.

(ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

A majority of [[Europeans would oppose]{.underline}]{.mark} following
the U.S.\' lead [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} President Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} pushed Ukraine to cede territories or
[[lifted sanctions on Russia as part of a peace
agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}, a new poll published on June 23 has
found.

Despite the self-imposed deadline of 100 days to end the war in Ukraine,
Trump is now 155 days into his presidency and Russian attacks have only
escalated.

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has still yet to take any concrete steps to
pressure Moscow into ending its war but [[has floated several
concessions that]{.underline}]{.mark} Ukraine could be forced to make
[[including ceding territory]{.underline}]{.mark}, while at the same
time announcing no new military aid packages for Kyiv.

The survey, conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations,
found that [[even in countries with pro-Russian governments like
Hungary, more people opposed the idea than supported
it]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Respondents in 12 countries (Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary,
Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and the U.K.) were
asked about three scenarios --- the U.S. pushing Ukraine to cede
territory, lifting sanctions on Russia, and withdrawing all military
support.

Majorities in all countries opposed their own governments following the
U.S. lead except for Hungary in the case of withdrawing all military
support.

Opposition was highest in Denmark, the U.K., Poland, Spain and Portugal,
and lowest in Hungary, Romania and Italy.

\"A benevolent interpretation is that [[Europeans]{.underline}]{.mark}
support an autonomous European policy to support Ukraine and they
[[don't want to]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~blindly~~ [[follow Trump's
lead]{.underline}]{.mark},\" the report\'s authors said.

\"But another reading of that data is that Europeans want Ukrainians to
continue fighting on their behalf.\"

#### Thump -- Nord Stream 2

**POLITICO**, 4-23-20**25**, \"White House debates lifting sanctions on
Russian energy assets, Nord Stream,\"

(ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

[[The White House is debating whether to lift sanctions on Russia's Nord
Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and potentially other Russian assets in
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} as part of discussions on ending the war
between Russia and Ukraine, five people familiar with the discussions
told POLITICO.

[[Lifting the sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} currently in place on one
of Russia's main pipelines connecting its natural gas fields to western
Europe [[would be a **sharp** **reversal** in the U.S.
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} first put in place during President Donald
Trump's first term. President Joe [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} waived
those sanctions early in his term, but [[**reimposed** them
after]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the
invasion of [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2022.

[[Restarting Nord Stream 2 could provide a financial windfall to
Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}, but only if the EU agreed to accept buying
Russian gas via the pipeline again --- a prospect that seems unlikely
given the EU's campaign to wean itself off Russian energy imports. But
lifting the sanctions would amount to a diplomatic coup for Russia and a
major concession from Trump.

White House special envoy Steve [[Witkoff]{.underline}]{.mark} has been
the main proponent of lifting sanctions, people familiar with the talks
told POLITICO. Witkoff, who has said he [[has developed a friendship
with Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} in his role as Trump's envoy to Moscow,
has [[directed his team to draw up a list of all of the energy
sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} that the United States has placed on
Russia as part of the effort, two people familiar with the matter said.

#### NU - Witkoff proposal

Anna **Fratsyvir**, **7-6**-2025, \"Trump envoy Steve Witkoff pushing to

(ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

U.S. President Donald [[Trump\'s Special Envoy]{.underline}]{.mark}
Steve [[Witkoff is pushing to lift U.S. energy sanctions on
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, Politico reported on July 4, citing two
people familiar with the matter.

The move is part of a broader debate within Trump\'s administration over
how to engage with Moscow amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.

While Witkoff is reportedly advocating for the easing of energy
sanctions, others in the administration disagree. Interior Secretary
Doug Burgum favors reducing U.S. reliance on Russian imports rather than
expanding trade, according to Politico.

Despite pledging during his campaign to end the war in Ukraine in \"24
hours,\" Trump has made little progress on securing a ceasefire. After
nearly seven months of his presidency, and several peace talks between
Russia, Ukraine, and the United States, no ceasefire agreement has been
reached.

Moscow continues intensifying its attacks against Ukrainian cities.
Russia launched one of the largest aerial attacks on Ukraine on July 4,
hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin had a phone conversation
with Trump.

When journalists asked if he had made any progress with Putin on the
call, Trump responded: \"No, I didn\'t make any progress with him today
at all.\"

Europe\'s energy sector is a central issue in the debate. According to
Politico, [[Moscow is in early talks with Washington about potentially
restarting the Nord Stream pipeline project]{.underline}]{.mark}, with
backing from U.S. investors. The development has sparked concern in
Brussels.

One senior EU official reportedly warned that [[Trump and Putin appear
to be aiming to \"divide the European energy market and create
(separate) spheres of influence]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

Witkoff, a real estate developer-turned-envoy, has raised eyebrows in
Washington and abroad over his handling of high-level talks with Russia.
As reported by NBC News in May, he has relied on Kremlin-provided
translators during multiple meetings with Putin, including a visit to
Moscow on April 26, just a day after a Russian missile attack killed 12
people in Kyiv.

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s administration [[has so far refrained
from imposing new sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} against Russia, [[even
as Putin continues to reject calls for a ceasefire]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### No internal link

#### AFF No Int Link -- EU can block SWIFT sanction lifting

Do develop a plan for gradually easing financial restrictions and
Russia's reentry into SWIFT and the global financial system

Include measurable and verifiable benchmarks connected to cease-fire
terms. At a minimum, this includes returning Ukrainian children to their
Ukrainian families, releasing prisoners of war, halting overt or covert
attacks against Ukraine and its allies, and establishing benchmarks to
disconnect Russian payment systems and channels from sanctioned regimes
such as Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, and China.

As we have discussed in our analysis of the Axis of Evasion, Russia is
working with China, Iran, North Korea, and other US adversaries to
generate revenue, move funds across borders, and develop alternative
payment systems. If Russia is to fully reengage in the US-led global
financial system, then it must financially detach itself from these
alternative payment systems and regimes sanctioned by the United States.
Easing restrictions on access to Western financial systems, investment,
and lending is a high-impact concession that should be left until late
in the process, only after Russia has demonstrated its commitments to
the outlined terms.

[[Reconnecting Russia with]{.underline}]{.mark} the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, known as
[[SWIFT]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[will require the removal of European
Union (EU) sanctions on Russian banks. SWIFT is headquartered in
Brussels, within EU jurisdiction, and it must comply with
EU]{.underline}]{.mark} laws and [[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[For
the United States to gradually ease financial restrictions, and for
Russia to reenter SWIFT]{.underline}]{.mark} and reestablish
corresponding banking relationships, [[the EU will need to be

Cooperation is imperative during the present moment of dislocation and
danger across the international community. But [[using **current
crises** as a **pretext** to]{.mark} **fundamentally [reset
relations]{.mark}** [is **short-sighted**; **it** ]{.mark}**also
[won't]{.mark} likely [work]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [There has been no

Even if Moscow's
[shipment](https://thehill.com/policy/international/490820-us-welcomes-russian-delivery-of-medical-supplies-to-new-york)
of medical materials to the U.S. was a symbol of goodwill and not just a
propaganda play, it at least represented a "misguided attempt to use the
crisis as some kind of a factor that allows you to clean the slate in
the relationship," as a senior analyst in Russia
[characterized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VUFRhy4tWE&feature=youtu.be&t=1845)
it. [We need to find ways to build confidence in the
relationship]{.underline}, **[but they need to be embedded in a broader
strategy]{.underline}**. And rather than resets, any goodwill
accumulated through the current crises should be channeled into
discreet, achievable policy goals. Considering Putin's interest in
nuclear policy issues and U.S. concerns about Russia's threat to allies
in Europe, arms control is a natural starting point for such a
rapprochement. However, three main challenges hinder any headway and
must be somehow addressed if progress is to be made. First, the Trump
administration is demanding that any future agreement on strategic arms
control (or even intermediate forces) include China. This is because the
U.S. does not want to be hamstrung by an agreement that could be
detrimental to its strategy in Asia. Beijing has repeatedly rejected
such invitations, effectively stalling serious arms control discussions
between Moscow and Washington as well. Moreover, Moscow does not want to
push Beijing on the topic either. As the expiration of New START looms,
this key agreement fostering transparency and limiting the number of
strategic nuclear weapons in the U.S. and Russia is likely to end,
absent new life in the discussion. Second, the U.S. is broadly
exhibiting a healthy dose of skepticism about these types of agreements
with Moscow, catalyzed by a lack of trust that Russia will comply.
Moscow's consistent disregard for the existing agreements that underpin
Euro-Atlantic security (e.g., the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe, the Budapest Memorandum and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty) makes it seem unlikely that Russia will abide by a new
agreement. Lastly, as U.S.-Russia relations further deteriorate, the
nuclear domain has become yet another area for confrontation. Rather
than strategic stability being a point of convergence --- as it once was
--- it is increasingly becoming a space for saber-rattling and conflict.
Moscow's vibrato around hypersonics is a good example. And the U.S. is
aggressively pushing back. The 2018 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review outlined
plans to develop and deploy tactical nuclear weapon capabilities to
counter Russian capabilities, and reiterated the option of using nuclear
weapons in a non-nuclear scenario. This --- alongside other
technological developments --- signals a significant departure from any
common view of strategic stability, with detrimental implications for
European security, as a colleague and I recently analyzed at length.
**[[Since 2000]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[**several administrations

[understanding that the relationship is defined by

### No Link -- No arctic sanctions

#### NU -- Arctic Council's door is open to Russia -- key to ecology & stability

the Arctic Council Survived Russia's Invasion of Ukraine,\"

(ermo-sms,acc 7-7-2025)

Foreign policy engagement

[[The Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} has been a central arena for
international cooperation in the region for several reasons. First, by
promoting multilateral cooperation through the Council, Arctic states
can counter expansionist ambitions from non-Arctic states and prevent
conflict-driven narratives. The Council also [[serves as a barrier
against the establishment of competing regimes, reinforcing the
legitimacy of]{.underline}]{.mark} frameworks like the [[Law of the
Sea]{.mark}]{.underline} Convention.

Furthermore, the Arctic Council's structure, which includes indigenous
peoples' organizations as permanent participants, adds legitimacy and
ensures diverse perspectives in decision-making. The [[Arctic
Council\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} role in knowledge generation and its
[[established networks have heightened global awareness of Arctic
climate challenges, making its **survival** crucial for continued
environmental collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Finally, the Council\'s origins in the post-Cold War era and its role in
maintaining regional stability underscore its importance. [[The
**transition** of chairmanship from Russia to Norway, coupled with the
**resumption** of project-level work, illustrates the collective
determination of the Arctic states to **ensure the Council\'s continued
existence**, with an **open-door policy for Russia's potential future
re-engagement**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Arctic Council imposed NO sanctions at all

Serafima **Andreeva**, 1-30-20**25**, Jordan Russia Center \"How and Why
the Arctic Council Survived Russia's Invasion of Ukraine,\"
https://jordanrussiacenter.org/blog/how-and-why-the-arctic-council-survived-russias-invasion-of-ukraine,
(ermo-sms,acc 7-7-2025)

[[The legal framework of the Arctic Council is rooted
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the 1996 [[Ottawa]{.underline}]{.mark}
Declaration [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the Arctic Environmental
Protection Strategy ([AEPS]{.underline}), [[which emphasize
consensus-based decision-making]{.underline}]{.mark} among member
states. [[This framework deliberately avoids military
security]{.underline}]{.mark} issues. [[The Council **lacks the
authority** to impose sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}, allowing its
working groups to make clearer recommendations without the constraints
of consensus-driven decision-making. These working groups, some of which
predate the Council itself, have been instrumental in shaping
international environmental policies.

Hence, [[the Arctic Council is more of a decision-**shaping** body than
a decision-**making** one]{.underline}]{.mark}, providing a platform for
non-state actors like indigenous communities to engage in international
governance. Norway's chairship transition in 2023 was made possible
through a combination of established procedural documents and the
strategic plan for 2021--2030. This strategic reliance on existing
frameworks enabled Norway to navigate diplomatic challenges, [[ensuring
the Council's **survival** during a period of **geopolitical
instability**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet procedural feasibility alone
does not fully explain the Council's survival.

### Hardline Bad Turns

#### Turn - Baltic hardline increase risk of Russia war

"Why Are the Baltic States Reckless Drivers in NATO?"
<https://jqas.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Clarke-Analysis.pdf>
(ermo-sms,acc 7-6-2025)

Conclusion

Ultimately, [[the diplomatic actions of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
present challenges for the EU, NATO, and the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}. While [[the Baltic
states]{.underline}]{.mark} are sovereign nations and can conduct
diplomacy as they see fit, their [[**hardline**
approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}, which increase hostility and resentment
with Moscow, [[have **cascading implications** for the Baltics'
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

It is understandable that domestic support for these hardline stances is
strong among the Baltic people -- the long shadow of Soviet occupation,
deportations, gulags, and other travesties is doubtless to inspire these
policy choices. Yet nations as relatively weak as the Baltic states
should be more cautious.

American policymakers have a variety of reasons to support reorienting
NATO's force posture, supporting equitable and transparent integration
efforts for ethnic Russians, and, most importantly, shifting burdens for
7 Baltic defense to Europeans. Congress and the White House can and
should solve these problems -- the reasons to do so beyond reorienting
Baltic policy alone are numerous. Washington can alleviate fiscal
deficits, address compounding equipment and manpower shortages, pivot to
America's peer competitor in Asia, and address rising public sentiment
that Europe is not carrying its own share of the defense burden with
these efforts.

[[Policy changes that encourage adjustments in Baltic behavior are
**increasingly important** with the recent addition of Finland to
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. A larger, better equipped country than its
Baltic neighbors that also carries a harsh history of grievances with
Russia, Finland possesses similarly strong inclinations to use the
perceived cover provided by the United States to engage in "reckless
driving." [[American and NATO policymakers should]{.underline}]{.mark}
take the opportunity to learn the muscle memory of
[[rein]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [[these **risky
behaviors** with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
**now**]{.underline}]{.mark} so that they're prepared should it become
necessary with Finland.

The Baltics will oppose many of these changes, and [[American diplomats
will be put in a difficult position]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[but as the
risk of **outright conflict** between NATO and Russia continues to rise
as the war in Ukraine progresses, **defusing risks elsewhere** remains
critical. **Shaking** Baltic confidence in the United States' commitment
to their security is a **key step** towards reining in their "**reckless
driving**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Instability in the region

In the context where Russia is experiencing challenges in its war of
aggression against Ukraine, [[the Russian government is also likely to
use the Arctic as a venue for asserting its
dominance]{.underline}]{.mark} and demonstrating that Russia is still a
strong military power. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, Russia\'s
prolonged war in Ukraine and [[Western **sanctions** imposed on Russia
because of its aggression, are set to **weaken its conventional forces**
and reduce its military readiness in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}
region in the short term. [[**Because** of this, Russia\'s political and
military leadership may **increase the emphasis on nuclear weapons** in
managing escalation and conflict. This would **increase** the importance
of the Russian Arctic and]{.underline}]{.mark}, in particular, [[the
**Kola Peninsula**, which borders Norway and
Finland]{.underline}]{.mark} and is home to the Northern Fleet, hosting
Russia\'s most advanced Arctic land, air, and naval assets, including
its nuclear deterrent. In addition, the European Centre of Excellence
for Countering Hybrid Threats reportsthat [[Russia has been resorting to
more frequent use of **hybrid tactics**]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as
disinformation, cyber operations, jamming of GPS signals, or even
alleged and not always confirmed cases of targeting key infrastructure)
in the region, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[raises concerns
for NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially its European Nordic members.
While experts do not consider that Russia is likely to directly confront
NATO, [[the **reduced channels** of communication between Russia and
Western countries, Russia\'s intensifying **hybrid** activities and the
risk of Russian **provocations** increase the risk of
**miscalculations** in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The repercussions to come

The full scope of Russia's defeat in the disastrous war and the impact
of political crisis this defeat is certain to generate are beyond even
approximate evaluations. However, some non-apocalyptic foresights are
necessary for various practical political and strategic purposes. It is
clear that [the
huge]{.underline} **[investments]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} [modernizing]{.underline} the
Russian military machine [have
been]{.underline} **[wasted]{.underline}** [and that
the]{.underline} **[degraded]{.underline}** **[economic
base]{.underline}** [will]{.underline} [not]{.underline} [be able
to]{.underline} [support investments]{.underline} of similar
scale [for]{.underline} **[many]{.underline}** **[years]{.underline}** [to
come]{.underline}.45 The question about Moscow's ability to rebuild its
military might continue, nevertheless, to occupy many Western analytical
minds.46 It is in the Baltic theater, which will continue to serve as a
key strategic interface between Russia and NATO, that this question is
particularly loaded.

Reversal of fortunes in conventional deterrence

The reconfiguration of the Baltic theater is so drastic and the shifts
in balances of military power are so fundamental that, for
policy-planners in Helsinki or Warsaw, they appear temporary and even
unnatural―and even more so in Moscow. [Concerns
about]{.underline} possible
Russian **[counter-measures]{.underline}** [necessitated by Finland's
and Sweden's]{.underline} **[accession]{.underline}** to NATO are
serious, but to a large degree [as misplaced]{.underline} [as Shoigu's
plans for deploying an]{.underline} **[army corps]{.underline}** [in
Karelia are]{.underline} **[unlikely]{.underline}** [to come
true]{.underline}. 47 Even in the less probable of possible
futures, [with
combat]{.underline} [operations]{.underline} "**[frozen]{.underline}**"
in approximately the same trenches as currently (which means that
Western commitments to support Ukraine for as long as necessary for
liberating its territory are unfulfilled), Russia will need to maintain
in this pivotal multi-domain theater several military groupings of such
strength that [rebuilding]{.underline} [its]{.underline} **[positions of
power]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} [Baltic and
Arctic]{.underline} [theaters]{.underline} [would
be]{.underline} **[quite]{.underline}** **[impossible]{.underline}**. In
every other scenario, including full withdrawal from all occupied
Ukrainian territories, the scope of damage inflicted to the Russia armed
forces is greater, but the imperative for protecting the south-western
direction against the technologically superior Ukrainian army is strong.

One of the few parameters of Russia's force structure in the Baltic
theater that can be established with reasonable certainty is the combat
order of the **[Baltic]{.underline}** **[fleet]{.underline}**, to which
no major surface combatants or diesel submarines can possibly be added.
48 The [amphibious capabilities will
be]{.underline} **[severely]{.underline}** **[curtailed]{.underline}**,
even if two ageing Ropucha-class landing ships (the third, Minsk, was
hit by the missile strike on September 13), return from the combat
deployment in the Black Sea, because a rehabilitation of the Marine
Brigade would be hampered by the shortage of "elite" manpower.49 [The
main strength of the Baltic Fleet will be]{.underline} **[new
missile]{.underline}** **[corvettes]{.underline}** of the Karakurt
(Project 22800) and Buyan-M (Project 21631) classes carrying long-range
Kalibr and anti-ship Onix missiles. These ships [will
be]{.underline} **[divided]{.underline}** [between the Kronstadt and
Baltiisk naval bases]{.underline},
both **[vulnerable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [hostile]{.underline} [action
and]{.underline} **[far]{.underline}** **[separated]{.underline}** [from
each another]{.underline}.

The irreducible vulnerability of the isolated Kaliningrad region will be
a major problem for Russian strategic planning in the Baltic theater. 50
Russian forces have gained experience in defensive operations holding
the so-called "Surovikin line"; nevertheless, the lesson from the mid-
and long-distance Ukrainian strikes is that no amount of missile defense
systems can turn Kaliningrad into a defensible "fortress".51 The only
way Russia could discourage NATO from executing a full blockade and
swift occupation of Kaliningrad is to increase the capability for
punishing or preventative missile strikes on major urban centers,
including Helsinki and Warsaw. As [NATO]{.underline} [moves toward
a]{.underline} [strategy
of]{.underline} **[denying]{.underline}** [Russia]{.underline} [any
opportunity for conducting an]{.underline} **[offensive
operation]{.underline}** aimed at any of the Baltic states, [Moscow is
compelled to move in the]{.underline} **[opposite
direction]{.underline}**―[toward]{.underline} "**[deterrence by
punishment]{.underline}**".52 The credibility of this posture is boosted
by the conclusions in the West drawn from the execution of
indiscriminate missile and drone strikes on Kyiv, Odesa and many other
Ukrainian cities, and the indifference in Russian society regarding this
cruelty.

Greater reliance on nuclear deterrence

Plain strategic logic dictates that weakness of conventional forces
necessitates greater reliance on nuclear capabilities, and the Baltic
theater may see applications of this logic. In recent Russian strategic
thinking, the Arctic theater, commanded by the Northern Fleet, was
heavily nuclearized, but the Baltic theater was essentially
nuclear-free. The accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO has rendered
this division irrelevant, and deployment of some non-strategic nuclear
weapons to the Baltic theater can be seen by the General Staff as
useful, Kaliningrad being the most obvious destination. The nuclear
storage facility near the Chkalovsk airbase was renovated in 2018, and
the 152nd Guards Rocket Brigade was rearmed with Iskander-M tactical
missiles the same year, but, despite the claim of Lithuanian Defense
Minister Arvydas Anusauskas, there is no hard data on deployment of
nuclear warheads. 53

Russian nuclear rhetoric and blackmail have reached such intensity from
the beginning of the Ukraine war that the problem of restoring the
US-Russia framework of strategic arms control and establishing new
multilateral formats for non-strategic nuclear arms control will
necessarily constitute a key part of the post-war European re-engagement
with Russia.54 Remarkably, [there is]{.underline} also
a **[strong]{.underline}** **[pushback]{.underline}** [in Moscow's
expert community]{.underline} [against]{.underline} the irresponsible
idea of [bringing back]{.underline} [the nuclear]{.underline} "**[fear
factor]{.underline}**" [by delivering
a]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}** **[strike]{.underline}** on,
for example, Poznan.55 [These sober arguments may]{.underline} [find
support]{.underline} not only [among]{.underline} [the
risk-averse]{.underline} **[political]{.underline}** **[elites]{.underline}** [but
also]{.underline} [among the]{.underline} **[top brass]{.underline}**,
perfectly aware that the Russian army in its present shape cannot
possibly engage in combat operations on a nuclear battlefield. Yet,
President Putin rejected resolutely and rudely the prospect of reducing
Russia's nuclear arsenal, and, while such vulgarity may be a feature of
his war-affected personal style of doing business, for every grouping of
elites that might find a way to depose him, the proposition of giving up
Russia's vast advantage in numbers of non-strategic nuclear warheads
would appear singularly unattractive.56 To alter this nuclear-centric,
even nuclear-worshipping attitude, key European states might find it
useful to return in the post-war environment to the question of security
guarantees for Russia, though certainly very different in nature and
substance from the deliberately exaggerated claims advanced by Putin in
December 2021.

Conclusion

Historical examples of Russia implementing radical military reforms
after lost wars (the Crimean war of 1853-1856 being the prime example)
can hardly illuminate the trajectory of transformation after potential
defeat in the disastrous "special military operation". Besides the yet
uncertain scope of this defeat, the problem is that [the
ongoing]{.underline} **[organizational]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[operational
changes]{.underline}** [in the Russian armed
forces]{.underline}, [driven by
the]{.underline} **[setbacks]{.underline}** [in the long
war]{.underline}, [can hardly provide useful directions for further
reforms]{.underline}. While the Ukrainian army is moving forward with
rearmament to modern weapon systems and reorganization for modern
warfare, [the]{.underline} [Russian]{.underline} [army
is]{.underline} **[falling back]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [the
Soviet]{.underline} patterns of a [mass army equipped
with]{.underline} [armaments designed in
the]{.underline} **[pre-information]{.underline}** [technologies]{.underline} [era]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} **[economic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[demographic]{.underline}** **[realities]{.underline}** of
Russia in the 2020s and the decades to come [make]{.underline} [these
resource-consuming]{.underline} [patterns]{.underline} **[unsustainable]{.underline}**.

Strategic thinking in a defeat-internalizing Russia could focus on the
experiences from the kinetic war and on possible new contestation with
Ukraine; yet, it is in the Baltic theater that Moscow will face the most
demanding strategic dilemma. If the post-Putin leadership sticks to the
habitual perceptions of NATO as an inherently hostile and allegedly
aggressive alliance, it will have to concede that the threats to the
Kaliningrad exclave, to the critical transport communications in Karelia
toward the Kola Peninsula, and even to St Petersburg are fundamentally
unmanageable. With the accession of Finland and Sweden to
NATO, [[the]{.underline} **[Baltic]{.underline}** [theater]{.underline}]{.mark}
[is reconfigured]{.underline} [so
profoundly]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[Russia's
disadvantage]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} **[no]{.underline}** **[amount
of]{.underline}** **[effort]{.underline}** [could]{.underline} [make]{.underline} "[Fortress]{.underline} [Kaliningrad]{.underline}" **[defensible]{.underline}**.
Even if a new US administration found it necessary to reduce the
trans-Atlantic
engagement, [the]{.underline} [plans]{.underline} [currently approved by
the]{.underline} **[north
European]{.underline}** [states]{.underline}, [as well
as]{.underline} **[Poland]{.underline}**, [for
increasing]{.underline} **[defense]{.underline}** **[expenditures]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} proceeding
with [acquisitions of]{.underline} **[modern
weapon]{.underline}** [systems]{.underline} are certain to [leave Russia
facing]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}** **[dominance]{.underline}** in
the Baltic airspace and superiority in land power.

[This]{.underline} **[strategic]{.underline}** **[reality]{.underline}** [will
prompt]{.underline} [the new Russian leadership]{.underline}, of
whatever composition and persuasion, [to initiate
a]{.underline} **[de-escalation]{.underline}** [of tensions in
its]{.underline} **[Nordic-Baltic]{.underline}** [neighborhood]{.underline} in
order to avoid a disabling arms race. This prospect might appear far
detached from the present-day discourse on the existential confrontation
between the Russian "state civilization" and the decadent, disunited and
at the same time invariably hostile West. It is useful to reflect,
nevertheless, that the military reforms implemented in Russia as
recently as 2008-2012 were underpinned by the strategic assumption that
a protracted conventional war in Europe was not an
option. [Russia]{.underline} **[cannot afford]{.underline}** [to proceed
with militarized]{.underline} **[confrontation]{.underline}** with the
re-energized Atlantic Alliance, [and its]{.underline} **[ability to
recover]{.underline}** [from potential defeat]{.underline} in the war of
Putin's choice depe[nds directly on returning
to]{.underline} **[cooperative]{.underline}** [formats]{.underline}---and
first of all in the Baltic region, which will then no longer be
perceived as a strategic theater.

[[**Russia's ability** to mount a **major assault** on the
**Baltic**]{.mark} littoral region should not be
**[exaggerated]{.mark}**]{.underline} either. [Strategic [assets]{.mark}
that [Russia]{.mark} supposedly [has]{.mark} at its disposal [can become
**liabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its one formal defense
partner---[**[Belarus]{.mark}**---has proved reluctant to accept
additional forward deployed military assets and to provide diplomatic
support in Russia's territorial disputes]{.underline} with its
neighbors. [Because Belarus has potentially much to lose]{.underline}
from getting involved in any sort of military confrontation between
Russia and NATO, [its leaders [will be hesitant to]{.mark} offer
material [support]{.mark} to Russia, especially [if they fear]{.mark}
becoming the target of [NATO countermeasures]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Moreover, [any massive assault on Poland and the Baltic countries would
require [**extensive stockpiling**]{.mark} of military hardware,
ammunition, medical equipment, and other supplies, which [would provide
NATO]{.mark} defense planners [with **early
warning**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Russian exclave of [[**Kaliningrad**
might]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be
**vulnerable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Swedish [researchers]{.underline}
have [called into question [**Russian A2/AD**
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} located in Kaliningrad and elsewhere,
alleging that [its missile systems [have]{.mark} much [**shorter
ranges** than]{.mark} commonly [presumed]{.mark} and may be [vulnerable
to countermeasures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dalsjö et al. 2019).
[[NATO]{.mark} militaries like the Polish Armed Forces [could
hold]{.mark} at risk [Kaliningrad. The question]{.mark} should
[not]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily [be whether the United States
would trade '[Toledo for Tallinn' but whether Russia would trade
**Kaliningrad for Vilnius**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And indeed, [[Russia
would need the Suwałki Gap]{.mark} as much as NATO would because the
area provides a bridge between Belarus and Kaliningrad. Attempts to
close it]{.underline} necessarily [involve [violating Poland's]{.mark}
territorial [integrity]{.mark} and would [provide justification]{.mark}
for NATO [to escalate.]{.mark}]{.underline} Partly [because of these
difficulties]{.underline} associated with a major conventional attack,
regional [[experts]{.underline}]{.mark} and government officials
[[judge]{.mark} the **[probability]{.mark}** of something of this sort
happening [to be **low**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lanoszka and Hunzeker
2019, 29--30, 79). That is not to say Russia is weak; for example, its
widening missile advantages still create gaps in NATO's deterrence
posture. But **[[Russia is not a]{.mark} military
[juggernaut]{.mark}]{.underline}** either.

**Russia [won't]{.underline} invade**

In all of these efforts, it is important for NATO to see Russia as it is
and not as it was. To be clear, there is no question that Russia meddles
in the affairs of its neighbors; its annexation of Crimea and support to
the Donbass insurgency speak plainly to this. But Russia, like any
power, is bound by the limits of its capabilities and they are not
infinite. [Russian economic resources are]{.underline}, at best, [those
of a middle power]{.underline}. In 2018, its Gross Domestic Product
([GDP]{.underline}) [ranked eleventh]{.underline} after the likes of
Canada; price-adjusted GDP is slightly more impressive at sixth overall
globally, but still leaves Russia trailing Germany, India, Japan, the
United States, and China.\[19\] [[Russia]{.mark} has [chose]{.mark}n [to
expend]{.mark} these limited [resources]{.mark} [on]{.mark} an at least
half a dozen neo-imperial projects in Abkhazia, Chechnya, Crimea, the
Donbass, Transnistria, and South Ossetia]{.underline}. There is also
Russia's open-ended [[military]{.underline}]{.mark} commitment in Syria.
Each of these [[adventures]{.underline}]{.mark} costs money[, [limiting
Moscow]{.mark}'s ability to placate its population through social
programs]{.underline}. That Vladimir Putin's popularity took perhaps its
worst hit after he was forced to raise the retirement age speaks to the
long-term risks inherent in supporting what are essentially six
mini-client states.\[20\] Militarily, Russia has steadily rebuilt itself
since the nadir of the early 1990s. In particular, Russia took pains to
learn from its shaky performance during the 2008 war with Georgia and
implement needed reforms.\[21\] That said, [[Russia]{.mark} of today [is
nowhere near the]{.mark} menace that the [Red Army]{.mark} once was
believed to be]{.underline}. And while it would be wrong to say that
funds aren't available for Russian military modernization, **[planned
[investments]{.mark} [reflect modest improvements]{.mark} rather than
transformative capabilities]{.underline}**.\[22\] NATO's strategic depth
has also radically changed since the Cold War, through both the
inclusion of Poland and the territory of East Germany. Russian forces
must now also traverse either Belarus or Ukraine before even touching
the edge of NATO's main territory. There is, obviously, the important
exception of the Baltic states which will be examined later. For all the
understandable concern over Russian aggression in the wake of the
Crimean annexation, it is essential to remember that [the overall
military situation and balance of forces has improved remarkably for
NATO in the past thirty years]{.underline}. **[[Russia's]{.mark} overall
conventional [threat to NATO is]{.mark} thus extremely
[limited]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Would Russia have]{.mark} the
[wherewithal]{.mark} [to occupy]{.mark} Belarus and Ukraine and then
still successfully invade Poland, let alone to enter German territory?
[It seems]{.mark} extremely [unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Forcibly
[placating]{.mark} Belarus and/or Ukraine alone [might stretch]{.mark}
Russian [capabilities to their limits]{.mark} and there still is the
question of economically supporting a prolonged occupation of those
territories]{.underline}.

Limited Russian strategic interest in the Baltics. Our review of
**[[Russian documents]{.mark} and recent Russian strategic literature
[found]{.mark} very [little discussion of the Baltic]{.mark} States as
an important strategic area]{.underline}**. To be sure, [[Russia has
taken]{.mark} and is continuing to take [**limited** aggressive]{.mark}
[actions]{.mark} toward the Baltic States through political, media,
intelligence, and cyber efforts.]{.underline} [But [we could identify
no]{.mark} serious [discussion of]{.mark} the strategic value of
[retaking]{.mark} part or all of [the Baltic States]{.mark}, either for
their intrinsic value or as a way of weakening NATO]{.underline}. This
lack of discussion of the Baltics was in sharp contrast to some other
former Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Georgia, which represent a
much greater focus. **[[Any Russian decision to confront NATO]{.mark}

The sound of BM-21 rockets streaking across the sky. The smell of spent
brass and burned powder. The rumble of BTR-82 armored personnel carriers
rolling through a narrow street. Rebels sprinting from building to
building through an open field of fire. These sights do not evoke a
striking imagine of a modern European country, but Russian posturing in
the region might lead to this. After the collapse of the Soviet Union,
international spectators believed this Eurasian military powerhouse
would cease. However, the Russian Federation has returned to its old
Cold War ways, [[increasing
aggressive]{.underline}](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/030415_Pifer_Testimony.pdf)
activities against its neighbors in an attempt to stymie North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion. As seen with the annexation of
Crimea in 2014 or the liberation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the
2008 Georgian War, Russia has used its military to destabilize bordering
nations. Many leaders are worried that similar actions could be taken
against the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Unlike
Ukraine, these three countries are [[a part
of]{.underline}](https://www.nato.int/cps/em/natohq/topics_52044.htm)
NATO, presenting a prime target for Russian president Vladimir Putin.
However, future aggression will likely come in the form of the hybrid
warfare attacks as seen in Ukraine and Georgia rather than an all-out
invasion [[like many
think]{.underline}](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/if-you-want-peace-prepare-resistance%E2%80%9D-18480).
As Catherine Harris and Frederick Kagan from the Institute for the Study
of War [[have hinted
at]{.underline}](http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Russian%20Ground%20Forces%20OOB_ISW%20CTP_0.pdf),
"The Russian military is well-positioned to launch a conventional war in
Ukraine and a hybrid war in the Baltic States, the opposite of what
Western leaders seem to be expecting in each theater." [[Russia
is]{.mark} simply [not]{.mark} prepared or properly [positioned
to]{.mark} execute a well-coordinated, conventional [attack]{.mark} on
[the Baltics.]{.mark} The amount of [Russian units]{.mark} in close
proximity to make a rapid assault [is limited,]{.mark} and [most]{.mark}
of these [formations would take]{.mark} significant [time and resources
to mobilize]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It would require a large and
complex movement of troops, vehicles, and equipment to successfully plan
and execute such an operation. Such activity would surely catch the eye
of NATO members, alerting them to a likely invasion. Instead, Russian
posture is best suited for hybrid warfare against these neighboring
countries. [With the Baltic States on Russia's Western border, the
Western Military District (WMD) \[Западный военный округ\] would be
ultimately responsible for Russian military operations in that
region.]{.underline} These districts are similar to the United States
geographical combatant commands such as European Command (EUCOM) and
Central Command (CENTCOM), which have separate units and command
structures from multiple branches across specific regions. [Russia's WMD
contains all units permanently present in the western-most part of the
country while also including the enclave of Kaliningrad bordering Poland
and Lithuania. Although it is comprised of naval, air, ground, cyber,
electronic, and nuclear capabilities, the number of assets in the region
and their locations simply do not lend themselves to making a surprise,
conventional assault on the Baltics.]{.underline} For instance, 2017
[[figures]{.underline}](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2400/RR2402/RAND_RR2402.pdf)
show that there are twenty-two combat brigades and over 1,200 aircraft
within the vicinity of the Baltics, making it a very capable force.
However, these numbers do not tell the full story. [Hypothetically, [if
Russia were to conduct]{.mark} a combined-arms [invasion]{.mark} of [the
Baltic]{.mark} States tomorrow[, only a small number of forces
would]{.mark} be properly positioned to [attack]{.mark}.]{.underline}
There are plenty of armored and mechanized units nearby, however, the
only truly capable and quick reaction military unit available for a
surprise assault would be the 76th Guards Air Assault Division (GAAD).
Based in Pskov only twenty miles from the border of Estonia, they could
utilize cargo aircraft (e.g. Il-76), and helicopters (e.g. Mi-8, Mi-17,
and Mi-24) for airborne operations, striking the Baltics with little
warning. Additionally, it is reported that the GAAD has recent [[combat
experience in
Ukraine]{.underline}](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/only-10-made-it-back-tapes-reveal-russias-secret-war-ws8vxchm36g).
This is an overlooked aspect when talking about the effectiveness of
armed forces. Size and equipment is not the only thing that determines a
unit's effectiveness. Recent tactical combat experience can also
increase lethality, something the GAAD now excels in. [Although speed
and experience is great, especially in a hypothetical Baltic campaign,
these [air assault units simply do not have the heavy weaponry,
equipment, or logistics to maintain an offensive posture against NATO
combat uni]{.mark}ts.]{.underline} They are outfitted for quick and
rapid deployments rather than sustained fighting with a superior force
such as a U.S. Army Armored Brigade Combat Team. To counter this, Russia
would have to mobilize their armored and mechanized forces, turning the
conflict into an even bigger conventional conflict, something Putin
knows would not fare well against American/NATO airpower. Instead, a
more predictable, logical, and less risky approach Russia might take
would be utilizing hybrid warfare tactics like they did against Ukraine
in the Crimea and the Donetsk region. By encouraging the ethnic Russian
speaking populations within the three Baltic countries to side with
Russia, Putin could supply these break off enclaves with weapons and
equipment to sustain a secessionist insurgency, like he did during the
Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. [If necessary, the GAAD could
provide very small, but direct support in a feigned attempt to protect
these ethnic Russians, as Russia did in the 2008 Georgian
War]{.underline}. With their expeditionary capability to deliver rapid
firepower in proximity of the Baltics, the GAAD would be perfectly
positioned for this type of deployment. This form of warfighting would
undermine the stability and capability of a NATO country and possibly
the viability of the alliance in the long-term; precisely what Putin
seeks.

**NATO deterrence is effective in the Baltics now due to Article V**

The defensibility of NATO's northeastern flank [[NATO
enlargement]{.mark} has provided a key source of insurance by
[rais]{.mark}ing the [costs of direct Russian aggression]{.mark} against
alliance members]{.underline}. **[This is [true even in]{.mark} arguably
[the weakest part]{.mark} of the alliance, [the Baltic]{.mark} littoral
region]{.underline}**. [Conventional wisdom holds that the defense of
this region against Russian aggression is especially costly for the USA
and NATO to undertake]{.underline}. [The countries]{.underline} located
there [are exceptionally vulnerable]{.underline}. Whereas most
benefciaries of NATO enlargement are at least largely separated from
Russia thanks to Belarus and Ukraine, the Baltic countries are directly
contiguous and have only a short land connection to continental NATO by
way of the Polish--Lithuanian border. [According to this perspective, a
rebalancing of alliance commitments in Europe is necessary because the
local military balance favors Russia too much and the political will to
defend the Baltic states is too low]{.underline}. [The USA will never
'trade Toledo for Tallinn']{.underline} (Shifrinson 2017, 111). [[Note
the contradiction]{.mark}: According to critics, [enlarging NATO
simultaneously provokes Russia and weakens the
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [what rational cause would Russia
have to be dismayed when a potentially adversarial military alliance
willingly takes on major liabilities?]{.underline} The alliance security
dilemma---whereby the strengthening of one coalition may inadvertently
create insecurity for another---suggests that Russia would be
justifiably concerned if NATO either incorporated states that
meaningfully aggregate capabilities or increased military ties with such
powerful states (Snyder 1984, 477). By NATO enlargement critics' own
admission, the Baltic countries subtract from, rather than add to, what
the alliance can do. Russian might have reasons to protest enlargement,
but these reasons likely concern the perceived slight to its honor when
former Soviet states became formal defense partners of the USA (Götz
2017, 236--239).4 NATO enlargement has not been responsible for Russian
authoritarianism or international revisionism because it never
threatened Russia. **[[Pessimism regarding the]{.mark} defensibility of
NATO's so-called [northeastern flank is]{.mark} also
[unwarranted]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To begin with, [much of the policy
literature on this region concentrates on Russia's strengths while
ignoring its key weaknesses]{.underline}. **[The Baltic countries would
almost surely lose set piece battles against Russia, but deterrence
ultimately hinges less on being victorious in a potential war than on
imposing unacceptable costs on the adversary]{.underline}**. The Baltic
states have already begun embracing unconventional strategies intended
to boost national resiliency and make occupation difficult (Collins and
Beehner 2019). Guerrilla tactics and territorial defense serve to
augment their denial capabilities that in turn would complicate Russian
efforts to hold territory and pacify the local population. Moreover,
[[Russia may have local]{.mark} escalation dominance, [but it does not
have global escalation dominance]{.mark}, given the forces that NATO
members possess. [A large-scale land grab]{.mark} made at the expense of
any of the Baltic countries [might precipitate escalatory
dynamics]{.mark} that [it could not control]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[Nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}** may be a remote possibility, but
it **[cannot be discounted]{.underline}** altogether. [[One
reason]{.mark} why [Russia]{.mark} has [resorted to]{.mark} so-called
[hybrid]{.mark} tactics against the Baltic countries]{.underline}---such
as political subversion and efforts to foment unrest---[is that it [does
not wish to provoke a reaction]{.mark} that [it cannot
handle]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lanoszka 2016). Put simply,
**[[Russia]{.mark} may [believe]{.mark} in NATO's [Article Five]{.mark}
collective defense commitment [more than NATO members]{.mark} themselves
do]{.underline}**.
