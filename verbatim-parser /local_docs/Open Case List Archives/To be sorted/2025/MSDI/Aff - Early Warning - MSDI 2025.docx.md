ii\. Areas of divergence

[[The most important change in Arctic intelligence collection is the
shift in the function and scale of information gathered, a trend that
began in the mid-20 th century. States]{.underline}]{.mark} specifically
[[collected]{.underline}]{.mark} World War II-era [[intelligence to
support kinetic operations]{.underline}]{.mark}, with aerial imaging
gauging enemy threats ahead of campaigns in Alaska or Scandinavia.
[[Information operations]{.underline}]{.mark} expanded during the Cold
War but [[remained limited to monitoring the GIUK
gap]{.underline}]{.mark} and likely routes for Soviet incursions. It was
only with the turn of the 21 st century that technology-enabled
monitoring expanded in the Arctic. Intelligence powers like the US,
Russia, and Canada are deploying more missions than ever, as confirmed
by reports of near-daily reconnaissance flights and hourly satellite
passovers. Smaller Arctic nations are establishing their own robust
domain awareness programs, no longer content to support the intelligence
operations of the US or NATO.

Interestingly, [[the evolution of Arctic intelligence
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the tactical ([[single-issue
reconnaissance]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
strategic (routine [[domain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[has
**bucked** global trends]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the 21 st century,
W[[estern intelligence agencies have overwhelmingly focused on
"intelligence for **action**]{.underline}]{.mark}," generally in support
of counter-terrorism operations. In 2005, [[just
20-25%]{.underline}]{.mark} of US intelligence resources [[were
devoted]{.underline}]{.mark} to the kind [[of long-term, strategic
products that]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[seem to be the norm in the
Arctic, as compared to 60% in 1990]{.underline}]{.mark} (Bury and
Chertoff 2020, 46).

### 1AC -- Plan

#### The United States federal government should use a Unified Command through the Arctic 7 for coordinated development of early warning systems in the Arctic, including sensors, drones, submarines, and satellites to monitor shipping, military assets, and the environment.

**The plan's unified command helps integrate arctic data**

To address C2 concerns within the United States, [[there are strong
arguments for "creating a **separate**, subregional command" **in the
Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as argued in previous publications that
would fall [[under the "direction of USNORTHCOM]{.underline}]{.mark} for
the purpose of protecting the homeland and its own avenues of approach
from the North Pacific and North Atlantic." If this were implemented,
[[the new command should **better integrate**]{.underline}]{.mark} the
Department of [[Homeland Security]{.underline}]{.mark}, with specific
focus on the US [[Coast Guard]{.underline}]{.mark}, which has key law
enforcement, search and rescue, [[and **situational
awareness**]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities in the American Arctic.
Moreover, US military planners and the executive branch should once
again re-assess the US Unified Command Plan (UCP) [[**specifically for**
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} to better incorporate greater
Sino-Russian alignment and engagement in the Arctic.

[[Rather than modifying existing capabilities to fit the environment,
the Department of Defense]{.underline}]{.mark} and industrial partners
[[should think]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[strategically about
Arctic-**specific** capabilities and]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Brookings
Institution experts point out, "[[develop]{.underline}]{.mark} operating
[[concepts that]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn,
[[drive]{.underline}]{.mark} the requirements and
[[capability]{.underline}]{.mark} development that support mobility and
sustainment of its modernization platforms [[**in** Arctic
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}." In short, [[capabilities should be
Arctic by **design**, not by default]{.underline}]{.mark}. This also
applies to new technologies [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} autonomous
systems and [[communication technology, which should be enablers, not
drivers of policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. This should also be taken into
consideration when it comes to pooling and sharing resources and
approaches to R&D in the Nordic context---a topic that will be explored
below.

[[Bolstering domain and situational awareness should be the **first
priority**]{.underline}]{.mark} for the United States and its partners.
This means [[greater investments in air, space, and]{.underline}]{.mark}
missile defense capabilities and better
[[communications]{.underline}]{.mark} and ground-based space
[[systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to the priorities
highlighted above, [[dedicated satellite communication and
geo-positioning capabilities, internet connectivity and fiber optic
cables, and Arctic-specific]{.underline}]{.mark} power [[generation
and]{.underline}]{.mark} power [[storage]{.underline}]{.mark}
technologies will be needed.

hardware and equip[[ment are paramount for successfully deterring
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}'s contestation efforts
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [[Chinese
encroachments]{.underline}]{.mark}. As part of multidomain threat
detection, [[comprehensive domain awareness must be prioritized
through]{.underline}]{.mark} aerial [[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark},
maritime [[domain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[space]{.underline}]{.mark}-based assets, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} domain and [[across the electromagnetic
spectrum]{.underline}]{.mark}.

• Better domain awareness must also happen jointly between the Arctic/
NATO 7 and their partners. This will require increased intelligence
sharing and focus on interagency cooperation. Ultimately, [[the goal
is]{.underline}]{.mark} to reach [[full seabed-to-space circumpolar
awareness with multidomain data fusion, ISR, and networks of overlapping
sensors]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The North American Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, through approaches in
both the North Pacific and North Atlantic, [[continues to pose a
security dilemma for the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
cooperation with allies and partners, [[defense planners
must]{.underline}]{.mark} work to defend this critical frontier and
[[urgently address gaps in domain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} and
posture to ensure the US homeland is secure, [[in spite
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the growing risks associated with [[great power
competition and Sino-Russian cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The current **window of opportunity** should not be wasted. Russia's
**preoccupation** with Ukraine, China's **still limited** capacity in
the region, and **new Nordic members** that strengthen NATO's
capabilities in the Arctic, provide an opportunity]{.underline}]{.mark}
for the United States and its allies [[to strengthen their situational
awareness, readiness, and "integrated deterrence" posture to deter and
defend against impending threats]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the same time,
[[lessons from]{.underline}]{.mark} the war in [[Ukraine can

Chapter 3: The role and place of modern technology in the Arctic

[[The Arctic]{.mark} is **ripe** for **contestation**]{.underline} with
emerging and disruptive technologies. [The regional **threat
environment** [requires **new tech**]{.mark}nologies [to]{.mark} better
[identify **threats**]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially low-intensity
warfare activities coming from Russia and China, [as well as to achieve
overall **domain awareness**]{.underline}. Future deterrence concepts
will also have to stay relevant in the face of modern technologies, and
especially considering remote access to a changing Arctic.

1\) Arctic-specific capabilities

[Continued [**investments** in]{.mark} Arctic-specific
[hardware]{.mark}]{.underline} and equipment [[are **paramount**
for]{.mark} successfully [**deterring** Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}'s
contestation efforts [[and Chinese]{.mark} regional
**[encroachments]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More than ever, Arctic
capabilities must respond to specific missions.

NATO and allies must define what capabilities they will require to
operate in the region. As noted above, across the NATO 7 nations
[critical capabilities [**gaps abound**, in]{.mark}]{.underline} cold
weather [hardware]{.underline}, ice-strengthened assets, ice-capable
ships with anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities,129
infrastructure suited for [effective **[early warning]{.mark}** threat
detection systems and air defense]{.underline},130 [**[radar]{.mark}**
coverage [and]{.mark} aerial **[domain awareness]{.mark}**, subsea
**sensing**, and Arctic-related **logistics**]{.underline} and
resupplies, among others.

An essential part of the US DoD Arctic strategy's "monitor-and-respond"
approach is to enhance US Arctic capabilities in critical areas such as
domain awareness and dedicated cold weather equipment.50 [[Yet the US
and]{.mark} the [Arctic 7]{.mark} as a whole [have a **low starting
point**]{.mark}]{.underline} in terms of cold weather and
ice-strengthened capabilities.

Regarding conventional capabilities, the current environment has shown
the need to increase physical access and presence in the region thanks
to icebreakers. Recognizing that it will not close the "icebreaker gap"
on its own, the US recently unveiled a trilateral partnership with
Canada and Finland called the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE
Pact.131 The ICE Pact will help build polar icebreakers and other
surface assets in the logic of burden sharing and comparative advantages
--- although it heavily leans on ensuring job security and retaining
skills in US shipyards.

Another paramount priority in conventional capabilities is the continued
modernization of North Warning System assets and NORAD more widely. The
2023 incident with "Chinese spy balloons"132 depicted not only the
importance of NORAD for threat identification and destruction but also
how vulnerable the system was in terms of blind spots, especially early
threat identification and wider domain awareness.

NORAD modernization is slow to materialize but essential: A modern and
robust air defense is instrumental in keeping the whole Arctic secure,
and not just North American skies. As part of North Warning System
upgrades, new over-the-horizon radars will partly solve the issue of
early threat detection and tracking. This must happen in parallel with
improvements in multilayered and multipurpose remote sensing
capabilities, including for space-based threats.

Finally, the Arctic 7 must continue to invest in offensive, standoff
capabilities that can help counter Russian regional military assets.
This includes better air defense and long-range missile systems to
contest Russian ambitions of control (Bastion defense) and denial
(extended anti-access and area denial systems) beyond the AZRF. It also
involves anti-submarine warfare, mine counter-measure capabilities, and
maritime patrol aviation capabilities --- an area where NATO lacks
operational practice.133 Another important aspect is to harden Western
Arctic military infrastructure and systems against Russian cyber and
electromagnetic warfare capabilities.

#### That causes [miscalculated]{.underline} nuclear war and [attacks]{.underline} on [undersea cables]{.underline}.

**Loftus 25** \[Tom Loftus (Former U.S. ambassador to Norway),
2-27-2025, \"The Hot New Cold War in the Arctic: Norway prepares for
"crisis and war",\" Outrider,

njn\]

Today, the reports of the activity at Andøya capture the new Cold War in
the Arctic. It's like a snow globe, serene until you shake it---then
there's a storm.

Just before President Donald Trump took office for the second time in
January, the US signed a Technology Safeguard Agreement to authorize the
transfer of US commercial missile launchers to Norway. Given President
Trump's desire to protect the US with an "Iron Dome" anti-missile
defense system and his controversial statements about annexing
Greenland, US relations with countries with geographic and strategic
ties to the Arctic region are being tested.

[[This is a]{.mark} fragile, [**tense** situation]{.mark} for both
Russia and Norway, [where]{.mark} the chance of [an **accident** or
**miscalculation** could lead to a **nuclear
incident**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We must avoid this at all costs.

Now, Andøya Rocket Range has been rechristened as the Andøya Space Port,
as Norway establishes a base for long-range military drones; Norway and
the US are building an arctic satellite station to detect incoming enemy
missiles. It is the first of its kind outside the United States,
according to the Norwegian Minister of Defense, Bjørn Arild Gram.

"[[Space activity is]{.mark} becoming [more important for
defense]{.mark} cooperation]{.underline}, and Andøya is of great value
for Norway as well as for our allies," said Gram.

Forgotten history

Norway, a founding member of NATO, borders Russia on the Barents Sea in
the Arctic Ocean. A look at the map will show the City of Murmansk,
Russia's only ice-free port and sole access to the Atlantic Ocean. The
Russian Navy's nuclear submarine fleet is in the inlets nearby. They are
armed with nuclear ballistic and cruise missiles targeted at the United
States.

Russian heavy bombers, similar to American B-52s, now fly the 1200-mile
route from Murmansk to drop their payloads in Ukraine. In return,
Ukraine sends attack drones to Murmansk. The social media photos from
Murmansk show grieving mothers clutching flowers in front of fresh
graves at new cemeteries full of the area's sons killed by the fighting
in Ukraine.

Based on American technology, a Norwegian mobile air defense system is
being tested at the new Andøya base for long-range drones. This is a
variant of the surface-to-air system that shoots down the Russian drones
attacking Kyiv.

[The Russian invasion of [Ukraine and]{.mark} the subsequent
[**threats** of]{.mark} the use of **[nuclear weapons]{.mark}** by
President Putin has [brought Norway back to **Viking
mode**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

All of this is [[in reaction to Russia **building** up its **nuclear
sub**]{.mark}marine [fleet and **provocative** nuclear]{.mark} war
**[exercises]{.mark}**]{.underline} by its navy near Norway.

[[Adding to the risk]{.mark} of conflict [is the recent **malicious
damage** to **undersea cables**]{.mark} in Norwegian
waters]{.underline}, including the main communication link to Evenes
airbase in north Norway, NATO's first line of defense nearest Russia.

Alas, the Russians have now ended cooperation on the safekeeping of
nuclear weapons and waste relating to the Russian Navy based in Murmansk
in place since 1997.

I had a hand in negotiating the original agreement and made many trips
to Murmansk. On each trip, I passed by the Valley of Glory, where
thousands of Soviet (and German) troops died over the five-year battle
to prevent Adolf Hitler from taking the port of Murmansk.

The Soviet Red Army liberated northern Norway from the German
occupation. After the war, the Soviets left, went home, and closed the
border again. Only in the early 1990s---after the dissolution of the
Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War---did a new border crossing
open. It was a symbol of the optimistic years of the 20th century for
America and Europe.

Ferdinand the bull could be found again in his field of flowers.

But memories are short, and [[things **fell apart**]{.mark} again in the
Arctic [after]{.mark} the Russian invasion of
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Norwegian health authorities sent stockpiles of iodine pills to all
parts of the country to be taken in case of radioactive fallout from a
nuclear weapons accident]{.underline}. Iodine tablets block the
absorption of radioactive material by the thyroid gland and reduce the
risk of contracting cancer.

Moreover, on January 10, 2025, the Prime Minister's office issued a
white paper to local governments and the general populace on "total
preparedness...for crisis and war."

"We are taking steps to ensure that civil society is equipped to deal
with a crisis or war. Our civil society must be able to back up military
efforts and withstand complex threats," said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr
Støre.

The document addressed the recent "pandemic, extreme weather events and
cyber attacks," Norway faced, but also Russia's threats to NATO and its
allies.

Almost World War III

[Amid all [this reckless]{.mark} Russian
**[saber-rattling]{.mark}**]{.underline}, we can count on the Norwegians
to do the right thing. They have dealt with the Russians on their border
for a thousand years. But [it all [can go **wrong**]{.mark}, just [by
**accident**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

I spent January 18-20, 1995, at the Andøya Rocket Range to witness the
launch of an American research rocket.

The launch was of the powerful Black Brant XII, which would peak at
1,400 kilometers over the Norwegian island of Svalbard. It was part of a
research project by Cornell University to gather daytime data on the
northern lights. They had obtained the US rocket

under a NASA program.

Bad weather at the Range delayed the launch, and I returned to Oslo for
meetings with the departing Russian Ambassador. On January 25, the
launch went off---and within seconds, the Russian early warning radar
system near Murmansk tagged it as a possible nuclear missile attack by
the United States.

This rocket\'s speed and suspicious trajectory triggered a mid-level
automated alert, and the first steps of the Russian response began. The
missile stayed on its course, with the last stage dropping into the sea
320 kilometers northeast of Svalbard. It did not enter Russian airspace,
and the alert was over before the Russian general in charge could get
from his nearby office to the command-and-control center.

Word of this alert reached the Russian news service Interfax. It was
first reported that a rocket had been shot down. This was quickly
corrected, but the next day, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was quoted
as saying he had been given the "black box," the instrument with the
keys to launch a nuclear counterattack.

The Russian economy and government were in shambles at this time, and
there were domestic political reasons for the mercurial president to
appear strong and in charge.

Within two days, the world press treated the incident as a farce and an
example of Russian incompetence. It was not a joke, and we are all
lucky. A lot could have ended in tragedy.

Fortunately, the Black Brant remained on course and did not enter
Russian airspace, and the Russian early warning system and those in
control of it that day acted appropriately. Had the missile been
perceived as a threatening nuclear missile, the outcome could have been
disastrous.

On January 26, the day after the incident, I was with the Russian
ambassador for his farewell reception. I certainly did not mention to
him (and saw no reason to report to the State Department) that I had
been at Andøya just before this launch. We said goodbye and wished each
other good luck and, with a full-throated "Nostrovia!" ("Cheers!") threw
down a shot of vodka.

[It's time to stop this **cat-and-mouse** game in which both sides think
they are the cat. Both sides believe [the potential for an
**accidental** nuclear incident is
**high**]{.mark}---obviously]{.underline}, Norway's Prime Minister
thinks so. It's important to recognize the essential role of diplomacy
and cooperation with our allies---and even our enemies---when it comes
to nuclear security.

We need to learn from the past, and [[the US needs to]{.mark} again
[take a **leadership role** in avoiding **nuclear
annihilation**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Undersea cable attacks cause [extinction]{.underline}\-\--only preventative [deterrence]{.underline} solves.

**Bennett 19** \[Alexander Bennett (J.D., Seton Hall University School
of Law), 2019, "Submarine Cables and Infrastructure Vulnerabilities:
Threats from Private and State Actors," Law School Student Scholarship,
https://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1954&context=student_scholarship,
njn\]

Michael Sechrist of the Harvard University Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs stated that the worst case scenario for a hack of
the internet cables could be the following:

What is [[the **nightmare** scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}? A hacker
penetrates a cable management system, gains administrative rights, and
hacks into the presentation server. Presentation servers can host
webbased \[sic\] applications for numerous cable operators and handle
management system data for multiple cable systems. Hacking into a
presentation server can therefore provide attackers with access to
control of multiple cable management systems. Hackers could then attain
unprecedented toplevel \[sic\] views of multiple cable networks and data
flows, discover physical cable vulnerabilities, and [**disrupt** and
divert data traffic]{.underline}. With that access, hackers/attackers
can gain a potential "kill click" -- with a click of a mouse they
[[can]{.mark} delete wavelengths and]{.underline}, potentially,
[[significantly **disrupt**]{.mark} or alter [global **Internet
traffic**]{.mark} routes]{.underline}.

[[This]{.mark} nightmare scenario [is **all too
realistic**]{.mark}]{.underline} as the companies which operate the
undersea cables use commonplace operating systems like Linux and
Windows.44 The network management systems which these companies use
enable them to remotely control entire cables from a remote location at
the company. These connectivity possibilities make maintaining the lines
and gathering information about the cables very convenient, yet the
connections are also vulnerable to virtual hijacking in a scenario as
described above by Mr. Sechrist. 45

XI\. International Law, the Law of War, and International Humanitarian
Law

Whether their motive is information mining or to attack infrastructures
it is evident that [the [preventative **NATO measures**]{.mark} being
planned [are paramount to the **ongoing threat**]{.mark} to the cables.
[The **threat**]{.mark} by Russian activities [is]{.mark} also [an
**unexplored area**]{.mark} of law]{.underline} for the most part. The
term "cyber warfare" is relatively new and also very ambiguous as it
relates to attacks by one country on another. The International
Humanitarian Law ("IHL") "applies to cyber operations occurring during
\[...\] or triggering\[...\] an armed conflict. However, determining the
beginning of an armed conflict remains tricky in situations\[...\] short
of any kinetic use of force." 46 So basically, given the present-day
principles of IHL, a country can launch a cyber-attack such as
interrupting infrastructure communications without maintaining a
physical presence in the victim nation thus not implicating the
traditional "Laws of War".

The Laws of War are part of international law that includes provisions
to regulate the appropriate and justifiable reasons to engage in war
between states (jus ad bellum) and the acceptable conduct during war
(jus in bello). 47 The goals of these laws of war as part of the larger
picture of IHL, which aim to limit the suffering caused by armed
conflict between nation states. Yet cyber-attack falls outside of the
traditional definition of war and therefore needs to be addressed on the
international level. This uncertainty leaves many openings for very
damaging attacks to occur without invoking consequences on the
perpetrators.

The difficulty in defining cyber hacking and attacks as warfare is
because traditional warfare takes place in some physical space while
"cyberspace" is a virtual space. This difference causes a disconnect in
the evaluation of such cyber-attacks. The ICRC discusses the various
elements of newly emerging cyber aggression and posits that "\[t\]he
effects of such 'bloodless' attacks could obviously be severe -- for
instance, if power or water supplies were to be interrupted or if a
banking system were to be taken down."48 It is this leap, from the
virtual actions of foreign nations, to the physical world of a country
across an ocean that has lawmakers and governments not sure how to
define this new type of aggression. It is the position of this paper
that such attacks on infrastructure, whether it be internet or a power
grid, is a deliberate act of war by another country. This does not mean
that every time a foreign country is found to have hacked the United
States that war drums should sound, yet it is strongly advisable that
the US respond proportionally to such threats to deter escalation.

Another major threat of attacks on infrastructure like the undersea
cables, both physically or virtually, is the risk of what are known as
"indiscriminate attacks". The indiscriminate attacks in the traditional
sense are violations of IHL. The International Court of Justice in The
Hague, Netherlands issued an advisory opinion in 1996 regarding the
legality of threat or use of nuclear weapons in which the court
discussed indiscriminate attacks. The ICJ serves as the principal
judicial organ of the UN and its purpose is to "settle, in accordance
with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to
give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized
United Nations organs and specialized agencies."49

Although the opinion is about nuclear weapons the same principles to the
indiscriminate nature of cyber-attack, the ICJ says weapons are
prohibited "because of their indiscriminate effect on combatants and
civilians."50 Cyber weapons should be placed in this same category
because attacks on infrastructure will not be limited to military
installation and the accuracy of such attacks is similar to explosives
in that there is peripheral damage to civilians. This peripheral damage
example is strongly exemplified by the ICRC's Report: ICRC,
International Humanitarian Law and the challenges of contemporary armed
conflicts in 2015. It states:

Most [[**military networks** rely on civilian]{.mark} cyber
infrastructure, such as **[undersea]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[fiber\]-
[[optic **cables**]{.mark}, satellites, routers or nodes]{.underline}.
Conversely, civilian vehicles, shipping, and air traffic controls are
increasingly equipped with navigation systems that rely on global
positioning system (GPS) satellites, which are also used by the
military. [Civilian logistical **[supply chains]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([[for **food** and **medical supplies**]{.underline}]{.mark}) and other
businesses [[use the same]{.mark} web and communication
[networks]{.mark} through which some military communications
pass]{.underline}. Thus, [it is to a large extent **impossible** to
**differentiate** between purely **civilian** and purely **military**
cyber **infrastructures**]{.underline}.51

Conclusion

The connectivity of the entire globe relies on about 400
garden-hose-size cables stretching thousands of miles. [The
[cables]{.mark}, which [could]{.mark} at any time [be
**severed**]{.mark} and disrupted [by]{.mark} various **[bad
actors]{.mark}**, as **very vulnerable**]{.underline}. Most alarming is
that [**[strong ev]{.mark}**idence [points toward a **Russian
initiative**]{.mark} to bolster their military power]{.underline}, seek
alternative non-physical forms of attacks and to mask responsibility for
hacking type attacks. These [[indicators]{.mark} also [point
toward]{.mark} a [**vulnerability** of]{.mark} the undersea **internet
[cables]{.mark}** [being attacked by **Russia**]{.mark} in order
[to]{.mark} limit or **[cut]{.mark}** out **[communication]{.mark}**
within the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and also
between the United States and its allies. The days of traditional
kinetic projectile warfare have not yet gone by the wayside, yet, they
are slowly taking on a secondary spot in the arsenals of advanced

[[Russia is **\'fully ready\'** to **detonate** a nuclear bomb in the
Arctic at **\'any moment\'**]{.underline}]{.mark}, it was revealed today
as Vladimir Putin presses on with drills unseen since the Cold War.

The director of an old Soviet test site first in the Novaya Zelmlya
archipelago insisted that [testing [facilities]{.mark} are ready and
[can be used **immediately**]{.mark}]{.underline} \'if the order is
given\'.

Rear Admiral Andrei Sinitsyn said: [\'The test site is ready [to resume
**full-scale testing**]{.mark} activities]{.underline}\... The
laboratory and testing facilities are ready. The personnel are ready.

Sinitsyn claimed \'foreign intelligence\' was monitoring the site,
[[\'likely sign of]{.mark} a [**concern** over **nuclear
tests\'**]{.mark}]{.underline}, speaking to the state-owned Rossiyskaya
Gazeta.

\'We are constantly ready to repel all types of threats, including the
penetration of sabotage and reconnaissance groups onto the island,\' he
said.

Mr Sinitsyn said that \'the \'Central Test Site of the Russian
Federation\' would be used for \'conducting and providing non-nuclear
explosive experiments\'.

He said the [[tests were \'in]{.mark} the [interests of **state
security\'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But pressed on whether the site was ready to \'if necessary, resume
nuclear testing\', he said: [\'The testing ground is [ready to resume
**full-scale testing**]{.mark} activities. Ready in full]{.underline}.\'

If an order is given by Vladimir Putin, a test may still go ahead.

The site has not been used for nuclear testing since October 1990, after
which the ailing USSR ruled out future tests, maintained by Russia.

Images obtained by the Middlebury Institute for International Studies
last year showed an uptick in construction at the remote island
location, RFE reported at the time.

A comparison of imagery from July 2021 and June 2023 showed large
trucks, construction cranes, shipping containers and building supplies
brought in to the settlement for its expansion.

Mr Sinitsyn said the main priorities, and raison d\'être for the site,
were to deter perceived aggressors through the \'readiness\' of testing
ground infrastructure.

He said this included maintaining a \'laboratory\' and \'experimental
base\', both of which are \'ready\'.

\'The testing ground has the appropriate staff, weapons, equipment, that
is, everything that is necessary for our activities,\' he said.

#### The plan solves:

#### 1. [DOMAIN AWARENESS]{.underline}. Only increasing the presence of [sensor infrastructure]{.underline} allows for sufficient [threat detection]{.underline} and [response]{.underline}.

2\) Arctic domain awareness

[[The US and]{.mark} the Arctic 7 **[critically lack]{.mark}**
comprehensive [aerial, maritime, and situational **domain
awareness**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}. In simple terms, [the
lack of eyes and ears means **gaps**]{.underline}. Yet [domain awareness
is [key to **anticipating**]{.mark} current **[threats]{.mark}** and
**predicting** future ones]{.underline} in a region characterized by
vast distance, complex geography, and harsh climate.

The Arctic 7 has largely acknowledged and identified existing domain
awareness gaps and the need for increased capabilities on both sides of
the launch.134 First, more [situational awareness capabilities are
**required** such as **radars** and tracking and **forecasting** remote
sensors. These assets will also be **instrumental** for]{.underline}
search-and-rescue operations, [environmental
**protection**]{.underline}, [and **climate change**
mitigation]{.underline}.77

[Second, **[C5ISR]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Command, Control,
Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and
Reconnaissance) [capabilities [will]{.mark} help [improve
**communication**]{.mark}, positioning, [and
**navigation**]{.mark}]{.underline} across the region. Such capabilities
will also be used for civilian operations such as search and rescue.

Finally, [domain [awareness rests on]{.mark} better left-of-launch
**[threat detection]{.mark}** and tracking]{.underline}.134 With the
introduction in the US of the concept of missile defeat,135 [modern
**[early detection]{.mark}** and **remote sensing** capabilities [are
needed to]{.mark} **better [identify]{.mark}** and target [adversary
**launch**]{.mark} complexes before **missile launch**]{.underline}.

As part of multidomain threat detection, [comprehensive domain
[awareness must take place across **all domains**]{.mark}:]{.underline}

> [**[Aerial]{.mark}** surveillance]{.underline} --- notably [with
> maritime **patrol aircraft** rotations]{.underline}, NATO Air Policing
> missions in Iceland, and the deployment of F-35 fighter jets in
> Norway, Greenland, and Finland136
>
> [**[Maritime]{.mark}** domain awareness]{.underline} --- for instance,
> [surface and subsurface **[sensors]{.mark}** for seabed warfare
> **threat detection** and Arctic underwater **listening
> posts**]{.underline}
>
> [[**Space-based** assets]{.mark} for missile **warning** and
> **observation**]{.underline}
>
> [**Cyber** domain]{.underline} and across the electromagnetic spectrum

Better domain awareness must also happen jointly between the Arctic/NATO
7 and their partners. Individually, the Arctic 7 possess highly
developed capabilities but often lack the capacity to seamlessly share
data and consequently achieve full circumpolar awareness. This will
therefore require increased intelligence sharing and interagency
cooperation. Ultimately, the goal is to reach full seabed-to-space
circumpolar awareness with multidomain data fusion; intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and networks of overlapping
sensors.137

Like elsewhere, [[the alliance]{.mark} and its allies [must retain its
**advantage**]{.mark} over **time**, **space**, and
**info**rmation]{.underline} --- especially considering how complicated
the environment is. Overall, NATO must find a proper "speed of
relevancy" in the Arctic. In this, [[leveraging]{.mark} modern
**[tech]{.mark}**nology [is **critical** to]{.mark} achieving
comprehensive **[domain awareness]{.mark}** and]{.underline} enhancing
common [knowledge of future **Arctic challenges**]{.underline}.

#### 2. [REMOTE ACCESS]{.underline}. It's [crucial]{.underline} for continual access and [monitoring]{.underline}.

3\) Is remote access the future of Arctic presence?

As part of discussions on domain awareness in the Arctic, [[another
aspect of]{.mark} the debate on modern **[tech]{.mark}**nology
[is]{.mark} to assess the balance between physical [**human presence**
and **remote access**]{.mark}]{.underline} through uncrewed platforms
and autonomous systems in a changing Arctic. Under the impact of climate
change, year-round, ice-free access to the Central Arctic Ocean will not
happen for several decades.

By mid-century and beyond, [uncrewed and **[autonomous
tech]{.mark}**nology, [boosted by]{.mark} the recent
**[a]{.mark}**]{.underline}rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence [revolution, [might be the
**best solution**]{.mark}]{.underline} for commercial, civilian, and
military operators [[to ensure **remote presence** and]{.mark} overall
**[domain awareness]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}. If sovereignty
enforcement will continue to require constant human presence, [certain
[operations might be **entirely devoted** to]{.mark} modern **[remote
systems]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Climate change will completely disrupt coastlines across the Arctic,
leading to a form of depopulation --- especially for Indigenous
communities. Yet Arctic communities represent the best domain awareness
possible: direct human intelligence and acute local knowledge. In this,
decreased human presence across the region might give more opportunities
for nefarious state-based activities. In other words, climate
change--induced Arctic depopulation represents an additional threat to
domain awareness.

[[Finding the]{.mark} **appropriate [balance]{.mark}** between human
presence and remote access [will inform]{.mark}]{.underline} US and NATO
[**[procurement]{.mark}** requirements for future Arctic operations [in
key]{.mark} technology **[sectors]{.mark}**]{.underline} for domain
awareness and beyond.

#### 3. [SATELLITES]{.underline}. They're [necessary]{.underline} for tracking military movements, but the U.S. is [lagging]{.underline}.

Space capabilities

[[**Space-based** surveillance]{.mark} capabilities [are
**integral**]{.mark} to domain awareness. [The US is]{.mark} generally
[**lacking Arctic-specific** space
**capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The situation is [[**compounded**
by]{.mark} the region's [high **latitude**, **provoking**]{.mark}
coverage [**gaps**, as well as]{.mark} unique **[electromagnetic
disruptions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.134

Today, [[spatial resolution]{.mark} with current satellites [is **high
enough** to **track**]{.mark} and monitor **[movements]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. What is lacking, however, is increased resolution
and year-round high-resolution imagery. In this context, **[[synthetic
aperture radar]{.underline}]{.mark}** (SAR) imaging onboard satellites
[[offers]{.mark} an innovative technology for [greater **resolution**
and]{.mark} near-real-time **[imagery]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
technology has become [[**paramount** for]{.mark} polar observation,
navigation, and overall [Arctic ISR]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[SAR allows **seeing through** thick Arctic **cloud coverage**, an
important feature for low Earth orbit circumpolar
observation]{.underline}. SAR represents a booming technology, primarily
carried by private companies, especially from Arctic nations such as
Finland's ICEYE.138 In the coming decades, quantum computing will offer
solutions for ground-based space stations and satellite antennas.

[[Satellite technology is **paramount** for]{.mark} Arctic
communications and **[connectivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many projects
are at play, such as the new polar Enhanced Satellite Communication
Project funded by Canada139 and the recent arrival of Starlink for basic
connectivity in the Arctic. The recent signature of a partnership
between the US and Norway to jointly launch and deploy polar-dedicated
satellites is another positive step forward.140

On top of space-based assets, ground stations will also have to be
upgraded to download the exponential data traffic. In the future,
[[ground **stations** might be entirely **replaced** by **satellite
relays**]{.mark} directly embedded]{.underline} in the satellite
constellations. [[More **satellites**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} more
**[launchpads]{.mark}** for satellites, [will be **necessary**]{.mark}
as well as better constellation and debris management]{.underline}
across Earth's orbits.141

More competition with China in space is inevitable, especially as
Beijing develops optical satellite architecture for polar operations and
seeks to increase the amount of ground-based infrastructure in polar
regions.142

#### 4. [AUTOMATION]{.underline}.

Uncrewed platforms and autonomous systems

[The integration of **[uncrewed platforms]{.mark}** equipped [for
**Arctic operations** will]{.mark} likely [grow
**exponentially**]{.mark} in the coming decades]{.underline}. Modern
[capabilities will include [fleets of]{.mark}]{.underline} aerial
(**[[UAV]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and underwater
(**[[UUV]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [uncrewed vehicles that will be used
[for tracking]{.mark}, navigation and [fleet **management**, **domain
awareness**]{.mark} and ISR, [and]{.mark} the [**protection** of
critical **undersea infrastructure**]{.mark} and other
assets]{.underline}. The exact degree of autonomy of these systems
remains up for debate.

Moving forward, [UAVs and UUVs will be [equipped with **sensors** for
**early-warning**]{.mark} detection [and]{.mark} more offensive systems,
notably **[electronic countermeasures]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Considerable investment **remains to be made**]{.mark} to operate
fleets of UAVs in the Arctic]{.underline} --- not least because of
network and communication issues, as outlined by NORAD and NORTHCOM
Commander General Glen D. VanHerck.143

[[Experts have been **calling** for a **rotational UAV**
presence]{.mark} in the Arctic [to boost **domain
awareness**]{.mark}]{.underline} across NORAD's and NORTHCOM AoRs and
beyond.134 [This represents a **sound** and **achievable** first step
that should be closely considered]{.underline}. The rest of the Arctic 7
should also follow suit. A first step in this direction is the
announcement by Norway in April 2024 that it will turn the Andøya Air
Station into a base for long-range drones for domain awareness as part
of a multinational endeavor.144

Overall, [future [procurement]{.mark} of Arctic capabilities and
platforms [requires that **deployed tech**]{.mark}nologies [are]{.mark}
cold weather and [Arctic enabled by **design**]{.mark} rather than by
default]{.underline}.36 This will require adaptations in military
research and development and procurement to determine what makes a
specific asset "Arctic specific."

Another part of the debate is the balance between deployed systems into
the Arctic and assets remaining there year-round. The deployment of more
assets in Arctic conditions will require better winterizing solutions
--- mostly bases and infrastructure development and modernization across
Arctic allies.145

Ultimately, however, the role and place of modern Arctic-specific
technology will be determined by political and budgetary constraints
more than anything else. The US and the Arctic 7 will have to craft
smart investment plans, increase capabilities sharing, and pool
resources.

What really makes [the [Arctic]{.mark} important]{.underline} from a
geopolitical perspective [is **the** threat]{.underline} it poses [to
[**ecospheric** security]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} is a
[**conception** of security]{.underline} that [has **yet** to make its
way into]{.underline} the mainstream [even]{.underline} of
[**non**-traditional security discourse]{.underline}.8 The
[ecosphere]{.underline} is that part of the Earth that does (or could)
support life, and its [health [depends crucially upon **atmospheric
homeostasis**]{.mark} and]{.underline} adequate
[[biodiversity]{.underline}]{.mark}---[the **latter**]{.underline} of
which, according to prominent climate scientists, [[may be a
**precondition** ]{.mark}**for** the former]{.underline} (Lovelock and
Margulis 1974, 1--9). At no time in known history has the planet
experienced a more rapid rise in greenhouse gases or a faster increase
in mean surface temperature. True, it has been hotter at times and the
atmosphere has borne more carbon; but the crucial consideration is the
rate of change. An elastic band will stretch much farther without
breaking if pulled slowly, but [we are stretching atmospheric
chemistry]{.underline} at an unprecedented rate as a result of fossil
fuel emissions. The Arctic is relevant here because [[vast
quantities]{.mark} of]{.underline} powerful greenhouse gases---carbon
dioxide and [[methane]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular---[are [locked
up in **permafrost**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A rapidly warming Arctic has
[the potential to shift from a **net** carbon sink to a net carbon
source]{.underline}, (Voigt et al. 2017, 3121--3138; Schaefer et al.
2011, 165--180) accelerate warming worldwide, increase the frequency and
severity of wildfires (which in turn are powerful causes of warming;
Mooney 2013) increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events in other climate zones; Greene and Monger 2012, 7--9), and both
[[alter]{.underline}]{.mark} and amplify [[global climate
**feedbacks**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sommerkorn and Hassol 2009).

Less ominous than ecospheric catastrophe, but still of concern on a
scale that dwarfs any of the local security challenges facing the
Arctic, is [sea-level rise]{.underline} caused by polar warming (Rignot
et al. 2011, 1--5; Hansen and Sato 2012; Kinnard et al. 2011, 509-U231;
Livina and Lenton 2013, 275--286; Levermann et al. 2013, 13745--13750).
Arctic sea ice is not a major issue here, except as regards (a) thermal
expansion and (b) the effect of salinity dilution on heat transport
mechanisms; but the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps are, as both
currently sit on land and are not at the moment displacing their own
weight in water. Estimates of the mean global sea-level rise that we can
expect as a result of polar icecap melting are, of course, uncertain,
but even a relatively modest rise [will]{.underline} swamp island states
such as Vanuatu and the Maldives wholesale, and will [disproportionately
affect]{.underline} Asia, the most populous continent
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[the engine of the **global
economy**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Schleussner et al. 2018, 135--163;
Woodruff et al. 2018, 48--77; Islam and Khan 2018, 297--323; Vitousek
2017).

[The Arctic is]{.underline} not itself a site of interesting
geopolitical value; but it has enormous, generally unappreciated
geopolitical value to non-Arctic regions both as a proverbial canary in
a coal mine and as [a potential climate change **time
bomb**]{.underline} in its own right. Ironically, [if we do
not]{.underline} find a way to [wean ourselves off carbon, [the Arctic
**may**]{.mark}]{.underline} itself actually [[**become** one of the few
remaining places on the planet **capable** of
sustaining]{.underline}]{.mark} human
**[[habitation]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Hansen et al. 2013, 1--31; Morgan
2009, 683--693; Lovelock 2006a, b). Needless to say, there is no
Arctic-governance fix to this. It is a global problem requiring an
urgent, concerted global solution---a problem for which traditional
geopolitical lenses and [[traditional geopolitical **rivalries**
are]{.mark}]{.underline} pointless distractions, and for this very
reason [[serious **security threats**]{.underline}]{.mark} in and of
themselves.

**[Catastrophic consequences for civilization]{.underline}**. The
[consequences of this rapid pruning]{.underline} [of the evolutionary
tree of life extend beyond the obvious]{.underline}. [There could be
**surprising effects**]{.underline} [of biodiversity loss]{.underline}
[that scientists are **unable to**]{.underline} fully [**anticipate** in
advance]{.underline}. For example, prior research has shown that
[**[localized]{.mark}** [ecosystems]{.mark} [can undergo **abrupt and
irreversible shifts**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[when they reach a tipping
point]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to a 2012 paper published in
Nature, there are reasons for thinking that **[we may be approaching a
tipping point]{.underline}** of this sort **[[in the global
ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [beyond which the [consequences could
be **catastrophic**]{.mark} for civilization]{.underline}. As the
authors write, **[[a]{.mark} planetary-scale [transition could
precipitate]{.mark}]{.underline}** "[[substantial losses of **ecosystem
services** **required**]{.mark} [to **sustain**]{.mark} [the human

process that benefits humanity, such as food production and crop

"**[widespread]{.mark} [social unrest, economic instability, and loss of
human life]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}" According to Missouri
Botanical Garden ecologist Adam Smith, one of the paper's co-authors,
[[this could occur]{.mark} in]{.underline} a matter of
**[decades]{.underline}**---**[far more [quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}[**than** most of the expected consequences of **climate
change**]{.underline}, **[yet equally destructive]{.underline}**.
[[Biodiversity loss is a "**threat multiplier**]{.mark}"]{.underline}
that, [by [pushing societies to]{.mark} the brink of
[collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[will exacerbate]{.mark} existing
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and introduce]{.mark} entirely
**[new struggles]{.mark}** between state and non-state
actors]{.underline}. Indeed, **[[it]{.mark} [could]{.mark} even [fuel

has been linked to the emergence of ISIS in Syria, and multiple
high-ranking US officials, such as former US Defense Secretary Chuck
Hagel and CIA director John Brennan, have affirmed that climate change
and terrorism are connected.) The reality is that **[we are entering the
sixth mass extinction]{.underline}** in the 3.8-billion-year history of
life on Earth, and **[the impact of this event could be felt by
civilization]{.underline}** "in as little as three human lifetimes," as
the aforementioned 2012 Nature paper notes. Furthermore, the [widespread
[decline of biological populations]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} plausibly **[[initiate]{.mark} a [dramatic

[is that [biodiversity]{.mark} [loss]{.mark}]{.underline} [[constitutes

Since 2014, there has been very little contact between the US and
Russian governments. In March of that year, in response to Russian
actions in Ukraine, President Obama took a series of punitive steps,
including the imposition of targeted sanctions through Executive Order
13660. The initial round of sanctions has since been expanded through
additional orders. Among other targets, the sanctions specifically
included the Russian Arctic oil sector. The Arctic sanctions led to
embarrassment for then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had, as CEO
of Exxon Mobil, concluded agreements with Igor Sechin, the head of
Rosneft, for joint ventures in the Kara Sea that violated the sanctions
regime. Exxon was fined \$2 million by the Treasury Department in 2017
and in 2018 pulled out of the project, taking a \$200 million loss
(Rappeport 2017). The specific inclusion of Arctic projects in the
sanctions regime, along with the highly-visible flap over Secretary
Tillerson and Exxon's deals with Rosneft, threw an unusually strong
spotlight on US-Russian relations in the Arctic region. In the [[Bering
Strait]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, the shared maritime border means
that some interaction is still necessary. The
[[government-government]{.mark} contact]{.underline} across the Bering
Strait in recent years [has been]{.underline} confined to clearly
mandated missions. Areas of shared interest are clear: fisheries
concerns dominate, and **[closely related]{.underline}** concerns
relating [to]{.underline} maritime safety and [environmental
**[stewardship]{.mark}**]{.underline} are also of evident importance.
Serghei Golunov (2016) describes the geographical proximity of the
United States and Russia across the Bering Strait as "highly relative"
and highly variable to changing perceptions and circumstances. While
political factors and economic conditions affect perceptions of
proximity, Golunov also argues that [the [difficulties
]{.mark}]{.underline}inherent in US-Russian proximity---including the
maritime border, and the climate and infrastructure hurdles---[[require
an **extra step**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In order to be workable and
exploited fully, US-Russian proximity requires "the willingness and
opportunities of certain actors to cooperate." The history of Russia-US
relations across the shared maritime border in the Bering Strait
reflects the variability Golunov describes. In addition, formal
government-government relations have frequently been much different from
informal connections between communities in the region. However,
proximity to the border (as well as distance from the respective
capitols and centers of government authority) has also served [[to
facilitate]{.underline}]{.mark} grassroots activism aimed at altering
government relations. The special aspects of a shared maritime border
lend another dimension to the complex and shifting tenor of Russia-US
relations in the Bering Strait region. Without fixed border
installations, and systems of infrastructure linking the two countries
like road and rail connections, the border is less tangible and
seemingly permeable. As one local inhabitant described it, "We do not
know exactly where the line is, where the border is. It is sort of
tempting; do you understand?" (Griffith 1975). The absence of a physical
border, and [[the flow of marine life]{.underline}]{.mark} all around
and through the Bering Strait, lends an element of surrealism only
heightened by the extreme political swings: from postrevolutionary
suspicion to the desperate partnership in war; then again to Cold War
acrimony, followed by the 1990s thaw in relations---followed once more
by rising tension in recent years. Throughout the decades of drastic
change, maritime authorities have been at the front lines of official
contact and cooperation. The coast/border guards at sea, and the
constellation of fisheries and environmental scientists and managers
beyond, have sustained US-Russian relations in the Bering Strait region
through political turmoil. [[As both]{.underline}]{.mark} countries
[[prepare for a new wave of upheaval]{.underline}]{.mark} linked to both
a changing climate and increasing human activity, these frontline
authorities should be given the tools and latitude to advance
cooperation and stewardship across the region. Although [[the
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark} between Russia and the United States
[[is at a **modern low point**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the shared
interests present in the Bering Strait region---including sustainable
and controlled fisheries, environmental stewardship, and safety of life
at sea---are enduring. [[**Any** diminishment in
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in these areas [[will only
harm]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}, now and
in the future. [[**Conversely, growing cooperation**
may]{.underline}]{.mark} offer room for positive
[[improve]{.underline}]{.mark}ments in influencing [[Russian positions
and behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the circumpolar perspective, the
cross-border cooperation that seems so astonishing between Russia and
the US is less remarkable. The strength of cultural ties between
communities around the Arctic has supported enduring cooperative
relationships at the local level, which often cross international
borders. For example, the subnational governments of Nunavut (Canada)
and Greenland (Denmark) have had a long and robust relationship centered
on shared heritage and common interests across their shared maritime
border. Close cooperative ties also exist across land borders: the
Nordic Sámi Convention is a governance initiative representing the
interests of Sámi people in Norway, Sweden, and Finland, where national
borders cut through the traditional areas inhabited by the Sámi people.
However, [[the US-Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} example in the
[[Bering]{.underline}]{.mark} region is an important marker for
cross-border cooperation in the Arctic. As human activity increases in
the Bering Strait, the stakes for [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}
will grow even higher. The Bering Strait [[is a **fulcrum
point**]{.underline}]{.mark} where national and local levels of
interests, diplomacy, and security interact and collide. As traffic
increases, both US and Russian authorities in the region will face
increasing pressure [[to hold]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[complex
tensions in balance]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Connector and Corridor [[The Bering]{.underline}]{.mark} Strait is an
important [[migration corridor]{.underline}]{.mark} for a huge variety
of species; in addition, it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} an important
channel for water from the Pacific Ocean to flow in the Arctic basin.
Water flowing northwards through the Bering Strait carries nutrients
that upwell off the continental shelf in the northern Pacific,
[[supporting]{.underline}]{.mark} rich [[primary]{.underline}]{.mark}
and [[**secondary** productivity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Scientists point
to this flux of **[[nutrient-rich]{.underline}]{.mark}** water through
the Bering Strait as explanation for the incredibly high biological
productivity of the Bering and Chukchi [[Seas]{.underline}]{.mark},
which, in spring and summer, "[[rival]{.underline}]{.mark} those of
[[**any** location in the]{.underline}]{.mark} world
[[ocean]{.underline}]{.mark}" and remain higher than any other part of
the Arctic year-round (Cooper et al. 2006). Research suggests that
northward flow through the Bering Strait acts [[as "a
conduit"]{.underline}]{.mark} for warm water into the Arctic that may
play an important role in overall Arctic warming (Woodgate et al. 2010).
The high primary productivity of the Bering Strait [[makes the region an
"ecological hotspot of **global proportions**]{.underline}]{.mark},"
according to Audubon Alaska, including birds, whales, seals, walrus, and
fish. A huge variety of species travel to the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea
area in the summer to take advantage of the explosion of productivity
that occurs in the Arctic summer. "[[Because the Strait is the **only
passage** between]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Pacific and
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} Oceans, [[**all**
wildlife]{.underline}]{.mark} that live in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas
in the summer months [[funnel through]{.mark} the Bering
Strait]{.underline} twice each year [[during]{.underline}]{.mark} spring
and fall migration" (Audubon). In particular, "one of [[the
largest]{.underline}]{.mark} marine [[migrations]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the world" takes place each year as marine mammals and birds travel
along the eastern side of the Bering Strait and along the Chukchi Sea
coast (Pew). Martin Robards of the Wildlife Conservation Society
describes this migration as "one of the great wonders of our planet,"
and observes that, "there is no getting around the sheer immensity of
this movement of marine mammals back and forth through the international
waters" between Chukotka and Alaska (Robards 2017). Because of its
importance to a wide variety of species, [[including
**fragile**]{.underline}]{.mark} populations of migratory [[birds
and]{.underline}]{.mark} marine [[mammals]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
return to the same areas to feed and reproduce each year, and are
therefore vulnerable if those areas are damaged, the Bering Strait
region is a focus of advocacy and protection efforts for some of the
most prominent environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the
world. In support of their advocacy efforts, leading NGOs have
frequently served as intermediaries between Russian and American
governments.

### 1AC - Advantage -- Arctic Shipping

**Arctic shipping is coming, US military is not ready**

Since 2009, the US has issued several Arctic policy documents. The 2009
Arctic Region Policy Directive marked a significant shift in US
assessment by recognizing the Arctic's importance, particularly in terms
of energy and security.6) [[The 2013 National Strategy for the Arctic
Region highlighted energy and US security, environmental preservation,
freedom of navigation, access to resources, commerce protection, and
peaceful resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}.7)

[[The 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region was more
urgent]{.underline}]{.mark}. Marie-Anne Coninsx, a senior fellow at the
Egmont Institute and former EU Ambassador (Arctic), noted that in prior
years, US Arctic commitment was "not high on the US Federal Agenda."8)
[[The Strategy marked a shift in US policy, acknowledging the Arctic as
a critical and addressing challenges that had emerged since
2013]{.underline}]{.mark}. It identified four key Pillars: security,
climate change/protection, sustainable development, and international
governance.9) The strategy emphasized climate change and investing in
sustainable development while increasing capabilities to prevent threats
to the US and its allies.10) Furthermore, it recognized the heightened
strategic competition in the Arctic, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of
Ukraine.11) In 2023, US Army General VanHerck advocated to Congress the
urgent need for a focused Arctic Strategy, enhanced domain awareness,
and the creation of a comprehensive defense framework as these
challenges were being driven further by advancing climate change and
rising security challenges.12)

The 2024 Department of Defense (DoD) Arctic Strategy further recognizes
the Arctic's growing importance due to climate change, geopolitical
shifts, and increasing great-power competition and directs the DoD to
"enhance its Arctic capabilities, deepen engagement with Allies and
partners, and exercise our forces to build readiness for operations at
high latitudes."13) It highlights critical defense objectives, including
protecting US sovereignty, maintaining stability, and ensuring the
Arctic's role as a secure avenue for power projection. The 2024 Strategy
includes specific initiatives such as enhanced domain awareness;
increased communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
capabilities; better understanding of cold-weather operations; and
conducting key routine training alongside US allies to strengthen joint
capabilities.14) The strategy emphasizes cooperation with, and
participation of, Arctic nations and Indigenous communities. It
underscores climate adaptation measures. Through these efforts, the DoD
seeks to maintain a "monitor-and-respond" posture, ensuring the Arctic
remains peaceful while adapting to dynamic environmental and security
conditions.

Climate change and security

[[Climate change has rapidly transformed the Arctic, making previously
inaccessible areas more available for economic and strategic use. The
North Sea Route]{.underline}]{.mark} (NSR) [[and the Northwest
Passage]{.underline}]{.mark} (NWP) [[could become economically viable by
2023]{.underline}]{.mark},15) potentially diverting traffic from the
Suez Canal. [[As access to critical resources expands, states will shift
strategies and intensify competition over the Arctic's growing
economic]{.underline}]{.mark} and military
[[significance]{.underline}]{.mark}. This competition has also been
driven by its militarization.16) Over the past decade, Russia has
modernized its Arctic military bases, deployed defense missiles, and
upgraded its submarine fleet while developing fisheries, petroleum, and
mineral extraction.17) Russia's restrictive NSR claims have further
escalated tensions, especially following its invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, PRC signaled growing ambitions having ramped up its Arctic
investments, researched military applications, and expanded its
icebreaker fleet.18) These developments highlight the Arctic's evolving
role in economic opportunity and strategic rivalry, posing significant
challenges to US grand strategy.

American Grand Strategy

The 2009 Arctic Region Policy shifted away from the apathetic post-Cold
War US Arctic strategy, recognizing the Arctic as an emerging critical
region but only identified two focal points: energy and security.19) The
2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region was comprehensive,
addressing the Pillars of security, climate change/environmental
protection, sustainable development, and international governance.
Changes in the physical, financial, and geopolitical landscape have
shifted American grand strategy in the Arctic, ending the previous three
decades of stability following the Cold War and reflecting rising
geopolitical tensions between Russia and Arctic stakeholders.

Energy

[[The US is vested in the Arctic's oil and natural
gas]{.underline}]{.mark}, with Alaska's Prudhoe Bay Oil Field being
North America's most prominent; in the 2000s, Prudhoe Bay typically
produced about 8% of America's domestic oil.20) [[The importance of
Arctic oil to America's energy independence was demonstrated in 2006
when a leak in a critical pipeline at Prudhoe Bay]{.underline}]{.mark}
forced the line's shutdown while the US and Iran were in a dispute. At
the same time, tensions in the Middle East made it difficult for the US
to buy reasonably priced foreign oil. The total cost of oil increased 3%
domestically.21)

The 2009 Arctic Region Policy aimed to increase US oil independence by
accessing Alaskan oil deposits. While it received support from energy
independence advocates, it was also met with resistance from
environmentalists, thus hindering implementation.22) This debate
persisted over the years, shaping subsequent approaches to Arctic
resource development. The Trump administration (2021) issued drilling
leases on more than 400,000 acres in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.23) In contrast, [[the 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic
acknowledges the region's economic reliance on hydrocarbon production
while advocating for economic diversification, a transition to green
energy and environmental protection]{.underline}]{.mark}.24) In 2024,
the US Department of the Interior denied commercial access to a copper
deposit through Gates of the Arctic National Park. It banned oil
drilling in half of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.25)
Environmentalists and tribal leaders praised these decisions, but
Alaska's officials criticized them.26)

The relationship between environmentalism and energy complicates the US
grand strategy in the Arctic, creating inconsistency due to fluctuating
politics, public opinion, and stakeholder support. This makes long-term
planning for Arctic energy difficult, as leadership changes can shift
priorities between resource extraction and environmental protections and
alter the trajectory of US Arctic strategy. Such volatility hampers
coherent, long-term policies essential for the region's energy security
and ecological sustainability, making it a contentious issue influenced
by electoral outcomes and shifting public opinion.

Security

The 2009 US Arctic Region Policy's focus on security has evolved
significantly. Previously, the US emphasized unilateral security and
preferred bilateral agreements to regional cooperation while ignoring
Arctic issues.27) Post-Cold War, Russia expanded its presence in the
Arctic, reverting to Cold War norms. In response, the 2022 National
Strategy now prioritizes American people and sovereign territory and
rights, committing to enhance capabilities through infrastructure
improvements, including an expanded icebreaker fleet, and strengthening
cooperation with Arctic allies against Russian aggression.28)

In his 1987 Murmansk speech, Mikhail Gorbachev described the Arctic as a
"peace and cooperation zone," emphasizing collaboration over
competition.29) However during the 2000s, in response to an increased
perception of NATO's Arctic presence and strategic importance, Russia
began militarizing the region, seeking to reclaim its superpower status
after the Soviet Union's collapse.30) By 2019, Russia had established 14
airfields, six military bases, refurbished 16 Soviet-era deep-water
ports, and 10 border posts in the Arctic, with its Northern Fleet
boasting an estimated 120 ships, including 40 icebreakers.31) Russia
allowed PRC to construct docks at five of the most significant ports
along Russia's Arctic coastline.32) In contrast, the US needs to develop
a centralized command structure in the Arctic, a crucial aspect of its
security policy.33) It has only one significant base at Pituffik Space
Base in Greenland, with two additional bases south of the Arctic Circle
in Alaska.34) The US has only two ocean-going icebreakers. There is a
stark disparity in military presence between Russia and the US, a
potential security dilemma. Russia's action, and the US's inaction,
underscore the Arctic's strategic importance and the urgency for a
comprehensive security strategy.

Russia has fortified the region to protect future strategic and economic
interests.35) The US has interpreted this as an attempt to achieve
regional dominance, prompting numerous military operations in the
area.36) Moscow views US actions as aggressive intrusions into Russian
territory, which has led to further militarization on both sides.37)

This ongoing dynamic was exemplified when US Vice Admiral Lewis claimed
that his fleet was prepared to secure sea lanes in the Atlantic and
Arctic.38) A Russian Duma member responded by stating that the US should
not tempt fate and that the NSR and Arctic were Russia's responsibility
where Russian national interests are present.39) The current US Grand
Strategy has acted firmly but lacks consistent messaging. For example,
in 2019, Secretary of State Pompeo decried Russian aggression in the
Arctic, citing their regulations on NSR shipping, Arctic fortification,
and actions in Ukraine.40) However, Pompeo's message lacked specificity
about why the US felt threatened, simply stating that the US would host
military exercises and increase its presence in the Arctic.41) The US
must ensure that its actions in the Arctic are firm, predictable,
consistent, and straightforward to avoid further escalating tensions.

The US must improve its messaging on Arctic security by clearly
communicating its policies and red lines to Russia to avoid
misinterpretations and unintended confrontations. However, it's also
important to recognize that the Arctic offers opportunities for
cooperation. Enhanced communication can address immediate threats and
foster stable regional collaboration. By improving its messaging
strategy, the US can more effectively navigate the complex geopolitical
landscape and reduce the risks of escalating tensions with Russia.

Economics

[[The future of the American Grand Strategy will be influenced by
accessibility of the NSR and NWP]{.underline}]{.mark}, which has
historically been limited due to short operational seasons (sea ice,
weather) and limited infrastructure. [[These routes
are]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[becoming viable with the NSR's
navigation season expected to extend from three to six months and the
NWP's from two to four months by 2100]{.underline}]{.mark}.42) [[If
these projections hold, transporting goods from Europe to the Far East
via the NSR could be 25 percent more profitable]{.underline}]{.mark}
than the Suez Canal Route.43)

[[The current shipping industry is already challenged. In 2023, Houthi
attacks in the Red Sea led seven major shipping companies to alter their
routes, resulting in fewer ships using the Suez
Canal]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile, severe [[drought in Panama caused
a 30 percent decrease in trade since November
2023]{.underline}]{.mark}.44) These disruptions have led to a 283
percent increase in the cost of a 40-foot container transiting from PRC
to northern Europe.45) [[These challenges have highlighted the need for
alternative shipping routes, making the Arctic routes increasingly
important]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The future accessibility of the Arctic makes it more critical than
ever however, the West's investment is lagging]{.underline}]{.mark}.46)
In contrast, [[Russia has prioritized the development of the Arctic to
attract traffic, particularly the NSR]{.underline}]{.mark}. From 2011 to
2015, the Russian Arctic doctrine focused on establishing new ports,
customs facilities, and marine checkpoints along the Arctic
Coastline.47) Vladimir Putin has stressed the NSR's strategic
importance, and Russia's development plan for 2035 includes \$19 billion
in infrastructure investments.48) These commitments underscore Russia's
recognition of the value of the NSR and the potential increase in cargo
transport in the north.

The development of the NSR is also of interest to PRC, who referred to
it as part of the Polar Silk Road in its 2018 Arctic White Paper and the
14th Five-Year Plan.49) Putin's 2023 visit to PRC aimed to enhance the
NSR's integration into the Belt and Road Initiative.50) PRC's NSR use
has steadily increased, with transits rising from 27 in 2018 to 62 in
2020.51) The economic benefits, predicted to be 25 % greater than those
of the Suez Canal Route, are also a significant driver of PRC's growing
NSR interest.52) PRC stands to gain significantly from Russian NSR, and
Arctic expansion, in general.

In contrast, Europe and Japan have a more complicated view of the NSR.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there was a decline in NSR
transit due to sanctions on Russia.53) However, by 2023, transits had
rebounded, with increased transport of Russian LNG to Europe.54) Despite
condemning Russia's actions, Japan has not avoided the NSR, indicating
that economic advantages often outweigh political considerations.

[[Shifting maritime traffic from the Suez Canal to the NSR requires the
US to reevaluate trade routes]{.underline}]{.mark} and competitive
strategies. As European and Asian partners increasingly use the NSR,
they will need to maintain good relations with Russia, which could limit
their willingness to oppose Russia, giving Russia a strategic advantage.
[[The US must consider this shift in geopolitical power while also
closely monitoring the growing partnership between Russia and the PRC in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Increased access to energy and mineral resources extraction due to ice
melt, holds significant capacity for growth.]{.underline}]{.mark}55)
[[The area is home to 22 percent of the world's resources, which
includes up to 25 percent of unexplored oil and gas
reserves]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite having no Arctic land, PRC refers
to itself as a "near Arctic state," investing heavily in the region. In
2012, PRC invested \$12 billion in the Russian Yamal LNG project after
US sanctions left Russia short on funds.56)

Furthermore, in 2018, PRC signed an agreement to invest in Alaskan
natural gas export facility,57) and in 2019, Chinese companies purchased
10 percent (\$5.6 billion) of the most prominent Russian natural gas
producer.58) PRC has unsuccessfully attempted to buy mines in Nunavut59)
and recently increased research and land acquisition efforts in the
Svalbard.60) PRC is clearly committed to Arctic resources.

[[The Arctic's growing accessibility is changing global trade and
economics, necessitating an adaptation of US grand
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Considering the potential opportunities
and challenges posed by Russia's and China's growing commercial
influence, [[the Arctic will play a crucial role in future global trade,
resource extraction, and international relations, making it a key
consideration for American strategic planning]{.underline}]{.mark}.

New Trade Routes, New Economic Opportunity

[[The Arctic region has been warming four times faster than the rest of
the world over the past four decades]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
a 2022 study by Finnish and Norwegian scientists. Scientists are
projecting that [[by 2035, parts of the Arctic will be free of ice
during summer months, opening up prospects for commercial shipping to
ply these waters and shorten transit time between the U.S., Europe and
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some studies project that [[Arctic routes
could be 30% to 50% shorter than the Suez Canal and Panama Canal routes,
with transit time reduced by an estimated 14 to 20
days]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beyond commercial shipping, the new routes
could attract cruise ships and adventure tourists.

[[Access not only creates opportunities for the maritime sector, but the
region is rich in fossil fuels, critical minerals and marine
life]{.underline}]{.mark}. Commercial industries potentially will gain
access to billions of dollars of untapped resources. Unlike Antarctica,
a land mass, [[there is no treaty protecting the Arctic from
international development.]{.underline}]{.mark} This makes control over
the waterways and natural resources ripe for dispute and potential
conflict. The race to build infrastructure to support and control
navigation has already begun.

Northern Sea Route, Northwest Passage and Future Trans-Arctic Shipping
Route

[[The Northern Sea Route]{.underline}]{.mark} (NSR) was first opened by
the Soviet Union in the 1930s but [[has not been a reliable transit
route due to ice coverage. Climate change is changing
that]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia claims that the NSR lies within its
territorial waters, giving it exclusive rights to develop the area and
patrol ships. The U.S. and other countries dispute this claim, saying it
runs through international waters. Seeing the emerging opportunity,
Russia has been refurbishing more than 50 Soviet bases, providing them
with strategic ports and sending a political message that the NSR is
under Russian sovereignty.

[[Canada claims the Northwest Passage (NWP]{.underline}]{.mark}) is
located in internal Canadian waters and subject to Canadian law and
sovereignty. The U.S. and Europe disagree, arguing it also is an
international strait and subject to freedom of navigation under the Law
of the Sea. To date, there are very few ports along the NWP, with
Churchill being the only deep-water port with shelter and berthing
facilities. There are no deep-water ports along the North Slope of
Alaska or throughout the Canadian Archipelago. But this is changing. The
U.S. has plans to build its first deep-water Arctic port in Nome,
Alaska, and Canada is planning a deep-water port in Qikiqtarjuaq,
Nanuvut, which is located at the entrance to the NWP.

[[The Trans-Arctic Route, which cuts straight across the North Pole,
avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states and lies in international
high seas. Currently]{.underline}]{.mark}, and probably until
mid-century, [[it is only navigable by nuclear
icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}. But the possibilities are being
discussed today, foreseeing thousands of ships a year passing between
North America and Asia, with a hub at Alaska's Dutch Harbor. [[The ships
would not have size restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the Central
Arctic Ocean's depth is not as limiting as the NSR and NWP.

Further complicated by the effects of climate change is that [[the
Arctic is increasingly an environment in which weather conditions can
rapidly change. The United States needs]{.underline}]{.mark} to be
prepared with sufficient capabilities and [[**domain awareness** to
**mitigate the impact** of]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[adverse weather

[[Maintaining a persistent presence in support of]{.underline}]{.mark}
safety, security, and [[stewardship rather than global power projection
assets is achievable]{.underline}]{.mark}. It includes the construction
of PSCs and ASCs that can interdict IUU fishing and illegal smuggling,
perform SAR, and conduct vessel safety and security checks. Under Title
10, USCG vessels can also engage other military assets. It often does so
in cooperative ways, such as through exercises under the ACGF, Exercise
Argus, and Operation NANOOK. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} [[upgrading]{.underline}]{.mark}
existing airfields not only for military traffic but for civilian
traffic, bolstering [[links between isolated Arctic
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}. It involves
[[collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} with other members of the Arctic
Council, including Russia, to continue t[[o integrate regional **SAR
capabilities** to help **mitigate** the chance of **accidental**
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}. In sum, [[it involves **normalizing**
U.S. presence]{.underline}]{.mark}, activities, and exercises [[in the
Arctic region as a means of **deescalating
tensions**]{.underline}]{.mark} associated with that presence.

**[The attraction of a sea route through the Arctic has long captivated
sailors looking for faster transit between markets. However[, the
impassable ice covering the vast majority of Arctic waters has been an
inflexible barrier to shipping aspirations for centuries. Recent global
warming trends are giving rise to an increasingly accessible maritime
domain throughout the Arctic basin, creating enormous potential for the
area. Diminishing ice cover, abundant natural resources and changing
geopolitical trends are prompting stakeholders to reexamine the Arctic's
vast economic and strategic potential.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
Arctic's strategic environment is evolving as the region warms and
global stakeholders are attracted by the increasingly accessible natural
resources. **[Maritime activity will be driven by a combination of
economic and military trends. The Arctic's growing geopolitical
attention will likely bring increased military activity to protect the
national interests of key stakeholders. These interests include both
natural resources -- the huge reserves of oil and gas as well as
minerals -- and the opening up of maritime trade routes.]{.underline}**
While the number of ships in transit will remain low for the foreseeable
future due to the complexities of operating in the region, [**[there
will be an increase in commercial shipping activity in support of
resource extraction.]{.underline}** **[Most of this commercial shipping
activity will take place in Russian waters, as a result of the country's
robust approach to Arctic
development]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** Other maritime
traffic will also increase as the ice recedes. Recreational traffic --
cruise ships, sailing yachts and private motorboats -- will continue to
seek to take advantage of the newly accessible region to engage in 'last
chance' tourism. International fishing fleets are following migratory
species northwards, a phenomenon that is set to continue as global
warming pushes fish into colder waters. Although a moratorium on fishing
in the Central Arctic Ocean has been in place for more than a decade,
warming waters are likely to bring with them illicit activities.
**[While [it is essential to develop greater maritime domain awareness
in the region in order to monitor and prevent illicit
activities]{.mark},]{.underline}** the total amount of traffic will
remain a small fraction of overall activity**[. Trends in the Arctic --
particularly economic and geopolitical trends driven by regional warming
-- will bring greater maritime activity to the region.]{.underline}**
However, this activity will be more suited to local needs than universal
across the Arctic. **[Resource extraction will require transport to
markets, and specialised vessels will continue to provide this
transport.]{.underline}** But the northern waters will not become a
widely used global shipping route in the near future. **[[New
geopolitical tensions and subsequent militarisation could also hamper
commercial activity in the region. The costs of operating in the Arctic
are high; misperceptions and misunderstandings in the region have the
potential to trigger conflicts.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Recent
geostrategic developments have raised concerns about the militarisation
of the Arctic, a region long identified by the maxim 'High North, Low
Tension'. **[The viability of future maritime activity in the Arctic
faces significant challenges]{.underline}**, and the complexities of
operating in the region will dampen the enthusiasm of most stakeholders.
While maritime traffic remains limited to a small fraction of global
activity[, **[it is critical to better understand the challenges and
drivers of traffic in the region]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and their
impact on regional security and stability.]{.underline}** As economic
interests grow, so do military activities. Over the past decade, Canada,
Denmark, Norway, Russia and the US have prominently expanded their
military capabilities in the Arctic region. Military exercises continue
to be carried out in these harsh conditions, on a larger scale and with
greater frequency, namely Trident Juncture 2018, Cold Response 2022, and
Grom 2019 exercises. The development of capabilities, together with the
increase in weapons testing and military exercises, indicates a growing
margin for the risk of escalation or outright conflict. NATO's approach
to the region is not yet enshrined in a clear strategy for the Arctic,
and the new Strategic Concept focusing on defence and deterrence,
unveiled in June 2022 at the NATO Summit in Madrid, refers to potential
disruptions in the High North from "allied reinforcements and freedom of
navigation across the North Atlantic".

The appreciation of the multifaceted threat vectors arising from
localized environmental degradation and resource and food scarcity
presents one of the more compelling challenges for policymakers. In his
2012 book Climate Wars: What People Will be Killed in the 21st Century,
Harald Welzer argued that the consequences stemming from the
relationship between violence and climate change will "establish
different social conditions from those we have known until now" which
will "spell the end of the Enlightenment and its conception of freedom"
resulting in the decline of the Western social model based on democracy
and liberalism. Resource scarcity and relative economic deprivation will
lead to violence, and violence, Welzer contends, is always highly
adaptive and "innovative" as it develops "new forms and new conditions"
for the use of force. The twentieth-century wars may well have been
driven by conflicts over land, religion, and economic interests but
[[the wars of the 21st century will in no insignificant measure be
fueled by the multipronged environmental crises leading to a potential
state failure contagion, water and food shortages, and a brutal scramble
for resource dominance in strategic areas of the globe. The world's
rapacious appetite for natural resources and rare earth minerals will
open new theatres of potential conflict ranging from outer space to the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The Arctic's Military Landscape

[[Melting ice in the Arctic is unlocking a valuable natural resource
base, oil and gas deposits, and minerals necessary for fueling "green"
economic growth already pushing countries to jostle over territorial
claims and control of the region's shipping routes and navigation
rights. The world's insatiable hunger for the vast Arctic
deposits]{.underline}]{.mark} of oil, gas, nickel, copper, lead, zinc,
diamonds, gold, silver, manganese, titanium, and abundant fisheries
worth trillions of dollars present a substantial incentive for
cooperation and [[a]{.mark}n]{.underline} even

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to prevent Iran
from closing the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world\'s most important
shipping routes.

His comments came after [[Iran\'s]{.mark} state-run Press TV reported
that [parliament]{.mark} had [**approved** a plan to **close the
Strait** but]{.mark} added that [the final decision lies with the
Supreme National Security Council]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[**Any disruption** to the supply of oil would have **profound
consequences** for the **economy**]{.mark}. China in particular is the
world\'s largest buyer of Iranian oil and has a close relationship with
Tehran]{.underline}.

Oil prices rose following the US attack on Iranian nuclear sites, with
the price of the benchmark Brent crude reaching its highest level in
five months.

\"I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them \[Iran\]
about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for
their oil,\" Rubio had said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday.

\"[If they \[close the Straits\]]{.underline}\... it will be economic
suicide for them. And we retain options to deal with that, but other
countries should be looking at that as well. [It would hurt other
countries\' economies]{.underline} a lot worse than ours.\"

[Around [**20%** of the world\'s oil passes through the
**Strait**]{.mark} **of Hormuz**, with [major oil and gas producers in
the Middle East using the waterway to **transport energy** from the
region]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Any attempt to disrupt operations in the Strait]{.mark} could [send
**global oil prices skyrocketing**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Oil prices jumped briefly when trading began on Monday]{.underline},
with Brent climbing to \$81.40 a barrel. [However, it then **slid back**
to around \$76.30, **below** where it had started the day.]{.underline}

In a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday, US President Donald
Trump said: \"EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I\'M WATCHING! YOU\'RE
PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON\'T DO IT!\"

Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, said: \"The US
is now positioned with an overwhelming defence posture in the region to
be prepared for any Iran counter-attacks. But [[the risk for oil
prices]{.mark} is the situation [could **escalate severely
further**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

The cost of crude oil affects everything from how much it costs to fill
up your car to the price of food at the supermarket.

[**[China]{.mark}** in particular buys more oil from Iran than any other
nation - with its imports from Iran surpassing 1.8 million barrels per
day last month]{.underline}, according to data by ship tracking firm
Vortexa.

[Other major Asian economies, including [**India**, **Japan** and
**So**]{.mark}**uth [Ko]{.mark}rea**, also [rely heavily on crude oil
that passes through the Strait]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The **missile [attacks]{.mark}** [in the **Red Sea** provide a]{.mark}
stark [reminder of the vulnerability of]{.mark} commercial
[shipping]{.mark}]{.underline}. While prior threats, such as those from
pirates off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Guinea could be
warded off by armed guards riding shotgun, [the more sophisticated
threat from **Iran-backed Houthi** terrorists has called for the
deployment of **serious naval assets**]{.underline}. These developments
provide insights into how the logic of commercial interests is being
trumped by geopolitical tensions.

The supply lines and choke points

The opening of the Suez Canal was a historic event that transformed
global logistics. Ever since its completion in 1869, it has been the
favored route for shipping from Europe to Asia, allowing ships to avoid
the lengthy detour around the continent of Africa. The downside is that
these savings do not come without risks.

The broader lesson of the recent Red Sea events is that [[the **global**
flow of goods can be **held hostage** via **critical choke
points**]{.mark} that determined actors may interdict]{.underline}. The
Suez Crisis in 1956 provided an early illustration that threats to the
ownership of critical real estate can provoke war. When Egyptian
president Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal Company, which
had been controlled by French and British interests, France, Britain and
Israel responded with military intervention.

The canal zone itself is not the only vulnerability on this vital route.
To the south, the narrow Strait of Bab el-Mandeb separates Africa from
the Arabian Peninsula. That is where Somali pirates emerged as a key
player and where Houthi terrorists operating out of Yemen began
threatening shipping by laying sea mines.

[[A choke point of]{.mark} similar [importance is the **Strait of
Hormuz**]{.mark}, which offers [the **only** passage for tankers out of
the Persian Gulf]{.mark}. As tensions between Iran and the West have
escalated, [it has become a]{.mark} significant global [flash point. By
moving to **block** it, Iran]{.mark} (or its proxies) [could cause a
**global energy crisis** that could then translate into]{.mark} a
**kinetic [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Further to the east, China has long been aware of its own vulnerability,
as the United States Navy may interdict its energy supply from the
Persian Gulf at the Strait of Malacca. A total blockage could stop 80
percent of the Middle Kingdom's crude oil imports. As in the case of a
Strait of Hormuz blockage, it would inevitably produce a flashing red
alert.

[[Even short of such outcomes, the]{.mark} mounting [risks]{.mark} of
prolonged **disturbances** at various choke points [**hurt shipping** by
increasing **uncertainty and insurance costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Enter the northern route

[[The combined impact]{.mark} of all these developments has been to
[shed]{.mark} new [light on the **Northern Sea Route**]{.mark}
**(NSR)**, which links Europe with Asia via the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}.

While the distance from Rotterdam to Yokohama via the Suez Canal Route
is about 21,500 kilometers, it shrinks to only 11,900 kilometers via the
Northern Sea. [The **[time of passage]{.mark}** -- a **critical** factor
in determining the **efficiency** of shipping routes -- [is]{.mark} in
this case [**reduced** by close to **half**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Taking the Northern Sea Route was long practically **impossible** due
to the thick **sea ice** laced with impenetrable ridges. However, as
climate change has caused the Arctic ice cover to recede, [**new
opportunities** have surfaced]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If it were a purely commercial decision, a massive wager on this route
would have been a foregone conclusion. The commercial argument received
an added boost in March 2021, when a stranded container ship blocked the
Suez Canal for six days, holding up to 400 vessels in place and causing
massive economic losses. To Western countries, however, the northern
seaway is far from a purely commercial matter.

**Conflict in Iran over the Red Sea escalates. Gaza conflict set the
stage and changed regional calculus.**

State (In)action and Conflict Escalation The Houthi group has advocated
for the annihilation of Israel for years prior to the outbreak of the
Israel-Hamas conflict in October, but it took no action in response. In
contrast, Hezbollah has characterized Hamas' assault as "a decisive
response to Israel's continued occupation," thus regarding it not merely
as an initiation but rather as an extension of the conflict between
Israel and Hamas, and more specifically as a reaction to how Hezbollah
perceived Israel's indiscriminately violent campaign against the
Palestinian people. In addition to escalating their assaults on ships
traversing the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the Houthi have continued to
target Israel with cruise and ballistic missiles and drones. The
frequency of drone attacks perpetrated by Iran-backed militias against
U.S. bases in Syria and Iraq, where the United States maintains 900 and
2,500 personnel respectively, has increased substantially since October
7, 2023. As of the first week of January 2024, there have been 115 such
attacks. The al-Tanf garrison in Syria, the Bashur airbase in the
vicinity of Iraqi Kurdistan's Erbil city, and the al-Asad airbase in
al-Anbar have been among the targets. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq and
the Iraqi Shiite militia jointly issued an online statement wherein they
claimed responsibility for the attacks on American military
installations involving so-called kamikaze drones. **[[As the frequency
of these assaults escalated, the United States responded by augmenting
its military presence in the Middle East,]{.mark} dispatching an
additional 300 personnel and launching retaliatory airstrikes against
various militant groups,]{.underline}** including Kata'ib Hezbollah
(KH), or the Hezbollah Brigades, a radical Iraqi Shiite paramilitary
organization**[. [Given the increasing militarization and contestation
in the region, it is not implausible that the U.S. and coalition powers
will mount a more potent military response]{.mark} than the mere
deployment of naval task forces.]{.underline}** At present, there are
increasing demands on the Biden administration to target Houthi
strongholds, which **[[increases the likelihood of both horizontal and
vertical escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** President Biden has
displayed a hesitancy to respond to escalating pressure to launch
military operations against Houthi targets located within Yemen.
**[Critics of employing military force against Houthi strongholds in
Yemen might potentially contend that such an approach [would serve
Iran's interests by enticing the U.S. into a proxy conflict and by
heightening the likelihood of another expensive
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** between Saudi Arabia and Yemen, both of
which are presently navigating a precarious truce. On the contrary,
Washington's implied acceptance of persistent Houthi attacks sets a
precedent whereby they adopt a passive stance and essentially accept
militant groups' attacks without retaliation. The notion of conflict
escalation became increasingly prevalent throughout the Cold War,
particularly with regard to the potential for nuclear exchanges between
the two dominant global powers**[. Recent state and non-state
interactions, [the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the Israel-Hamas
conflict in particular, have caused the escalation of military conflicts
to deviate from the established parameters of explicit Rules of
Engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}** (ROE) and international humanitarian
law (IHL). These rules and regulations determine what actions are
considered appropriate, acceptable, or unacceptable. The unwillingness
of many countries---particularly Western governments---to uphold or
abide by international law as well as their inconsistent approaches to
resolving international disputes make the problem worse. **[Although
[the October 7th attack]{.mark} by Hamas has not yet precipitated a
regional conflict in the Middle East, it [has laid the groundwork for
the commencement of new phases and arenas of military exchange and
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** in adjacent environs. As noted,
diverting international shipping to other longer routes that are also
highly susceptible to maritime piracy elevates the opportunities for
militant groups operating well beyond the Middle East and its peripheral
areas, especially given the ever-increasing demand for and attraction of
oil as a vital energy commodity. Comparable to the Red Sea, Iran
perceives the Eastern Mediterranean as a **[[potential flashpoint
region, thereby augmenting the probability of armed confrontation in
that area. The increasing tensions and military engagements in the Red
Sea have the potential to attract more nations into the dispute]{.mark},
thereby [escalating]{.mark} an already limited [military exchange into a
more extensive and protracted conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This is
primarily due to the critical nature of the waterway, which affects all
states, albeit to varying degrees, but also because states' compliance
with the U.S. as a de facto security guarantor in the region cannot be
guaranteed. This has already been reflected in the refusal of various
governments to participate in the joint naval task force, and by their
decision in some cases to act externally to the combined operation.
Landlocked Ethiopia, a country of more than 120 million
inhabitants---the second-most populous country in Africa---officially
disbanded its naval headquarters in Adis Ababa in 1996, and its navy
ceased to exist. Its only military watercraft, a tiny patrol boat,
operates on Lake Tana. However, like other states in the region,
"Ethiopia's existence as a nation is linked to the Red Sea," which
depends on "balanced mutual sharing," as Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy
Ahmed expressed last October. **[The potential for nations to respond in
a unilateral, disproportionate, or otherwise unconventional manner,
which may incite violent responses from neighboring states and non-state
actors in the vicinity.]{.underline}** Whenever states act unilaterally
and in pursuit of their own national interests, there are inherently
perilous consequences, particularly when they conflict with the
interests of other nations or actors. As an extension of the ongoing
Israel-Hamas conflict, **[the developing Red Sea conflict has already
demonstrated its potential to act as a perilous precursor to additional
destabilizing actions by various geopolitical actors. Despite the
historical significance of de-escalation, economic considerations, [the
imperative to ensure secure navigation in the Red Sea, and the
self-interest of nations may serve as a legitimate justification and
pretext for extending military operations]{.mark} into additional
regions in the Middle East to counter other militant groups. Such a
course of action has the potential [to yield unanticipated and
exponential effects. It is plausible to suggest that states vying and
competing for control of global supply chains could spark modern power
struggles and conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While scholars have
posited that economic interdependence is crucial for preserving
structural peace and stability, as evidenced by the absence of major
interstate conflict in the Asia-Pacific comparable to the Second World
War, **[[disruptions in interdependence may also fuel great power
politics]{.mark} and provide opportunities for desperate competition
among states or for some states to ensnare vulnerable parties rendered
even more susceptible to supply chain deterioration or the
inaccessibility of commodities and critical economic
resources.]{.underline}** Such economic opportunism and coercion could
occur anywhere, as historical evidence demonstrates the existence of
instances of this type of power politics. **[This situation gives rise
to additional questions and concerns regarding the potential occurrence
of conflict, which may be precipitated by heightened economic
competition, further complicated by limited access to global supplies
and resources.]{.underline}**

[incoming admin]{.mark}istration.]{.underline} During the campaign,
Trump vowed, "You're going to have peace in the Middle East" once he

prove very difficult. Many in his circle favor giving Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin [Netanyahu]{.mark} a **free hand** to [**decimate**

Trump's long-stated wish to arrange a **diplomatic** rapprochement
between **Israel** and **Saudi Arabia**, which has vowed to abjure any
such outcome unless it allows for the establishment of a Palestinian
state. The pro-Israel ideologues are also certain to call for
**unrestrained attacks** on **Iran** should it undertake a new round of
**missile strikes** at Israel. ([Iran]{.mark}'s **senior leaders** have
[**pledged retaliation** for Israel's]{.mark} October 26 air

monarchies---endeavors that would likely be stymied by another Middle
Eastern war. Which of these contending views ultimately prevails will,
to a large degree, determine whether Trump succeeds in bringing peace to
the region or presides over ever-increasing levels of violence.

Despite all the focus on strategic competition in Europe and Asia, one
region of the world has at long last begun receiving the attention it
warrants from the U.S. military: the Arctic. [[The Arctic is of unique
importance]{.underline}]{.mark} to all Americans. First, [[the United
States is one of just eight sovereign Arctic states]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- joined by Canada, Denmark (thanks to its autonomous territory
Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden --- which
allows for the exercise of certain sovereign rights in the region and
bestows member status in the international Arctic Council.1 China is, of
course, notably absent, despite its self-proclaimed (and at best
dubious) status as a "near-Arctic" state2 and its observer status on the
Arctic Council. Second, the effects of [[global climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[increasing access]{.underline}]{.mark}
to previously inaccessible Arctic areas and important [[transit and
trade]{.underline}]{.mark} routes. This increased access [[results
in]{.underline}]{.mark} yet [[another theatre]{.underline}]{.mark} for
strategic competition, and thus, [[it is curious that the Arctic was not
mentioned in the Biden administration's Interim National Security
Guidance]{.underline}]{.mark}3 --- although it has engaged on Arctic
issues around this month's Arctic Council summit.4

3.5 Leveraging Partnerships for Integrated Deterrence

[[Based on interviews with experts and officials from the Arctic 7
countries, there is consensus on a number of scenarios Arctic allies
should strive to deter]{.underline}]{.mark}. These include the use of
strategic and tactical nuclear weapons; conventional and
non-conventional military force operations impeding the Arctic 7's
regional access and freedom of operation and navigation; and
sub-threshold activities, especially attacks on undersea cables and
critical national or shared infrastructure. In addition, the Arctic 7
should use the current moment to assess military cooperation between
Russia and China in circumpolar affairs and consider how to deter both
Russian and Chinese activities in the region.

[[Key steps to strengthen collective defense and
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic [[will be to enhance
presence, resilience, readiness, as well as C2]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Beyond this, it will be critical to coordinate and facilitate clarity of
mission based on a unified understanding of the threat and operating
landscape. Lastly, the Arctic 7 should focus on strategic communication.
As one expert put it, [[messaging should be "bold and coordinated",
ensuring that "all NATO voices are carefully
tuned."]{.underline}]{.mark}

To achieve this, [[it will be important to gain a better understanding
of Arctic conflict and response scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}. Tabletop
exercises that allow political and military leaders from Arctic 7
countries to develop national, allied, and broader multilateral
responses, would be a useful tool in this effort. In addition, it will
be crucial to put in place clear formats for quick decision making.
[[Any discussions around forward defense or persistent presence in the
Arctic should be carefully deliberated with allies and
partners]{.underline}]{.mark}. Experts stress that any such [[action
should be precise and clearly and transparently
communicated]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The U.S. Space Force ([[USSF]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[develop advanced
capabilities and expand]{.underline}]{.mark} its understanding to
support [[polar operations]{.underline}]{.mark}. As such, the USSF
should advance its efforts to organize, train, and equip the forces and
resources necessary [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} maintain and
[[advance]{.underline}]{.mark} complete Arctic [[domain
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}. The service should also look for ways to
build relationships with civilian agencies charged with similar
missions, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} relevant members of the
Intelligence Community (IC) and other spacefaring agencies like the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. In doing so, the
USSF should champion both quantitative and qualitative improvements to
resilient [[space based Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance ([[ISR]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[coverage]{.underline}]{.mark} for the entire U.S. government.
Likewise, U.S. Space Command should consider what unique challenges, if
any, Arctic operations pose to its responsibilities [[to support

assets operating in increasingly congested, contested, and competitive39
earth orbits and whether the similarly increasingly competitive high
latitudes present additional risk to those assets, and particularly

(ermo-MSDI, acc 7-2-2025)

Coast Guard

As the "era of Coast Guards"50 takes hold and the age of strategic
competition with state-based rivals shows no sign of slowing anytime
soon, [[we must]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[question whether
traditional conceptions of "defense" truly meet U.S. national strategic
priorities]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in the phase of national
interaction [[short of armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[This makes it critical that]{.underline}]{.mark} the Coast Guard
continue to serve in its post-9/11 role as an integrator between the
[[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}, the IC,51 and DHS, especially as more DHS
components [[establish larger Arctic footprints]{.underline}]{.mark} and
undertake additional Arctic operations. The DHS strategy specifically
acknowledges this role for the Coast Guard in that there is little
direction in the strategy that does not include at least nominal Coast
Guard leadership or participation.

But most importantly, the Coast Guard must closely partner with the
administration and Congress to continue the [[advancement
of]{.underline}]{.mark} its new [[icebreaker]{.underline}]{.mark}
construction program, the Polar Security Cutter
([[PSC]{.underline}]{.mark}), and any follow up icebreaker
recapitalization program.52 As a start, this means an overt, clear, and
consistent message from the Coast Guard and unmistakable support from
the Biden administration regarding the number of necessary ships and
their envisioned capabilities, along with the the necessary logistics
and infrastructure tail to effectively operate them.

The Coast Guard currently has two aged operational icebreakers, one
heavy and one medium, and has received funding for the procurement of
the first of at least three planned new polar icebreakers.53 By way of
comparison, the Navy just laid the keel for the 74th Arleigh Burke-class
destroyer.54 Seventyfour. Destroyers are not icebreakers and it is not
an entirely fair direct comparison, but the difference in scale between
naval shipbuilding and Coast Guard shipbuilding is stark.

This difference is made more stark in the Arctic because while it is the
Coast Guard's conscious object to trade hard-power punch for
multimission flexibility, Coast Guard forces are, at all times, military
forces, and thus with proper design forethought in preserving sufficient
space, weight, and power can "up arm" as appropriate, to facilitate more
defense-oriented missions. This is not to say that the Coast Guard
should mirror the hard-hitting kinetic capabilities of the Navy. Doing
so would be folly and change the fundamental character of the service.
But it does mean that with the right kit, Coast Guard
[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, starting with the PSC, should be
able to [[serve]{.underline}]{.mark}, when necessary, [[as secure
communications relay platforms and satellite uplink/download
stations]{.underline}]{.mark}; mobile staging sites; resupply vessels;
"lily pads" for manned and particularly unmanned aviation, surface, and
subsurface vessels; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} if history provides any
guide, perhaps [[even anti-submarine]{.underline}]{.mark}55
[[detection]{.underline}]{.mark} force multipliers. [[This last
role]{.underline}]{.mark}, while a bit novel in this context, [[may
prove the most important given]{.underline}]{.mark} recent reporting on
[[the Russian military's interest in undersea
communications]{.underline}]{.mark} and cable junctions, some of which
flow through the Arctic, [[that carry]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly [[100%
of communications]{.underline}]{.mark} traffic
[[between]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the United States and
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}.56

[[MDA requires gathering, synthesizing, and sharing information from a

**environment**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., weather, hydrographic and
bathymetric data, sea temperature, ice flows) (National Maritime
Intelligence-Integration Office, 2022, A1-A2). [[It relies on toolssuch
as satellite imagery, AI, surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} aircraft,
radar,[[sensor technology]{.underline}]{.mark}, and web-centric
enterprise services (e.g., clouds, databases). For example, the US Naval
Research Laboratory launched "Proteus" in 2022 [[to address security
threats]{.underline}]{.mark} such as illegal, unreported, and
unregulated fishing. This program identifies, queries, and filters
maritime vessels based on user-defined criteria and the Defense
Innovation Unit's international competition (xView3) to create machine
learning models to locate and distinguish maritime vessels with
synthetic aperture radar (Indo Pacific Defense Forum, 2022). Canadian
Marine Security Operation Centers (MSOCs) are an example of an
organizational MDA tool. The MSOCs comprise federal government
departments and agencies that work together to share intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance information and data.

We recommend [[NORTHCOM as the primary]{.underline}]{.mark} geographic
combatant [[commander for the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. NORTHCOM [[is
the best choice because of]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[inherent
responsibilities]{.underline}]{.mark} for the defense of the homeland
and its shared responsibilities with Canada through the North American
Aerospace Defense Command for defending the northern Arctic approaches
to the North American continent.34 [[NORTHCOM could]{.underline}]{.mark}
then use its convening authority to [[bring together
stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark} (INDOPACOM, EUCOM, etc.) [[to
synchronize]{.underline}]{.mark} efforts behind unified [[DOD
guidance]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are likely authorities that each
combatant command has that might be brought to bear to solve each
other's problems. But finding solutions starts with placing a specific
combatant commander "in charge" who can ask the hard questions and begin
working possible solutions.

Some may argue that including the Arctic region under NORTHCOM may
reduce visibility on other influential actors affecting the region such
as Chinese hybrid military and paramilitary activities intended for the
Arctic, but this issue can easily mitigated through close coordination
between INDOPACOM and NORTHCOM. Additionally, [[designating
NORTHCOM]{.underline}]{.mark} as the nation's Arctic defense champion
would not only facilitate closer integration amongst the DOD services
but also [[has the advantage of capitalizing on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
preexisting [[close relationships]{.underline}]{.mark} between that
combatant command [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} DHS, in addition to

[[A general policy approach should be]{.underline}]{.mark} Januslike:
[[balancing cooperation and competition]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Diplomatically, with like-minded partners, the United States should
continue to underscore the importance of a rules-based order and
building a shared awareness of the region, its challenges, and
opportunities. But there is more to be done. For one, [[investment in
risk reduction, mitigation]{.underline}]{.mark} efforts, [[and defense
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} via mechanisms like the Arctic Security
Forces Roundtable reduces tensions and [[increases
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region. Additionally, [[the DOD

In the context of the United States' 2022 "National Strategy for the
Arctic Region" and the Department of Defense's "2024 Arctic Strategy,"
[[the US]{.underline}]{.mark} government [[should]{.underline}]{.mark}
continue to [[expand its]{.underline}]{.mark} global perspective
regarding presence and access to the [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

• US stakeholders should identify key priorities for capabilities and
procurement of Arctic-enabled systems, specifically [[domain
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities and ice-capable ships with
anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities, as well as streamline
coordination efforts internally as well as with NATO allies.

• US NORTHCOM must become the "Arctic capability advocate" envisioned by
the 2024 DoD Arctic strategy. [[This will require increased coordination
with EUCOM]{.underline}]{.mark} (North Atlantic Area of Responsibility)
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[INDOPACOM]{.underline}]{.mark} (military
assets and troops in Alaska), especially regarding deployments,
readiness, and exercises.

• [[NATO must]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[determine
its]{.underline}]{.mark} role and place in circumpolar security and
internally build its Arctic dimension and [[framework
of]{.underline}]{.mark} operations --- without necessarily creating a
full-fledged strategy or an "Arctic command." In other words, the
Atlantic alliance should answer the questions "how much NATO" is needed
and necessary in the Arctic as well as "what kind of NATO" is relevant
to the region.

• NATO needs an [[operational roadmap for the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. This can be achieved [[by
building]{.underline}]{.mark} internal [[awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}
and knowledge of Arctic affairs as well as taking stock of already
existing endeavors and streamlining them under one umbrella. This will
require more information [[and intelligence
sharing]{.underline}]{.mark}, and ultimately better coordination, such
as with the help of a dedicated Arctic working group.

• The Nordic allies should seek opportunities to lead in the alliance on
regional security challenges. As cooperation and collaboration continue
to grow, [[particularly among Norway, Sweden, and
Finland]{.underline}]{.mark}, these nations can provide needed insights
and recommendations to the alliance on how to approach the High North
security challenges and lead on a comprehensive NATO strategy.

• NATO also needs to determine the contour of command and control
organization for Arctic operations, likely under JFC Norfolk. Critical
to this debate will be the interconnection with JFC Brunssum, NORAD, and
US command structures within NATO in an Arctic context.

the Air Force [[plays a lead role]{.underline}]{.mark} in homeland
defense through its missions [[via the North Warning System which helps

[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Air [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Space
forces provide [[land and space-based awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} in

refueling aircraft. This makes the Arctic a key area to project
combat-credible power into Eurasia. The department also runs an Arctic
Weather Survival school and operates the only ski-equipped aircraft,

Air Force

In the air domain, little has changed [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Air Force should focus on what it does
best: contribute to awareness and defense of the homeland via defense of
air and missile threats. However, it will not always be the case that a
good defense will be enough. With the other services, [[the Air Force
should]{.underline}]{.mark} look into operational concepts that provide
options to military commanders across the four "C"s: contingency,
competition, crisis, and conflict.

The Air Force could aggregate and [["scale-up"]{.underline}]{.mark} new
[[operating concepts]{.underline}]{.mark} that deal with long distances
and survivability [[already]{.underline}]{.mark} being [[used in the
Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, [[F-35s]{.underline}]{.mark}
practice [[island-hopping]{.underline}]{.mark}40 and F-22s use the
"Rapid Raptor" concept to deploy four aircraft to an austere
environment.41 Another operational issue is how to keep the fighters
refueled. Innovative Airmen recently tested the first ever [["engine

Stratotanker that [[reduced time on the ground from]{.underline}]{.mark}
four-to-[[six hours to one]{.underline}]{.mark} hour.42 What is in
common among these three types of aircraft? They are all based in
Alaska. It is worth taking a hard look at how these concepts may or may
not be useful in the competition in the Arctic.

Flux towers. [[Measurements from EC flux towers span the gap between in
situ]{.underline}]{.mark} terrain-scale research [[and airborne
sensing]{.underline}]{.mark} at the landscape level. Across the Arctic,
over 212 active flux towers124 have revealed carbon flux patterns and
storage, and physical or seasonal controls on emission125. [[Flux towers
can]{.underline}]{.mark} incorporate vertical surface and
near-atmosphere-level fluxes to [[quantify photosynthesis,
evapotranspiration, soil moisture and
respiration]{.underline}]{.mark}125,126. Placement versatility has
further highlighted carbon fluxes from lake and thermokarst
environments. For example, when placed in lakes, flux towers expose
winter ebullition and summer uptake patterns, incorporating atmospheric
pressure and temperature dynamics127. Flux towers are often able to span
the gap between in situ and atmospheric measurements, providing critical
information about fluxes in the near-surface atmosphere.

[[When incorporated]{.underline}]{.mark} into systems models, [[flux
tower data are instrumental in constraining model
outputs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Utilizing flux tower data in carbon models
resulted in a 13.4% decrease in mean carbon residence for tundra
ecosystems in Alaska, indicating that carbon cycling in the boreal
ecosystem could be increasing65. The granular, scalable data provided by
flux towers identify ecosystem controls that are difficult to model and
measure.

Advances in instrument and analysis techniques have enabled the
application of airborne EC flux measurements to evaluate regional-scale
carbon release in the Arctic128,129. Airborne EC fluxes provide a
powerful tool with which to test methods for upscaling flux tower
measurements to regional scales130--132, as well as regionalscale
inversions of atmospheric concentration data from tall towers and/or
aircraft12,133--136. [[Pan-Arctic CO2 and CH4 flux measurements could
soon be possible by integrating]{.underline}]{.mark} current and future
[[space-based flux towers]{.underline}]{.mark} by matching plot-scale
measurements under known conditions125.

Systematically monitor carbon mobilization. [[A comprehensive synthesis
of Arctic carbon fluxes concluded that the Arctic has been a
sink]{.underline}]{.mark} for carbon [[for decades, but the strength of
this sink is uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}156. Contemporary estimates
suggest a sink of 110TgC per year CO2 (range 80--291TgC per year) and
emission of 19TgC per year CH4 (range 8--29 TgC per year)156. The high
level of uncertainty highlights that [[the current atmospheric CO2 and
CH4 measurement system is inadequate to quantify the Arctic carbon
budget, identify the source(s) of changes]{.underline}]{.mark} in
long-term atmospheric trends [[and detect]{.underline}]{.mark} the onset
of [[large-scale]{.underline}]{.mark} old carbon [[mobilization from

methods160,161 could soon offer continuous in situ detection of

[[Operating without sufficient communications tools is "arguably more
dangerous in the Arctic than in many other places, given the vast
distances, risky operating conditions, small population and very limited
infrastructure,"]{.underline}]{.mark} according to a 2018 Homeland
Security Operational Analysis Center report titled, "Identifying
Potential Gaps in U.S. Coast Guard Arctic Capabilities." The center is
operated by the RAND Corp. under a contract with the Department of
Homeland Security.

[[Operators in the Arctic currently rely on voice communications via
existing radios and some satellite capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark},
including the Iridium Communications constellation, which operates in
low-Earth orbit and provides global voice and data satellite coverage.
The Navy's mobile user objective system communications satellites can
also assist with coverage in the Arctic, but they are not yet available
to the Coast Guard, according to the report. [[Cell phone communications
are extremely limited, and data transmission is even more
challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Communications capabilities in the Arctic were described as "woefully
inadequate" by sources cited in the report, which offered several
possible avenues for remediation, including installing additional
infrastructure and leveraging the growing number of commercial
communications satellites in polar orbits.

Communications and weather are major capability gaps for Arctic
operators, said Charity Weeden, president of Lquinox Consulting, a
Silver Spring, Maryland-based space and data management consulting firm.

Weeden previously served as a navigator for the Royal Canadian Air Force
and performed Arctic patrols and open ocean surveillance in a CP-140
anti-submarine and maritime surveillance aircraft, the Canadian variant
of a P-3 Orion. She also worked on U.S.-Canada military space
cooperation.

Before satellite phones were installed on patrol aircraft, getting a
signal to connect with command and control was a perennial struggle in
her navigator role, she noted.

"Whenever we performed Arctic patrols, we had to give an update of our
position to make sure we call back and say, ... 'We're all good, we're
on task,'" she said. The ionosphere frequently affects high-frequency
radio waves and disrupts communications, she added.

"When I would go out to send my position report, I would just get
static. And so I would spend the bulk of that time ... trying to hail
the operations center to tell them where we are and that we're safe,"
Weeden said. "The day I flew and the satellite phone was installed ... I
conducted my call and they heard me loud and clear. And that was a
relief."

[[Communications in the Arctic could still be
improved]{.underline}]{.mark}, she noted. [[More wideband
coverage]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular [[could help unmanned
systems or support search-and-rescue missions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The Coast Guard currently uses **some** satellites, sensors and
various fixed assets for domain awareness, navigation and weather
information, the operational analysis center report
noted]{.underline}]{.mark}. They include: the International
Cospas-Sarsat system, a satellite to facilitate search-and-rescue
missions; personal locator beacons; various sources of satellite imagery
and products; automatic identification systems on ships; land-based
receiving stations operated by the Marine Exchange of Alaska; and the
long-range identification and tracking system and sensors on Coast Guard
cutters and aircraft.

[[Combating hybrid threats in the European Arctic requires enhanced
undersea situational awareness, which the new generation of quantum
sensors will provide]{.underline}]{.mark}. As global connectivity grows,
[[both new and existing cables face increasingly complex
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}. Unlike traditional sensing
technologies, [[quantum sensors utilize the principles of quantum
physics, enabling rapid and precise **environment
monitoring**]{.underline}]{.mark}. With quantum entanglement and
superpositions, [[the sensors reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and
increase surveillance scope]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[These capabilities
are **crucial** amid the fear of **Russia** potentially deploying
sophisticated unmanned underwater vehicles to disrupt and tap critical
cables]{.underline}]{.mark}. Quantum sensors will not only serve as an
advanced early-warning mechanism but also make such intrusions nearly
impossible.

[[Quantum sensors will also act as a powerful deterrent. With their
advanced early detection and superior security capabilities, they will
discourage potential intruders from attempting to disrupt cables, as the
risks associated with conducting such activities will be significantly
higher. Enhanced situational awareness of the undersea theater will
force antagonistic actors to carefully consider their actions as their
chances of remaining undetected or unaccountable will be
diminished]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ultimately, the shift in the security
environment that will be brought about by quantum sensing capabilities
will foster robust defense mechanisms and establish new standards of
maritime conduct.

[[The transformative potential of quantum technology extends beyond
undersea applications, enhancing communication security, intelligence
gathering, and safeguarding critical infrastructure. Early adopters of
quantum sensing will not only gain a competitive advantage but also set
and shape the norms for its use]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is critical
that the NATO Arctic states and their allies collectively develop this
new generation of technology, strengthening telecommunication security
and establishing themselves as global leaders in its responsible
deployment.

[[Quantum technology is an emerging field in which being a first mover
in its development will be critical to US-China
competition]{.underline}]{.mark}. To prevent competitors and adversaries
from gaining this expertise first for their hybrid operations,
co-developing this advanced technology within the NATO architecture is
essential to reducing costs and accelerating development. Just as the
United States collaborated with its allies and partners to rapidly
develop nuclear weapons, it is time to adopt the same approach with
quantum technology.

[[Remote sensing]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Satellite
observations]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[expand]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[[the variety and quality of global data]{.underline}]{.mark} available
to researchers, [[providing an unprecedented view]{.underline}]{.mark}
of carbon cycle dynamics and [[PCF processes]{.underline}]{.mark}.
High-resolution remote sensing tools retrieve data on greenhouse gases
with high spatial resolution and low noise interference, determining CO2
and CH4 hotspots137. Current on-orbit satellite spectrometers that
gather CO2 or CH4 measurements at high latitudes provide diverse data
(Table 1). Satellites show high potential for categorizing soil
carbon10,138, upscaling emissions24 and identifying land surface
heterogeneity at high latitudes19. Soil wetting and carbon content have
been quantified with multispectral19,139 and synthetic aperture radar
observations140. An increase of data on heterogeneous Arctic landscapes
is already improving methane hotspot detection at specific sites,
allowing further exploration of localized emission across wetlands,
thermokarst and tundra100. The [[high-resolution observations from
satellite]{.underline}]{.mark} hyperspectral [[instruments could be
vital]{.underline}]{.mark} to determining hydrologic heterogeneity and
land cover change19,24. [[However, remote sensing
for]{.underline}]{.mark} jointly mapping carbon hotspots and
[[permafrost thaw is still in its infancy]{.underline}]{.mark}99.

At an international level, [[the combined efforts of numerous satellites
are ideal for integrating all existing data]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
missions from ESA, NASA and others work to standardize data for rapid
sharing and transposition. [[Future satellite missions are expected to
improve seasonal]{.underline}]{.mark} and diurnal
[[observations]{.underline}]{.mark} (Table 1). For example, MERLIN
(launch \~2025) will measure atmospheric methane independent of
sunlight, seasonality or some cloud cover. Satellite CO2M (launch 2025)
will measure CO2 and CH4 total columns to increase carbon flux
monitoring at small pixel sizes (2 × 2 km) and a relatively wide field
of view (250 km). Smaller pixel sizes will improve cloud-free
observations, [[enabling scale-matching between satellite data, aircraft
remote sensing, flux towers and in situ sampling]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Airborne remote sensing of Arctic methane hotspots using hyperspectral
imagery with metre-scale pixels indicates that upcoming space-based
hyperspectral imagers (such as EnMAP, PRISMA-SG, SBG and CHIME) will
make major contributions to the understanding of Arctic carbon
emissions100. The potential of these imagers is foreshadowed by the use
of Sentinel-2 data (20-m resolution) to detect methane point sources141.

While remote sensing is practical on a global scale,
[[higher-spatial-resolution data]{.underline}]{.mark} (below 20m) [[is
required to consistently determine precise carbon
release]{.underline}]{.mark} locations. Satellite carbon flux estimates
are limited in summer by low reflectivity from ice, snow and water, and
are severely degraded during the Arctic night (October--April).
Furthermore, thermal infrared satellite sensitivity is largest in the
upper troposphere between 200 and 750 hPa, making it challenging to
identify specific release locations at the surface. [[Comparing
satellite data to in situ carbon flux]{.underline}]{.mark} and land
change [[measurements requires high-efficacy downscaling tools that are
still under development]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, interpolating
data from flux towers with footprints typically ranging from 0.01 to
1.0km2 for regional or pan-Arctic carbon fluxes requires accurate
upscaling capabilities142. The [[diverse scales]{.underline}]{.mark},
modelling parameterizations and locational data [[mean that upscaling
does not match downscaling]{.underline}]{.mark}143. The
[[discontinuity]{.underline}]{.mark} between flux data across available
instruments [[makes estimating and predicting Arctic carbon release
difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}144,145.

**Satellites -- they fill gaps, are precise, and resilient.**

Bolster Arctic situational awareness through resilient space
capabilities.

[[Space capabilities are poised to fill important gaps in Arctic C4ISR
architecture. Additions in SATCOM could provide meaningful improvements
to meager existing communications infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}.
While not necessarily providing a 1:1 replacement for undersea
fiber-optic cables, [[investments in SATCOM would add layers of
redundancy and reduce the vulnerabilities associated with reliance on
undersea cables]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, space-based ISR would
bolster situational awareness and amplify Arctic states' abilities to
secure undersea networks, as well as reduce the risk of hostilities
being unattributable.

While the advantages of Starlink in Ukraine make the proposition of
directly utilizing Starlink in the Arctic for security purposes appear
intuitive, there are significant uncertainties that make the proposition
less attractive, including a risk of insecure encryption and
uncertainties regarding the interests of Elon Musk. Accordingly,
emulating the advantages of Starlink---predominantly through high
numbers of satellites in low Earth orbit---in developing new satellite
systems is preferable to relying on Starlink directly.

The European Union's proposed Infrastructure for Resilience,
Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite (IRIS2) constellation is the
closest realistic alternative to Starlink, but the project is limited in
scope and unlikely to become a serious competitor.57 This reflects the
historic difficulties of security collaboration in a European framework,
which are understandable considering European political fragmentation.
Nonetheless, in light of European security interests currently
threatened by Russia, the potential straining of transatlantic relations
due to an inward-focused United States, and the possibility of a SpaceX
technological monopoly in space, there are broad incentives for
consolidating European security interests.

Ukraine's successful use of space capabilities is not solely
attributable to Starlink but rather has included an array of smaller
satellites in low Earth orbit. [[Technological developments have enabled
broader uses for smaller satellites which, in tandem with lowering
launch costs, can bolster Arctic C4ISR
architecture]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[A broader space-based sensor
network enables various capabilities, including precision-strike weapons

Strengthen Deterrence

The [[Arctic 7 and interested NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as
the United Kingdom, [[must remain focused on]{.underline}]{.mark}
current and future [[Russian encroachments and constant probing of
NATO's air, land, and maritime sovereignty across the circumpolar
Arctic. Efforts should focus on denying Russia the use of its asymmetric
enablers, including A2AD systems and electronic
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} (EW) capabilities, and address any
ambitions toward out of area denial.

[[To strengthen allied capabilities and posture, domain awareness is
critical. This includes both Maritime Domain
Awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}, integrated air and space defense, and
[[better communications]{.underline}]{.mark} and ground-based [[space
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. The United States and NATO should also
give specific attention to countering [[and detecting unmanned
underwater vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly in the North
Atlantic. In addition, efforts to strengthen NATO's Integrated Air and
Missile Defense (IAMD) and the formal integration of highly capable and
interoperable Nordic Air Forces into IAMD will significantly enhance
NATO's and the Arctic 7's air defenses. Beyond capabilities,
[[communication and information sharing with allies and partners will
need to be optimized]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The United States, NATO, and bilateral partners should do more to
coordinate military exercises and joint drills [[to avoid duplication of
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as create an enhanced and
persistent presence [[which will ensure a more credible NATO
posture]{.underline}]{.mark}. Concurrently, NATO should launch a
coordinated strategic communications plan regarding activities in the
Arctic. This is true both for communication with allies and partners and
the broader global community, as well as [[signaling toward Russia and
China]{.underline}]{.mark}. With regard to Russia, [[**clarity** of
messaging and communication]{.underline}]{.mark} via existing working
channels [[will remain important]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The United States and its Arctic partners should reinforce political
cohesion and resilience in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and
proactively strengthen unity of purpose and societal resolve. [[It can
learn from Nordic comprehensive defense concepts]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Factors to consider are creating strong relationships and mutually
beneficial results when engaging local and indigenous communities and
aligning defense investments with climate goals.

[[By providing reliable and secure communication, the two-satellite ASBM
constellation]{.underline}]{.mark} --- hosted on Northrop Grumman's
GEOStar-3 satellite bus --- [[will deliver broad benefits to the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Jeremy Novosad, program
director, ASBM, Northrop Grumman. Two of ASBM's Northrop Grumman-built
payloads for the Norwegian Armed Forces and Viasat expand connectivity
[[for everything from air travel to shipping]{.underline}]{.mark} and
fishing to Allied operations, including search and rescue missions.

"[[Connectivity is the backbone of this unique
mission]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Jeremy. "It's a very critical
capability that we are delivering."

Alongside Space Norway's commercial payloads is the U.S. Space Force's
Enhanced Polar Systems-Recapitalization (EPS-R) payload. Also built by
Northrop Grumman, EPS-R will deliver protected, anti-jam military
satellite communications coverage to U.S. forces operating in the
Northern polar region and will be enabled by the Control and Planning
Segment (CAPS), Northrop Grumman's next-generation ground system.

"The U.S. military has to have a presence in the Arctic region. While
they're up there, they have to make sure there's good communications
back to the domestic command-and-control authority," said Steve Dunlop,
program manager, EPS-R CAPS Ground System, Northrop Grumman. "EPS-R
delivers faster, secure communications for U.S. forces, giving more
capabilities for the warfighter. That's the advantage."

The inclusion of EPS-R in ASBM represents a historic moment for hybrid
space missions: the first time an operational U.S. military payload is
hosted on an internationally operated, commercial satellite.

The EPS-R payload was isolated from the rest of the satellite, enabling
the payload to catch a ride on ASBM while meeting security requirements,
said Rohit Raja, who served as program director, EPS-R, Northrop
Grumman. The result is a trailblazing achievement that paves the way for
future hybrid military-commercial launches.

An Eye to the Future

In coming years, the [[broadband connectivity delivered by ASBM will
provide additional capabilities to commercial]{.underline}]{.mark} and
military [[crafts to navigate the High North]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
similar to how a cell tower provides connectivity to nearby devices,
said Inger Melby, capture director, Northrop Grumman. Inger grew up in
Norway and now works on Northrop Grumman's multi-intelligence MQ-4C
Triton.

"Triton was designed to use wide-band satellites and is immediately
capable of utilizing Norway's investment in ASBM," said Inger. "ASBM
will provide the satellite coverage that could further support a Triton
operating in the High North."

The most advanced maritime intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance
and targeting capability deployed today, [[Triton does not currently
operate in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} but is under consideration
for exactly that mission. The adoption of Triton in the region would
bring unprecedented Northern polar maritime surveillance, according to
Inger, delivering 24-hour coverage for the communications and command
and control needed to keep a constant eye on the Arctic maritime domain.

Bringing the region online with ASBM is the first step in writing the
Arctic's next chapter. Underpinned by assured connectivity, the
possibilities in the region are bright.

Maintaining a persistent C4ISR infrastructure in nonpermissive
conditions necessitates the integration of several essential enablers.
[[Drones have amassed attention throughout the fighting in Ukraine,
allowing asymmetric strike capabilities and serving as enablers of ISR
and target detection]{.underline}]{.mark}.48 Accordingly, [[drones have
played important roles in providing situational awareness in difficult
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}. To be sure, there are constraints in
drone-centric warfare. The "cheap mass" afforded by unmanned systems
provides resiliency and flexibility, and most drones are cheaper than
their countermeasures. However, as naval analyst Joshua Tallis argues,
limitations in speed, power, and size make drones complementary to,
rather than a replacement for, missiles---particularly in naval warfare,
as would be relevant in the largely maritime Arctic context.49

[[Drone warfare also has implications for the development of integrated
air and missile defense systems]{.underline}]{.mark} (IAMDs). The war in
Ukraine has demonstrated the advancement of IAMDs, such as the National
Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), Patriot Missiles, and
the S-300, with neither side having gained air superiority.50 However,
[[as reflected by the 2023 Chinese balloon incident, advanced sensors
quickly become ineffective when faced with something for which they are
not designed to look.]{.underline}]{.mark}51 In Ukraine, developing
IAMDs that can cost-efficiently counter drones has been challenging.52
As drones will remain an essential part of contemporary warfare, this
challenge will extend to Arctic states seeking to both integrate drones
into their military structures and to prepare countermeasures.

**Drones -- they provide reliable, cost-effective means for monitoring
the condition of shipping lanes.**

[[As the Arctic continues to be fundamentally reshaped, the United
States and its allies in the region will need to quickly adapt by
strengthening their collective]{.underline}]{.mark} security and
expanding their [[Arctic awareness. Arctic-ready unmanned aircraft
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} (UAS) [[can help them adjust to the
changing landscape.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The transformation of the Arctic---one of the world's harshest
environments---is being fueled by two significant factors: climate
change and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. First, [[climate
change is heating the Arctic, causing ice to rapidly
recede]{.underline}]{.mark}: Some estimates say that the Arctic could be
ice-free (during the summer) as soon as 2035. [[That is making natural
resources and shipping lanes more accessible. The Arctic holds nearly 30
percent of the world's undiscovered natural gas]{.underline}]{.mark}; it
also hosts growing fisheries that commercial (as well as illegal)
operations will aim to exploit. Additionally, [[the Arctic region has
the potential to connect roughly 75 percent of the world's population,
making quicker Arctic routes extremely valuable for commercial and
illicit traffic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Second, Russia's invasion of Ukraine (taking place over 1,700 kilometers
from the Arctic Circle) has largely ended cooperation between Moscow and
the countries known as the Arctic 7---Canada, Iceland, Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, Finland, and the United States---as Russia further militarizes
and disputes Arctic territory and resource ownership.

Together, these two factors are contributing to increases in commercial
traffic, illegal shipping and fishing operations, competition over
natural resources, and militarization.

Russia controls 53 percent of the Arctic Ocean coastline and has made
massive investments in building and modernizing its Arctic bases,
fleets, and weapons systems over the past two decades. During this time,
Russia has been building up a fleet of nuclear-capable icebreakers,
ships, and submarines; established more mining and drilling operations;
and made moves that suggest it aims to control Arctic Sea routes
normally accessible to all. Russia has also militarized its fishing
vessels, icebreakers, and other commercial vessels and has taken
increasingly aggressive actions in the Arctic as it disputes
jurisdiction over territorial waters and seabeds.

When it comes to investing in Arctic security, the Arctic 7
countries---all of which are NATO allies except for pending member
Sweden---are largely playing catch-up in their efforts to counter
Russia's investments. However, over the past year, US and NATO leaders
have woken up to the evolving environment and have reinvigorated their
focus on Arctic security. If the United States and its Arctic allies
hope to quickly improve security in this vast region, they will need to
expand Arctic awareness in a way that is efficient, is cost effective,
and reduces risk to personnel and critical assets.

New modernized Arctic bases and fleets could expand Arctic awareness,
but they're a tall order, even in the long term. The Arctic is a very
harsh environment for ground forces, and expensive naval vessels and
manned aircraft cannot safely and efficiently cover the region without
backup. For example, manned aircraft traditionally need a secondary
rescue capacity in case they go down. This requires costly resources in
terms of additional training, personnel, basing, and aircraft.

However, [[cost-effective, Arctic-ready unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)
may help the allies fill]{.underline}]{.mark} their security [[gaps
today]{.underline}]{.mark}. If a UAS goes down, there is no need for a
rapid rescue mission because the remote pilot and crew are safely on the
ground in another location. As a cost-effective complement to manned
assets, UAS also can remotely fly longer missions using satellite
communications, connect joint forces, and maintain a shared real-time
intelligence picture of the Arctic, reducing the overall cost of
expanded operations and eliminating risks to human pilots or crew.
Leveraging UAS would enable Arctic allies to quickly expand coverage in
the region from anywhere in the world. (Disclosure: I work for General
Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which manufactures one of several such UAS
models.)

Monitoring increased commercial and illegal activity

With climate change's dramatic effects on the Arctic, and the resulting
increased maritime traffic and geopolitical competition for commercial
control, NATO will need continuous airborne situational awareness and
communications within the Alliance and with Arctic partners. [[New
Arctic-ready UAS are ideal assets for conducting such civil operations
in the Arctic. With the ability to withstand extremely low temperatures
and the ability to fly long missions via satellite, Arctic-ready UAS are
well suited for continuously monitoring shipping
lanes]{.underline}]{.mark}, fisheries, and environmental disasters, and
for conducting search and rescue operations. [[More UAS over the Arctic
could enhance cooperation, help ensure the safety of peaceful commercial
activity, and improve climate security]{.underline}]{.mark}.

For example, if a ship is in distress and a UAS is on mission, the
aircraft can easily be tasked to provide video, radar, and
communications relay in support of first responders; the UAS could
potentially deploy life-saving emergency supplies directly. Similarly,
if there are reports of illicit fishing operations and a suspected
vessel turns off its transponder identification, UAS can help
authorities to locate, identify, and apprehend the vessel, removing the
guesswork and initial risks to human patrols.

Arctic-ready UAS can also be valuable research tools for monitoring
wildlife, icemelt, and more to help scientists understand the
environmental and community impacts of climate change, despite
complications brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Before, Russia
and the Arctic 7 were largely able to collaborate on important
environmental research and socio-economic development activities in the
region through the Arctic Council. But due to Russia's invasion, the
Arctic 7 countries have largely isolated Moscow from ongoing activities
at a cost of resources and regional access. [[The use of UAS could help
fill gaps by supporting important airborne research on the impacts of
climate change on Arctic ecosystems and
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Navy and Marine Corps

The Navy has traditionally focused on sub-surface operations in the
Arctic. However, [[rapidly melting Arctic waters]{.underline}]{.mark}
will result in the **[[doubling]{.underline}]{.mark}** of [[seaborne
movement]{.underline}]{.mark} and trade through the region during the
next two decades, uncovering undiscovered natural gas and oil reserves,
and --- despite existing moratoriums43 --- enticing international
fishing fleets into the region.44 The melting Arctic waters also
[[**expose** the northern maritime approaches to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[North America]{.underline}]{.mark}n continent, requiring
[[practical ways to defend and control sea lines]{.mark}]{.underline} of
communication. Both China and Russia are significantly investing in
civilian and military Arctic capabilities to either control or dominate
the region's resources and sea lines of communications.45

The recently released Naval Arctic strategy refocuses the naval services
on enhancing presence in the region and modernizing capabilities to meet
these rising challenges. The Navy should focus on sea control to enhance
deterrence efforts in the Arctic by increasing surface ship presence
there. It should also explore building expeditionary mobile bases that
could be used as support stations for air and maritime assets.46 Another
option would be to employ an Expeditionary Sea Base ship to act as a
mobile sea base with a limited four-spot flight deck, providing
forward-based command and control, facilitating access to prepositioned
equipment, enabling employment of Special Operations Forces, and
supporting airborne mine countermeasure capabilities.47

The Marine Corps should support naval deterrence efforts by habitual
deployments of Marine littoral regiments (MLR)48 units into the Arctic.
These MLR units can facilitate sea control and sea denial by employing
small, mobile, long-range anti-ship missiles forces as well as
expeditionary forward arming and refueling of aircraft; ISR coverage of
key maritime terrain; air-defense, and early warning in various regions
of the Arctic. The MLR units' ability to conduct expeditionary advanced
base operations implies the employment of mobile, low-signature, and
relatively easy to sustain Marine amphibious 8 units from austere,
temporary locations across a large area of operation.49 MLR units should
also deploy on board Coast Guard cutters operating in the Arctic to help
establish some strategic ambiguity, distribute lethality, and enhance
these ships' power projection and defensive capabilities, as
appropriate.

The naval services [[should]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[leverage]{.underline}]{.mark}** advances in [[artificial

Unmanned systems have the potential to play an important role in Arctic
security. [[Sea-based and air-based drones can supplement conventional
maritime and aerial capabilities in gathering Arctic situational
awareness, particularly in the maritime domain]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
attack capabilities or close air support, as seen in Ukraine, [[drones
can complement long-range missiles by providing an asymmetric strike
option]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, since the Arctic geography and
climate vastly differ from the Ukrainian, the [[unmanned systems used in
Ukraine may be largely incompatible with Arctic
territory.]{.underline}]{.mark} Range requirements differ depending on
uses, but for situational awareness purposes, for example, drones should
ideally withstand high range in low temperatures.

As discussed, a major factor behind successful drone warfare in Ukraine
has been the cost-efficiency of drones, which further enables
scalability and strength in numbers. Given the constraints of Arctic
geography, [[the current availability of unmanned systems that
cost-efficiently fulfill the above-mentioned criteria is
limited]{.underline}]{.mark}. Northrop Grumman's MQ-4C Triton is the
most frequently mentioned aerial high-altitude long-endurance drone
alternative for Arctic states. While systems such as the MQ-4C Triton
would certainly bolster maritime domain awareness, they do not
accurately exemplify the benefits of drone warfare as demonstrated in
Ukraine. Instead, they represent high-value targets vulnerable to
asymmetric warfare.59 This is not necessarily detrimental to Arctic
states' national security objectives, but [[harnessing the benefits of
drone warfare as seen in Ukraine requires a different line of
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Ukraine has shown how cheaper platforms in higher numbers can make a
difference in high-intensity warfare against Russia. Therefore, [[Arctic
states should be cautious of putting all of their eggs in one basket:
Rather than opting for fewer numbers of expensive drones, which do not
capture the military-technological advantages of evolving drone
capabilities, the Arctic should choose instead to adopt many
less-expensive variations]{.underline}]{.mark}. More on that trade-off
in the recommendation below.

[[Enhancing the frequency and duration of Allied naval forces involves
showing presence and readiness in the Arctic. Persistent naval presence
in the region, built around the Arctic seven and supported by
neighboring Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} -- including the United Kingdom,
Germany, France, the Netherlands, Japan, and South Korea -- [[would
ensure regional forces and national capabilities, cohered under a NATO
umbrella, that are better synchronized and thus more effective
particularly on, below, and above Arctic waters, including task group
operations in the Barents Sea and in the Bear Gap. This would not only
maximize extant capabilities, drive operational efficiency and
effectiveness, but also]{.underline}]{.mark} -- when supported by
additional mass and specific Arctic capabilities held at readiness as
well as adequate strategic communication -- more [[effectively signal
Allied cohesion and will]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, increasing
presence begs the question of where such presence should occur. For
example, should Allied forces begin to turn towards the Pacific to deter
increasing Chinese and Russian presence in the Bering Strait? Moreover,
how far should INDOPACOM and NORTHCOM, supported by Asian partners, go
into the Arctic Ocean? These questions also raise important C2 issues
such as how NATO, NORAD, EUCOM, INDOPACOM, and other multilateral and
bilateral (or binational) activities can better be synchronized and
coordinated in different parts of the Arctic. Answering these questions
is key to creating an integrated naval deterrent posture in the
Arctic.While Russia has a naval advantage due to shorter lines of
communication and geographic advantage in its Arctic region, the Allies
can overcome this shortcoming through an alignment and synchronization
of multilateral presence through, for example, exercises. Importantly,
over-exercising can be expensive, overbearing, and hard to maintain.
Therefore, we suggest shared multilateral patrols along EEZs and
demonstrations on a more regular basis in tandem with the continuation
of regular NATO exercises (e.g., Trident Juncture and Cold Response) to
demonstrate cohesion of Allied intent and capabilities. When exercises
do occur, we suggest a particular emphasis on exercising against hybrid
attacks on critical maritime infrastructure to demonstrate our readiness
to respond to, and our resiliency against these threats.

Trump's interest in Greenland is often associated with the island's
vast, but largely untapped, mineral resources. But its strategic
location is arguably an even greater asset. [[Shipping routes through
the Arctic have become more dependable and for longer periods of time
during the year as a result of melting sea ice.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
northwest passage (along the US and Canadian shorelines) and the
northeast passage (along Russia's Arctic coast) are often ice free now
during the summer.

[[This has increased opportunities for commercial
shipping]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, the distance for a container
ship from Asia to Europe through the northeast passage can be up to
three times shorter, compared to traditional routes through the Suez
Canal or around Africa.

Similarly, the northwest passage offers the shortest route between the
east coast of the United States and Alaska. [[Add to that the likely
substantial resources that the Arctic has, from oil and gas to minerals,
and the entire region is beginning to look like a giant real estate deal
in the making]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Arctic assets

[[The economic promise of the Arctic, and particularly the region's
greater accessibility, have also heightened]{.underline}]{.mark}
military and security [[sensitivities]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The day before J.D. Vance's visit to Greenland on March 28, Vladimir
Putin, gave a speech at the sixth international Arctic forum in Murmansk
in Russia's high north, warning of increased geopolitical rivalry.

While he claimed that "Russia has never threatened anyone in the
Arctic", he was also quick to emphasise that Moscow was "enhancing the
combat capabilities of the Armed Forces, and modernising military
infrastructure facilities" in the Arctic.

Equally worrying, Russia has increased its naval cooperation with China
and given Beijing access, and a stake, in the Arctic. In April 2024, the
two countries' navies signed a cooperation agreement on search and
rescue missions on the high seas.

In September 2024, China participated in Russia's largest naval
manoeuvres in the post-cold war era, Ocean-2024, which were conducted in
north Pacific and Arctic waters. The following month, Russian and
Chinese coastguard vessels conducted their first joint patrol in the
Arctic. Vance, therefore, has a point when he urges Greenland and
Denmark to cut a deal with the US because the "island isn't safe".

That [[the Russia-China partnership has resulted in an increasingly
military presence in the Arctic has not gone
unnoticed]{.underline}]{.mark} in the west. [[Worried about the security
of its Arctic territories]{.underline}]{.mark}, Canada has just
announced a C\$6 billion (£3.2 billion) upgrade to facilities in the
North American Aerospace Defense Command it operates jointly with the

[[It will]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[acquire more

important]{.underline}]{.mark} for it [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} include
Arctic requirements as part of its modernization priorities: long-range
precision fires, next generation combat vehicles, future vertical lift,
network, air missile defense, and soldier lethality.36

The unique environment of the Arctic will require developing concepts
for operating there that will, in turn, drive the requirements and
capability development that support mobility and sustainment of its
modernization platforms in Arctic conditions.37 Improving Arctic
capabilities across the force is a priority in the Army's Arctic
strategy. The Army's proponent for cold-region training is the Northern
Warfare Training Center (NWTC) at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. NWTC provides
essential training to unit leaders and individual soldiers, enabling
small unit operations in cold-weather environments and mountainous
terrain. However, the Army should also look to invest in training
complexes that will enhance its ability to exercise command and control
and combined arms maneuver of the Arcticcapable units they are building.

The Army will also need to work with the other services to improve
operational effectiveness as well as reduce sustainment demands in the
Arctic region. The Army should continue to advance collaboration on
Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) with the Air
Force and naval services, and consider how best to fold in the Coast
Guard, as appropriate. The substantial presence of all the services in
Alaska will allow for multi-domain formations to experiment and train to
achieve true convergence as a joint force. The harsh environment,
extended distances, and inadequate sustainment infrastructure also

Svalbard Archipelago

[[Norway and Russia have]{.underline}]{.mark} a long history of
[[competing claims over]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark} Archipelago (see Figure 3). In 1920, the
countries signed the Svalbard Treaty. It made Svalbard part of the
Kingdom of Norway, but Norway must not 'allow the establishment of any
naval bases ... and not construct any fortification in the said
territories, which may never be used for warlike purposes.'14
Additionally, the treaty did little to clarify the administration of the
surrounding waters and the resources contained therein. Major M. N.

paper from USAF Air Command and Staff College, presented this issue well
when he stated '[[a failing and assertive Russia could choose to seize

territory and adjacent waters]{.underline}]{.mark} directly or to
improve their position in post-conflict settlement of the status of
Svalbard and adjacent waters.'15

If Russia were to seek to control Svalbard through military
intervention, [[it would qualify as an Article 5 violation and require
NATO to defend]{.underline}]{.mark} the territory of
[[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}. While it would not be in the interest of
either side to escalate hostilities outside the immediate Svalbard
region, [[spill over into other theatres could be
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since this would be a limited conflict
and neither deterrence nor de-escalation would be the main aim, it is
likely both sides would be motivated to stay well below any nuclear
threshold, but that does not preclude armed combat.

Unlike the previous two scenarios, range is not the overwhelming
obstacle. However, [[Svalbard is]{.underline}]{.mark} still over [[1,000
kilometres]{.underline}]{.mark} from Bodo, Norway, and the RAP must
extend to cover this region. [[Air operations would
face]{.underline}]{.mark} the same [[difficulties]{.underline}]{.mark}
as in the first scenario, only to a lesser extent.

A conflict over Svalbard would likely be drawn out, due to both the
climate and to [[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} desire to play to their
strength. Its [[military has far more experience operating in the arctic
conditions than NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia would not have to
forward-deploy many of its units due to its bases on the Kola Peninsula,
Novaya Zemlya, and Franz Josef Land, whereas NATO would need to place
numerous units across northern Norway. [[To conduct an extended
campaign]{.underline}]{.mark} to defend or retake Svalbard, NATO must be
prepared to operate from Arctic bases for long periods of time. This
[[would require NATO to provide comprehensive air and maritime
ISR]{.underline}]{.mark}, forward-basing, C2, [[aerial
refuelling]{.underline}]{.mark}, and air transport in the Arctic [[for
an extended timeframe]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Conclusion

The polar ice cap has historically prevented the Arctic Ocean from
routine use, rendering the region largely free from competition. As the
sea ice continues to recede, the Arctic will become more accessible to
fishermen, cruise ships, oil companies, cargo vessels, and even navies.
As an Alliance, we must consider the possibility of conflict. Through
this brief exploratory analysis, it is evident [[situational awareness
through air and maritime ISR in this emerging global common would prove
vitally important]{.underline}]{.mark} in any conflict situation.
Additionally, C2, strike, and air transport missions at the long ranges
seen in the Arctic will have a heavy aerial refuelling demand. Finally,
NATO must plan, train and exercise the forward-basing of forces in
hostile environments across the spectrum of conflict in order to prepare
for an Arctic contingency. [[Currently]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the majority of its [[member states are
unprepared]{.underline}]{.mark} to conduct the operations discussed
above. While, of course, it is preferable to limit military activity in
the Arctic, it would be imprudent to dismiss the possibility of
hostilities in this increasingly accessible global common.

Spinning the globe again, we travel north 4,000 nautical miles to
Svalbard, Norway. This was the site of a number of military operations
during World War II, most importantly as key maritime terrain for
Germany to maintain war weather stations. Svalbard is 550 nautical miles
north of Murmansk and adjacent to the Barents Sea, where Russia is
constructing artificial islands[[. Svalbard is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[home to the Doomsday Vault for]{.underline}]{.mark} the world's
[[seeds]{.underline}]{.mark}. It has the northern-most set of undersea
cables that are likely to be networked as the arctic continues to melt
in an effort to reduce latency. [[This is not a region unfamiliar to the

its persistent presence in Norway conducting

suggest a modification to deter Russia and continue cooperation with our

augmented by persistent presence. Moreover, last year [Russia conducted

[The [Svalbard]{.mark} Global [Seed Vault]{.mark} was [built to help us
through the end of the world]{.mark}. But nobody expected that hints of
[doomsday would arrive quite so soon]{.mark}. The seed [bank stores the
crops and plants from around the world]{.mark} on a frozen island in
Norway, [protecting biodiversity.]{.mark}]{.underline} At least it was
frozen until recently -- when the permafrost that was thought to be a
reliable blanket around it started to melt. Permafrost, as its name
suggests, isn't supposed to go anywhere. When it melted, it served as a
reminder that even those supposed temples of security that preserve our
[[biodiversity are at risk]{.underline}]{.mark} -- that climate change
and other threats are putting the entire world in danger, even the
[[parts that we'll rely on to save us]{.underline}]{.mark} from that
very same danger. Now the Norwegian government is spending more money to
protect the Svalbard bank, located on Spitsbergen, about 800 miles from
the North Pole, upgrading its security to ensure that it is entirely
waterproof and ready for whatever is thrown at it. The crypt -- so often
referred to as a "[doomsday vault" -- is working to avoid its own
downfall. But those behind the Svalbard facility prefer to avoid the
name "doomsday vault" -- not because it is inaccurate]{.underline},
necessarily, but really because it's too accurate. The [[vault is
intended as a fail-safe]{.underline}]{.mark}, but we've already failed.
"'I don't like the name," says Marie Haga, executive director of the
Crop Trust, which looks after the bank. Seed bank built to withstand end
of the world already having trouble "When you are concerned about
[safeguarding [biodiversity, crop diversity,]{.mark} then the [loss of
just one variety might be catastrophic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because
that might have been the [[variety that could solve big
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}. So [there are doomsdays happening all the
time]{.underline}." One such event has arrived in Syria in recent years;
as well as the complete destruction of the homes and lives of people
living in the country, the genebank in Aleppo was destroyed. Thankfully
those seeds had been backed up by the Svalbard vault -- and the Aleppo
seeds are the only withdrawal to have been made from that crypt. There
was no such luck for the seed banks in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were
mostly destroyed by war. Some of the seeds they looked after had been
saved and taken to the seed bank run by the International Centre for
Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, in Syria, before war arrived and
destroyed that seed bank too[. [Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark} [might be
the most famous seed bank in the world, and [the figurehead of a mission
to protect the huge diversity of plant life]{.mark} on
Earth.]{.underline} But it is just one of a global network of 1700,
spread all across the world, each of them protecting and securing the
biodiversity of the countries they call home. The Millennium Seed Bank
looks, from the ground, like any other office complex built in the
countryside: beautifully designed, curved rows of almost-sheds. As you'd
expect from Kew, it's surrounded by lush plants, including in
picturesque ponds that sit outside the buildings. But lurking beneath
there is a structure built to last the very worst that the world can
throw at it. Two storeys beneath the offices are vaults, made up of
concrete designed to last for 500 years. It is packed with all sorts of
different measures[: humidity sensors watching for the possibility of
flooding, despite the fact that the location was chosen because it is
high up on a sandstone ridge and should be safe from water. The walls
are thick enough to withstand a plane crash -- not an entirely
theoretical measure, given Gatwick is about 20 minutes
away.]{.underline} Inside those vaults are hidden seeds that could one
day be used for breakthrough work on the plants that keep us alive. The
Svalbard seed bank is just one of a global network of 1700 The Svalbard
Global Seed Vault, on the other hand, looks a lot more deserving of its
doomsday moniker. Its door stick up through the ice like a spacecraft
landed on some frozen planet, jagged edges ripping into the cold
Norwegian air. [The vault itself a place of immense natural security and
protection.]{.underline} It looks less like a centre of scientific study
and more like a crypt, albeit one with the explicit aim of bringing
those who are stored inside it back to life. Inside the mountain that
houses the vault it is very cold, around -4C, meaning that less work
needs to be done to cool the seeds down to the required -16C for
storage. In the event of a catastrophic event that knocks the power
offline, the seeds can only warm to around -4C and will therefore be
better preserved. Getting to the vault itself is also very difficult:
Spitsbergen is a very cold, very harsh island, home to a local community
who look after it. "So [the location itself is its own security
measure," says Haga. It's also not at particular risk of earthquakes,
volcanoes or other natural disasters, and is 120m above sea
level.]{.underline} "It is harder to think of a safer place on the globe
to have a vault than this." But even this vault, built to protect its
important deposits from the end of the world, has been threatened by the
pace and power of global warming. Last year, the permafrost that
surrounds the vault started melting, and that water began to find its
way into the tunnel that leads to the vault. "When we have had a bit of
water coming into the tunnel leading to the vault, it is because the
permafrost has not come back around the tunnel, as we have expected,"
says Haga. "That's due to a hotter climate -- so climate change has
actually contributed to the need for this upgrade." Now the Norwegian
government has announced that it will spend \$13m (£9.4m) -- more than
it cost to build the vault -- on protecting and securing it. "When the
vault was constructed 10 or 11 years ago, no one would even have
considered that the permafrost would not be permanent in Svalbard," says
Haga. "Climate change has gone much faster than expected -- the fact of
the matter is that back then you couldn't have imagined that the
permafrost would not have come back." "[It's fair to say that
agriculture has never ever faced such big challenges as it does
today]{.underline}," she adds. "That is partly due to population growth,
but more importantly due to climate change. "The basic problem for food
production these days is that the climate changes faster than the plants
that feed us are able to adapt." Jonas Mueller, senior research leader
in seed conservation at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, recognises the
proximity and potency of those threats. But looking out from the
Millennium Seed Bank he is optimistic: "the message is positive", he
says. ["Yes, there are all the threats to what we call [plant
diversity]{.mark} -- from our own own figures, we know that about [21
per cent of them are threatened with extinction]{.mark} over the next 30
years or so. That hasn't changed, new data has only confirmed
that]{.underline}." He recognises that there are a range of different
threats to that diversity, including agriculture, logging and more, all
of which contributes to the "traumatic changes" the world is
experiencing. "Plants, and plant diversity, are on the losing side of
that." But the existence of places like the seed vault are a
demonstration of the positive work, too. "The good news is that we have
all this technology in our hands to ensure that no species needs to go
extinct," says Mueller. "That [one plant species might be the solution
to whatever particularly bad disease, or it might lead to a new crop
variety]{.underline}," he adds. In that respect, plant conservation
isn't necessarily about keeping the plants we currently need. It's about
keeping plants that we might need in the future -- because [[we don't
know what unimagined benefits they will give us one
day]{.underline}]{.mark}. "You could say that [[conservation of this
diversity is to safeguard options]{.underline}]{.mark}," says Haga.
"It's to give us options in the future -- [[for each variety we lose, we
lose options]{.underline}]{.mark}." Crops that are suitable for the
climate of a country in the present, may, because of climate change,
become unsuitable in the future. If, for example, southern Europe
continues to warm then its own wheat might not survive. One solution
would be to import crops that flourish in intense weather from North
Africa. It's a way of thinking that could become life-saving in the
future. Both Mueller and Haga are keen to stress that their work is
governed by important international agreements ensuring each country
owns its own seeds. So the country that collected the wheat crops would
have to assent to having them used in Spain, for instance. "Wheat
originates in the Middle East -- in Syria, probably," says Haga. "Now we
grow wheat all over the world, but it took 12,000 years for it to move
around. "Now climate change goes so fast that these poor plants aren't
able to adapt. That's why breeding becomes so important, and hopefully
allows us to find varieties that could help us in the future." Indeed
part of [[the vaults' mission is to ensure that we still have access to
flowers that could]{.underline}]{.mark} one day [[become a miracle cure
for disease]{.underline}]{.mark}, or [[crops that are able to withstand
temperatures, pests]{.mark}, diseases or just taste better than what we
have today. Thankfully the protective technology developed in the last
decade has progressed at the same rapid rate as the horrifying threats.
"Just imagine what techniques a plant scientist had 50 years ago," says
Mueller. "And what techniques we can now use, and what techniques we
will have in 50 years time. "Those seeds we collect today will still be
available, and in many cases I don't know what their uses might
be."]{.underline}

[[Arctic security can be characterised as]{.underline}]{.mark} a nexus
between [[multipolar nuclear conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} and climate
change. Multipolarity is defined as a global balance of power between
multiple actors \[3\]. [[Climate Change]{.underline}]{.mark} is making
seaways and resources more accessible, which is leading to a thawing of
[[territorial conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} which were formerly frozen
\[4\]. China's increasing [[economic interests]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the Arctic means it must be considered as a regional actor despite its
near-regional status \[5\]. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has recently
[[threatened to use nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} against the
United States (U.S.) [[due to]{.underline}]{.mark} its objections to
Russia's invasion of [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}; this sets a
precedent for heightened nuclear tension in the Arctic, which is the
most nuclearized area in the world and has seen a steady buildup of
nuclear and conventional forces by regional actors \[6\]. These factors
[[have led to direct tensions between three major nuclear
actors]{.underline}]{.mark} (namely, NATO, China, and Russia) in a
region that is becoming increasingly competitive \[7\]. These tensions
cannot be adequately explained by existing deterrence models, which rely
on Cold War-era bipolar game theory \[8\]. Due to climate change,
geopolitical tension, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, nuclear
relations in the Arctic are unstable and present serious security risks
that cannot be contended with through the use of classic deterrence
theory \[9\].

ARCTIC GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE

The Arctic region is 66.5° north of the equator and encompasses the
United States, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and
Iceland, all of whom are members of the region's governing body, the
Arctic Council \[10\]. The region's international legal status currently
lies under the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea,
however, due to climate change, polar ice is melting, making the region
more accessible by sea and opening up its vast oil and gas deposits for
extraction by regional actors \[11\].

Sino-Russian cooperation along sea routes has given
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} significant influence in the region, which
it [[wants]{.underline}]{.mark} to develop into [[a "Polar Silk Road" as
outlined in]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[2018]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic
White Paper \[12\]. [[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} development
[[interests do not align with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}'s geopolitical
goals in the Arctic, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} China's ownership over
Arctic infrastructure [[represents an economic
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to Russian interests \[13\]. There is
growing competition between these regional actors which is exacerbated
by overlapping territorial boundary claims by Denmark, Canada, and
Russia. In addition, the Arctic Council has suspended cooperation due to
its chairmanship by Russia until the end of 2023 \[14\].

DETERRENCE AND ARCTIC NUCLEAR RELATIONS

[[Classic nuclear deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} is steeped in Cold War
bipolarity and [[relies on two rational actors]{.underline}]{.mark}
basing their decisions on what they believe their opponents\' actions
will be \[15\]. Classic deterrence is expressed through the Chicken Game
\[16\]. As seen in the figure below, a player's options are to defect
and pursue a foreign policy objective or to cooperate and maintain the
status quo \[17\]. The best outcome for an actor is to defect against a
cooperating partner; however, this runs the risk of both players
defecting, leading to nuclear annihilation \[18\].

This classic deterrence game does [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} contend
with the possibility of conflict between [[multiple nuclear
actors]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is a key feature of Arctic security
\[19\]. Though a three-player chicken game has been applied to
theoretical problems, such as two out of three players needing to
complete a task that all would rather not complete, this model has yet
to be applied to nuclear relations \[20\]. [[China, NATO, the U.S., and
Russia's nuclear doctrines]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[informed by
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} theory, which [[is problematic due to
the theory's assumption of a bipolar world order]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[21\].

Nuclear multipolarity in the Arctic is unstable because it no longer
falls within the traditional game theory matrix, and [[there is an
increased risk of nuclear action due to a **larger number** of nuclear
actors and significant regional tension]{.mark}]{.underline} \[22\].
Preemptive nuclear strikes are more prevalent in multipolar nuclear
politics due to a greater perception of threat from other actors \[23\].
Though China promotes itself as a No First Use (NFU) state, meaning that
it will not strike unless struck upon in a nuclear capacity, Russia has
threatened to strike first, and America's position on NFU is vague
\[24\]. NATO is a nuclear deterrent organisation in the Arctic region,
only Sweden is not yet a full NATO member and Finland has just recently
gained NATO membership \[25\]. In multipolar deterrence, regional
conflicts are more likely to escalate into total nuclear warfare, and
de-escalation relies on political bargaining as opposed to rationality
modelling. Thus, it is unclear how political bargaining will take place
in an increasingly polarised Arctic \[26\].

Though the U.S., China, and Russia have all acceded to or ratified the
Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NNPT), [[both Russia
and the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[backed out
of]{.underline}]{.mark} data-sharing obligations under the [[New
START]{.underline}]{.mark} treaty \[27\]. [[This **breakdown in
communication** between Arctic actors due to Russia's invasion of
Ukraine,]{.underline}]{.mark} and Russia's recent threat to use nuclear
weapons against the U.S. [[indicates]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[future
regional disputes over Arctic resources, navigation, and territory may
give rise to **nuclear crises**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[28\].

CONCLUSION

Climate change in [[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} has rendered the
region more accessible to its actors; this has **[[inflamed
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the NATO bloc and Russia [[over
territorial disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} and Russia's war in Ukraine
and between China [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia due to [[diverging
economic]{.underline}]{.mark} development [[goals]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[29\]. As temperatures warm, the region [[may become a **nuclear
flashpoint**]{.underline}]{.mark} that cannot be analysed using classic
deterrent models \[30\].

More [[aggressive posturing by Russia and China in the fast-melting
Arctic is raising red flags]{.underline}]{.mark} for the Pentagon.

Russia is working to quickly flex its muscle in the region through a
partnership with China to build infrastructure [[along the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}]{.mark}, one of two major shipping lanes across the
Arctic. That agreement, announced exactly a year after Russia invaded
Ukraine, was viewed by experts as a signal that Russia and China
increasingly share economic interests in the icy polar region.

Then in August, [[a fleet of 11 Russian and Chinese warships
sailed]{.underline}]{.mark} from the Sea of Japan
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Bering]{.underline}]{.mark} Strait
[[into the Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark} Ocean, passing [[close
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S.-held [[Aleutian
Islands]{.underline}]{.mark} off the Alaskan coast. The Russian news
agency Interfax said the ships were [[conducting]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"[[joint anti-submarine]{.underline}]{.mark} and anti-aircraft
[[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

"Russia has a heavy emphasis on the Arctic, and over half of it is in
Russian territory," Iris Ferguson, deputy assistant secretary of Defense
for Arctic and global resilience, said in an interview with E&E News. "I
don't want to suggest they don't have a place there. But we are
concerned about increasing levels of investment in Arctic military
capabilities.\" Those realities require a reset of U.S. Defense
Department policies in the Arctic region, including "changes in how
we're training and equipping \[U.S. forces\] and rethinking the kinds of
operations we need to have there," Ferguson said. Elements of those
changes will be laid out in DOD\'s Arctic strategy, expected to be
released this month. The document will replace a 2019 version released
three years before Russia invaded Ukraine, effectively alienating itself
from seven partner Arctic nations: the United States, Canada, Norway,
Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland. Experts noted China does not have
territory in the Arctic but seeks access and influence in the region,
something it hopes to advance through its Russian alliance. Diplomatic
relations among Arctic countries are often handled through the
eight-member Arctic Council, whose chairmanship rotates every two years.
Russia chaired the council from 2021 to 2023 and was shunned after its
Ukraine invasion. Norway assumed the chairmanship in May. The Biden
administration is strengthening its focus on the region by creating
senior positions to oversee Arctic policy, including the one held by
Ferguson, who assumed the role last year. It also created a senior State
Department position and named Mike Sfraga, chair of the U.S. Arctic
Research Commission, to be ambassador-at-large. The Senate has yet to
confirm his nomination. After the Russia-China war game off Alaska last
summer, U.S. Marines joined roughly 4,000 NATO-affiliated troops for a
military exercise in the Baltic Sea. The November exercise was led by
Finland, its first since joining NATO. It came as Congress authorized
\$200 million in infrastructure spending at military bases in Alaska,
where experts say climate warming is placing additional stress on aging
facilities, which often date back to the World War II era. The largest
Alaska item in the National Defense Authorization Act is a \$107.5
million runway extension at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, home to
22,000 military personnel and the Alaskan Command, including the North
American Aerospace Defense Command. The Army was awarded \$34 million to
build new housing at Fort Richardson near Fairbanks. Eielson Air Force
Base, south of Fairbanks, will receive \$9.5 million to build a new
dormitory to replace old, substandard, energy-sucking barracks. Eielson
also is home to the Air Force\'s 354th Fighter Wing, nicknamed the
"Icemen," with two combat-ready squadrons of F-35A Lightning II fighter
jets to patrol the polar region. Ferguson said the infrastructure
projects will be designed and built to account for climate warming
impacts like thawing permafrost. She added that her office provides new
levels of coordination among individual branch services, each of which
has its own Arctic climate action plan. "Honestly, creating a crossroads
for everyone to go to within the \[Defense\] department is pretty
significant," she said. "Prior to the establishment of our office, our
outside partners didn't have a place to go when they wanted to talk
Arctic issues. Fortunately, the bulk of our partners are highly
geopolitically aligned and have high levels of military capability."

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Erin Sikorsky, director of the Center for Climate and Security and the
International Military Council on Climate and Security, said in an
interview that the risk of open hostilities between the U.S. and Russia
or China is unlikely. But tensions could rise over issues of territorial
encroachment in a region shared by eight countries.

"[[The overarching risk]{.underline}]{.mark} I see is a warming Arctic
[[is a busier Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}," Sikorsky said. "The backdrop
to that is the increased geopolitical competition between NATO and
Russia or the U.S. and China. I worry that the [[increased presence in

In early March, an estimated 7,500 American combat troops will travel to
Norway to join thousands of soldiers from other NATO countries in a
massive mock battle with imagined invading forces from Russia. In this
futuristic simulated engagement---it goes by the name of [[Exercise Cold
Response]{.underline}]{.mark} 2020---allied forces will "conduct
multinational joint exercises with a high-intensity combat scenario in
demanding winter conditions," or so claims the Norwegian military
anyway. At first glance, this may look like any other NATO training
exercise, but think again. There's nothing ordinary about Cold Response
2020. As a start, it's being staged above the Arctic Circle, far from
any previous traditional NATO battlefield, and it raises to a new level
the possibility of a great-power conflict that [[might end in a nuclear
exchange and mutual annihilation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Welcome, in other
words, to World War III's newest battlefield.

For the soldiers participating in the exercise, the potentially
thermonuclear dimensions of Cold Response 2020 may not be obvious. At
its start, [[Marines]{.underline}]{.mark} from the United States and the
United Kingdom [[will practice massive amphibious landings along
Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}'s coastline, much as they do in similar
exercises elsewhere in the world. Once ashore, however, the scenario
becomes ever more distinctive. After collecting tanks
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} other heavy weaponry "prepositioned" in caves
in Norway's interior, the Marines will [[proceed
toward]{.underline}]{.mark} the country's far-northern
[[Finnmark]{.underline}]{.mark} region to help Norwegian forces stave
off Russian forces supposedly pouring across the border. From then on,
the two sides will engage in---to use current Pentagon
terminology---high-intensity combat operations under Arctic conditions
(a type of warfare not seen on such a scale since World War II).

And that's just the beginning. Unbeknownst to most Americans, the
[[Finnmark]{.underline}]{.mark} region of Norway and adjacent Russian
territory [[have become one of the most likely battlegrounds for the
first use of nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} in any future
NATO-Russian conflict. Because Moscow has concentrated a significant
part of its nuclear retaliatory capability [[on the Kola
Peninsula]{.underline}]{.mark}, a remote stretch of land abutting
northern Norway---any US-NATO success in actual combat with Russian
forces near that territory would endanger a significant part of Russia's
nuclear arsenal and so might precipitate the early use of such
munitions. Even a simulated victory---the predictable result of Cold
Response 2020---will undoubtedly set Russia's nuclear controllers on
edge.

To appreciate just how risky any NATO-Russian clash in Norway's far
north would be, consider the region's geography and the strategic
factors that have led Russia to concentrate so much military power
there. And all of this, by the way, will be playing out [[in the context
of]{.underline}]{.mark} another [[existential]{.underline}]{.mark}
danger: [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}. The melting of the Arctic
ice cap and the accelerated exploitation of Arctic resources are lending
this area ever greater strategic significance.

Energy Extraction in the Far North

Look at any map of Europe and you'll note that Scandinavia widens as it
heads southward into the most heavily populated parts of Denmark,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden. As you head north, however, it narrows and
becomes ever less populated. At its extreme northern reaches, only a
thin band of Norway juts east to touch [[Russia's Kola
Peninsula]{.underline}]{.mark}. To the north, the Barents Sea, an
offshoot of the Arctic Ocean, bounds them both. This remote
region---approximately 800 miles from Oslo and 900 miles from
Moscow---has, in recent years, become a vortex of economic and military
activity.

Once prized [[as a source of vital minerals, especially nickel, iron
ore, and phosphates]{.underline}]{.mark}, this remote area
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [[now the center of]{.underline}]{.mark}
extensive [[oil and]{.underline}]{.mark} natural [[gas
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}. With temperatures rising in the Arctic
twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet and sea ice retreating ever
farther north every year, offshore fossil-fuel exploration has become
increasingly viable. As a result, large reserves of oil and natural
gas---the very fuels whose combustion is responsible for those rising
temperatures---have been discovered beneath the Barents Sea and both
countries are seeking to exploit those deposits. Norway has taken the
lead, establishing at Hammerfest in Finnmark the world's first plant
above the Arctic Circle to export liquified natural gas. In a similar
fashion, Russia has initiated efforts to exploit the mammoth Shtokman
gas field in its sector of the Barents Sea, though it has yet to bring
such plans to fruition.

For Russia, even more significant oil and gas prospects lie further east
in the Kara and Pechora Seas and on the Yamal Peninsula, a slender
extension of Siberia. Its energy companies have, in fact, already begun
producing oil at the Prirazlomnoye field in the Pechora Sea and the
Novoportovskoye field on that peninsula (and natural gas there as well).
Such fields hold great promise for Russia, which exhibits all the
characteristics of a petro-state, but there's one huge problem: The only
practical way to get that output to market is via specially designed
icebreaker-tankers sent through the Barents Sea past northern Norway.

The exploitation of Arctic oil and gas resources and their transport to
markets in Europe and Asia has become a major economic priority for
Moscow as its hydrocarbon reserves below the Arctic Circle begin to dry
up. Despite calls at home for greater economic diversity, President
Vladimir Putin's regime continues to insist on the centrality of
hydrocarbon production to the country's economic future. In that
context, [[production]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic has become an
essential national objective, which, in turn,
[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} assured [[access]{.underline}]{.mark} to
the Atlantic Ocean [[via the Barents Sea]{.underline}]{.mark} and
Norway's offshore waters. Think of that waterway as vital to Russia's
energy economy in the way the Strait of Hormuz, connecting the Persian
Gulf to the Indian Ocean, is to the Saudis and other regional
fossil-fuel producers.

The Military Dimension

No less than Russia's giant energy firms, its navy must be able to enter
the Atlantic via the Barents Sea and northern Norway. Aside from its
Baltic and Black Sea ports, accessible to the Atlantic only via
passageways easily obstructed by NATO, the [[sole Russian harbor
with]{.underline}]{.mark} unfettered [[access to the
Atlantic]{.underline}]{.mark} Ocean [[is at
Murmansk]{.underline}]{.mark} on the Kola Peninsula. Not surprisingly
then, that port is also the headquarters for Russia's Northern
Fleet---its most powerful---and the site of numerous air, infantry,
missile, and radar bases along with naval shipyards and nuclear
reactors. In other words, [[it's]{.underline}]{.mark} among [[the most
sensitive military regions in Russia today]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Given all this, President Putin has substantially rebuilt that very
fleet, which fell into disrepair after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
equipping it with some of the country's most advanced warships. In 2018,
according to The Military Balance, a publication of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies, it already possessed the largest number
of modern cruisers and destroyers (10) of any Russian fleet, along with
22 attack submarines and numerous support vessels. Also in the Murmansk
area are dozens of advanced MiG fighter planes and a wide assortment of
anti-aircraft defense systems. Finally, as 2019 ended, Russian military
officials indicated for the first time that they had deployed to the
Arctic the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, a weapon capable of
hypersonic velocities (more than five times the speed of sound), again
presumably to a base in the Murmansk region just 125 miles from Norway's
Finnmark, the site of the upcoming NATO exercise.

More significant yet is the way Moscow has been strengthening its
nuclear forces in the region. Like the United States, Russia maintains a
"triad" of nuclear delivery systems, including intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs), long-range "heavy" bombers, and
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Under the terms of the
New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), signed by the two
countries in 2010, the Russians can deploy no more than 700 delivery
systems capable of carrying no more than 1,550 warheads. (That pact
will, however, expire in February 2021 unless the two sides agree to an
extension, which appears increasingly unlikely in the age of Trump.)
According to the Arms Control Association, the Russians are currently
believed to be deploying the warheads they are allowed under New START
on 66 heavy bombers, 286 ICBMs, and 12 submarines with 160 SLBMs. Eight
of those nuclear-armed subs are, in fact, assigned to the Northern
Fleet, which means about 110 missiles with as many as 500 warheads---the
exact numbers remain shrouded in secrecy---are deployed in the Murmansk
area.

[[For Russian nuclear strategists]{.underline}]{.mark}, such
nuclear-armed [[submarines are]{.underline}]{.mark} considered [[the
most "survivable]{.underline}]{.mark}" of the country's retaliatory
systems. In the event of a nuclear exchange with the United States, the
country's heavy bombers and ICBMs could prove relatively vulnerable to
pre-emptive strikes as their locations are known and can be targeted by
American bombs and missiles with near-pinpoint accuracy. Those subs,
however, can leave Murmansk and disappear into the wide Atlantic Ocean
at the onset of any crisis and so presumably remain hidden from US
spying eyes. [[To do so]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[requires that
they pass through]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Barents]{.underline}]{.mark} Sea, avoiding the NATO forces lurking
nearby. [[For Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}, in other words, the very
possibility of [[deterring]{.underline}]{.mark} a US nuclear strike
[[hinges on its ability to defend]{.underline}]{.mark} its naval
stronghold in [[Murmansk]{.underline}]{.mark}, while
[[maneuvering]{.underline}]{.mark} its submarines
[[past]{.underline}]{.mark} Norway's [[Finnmark]{.underline}]{.mark}
region. No wonder, then, that this area has assumed enormous strategic
importance for Russian military planners---and the upcoming Cold
Response 2020 is sure to prove challenging to them.

Washington's Arctic Buildup

During the Cold War era, Washington viewed the Arctic as a significant
strategic arena and constructed a string of military bases across the
region. Their main aim: to intercept Soviet bombers and missiles
crossing the North Pole on their way to targets in North America. After
the Soviet Union imploded in 1991, Washington abandoned many of those
bases. Now, however, with the Pentagon once again identifying "great
power competition" with Russia and China as the defining characteristic
of the present strategic environment, many of those bases are being
reoccupied and new ones established. Once again, the Arctic is being
viewed as a potential site of conflict with Russia and, as a result, US
forces are being readied for possible combat there.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was the first official to explain this
new strategic outlook at the Arctic Forum in Finland last May. In his
address, a kind of "Pompeo Doctrine," he indicated that the United
States was shifting from benign neglect of the region to aggressive
involvement and militarization. "We're entering a new age of strategic
engagement in the Arctic," he insisted, "complete with new threats to
the Arctic and its real estate, and to all of our interests in that
region." To better protect those interests against Russia's military
buildup there, "we are fortifying America's security and diplomatic
presence in the area...hosting military exercises, strengthening our
force presence, rebuilding our icebreaker fleet, expanding Coast Guard
funding, and creating a new senior military post for Arctic Affairs
inside of our own military."

The Pentagon has been unwilling to provide many details, but a close
reading of the military press suggests that this activity has been
particularly focused on northern Norway and adjacent waters. To begin
with, the Marine Corps has established a permanent presence in that
country, the first time foreign forces have been stationed there since
German troops occupied it during World War II. A detachment of about 330
Marines were initially deployed near the port of Trondheim in 2017,
presumably to help guard nearby caves that contain hundreds of US tanks
and combat vehicles. Two years later, a similarly sized group was then
dispatched to the Troms region above the Arctic Circle and far closer to
the Russian border.

From the Russian perspective, even more threatening is the construction
of a US radar station on the Norwegian island of Vardø about 40 miles
from the Kola Peninsula. To be operated in conjunction with the
Norwegian intelligence service, the focus of the facility will evidently
be to snoop on those Russian missile-carrying submarines, assumedly in
order to target them and take them out in the earliest stages of any
conflict. That Moscow fears just such an outcome is evident from the
mock attack it staged on the Vardø facility in 2018, sending 11 Su-24
supersonic bombers on a direct path toward the island. (They turned
aside at the last moment.) It has also moved a surface-to-surface
missile battery to a spot just 40 miles from Vardø.

In addition, in August 2018, the US Navy decided to reactivate the
previously decommissioned Second Fleet in the North Atlantic. "A new
Second Fleet increases our strategic flexibility to respond---from the
Eastern Seaboard to the Barents Sea," said Chief of Naval Operations
John Richardson at the time. As last year ended, that fleet was declared
fully operational.

Deciphering Cold Response 2020

Exercise Cold Response 2020 must be viewed in the context of all these
developments. Few details about the thinking behind the upcoming war
games have been made public, but it's not hard to imagine what at least
part of the scenario might be like: a US-Russian clash of some sort
leading to Russian attacks aimed at seizing that radar station at Vardø
and Norway's defense headquarters at Bodø on the country's northwestern
coast. The invading troops will be slowed but not stopped by Norwegian
forces (and those US Marines stationed in the area), while thousands of
reinforcements from NATO bases elsewhere in Europe begin to pour in.
Eventually, of course, the tide will turn and the Russians will be
forced back.

No matter what the official scenario is like, however, for Pentagon
planners the situation will go far beyond this. Any Russian assault on
critical Norwegian military facilities would presumably be preceded by
intense air and missile bombardment and the forward deployment of major
naval vessels. This, in turn, would prompt comparable moves by the
United States and NATO, probably resulting in violent encounters and the
loss of major assets on all sides. In the process, Russia's key nuclear
retaliatory forces would be at risk and quickly placed on high alert
with senior officers operating in hair-trigger mode. Any misstep might
then lead to what humanity has feared since August 1945: a nuclear
apocalypse on Planet Earth.

There is no way to know to what degree such considerations are
incorporated into the classified versions of the Cold Response 2020
scenario, but it's unlikely that they're missing. Indeed, a 2016 version
of the exercise involved the participation of three B-52 nuclear bombers
from the US Strategic Air Command, indicating that the American military
is keenly aware of the escalatory risks of any large-scale US-Russian
encounter in the Arctic.

In short, what might otherwise seem like a routine training exercise in
a distant part of the world is actually part of an emerging US strategy
to overpower Russia in a critical defensive zone, an approach that could
easily result in nuclear war. The Russians are, of course, well aware of
this and so will undoubtedly be watching Cold Response 2020 with genuine
trepidation. Their fears are understandable---but we should all be
concerned about a strategy that seemingly embodies such a high risk of
future escalation.

Ever [[since]{.underline}]{.mark} the Soviets acquired nuclear weapons
of their own in [[1949, strategists have wondered]{.underline}]{.mark}
how and [[where]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[all-out
nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} war---[[World War
III]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[would break out. At one time,
that]{.underline}]{.mark} incendiary scenario [[was]{.underline}]{.mark}
believed [[most likely]{.underline}]{.mark} to involve a clash over the
divided city of [[Berlin]{.underline}]{.mark} or along the East-West
border in Germany. [[After the Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
fears of such a deadly encounter evaporated and few gave much thought to
such possibilities. Looking forward today, however, the prospect of a
catastrophic World War III is again becoming all too imaginable and this
time, it appears, an incident in [[the Arctic could prove the spark for
Armageddon]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Arctic war go nuclear 

**Shute 23** \[Joe Shute (Ph.D. Researcher, Manchester Metropolitan
University), 9-12-2023, "An Arctic War is Coming," UnHerd,

A similar story is being recorded right across the High North. "Arctic
amplification" is the term meteorologists use for the accelerated rate
of global warming. But the same amplification is occurring with the
geopolitics of the region. The Arctic is melting --- one scientific
study, published in June, claimed that the first summer in which all sea
ice disappears could occur as early as the 2030s --- and, from China to
the US to Putin's Russia, suddenly everyone wants a piece. The era of
"Arctic exceptionalism" declared by Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev
in 1987 is resolutely over, his entreaties for the Arctic to remain a
"zone of peace" free from conflict and exploitation forgotten. As
climate change accelerates and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has cleaved
apart the international order, [[the Arctic has emerged as the potential
theatre of the next global conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Alexander, who also represents the Gwich'in on the Arctic council (which
includes the eight Arctic states, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
Finland, Iceland, the US and Russia) warns that [[the global race to
plunder the Arctic could have devastating
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. "If you don't co-operate on the
Arctic and we don't get these things right, then I'll tell you this, my
friend: the world can change very rapidly."

Russia, whose territory spans around 53% of the Arctic Ocean shoreline,
and China are rapidly developing plans to expand the Northern Sea Route.
The maritime passage between the east and west of the Arctic Ocean is
regarded by the Kremlin as vital to avoid Western sanctions. It is
already possible to navigate the route for anyone with several
briefcases full of dollars to pay for the mandatory Russian ice breakers
which accompany any transit as patrol vessels. In 2024, the Kremlin is
planning to commence year-round navigations of the route, through which
it hopes to increase the amount of cargo shipped from around 30 million
annually to 80 million.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which has ominously declared itself a
"near-Arctic state" --- [[also harbours ambitions
to]{.underline}]{.mark} transform the passage into [[a silk road of the
far north]{.underline}]{.mark}, while in March, a Russian delegation to
India held talks over new co-operation over the route. The West is
similarly flexing its muscles, with Finland (and the expected accession
of Sweden) extending NATO's borders into the Arctic. In June, the US
Secretary of State Anthony [[Blinken announced]{.underline}]{.mark} that
the US would be opening [[an outpost in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
far-north Norwegian town of [[Tromsø]{.underline}]{.mark}, stressing the
need to have "a diplomatic footprint" above the Arctic Circle. "The war
in Ukraine has really torpedoed this idea of Arctic exceptionalism,"
explains Dr Neil Melvin, Director of International Security at the Royal
United Services Institute (RUSI). "The whole focus of [[northern Europe
has]{.underline}]{.mark} basically [[now shifted to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[building security against Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}."

As Melvin points out, the heavy losses sustained by Russia's land army
in Ukraine will force it to become increasingly reliant on its nuclear
forces stationed in the Arctic, where the UK and US have also long
operated their own attack submarines. Russia's Northern Fleet comprises
of a dozen or so nuclear-powered attack submarines as well as surface
vessels, including two heavy nuclear-powered missile battle cruisers. In
recent years, Russia has also reoccupied old Cold War-era Arctic bases
to bolster its presence. "They will feel more vulnerable as a result of
not having a strong army, and I think we are likely to see them threaten
nuclear options much more as part of national defence," Melvin says of
Russia's designs in the Arctic. "They are going to be much more explicit
and threatening."

Beneath the ice, [[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} possesses untold
riches. The region is estimated to [[contain a fifth of the
world's]{.underline}]{.mark} [[undiscovered oil and
gas]{.underline}]{.mark} reserves [[and rare earth elements]{.mark} such
as gold, nickel and zinc]{.underline}. While most of these are present
within the largely undisputed land borders of the Arctic nations, it is
the increasingly navigable international waters [[that present the
**most likely flashpoint**]{.underline}]{.mark}. An ongoing process led
by a United Nations commission is considering sovereignty rights to the
central Arctic Ocean between Russia, Denmark and Canada. While Putin is
cooperating with the process so far, he has also planted a flag in the
most literal sense --- dropping a titanium standard of the Russian
Federation two miles beneath the ocean on the North Pole seabed in 2007.
Fishing rights are also key; as southern oceans heat up, species will
migrate ever further north, causing estimated catches in higher
latitudes to increase by up to 20 per cent by 2050.

According to Professor Klaus Dodds, an expert in geopolitics and ice
studies based at Royal Holloway and author of the recent book, Border
Wars, the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard could prove another area of
conflict. Under a treaty originally signed in 1920, a host of countries
including China and Russia have rights to engage in commercial
activities across Svalbard. Moscow conducts coal mining operations on
the island of Spitsbergen (and insists on referring to Svalbard by the
same name, to emphasise its historic claim on the land). In settlements
such as Barentsburg, Russian is the predominant language.

"The concern is we know [[we have potential flashpoints like
Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark} which, having caused agitation and tension
in the past, [[might be escalated]{.underline}]{.mark} very
[[quickly]{.underline}]{.mark}," Dodds says. Aggression could be
anything from attacks on underwater cables (last year, a Russian trawler
was linked to the severing of a sub-sea fibre-optic cable which linked
Svalbard to the Norwegian mainland), to an outright attack on oil and
gas infrastructure. "The Norwegian European Arctic will be the space
where, if anything, this is most likely to happen," Dodds says. "That
would also be the ultimate opportunity for Russia to test NATO's
resolve."

Regardless of the potential for nuclear conflict, a burning Arctic poses
grave threats for humanity. The Arctic permafrost contains peatland
soils which are the world's most vital carbon sink. Globally, peatlands
store twice as much carbon as all the forests combined. When this burns,
it releases the carbon back into the atmosphere creating something of a
doom loop. According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service,
wildfires across Canada have released 290 megatons of carbon into the
atmosphere between January and August, more than 25% of the global total
for 2023 in the year to date.

Thawing permafrost is also exposing chemical and radioactive waste and
millennia-old "zombie viruses". In 2016, around 100,000 reindeer were
culled in the Russian far north after an anthrax outbreak that killed a
12-year-old boy. Plague bacillus, smallpox and other historic diseases
are also feared to soon re-emerge from the melting earth. The discovery
earlier this summer of 46,000-year-old roundworms lying dormant in
Siberia, which are happily reproducing once again, may hold clues for
adapting to climate change --- but they also raise questions about what
else might venture forth in a thaw. And herein lies the great lesson of
the far north, Professor Dodds explains: nothing here ever happens in
isolation --- there will be wider ramifications across the globe.
"Change in the Arctic is never restricted to the Arctic itself," he
says. "It is almost as if the Arctic strikes back."

The time is long gone where we could think of the Arctic as a great
pristine wilderness. Instead it has become the burning crucible of our
climate crisis. But, as the towering glaciers melt and the seas of the
Earth's fifth largest ocean are revealed to us at last, their future
looks even darker still, reanimating the biological threats of our deep
past, and providing yet another site for human competition and conquest.

#### Arctic competition sparks nuclear war.

njn\]

A potential war zone

[[The Arctic has long been a potential arena for]{.underline}]{.mark}
war, especially [[nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}. American and Russian
submarines stationed there boast intercontinental ballistic missiles and
act as strategic nuclear deterrents. For Moscow, [[the Kola
Peninsula]{.underline}]{.mark} in Russia's far north-west forms a
gateway for vessels from its massive fleet of mainly nuclear-powered
submarines. Through the so-called [[GIUK gap]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
gap between Greenland, Iceland and the UK, Russia's subs can reach the
Atlantic.

Should the Kremlin ever fire [[cruise missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}
toward North America, they [[would fly over the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Likewise, Canada and America's warning
system, stretching [[from Alaska to Newfoundland and
Labrador]{.underline}]{.mark}, would pick up the attack in the Arctic.
And, partly to atone for missing the Chinese surveillance balloon that
reached Alaska in January this year, America and Canada are set to build
new Arctic-scanning radar bases in the north-western US and Ontario. The
main aim of which will be to detect the new hypersonic cruise missiles
that Russia has already used in Ukraine and could one day fire at Canada
and America, via the North Pole.

The Arctic is also the site of potential non-nuclear disputes between
Russia and NATO members. The Kremlin's feared 200th Motor Rifle Brigade
is located only a few kilometres from Russia's short border with Norway
and its much longer one with Finland. Other Russian marines are also
based in the region, including the spetsnaz (special forces). Both units
have suffered severe losses in Ukraine, but their location and their
likely future revival continue to worry Norway. After all, over in
Ukraine, at least seven soldiers from the 200th Motor Rifle Brigade are
wanted for war crimes.

There [[have already been]{.underline}]{.mark} potential
[[flashpoints]{.underline}]{.mark}. When Moscow invaded Ukraine, Norway
blocked Russian exports to Svalbard, a Norwegian Arctic archipelago with
a population of just 2,600 -- including 400 Russians. That led Russia to
threaten unspecified 'retaliatory measures'. Since then, Russo-Norwegian
relations have deteriorated still further. Indeed, northern Norway, home
to nearly 500,000 people and a significant Russian-speaking minority, is
reportedly now a hotbed of Russian espionage. The presence of Russian
drones and spies, surveilling key Norwegian ports, as well as
fibre-optic cables and pipelines, indicates that the Kremlin is already
waging low-level hybrid warfare.

New NATO member Finland also has problems with Russia that stretch into
the Arctic. In November, Finland claimed that Moscow was using asylum
seekers from the Middle East and Africa to infiltrate its borders. It
promptly diverted them all to the remote Raja-Jooseppi border post, 300
kilometres north of the Arctic Circle. Finland has since announced that
it will shut down all border crossings with Russia.

The role of China in the Arctic Circle is also increasing tensions.
Chinese investments and technologies underpin Russian fossil-fuel
extraction and transport in the Arctic. And, although [[China has no
land or sea claims on the Arctic, it declared itself a 'Near-Arctic
State']{.underline}]{.mark} in 2018, invoking the impact of changes in
the Arctic's ecology on China's own ecology.

The Arctic is not just some frozen, neglected backwater. Everybody wants
in. And [[with that comes the risk]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[state-to-state]{.underline}]{.mark}
disputes and [[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The Arctic 7 could also be recipients of ASI

complementary investments [[in greater maritime domain
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} (surface and sub-surface) [[and
situational awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities [[such
as]{.underline}]{.mark} radars and remote [[sensors
for]{.underline}]{.mark} search and rescue, [[**environmental
protection**, and mitigation of climate impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Investments in [[air capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} are equally
[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}. Upon renewal of the US-Danish Defense
Cooperation Agreement (DCA), this should include further investments in
capabilities (including F-35 fighter jets) at Pituffik Space Base
(formerly Thule Air Base) in Greenland. Similarly, the US DCA with
Finland, which is currently under negotiation, could result in
additional infrastructure investments to support the country's F-35
fleet and benefit mutual defense.

[[A high priority should be placed in]{.underline}]{.mark} continued
[[NORAD modernization]{.underline}]{.mark}. As [[recent
incidents]{.underline}]{.mark} involving [[Chinese surveillance balloons
and]{.underline}]{.mark} increased use of [[UAVs have
demonstrated]{.underline}]{.mark}, NORAD has [[severe gaps in
coverage]{.underline}]{.mark} that need to be addressed to prepare for
more high-stake scenarios [[that demand rapid responses,
including]{.underline}]{.mark} those involving [[drones or hypersonic
missiles, as well as cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} effects. As NORTHCOM and
NORAD commander General Glen D. VanHerck has pointed out, [[capabilities
such as over-the-horizon]{.underline}]{.mark} radar
([OTHR]{.underline}), [[upgrades to the North Warning
System]{.underline}]{.mark}, improvements in integration of
[[information networks and]{.underline}]{.mark} fixes to vulnerabilities
of [[critical infrastructure, are all essential]{.underline}]{.mark}
steps [[to detect threats and enhance deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}
and defense. To help inform these upgrades, NORTHCOM should conduct a
classified assessment of Russian missile capabilities in Ukraine and its
implications for NORAD modernization.

3.3 Fostering Cohesion

In these modernization efforts, as well as others, [[it remains
important to foster constructive relations with local
communities]{.underline}]{.mark} -- an aim that needs to be prioritized
further. It is noteworthy that the US Coast Guard places a premium on
its seasonal interaction with local Alaskan communities. Similarly,
Canada has further increased its efforts to engage with local Canadian
communities, including through its Ranger concept. Beyond this,
additional avenues to create mutually beneficial results and
multipurpose investments that strengthen security should focus on
upgrading local infrastructure and telecommunications connectivity (an
activity which could be funded via the ASI). Relatedly, [[the United
States and its allies should]{.underline}]{.mark} focus on pathways to
[[increase **capacity**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region [[with
**sustainability** at the forefront of]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[planning. These efforts strengthen **social cohesion** and
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} and are [[reflective of the Nordic
countries' concept of comprehensive]{.underline}]{.mark} or "[[Total
Defense]{.underline}]{.mark}", [[which are successful examples for the
United States to emulate]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate, affecting global climate
systems, ecosystems, and local communities. These recommendations
provide a comprehensive strategy for addressing climate change in the
Arctic, incorporating risk assessment, monitoring, mitigation, community
participation, and policy formulation to promote resilience and
sustainability. [[Effective **risk assessment** is essential to tackle
Arctic climate challenges. Geospatial analysis can reveal **hotspots**
for permafrost degradation, glacier retreat, and carbon release, as well
as **vulnerabilities** in Arctic **biodiversity** and infrastructure.
Creating **multi-hazard vulnerability maps** that integrate
risks]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as ice melt, coastal erosion, and storm

Arctic observations are becoming increasingly valuable as researchers
investigate climate change and its associated concerns, such as
decreasing sea ice and increasing ship traffic. [[Networks of sensors
with frequent sampling capabilities are needed to run forecast models,
improve navigation, and inform climate research. Sampling frequency and
deployment duration are currently constrained by battery power
limitations. In-situ power generation using marine renewable energy
sources such as waves and currents can]{.underline}]{.mark} be used to
[[circumvent this constraint.]{.underline}]{.mark} Wave and current
resources vary spatially and temporally in the Arctic, with some
locations and seasons being better suited for marine renewable energy
power generation. Locations and seasons with small resources may still
be able to use marine renewable energy because of the low power
requirements of the instruments. In this study, we describe the wave and
current resources in the Arctic, outline the electricity generation
developments that are needed to utilize the resources, and suggest use
cases. [[Wave and current energy converters]{.underline}]{.mark}
developed [[to power observations in the Arctic could also be used to
power observations at lower latitudes. Marine renewable energy has the
potential to decrease dependence on batteries and improve data
collection capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic; however,
this would require the development of new low power technologies that
can operate [[in extreme Arctic environments]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Sensors used for Arctic marine observations
measure]{.underline}]{.mark} a wide variety of [[physical and biological
variables]{.underline}]{.mark} in the air, sea ice, and water. These
sensors may be deployed on top of sea ice, in sea ice, below sea ice,
and in ice-free waters. Moored buoy arrays measure physical parameters
[[such as water temperature, salinity, pH,
turbidity,]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[oxygen]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hauri
et al., 2018). Ice-tethered profilers measure a similar set of
parameters but drift with the sea ice (Krishfield et al., 2008). Moored
[hydrophones detect marine mammals]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} monitor the acoustic environment for changes
as the extent of the [[sea ice coverage]{.underline}]{.mark} decreases
(Stafford et al., 2018). Some Arctic observations are made as part of
short-term process studies, while others are made as part of long-term
monitoring programs (Rigor et al., 2008; Witte et al., 2021). All of
these [[observations have one common requirement]{.underline}]{.mark} -
the [[sensors and platforms]{.underline}]{.mark} collecting them [[must
survive the harsh Arctic environment]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Instrument deployments in the Arctic are challenging due to the
distance from major ports, cold temperatures, and]{.underline}]{.mark}
the complications of growing, melting, and moving [[sea
ice]{.underline}]{.mark}. Deployments are often centered around the date
of the minimum ice extent (Berge et al., 2016). [[Autonomous
platforms]{.underline}]{.mark} are preferred because they can [[increase
the spatial and temporal sampling]{.underline}]{.mark} above what is
possible with a ship or with personnel stationed on the ice (Lee et al.,
2017). Cold temperatures drain batteries quickly and reduce the number
of charge/discharge cycles (Williams et al., 2021). Extra batteries can
be added to increase the power available, but the [[measurement systems
are often weight limited]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and therefore limited in
the amount of batteries]{.underline}]{.mark} that can be attached to the
sensors. Reduced battery power means sampling rates and deployment
durations are power constrained (Krishfield et al., 2008). Many
oceanographic instruments such as temperature sensors, hydrophones,
tsunami detection buoys, and drifting profiling floats require \<10 W to
operate (Green et al., 2019). [[Powering oceanographic
instruments]{.underline}]{.mark} such as those mentioned above [[with
marine renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark} is an emerging market
(Copping et al., 2018; Cavagnaro et al., 2020). Co-located marine
renewable energy devices with continuous power generating capabilities
could recharge batteries, increase the sampling rate and deployment
time, and [[enable the use of instruments with higher power
requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In this study, we analyze the available marine renewable energy resource
in the Arctic, discuss the power requirements of commonly used
oceanographic instruments, and investigate how marine renewable energy
could be used to power Arctic observations in three representative use
cases. Marine renewable energy is considered here as energy that can be
produced by the movement of water. We evaluate the current state of the
art of marine renewable energy-based technologies and assess their
potential to meet the needs of the Arctic observing community.

Arctic marine renewable energy resources

[[The Arctic is]{.underline}]{.mark} referred to as [[the test bed for
renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark} utilization [[because alternative
energy sources are often necessary due to its remote location and lack
of grid power]{.underline}]{.mark}. Solar panels can be useful in summer
if the problem of frosting can be overcome; however, the solar resources
in winter are extremely limited. Wind power can be used, but it is an
intermittent resource and ice can accumulate on the turbine blades. To
operate in the Arctic, wind turbines have to be designed to work in
extreme weather conditions. [[Marine renewable energy may
be]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[useful]{.underline}]{.mark} resource [[in
the Arctic at select locations]{.underline}]{.mark} and certain times of
the year [[when solar]{.underline}]{.mark} panels [[and
wind]{.underline}]{.mark} turbines [[are not]{.underline}]{.mark} able
to perform optimally. For the purposes of this study, marine renewable
energy is defined as energy that is generated by water movement from
waves or currents. Above the Arctic circle, the wave and current
resources are relatively small compared to lower latitudes because tidal
velocities are low and sea ice dampens wave energy. [[The international
community has defined some areas]{.underline}]{.mark} below the Arctic
circle [[as the Arctic for scientific purposes]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Figure 1). Locations included in this broader definition [[include the
Bering Sea and Aleutian islands]{.underline}]{.mark}, which have
significant wave and tidal current resources [[that could be harvested
using marine renewable energy technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} (Haas et
al., 2011; García-Medina et al., 2021). Ice floe motion is also a
potential source of marine renewable energy as the ice is pushed by the
wind above or the current below. The ice floe motion resource varies
spatially and temporally like the wave and wind resources and will be
discussed in detail.

The investigation of potential use cases such as buoys on the ice, buoys
in the water, remote tide gauges, and hydrophones, revealed that some
applications may be more suited for marine renewable energy conversion
than others. The buoys deployed on the ice were only able to extract
energy from the current below the ice when the wind pushed the ice at a
speed above the turbine or VIV instrument's cut in speed. Buoys in the
water may be able to obtain power from a wave energy converter in the
Bering Sea but might struggle to find enough waves north of Alaska. The
remote tide gauges that are in need of supplemental power are located
too far from any current or wave energy resources to be a viable use
case for marine renewable energy without relocation. Hydrophones are
used in many locations around the Arctic and could potentially be
powered by a moored wave energy converter for those in locations with
sufficient wave resources. They could also potentially be powered using
turbines or VIV instruments when located in areas with significant tidal
velocities.

[[New energy conversion technologies need to be developed to power
Arctic observations with marine renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Wave energy converters and tidal turbines generating power in the range
of 1-10 W range required by most Arctic instruments are not currently
available. One small turbine is commercially available in that range but
it was not designed to power oceanographic observations. A VIV
instrument will be commercially available soon, but it has not yet been
tested to power oceanographic observations. [[Future developments should
integrate marine renewable energy technologies with Arctic observational
instruments such as wave energy converters in buoys and tidal turbine
powered hydrophones. Once these technologies have been developed to
withstand the harsh Arctic conditions they can also be used in the
Antarctic and at lower latitudes]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} is experiencing the dramatic effects
of climate change. It [[is warming twice as fast as lower
latitudes]{.underline}]{.mark} and these changes are
[[resulting]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} warmer
weather and [[a drastic reduction in sea ice
volumes]{.underline}]{.mark} (Blunden and Arndt, 2016). In 2021, the
post-winter sea ice volume was the lowest since records began and rain
was reported for the first time at the 3,200 m Summit Station in
Greenland (Moon et al., 2021). These changes have broader implications,
as [[conditions in the Arctic may have an effect on the weather at lower
latitudes]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, [[changes in the melting of
sea ice and spring snow may be responsible for
mid-latitude]{.underline}]{.mark} changes in [[extreme weather
events]{.underline}]{.mark} (Cohen et al., 2014). In-situ [[observations

Hydrophones

[[Hydrophones are used extensively]{.underline}]{.mark} in Alaska [[to
monitor vocalizing marine mammals]{.underline}]{.mark}. Figure 9 shows
the locations of past, current, and future hydrophone deployments (C.
Berchok, personal communication on January 19, 2022). The hydrophones
rarely collect data continuously, typically recording data on a
relatively sparse duty cycle (as low as 1.6 h of data collection per 24
h) (Clark et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2019). Power generation at the
hydrophone locations would increase the amount of data collected,
facilitating efforts to gain knowledge about the presence and behavior
of marine mammals inhabiting the region.

While most hydrophones currently deployed in the Arctic are not in ideal
locations for current energy conversion, two [[hydrophone
locations]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in the Aleutian Islands could
potentially be powered by tidal currents]{.underline}]{.mark}. Figure
10A shows the locations of the two hydrophones and the XTide reference
stations closest to them. The XTide reference stations are locations
where tidal predictions are made using the National Ocean Service
algorithm. Histograms of the XTide predicted current speeds and the
exceedance probability curves describe the current conditions that could
be used to generate electricity. At Unimak Pass, an XTide station close
to a hydrophone shows the current speed to be \>0.5 m/s for 46% of the
time (Figure 10B). This indicates that a turbine with a cut in speed of
0.5 m/s could contribute to powering a hydrophone or charging a battery
for 46% of the time, which amounts to 11 hours of the day. The Unimak
Pass [[hydrophone]{.underline}]{.mark} is especially important because
it [[monitors the critically endangered]{.underline}]{.mark} eastern
population of the [[North Pacific right whale]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Wright et al., 2018). The second hydrophone that is southwest of Unimak
Pass also monitors right whales, but does not have an XTide location
very close to it. The closest XTide location at Paso Point shows the
current distribution is narrow and the current speed is only above 0.5
m/s for 20% of the time (Figure 10C). This indicates a turbine would
only provide power to a hydrophone or battery during 5 hours of the day.
Further south in a narrow passage, the current speed at Konets Head is
above 0.5 m/s for 78% or the time and 50% of the time it is above 1.2
m/s (Figure 10D). This is an even stronger tidal resource than in Unimak
Pass. [[At this location]{.underline}]{.mark} energy would be supplied
to a hydrophone or battery for 19 hours of the day. If the hydrophone
were moved to inside the narrow passage, [[there would be plenty of
tidal energy]{.underline}]{.mark} to be harvested to operate it.
However, we note that deployment of a hydrophone in a tidal channel
presents other challenges, including increased flow noise that may
impact low-frequency measurements (Bassett et al., 2014).

Introduction **[The Arctic is very sensitive to climate change1, and the
Arctic sea ice retreat continually accelerates because of global
warming ]{.underline}**2. Specifically, the sea ice extent (SIE), sea
ice thickness (SIT), and sea ice concentration (SIC) will be more
sensitive to climate forcing and decrease sharply in summer and
autumn3,4,5. Thus, **[[an ice-free Arctic in September is foreseeable
under all scenarios considered6 but with much uncertainty in the
timing]{.mark}7. [This makes possible the opening of Arctic passages. It
is widely believed that the retreat of sea ice enhances the feasibility
of Arctic maritime transport. The Arctic passages, compared with
traditional shipping routes (such as the Suez Canal), could reduce
maritime transport distance by 40% and transport time by 30% between
Europe and northwestern Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}**[8]{.mark},9. It thus
could not only reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions from
international maritime transport10,11 but also enhance the efficiency of
the global transportation network12. Given that trade volume between
Europe and northwestern Asia occupies a large share of global trade, the
opening of the Arctic passages would clearly change the international
division of labor and industrial distribution13 and affect global trade
patterns14. **[There are some studies on the feasibility and
navigability of maritime transport in the Arctic region.]{.underline}**
Most of the existing studies focus on the effects of the navigation
environment on maritime transport. For example, some studies have
examined the impacts of weather conditions15,16. Other studies, e.g.,
the Polar Operational Limit Assessment Risk Indexing System (POLARIS)17
and the Canadian Arctic Ice Regime Shipping System (AIRSS)18, focus on
the influence of SIT and SIC. These studies have found that
meteorological and hydrological risks, such as strong wind, low
visibility, low temperature, and shallow water, are also major obstacles
to ship navigability19,20,21,22,23. Water depth is the key constraint to
the Arctic shipping 24. Other studies have concluded that sea surface
temperature and sea ice motion (SIM) are key factors in the feasibility
of maritime transport in the Arctic region25,26,27. SIM and sea ice
drift may change the heading of ships for interaction with the hull,
especially for large carrier ships28. **[In recent years, [predicting
the overall impacts of climate change on Arctic maritime transport has
been attracting researchers' interest in the
field]{.mark}]{.underline}**[29]{.mark},30,31. These researchers try to
build links between long-term climate change, the changes in sea ice
conditions in the Arctic, and the navigability and optimal shipping
routes of maritime transport across the Arctic region, mostly using
non-strengthened open water (OW) ships and medium-strengthened Polar
Class (PC) 6 ships as ship samples32,33,34 without due consideration for
the choice of PC6 and its practical impact on transportation and
logistics. Undeniably, two research gaps still need to be filled in the
field. One is that, when navigability is assessed, only SIT and SIC have
been considered. The other is that the most widely used,
thin-strengthened PC735 ships have seldom been evaluated. This paper
aims to fill these gaps by analyzing the temporal and spatial changes of
sea ice and the navigability of maritime transport in the Arctic
passages during the period 2023--2100. First, we compared the observed
data with the simulated Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6
(CMIP6) data to reduce the uncertainty of projected data. Second, we
examined PC 7 and OW ships, which are (respectively) predominantly and
potentially used in the region. Finally, we performed temporal and
spatial analysis of navigable days (ND), navigable period (NP),
navigable area, and optimal navigable routes distribution with
consideration of SIC, SIT, and sea ice dynamic factors.

[[By providing reliable and secure communication, the two-satellite ASBM
constellation]{.underline}]{.mark} --- hosted on Northrop Grumman's
GEOStar-3 satellite bus --- [[will deliver broad benefits to the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Jeremy Novosad, program
director, ASBM, Northrop Grumman. Two of ASBM's Northrop Grumman-built
payloads for the Norwegian Armed Forces and Viasat expand connectivity
[[for everything from air travel to shipping]{.underline}]{.mark} and
fishing to Allied operations, including search and rescue missions.

"[[Connectivity is the backbone of this unique
mission]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Jeremy. "It's a very critical
capability that we are delivering."

Alongside Space Norway's commercial payloads is the U.S. Space Force's
Enhanced Polar Systems-Recapitalization (EPS-R) payload. Also built by
Northrop Grumman, EPS-R will deliver protected, anti-jam military
satellite communications coverage to U.S. forces operating in the
Northern polar region and will be enabled by the Control and Planning
Segment (CAPS), Northrop Grumman's next-generation ground system.

"The U.S. military has to have a presence in the Arctic region. While
they're up there, they have to make sure there's good communications
back to the domestic command-and-control authority," said Steve Dunlop,
program manager, EPS-R CAPS Ground System, Northrop Grumman. "EPS-R
delivers faster, secure communications for U.S. forces, giving more
capabilities for the warfighter. That's the advantage."

The inclusion of EPS-R in ASBM represents a historic moment for hybrid
space missions: the first time an operational U.S. military payload is
hosted on an internationally operated, commercial satellite.

The EPS-R payload was isolated from the rest of the satellite, enabling
the payload to catch a ride on ASBM while meeting security requirements,
said Rohit Raja, who served as program director, EPS-R, Northrop
Grumman. The result is a trailblazing achievement that paves the way for
future hybrid military-commercial launches.

An Eye to the Future

In coming years, the [[broadband connectivity delivered by ASBM will
provide additional capabilities to commercial]{.underline}]{.mark} and
military [[crafts to navigate the High North]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
similar to how a cell tower provides connectivity to nearby devices,
said Inger Melby, capture director, Northrop Grumman. Inger grew up in
Norway and now works on Northrop Grumman's multi-intelligence MQ-4C
Triton.

"Triton was designed to use wide-band satellites and is immediately
capable of utilizing Norway's investment in ASBM," said Inger. "ASBM
will provide the satellite coverage that could further support a Triton
operating in the High North."

The most advanced maritime intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance
and targeting capability deployed today, [[Triton does not currently
operate in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} but is under consideration
for exactly that mission. The adoption of Triton in the region would
bring unprecedented Northern polar maritime surveillance, according to
Inger, delivering 24-hour coverage for the communications and command
and control needed to keep a constant eye on the Arctic maritime domain.

Bringing the region online with ASBM is the first step in writing the
Arctic's next chapter. Underpinned by assured connectivity, the
possibilities in the region are bright.

[[As the Arctic continues to be fundamentally reshaped, the United
States and its allies in the region will need to quickly adapt by
strengthening their collective]{.underline}]{.mark} security and
expanding their [[Arctic awareness. Arctic-ready unmanned aircraft
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} (UAS) [[can help them adjust to the
changing landscape.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The transformation of the Arctic---one of the world's harshest
environments---is being fueled by two significant factors: climate
change and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. First, [[climate
change is heating the Arctic, causing ice to rapidly
recede]{.underline}]{.mark}: Some estimates say that the Arctic could be
ice-free (during the summer) as soon as 2035. [[That is making natural
resources and shipping lanes more accessible. The Arctic holds nearly 30
percent of the world's undiscovered natural gas]{.underline}]{.mark}; it
also hosts growing fisheries that commercial (as well as illegal)
operations will aim to exploit. Additionally, [[the Arctic region has
the potential to connect roughly 75 percent of the world's population,
making quicker Arctic routes extremely valuable for commercial and
illicit traffic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Second, Russia's invasion of Ukraine (taking place over 1,700 kilometers
from the Arctic Circle) has largely ended cooperation between Moscow and
the countries known as the Arctic 7---Canada, Iceland, Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, Finland, and the United States---as Russia further militarizes
and disputes Arctic territory and resource ownership.

Together, these two factors are contributing to increases in commercial
traffic, illegal shipping and fishing operations, competition over
natural resources, and militarization.

Russia controls 53 percent of the Arctic Ocean coastline and has made
massive investments in building and modernizing its Arctic bases,
fleets, and weapons systems over the past two decades. During this time,
Russia has been building up a fleet of nuclear-capable icebreakers,
ships, and submarines; established more mining and drilling operations;
and made moves that suggest it aims to control Arctic Sea routes
normally accessible to all. Russia has also militarized its fishing
vessels, icebreakers, and other commercial vessels and has taken
increasingly aggressive actions in the Arctic as it disputes
jurisdiction over territorial waters and seabeds.

When it comes to investing in Arctic security, the Arctic 7
countries---all of which are NATO allies except for pending member
Sweden---are largely playing catch-up in their efforts to counter
Russia's investments. However, over the past year, US and NATO leaders
have woken up to the evolving environment and have reinvigorated their
focus on Arctic security. If the United States and its Arctic allies
hope to quickly improve security in this vast region, they will need to
expand Arctic awareness in a way that is efficient, is cost effective,
and reduces risk to personnel and critical assets.

New modernized Arctic bases and fleets could expand Arctic awareness,
but they're a tall order, even in the long term. The Arctic is a very
harsh environment for ground forces, and expensive naval vessels and
manned aircraft cannot safely and efficiently cover the region without
backup. For example, manned aircraft traditionally need a secondary
rescue capacity in case they go down. This requires costly resources in
terms of additional training, personnel, basing, and aircraft.

However, [[cost-effective, Arctic-ready unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)
may help the allies fill]{.underline}]{.mark} their security [[gaps
today]{.underline}]{.mark}. If a UAS goes down, there is no need for a
rapid rescue mission because the remote pilot and crew are safely on the
ground in another location. As a cost-effective complement to manned
assets, UAS also can remotely fly longer missions using satellite
communications, connect joint forces, and maintain a shared real-time
intelligence picture of the Arctic, reducing the overall cost of
expanded operations and eliminating risks to human pilots or crew.
Leveraging UAS would enable Arctic allies to quickly expand coverage in
the region from anywhere in the world. (Disclosure: I work for General
Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which manufactures one of several such UAS
models.)

Monitoring increased commercial and illegal activity

With climate change's dramatic effects on the Arctic, and the resulting
increased maritime traffic and geopolitical competition for commercial
control, NATO will need continuous airborne situational awareness and
communications within the Alliance and with Arctic partners. [[New
Arctic-ready UAS are ideal assets for conducting such civil operations
in the Arctic. With the ability to withstand extremely low temperatures
and the ability to fly long missions via satellite, Arctic-ready UAS are
well suited for continuously monitoring shipping
lanes]{.underline}]{.mark}, fisheries, and environmental disasters, and
for conducting search and rescue operations. [[More UAS over the Arctic
could enhance cooperation, help ensure the safety of peaceful commercial
activity, and improve climate security]{.underline}]{.mark}.

For example, if a ship is in distress and a UAS is on mission, the
aircraft can easily be tasked to provide video, radar, and
communications relay in support of first responders; the UAS could
potentially deploy life-saving emergency supplies directly. Similarly,
if there are reports of illicit fishing operations and a suspected
vessel turns off its transponder identification, UAS can help
authorities to locate, identify, and apprehend the vessel, removing the
guesswork and initial risks to human patrols.

Arctic-ready UAS can also be valuable research tools for monitoring
wildlife, icemelt, and more to help scientists understand the
environmental and community impacts of climate change, despite
complications brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Before, Russia
and the Arctic 7 were largely able to collaborate on important
environmental research and socio-economic development activities in the
region through the Arctic Council. But due to Russia's invasion, the
Arctic 7 countries have largely isolated Moscow from ongoing activities
at a cost of resources and regional access. [[The use of UAS could help
fill gaps by supporting important airborne research on the impacts of
climate change on Arctic ecosystems and
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Operating without sufficient communications tools is "arguably more
dangerous in the Arctic than in many other places, given the vast
distances, risky operating conditions, small population and very limited
infrastructure,"]{.underline}]{.mark} according to a 2018 Homeland
Security Operational Analysis Center report titled, "Identifying
Potential Gaps in U.S. Coast Guard Arctic Capabilities." The center is
operated by the RAND Corp. under a contract with the Department of
Homeland Security.

[[Operators in the Arctic currently rely on voice communications via
existing radios and some satellite capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark},
including the Iridium Communications constellation, which operates in
low-Earth orbit and provides global voice and data satellite coverage.
The Navy's mobile user objective system communications satellites can
also assist with coverage in the Arctic, but they are not yet available
to the Coast Guard, according to the report. [[Cell phone communications
are extremely limited, and data transmission is even more
challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Communications capabilities in the Arctic were described as "woefully
inadequate" by sources cited in the report, which offered several
possible avenues for remediation, including installing additional
infrastructure and leveraging the growing number of commercial
communications satellites in polar orbits.

Communications and weather are major capability gaps for Arctic
operators, said Charity Weeden, president of Lquinox Consulting, a
Silver Spring, Maryland-based space and data management consulting firm.

Weeden previously served as a navigator for the Royal Canadian Air Force
and performed Arctic patrols and open ocean surveillance in a CP-140
anti-submarine and maritime surveillance aircraft, the Canadian variant
of a P-3 Orion. She also worked on U.S.-Canada military space
cooperation.

Before satellite phones were installed on patrol aircraft, getting a
signal to connect with command and control was a perennial struggle in
her navigator role, she noted.

"Whenever we performed Arctic patrols, we had to give an update of our
position to make sure we call back and say, ... 'We're all good, we're
on task,'" she said. The ionosphere frequently affects high-frequency
radio waves and disrupts communications, she added.

"When I would go out to send my position report, I would just get
static. And so I would spend the bulk of that time ... trying to hail
the operations center to tell them where we are and that we're safe,"
Weeden said. "The day I flew and the satellite phone was installed ... I
conducted my call and they heard me loud and clear. And that was a
relief."

[[Communications in the Arctic could still be
improved]{.underline}]{.mark}, she noted. [[More wideband
coverage]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular [[could help unmanned
systems or support search-and-rescue missions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The Coast Guard currently uses **some** satellites, sensors and
various fixed assets for domain awareness, navigation and weather
information, the operational analysis center report
noted]{.underline}]{.mark}. They include: the International
Cospas-Sarsat system, a satellite to facilitate search-and-rescue
missions; personal locator beacons; various sources of satellite imagery
and products; automatic identification systems on ships; land-based
receiving stations operated by the Marine Exchange of Alaska; and the

Trump's interest in Greenland is often associated with the island's
vast, but largely untapped, mineral resources. But its strategic
location is arguably an even greater asset. [[Shipping routes through
the Arctic have become more dependable and for longer periods of time
during the year as a result of melting sea ice.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
northwest passage (along the US and Canadian shorelines) and the
northeast passage (along Russia's Arctic coast) are often ice free now
during the summer.

[[This has increased opportunities for commercial
shipping]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, the distance for a container
ship from Asia to Europe through the northeast passage can be up to
three times shorter, compared to traditional routes through the Suez
Canal or around Africa.

Similarly, the northwest passage offers the shortest route between the
east coast of the United States and Alaska. [[Add to that the likely
substantial resources that the Arctic has, from oil and gas to minerals,
and the entire region is beginning to look like a giant real estate deal
in the making]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Arctic assets

[[The economic promise of the Arctic, and particularly the region's
greater accessibility, have also heightened]{.underline}]{.mark}
military and security [[sensitivities]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The day before J.D. Vance's visit to Greenland on March 28, Vladimir
Putin, gave a speech at the sixth international Arctic forum in Murmansk
in Russia's high north, warning of increased geopolitical rivalry.

While he claimed that "Russia has never threatened anyone in the
Arctic", he was also quick to emphasise that Moscow was "enhancing the
combat capabilities of the Armed Forces, and modernising military
infrastructure facilities" in the Arctic.

Equally worrying, Russia has increased its naval cooperation with China
and given Beijing access, and a stake, in the Arctic. In April 2024, the
two countries' navies signed a cooperation agreement on search and
rescue missions on the high seas.

In September 2024, China participated in Russia's largest naval
manoeuvres in the post-cold war era, Ocean-2024, which were conducted in
north Pacific and Arctic waters. The following month, Russian and
Chinese coastguard vessels conducted their first joint patrol in the
Arctic. Vance, therefore, has a point when he urges Greenland and
Denmark to cut a deal with the US because the "island isn't safe".

of its Arctic territories]{.underline}]{.mark}, Canada has just

### 2AC - Shipping -- Accesses Environment

#### Arctic shipping routes reduce carbon footprint of shipping and solve their environmental concerns.

international shipping routes, study finds," Accessed 7/4/25,

PROVIDENCE, R.I. \[Brown University\] --- **[With climate change rapidly
warming the world's oceans, the future of the Arctic Ocean looks grim.
Climate models show that parts of the Arctic that were once covered in
ice year-round are warming so quickly that they will be reliably
ice-free for months on end in as few as two decades.]{.underline}** The
Arctic's changing climate will endanger countless species that thrive in
sub-zero temperatures, scientists say. **[[Another critical consequence
of melting ice in the Arctic? The potential for shorter, more
eco-friendly maritime trade routes that bypass the Russian-controlled
Northern Sea Route.]{.mark} In a new study, a pair of [climate
scientists at Brown University]{.mark} worked with a legal scholar at
the University of Maine School of Law to predict how Arctic Ocean ice
melt could affect the regulation of shipping routes over the next few
decades. They [projected that by 2065, the Arctic's navigability will
increase]{.mark} so greatly that it could yield new trade routes in
international waters --- [not only reducing the shipping industry's
carbon footprint but also weakening Russia's control over trade in the
Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The study was published on Monday, June
20, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "There's no
scenario in which melting ice in the Arctic is good news," said Amanda
Lynch, the study's lead author and a professor of Earth, environmental
and planetary sciences at Brown. "**[But the unfortunate reality is that
the ice is already retreating, these routes are opening up, and we need
to start thinking critically about the legal, environmental and
geopolitical implications."]{.underline}** Lynch, who has studied
climate change in the Arctic for nearly 30 years, said that as a first
step, she worked with Xueke Li, a postdoctoral research associate at the
Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, to model four navigation
scenarios based on four likely outcomes of global actions to halt
climate change in the coming years. Their projections showed that unless
global leaders successfully constrain warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius
over the next 43 years, climate change will likely open up several new
routes through international waters by the middle of this century.
**[[One critical consequence of melting ice in the Arctic: the potential
for shorter, more eco-friendly maritime trade routes that bypass the
Russian-controlled Northern Sea Route, shown here in
green]{.mark}.]{.underline}** According to Charles Norchi --- director
of the Center for Oceans and Coastal Law at Maine Law, a visiting
scholar at Brown's Watson Institute for International and Public
Affairs, and one of the study's co-authors --- **[those changes could
have major implications for world trade and global
politics.]{.underline}** Norchi explained that since 1982, the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has given Arctic coastal states
enhanced authority over primary shipping routes. Article 234 of the
convention states that in the name of "the prevention, reduction and
control of marine pollution from vessels," countries whose coastlines
are near Arctic shipping routes have the ability to regulate the route's
maritime traffic, so long as the area remains ice-covered for the
majority of the year. Norchi said that for decades, Russia has used
Article 234 for its own economic and geopolitical interests. One Russian
law requires all vessels passing through the Northern Sea Route to be
piloted by Russians. The country also requires that passing vessels pay
tolls and provide advance notice of their plans to use the route. The
heavy regulation is one among many reasons why major shipping companies
often bypass the route's heavy regulations and high costs and instead
use the Suez and Panama canals --- longer, but cheaper and easier, trade
routes. **[But as the ice near Russia's northern coast begins to melt,
Norchi said, so will the country's grip on shipping through the Arctic
Ocean.]{.underline}** "The Russians will, I\'m sure, continue to invoke
Article 234, which they will attempt to back up with their might,"
Norchi said. "But they will be challenged by the international
community, because Article 234 will cease to be applicable if there\'s
no ice covered-area for most of the year. Not only that, but with
melting ice, shipping will move out of Russian territorial waters and
into international waters. If that happens, **[[Russia can't do much,
because the outcome is driven by climate change and shipping
economics."]{.underline}]{.mark}** According to Lynch, previous studies
have shown that Arctic routes are 30% to 50% shorter than the Suez Canal
and Panama Canal routes, with transit time reduced by an estimated 14 to
20 days. That means that **[if international Arctic waters warm enough
to open up new pathways, [shipping companies could reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions by about 24% while also saving money and time.
]{.mark}]{.underline}**"These potential new Arctic routes are a useful
thing to consider when you recall the moment when the Ever Given ship
was stranded in the Suez Canal, blocking an important shipping route for
several weeks," Lynch said. "Diversifying trade routes --- especially
considering new routes that can't be blocked, because they're not canals
--- gives the global shipping infrastructure a lot more resiliency." And
it's better to ask questions about the future of shipping now, Lynch
said, rather than later, given how long it can take to establish
international laws. (For context, she said, it took 10 years for world
governments to negotiate the Convention on the Law of the Sea.) Lynch
hopes that kicking off the conversation on the **[Arctic's trade future
with well-researched scholarship might help world leaders make informed
decisions about protecting the Earth's climate from future
harm.]{.underline}** "Flagging these coming changes now could help
prevent them from emerging as a crisis that has to be resolved rapidly,
which almost never turns out well," Lynch said. "To actually craft
international agreements with some forethought and deliberation is
certainly a better way to go."

[The **missile [attacks]{.mark}** [in the **Red Sea** provide a]{.mark}
stark [reminder of the vulnerability of]{.mark} commercial
[shipping]{.mark}]{.underline}. While prior threats, such as those from
pirates off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Guinea could be
warded off by armed guards riding shotgun, [the more sophisticated
threat from **Iran-backed Houthi** terrorists has called for the
deployment of **serious naval assets**]{.underline}. These developments
provide insights into how the logic of commercial interests is being
trumped by geopolitical tensions.

The supply lines and choke points

The opening of the Suez Canal was a historic event that transformed
global logistics. Ever since its completion in 1869, it has been the
favored route for shipping from Europe to Asia, allowing ships to avoid
the lengthy detour around the continent of Africa. The downside is that
these savings do not come without risks.

The broader lesson of the recent Red Sea events is that [[the **global**
flow of goods can be **held hostage** via **critical choke
points**]{.mark} that determined actors may interdict]{.underline}. The
Suez Crisis in 1956 provided an early illustration that threats to the
ownership of critical real estate can provoke war. When Egyptian
president Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal Company, which
had been controlled by French and British interests, France, Britain and
Israel responded with military intervention.

The canal zone itself is not the only vulnerability on this vital route.
To the south, the narrow Strait of Bab el-Mandeb separates Africa from
the Arabian Peninsula. That is where Somali pirates emerged as a key
player and where Houthi terrorists operating out of Yemen began
threatening shipping by laying sea mines.

[[A choke point of]{.mark} similar [importance is the **Strait of
Hormuz**]{.mark}, which offers [the **only** passage for tankers out of
the Persian Gulf]{.mark}. As tensions between Iran and the West have
escalated, [it has become a]{.mark} significant global [flash point. By
moving to **block** it, Iran]{.mark} (or its proxies) [could cause a
**global energy crisis** that could then translate into]{.mark} a
**kinetic [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Further to the east, China has long been aware of its own vulnerability,
as the United States Navy may interdict its energy supply from the
Persian Gulf at the Strait of Malacca. A total blockage could stop 80
percent of the Middle Kingdom's crude oil imports. As in the case of a
Strait of Hormuz blockage, it would inevitably produce a flashing red
alert.

[[Even short of such outcomes, the]{.mark} mounting [risks]{.mark} of
prolonged **disturbances** at various choke points [**hurt shipping** by
increasing **uncertainty and insurance costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Enter the northern route

[[The combined impact]{.mark} of all these developments has been to
[shed]{.mark} new [light on the **Northern Sea Route**]{.mark}
**(NSR)**, which links Europe with Asia via the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}.

While the distance from Rotterdam to Yokohama via the Suez Canal Route
is about 21,500 kilometers, it shrinks to only 11,900 kilometers via the
Northern Sea. [The **[time of passage]{.mark}** -- a **critical** factor
in determining the **efficiency** of shipping routes -- [is]{.mark} in
this case [**reduced** by close to **half**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Taking the Northern Sea Route was long practically **impossible** due
to the thick **sea ice** laced with impenetrable ridges. However, as
climate change has caused the Arctic ice cover to recede, [**new
opportunities** have surfaced]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If it were a purely commercial decision, a massive wager on this route
would have been a foregone conclusion. The commercial argument received
an added boost in March 2021, when a stranded container ship blocked the
Suez Canal for six days, holding up to 400 vessels in place and causing
massive economic losses. To Western countries, however, the northern
seaway is far from a purely commercial matter.

**Arctic NSR allows the avoidance of the Red Sea.**

[Suez Canal route, and around half of the distance needed to divert
around the Cape of Good Hope. The shorter distance would likely give
shipping lines the opportunity to compete with faster transport
modes]{.mark}.]{.underline}** However, this does not mean trouble-free
Arctic navigation for most container vessels. To be used in the region,
vessels will need ice-strengthened hulls, because even using the channel
behind an icebreaker requires vessel hulls to be able to fend off small
floating 'growlers' and 'bergy-bits'. Also, European container lines
will have to decide on their appetite for political sensitivity
surrounding the NSR. The route relies on Russian search-and-rescue (SAR)
capability for vessel transits, and the route is expected to benefit
from \$7.7bn in investment by the Russian government. **["[Whether this
is good or bad, it is happening -- the Northern Sea Route is opening
up,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}said Russian premier Vladimir Putin
early last year. The Trans-Siberian Railway, which uses Russia-installed
tracks to carry Chinese trains to Europe, is one route where expedience
has won out over politics. But it remains to be seen whether this can be
replicated in the shipping industry. Meanwhile, while climate activists
will not be reassured to see vessels plying sensitive Arctic waters, the
fuel left unburned and the associated CO2 emissions from shorter
transits could play a pivotal role in decarbonising cargo.

A boon to Russia's energy business

At the time of the 2022 invasion, Russia exported about 400,000 barrels
of crude oil per day to Northern Europe. By the end of that year, that
flow had dried up while exports to Asia reached 300,000 barrels per day.
During 2023, as crude oil shipments from the Baltic Sea to China were
rerouted from the Suez Canal Route, the Northern Sea Route recorded a
new record volume of transit cargo. Out of a total volume of 2.1 million
metric tons that made the full transit across the frigid northern
waters, 1.5 million metric tons was crude oil from the Baltic Sea.

The main lesson from this boost in traffic concerns the changing nature
of the cargo flows. [The Russian development plan envisioned that the
**bulk** of the cargo would be hydrocarbons]{.underline}. As non-Russian
shipping companies walked away, that pattern became dominant. [In
[2023]{.mark}, the total [volume of]{.mark} freight set a record of
**[36 million metric tons]{.mark}**, more than [**half** of which was
**liquefied natural gas**]{.mark} **(LNG)**]{.underline} shipped both to
Europe and to Asia. The latter explains the difference between the
respective volumes of transit cargo and total cargo.

The core part of the Northern Sea Route stretches along the Russian
Arctic seaboard from Murmansk to the Bering Strait. Transit traffic is
cargo between Europe and Asia that passes both ends of this stretch.
That is now only a small part of the total. [The bulk is traffic that
emanates in Russia and is taken to either Europe or China. [Although
**crude oil**]{.mark} from Arctic fields [does play a part, the
**primary source** of]{.mark} this [trade is **LNG**]{.mark} produced on
the Yamal Peninsula by the Russian private energy company
Novatek.]{.underline}

When Russia's national gas giant Gazprom placed a losing bet on
pipelines, Novatek invested in developing LNG and scored. China played
an important supportive role already before the imposition of sanctions,
assuming ownership stakes in Novatek projects. As the West sanctioned
Russia's energy interests, China has continued providing vital inputs
for those projects. As late as April 2024, delivery of a 14th
prefabricated plant module allowed Novatek to complete the construction
of a second production unit for its Arctic LNG plant located on the
Gydan Peninsula in Western Siberia, Russia. The project aims to export
gas from Novatek's Salmanovskoye and Geofizicheskoye fields, with a
planned yearly capacity of 19.8 million tons across three production
lines.

[Much of this LNG goes to Europe, which has stopped short of sanctioning
Russian gas. Until recently, [some volumes]{.mark} were even [exported
to Europe for transshipment to other destinations, creating an expanding
market for Russia, which has]{.mark} now [become the **fourth-largest
exporter of LNG**]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}. The associated
rapid expansion of shipping under sanctions has a severe downside.

2\. Environmental Considerations and Carbon Reduction Goals

The global imperative to address climate change has propelled the
[exploration of cleaner energy alternatives, and in this landscape,
Liquefied Natural Gas (**[LNG]{.mark}**) emerges as [a **bridge
fuel**]{.mark}, strategically [positioned to navigate]{.mark} the
**[complexities of the transition to renewable
energy]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Diabat, and Al-Salem, 2015; Honegger, et
al., 2021). This section delves into the environmental considerations
and carbon reduction goals that underscore LNG\'s significance in the
global pursuit of a greener future (Wang, 2023; Mahapatra, et al.,
2021).

[LNG, in its liquefied form, offers [a **cleaner alternative**]{.mark}
to traditional fossil fuels, particularly coal and oil. When combusted,
natural gas produces **[fewer]{.mark} greenhouse gas
[emissions]{.mark}**, notably lower levels of carbon dioxide
(CO2)]{.underline} and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides (Chaabane et al., 2011). This cleaner combustion profile aligns
with the escalating global awareness of the need to reduce air pollution
and mitigate the impacts of climate change. [[As the world
**transitions**]{.mark} away from more carbon-intensive energy sources,
the cleaner nature of [LNG]{.mark} positions it as [a **crucial
intermediary** in meeting **energy demands**]{.mark} while concurrently
reducing the environmental footprint]{.underline} (Honegger, et al.,
2021; Wang, et al., 2023). Governments and international bodies have set
ambitious carbon reduction goals as part of broader initiatives to
combat climate change (Mahapatra et al., 2021). [LNG, as a **[bridge
fuel]{.mark}**, [plays a **pivotal** role in achieving]{.mark} these
[targets]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Its cleaner combustion contributes to
[**immediate reductions** in]{.mark} carbon
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} compared to traditional fossil fuels,
aligning with the carbon reduction aspirations outlined in international
agreements such as the **[Paris Agreement]{.underline}**. [LNG\'s role
extends beyond its immediate environmental impact; [it serves as a
**catalyst** in fostering the development and integration of **renewable
energy**]{.mark} sources by providing a reliable and lower-emission
alternative during the **transitional phase**]{.underline} (Stern, 2022;
Ahmed, et al., 2023; Prontera, 2017).

[One of the inherent challenges of renewable energy sources, such as
**solar and wind**, is their intermittency. LNG addresses this challenge
by offering a reliable and flexible energy source that can **complement
intermittent renewables**]{.underline}. LNG-fired power plants can
quickly respond to fluctuations in renewable energy generation,
providing a stable and continuous energy supply. [This [capacity to act
as a **dependable backup mitigates the intermittency challenges**
associated with renewables]{.mark}, ensuring a **steady energy flow**
and [enhancing the]{.mark} overall [**reliability** of the energy
grid]{.mark}]{.underline}. In essence, the examination of LNG as a
cleaner alternative, its contribution to achieving carbon reduction
goals, and its role in addressing the challenges of intermittent
renewables collectively [position [LNG]{.mark} as a **[vital]{.mark}
player** [in the **global energy transition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
we progress towards a sustainable future, understanding these
environmental considerations becomes imperative, guiding policymakers
and industry stakeholders in making informed decisions that balance
immediate energy needs with long-term environmental objectives.

Financial Times, London (Dec 5, 2023). "Houthi attacks on vessels in Red
Sea sound alarm for global trade," Accessed via ProQuest, VY\]

**[[Shipowners have called for more military protection on maritime
routes in the Middle East after attacks by Iran-backed rebels in the Red
Sea sparked fears of new disruptions to global trade, including of
energy supplies. On Sunday, the Pentagon said a US warship and three
commercial vessels had come under attack off the Yemeni coast, prompting
concerns that Houthi rebels]{.mark} --- who targeted Israeli ships last
month --- and their backers [in Iran were widening their campaign in
response to war in Gaza.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Jakob Larsen, head of
security at Bimco, which represents global shipowners, said the attacks
showed that "more military resources" needed to be deployed. "When you
see three ships attacked \[on the same day\] in the same geographic area
that implies we are a bit short of resources," Larsen said. On Monday,
US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the attacks were
"totally unacceptable", adding that the US was in talks with other
countries about setting up a maritime task force to ensure "safe passage
of ships in the Red Sea". The new threat to shipping --- which could
affect trade in everything from crude oil to motor vehicles --- comes
not long after supply chains were upended by the Covid pandemic and
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fanning inflation and cooling the global
economy. Analysts said traders were now underestimating the threat of
further disruption. **["The oil market has become too complacent about
risks that the Gaza conflict will expand regionally and threaten oil and
gas infrastructure and shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf,]{.underline}**"
said Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Energy and a former adviser to the
George W Bush White House. **[Since 2019 Houthis and other suspected
Iranian proxies have struck at multiple vessels in the Middle East,
seizing oil tankers and mounting clandestine attacks using limpet mines
attached to hulls. [The latest attacks also add to concerns about the
threat posed by Tehran to the Strait of Hormuz]{.mark} --- the narrow
waterway separating Iran from the Gulf states that is a chokepoint for
oil and gas exports.]{.underline}** McNally put the odds of a "material
interruption in regional energy flows" as high as 30 per cent. **["While
neither [Tehran nor Washington may desire a direct conflict, they also
may not be able to avoid unintended clashes or arrest upwardly
spiralling tit-for-tat attacks."]{.mark}]{.underline}** About 40 per
cent of seaborne oil trade passes through the Strait of Hormuz daily,
alongside liquefied natural gas shipments from Qatar, which have helped
Europe to replace Russian gas. The Red Sea route itself carries almost a
tenth of seaborne-traded oil supplies, according to the US Energy
Information Administration, and is also a conduit for goods from Asia.
The Bab el-Mandeb Strait, separating the Gulf of Aden from the Red Sea,
is even narrower --- and more vulnerable to attack --- than the Strait
of Hormuz. **[["The Red Sea route matters,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** said
Henning Gloystein at consultancy Eurasia Group. **["It matters even more
for the Europeans who get all their Middle Eastern oil and LNG through
the Red Sea."]{.underline}** In an attack on an Israeli-owned car
carrier in November, Houthi rebels boarded the ship by helicopter --- a
tactic "much more commonly employed by Iran", according to Gabrielle
Reid at security consultancy S-RM. "It points to a greater ability to
disrupt merchant shipping in the region," she added. Shipowners are now
exploring safer, but costlier[, **[alternative routes and calling for
more protection in Middle Eastern waters.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Zim,
the New-York listed Israeli cargo shipping company, said last week that
it was rerouting some of its vessels and warned customers of longer
transit times. The alternative route involves rounding the Cape of Good
Hope, near Cape Town, and sailing along western Africa, a far lengthier
and costlier route. Shipowners are already having to pay more for
insurance, as well as diverting vessels and investing in additional
security measures. Marcus Baker, head of marine at insurance broker
Marsh, said some insurers had already increased rates during the week
before Sunday's Red Sea attacks, in one case by as much as 300 per cent.
He added that the market "is going to have to react" to the latest
incidents. However, shipowners had little choice but to stick with the
existing route, he said. "If you're trying to get \[certain\] goods
around the world, you have almost got to go through" the Red Sea region.
Dimitris Maniatis, chief operating officer at Seagull Maritime, said the
security group was receiving "more and more" requests for armed guards
from shipowners around the world. But private security groups, many of
which were formed to counter the threat from Somali pirates, could do
"very little" against state-backed drone and missile attacks, he said.
**[["The risk of collateral damage has
increased]{.mark},"]{.underline}** said the security chief of a
Singapore-based tanker owner, adding that at least one of the commercial
vessels reportedly attacked on Sunday did not have clear links to
Israel. **["[Against external attacks, we are like sitting ducks. No one
is capable of countering such a threat unless it is military
intervention."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Ever since Iranian-backed Houthis began attacking ships in the Red
Sea in November, there\'s been the risk that oil supplies could be
disrupted if the situation were to escalate- and in many ways, escalate
it has.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The Yemen-based movement continues to
attack commercial ships, which has extended shipping times for companies
choosing to go around the Horn of Africa instead, and has also increased
shipping costs. Then, in late January, a drone attack in Jordan killed
three U.S. service personnel and injured more than 30. That was the
first time U.S. troops were killed by enemy fire in the Middle East
since the beginning of the war in Gaza. Yet, contrary to what one might
expect, crude prices have actually showed a lackluster performance. In
fact, as of early February, crude futures had traded at mostly a
sideways choppy pattern. Yes, there has been a S2-to-S4-per-barrel
increase in prices, but that may have had more to do with cold
weather-related production issues in the Dakotas than actual fear of oil
transportation in the Middle East being disrupted. Lower demand drags
down prices The point is that more traders are beginning to fear a fall
in global demand than they are a supply disruption by militants. Indeed,
the facts so far support the greater risk of the former. One factor is
slower economic growth in Asia, particularly in China. The Hang Seng
Index has shown a 7% to 8% drop since Jan. 1. When you take into account
that China is globally the largest importer of crude oil, traders\'
greater fear of falling demand-as opposed to fallout from the Red Sea
attacks-is understandable. Furthermore, China\'s slow economic recovery
is not the only potential headwind for oil prices. U.S. gasoline demand
also dropped substantially in the last two months. Although a decline
tends to occur this time of year, the degree is what\'s surprising.
Demand for this time of year is well below the five-year average,
according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
This decline might be due to the three-week-long major cold temperatures
seen across the U.S., which may have put a damper on automobile travel.
However, another more lasting factor may be the fact that it now seems
that the Federal Reserve will keep U.S. interest rates higher for longer
than many expected. These higher rates have been weighing on the average
U.S. consumer\'s pocketbook, which includes fuel purchasing. [**[Mideast
conflict still a risk Even though demand is the bigger weight on
traders\' minds right now, the Red Sea attacks and the U.S. \"shadow
war\" with Iran still have the potential to impact the global oil supply
and prices.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Iran currently exports around 1
MMbbl/d. If a major event were to occur-such as the Houthis sinking an
oil tanker, resulting in harder sanctions on Iranian oil-those barrels
of Iranian oil would certainly be missed. That said, the resulting
increase in prices would likely be minimal over the long run, as other
OPEC nations could quickly fill the void. The last major U.S. attack on
Iran was in 1987. At that time, prices bolted approximately 3% higher
the first few days, only to be right back down in the following weeks.
**[[Of course, as with any military engagement, anything can happen, and
a major escalation to ground troop involvement by the U.S. and Iran
could easily cause a very quick, dramatic rise to prices. However, in
the near-term, volatility will remain in focus, though all eyes will be
on Middle East tensions in addition to global
demand]{.mark}.]{.underline}** WWI

Peace is not at hand in the Middle East, and Israel's Prime Minister
Netanyahu remains determined to expand the war. Syria's de facto
partition into Israeli and Turkish territories is the prelude to wider
war with Iran. As the Times of Israel reported last week, [the Israeli
Air Force (**IAF**) has "continued to increase its **readiness** and
**preparations**" for "potential **strikes in Iran**." **Netanyahu's top
priority** is the **destruction** of **Iran** before Russia wraps up its
victory in Ukraine and Syria becomes a new battleground for Turks and
Israelis. It's not simply the end of Washington's "rules-based
international order." It's the **onset** of **chaos**.]{.underline}
Israeli forces and Turkish auxiliaries (i.e. the Islamist terrorists who
sacked Syria) are already staring at each other across a demarcation
line that runs east--west just south of Damascus. Netanyahu harbors no
illusions about the conflict between Ankara's long-term strategic aims
in the region and Jerusalem's determination to claim the Syrian spoils
of war. In addition to serious financial trouble and societal discontent
on the home front, [President-elect Donald **Trump** now **confronts**
the dangerous distraction of **wars** he did not start]{.underline},
wars that will bring his administration and his country no strategic
benefit. [America's underwriting of Netanyahu's expanding war in the
Middle East will endanger U.S. national security and **guarantee** that
**Washington**, its **armed forces**, and the U.S. economy will be
**hostage** to whatever strategic direction **Netanyahu** decides to
take. Starting the war sooner, rather than later, is critical for
Netanyahu. War with Iran presents Trump with a strategic fait accompli.
In case Trump decides to distance the United States from another
bloodbath in the Middle East, Israel's ongoing conflict with **Iran**
and Turkey's potential confrontation with Israel will make
**disengagement impossible**.]{.underline} American policy planners need
to understand the larger context in which this is all unfolding---and
why a war on Iran will ultimately bring us and our alleged Israeli
friends to grief. The principal aim of U.S. foreign policy planners
ought to be the adaptation of the American economy and military
establishment to the multipolar world and the development of new
markets, not new enemies. Washington's refusal to acknowledge the
fundamental shifts in power and wealth lie at the heart of much of the
Biden administration's foreign policy failure. [A **successful**
management of change would **avoid** [a **conflict** with
**Iran**]{.mark}; it would peacefully **reconcile** competing claims to
regional hegemony]{.underline}, as the Chinese recently did with their
brokering of the historic rapprochement between the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran. It would revitalize such
multilateral organizations as the UN Security Council and the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. These actions
would cultivate the emergence of new constellations of power along the
lines of Metternich and Castlereagh's 1815 Concert of Europe. Just as no
question of strategic security in Europe can be solved without Russian
participation, Washington cannot create stability in the Middle East by
unconditionally backing Israel's territorial ambitions. [An American
**failure** to manage its own transition to multipolarity [will]{.mark}
create more **chaos** and **[ignite]{.mark}** a **major war** in the
Middle East, not to mention [a **full blown war** with **Russia**,
and]{.mark}, eventually, **[China]{.mark}**. An outlook that
**prioritizes avoiding conflict**, not starting new conflicts, **must**
replace nearly three decades of feckless leadership in foreign affairs.
New thinking in defense and foreign policy should rank **diplomacy** and
**peaceful coop**eration **first** over the use of **military
power**.]{.underline} Bonaparte quipped that in war, truth is the first
casualty. Nothing has changed since then. Washington is a veritable
fountainhead of lies feeding an unending stream of false narratives
regarding the true character of the jihadist hordes raging across Syria.
For our purposes, however, it is important to note the alignment of
powers behind the Islamist factions now pillaging and terrorizing Syria.
Washington seems blithely oblivious to Syria's destruction and the
emergence of joint Israeli-Turkish hegemony across the Near East. The
disintegration of Syria does, however, open up a short window of
opportunity for Tel Aviv to attack Iran. As the Times of Israel report
noted, while previously the "IAF would not fly directly over Damascus
when carrying out strikes on Iran-linked targets in the capital, it now
can." Netanyahu believes he has the wind at his back: Emboldened by the
collapse of the Assad regime, he will turn his attention to Lebanon,
southern Syria, and the West Bank. [One predictable **consequence** of
[an **attack** on **Iran** will]{.mark} be a **solidifying** of the
Chinese-brokered Iran-Saudi rapprochement---and a **[harden]{.mark}ing**
of the **[blocs]{.mark}** in the Greater Middle East, which will see

Arguing for Mars as a human destination as opposed to a return to the
Moon, Louis Friedman said: "We should go to the Moon, and we did."
[[Mars is]{.mark} far and away [**the single best choice for an initial
extended human presence** beyond]{.mark} Low [Earth]{.mark} Orbit
(LEO)]{.underline}, and there is no obvious "easy" next destination
beyond Mars. If we can't demonstrate that humans can live on Mars, then
we as a species are never going anywhere else beyond Earth. [For humans,
it is **[Mars]{.mark} itself that [is the critical "stepping stone" on
whatever "flexible path" we]{.mark} will end up [follow]{.mark}ing [to
explore the]{.mark} rest of the [solar system and
beyond]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

**Space colonization is key to avert [extinction]{.underline} and solve
[ecological disasters]{.underline} on Earth. That creates an [ethical
obligation]{.underline} to colonize space.**

[[We have an **obligation** to **colonize**]{.mark} outer
[space]{.mark}]{.underline}. This colonization may include establishing
bases on the Moon, Mars, and other bodies in the solar system, perhaps
leading to terraforming some of them, as well as building the sorts of
space colonies championed by Gerard O'Neill.1 By doing so [we may
[**save humanity** from]{.mark} collisions with [**asteroids** and
other]{.mark} **cosmic [catastrophes]{.mark}**, while also bringing
**clean energy** to Earth and giving us access to the **resources** of
the solar system. Carrying out such tasks will]{.underline}, moreover,
[increase our **scientific knowledge**]{.underline} of heaven and Earth.
[A [collision]{.mark} with a **large asteroid** [may bring]{.mark}
**human [life]{.mark}** on Earth [to an **end**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Space colonization would allow human life to **continue**.]{.underline}
Smaller, and far more likely, [collisions will cause **great
destruction** and **kill millions** of people]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[[a]{.mark} heavy [**human presence** throughout the]{.mark} solar
[system]{.mark} would [make it]{.mark}]{.underline} possible, even
[highly **[probable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[that]{.mark} many such
[**collisions** may be **prevented**]{.mark}, thus **saving billions**
of humans]{.underline}, and many other living beings, from a horrible
death. And whether we are able to avert such a catastrophes, [[the
**sun** will]{.mark} become a **red giant**]{.underline} in four or five
billion years; but even [long before then, it will [make the
Earth]{.mark} an **[unbearable]{.mark}** planet]{.underline}. In the
long run, thus, [[space]{.mark} colonization will [give]{.mark}
terrestrial [life **another chance**]{.mark}. [Space **colonization**
will]{.mark} give us many opportunities to **[improve]{.mark} the
[Earth]{.mark}**]{.underline} itself, for example [[by moving
**polluting industries**]{.mark} into **space**[, providing
**clean**]{.mark} **solar [power]{.mark}**]{.underline} from space [at
**reasonable prices**, [and]{.mark} making **available**]{.underline} to
our home planet many of [the **[resources]{.mark}** of the asteroids and
other bodies]{.underline} in the solar system. Doing so will enable us
to increase our knowledge of the universe, and particularly of planetary
science, [which would then permit a **wiser approach** to our own
**planet**]{.underline}. The word limit narrows my scope, and thus I
will concentrate on the likelihood of collisions with comets and
asteroids. [**Gravitational disturbances** of the asteroid
belt]{.underline}, the Kuiper Belt (a little beyond Pluto) or of the
Oort cloud, in the outskirts of the solar system, [send many **large
bodies** towards the **sun**]{.underline}.2 Some of them collide with
the planets and moons of the solar system. Consider that [there are
**trillions** of objects larger than 1 km and **billions** larger than
20 km]{.underline} in the Oort cloud alone. [[Given]{.mark} its
[**position**, and]{.mark} its **[gravitation]{.mark}**, the [Earth
becomes a **target**]{.mark} for collisions]{.underline}. [Even [in
**recent**]{.mark} geologic [times]{.mark}]{.underline} (within the last
100 million years) [large **[meteors]{.mark}** indeed have collided with
the Earth]{.underline}, altered the weather catastrophically [and
[brought **extinction**]{.mark} to the majority of species then
living]{.underline}. One asteroid about 10 km in diameter, now called
the Alvarez asteroid, is held responsible for the disappearance of the
dinosaurs about 65 million years ago,3 although some think a comet may
have been the culprit.4 And in 1994, large fragments of Comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit the atmosphere of Jupiter at velocities over
200,000 km per hour, exploding with a brightness as much as fifty times
that of the entire planet, and ejecting searing materials thousands of
kilometers above the clouds. Had Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit the Earth instead,
we would have gone the way of the dinosaurs.5 Apart from the realization
that our natural history has to make conceptual room for such
catastrophes,6 [there is a **most obvious** practical issue of survival
involved]{.underline}. With a reliable tracking system in place, space
technology might allow us to change the orbits of those comets or
asteroids most in danger of colliding with the Earth. But how worried
should we be? According to present models, meteors large enough to
create Meteor Crater in Arizona would hit an urban area every 100,000
years on average. That meteor was presumably 60 m across; the crater is
1.2 km across. A body with a diameter of 250 m would cause a crater 5 km
across and destroy some 10,000 square Kilometers (about the area of
greater Los Angeles). And global catastrophes would take place every
300,000 years. These would be caused by meteors with a diameter of
approximately 1.7 km.7 What is the evidence for these calculations? Soon
after impact on Earth, craters are attacked by wind, water, life, lava
and a myriad of tectonic motions. In the blink of an eye, geologically
speaking, all obvious traces of them disappear from the surface of our
active planet. But we find a good record on the Moon. And in Venus,
where most of the surface is 600 million years old, the spacecraft
Magellan counted nearly one thousand impact craters at least twice the
diameter of Meteor Crater. Venus is almost the same size as Earth, and
in the Earth's vicinity, and since the impacts are geologically recent,
the Venusian impact record makes it reasonable to fear catastrophic
impact on Earth every half a million years or so.8 Still greater
collisions, with bodies of 5 km across, would happen, on the average
every 20 million years.9 Apart from the asteroid that led to the
extinction of the dinosaurs and the majority of species on Earth 65
million years ago, there have been at least two more impacts by
asteroids 10 km or larger in the last 300 million years.10 [[New
worries]{.mark} have been [caused by]{.mark} the **discovery** of
"**[rogue planets]{.mark}**," i.e. planets [that]{.mark} were
**expelled** from their solar **systems** and boulder their way through
interstellar space]{.underline}. Some will be rocky like the Earth and
some will resemble Jupiter, even much larger, carrying their large moons
with them. [Were one of them to come into our **solar system**, it
[would **disrupt**]{.mark} the **[orbits]{.mark}** of our planets,
perhaps **[sending the Earth]{.mark}** itself [into **interstellar
space**]{.mark}. A [collision would **pulverize** both]{.mark}
bodies]{.underline}. Some scientists think that there are far more rogue
planets than stars in the Milky Way, whereas the lowest estimate of
Jupiter-size rogue planets is that of one per every four stars.11
Whether those of us living today will experience such catastrophes,
[eventually our descendants will be thankful to us for creating a
warning system]{.underline} and the technology to prevent disaster.12
[[There can **hardly** be a **better reason**]{.mark} than the
preservation of life, and perhaps the survival of the species, [to
establish]{.mark} the importance of **[colonizing
space]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [An expansion of [human
**colonies**]{.mark} throughout the solar system would [make it]{.mark}
far [**easier** to reach]{.mark}]{.underline}, say, [[an
**asteroid**]{.mark} in a collision path]{.underline} with the Earth,
[when it is still very far away]{.underline}, and thus when the angle is
small and the necessary alteration of its path will be relatively minor.
Such [[**deflection** can be **accomplished**]{.mark} by several
means]{.underline}: astronauts could make a smaller asteroid collide
with the larger one, or use one of the mass drivers designed by O'Neill.
Nuclear explosions might work also. If we are established in outer
space. To do a proper mission starting from Earth may take many years,
thus making it far less likely to succeed. Robotic deep-space missile
platforms, which can never achieve human flexibility, let alone human
ingenuity, are unlikely solutions, as can be gathered from previous
discussion on robotic missions.13 Now, some philosophers have argued
that we have no obligations to human beings who are not even born, but
that is surely mistaken.14 Otherwise we would have no obligation, say,
to prevent the accumulation of dangerous materials next to the new-born
wing of a hospital, on the grounds that those materials will not reach a
critical stage in less than ten years. A possible explosion then will
kill people not yet born now. And there might even be some who think
that humanity is not worth saving. [Making a case for **what is right**
amounts to providing **reasons for action**, **compelling** reasons for
those who might be called upon to make **great efforts**]{.underline}.15
And it is difficult to imagine that humanity as a whole will come to
hate itself to the degree of accepting extinction. As for those who love
spiders and ragweed more than their fellow humans, they might consider
that [large **cosmic collisions** in the past may have wiped
out]{.underline} between 75% (65 M years ago) and [**96%** of marine
**species on Earth**]{.underline} (presumed collision at the end of the
Permian, 252 M years ago).16 We will not be saving just ourselves. And,
incidentally, [by **colonizing** space we will also be taking other
**terrestrial life** with us]{.underline} into the heavens, for we will
need plants and at least small animals for food, just as we will want
flowers and other ornamental vegetation. Some insects and many bacteria
will be essential to the survival of the other terrestrial life, and so
they must also accompany us. In the case of a final disaster, it is
likely that people would try to save as much of terrestrial life as they
could place in space. Of course, I am not suggesting that space
colonization should be a free-for-all. To give an example, finding life
on Mars, even fossils, would be of such extraordinary scientific
importance that steps must be taken to prevent the loss of such an
opportunity. The important point, though, is that [[in **colonizing**
space we can]{.mark} **endeavor** to [help the **Earth**]{.mark} and
perhaps to **save it**.]{.underline} And when the sun comes to an end,
[we will have allowed humanity and much of Earth life to find places,
sometimes to **build places**, for them to **endure**. [This is]{.mark}
not only [a **high calling**]{.mark} but also one [that we]{.mark}, **as
a species**, [have an **obligation** to **accept**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
H.G. Wells said once that [our choice is the **universe or
nothing**]{.underline}.17 For [failure to move into the cosmos would
**condemn us to oblivion**.]{.underline}

What and Where is the Arctic?

[The Arctic region, or the Arctic, is a geographic region spreading
around the North Pole]{.underline}. There is no single correct
definition of the region as the southern boundary varies.

Key ways to define the Arctic:

The Arctic Circle (66 ° 33\'N) delimits the Arctic in terms of solar
radiation. In theory, areas north of the Arctic Circle have at least one
day without daylight in the winter and at least one nightless night in
the summer. In practice, this does not happen everywhere because the
surface of the earth is uneven, and the light refracts in the
atmosphere.

Based on temperature, the monthly average temperature in the Arctic is
below + 10 ° C throughout the year, even in summer.

The forest line follows a temperature-defined area. The forest line is
not a narrow line but a zone tens of kilometres wide between the
northern coniferous forest and the tundra. In this demarcation, the
Arctic is predominantly wooded tundra and glaciers.

Permafrost increases the area of Russian Arctic compared to the other
delimitations. Permafrost is soil that stays frozen for at least two
consecutive years.

[The [**ice cover** determines the Arctic nature of marine areas. **Sea
ice** is]{.mark} highest in February-March and [lowest in September. The
**surface** of the Arctic ice is **monitored** almost in **real time**
by **satellites**]{.mark}.]{.underline} (see The National Snow and Ice
Data Centre)

Culturally defined, the Arctic covers the homelands of northern
indigenous peoples.

Political delimitations vary according to how they serve, for example,
the interests of states or international cooperation.

[[As the climate **warms**, the Arctic **shrinks**]{.mark} if defined by
temperature, forest line, permafrost, or ice cover.]{.underline}
Cultural and political boundaries also vary. The Arctic Circle is the
most permanent of the delimitations, although also the polar circle
moves very slowly due to the variation of the Earth\'s axial tilt.

[[A **surge** in]{.mark} aggressive space **[ventures]{.mark}** in
recent years [has seen a **build-up** of]{.mark} space
[junk]{.mark},]{.underline} and they are set to grow exponentially, Nobu
Okada, founder and CEO of Astroscale, told CNBC at the World Economic
Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin, China.

"[Over the last 5 to 7 years, [we saw]{.mark}]{.underline} (about)
[**[2,000]{.mark}** space [ventures]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}.
Their plans are so aggressive, [[they're going to launch]{.mark} 10,000
to **[20,000]{.mark} [satellites]{.mark}** [over the next]{.mark} 5 to
[10 years]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. "[We see the **exponential
growth**]{.underline} of objects in space."

[[There are more than **500,000 pieces** of junk]{.mark} floating
[around **Earth's orbit**]{.mark}, including defunct satellites, rocket
boosters, nuts and bolts, all of which pose a substantial
threat]{.underline} to astronauts and spacecraft, according to U.S.
space agency NASA. The European Space Agency said that as of January
2018, [[there are about]{.mark} 29,000 objects larger than 10
centimeters]{.underline}, around 750,000 objects that range between 1 cm
to 10 cm [and about **[166 million objects]{.mark}** between 1
millimeter to 1 cm in size.]{.underline}

Okada said that pieces of debris fly around the Earth throughout the
day, and there are plenty of near-miss situations where two objects
almost collide. When they do hit each other, those collisions end up
creating even more debris.

"Even the small particle caused by the collision has enough power to
blow up a satellite," he said. "If we continue the chain reactions of
the collisions, we won't be able to put our space assets into space. So
it's now (that) we have to remove large objects from space."

**But the plan solves - sensors important to space sustainability.**

[[One important element in fostering **space sustainability** is]{.mark}
the necessity [to be able to **detect and track** active space
**objects**]{.mark}, as well as space objects [of all sizes and **model
their orbits**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is called situational
awareness. [[This can be done by having **sensors**]{.mark} either in
space or [on the **ground**]{.mark}]{.underline} with sophisticated data
analysis. Another important element is to ensure that satellites which
are already in space are repaired, retrofitted, or have a life
extension. This is called "In-orbit servicing solutions" and involves
replenishing consumables and degradables (e.g. propellants, batteries,
solar array) or enhancing the mission through hardware upgrades. The
first commercial in-orbit servicing mission was launched in 2019, by a

[[Any response to]{.mark} the changing [Arctic security]{.mark}
environment [requires]{.mark} addressing [several]{.mark} key
[concerns]{.mark}.]{.underline} The first is analyzing the
vulnerabilities that impede the ability of Arctic states to credibly and
capably both deter and fight in the High North. At least partially due
to the absence of an independent command, control, communications,
computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR)
capability, situational awareness is a vulnerability of particular
significance.5 Arctic states are instead dependent on vulnerable
undersea communications infrastructure, or space-based capabilities that
are relatively scarce and characterized by intra-alliance dependency on
the United States.6 Additionally, Europe's reliance on Norway as an
energy provider is vulnerable to Russian gray-zone tactics.7 

 The second concern is addressing these vulnerabilities, taking stock of
which technological capabilities will make a difference and how lessons
from the war in Ukraine can be efficiently applied to strategy and force
postures. [[The most immediate priority]{.mark} to alleviate Arctic
security concerns [should be]{.mark} bolstering [maritime domain
awareness]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}, which directly impacts
European energy security as well as nuclear security and deterrence by
enhancing NATO's ability to detect, monitor, and respond to potential
threats. [[Ukraine]{.mark} has [demonstrated]{.mark} the utility and
[resiliency of advanced space]{.mark} capabilities [and unmanned
systems]{.mark} when used in nonpermissive environments.]{.underline} As
[[Arctic geography]{.mark} already [creates dependency on satellites,
investing]{.mark} in space capabilities [should be a main
priority]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, certain configurations of
unmanned systems can cost-efficiently bolster both situational awareness
and offensive options in Arctic security.

Space capabilities 

 **[[Space-based surveillance]{.mark} capabilities [are integral to
domain awareness.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[The US is]{.mark} generally
[lacking Arctic]{.mark}-specific **[space capabilities]{.mark}**. The
situation is [compounded by]{.mark} the region's high latitude,
provoking [**coverage gaps**, as well as]{.mark} unique
**[electromagnetic disruptions]{.mark}**.]{.underline}153

 Today, spatial resolution with current satellites is high enough to
track and monitor movements in the Arctic. **[[What is
lacking]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[is increased resolution and
year-round]{.mark} high-resolution [imagery]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
this context, synthetic aperture radar (**[[SAR]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
imaging onboard satellites [[offers an innovative
tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} for greater resolution 28 and
near-real-time imagery. **[The technology has become [paramount for
polar observation]{.mark}, navigation, [and]{.mark} overall [Arctic
ISR]{.mark}. ]{.underline}**

 **[SAR allows seeing through thick Arctic cloud
coverage]{.underline}**, an important feature for low Earth orbit
circumpolar observation. [SAR]{.underline} represents a booming
technology, [primarily carried by private companies,]{.underline}
especially from Arctic nations such as Finland's ICEYE.154 In the coming
decades, quantum computing will offer solutions for ground-based space
stations and satellite antennas. 

**[[Satellite tech]{.mark}nology is [paramount for Arctic]{.mark}
communications and [connectivity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Many projects
are at play, such as the new polar Enhanced Satellite Communication
Project funded by Canada155 and the recent arrival of Starlink for basic
connectivity in the Arctic. The recent signature of a partnership
between the US and Norway to jointly launch and deploy polar-dedicated
satellites is another positive step forward.156 

 On top of space-based assets, ground stations will also have to be
upgraded to download the exponential data traffic. In the future,
[[ground stations might be]{.mark} entirely [replaced by satellite
relays]{.mark} directly embedded in the satellite
constellations[.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[More satellites, and]{.mark}
more [launchpads]{.mark} for satellites, [will be necessary as well

[[The]{.mark} strategic [utility of an Arctic presence is
**considerable** for **early warning**]{.mark} purposes.]{.underline}
Its geographical location makes the [Arctic [an important vantage point
for monitoring]{.mark} potential ballistic [missile launches and]{.mark}
other [airborne threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}12 [Russia and [the United
States]{.mark}---with its allies---[depend on Arctic infrastructure

through ground-based radars and ground stations for satellite

decidedly [prioritizing space]{.mark} and new technologies, and it is
with Russia's cooperation that China is seeking to develop and deploy
its own early warning infrastructure.]{.underline}13 

 More broadly, with their increasing dependence on space-based
capabilities for advanced warfare, states seeking global or Arctic
regional coverage for their space systems are reliant on ground
infrastructure in the Arctic due to its latitude-restricting coverage.14
The Arctic is also an ideal location for this type of infrastructure.
Particularly for states with ambitions of global space-power projection
such as the United States and China, this incentivizes a growing
physical presence in the Arctic to support developing space
infrastructure, including dual-use projects.15 [[China]{.mark} has

The United States has maintained territorial claims and has advanced
political, economic, national security, environmental, and cultural
interests within the Arctic region since the 1867 acquisition of Alaska.
The Arctic Council and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea (UNCLOS) are avenues to engage our partners to promote a stable and
secure Arctic[. Commercial [satellite data, including]{.mark} enhanced
[communications]{.mark}, navigation and timing, and remote sensing,
[will play a key role in]{.mark} establishing persistent [situational

commercial satellite capabilities that the United States can meet its
economic, national security, and environmental imperatives. 

This chapter provides an overview of U.S. Arctic policy and national
interests and describes how commercial satellite services can provide
domain awareness to observe and adapt to the region's rapidly changing
conditions. [[While geopolitical tension is rising]{.mark} in the
Arctic, [stakeholders will benefit from sharing satellite data]{.mark}
with each other and the public. [Sharing can enhance operations,

Addressing Hybrid Threats and Asymmetric Challenges 

[A [complex]{.mark} interplay of [hybrid threats]{.mark} and asymmetric
challenges further [characterize]{.mark}s [the Arctic's security]{.mark}
landscape.]{.underline} From cyberattacks on critical infrastructure to
gray-zone activities that blur the lines between military and civilian
operations, the region requires a flexible, multi-domain response.
Conference sessions highlighted the need for tailored strategies to
counter these threats. [[Discussions on **radar**]{.mark} upgrades,
**information** sharing, [and **space-based capabilities** were]{.mark}
identified as **[essential components]{.mark}** of Arctic
defense.]{.underline} Additionally, the conference emphasized the
importance of proactive campaign planning to address potential crises
before they escalate. 

 Hybrid threats in the Arctic can take many forms, including
misinformation campaigns, economic coercion, and critical infrastructure
sabotage. Addressing these threats requires a comprehensive approach
integrating military, financial, and diplomatic tools. [[Enhancing
cyber]{.mark} resilience, improving [intelligence-sharing]{.mark}
mechanisms, [and]{.mark} developing [rapid response capabilities are
essential for]{.mark} mitigating the impact of [hybrid
threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} 

 The Role of the U.S. in Arctic Security 

[ As the Arctic gains prominence in global geopolitics, **[the U.S. must
lead]{.mark}** in shaping [the region's future]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
ASDC underscored the need for sustained investment in Arctic-specific
capabilities, from icebreakers and satellite systems to training
programs tailored to the region's unique challen[ges. [The **U.S. must
prioritize Arctic security**]{.mark} **in its defense
planning.**]{.underline} This includes developing a comprehensive
strategy that integrates soft and hard power dynamics, aligns with the
interests of Arctic nations, and addresses emerging threats.
[[Maintaining a consistent presence]{.mark} in the region [is crucial to
deterring adversaries]{.mark} and reassuring allies.]{.underline}

[[**China is expanding its Arctic** presence]{.mark} by developing
**infrastructure**]{.underline} in the global commons that intersect
with the region. [Operations [in **outer space**]{.mark}, the deep sea
and cyberspace minimise the need for terrestrial footholds and generate
data, a virtual resource.]{.underline} To analyse the epistemic and
geopolitical consequences of developing the Arctic global commons as a
vertically and digitally integrated volume, we examine [[a critical form
of Chinese '**remote infrastructure'**]{.mark}: optical, synthetic
aperture radar, and navigation satellites.]{.underline} We argue that
first, by generating data about the Arctic, [[these]{.mark} instruments
[turn China into a regional **knowledge producer**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Second, as remote observations outnumber field observations, [[Chinese
polar science may **shift the regional balance**]{.mark} of knowledge
towards spaceborne and marine observations.]{.underline} Third, China\'s
emergence as an Arctic knowledge producer may motivate the state to
contribute to regional governance as remote sensing and large-scale,
computationally intensive techniques become privileged decision-making
tools. [To transcend the terrestrial and maritime fixes that predominate
research on China and the Arctic, [we call for greater attention to the

[[China is likely to continue pursuing]{.mark} this **['reverse
access']{.mark}** to the Arctic from space]{.underline}, especially as
Beijing encounters growing geopolitical obstacles to participating in
the space sector in the Arctic itself. As one example, in 2018, seeking
to deepen science cooperation between China and Arctic states, [MOST
published guidelines calling for 'one Arctic ground station able to
receive data from no less than five China-European satellites' and 'two
to three joint observation stations in the Arctic in order to provide
China-European satellite-based remote sensing monitoring and forecasting
products and for supporting research vessels and commercial traffic in
the Arctic]{.underline}' (MOST, 2018). Ground stations in the Arctic
regularly and rapidly downlink data from polar orbiting satellites when
they pass overhead, making them a critical segment of both Arctic and
Earth observation. [[**Demand** for polar orbiting satellites is
**growing worldwide** because]{.mark} their daily [planetary
**coverage** makes them **useful** for]{.mark} Earth observation and
**[surveillance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Potentially creating issues for
China, in 2020, the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), a state-owned
company, decided not to renew its contracts with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences\' (CAS) Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth. Since
2016, SSC had allowed CAS access to ground station operations at the
Esrange Space Center outside Kiruna, Sweden in order to downlink data
from Chinese satellites. Anni Bölenius, head of communications at SSC,
explained to Reuters (2020), 'The geopolitical situation has changed
since these contracts were signed in the early 2000s\'.  

Recognising the vulnerability of ground stations on foreign soil,
[[Chinese]{.mark} scientists have [called for accelerating]{.mark} the
construction of [satellite **ground stations**]{.mark} in
Antarctica]{.underline}, over which polar orbiting satellites pass as
they wend their way around a new line of longitude with each progressive
encirclement of the Earth. Infrastructuring the commons of outer space
still demands infrastructure on Earth. As such, an article drawing on
interviews with Liu Jianqiang, deputy director of the National Satellite
Ocean Application Center, and Cheng Xiao, Dean of the School of
Surveying and Mapping Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, a
leader in polar satellite research and design within China, encouraged
the country to build ground stations around its research stations in
Antarctica (Chinese Society of Surveying and Mapping, 2022)---another
global commons where access is more reliable than within other
countries\' sovereign territory. 

 [[As **possibilities** for China]{.mark} to participate in the
development of space [in the Arctic **narrow**, the state is
pursuing]{.mark} the development of [the Arctic from space]{.mark}. In
this effort, **[satellite missions comprise a key vertical
inroad]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Three types of satellites offer China a
means of imaging the Arctic, seeing through clouds and the polar night,
and assisting with navigation, respectively: (1) optical; (2) SAR; and
(3) position, navigation and timing (PNT). Below, we detail these
spaceborne instruments, which enable China to accumulate the data
necessary to inform interventions in regional governance, thereby
strengthening its epistemic capacities and, consequently, its potential
to influence regional geopolitics.

[**[Satellite observations reveal]{.mark}** that the extent of sea
[ice]{.mark} in the Arctic [is]{.mark} once again [hovering near record
lows]{.mark} for this time of year]{.underline} -- underscoring a
troubling and persistent trend. This issue is a key topic at ESA's
Living Planet Sympos

ium in Vienna, where scientists are emphasising the critical role that
ESA's Climate Change Initiative Sea Ice Project and CryoSat mission have
had in helping to underpin these findings. Looking ahead, the ability to
monitor polar sea ice is in safe hands, as the development of the new
CRISTAL mission is progressing well and the first satellite will be
ready for launch in the second half of 2027. 

[**[Thanks to satellites carrying radar]{.mark} instruments, [we have
year-round observations]{.mark}** of the remote Arctic and Antarctic
polar regions]{.underline}, which are shrouded in darkness during their
long winter months. [Over decades, [satellites]{.mark} have [allowed
scientists to witness how]{.mark} the sea [ice]{.mark} in both regions
naturally [grows]{.mark} during the winter [and declines]{.mark} during
the summer, [along with the toll that the climate crisis is
having]{.mark} on this fragile component of our Earth
system.]{.underline} Sea ice plays a complex role in the climate system.
As ice declines the amount of sunlight absorbed by the ocean increases,
leading to warmer ocean waters. As well as affecting water temperature,
when ice melts the surface waters become less saline -- these changes in
temperature and salinity contribute to modifications in ocean
circulation patterns, which in turn influence weather systems and
climate across the planet. The Arctic, often referred to as the 'canary
in the coal mine', is at the frontline of climate change, warming faster
than anywhere else on the planet. This is leading to knock-on effects,
known as Arctic amplification, that have profound implications for the
rest of the world. [ESA's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) [Sea
Ice]{.mark} Project **[datasets]{.mark}, [compiled from]{.mark} various
[satellite]{.mark}** altimeter [data]{.mark} such as that from ESA's

For the past 25 years, [[Arctic nations have

cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} on climate, scientific and
environmental issues. The notion that the region was exempt from more

[[Accidental Escalation of Tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}

We have already referred to accidental tension escalation [[in relation
to Russia and China]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Better **domain awareness
and communications** are particularly important]{.underline}]{.mark} for
this issue. Crucially, [[sending more strategic assets to the Arctic
could work at odds with goals of reducing tensions. Thus, capabilities

and maintaining a presence in support of safety, security, and
stewardship [[within the Arctic **as opposed to** global power
projection assets]{.underline}]{.mark} in service of other security
needs [[would be **best** to avoid capacity growth becoming an
escalation problem unto itself. Normalizing]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.
federal-level presence, activities, and exercises in the Arctic region
in the service of [[regional security would also be preferable for
alleviating any risks of accidental escalation **rather than** periodic
or inconsistent forays]{.underline}]{.mark} into the Far North, [[which

it]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Further complicated by the effects of climate change is that [[the

[[Maintaining a persistent presence in support of]{.underline}]{.mark}
safety, security, and [[stewardship rather than global power projection
assets is achievable]{.underline}]{.mark}. It includes the construction

perform SAR, and conduct vessel safety and security checks. Under Title
10, USCG vessels can also engage other military assets. It often does so

[[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} [[upgrading]{.underline}]{.mark}

interoperability, national leaders would be hard pressed to seek
cooperation with a historic adversary (Weitsman 2014, 37). [[This
dynamic is exacerbated by]{.underline}]{.mark} the general lack of
Arctic-specific institutions. By virtue of [[its founding
documents]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the Arctic Council is **prohibited**

[[means]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[issues related to Arctic
securitization tend to be dealt with on an ad hoc

[[climate change, environmental protection, or human

The Arctic has gained increasing attention from defense and intelligence
policymakers concerned about great power conflict in the High North.
[[United States-Russian competition]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region
[[over polar shipping]{.underline}]{.mark} routes and natural resources
[[seemingly contradicts]{.underline}]{.mark} institutional [[commitments
to retain the Arctic as a "low tension zone."]{.underline}]{.mark}
Superpowers and their allies are receiving international condemnation
for advancing kinetic military activity in the region while constituents
and interest groups are instead advocating for diplomacy and cooperative
restraint. As a result, [[Arctic nations are turning towards extensive
reconnaissance]{.underline}]{.mark} and monitoring of the region [[to
deter conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. This study draws on strategy
documents from each of the eight Arctic nations, scholarly research, and
news coverage to assemble a picture of current efforts at
technology-enabled monitoring. It also examines the potential of
technologies such as long-range surveillance drones, satellites, and
seabed monitors to facilitate near-constant reconnaissance by polar
powers. The current deterrence mindset of Arctic security postures bears
comparison with Cold War-era efforts [[to prevent outright conflict via
monitoring and mitigation strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}. This study
provides a historic account of Arctic intelligence in the 20th century
and uses a comparative approach to assess what aspects of the
contemporary situation are genuinely new and which may benefit from
lessons of the Cold War. It concludes with policy recommendations for
Arctic states [[to implement cohesive northern
monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark} strategies into their intelligence
organizations as well as long-term guidelines for new multilateral fora
focused explicitly on Arctic security issues.

[[The United States must possess control over its Arctic
narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}. As DoD, DHS, service component, and
other U.S. Arctic strategies indicate, [[the United States **is** an
Arctic country]{.underline}]{.mark}. All too often, the American public
forgets that the United States is an Arctic country [[with statutory and
tactical responsibilities to Americans who reside in the region, as well
as significant strategic interests, **such as ISR**]{.underline}]{.mark}
operations, NORAD, and supporting Indigenous peoples' ways of life, both
at the local level and through such international organizations as the
Arctic Council. [[The United States can **maintain control** over its
Arctic narrative through]{.underline}]{.mark} the construction of PSCs
and ASCs, [[**enhancing** existing Arctic
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, finding new ways to deepen
collaboration with Indigenous communities, hosting more visits from U.S.

U.S. accomplishments and the importance of continued multilateral
cooperation in the Arctic.

Over the last fifteen years, [[Arctic states have begun to expand polar
military deployments]{.underline}]{.mark}, either
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the construction of [[new
bases]{.underline}]{.mark} or the refurbishment of 20 th century
installations.

Importantly, all these revitalized Arctic bases include a robust
intelligence unit (Raymond 2016, 11-2; Bye 2018, 22; US Department of
Defense 2011, 29) --- northern states have invested in monitoring the
situation even as they demonstrate their ability to fight. This idea,
that [[information becomes essential when geopolitics **limits** the use
of kinetic force]{.underline}]{.mark}, was also evident during the Cold
War. A description of US Arctic submarine policy in the 1960s perhaps
best exemplifies this dynamic:

[[Since using even conventional offensive weapons could easily
precipitate horrible and nearly uncontrollable geopolitical
consequences, undersea warriors measured **victory** in terms of
surveillance, detection and constant
**monitoring**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If you knew the enemy, his vehicle
or ship, his location and capability, and could follow or 'shadow' him
without betraying yourself, you claimed victory by Cold War standards
(Weir 2005, 414).

[[In a deterrence situation, information is king.
Increased]{.underline}]{.mark} collection of
[[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} data and the ability to derive
strategic intelligence products [[**reduces the risk of hot conflict**
among long-standing geopolitical rivals]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if it
does not lead to outright cooperation.

[[Radar]{.underline}]{.mark}, a relatively new technology in the 1940s,
[[proved a vital component of]{.underline}]{.mark} surveillance and
[[monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark} during World War II. In the Aleutian
theater, the US rapidly constructed radar stations after Japan's capture
of the Attu and Kiska islands in 1942, surveilling Axis progress into
the polar region until the islands could be recaptured in 1943 (Charles
River Editors 2016, 90-4). During the Cold War, however, the Arctic
gained unique strategic importance as a region geographically destined
to be a superpower highway, "since the polar route between Moscow and
Washington is the shortest" (English and Thvedt 2018, 339). As missile
defense became a crucial element of Arctic states' intelligence
strategies, radar once again came into favor [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
its [[long-range surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities. The US,
Canada, and Denmark collaborated on the [[Distant Early Warning (DEW)
radar]{.underline}]{.mark} belt spanning North America (Huebert 2011,
813) with a subsidiary radar station at Keflavik Air Base in Iceland.
The Soviet Union answered by constructing the Missile Attack Warning
System (SPRN) series of radar stations (English and Thvedt 2018,
339-40), supported by airbases and anti-aircraft batteries along the
country's northern coast. (Aliyev 2019). While radar belts [[were
effective at]{.underline}]{.mark} detecting incoming missiles and
[[tracking]{.underline}]{.mark} the movement of [[enemy
assets]{.underline}]{.mark}, their insight into the strategic
decision-making of rivals was very limited. The North Americans sought
to compensate for this through a series of radio intercept stations to
gather information on the USSR. Canada's proximity to the Soviet Arctic
made it the ideal partner for this undertaking. With US support
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the newly created North American
Aerospace Defense Command ([[NORAD]{.underline}]{.mark}), Canada
relocated all its existing signals intelligence assets from southerly
regions to northerly ones throughout the 1940s and 50s. This network of
remote listening posts, including the Alert station at the northern tip
of the country, proved invaluable to the US and its allies, routinely
intercepting military communications from Soviet Siberian bases (Wark
2020, 320-6).

Today, radar station belts remain one of the primary permanent sources
of Arctic intelligence (Charron 2015, 228-9) with both the DEW and SPRN
systems still in operation. (US Department of Defense 2019). Since 2014,
Russia has taken steps to bolster its Arctic position by refurbishing
Soviet-era radar posts in the Far North. These projects are officially
tied to civilian purposes such as resource exploration or search and
rescue (Rotnem 2018, 4).

However, the focus on installations directly paralleling US bases in
Greenland (Rahbek-Clemmensen 2020, 6) plus extensive investments in new
long-range systems (Devyatkin 2018) suggest at least some degree of
military or intelligence involvement. The [[Russian buildup of Arctic
surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities [[has sparked similar
investments in North America]{.underline}]{.mark} to re-operationalize
Cold War assets. The US is enhancing ground-based surveillance and
[[early warning]{.underline}]{.mark} installations in Alaska and
Greenland (Atland 2014, 154-5), sponsoring development of longer-range
radar capabilities (English and Thvedt 2018, 345), [[and putting
pressure on Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark} to expand radar stations [[in
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} (Rahbek-Clemmensen 2020, 7) and the Faroe
Islands (Black 2021).

(ermo-MSDI, acc 7-2-2025)

In the 21 st century, [[every Arctic nation has
continued]{.underline}]{.mark} this pattern of [[aerial
reconnaissance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Canada (Boring 2014, 26), Denmark
(The Danish Government 2018, 25-6), and the US (US Department of Defense
2019, 9) have all increased intelligence flyovers to monitor Russia's
buildup in the region, and NATO has committed to enhanced aerial
surveillance of the Northern Atlantic (US Department of Defense 2011, 3;
14). [[The dramatic escalation in the frequency of Arctic spy flights
prompted a Russian defense official to complain]{.underline}]{.mark}
that NATO reconnaissance planes "carry out flights almost daily"
(Sputnik News 2014), even as the US, Finland, and Norway bemoan Russian
surveillance planes in their airspace (Raymond 2016, 11-2). Although the
Scandinavian states have resisted joining NATO-led flyovers of Russia,
both Norway (Bye 2018, 22-3) and Finland (Lee 2020) have upgraded their
domestic aerial reconnaissance capabilities, and Finland, Sweden,
Norway, and Iceland regularly carry out joint air-surveillance exercises
(Prime Minister's Office: Finland 2013, 41).

[[An emerging area of innovation in Arctic intelligence is
collection]{.underline}]{.mark} facilitated [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
unmanned aerial vehicles ([[UAVs]{.underline}]{.mark}). Several Arctic
states have already purchased or produced Arctic surveillance drones,
including Denmark (Black 2021), Canada, and the US However, the high
winds, low temperatures, winter darkness, and limited satellite
communications in the Far North mean that few drones currently on the
market have the endurance to consistently operate in Arctic environments
(Humpert 2019). Russia's Arctic UAV program has so far shown the most
promise, in part because of the extensive network of drone bases
throughout the Russian Arctic that support maintenance and forward
operations (Devyatkin 2018). Moscow's ZALA UAV series constitutes large
drones capable of collecting images from more than 100 km away (Aliyev
2019), devices which have already been spotted in Scandinavian airspace
(Boulegue 2019, 17). Kremlin scientists are also reportedly developing a
surveillance drone capable of remaining aloft for days at a time, even
in the harshest Arctic conditions (Humpert 2019).

Abstract. The article discusses the new US military strategy in the
Arctic, announced by the administration of J. Biden in July 2024. It
replaced a similar document issued under D. Trump in 2019. The authors
raise the question of what has changed in the approaches to Arctic
security, given the sharp nature of the contradictions between
Republicans and Democrats. The article demonstrates that, in general,
the US Arctic military policy has maintained continuity; the only
difference is the attempt of the Democrat administration to formulate
more specific areas of activity to protect US security interests. In the
text of the strategy, when assessing threats, China, not Russia, is
placed in the first place in terms of importance. At the same time, the
formulation of threats to US security in the region is too general and
seems far-fetched. The main areas of implementation of the current US
military strategy include [[measures to develop communication, command,
control and intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} systems; to improve
military infrastructure; to strengthen the US and NATO military presence
in the Nordic countries and to develop defense cooperation. [[In
general]{.underline}]{.mark}, the strategy [[is **confrontational** in
nature, especially since the US]{.underline}]{.mark}, having obtained
geopolitical benefits after Finland and Sweden joined NATO, [[clearly
intends to use them to gain **unilateral**
advantages]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, there are limiting conditions
that will prevent the US from fully realizing the plans of this
strategy. [[The main threat to Russia's security]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the region [[is the]{.underline}]{.mark} constant military presence and
[[build-up of]{.underline}]{.mark} US/NATO [[military infrastructure in
close proximity to]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[Arctic borders, as well as
Washington's intention to implement]{.underline}]{.mark} the principle
of [["freedom of navigation" in the]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic Ocean,
including the [[Northern Sea Route]{.underline}]{.mark}.

New emphases have emerged in [[Biden's Arctic military
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Firstly, the United States [[is
introducing the Arctic into NATO's area of
responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}. In particular, it is noted that
strengthening the NATO bloc in the Arctic will facilitate the
implementation of the US military strategy in the region. This confirms
the assumption that the alliance will continue [[to serve primarily the
interests of the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is noteworthy
that each time the mention of the Arctic states in the text of the
strategy is accompanied by an indication of [[their membership in
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[emphasizing]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
sovereign member states of the alliance will be ensured their
[[collective security]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Secondly, [[the inclusion of Sweden and Finland in the NATO bloc
significantly expands]{.underline}]{.mark} the strategic
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} of the United States:

> military potential concentrated in the North American part of the
> Arctic will serve as the northern flank for operations in the
> Indo-Pacific region;
>
> strengthening control in the European part of the Arctic significantly
> facilitates the task of projecting forces into Europe and protecting
> sea lanes between North America and Europe 6 .

In general, [[the new strategy continues the long-term US policy of
achieving global dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}, outlining a broader
strategic perspective. The "turn to the East" in order to control energy
supplies to China from the sea along the "Persian Gulf South China Sea
East China Sea" line began under B. Obama \[6, Konyshev V.N., Sergunin
A.A.\] and then continued under D. Trump. But if under B. Obama China
was considered a rival, then under D. Trump it was transferred to the
category of "revisionist" countries that pose a threat to US interests
in the Indo-Pacific region \[7, Ivanov O.P.\]. J. [[Biden's military
strategy links the Arctic and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Indo-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark} region [[for a global confrontation
with China.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The first direction is related to the [[development of systems for
monitoring the operational environment]{.underline}]{.mark} and
reconnaissance of enemy actions in the interests of high-tech joint
forces, designed to carry out a wide range of military and non-military
missions in the Arctic. For this purpose, the plans [[include further
improvement of]{.underline}]{.mark} the integrated military control
system [[C4ISR]{.underline}]{.mark} (Command, Control, Communications,
Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance). [[Particular
attention will be paid to increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[satellite constellation]{.underline}]{.mark} to ensure stable
communications and improving the [[early warning]{.underline}]{.mark}
system for a missile attack. The US cooperates with Norway in this area
16. About 250 new aircraft (mainly F-35 fighters) will be deployed in
NATO Arctic states. In her comments on the strategy, US Undersecretary
of Defense for Political Affairs Kathleen Hicks clarified that the
Arctic will be used to test artificial intelligence systems and unmanned
platforms 17 .

According to the text of the strategy, the
[[reconnaissance]{.underline}]{.mark} system [[should be based
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the continued modernization of the US-Canadian
[[NORAD]{.underline}]{.mark} system, which combines air defense and
missile defense functions, as well as radars installed in Northern
European countries. Western experts note that NORAD is "capable of
detecting and tracking certain targets" (in other words, not all
targets) 18. Canada will actively participate in the modernization,
having allocated \$27.8 billion for these purposes in 2022.

Another NORAD function being developed is [[maritime
surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition, the Department of
Defense is expected to invest in projects for the use of unmanned aerial
vehicles. The plan is to ensure data exchange between land, sea, air,
and space-based platforms not only in the United States and Canada, but
also in European Arctic states.

Under the NORAD modernization agreement announced by the US and Canadian
defense ministers in 2021, [[most of the projects will be completed by
2030, including]{.underline}]{.mark} the introduction of
[[over-the-horizon radars]{.underline}]{.mark} to increase NORAD's
range; [[underwater sensors]{.underline}]{.mark} off the coast of North
America; [[advanced navigation]{.underline}]{.mark} systems to
complement the existing [[GPS, satellite and radio communications
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} for the Canadian armed forces; and the
delivery of improved short-, medium and long-range air-to-air missiles
19 .

[[However, the United States has yet to achieve **full coverage** of the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} with a system of communications satellites
above 65 degrees north latitude. [[Electromagnetic
interference]{.underline}]{.mark} typical of Arctic latitudes
objectively [[hampers stable communications]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
this purpose, it is planned to use military and commercial satellites of
the United States and its European NATO allies. In addition, [[by 2030,
it will be necessary to ensure the transfer of large amounts of
data]{.underline}]{.mark} via communication systems [[to support the
aviation group]{.underline}]{.mark}, unmanned aerial vehicles, the
unified radar system, near-Earth satellites and other infrastructure 20.

[[The third direction of strategy implementation is ensuring a military
presence in the Arctic through]{.underline}]{.mark} independent and
[[joint exercises, patrols, and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[permanent
deployment]{.underline}]{.mark} of joint forces in Alaska, which form
the first line of deterrence against the enemy.

[[The strategy envisages a further increase in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
intensity of [[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic,
[[including]{.underline}]{.mark} the most important ones for the
Department of Defense --- [[Arctic Edge; Northern
Edge]{.underline}]{.mark} (involving Indo-Pacific Command); [[Ice
Camp]{.underline}]{.mark} (submarine fleet);
[[Nanook]{.underline}]{.mark} (Northern Command and NORAD); [[Noble

[[Nordic Response, Dynamic Mongoose]{.underline}]{.mark},[[Arctic

For illustration: 20 thousand military personnel from 13 NATO countries
took part in the Nordic Response exercises in Northern Norway from March
3 to 14, 2024 alone. Fifty submarines, frigates, corvettes, aircraft
carriers, amphibious ships, 100 fighters, transport aircraft, and
maritime reconnaissance aircraft were involved 25. In turn, they were
only part of the Steadfast Defender exercises, which took place in
JanuaryJune with the participation of 90 thousand military personnel
from 31 NATO countries --- [[the largest exercise since the Cold
War]{.underline}]{.mark} and aimed at practicing the alliance's actions
in the event of an attack by Russia (including the transfer of forces
from the United States, landing from the sea, and strategic deployment)

Tightly-coupled intelligence institutions

[[Although there are no intelligence bodies specifically focused on the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} regions, there are three multilateral
intelligence-sharing institutions with a critical mass of Arctic states
as members: [[NORAD, Five Eyes, and NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. Not only
have these institutions existed for sixty years or more, but they [[have
evolved]{.underline}]{.mark} into more mainstreamed bodies. In the 20 th
century, Denmark (Morrison 2014, 583), Norway (Trellevik 2019),
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Canada (Wark 2020, 325) [[contributed
intelligence products to multilateral security fora]{.underline}]{.mark}
with the explicitly stated goal of remaining under the protection of
conventional American forces and the US nuclear umbrella. Today, these
institutions have their own intelligence capabilities with staff
operators drawn from all member states (Von Loringhoven 2019). [[As
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} collection and analysis [[become more
onerous]{.underline}]{.mark} due to increased quantities of data,
[[collaboration among allies will only increase]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Hare and Coghill 2016, 869), [[especially in]{.underline}]{.mark} areas
of shared interest, such as [[Arctic securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Bury and Chertoff 2020, 51).

Strengthen Deterrence

The [[Arctic 7 and interested NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as
the United Kingdom, [[must remain focused on]{.underline}]{.mark}
current and future [[Russian encroachments and constant probing of
NATO's air, land, and maritime sovereignty across the circumpolar
Arctic. Efforts should focus on denying Russia the use of its asymmetric
enablers, including A2AD systems and electronic
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} (EW) capabilities, and address any
ambitions toward out of area denial.

[[To strengthen allied capabilities and posture, domain awareness is
critical. This includes both Maritime Domain
Awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}, integrated air and space defense, and
[[better communications]{.underline}]{.mark} and ground-based [[space
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. The United States and NATO should also
give specific attention to countering [[and detecting unmanned
underwater vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly in the North
Atlantic. In addition, efforts to strengthen NATO's Integrated Air and
Missile Defense (IAMD) and the formal integration of highly capable and
interoperable Nordic Air Forces into IAMD will significantly enhance
NATO's and the Arctic 7's air defenses. Beyond capabilities,
[[communication and information sharing with allies and partners will
need to be optimized]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The United States, NATO, and bilateral partners should do more to
coordinate military exercises and joint drills [[to avoid duplication of
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as create an enhanced and
persistent presence [[which will ensure a more credible NATO
posture]{.underline}]{.mark}. Concurrently, NATO should launch a
coordinated strategic communications plan regarding activities in the
Arctic. This is true both for communication with allies and partners and
the broader global community, as well as [[signaling toward Russia and
China]{.underline}]{.mark}. With regard to Russia, [[**clarity** of
messaging and communication]{.underline}]{.mark} via existing working
channels [[will remain important]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The United States and its Arctic partners should reinforce political
cohesion and resilience in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and
proactively strengthen unity of purpose and societal resolve. [[It can
learn from Nordic comprehensive defense concepts]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Factors to consider are creating strong relationships and mutually
beneficial results when engaging local and indigenous communities and
aligning defense investments with climate goals.

The projection of power into the European Arctic is supported by [[a
series of bilateral US security treaties with Denmark, Norway, Sweden
and Finland]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[were
signed]{.underline}]{.mark} on the eve of the publication of the
strategy, [[during 2023 2024. According to these
agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} (similar in content), [[the United
States receives]{.underline}]{.mark} access to military bases on the
territory of these countries and [[the right to deploy
equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}, technology,
[[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} and warehouses there [[at its own
discretion, as well as]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[conduct
exercises]{.underline}]{.mark} in various formats 7 . Thus, the US
military presence [[near the Arctic borders of
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} receives a flexible and guaranteed
mechanism: either [[through NATO **or** through bilateral security
agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} with Arctic states.

[[A serious argument questioning]{.underline}]{.mark} the feasibility of
[[the strategy is the lack of official comments]{.underline}]{.mark} on
the provision of the new strategy [[with the US military
budget]{.underline}]{.mark} 31. The attention and resources of the
Pentagon, as follows from the briefing of US Deputy Secretary of Defense
K. Hicks, are primarily required by Ukraine, the Middle East, and the
Indo-Pacific region. The Norwegian military attaché in the US, O. Hagen,
also noted that [[disputes are possible between the US and its European
allies due to the lack of funding for Arctic policy]{.underline}]{.mark}
32 .
