#### Trump's executive attempts to increase offshore drilling in the Arctic face significant legal obstacles \-- Congressional action necessary

Katie **Shaw** February 12th, **2025** President Biden and Trump's
Offshore Drilling Debate: Expanding or Restricting U.S. Energy
Resources? https://nsglc.olemiss.edu/blog/2025/feb/12/index.html

In response to President Biden's ban, Trump stated on [The Hugh Hewitt
Show](https://hughhewitt.com/president-elect-donald-trump-on-one-big-beautiful-bill)
that Biden's action was "ridiculous" and that he would immediately undo
the ban. On January 20, 2025, President [[Trump followed through by
signing]{.underline}]{.mark} [[[Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/)
14148]{.underline}]{.mark} to lift Biden's ban, [[an action consistent
with his policies to prioritize energy independence and economic growth
through increased fossil fuel production]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The
order]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[attempts to revoke a [March 2023
order](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3896676-biden-to-block-oil-leasing-in-the-arctic-ocean-as-willow-decision-looms/)
to block oil and gas drilling on 2.8 million acres in the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, [[the reversal may face significant
legal obstacles]{.underline}]{.mark}. A 2019 court ruling determined
that the OCSLA does not grant the president the authority to overturn a
previous ban, meaning President [[Trump's attempt to lift the ban would
likely require congressional action.]{.underline}]{.mark} [League of
Conservation Voters v.
Trump](https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/case-documents/2019/20190329_docket-317-cv-00101_order-1.pdf)
at 17--18. The order traces back to Trump's efforts in 2017 to reverse
withdrawals in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean imposed by President Obama.
Ultimately, U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ruled that Obama's
withdrawal of about 120 million acres of waters would remain in effect
unless revoked by Congress. Id. The Ninth Circuit later vacated the
ruling as moot. [League of Conservation Voters v.
Biden](https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/case-documents/2021/20210413_docket-19-35460_order.pdf)
at 4. As a result, [[no direct precedent exists on the president's
authority to reverse offshore land withdrawals under the OSCLA, but
Congress still has the power to modify or reverse these
withdrawals.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 1AC \-\-- Plan

#### Plan: The United States federal government should significantly increase offshore oil and natural gas drilling in the Arctic. 

### 1AC \-\-- Solvency

#### The plan solves -- it expands the capacity for drilling in the Arctic, making it easier, and companies will be motivated

Jennifer A. **Dlouhy**, Bloomberg June 02, **2025** Trump officials move
to repeal Biden-era blocks on Arctic oil drilling
https://worldoil.com/news/2025/6/2/trump-officials-move-to-repeal-biden-era-blocks-on-arctic-oil-drilling/

The action responds to a directive [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} issued
after his inauguration in January, when he [[signed an executive order
compelling a host of policy changes meant to expand oil, natural gas and
mineral development in Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The reserve holds
an estimated 8.7 billion barrels of recoverable
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to a 2017 assessment by the US
Geological Survey. And its production is set to skyrocket, with the
development of recent discoveries. Alaska has forecast that crude
production from the reserve will climb to 139,600 bpd in fiscal 2033, up
from 15,800 bpd in fiscal 2023. [[Trump's measure would repeal a 2024
rule imposed under]{.underline}]{.mark} former President Joe [[Biden,
which designated 13 million acres of the reserve as "special areas,"
limiting future oil and gas leasing]{.underline}]{.mark}, while
maintaining leasing prohibitions on 10.6 million acres of the NPR-A.
[[The rule has complicated future oil drilling and
production]{.underline}]{.mark} in the reserve where companies including
ConocoPhillips, Santos Ltd., Repsol SA and Armstrong Oil & Gas Inc. have
been active. ConocoPhillips is developing its 600-million-barrel Willow
project in the refuge, which is expected to produce first oil in 2029.
\"API applauds the administration for taking action to repeal the
misguided NPR-A rule and fully leverage Alaska's National Petroleum
Reserve as a driver of revenue, economic growth and energy security,\"
said American Petroleum Institute (API) Senior Vice President of Policy,
Economics and Regulatory Affairs Dustin Meyer in reaction to the news.
\"[[Our industry is committed to the safe, responsible development of
Alaska's vast energy resources, and we look forward to
working]{.mark}]{.underline} with Secretary Burgum [[to advance American
energy dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

#### US-led exploration and development of offshore oil and gas in the Arctic is the best option to support safe, responsible, and effective oversight of the region

Andrew **Holland** on Mar 17, **2016** US Withdrawal from Arctic
Drilling Cedes Leadership
https://www.americansecurityproject.org/us-withdrawal-from-arctic-drilling-cedes-leadership/

[[There is a real danger that, if the U.S. is not actively planning for,
and promoting oil and gas drilling in its own waters, it will lose its
ability to influence how these projects move
forward]{.underline}]{.mark}. How to drill safely, sustainably, and
productively in these waters is a tremendous challenge. [[American
government managers]{.underline}]{.mark} at BOEM and safety regulators
at The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) [[have
devised strong oversight regimes for the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and they can help other Arctic nations do the
same]{.underline}]{.mark}. Last summer, I participated in a [U.S. State
Department-sponsored conference in
Reykjavik](https://www.americansecurityproject.org/iceland-like-all-arctic-nations-is-drilling-for-oil/),
Iceland that sought to bring American best-practices to Icelandic
governance. There have been similar events in Greenland and Finland.
However, now that the United States seems to be withdrawing from arctic
drilling, we should be concerned that those invitations will no longer
come. [[Without energy exploration in American Arctic waters, then the
American government would not have the standing to offer technical
assistance and support to governments]{.underline}]{.mark} like Iceland
or Greenland. [[In effect, the American government would cede the field
to Chinese or Russian influence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Each nation has to
decide for itself whether the risks are worth the benefits: most of the
nations of the Arctic have decided to explore for oil. Of course we
should develop alternatives to oil. But, until we can drive our cars,
fly our planes, and operate our ships on something other than petroleum,
every country will seek to exploit their domestic reserves of oil.
[[Americans cannot simply wish away the challenges of oil
drilling]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### 1AC \-\-- Energy Security Advantage

#### Arctic development is inevitable as countries rush to secure resources - plan is key to energy independence, economic growth, and global leadership.

Kati **Capozzi,** opinion contributor - 05/22/**25** 1:30 PM ET Kati
Capozzi serves as the president and CEO of [Alaska
Chamber](https://www.alaskachamber.com/), the state's most diverse
business association, and is a passionate advocate for a healthy
business environment in Alaska. Let Alaska lead: America's energy,
security and Arctic future depend on it
https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/5312086-alaska-energy-security-future/

In his first hours back in office, [President
Trump](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/) signed a series of
[executive
orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-alaskas-extraordinary-resource-potential/)
aimed at unlocking Alaska's resource potential. This signaled to the
world what many Alaskans have long known: [[The road to American
prosperity, security and global leadership runs through the 49th
state]{.underline}]{.mark}. This renewed federal attention is not only
welcome --- it's long overdue. With growing incursions by Russian and
Chinese forces into Alaska's waters and airspace, America's northernmost
state is no longer a distant outpost; [[it is the front line of a new
global contest]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile, the Arctic itself is
changing. Warming oceans are opening new trade routes. Rival nations are
racing to stake claims and build presence. Yet while [[Moscow and
Beijing have poured billions into Arctic infrastructure and military
expansion, the U.S. has been dogged by
underinvestment]{.mark}]{.underline} and, until now, a lack of serious
engagement. Alaska is the game-changer. [[Our vast reserves of oil, gas,
coal, and critical minerals]{.underline}]{.mark} --- including copper
and rare earth elements --- [[are essential to reducing U.S. dependence
on hostile foreign suppliers]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Its Arctic
geography makes it indispensable to our national
defense.]{.underline}]{.mark} And its communities, industries and Alaska
Native leadership are ready to meet this historic moment. That's why
more than 100 of Alaska's business and community leaders representing
oil and gas, mining, fisheries, tourism, forestry, transportation,
construction and Native corporations have come together to deliver a
unified message to Washington: Alaska is poised to deliver on the
promise of [William H.
Seward](https://thehill.com/people/william-h-seward/) when he pressed
the U.S. to purchase the state from Russia in 1867. [[To use the state's
untold resource wealth and strategic advantage for the benefit of the
U.S. Now is the time]{.underline}]{.mark}. We are ready. [[Let us
lead.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### \*\*Energy demand will double by 2030 -- and additional oil and natural gas is necessary. US leadership is necessary to balance the demand for energy with environmental goals

Rebecca **Trieu** Feb. 20, **2025** Congress: Offshore Production
Critical to Energy Security
<https://www.energyindepth.org/congress-offshore-production-critical-to-energy-security/>

During the hearing, Williams Companies' Senior Vice President and
General Counsel, T. Lane Wilson laid the groundwork in his testimony by
pointing out that [[energy demand [is expected to double by
2030](https://www.energyindepth.org/investment-in-natural-gas-essential-to-reduce-grid-strain-from-ai-data-centers/?)]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In this scenario, intermittent solar and wind power will not be able to
generate the required power alone -- meaning [[additional [oil and
natural gas supplies are
critical](https://www.energyindepth.org/report-u-s-natural-gas-is-key-to-reshoring-manufacturing/?154)]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Wilson argued that this trend continues well into the future, [[as AI
and data center expansion could triple energy demand by
2040.]{.underline}]{.mark} Federal lands and waters are one of the
country's most valuable sources of untapped energy resources that could
meet this surging demand. However, under the Biden administration, the
White House
[took](https://www.energyindepth.org/bipartisan-senators-urge-biden-administration-to-withdraw-proposal-to-limit-offshore-production/?154)
[steps](https://www.energyindepth.org/more-bad-broken-records-offshore-permits-hit-19-year-low-under-biden-admin/?154)
to drastically limit oil and natural gas production onshore and
offshore. Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AK) highlighted actions taken by the
Biden administration which lead to the United States currently having
the [lowest scheduled offshore lease
sales](https://www.energyindepth.org/biden-admin-pushes-catastrophic-ban-on-offshore-drilling-leases/?154)
"in a long time," with only has three lease sales planned between 2025
and 2029. Making things worse, in a [parting executive
order](https://www.energyindepth.org/biden-admin-pushes-catastrophic-ban-on-offshore-drilling-leases/?154),
former President Biden banned offshore drilling in over six hundred
acres of the Gulf of Mexico. Of the order, Republicans on the
subcommittee
[wrote](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II06/20250211/117868/HHRG-119-II06-20250211-SD002.pdf):
"The Biden administration's January 6, 2025 withdrawal of 625 million
acres of the OCS---spanning the Atlantic, Pacific, GOA, and northern
Bering Sea---represents one of the most brazen retreats from long-term
American energy security in U.S. history. \[...\] "It betrays workers,
communities, and industries that depend on energy development, all while
emboldening OPEC, Russia, and China to exploit America's self-imposed
weakness." Witnesses also made the point that absent an increase in
domestic energy production, other countries will step in to meet rising
demand. Committee witness Tim Tarpley, President of the Energy Workforce
and Technology Council, pointed to Qatar and Saudi Arabia, major
producers with vast offshore resources, which stand to benefit from
increasing energy demand: "[[Restricting U.S. offshore production just
means that the development will go somewhere else]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The demand will not go away. [[Other countries will]{.underline}]{.mark}
just [[reap the benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}." Witnesses agree:
[[American producers follow the highest standards American offshore
production isn't just key for energy security -- it's also [better for
the
environment](https://www.energyindepth.org/report-u-s-beats-competitors-with-low-carbon-intensity-oil/?154)]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Wilson pointed out that domestic production in the Gulf has a
significantly lower emissions footprint than the global average: "The
emissions' footprint in the Gulf is less than half \[compared to the
global average for deep water fields\] because we don't flare like other
countries do. If we did not produce this energy, China would produce it,
Iran would produce it and Russia would produce it, with much higher
emissions footprint." (emphasis added) This holds true even when
offshore production has increased. Tarpley told the Committee that from
2011 to 2017, Gulf carbon emissions
[decreased](https://www.energyindepth.org/a-maryland-court-ruling-endangers-gulf-oil-production-heres-what-you-need-to-know/?154)
by 60 percent, even as oil production increased by more than 45 percent,
as a result of American producers operating under the [strictest
environmental standards in the
world](https://www.energyindepth.org/hawaii-state-energy-agency-lng-necessary-to-meet-states-renewable-goals/?154).
Even minority witness Peg Howell, Founder of Stop Offshore Drilling in
the Atlantic, recognized that American producers follow the [highest
standards](https://www.energyindepth.org/no-surprise-researcher-behind-controversial-lng-study-again-makes-unfounded-claims/?154)
in the world and that these standards carry over internationally where
American producers operate. Rep. Nicholas Begich (R-AK): "So you believe
that \[American oil companies\] are operating with high quality, high
standards of practices because they are American drilling companies,
even if they are overseas?" Howell: "Most of the offshore drilling that
is done by American oil companies... I've been on some of those rigs
myself in the North Sea... I can say are the same caliber as what's
being drilled in the Gulf of Mexico." Bottom Line: [[Energy demand is
going to continue to grow for decades to come, and choosing American
energy means meeting this demand with the highest technical and
environmental requirements in the world.]{.underline}]{.mark} Congress'
focus on offshore development within its first few weeks could signal a
renewed focus in ensuring the country has a robust offshore leasing
program that contributes to energy security while lowering emissions.

#### Unlocking additional offshore energy sources will increase US security and massively grow the economy -- adding as much as 25 trillion to our GDP.

Dominance: Unlocking America's Oil and Gas Potential through Innovation
and Policy January 20, 2025
https://www.heritage.org/energy/report/time-us-energy-dominance-unlocking-americas-oil-and-gas-potential-through-innovation

To assess the economic effect of capitalizing on the vast oil and gas
supply in the United States, we used the Heritage Energy Model (HEM). In
particular, we performed a simulation comparing current policy under the
Energy Information Administration's (EIA's) current reference case to a
policy assuming that the recoverable shale oil and shale gas are 50
percent higher than under current policy.12 The EIA refers to this
simulation as its high resource case. U.S. petroleum production and
natural gas production in 2016 were about 50 percent higher than the
projection the EIA made for them eight years earlier. In fact, our
assumptions in this study may even be underestimates that do not fully
take into account the potential of ever-improving smart drilling
technologies. Although this simulation is not a specific policy
simulation per se, it nevertheless highlights the effect of [[increasing
domestic oil and gas production,]{.underline}]{.mark} and regulatory
reform could indeed put a 50 percent increase within reach. Altogether,
the model finds that through 2050, doing so [[would result in: An
overall average gain of more than 5.27 million jobs per
year,]{.underline}]{.mark} A peak employment gain of more than 6 million
jobs, [[A total income gain for a family of four of more than \$300,000
with an average annual gain of \$12,418]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and An
aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) gain of more than \$25 trillion
through 2050.]{.underline}]{.mark} Chart 2 provides the model
simulation's predicted impact in terms of employment. As Chart 2 shows,
through 2050, there are tremendous employment gains as a result of
increasing domestic oil and gas production: average employment gains of
more than 4.9 million jobs with a peak employment gain of more than 6
million jobs. The reason for these gains is multifold. First are the
opportunities directly for those working on the fracking---the workers,
engineers, managers, and data scientists associated with the extraction.
Fracking projects also provide opportunities for local businesses,
including hotels, motels, restaurants, and laundromats. [[Most
fundamentally]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, as discussed, [[access to
affordable and reliable energy reduces the cost of doing
business]{.underline}]{.mark}, thereby reducing operational expenses for
businesses, leaving more resources for investing in labor, and more
capital at their disposal. [[Increasing access to affordable energy
increases productivity.]{.mark}]{.underline} That is, the increase in
available energy does not simply increase the number of jobs, it makes
employment across the economy more productive. The result is not just
more workers, but more workers with higher incomes. Chart 3 quantifies
the model simulation results in terms of changes in per capita GDP. As
Chart 3 illustrates, the changes in income for a family of four are
significant: Through 2050, these gains average more than \$12,000
annually, amounting to over \$320,000 for a family of four. [[In terms
of aggregate GDP, the gains are immense, amounting to more than \$1
trillion annually and more than \$25 trillion through
2050]{.underline}]{.mark}. These results are a manifestation of the
vibrant economy that results from tapping the vast U.S. oil and gas
supply.

Various [scholars]{.underline} and institutions [regard global social
instability as the greatest threat]{.underline} facing this decade. [The
catalyst has been postulated to be [a Second]{.mark} Great
[Depression]{.mark} which, in turn, [will have profound
implications]{.mark} for global security and national
integrity]{.underline}. This paper, written from a broad systems
perspective, illustrates how [emerging risks are]{.underline} getting
more complex and [intertwined]{.underline}; blurring boundaries between
the economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal and technological
taxonomy used by the World Economic Forum for its annual global risk
forecasts. [Tight [couplings in]{.mark}]{.underline} our [[global
systems]{.mark} have]{.underline} also [[enabled risks]{.mark} accrued
[in one area to snowball into]{.mark} a [full-blown crisis
elsewhere]{.mark}]{.underline}. The COVID-19 pandemic and its
socioeconomic fallouts exemplify this systemic chain-reaction.
Onceinexorable forces of globalization are rupturing as the current
global system can no longer be sustained due to poor governance and
runaway wealth fractionation. The coronavirus pandemic is also enabling
Big Tech to expropriate the levers of governments and mass
communications worldwide. This paper concludes by highlighting how this
development poses a dilemma for security professionals. Key Words:
Global Systems, Emergence, VUCA, COVID-9, Social Instability, Big Tech,
Great Reset INTRODUCTION The new decade is witnessing rising volatility
across global systems. Pick any random "system" today and chart out its
trajectory: Are our education systems becoming more robust and
affordable? What about food security? Are our healthcare systems
improving? Are our pension systems sound? Wherever one looks, there are
dark clouds gathering on a global horizon marked by volatility,
uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA). But what exactly is a
global system? Our planet itself is an autonomous and selfsustaining
mega-system, marked by periodic cycles and elemental vagaries. Human
activities within however are not system isolates as our
[[banking]{.mark}, utility, [farming, health]{.mark}care [and
retail]{.mark} sectors etc. [are]{.mark} increasingly [entwined]{.mark}.
Risks accrued in one system may cascade into an unforeseen
crisis]{.underline} within and/or without (Choo, Smith & McCusker,
2007). Scholars call this phenomenon "emergence"; one where [the
behaviour of intersecting systems is determined by complex and largely
invisible interactions at the substratum]{.underline} (Goldstein, 1999;
Holland, 1998). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a case in point. While
experts remain divided over the source and morphology of the virus, the
contagion has ramified into a global health crisis and supply chain
nightmare. It is also tilting the geopolitical balance. China is the
largest exporter of intermediate products, and had generated nearly 20%
of global imports in 2015 alone (Cousin, 2020). The pharmaceutical
sector is particularly vulnerable. Nearly "85% of medicines in the U.S.
strategic national stockpile" sources components from China (Owens,
2020). An initial run on respiratory masks has now been eclipsed by
rowdy queues at supermarkets and the bankruptcy of small businesses. The
entire global population -- save for major pockets such as Sweden,
Belarus, Taiwan and Japan -- have been subjected to cyclical lockdowns
and quarantines. Never before in history have humans faced such a
systemic, borderless calamity. COVID-19 represents a classic emergent
crisis that necessitates real-time response and adaptivity in a
real-time world, particularly since the global Just-in-Time (JIT)
production and delivery system serves as both an enabler and vector for
transboundary risks. From a systems thinking perspective, emerging risk
management should therefore address a whole spectrum of activity across
the economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal and technological
(EEGST) taxonomy. Every emerging threat can be slotted into this
taxonomy -- a reason why it is used by the World Economic Forum (WEF)
for its annual global risk exercises (Maavak, 2019a). As traditional
forces of globalization unravel, security professionals should take
cognizance of emerging threats through a systems thinking approach.
METHODOLOGY An EEGST sectional breakdown was adopted to illustrate a
sampling of extreme risks facing the world for the 2020-2030 decade. The
transcendental quality of emerging risks, as outlined on Figure 1,
below, was primarily informed by the following pillars of systems
thinking (Rickards, 2020): • Diminishing diversity (or increasing
homogeneity) of actors in the global system (Boli & Thomas, 1997; Meyer,
2000; Young et al, 2006); • Interconnections in the global system
(Homer-Dixon et al, 2015; Lee & Preston, 2012); • Interactions of
actors, events and components in the global system (Buldyrev et al,
2010; Bashan et al, 2013; Homer-Dixon et al, 2015); and • Adaptive
qualities in particular systems (Bodin & Norberg, 2005; Scheffer et al,
2012) Since scholastic material on this topic remains somewhat inchoate,
this paper buttresses many of its contentions through secondary (i.e.
news/institutional) sources. ECONOMY According to Professor Stanislaw
Drozdz (2018) of the Polish Academy of Sciences, "[a global financial
crash]{.underline} of a previously unprecedented scale is highly
probable" by the mid- 2020s. This [will lead to a trickle-down meltdown,
impacting all areas of human activity]{.underline}. The economist John
Mauldin (2018) similarly warns that the "2020s might be the worst decade
in US history" [and]{.underline} may [lead to a Second Great
Depression]{.underline}. Other forecasts are equally alarming. According
to the International Institute of Finance, global debt may have
surpassed \$255 trillion by 2020 (IIF, 2019). Yet another study revealed
that global debts and liabilities amounted to a staggering \$2.5
quadrillion (Ausman, 2018). The reader should note that these figures
were tabulated before the COVID-19 outbreak. The IMF singles out
widening income inequality as the trigger for the next Great Depression
(Georgieva, 2020). The wealthiest 1% now own more than twice as much
wealth as 6.9 billion people (Coffey et al, 2020) and this chasm is
widening with each passing month. COVID-19 had, in fact, boosted global
billionaire wealth to an unprecedented \$10.2 trillion by July 2020
(UBS-PWC, 2020). Global GDP, worth \$88 trillion in 2019, may have
contracted by 5.2% in 2020 (World Bank, 2020). As the Greek historian
Plutarch warned in the 1st century AD: "An imbalance between rich and
poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics" (Mauldin,
2014). The stability of a society, as Aristotle argued even earlier,
depends on a robust middle element or middle class. At the rate the
global middle class is facing catastrophic debt and unemployment levels,
widespread social disaffection may morph into outright anarchy (Maavak,
2012; DCDC, 2007). [[Economic stressors]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
transcendent VUCA fashion, [may]{.underline} also [[induce]{.mark}
radical [geopolitical realignments]{.mark}. Bullions now carry more
weight than NATO's security guarantees in Eastern Europe]{.underline}.
After Poland repatriated 100 tons of gold from the Bank of England in
2019, Slovakia, Serbia and Hungary quickly followed suit. According to
former Slovak Premier Robert Fico, [this erosion in regional trust was
based on historical precedents]{.underline} -- in particular the 1938
Munich Agreement which ceded Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland to Nazi
Germany. As Fico reiterated (Dudik & Tomek, 2019): "You can hardly trust
even the closest allies after the Munich Agreement... I guarantee that
if something happens, we won't see a single gram of this (offshore-held)
gold. Let's do it (repatriation) as quickly as possible." (Parenthesis
added by author). President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia (a non-NATO
nation) justified his central bank's gold-repatriation program by
hinting at economic headwinds ahead: "We see in which direction the
crisis in the world is moving" (Dudik & Tomek, 2019). Indeed,
[[with]{.mark} two global Titanics -- the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and China]{.underline}]{.mark} -- set
[on a collision course]{.underline} with a quadrillions-denominated
iceberg in the middle, and a viral outbreak on its tip, [the seismic
[ripples will be felt]{.mark} far, wide and for a considerable
period]{.underline}. A reality check is nonetheless needed here: Can
additional bullions realistically circumvallate the economies of 80
million plus peoples in these Eastern European nations, worth a
collective \$1.8 trillion by purchasing power parity? Gold however is a
potent psychological symbol as it represents national sovereignty and
economic reassurance in a potentially hyperinflationary world. The
portents are clear: The current global economic system will be weakened
by rising nationalism and autarkic demands. Much uncertainty remains
ahead. Mauldin (2018) proposes the introduction of Old Testament-style
debt jubilees to facilitate gradual national recoveries. The World
Economic Forum, on the other hand, has long proposed a "Great Reset" by
2030; a socialist utopia where "you'll own nothing and you'll be happy"
(WEF, 2016). In the final analysis, COVID-19 is not the root cause of
the current global economic turmoil; it is merely an accelerant to a
burning house of cards that was left smouldering since the 2008 Great
Recession (Maavak, 2020a). We also see how the four main pillars of
systems thinking (diversity, interconnectivity, interactivity and

[What happens to the environment when our economies implode? [Think
of]{.mark} a [debt-laden workforce at]{.mark} sensitive [nuclear and
chemical plants]{.mark}, along [with a]{.mark} concomitant [surge
in]{.mark} industrial [accidents]{.mark}? Economic
stressors]{.underline}, workforce demoralization and rampant
profiteering -- rather than manmade climate change -- arguably [pose the
biggest threats to the environment]{.underline}. In a WEF report,
Buehler et al (2017) made the following pre-COVID-19 observation: The
ILO estimates that the annual cost to the global economy from accidents
and work-related diseases alone is a staggering \$3 trillion. Moreover,
a recent report suggests the world's 3.2 billion workers are
increasingly unwell, with the vast majority facing significant economic
insecurity: 77% work in part-time, temporary, "vulnerable" or unpaid
jobs. Shouldn't this phenomenon be better categorized as a societal or
economic risk rather than an environmental one? In line with the systems
thinking approach, however, [global risks can no longer be boxed into a
taxonomical silo]{.underline}. Frazzled workforces may precipitate
another Bhopal (1984), Chernobyl (1986), Deepwater Horizon (2010) or
Flint water crisis (2014). These disasters were notably not the result
of manmade climate change. Neither was the Fukushima nuclear disaster
(2011) nor the Indian Ocean tsunami (2004). Indeed, the combustion of a
long-overlooked cargo of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had nearly
levelled the city of Beirut, Lebanon, on Aug 4 2020. The explosion left
204 dead; 7,500 injured; US\$15 billion in property damages; and an
estimated 300,000 people homeless (Urbina, 2020). The environmental
costs have yet to be adequately tabulated. Environmental disasters are
more attributable to Black Swan events, systems breakdowns and corporate
greed rather than to mundane human activity. [Our JIT world aggravates
the cascading potential of risks]{.underline} (Korowicz, 2012).
[Production and delivery delays]{.underline}, caused by the COVID-19
outbreak, [will eventually require industrial
overcompensation]{.underline}. This will further stress senior
executives, workers, machines and a variety of computerized systems. The
trickle-down effects will likely include substandard products,
contaminated food and a general lowering in health and safety standards
(Maavak, 2019a). Unpaid or demoralized sanitation workers may also
resort to indiscriminate waste dumping. Many cities across the United
States (and elsewhere in the world) are no longer recycling wastes due
to prohibitive costs in the global corona-economy (Liacko, 2021). Even
in good times, strict protocols on waste disposals were routinely
ignored. While Sweden championed the global climate change narrative,
its clothing flagship H&M was busy covering up toxic effluences
disgorged by vendors along the Citarum River in Java, Indonesia. As a
result, countless children among 14 million Indonesians straddling the
"world's most polluted river" began to suffer from dermatitis,
intestinal problems, developmental disorders, renal failure, chronic
bronchitis and cancer (DW, 2020). It is also in cauldrons like the
Citarum River where pathogens may mutate with emergent ramifications. On
an equally alarming note, depressed economic conditions have
traditionally provided a waste disposal boon for organized crime
elements. Throughout 1980s, the Calabriabased 'Ndrangheta mafia -- in
collusion with governments in Europe and North America -- began to dump
radioactive wastes along the coast of Somalia. Reeling from pollution
and revenue loss, Somali fisherman eventually resorted to mass piracy
(Knaup, 2008). The coast of Somalia is now a maritime hotspot, and
exemplifies an entwined form of
economic-environmental-geopolitical-societal emergence. In a VUCA world,
indiscriminate waste dumping can unexpectedly morph into a Black Hawk
Down incident. The laws of unintended consequences are governed by
actors, interconnections, interactions and adaptations in a system under
study -- as outlined in the methodology section.
Environmentally-devastating industrial sabotages -- whether by
disgruntled workers, industrial competitors, ideological maniacs or
terrorist groups -- cannot be discounted in a VUCA world. Immiserated
societies, in stark defiance of climate change diktats, may resort to
dirty coal plants and wood stoves for survival. [Interlinked

happens, [how will affected nations react?]{.underline} Will security

Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani might lead to WWIII were grossly
overblown. From a systems perspective, the killing of Soleimani did not
fundamentally change the actor-interconnection-interaction adaptivity
equation in the Middle East. Soleimani was simply a cog who got
replaced.

are]{.mark}]{.underline} directly [[challenging]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[American]{.underline}]{.mark}-led [world [order]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Their goal is clear, and the United States cannot allow them to prevail.
While Russia's disregard for the rule of law and internationally
established boundaries preoccupies the near term, an emerging great
power competition between the West and China looms over Washington's
mid- to long-term foreign policy priorities. Additionally, Iran's malign
influence has led to a resurgence of violence and instability in the
Middle East. Closer to home, socialist and anti-democratic governments
in the Western Hemisphere are again wooing voters with the failed and
discredited policies of yesteryear. As a new geopolitical status quo
emerges, [[the United States will need a secure source of energy. Energy
security]{.underline}]{.mark} can be defined as a country's ability to
ensure the uninterrupted availability of reliable and affordable energy
sources. It [[encompasses]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[stable supply of
energy resources, the resilience of energy infrastructure, and a
country's ability to meet its current and future energy demands while
also dealing with emergencies, natural disasters, and geopolitical
tensions that could disrupt supply]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[A responsible

while providing a realistic pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
This [[will include hydrocarbons]{.underline}]{.mark}, renewables,
nuclear, and lower-emitting energy sources such as geothermal,
hydroelectric, and biofuels. However, [[the glue that binds any stable
energy transition is a key bridge fuel: natural
gas.]{.mark}]{.underline} Liquified natural gas (LNG) is critical to
meet global energy demand and reduce emissions while promoting American
energy security and economic stability worldwide. Yet, the Biden
administration recently announced plans to restrict US natural gas
exports, directly affecting America's key allies. In this environment,
lawmakers should reflect upon their previous missteps before
implementing energy policies that will make the regulatory environment
more unstable and unpredictable. Lessons from the Past and Present

#### There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen." Those words are apocryphally attributed to the Bolshevik revolutionary (and Foreign Affairs reader) Vladimir Lenin, referring to the rapid collapse of tsarist Russia just over 100 years ago. If he had actually said those words, Lenin might have added that [there are]{.underline} also [**decades** when **centuries** happen]{.underline}. [The world is in]{.underline} the midst of [one such decade]{.underline}. As with other historical hinges, the **[danger]{.underline}** today [stems from a]{.underline} sharp [[decline in world order]{.underline}]{.mark}. But more than at any other recent moment, [that decline [threatens to become]{.mark}]{.underline} especially [**[steep]{.mark}**, owing to]{.underline} a confluence of old and new [threats that have begun to intersect at a moment [the United States is ill positioned]{.mark} to contend with them.]{.underline} On the one hand, [the world is witnessing]{.underline} the revival of some of the worst aspects of traditional geopolitics: [**great-power competition**, **imperial ambitions**, fights over resources]{.underline}. Today, [[Russia is headed by a **tyrant**]{.underline}]{.mark}, President Vladimir Putin, [who [longs to re-create]{.mark} a [Russian sphere of influence]{.mark} and]{.underline} perhaps even [a **Russian empire**. Putin is willing to do]{.underline} almost [anything]{.underline} to achieve that goal, and he is able to act as he pleases because internal constraints on his regime have mostly disappeared. Meanwhile, [under]{.underline} President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping, [**China** [has embarked on a quest for]{.mark}]{.underline} regional and potentially [**[global primacy]{.mark}**, putting itself [on a trajectory]{.mark} that will lead [to]{.mark}]{.underline} increased competition or even [[**confrontation** with the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. But that is not all---not by a long shot. [These]{.underline} geopolitical [[risks are colliding with]{.underline}]{.mark} complex [new challenges]{.underline} central to the contemporary era, [such as **[climate]{.mark} change**, **[pandemics]{.mark}**, and **[nuclear prolif]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}. And not surprisingly, the [**diplomatic fallout** from growing rivalries has made it nearly impossible for great powers to work together]{.underline} on regional and international challenges, even when it is in their interest to do so. Further complicating the picture is the reality that [[American]{.mark} democracy and **political [cohesion]{.mark}** [are **at risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} to a degree not seen since the middle of the nineteenth century. [This matters because the United States is not just one country among many: [U.S. leadership has **underpinned**]{.mark} what [order]{.mark} there has been in the world [for the past **75 years**]{.mark} and remains **no less central today**. A United States **riven** internally]{.underline}, however, [will become ever less willing and able to **lead** on the **international stage**]{.underline}. Call it a perfect---or, more accurately, an imperfect---storm. These conditions have set off a vicious circle: [**[heightened]{.mark} geopolitical [competition]{.mark}** [makes it]{.mark}]{.underline} even more [[difficult to produce]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} demanded by new global problems, and the deteriorating international environment further fuels geopolitical tensions---all at a time that the United States is weakened and distracted. The [frightening gap between global challenges and]{.underline} the [world's responses]{.underline}, the [increased [prospects for **major-power wars** in **Europe** and]{.mark} the [**Indo-Pacific**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [growing potential [for **Iran** to cause instability]{.mark} in the **Middle East** have come together [to produce]{.mark} the [**most dangerous moment** since World War II]{.mark}]{.underline}. Call it a perfect---or, more accurately, an imperfect---storm. To warn of danger is not to predict the future. Ideally, things will turn out for the better. But good things rarely happen on their own; to the contrary, left to their own devices, systems deteriorate. [The [task for U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} policymakers, then, [[is to rediscover]{.underline}]{.mark} the principles and practice of [**statecraft**: to **marshal [national power]{.mark}**]{.underline} and collective action [[against]{.mark} the tendency toward **[disorder]{.mark}**. The goal must be to **manage** the **collision** of old geopolitics and new challenges]{.underline}, to act with discipline in what is sought, and to build arrangements or, better yet, institutions where there is sufficient consensus. To do all that, Washington will have to prioritize establishing order over fostering democracy abroad---at the same time as it works to shore up democracy at home.

Hosted by American Affairs, the American Conservation Coalition, and the
Foundation for American Innovation, the [Energy Imperatives
Summit](https://energyimperatives.org/) recognizes that [[America
desperately needs more energy. If we don't significantly increase our
ability to produce and deliver electricity, consumer costs could
skyrocket, and America's hopes of AI dominance will be dead in the
water]{.underline}]{.mark}. For years, policymakers have been lulled
into a false sense of security, failing to invest in new production
capabilities, grid modernization, and regulatory reforms. Since the
beginning of the 21st century, total energy consumption in the U.S.
effectively
[flatlined](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/) and
then minimally declined thanks to changes such as increased energy
efficiency and deindustrialization. But the past is not prologue.
[[Artificial intelligence is set to spike energy demand, and America is
unprepared]{.underline}]{.mark}. A large AI data center can use the same
amount of electricity as [50,000
homes](https://energy.mit.edu/news/the-multi-faceted-challenge-of-powering-ai/).
Today, there are over 5,000 data centers in the U.S., and that number is
rapidly rising. While AI data centers consumed 4% of the nation's
electricity in 2023, they are expected to consume 9% by 2030. By that
same time, such data centers are expected to require up to 5GW of
electricity, [larger than the
output](https://www.thefai.org/posts/building-baseload-reforming-permitting-for-ai-energy-infrastructure)

processing costs and pay a premium.

Jan 16 (Reuters) - [[J.P.Morgan estimated spending on data centers could
contribute between 10-20 basis points to U.S. economic growth in
2025-2026 as technology companies race to benefit from the artificial

which help provide computing power for AI, have surged since OpenAI
launched ChatGPT in 2022, as companies across sectors increasingly shift
their operations to the cloud and integrate AI into their offerings.
Mega-cap cloud companies including Microsoft [(MSFT.O), opens new

[(GOOGL.O), opens new
tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O) have been
heavily spending on AI-related investments. [[The boost to gross

through demand for data center construction,]{.underline}]{.mark}
technology equipment investment, and for additional power generation
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} transmission
[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Wall Street brokerage said in
a note dated Wednesday. [[Spending on data centers likely contributed
0.1%-0.3% to GDP growth in 2024]{.underline}]{.mark}, as per
J.P.Morgan\'s estimates. While the brokerage estimates exclude the costs
of new power generation[[, it projected each 5-10 gigawatt in new
capacity could require \$20 billion in spending, or 7 basis points of
GDP]{.underline}]{.mark}. U.S. power consumption will rise to record
highs in 2025 and 2026, the government\'s Energy Information
Administration said in its Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO) on Tuesday.
There has been help from the political front too, as [President Joe
Biden](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/biden-issue-executive-order-ensure-power-ai-data-centers-2025-01-14/)
signed an executive order on Tuesday to provide federal support to
address massive energy needs for fast-growing advanced AI data centers.
[[\"The data center boom will likely play out for at least a couple more
years given ongoing gains in AI innovation and its potential to deliver
a positive economic impact,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} said J.P.Morgan.
However, the brokerage added, \"Whether that growth continues well into
the second half the decade will then depend, similar to the telecom

https://americanedgeproject.org/why-america-must-win-the-artificial-intelligence-race-and-how-multiple-ai-approaches-are-key/

[[The United States and China are currently locked in a high-stakes
competition for global technology leadership, with artificial
intelligence (AI) at the center]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [[the AI race
is]{.underline}]{.mark} not just another technological competition --
it's [[a contest that will determine whether democratic or authoritarian
values shape our digital future]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The winner of
this race will also earn a decades-long military and economic advantage
and extensive geopolitical influence]{.underline}]{.mark}. As China
aggressively pursues AI dominance, [[America must leverage every tool at
our disposal to maintain our technological
leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} and align around policies that
accelerate innovation. As former Congressman and American Edge Project
Board Member Chris Carney noted in a recent op-ed, America must "focus
on incentivizing innovation and promoting collaboration between the
government and the tech industry. A united front is essential to counter
the cyber threats we face and position the U.S. to lead the way in
developing AI and the next generation of breakthrough technologies. [The
future of American security and economic prosperity depends on
it](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3207890/china-and-ai-are-rapidly-raising-the-cybersecurity-stakes/)."
Let's be clear about what we're facing: China is executing a
comprehensive strategy aimed at economic and national security dominance
over America and the West. Its three-part plan centers on: [Investing
\$1.4
trillion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/china-has-a-new-1-4-trillion-plan-to-overtake-the-u-s-in-tech)

in U.S. tech and trade secrets; and Attempting to increase global
dependency on Chinese technology to gain global economic and
geopolitical leverage. China is also leveraging cyberattacks to steal
American intellectual property and technology capabilities, including in
AI developments. Representative Carney's recent op-ed detailed how
"China's escalating cyber aggression, amplified by rapid advancements in
AI, is dramatically raising the stakes in the global cybersecurity
arena." At a cybersecurity conference, Federal Bureau of Investigations
(FBI) Director Christopher Wray also sounded the alarm on China's
technological theft
[saying](https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-warns-about-china-theft-of-us-ai-technology/7202760.html),
"\[n\]ation-state adversaries, particularly China, pose a significant
threat to American companies and national security by stealing our AI
technology and data to advance their own AI programs and enable foreign
influence campaigns." He
[noted](https://www.reuters.com/world/fbi-chief-says-china-has-bigger-hacking-program-than-competition-combined-2023-09-18/),
"China already has a bigger hacking program than every other major
nation combined,"
[highlighting](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/director-wrays-remarks-at-the-vanderbilt-summit-on-modern-conflict-and-emerging-threats)
how they are hacking every industry "from biotech to aviation, to
advanced technologies like AI, to different forms of healthcare and
agriculture---to steal our intellectual property, technology, and
research." [[AI will have a transformative impact]{.underline}]{.mark},
including in national and economic security, healthcare, energy and
other strategic fields and industries. [[It will matter greatly what set
of values -- democratic or authoritarian -- underpin this
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[We cannot unilaterally cede the
playing field and let China prevail]{.underline}]{.mark}. To maintain
our leadership position in technology generally and AI specifically,
[[we need to ensure domestic companies]{.underline}]{.mark} -- who are
responsive to an American, democratic value system -- [[are
leading]{.underline}]{.mark} in the development of diverse AI
approaches, including both closed- and open-source. This is about
maximizing our innovative potential through every available channel.
[[If we fail to lead]{.underline}]{.mark} in any facets of this critical
and emerging technology, [[we risk handing China an edge that the United
States will likely never recover]{.underline}]{.mark}. U.S. AI
innovation is pivotal to countering China's tech ambitions and
safeguarding U.S. leadership. In September, a Chinese tech firm released
over [100 open-source models in 29
languages](https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/alibaba-cloud-unleashes-over-100-open-source-ai-models/),

also reported that "China is closing the AI gap with the United States"
and unveiling "AI technologies that rival leading American systems."
Developing and deploying U.S. AI can help maintain our influence,
particularly in developing nations across Africa, South America, and
Asia that China is targeting, as well as among [price-sensitive
companies](https://www.csis.org/events/implications-eu-digital-services-act-and-digital-markets-act-us-business)
in Europe that would consider switching to Chinese-made technology if
costs associated with U.S. technology price us out of the marketplace.
Further, the American public understands the importance of Western tech
leadership. A [recent
survey](https://americanedgeproject.org/new-poll-reveals-u-s-european-voters-increasingly-united-against-chinese-russian-technological-threats/)
by the American Edge Project found U.S. and European voters are united
in their concerns over the technological threats posed by China and
Russia, with eight-in-10 wanting Western leaders to cooperate to
leverage technology's economic and national security benefits. This
polling also shows there is agreement that open-source AI strengthens
core values and tech innovations, underscoring the need for cooperation
across the Western alliance to ensure like-minded nations remain the
lead innovators in a diversity of AI models. By encouraging both open-
or closed-source AI models, by partnering with America's private sector
innovators, and coordinating with our overseas allies, the U.S.
government can deploy our soft power or "digital diplomacy" that can
ensure that democratic AI, rather than authoritarian AI, becomes the
global standard. [[The bottom line: This technological race will
determine far more than market dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Technology is not just another sector of our economy -- it's the very
backbone of our collective national security, economic prosperity, and
our values. As China promotes its vision of authoritarian AI, the United
States must present a clear alternative that embodies freedom,
innovation, and opportunity. [[It matters greatly which country builds
the future. Our policymakers must act with urgency now to accelerate AI
innovation so that the world's technological future is American-made
and]{.underline}]{.mark} that the values of freedom, democracy, and
opportunity are embedded into technological landscape of tomorrow.

#### Authoritarian AI leadership locks in extinction and S-risks

Di **Minardi 2020**, Communications Officer at the Georgia Tech School
of Economics and School of History and Sociology; BBC, "The grim fate
that could be 'worse than extinction'," BBC, 10-15-2020,
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201014-totalitarian-world-in-chains-artificial-intelligence

It's called the "world in chains" scenario, where, like the preceding
thought experiment, a global [[**totalitarian** government
uses]{.underline}]{.mark} a novel [[**technology** to lock a majority of
the world into perpetual **suffering**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If it
sounds grim, you'd be right. But is it likely? Researchers and
philosophers are beginning to ponder how it might come about -- and,
more importantly, what we can do to avoid it. Existential risks
([**[x-risks]{.underline}**) [are disastrous because they **lock**
humanity into]{.underline} a [**single fate**, like]{.underline}]{.mark}
the permanent collapse of civilization or the
**[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** of our species. These catastrophes
can have natural causes, like an asteroid impact or a supervolcano, or
be human-made from sources like nuclear war or climate change. Allowing
one to happen would be "an abject end to the human story\" and would let
down the hundreds of generations that came before us, says Haydn
Belfield, academic project manager at the Center for the Study of
Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. Toby Ord, a senior
research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) at Oxford
University, believes that the odds of an existential catastrophe
happening this century from natural causes are less than one in 2,000,
because humans have survived for 2,000 centuries without one. However,
when he adds the probability of human-made disasters, Ord believes the
chances increase to a startling one in six. [[He refers to this century
as "the]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[precipice]{.underline}**" [because
the]{.underline} **[risk]{.underline}**]{.mark} of losing our future
[[ha]{.mark}s **[never been so high]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Researchers
at the Center on Long-Term Risk, a non-profit research institute in
London, have expanded upon x-risks with the
even-[**[more-chilling]{.mark}** prospect of]{.underline} [suffering
risks. These]{.mark} "**[[s-risks]{.underline}]{.mark}**" are defined as
"[[suffering on an astronomical scale]{.underline}]{.mark}, vastly
[**[exceeding]{.mark}** all [suffering that has existed on Earth so
far]{.mark}]{.underline}." In these scenarios, life continues for
billions of people, but the quality is so low and the outlook so bleak
that dying out would be preferable. In short: a future with negative
value is worse than one with no value at all. This is where the "world
in chains" scenario comes in. If a malevolent group or government
suddenly gained world-dominating power through technology, and there was
nothing to stand in its way, it could lead to an extended period of
abject suffering and subjugation. A 2017 report on existential risks
from the Global Priorities Project, in conjunction with FHI and the
Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, warned that "a long future
under a particularly brutal global totalitarian state could arguably be
[[**worse** than]{.mark} complete **[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}".
Singleton hypothesis Though global totalitarianism is still a niche
topic of study, researchers in the field of existential risk are
increasingly turning their attention to its most likely cause:
artificial intelligence. In his "singleton hypothesis", Nick Bostrom,
director at Oxford's FHI, has explained how a global government could
form with AI or other powerful technologies -- and why it might be
impossible to overthrow. He writes that a world with "a single
decision-making agency at the highest level" could occur if that agency
"obtains a decisive lead through a technological breakthrough in
artificial intelligence or molecular nanotechnology". Once in charge, it
would control advances in technology that prevent internal challenges,
like surveillance or autonomous weapons, and, with this monopoly, remain
perpetually stable. If the singleton is totalitarian, life would be
bleak. Even in the countries with the strictest regimes, news leaks in
and out from other countries and people can escape. A global
totalitarian rule would eliminate even these small seeds of hope. To be
worse than extinction, "that would mean [[we feel]{.mark} absolutely
**[no freedom]{.mark}**,]{.underline} no
[**[privacy]{.mark}**,]{.underline} no hope of escaping, no agency to
control our lives at all\", says Tucker Davey, a writer at the Future of
Life Institute in Massachusetts, which focuses on existential risk
research. "In totalitarian regimes of the past, \[there was\] so much
paranoia and psychological suffering because you just have no idea if
you\'re going to get killed for saying the wrong thing," he continues.
"And now imagine that there\'s not even a question, every single thing
you say is being reported and being analysed." "We may not yet have the
technologies to do this," Ord said in a recent interview, "but it looks
like the kinds of technologies we're developing make that easier and
easier. And it seems plausible that this may become possible at some
time in the next 100 years." AI and authoritarianism Though life under a
global totalitarian government is still an unlikely and far-future
scenario, [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} is already enabling
[[authoritarianism]{.underline}]{.mark} in some countries and
strengthening infrastructure that could be seized by an opportunistic
despot in others. "We\'ve seen sort of a reckoning with the shift from
very utopian visions of what technology might bring to much more
sobering realities that are, in some respects, already quite dystopian,"
says Elsa Kania, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for New American
Security, a bipartisan non-profit that develops national security and
defence policies. In the past, surveillance required hundreds of
thousands of people -- one in every 100 citizens in East Germany was an
informant -- but now it can be done by technology. In the United States,
the National Security Agency (NSA) collected hundreds of millions of
American call and text records before they stopped domestic surveillance
in 2019, and there are an estimated four to six million CCTV cameras
across the United Kingdom. Eighteen of the 20 most surveilled cities in
the world are in China, but London is the third. The difference between
them lies less in the tech that the countries employ and more in how
they use it. What if the definition of what is illegal in the US and the
UK expanded to include criticising the government or practising certain
religions? The infrastructure is already in place to enforce it, and AI
-- which the NSA has already begun experimenting with -- would enable
agencies to search through our data faster than ever before. In addition
to enhancing surveillance, AI also underpins the growth of online
misinformation, which is another tool of the authoritarian. AI-powered
deep fakes, which can spread fabricated political messages, and
algorithmic micro-targeting on social media are making propaganda more
persuasive. This undermines our epistemic security -- the ability to
determine what is true and act on it -- that democracies depend on.
"Over the last few years, we\'ve seen the rise of filter bubbles and
people getting shunted by various algorithms into believing various
conspiracy theories, or even if they're not conspiracy theories, into
believing only parts of the truth," says Belfield. "You can imagine
things getting much worse, especially with deep fakes and things like
that, until it\'s increasingly harder for us to, as a society, decide
these are the facts of the matter, this is what we have to do about it,
and then take collective action." Preemptive measures The Malicious Use
of Artificial Intelligence report, written by Belfield and 25 authors
from 14 institutions, forecasts that trends like [these [will
**expand**]{.mark} existing [threats]{.mark}]{.underline} to our
political security and introduce new ones in the coming years. Still,
Belfield says his work makes him hopeful [[and]{.mark} that
**[positive]{.mark} trend[s]{.mark}**[, like]{.mark}]{.underline} more
[[**democratic**]{.underline}]{.mark} discussions [around
**[AI]{.mark}** and actions by policy-makers]{.underline} (for example,
the EU considering pausing facial recognition in public places),
[[keep]{.mark} him **[optimistic]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that we can
avoid catastrophic fates]{.underline}]{.mark}. Davey agrees. "[[We need
to decide **now** what are **acceptable**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
unacceptable [[uses of AI]{.underline}]{.mark}," he says. "And we need
to be careful about letting it control so much of our infrastructure. If
we\'re arming police with facial recognition and the federal government
is collecting all of our data, that\'s a bad start." If you remain
sceptical that AI could offer such power, consider the world before
nuclear weapons. Three years before the first nuclear chain reaction,
even scientists trying to achieve it believed it was unlikely. Humanity,
too, was unprepared for the nuclear breakthrough and teetered on the
brink of "mutually assured destruction" before treaties and agreements
guided the global proliferation of the deadly weapons without an
existential catastrophe. We can do the same with AI, but only if we
combine the lessons of history with the foresight to prepare for this
powerful technology. [[The world may not]{.mark} be able to [stop
totalitarian regimes]{.mark}]{.underline} like the Nazis rising again in
the future -- [[but we can **avoid** handing them]{.underline} the
[**tools** to extend their]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[LNG has emerged as a major U.S. industry in less than a decade and

revenues for domestic businesses]{.underline}]{.mark} since exports
began in 2016. Export revenues from U.S. LNG already exceed those of
U.S. soybeans, are twice that of the nation\'s movie and television

This study\'s forward-looking economic impact analysis will highlight
the direct investment, economic contributions and jobs supported by the
LNG industry, together with the follow-on impacts of the ongoing
investments stimulated across supporting supply chains and the broader
US economy. [[Capturing the \"multiplier effects\" of direct investment
is a critical element of this comprehensive assessment of the LNG
industry's far-reaching contributions to the US
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The more than doubling of US LNG exports
over the next 5 years will have significant and tangible economic
impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}. As LNG exports move from expansion to
stabilization, the focus of private expenditure and the subsequent
economic impacts shift from 70% upfront capital expenditures and 30%
operating expenditures in 2025 to an equilibrium split longer term. The
rising proportion of spending on operations will in turn affect the
nature of the contribution to the US national economy. Because operating
expenditure reflects the ongoing spending needed to run the
infrastructure, jobs related to operations tend to be more durable.
Thus, the increasing share of operational spending brings more long-term
stability to the economic impact of LNG exports. [[As a consequence, by
2040 every million dollars of expenditure will lead to \$1.4 million of
contribution to US GDP and support 9 jobs across the broader national
economy, with the cumulative impact on US GDP approaching \$1.3

[[Asia is the key driver of long-term demand
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}, as LNG is one of key sources of energy
required to meet growing energy requirements across all sectors. [[Asia
accounts for roughly 70% of global LNG demand in
2024]{.underline}]{.mark}, though that share will stagnate as other
importers in the Mideast, Africa and Latin America continue to expand
their share. Mainland China LNG demand rises to 2030, but long-term,
South and Southeast Asia dominate growth. [[Of the top Asian importing
markets, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are entirely dependent on LNG for
gas supplies]{.underline}]{.mark}, which means they will compete
strongly for LNG in periods of demand spikes. They are also willing to
sign long-term contracts based on a basket of indexes to ensure security
of supply and minimize spot-price exposure. [[As a result, Japan and
South Korea, in particular, have considerable volumes of US LNG under
contract]{.underline}]{.mark} and stakes in US LNG exporting facilities
that tends to flow to the contracted country market.

[[East Asia's scarce]{.mark} energy [resources]{.mark}, coupled with the
vast distances that separate the United States and its Indo-Pacific
partners and allies, [will be a]{.mark} consequential---and possibly
**[decisive]{.mark}**---[element in]{.mark} any major [confrontation
between]{.mark} a **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates-[led coalition
and]{.mark} the People's Republic of [China]{.mark} (PRC).]{.underline}
US [[allies and partners]{.underline}]{.mark} [in East Asia
[share]{.mark} a similar energy security challenge: [heavy reliance on
**maritime energy imports**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that [could be]{.mark}
interdicted or **[blocked]{.mark}** by the Chinese navy]{.underline}. In
recent years, the PRC's "Malacca Dilemma"---its vulnerability due to
Beijing's dependence on energy shipments through the Strait of
Malacca---has been the subject of significant attention. However,
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
**[[South Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} even
more [**[dependent on seaborne shipments]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and
their vulnerabilities have received less attention from policymakers.
Indeed, [the Chinese navy recently conducted exercises near Japan's
southwest islands in the Miyako Strait, suggesting that the [PRC might
attempt]{.mark} to impose a **[naval blockade]{.mark}** in the event of
hostilities]{.underline}. [Moreover, the PRC continues to reduce its
exposure to global energy markets by boosting its domestic output of
renewable energy, subsidizing the uptake of electric vehicles, and,
incongruously, expanding its indigenous coal energy capacity. Japan,
South Korea, and Taiwan, on the other hand, lack mainland China's
comparative resource abundance and, accordingly, face more difficult
energy security challenges. [To enhance]{.mark} the [**energy** security
of these US allies]{.mark}]{.underline} and partners in the
Indo-Pacific, [[policymakers must grapple with]{.underline}]{.mark}
artificially suppressed energy prices and [[the]{.mark} [need to avail
the region of **more**]{.mark} liquefied natural [gas]{.mark} (LNG)
**shipped [from the United States]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Gradually
increasing indigenous energy prices (which are often heavily subsidized)
across East Asia would lower overall demand, incentivize regional supply
sources, and significantly strengthen the region's energy resiliency.
Unfortunately, this policy is unlikely to produce results in a rapid
timeframe, and it puts considerable upward pressure on inflation, a net
negative for economic growth as central banks are then forced to tighten
monetary policy in response. Regional policymakers will need to balance
short-term political economy considerations with long-term energy
security risks. There's a simpler and more effective way to strengthen
Indo-Pacific energy security in the near term, however. Purchasing more
US LNG would enhance East Asia's energy security by reinforcing ties
between the region's democracies and the United States. Crucially,
[[deepening transpacific LNG ties would]{.mark} likely [reduce]{.mark}
the probability of **[Chinese aggression,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[underscore the region's importance to various US
constituencies]{.underline}, [[**decrease global emissions**,
and]{.mark} improve urban air quality across the region]{.underline}.
[Strategically, by linking their energy security to the nation with the
world's strongest military, East Asian democracies can also [**enhance
deterrence** vis-à-vis Beijing]{.mark}.]{.underline} Surveying East
Asia's energy security East Asia's energy security landscape reveals
significant challenges for US allies and partners. The PRC is the most
energy-secure economy in the region, by far, while the democracies'
challenges are stark on a comparative and absolute basis. Taiwan, Japan,
and South Korea are almost entirely dependent on seaborne hydrocarbons,
while the PRC is much less reliant on imports, especially seaborne
imports. Even though the PRC is the most energy-secure economy in the
region, it is still taking huge strides to minimize its current reliance
on foreign energy imports. Beijing is deploying massive amounts of solar
energy, onshore and offshore wind, and nuclear energy. China has also
aggressively sought to increase domestic LNG- and electric-powered
vehicle fleets. While mainland China's mass deployment of clean energy
technologies will reduce overall pollution and carbon dioxide emissions,
all things being equal, these effects are somewhat reduced by Beijing
continuing to ramp up its coal power capacity. The clearer benefit that
these measures provide to the PRC is to decrease its reliance on energy
imports. Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, conversely, remain almost
totally dependent on maritime imports for crude oil, natural gas, and
coal. Taiwan's coal dependency is especially striking and worrisome: It
is the world's largest per-capita consumer of coal for the electricity
sector, a peculiar state of affairs given the risk of a potential energy
quarantine or blockade by PRC forces. In the event of a confrontation or
conflict with the PRC, the People's Liberation Army Navy might attempt
to prevent energy supplies from reaching not only Taiwan, but also US
allies South Korea and Japan. At a minimum, an implicit blockade would
impose profound disruptions on these economies. In a worst-case
scenario, it would potentially force US allies and partners to
capitulate to the PRC's will. Sustaining East Asian democracies' energy
security will prove difficult and they cannot eliminate their need for
maritime energy imports. Still, the Unites States and its regional
allies and partners should take appropriate action to manage these
risks. Safeguarding East Asia's energy security by constraining demand
East Asian democracies' energy security is constrained by the region's
economics, politics, geography, and even geology. None of the East Asian
democracies have abundant indigenous energy potential---for either
renewables or hydrocarbons---that can completely satisfy demand, at
least not with today's technology. Given their inability to substitute
imports with indigenous energy production in the foreseeable future,
Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea must reduce overall demand. Gradual,
frequent, and steady increases in electricity and energy prices can help
mitigate energy security vulnerabilities in the East Asian democracies.
Higher energy prices would enhance each economy's energy security by
incentivizing firms and households to limit demand and improve energy
efficiency. Additionally, higher electricity prices would improve the
economics of indigenous electricity generation sources---chiefly for
nuclear energy---but also for other energy sources, including offshore
and onshore wind, as well as solar. Notably, greater adoption of these
resources would lower the region's overall carbon footprint and reduce
pollution, especially in urban areas. Nonetheless, [higher prices would
undeniably introduce challenges]{.mark}. Higher energy prices could
divert manufacturing production to places with lower costs, as
manufacturers might re-site production to other economies with less
expensive electricity or fuel costs. Moreover, higher energy prices
across East Asia would impose pain on the region's energy-intensive
industries and on consumers directly, potentially sparking a political
backlash. Raising energy prices would undoubtedly pose domestic
political risks across East Asia. But the status quo---energy insecurity
and dependency on seaborne imports at risk of interdiction---could
create severe risks for the region's democracies, especially Taiwan. The
region can balance its security and developmental needs, especially over
the near and medium terms, by turning to US LNG. How US LNG can help
[[There would be considerable substantive and political benefits to East
Asian democracies importing more US LNG]{.underline}]{.mark}. Their
reliance on emissions-intensive coal could be mitigated by natural gas,
which has a lower overall carbon footprint. Importantly, the gap between
coal and natural gas emissions intensity may grow if the US natural gas
complex is able to seize carbon reduction technologies, such as carbon
capture and storage and methane abatement. Besides lowering emissions,
[US LNG would enhance these economies' security in two
ways]{.underline}. First, owing to the realities of the United States'
comprehensive national power, the PRC is less likely to interdict
vessels carrying US LNG than it would, say, shipments of Indonesian
coal. [[Tying]{.mark} their [energy security to the United States
would]{.mark} also significantly [bolster]{.mark} East Asian
democracies' [deterrence against potential PRC
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, [[greater commercial
ties]{.mark} with US companies can help to
[reinforce]{.mark}]{.underline} US commitments to the [[East Asian
**democracies**]{.mark}, especially since bilateral trade deficits are
likely to become much more politically sensitive in the years to come.
[An increase in the amount of US LNG that East Asian democracies
purchase over the next half decade is made possible by a rapidly
accelerating buildout in US export capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}. By the
end of 2025, monthly US LNG export capacity is poised to finish at 9.4
million metric tons (Mt), up from 8.2 Mt/month in December 2024, largely
driven by the startup of the Plaquemines facility near New Orleans,
Louisiana. In addition, per Kpler analysis, up to 125 Mt per year of new
export project approvals looks possible under the Trump administration,
which would provide a steady stream of fresh LNG exports through the end
of the decade. Asian democracies also have plenty of space to replace
existing imports with more US LNG. Across Japan, South Korea, and
Taiwan, of the 136 Mt that was imported through 2024, just 14 Mt was
sourced from the United States (11 percent of the total). More US volume
could help to replace LNG arrivals from the likes of Qatar (17.4 Mt),
Russia (7.9 Mt), Indonesia (7.4 Mt), and Malaysia (17.9 Mt), among
others. Additionally, the wealthy Asian democracies, especially Japan
and South Korea, could facilitate coal-to-LNG switching across the
region. The Philippines should also be a strategic priority, as the
country is now home to four new US military sites, is a target of
attempted Chinese coercion, and is suffering from an energy crisis. East
Asian democracies, working with US, Australian, and Qatari LNG
exporters, could ensure that key southeast Asian nations are able to
achieve energy security and urban air quality benefits from LNG. With a
potential quarantine or blockade of Taiwan looming larger every year, it
is essential for the East Asian democracies to mitigate their energy
security vulnerabilities. This process will not happen overnight, nor
will it be easy. It's important to get started as soon as possible with
both efforts: [[Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan
should]{.underline}]{.mark} strengthen themselves by incentivizing
indigenous energy production, and they should also [[import more US LNG
to bolster their strategic relationships]{.underline}]{.mark} with the
United States.

#### US-China war will be nuclear and cause extinction

Max **Boot** 20**23** (Max Boot is a Washington Post columnist and a
senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. A Pulitzer Prize
finalist in biography, April 17 2023, \"In the U.S.-China competition,
the real 'existential' danger is nuclear war\",
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/04/17/china-united-states-nuclear-conflict-danger/)//rohan

I keep thinking about the comment that Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) made
at the first hearing, back on Feb. 28, of the House select committee on
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP): "This is an existential struggle over
what life will look like in the 21st century, and the most fundamental
freedoms are at stake." The committee chairman was right, but not in the
way that he meant. A leading China hawk, Gallagher claimed: "The CCP is
laser-focused on its vision for the future --- a world crowded with
techno-totalitarian surveillance states where human rights are
subordinate to the whims of the party." While it's true that the Chinese
Communist Party has created a system of "techno-totalitarian
surveillance" in China and is happy to sell its surveillance technology
to other countries, there is scant evidence that it is conspiring to
export its system of oppression globally. Gallagher's vision is merely
an update of the old Cold War paranoia about a supposed Soviet plot to
take over the world, which missed the fact that Soviet leaders were
driven primarily by defensive concerns about their own security. But
Gallagher is right that [[the **United** **States** and **China** are
locked in an **existential** **struggle**]{.mark},]{.underline} because
[[this]{.mark}]{.underline} new cold [[war,]{.mark}]{.underline} like
the original Cold War with the Soviet Union[[, has the potential to
**turn** into a n**uclear** **conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is a
danger that China hawks --- and the U.S. public in general --- do not
pay sufficient attention to. President Biden, for example, repeatedly
says that the [[United States will **defend** Taiwan if it's
**attacked**]{.mark}, [without any **mention** of the potential
**consequences** of a **conflict** with **China**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
"It seems odd that war with China over Taiwan seems a comfortable
assumption for so many when the U.S. and NATO remain cautious about
Russia's war in Ukraine precisely because of the perceived risk of
nuclear escalation," John K. Culver, a CIA veteran and former national
intelligence officer for East Asia, told me. Even many worst-case
scenarios about China are too sanguine about the outcome of a conflict.
In March, for example, House Republicans took part in a U.S.-China war
game organized by retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, a senior fellow at
the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. After the exercise was first
reported by my Post colleague Olivier Knox, I reached out to Montgomery
to ask how it unfolded and whether it included a nuclear exchange. He
said, "The war game ended up with China having a lodgment on Taiwan, but
not having defeated the Taiwan Army." The United States suffered
"significant casualties" and Taiwan "awful casualties." Montgomery
explained that the scenario "did not escalate to nuclear, although that
is certainly a possibility in this sort of contingency." The lack of a
nuclear exchange is quite common in U.S.-China war games, at least those
conducted at the unclassified level. (A senior defense official told me
this is no longer the case with top-secret Pentagon war games.) A recent
war game organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS), like the congressional war game, had the United States and its
allies defeating a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Victory came at "high
cost" --- "The United States and its allies lost dozens of ships,
hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of service members" --- but
not at the highest cost: i.e., the destruction of U.S. cities. CSIS
senior adviser Mark F. Cancian told me that, although he would pursue "a
follow-on project that looks at nuclear operations," he wanted to focus
specifically on conventional operations. That's a perfectly legitimate
choice, but it inadvertently risks reinforcing assumptions that a
U.S.-China conflict could avoid nuclear escalation. Even a New York
Times op-ed in February written by an Australian scholar, headlined "A
War With China Would Be Unlike Anything Americans Faced Before," focused
on cyberwarfare and economic warfare --- not nuclear warfare. And yet
China is in the midst of a rapid nuclear buildup. The latest Pentagon
report on Chinese military power projects that its nuclear stockpile
will grow from 400 warheads today to 1,500 warheads by 2035. The report
also warns that, while China nominally adheres to a "no first use"
policy on nuclear weapons, "Beijing probably would ... consider nuclear
use to restore deterrence if a conventional military defeat gravely
threatened PRC survival." Given that a failed invasion of Taiwan could
threaten the CCP's power, it's reasonable to worry that China could up
the ante by going nuclear. [[The risk of nuclear escalation is all the
greater because]{.underline}]{.mark}, as a senior U.S. admiral explained
to me, it would be difficult for the United States to win a war over
Taiwan by attacking only Chinese ships at sea and Chinese aircraft in
the skies. The United States could find itself compelled, as a matter of
military necessity, to attack bases in China. [**[China]{.mark}**, in
turn, [could **strike**]{.mark} U.S. **bases** in **[Japan]{.mark}**,
**[So]{.mark}uth** **[Ko]{.mark}rea,**]{.underline} [[the
**Philippines**]{.mark}, **[Guam]{.mark}**, even [**Hawaii**]{.mark} and
the [**West** **Coast**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Culver, the former
intelligence officer, told me, "Even if Beijing announced that its
retaliatory strikes against Hawaii or the West Coast of the U.S. were
conventionally armed, it would risk immediate U.S. escalation. Can a
U.S. president refuse to launch in the 30 minutes between missile launch
from China and impact in the U.S.?" When two nuclear-armed powers attack
each other's territory, it would be difficult to keep the conflict
contained at a conventional level. Both sides, admittedly, would have an
incentive to avoid "mutual assured destruction," but countries often act
rashly in the heat of battle, particularly after they have suffered
significant casualties and feel the need to ensure that their troops did
not die in vain. For a sense of how destructive [[a war with China
**could** **be**]{.underline}]{.mark}, read "2034: A Novel of the Next
World War" by retired Adm. James Stavridis, a former supreme allied
commander in Europe, and Marine combat veteran Elliot Ackerman. It ends
--- spoiler alert --- with [[**nuclear** **devastation** in both
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}. Stavridis told me: "If the U.S. and
China manage to sleepwalk into a conventional war, [[the chances of it
**escalating** into]{.mark} a [**nuclear** exchange]{.mark} **[are
significant]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Two great powers who face each other
in combat are unlikely to avoid using tactical nuclear weapons, at least
at sea. [[Once that **threshold** is **crossed**]{.mark},]{.underline}
it is but a short step to a much broader nuclear conflict. [[Think 1914

with nuclear weapons? Now [[that's an existential
danger]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is not an argument for kowtowing to
Beijing or abandoning Taiwan. It is, however, a potent warning about the
dangers of blundering into war with China. [[The United States should
continue to support Taiwan and to deter China]{.mark},]{.underline} but
should also keep lines of communication open and avoid needless
provocations such as recognizing Taiwan's independence --- as has been
rashly suggested in the past year by former secretary of state Mike
Pompeo and 19 House members. That's a fast-track to World War III.
Maintaining the fiction that Taiwan is a renegade province of China is a
small price to pay for avoiding nuclear annihilation.

### Drilling key to economy

#### Additional offshore drilling drives economic growth -adding billions to GDP and revenue while supporting high-paying, stable jobs

Energy and Mineral Resources Restoring Energy Dominance: The Path to
Unleashing American Offshore Energy Feb **2025**

[[The offshore oil and gas industry provides high-paying, stable careers
across a wide range of skill levels]{.underline}]{.mark}, from
entry-level laborers to specialized engineers and technicians. With
wages well above the national average[, the sector remains a key source
of economic opportunity]{.mark}, supporting hundreds of thousands of
American workers. [[A strong and predictable offshore leasing program is
essential to maintaining these well-paying jobs]{.underline}]{.mark} and
sustaining a skilled workforce that contributes to U.S. energy security
and economic growth. Looking ahead, annual offshore oil and gas
investment is expected to remain significant, averaging nearly \$30
billion per year5 between 2025 and 2040. Economic analysis by the Energy
& Industrial Advisory Partners suggests that [[adding leasing
opportunities could further boost investment and spending by \$4.8
billion annually, supporting an additional 55,700 jobs and adding \$4.6
billion to U.S. GDP each year. This increased activity could also
generate an additional \$1.7 billion in annual government revenue by
2040,]{.underline}]{.mark} further strengthening federal finances and
the programs that rely on them.

#### Arctic drilling provides significant, long-term economic development including job growth

Finally, [[the economic benefits to the U.S.,]{.underline}]{.mark}
state, and local economies of continued Alaskan development [[would be
significant.]{.underline}]{.mark} Today oil and gas development is one
third of the state of Alaska's economic activity and provides about 90%
of the state's general revenue. The North Slope Borough oil and gas
property taxes have exceeded \$180 million annually since 2000,
representing about 60% of their annual operating budget.9 [[One-third of
Alaska's jobs---127,000--- are oil-related and depend on oil
production]{.underline}]{.mark}.10 (See Figure ES-9.) [[Similarly,
development of Alaska's OCS will increase economic activity and
jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Northern Economics in association with the
University of Alaska-Anchorage assessed that [[OCS development would add
approximately \$145 billion in new payroll for U.S. workers and \$193
billion or more in new local, state, and federal government
revenue]{.underline}]{.mark} combined over 50 years.11 The projected net
revenues to the state of Alaska from OCS development could be about
\$6.6 billion (2007\$). The report goes on to say: Opportunities would
be created throughout the state in both high paying, long-term,
year-round jobs and in seasonal and shortterm jobs. Of the 6,000 oil and
gas sector jobs, about 3,900 could be long-term, yearround jobs[[. It is
estimated that total national annual average employment from OCS
development---including all the direct, indirect, and induced
employment---could be about 35,000 per year on average through
2057]{.underline}]{.mark}, with a peak employment of over 50,000 in
2038. Total wages and salaries associated with OCS development over the
50-year period are estimated to be about \$72 billion (2007\$).

[[Energy is an essential element for economic
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}, the backbone of nations, and a power
source for economies. Thus, ensuring [energy
security](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/sustainable-energy-supply)
is one of the most critical goals for countries seeking sustainable
economic development ([Ang et al.,
2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004474#bb0030);
[Bahgat,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004474#bb0040);
[Le and Nguyen,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004474#bb0270)).
The concept of energy security refers to the ability of an economy to
guarantee the supply of energy in a sustainable and timely manner at an
affordable price without adversely affecting its economic performance
([Bielecki,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004474#bb0080);
[Bompard et al.,

[Loschel et al.,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004474#bb0285)).
Furthermore, [[many studies have identified energy security as one of
the most critical indicators of an economy\'s
stability]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., [Fang et al.,
2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004474#bb0165);
[Khudaykulova et al.,
2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004474#bb0250);
[Prohorovs,
2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004474#bb0380)).
The recent Russian-Ukrainian conflict has affected energy production and
supply, resulting in unprecedented increases in energy prices,
especially in Europe. In addition to a large number of people having
been displaced, the military conflict has also created hyperinflation,
which has contributed to a high level of interpersonal violence and an
increase in the cost of living. Therefore, we are motivated to bring new
theoretical and empirical evidence to study the nexus between energy
security risk and economic stability in an era of surging
[inflation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/inflation)
and wartime effects from a global perspective. In our study, economic
stability is defined as people having access to the services and
resources essential to living a healthy life in good and bad times
(e.g., financial resources, quality food and housing, and employment
that provides a living wage). We employ GDP growth as a measure of
economic stability, as it reflects a country\'s overall economic
performance and is generally associated with the availability of
essential services and resources ([Ahmed et al.,
2023;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004474#bib523)

[Le and Nguyen,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323004474#bb0270)).
Although GDP growth may not capture every aspect of our definition, [[a
steady and positive GDP growth typically indicates increased
productivity, investment, and consumption, which collectively contribute
to improved living conditions, more job opportunities, and higher wages.
These factors ultimately support the economic stability experienced by
the general population.]{.mark}]{.underline} Our study applies
[Keynesian

theory and examines the moderating effects of inflation and war on the
relationship between energy security and economic stability from a
global perspective.

#### Offshore production is key to energy security and economic growth

**API January 2025** Opposes Further Restrictions to Offshore Oil and
Natural Gas Development
https://www.api.org/news-policy-and-issues/news/2025/01/05/api-opposes-further-restrictions-to-offshore-oil-and-natural-gas-development

"American voters sent a clear message in support of domestic energy
development, and yet the current administration is using its final days
in office to cement a record of doing everything possible to restrict
it. [[Congress and the incoming administration should fully leverage the
nation's vast offshore resources as a critical source of affordable
energy, government revenue and stability around the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. We urge policymakers to use every tool at
their disposal to reverse this politically motivated decision and
restore a pro-American energy approach to federal leasing." According to
the U.S. Energy Information Administration[[, U.S. offshore production
accounts for 14% of total U.S. crude oil production, or nearly 2 million
barrels of oil per day. Robust offshore oil and natural gas development
could generate over \$8 billion in additional government revenue by
2040. America's offshore resources are not only significant for our
energy security, but also generate among the [lowest carbon-intensive
barrels](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/how-the-gulf-of-mexico-can-further-the-energy-transition)
produced anywhere in the world. Reversing this politically-motivated
decision should be a top priority for Congress.]{.underline}]{.mark} API
has also [urged the incoming
administration](https://lightsonenergy.org/roadmap/#resources) to draft
a new 5-year offshore leasing program, changing course from the weakest
offshore program in history under the Biden administration.

https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2025/06/04/alaskas_resource_potential_a_tale_of_two_administrations_1114297.html

The return of President Trump has brought a dramatic course correction.
Just this week, his administration announced the repeal of Biden's
restrictions on drilling in the NPR-A, restoring access to vast tracts
of oil-rich federal land. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum correctly
pointed out, "The NPR-A was set aside by Congress for energy production.
We are simply restoring the legal balance intended by our laws." At this
year's Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference, Energy Secretary Chris
Wright reinforced that message: "Alaska's unique position allows it to
lead in both fossil fuel production and renewable energy innovation.
Washington should get out of the way." Governor Dunleavy, who hosted the
conference in Anchorage, made it clear: responsible resource development
is not only possible---it is essential. [[Alaska can be a global leader
in energy]{.underline}]{.mark}, but only if the federal government
treats the state as a partner, not a problem. Real Consequences, Real
Lives This isn't just policy---it's people's lives. [[Alaska's economy
depends on responsible development. Federal restrictions mean fewer
jobs, lower revenue, and more outmigration. They also erode national
energy security]{.underline}]{.mark} at a time when geopolitical
instability makes energy independence more critical than ever. Under
Biden, Alaska was pushed to the sidelines. Under Trump, Alaska is back
in the game. Alaska's future must be built on opportunity, not
obstruction. The Trump administration is empowering Alaska to unlock its
vast resources and reclaim its role in powering America. In contrast,
the Biden administration left a legacy of missed opportunity, misguided
priorities, and economic harm. [[It's time to]{.underline}]{.mark} stop
treating Alaska like a political bargaining chip and [[start treating it
like the energy powerhouse it is. With the right
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}, like that of Governor Dunleavy and
President Trump, [[Alaska can drive America's energy resurgence---and
secure its place at the center of the nation's
future.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The graph below shows monthly U.S. crude oil production (thousands of
barrels per day) since 1920 according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. Between January 1920 and November 1970, U.S. oil
production gradually increased, from 1.097 million barrels per day to a
peak of 10.044 million barrels per day before beginning a gradual
decline in December 1970. After a brief ramp up in the early 1980s, U.S.
oil production gradually and steadily declined from 1986 through 2008[[.
Oil production bottomed out at 3.974 million barrels per day in
September 2008, the lowest monthly production since April
1943]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The longest economic expansion in U.S.
history, however, occurred between June 2009 and February 2020. U.S. oil
production more than doubled]{.underline}]{.mark}, growing from 5.4
million barrels per day in January 2010 to nearly 13 million barrels per
day in December 2019. [[U.S. oil production grew as a result of greater
efficiencies in production and new technologies, such as horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing]{.underline}]{.mark}, which were
utilized in extracting petroleum and gas from shale deposits that were
previously unprofitable. [[The prolonged period of economic expansion
also increased demand for petroleum products.]{.underline}]{.mark}

This paper contributes to the research on the macroeconomic origins of
conflict. [[Based on]{.mark} a [sample of **133**]{.mark}]{.underline}
low and middle-income [**[countries]{.underline}** [over]{.underline}
]{.mark}[a **[30-year period]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it analyses to what
extent [changes in a country's **commodity terms-of-trade**]{.underline}
[(ToT)]{.underline} [can explain an increase in the **incidence** and
**intensity of conflicts**]{.underline} [through their effect on
aggregate income]{.underline}. While the evidence from previous studies
on the link between macroeconomic conditions and conflict is rather
inconclusive, [[we find]{.mark} a **[significant
relationship]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Our baseline model finds that [a
**negative**]{.mark} commodity ToT]{.underline} [**[shock]{.underline}**
[leads to]{.underline} ]{.mark}[an **[increase in]{.mark} the number of
[conflict events]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[fatalities]{.underline}**]{.mark} in our sample. Moreover, [the
effect plays out **over several years**]{.underline} albeit with
decreasing strength after the second year; and its magnitude is twice as
large for Low-Income Countries and Fragile and Conflict-affected States
when compared with the sample average. In addition, our results show
that macroeconomic shocks are creating more violence in countries with
higher inequality and in cases where fiscal policy faces relatively
stronger constraints on financing a response to the initial shock to
incomes. [Our [results are **robust** to]{.mark} a **number of
[plausible variations]{.mark}** in model specification]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} paper's [results]{.underline}, in conjunction with
previous studies that emphasize the economic cost of conflicts,
[[suggest]{.mark} the presence of a **fragility
trap**]{.underline}---[[a **vicious cycle** of **worsening economic
conditions**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[deteriorating
conflicts]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Effective policies]{.underline} and
well-tailored external financial support [could be expected to help
countries address the challenge.]{.underline}

The world suffers from a large number of violent conflicts. According to
the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP
GED), 1 which identifies conflict events as incidences of the use of
armed force by an organized actor against another organized actor, or
against civilians that result in at least one direct death, 17,000
conflicts occurred in 2021. These claimed almost 120,000 deaths. And
while the incidence of conflicts subsided somewhat after the surge
associated with the Arab Spring, their frequency over recent years has
remained almost twice as high as that experienced in the outgoing decade
of the 20th century (Figure 1).

How can [**economic conditions** affect the **likelihood** of
conflict]{.underline}? Since conflicts arise from complex political,
social, and ethnic contexts, singling out an individual determinant
seems infeasible. However, [it is plausible to assume that economic
factors, such as changes in aggregate income levels, would contribute to
the dynamics that foster conflict.]{.underline} For instance, [higher
inflation would reduce purchasing power]{.underline}, thereby
[increasing the inclination of individuals to participate in violence.
Less opportunities for gainful employment or reductions in salaries and
wages may have similar effects]{.underline}. These would be the case
[especially in situations where governments are **lacking the means** to
effectively **mitigate** economic **hardship** as macroeconomic shocks
deplete their fiscal coffers.]{.underline}

Recent years have seen several major economic shocks on a global scale
with a negative effect on output and thus aggregate income, including
the Covid-19 pandemic, an increasing number of severe climate events,
and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Ukraine war has had a particularly
strong impact on households' purchasing power through its effect on
energy, food, and fertilizer prices (Figure 2). Low-Income Countries
(LICs) have been hit the most, as they host sizeable populations of poor
and vulnerable households while their social safety nets tend to remain
underdeveloped (see Rother et al., 2022).

Against the current background of elevated global economic pressures and
a high incidence of conflicts, this paper seeks to contribute to a
better understanding of the causality between the two phenomena. In
particular, we hope that a deeper understanding of the transmission
channels from economic shocks to violence will help policymakers at the
national level and in international institutions with policy
design---aimed at both preventing conflicts in the first place and at
achieving durable exits from the vicious cycle of recurrent conflict and
economic stagnation, which was identified elsewhere as a fragility trap
(see Commission on State Fragility, Growth, and Development, 2018).2

Specifically, we use the broad commodity Terms-of-Trade (ToT) index
compiled by Gruss and Kebhaj (2019) as a source of exogenous income
variation. Based on that index, we employ the local projection method
pioneered by Jorda (2005) to analyze the effects from ToT changes on the
incidence and intensity of violent conflicts, which could show
persistence over several years. Our data on conflicts comes from the
Uppsala Conflict Data Program Georeferenced Events Dataset (UCDP GED)
(Sundberg and Melander, 2013), which defines conflict events as
incidences of the use of armed force by an organized actor against
another organized actor, or against civilians that result in at least
one direct death. In addition, we investigate transmission mechanism
through which macroeconomic shocks affect conflicts by interacting the
ToT shock variable with suitable proxies for the respective channels:

i\. an opportunity cost channel: lower employment or lower pay could
incentivize individuals to participate in non-productive activities such
as violence (e.g., Becker, 1968; Figes, 1996; Weinstein, 2005; Collier
and Hoeffler, 2004). Our modeling captures this channel by the level of
inequality in an economy: the more unequal an economy as measured by the
Gini coefficient, unemployment, and the share of the population affected
by food insecurity, the larger the fraction of poor households with a
low opportunity cost to engage in violent activity.

ii\. a state capacity channel: lower national income leads to lower
government revenue, weakening its capacity to prevent conflict or
mitigate its economic fallout (e.g., Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Besley and
Persson, 2008b, 2010). In our estimations, we proxy state capacity with
the level of fiscal deficits and external debt as a share of GDP.

iii\. a predation channel: higher commodity prices associated with an
increase in income could cause conflict over the distribution of rents
(e.g., Hirshleifer, 1991; Besley and Persson, 2008a; Adhvaryu et al.,
2021). Previous studies often emphasized the importance of this channel
for countries with oil and other natural resources (e.g., Ross, 2004).

The empirical results of our paper can be summarized as follows. First,
[a [negative]{.mark} ToT [shock]{.mark} **significantly
[increases]{.mark}** the [incidence and intensity]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
conflict as measured by the number of conflict events]{.underline}. Our
estimates indicate that a negative shock equivalent to one percent of
GDP leads to an increase of 0.05 conflict events per one million people.
The estimate of 0.05 events per one million people can explain 1.6
percent of the average conflict incidences that countries in our sample
experience. Notably, the explanatory power of ToT shocks is twice as
large for Low-Income Countries (LICs) and Fragile and Conflict-affected
States (FCS). We complement this analysis by employing the number of
fatalities caused by conflict as an alternative measure that tracks
conflict intensity rather than conflict incidence. The respective
results point in the same direction: a negative ToT shock of one point
of GDP is associated with an increase of 0.39 fatalities per one million
people, which explains about 0.75 percent of the average fatality count
that sample countries experience. Second, we find that the impact of a
commodity ToT shock is larger in countries with higher inequality and
limited fiscal capacity. The former effect is consistent with the
opportunity cost channel, whereas the latter supports the state capacity
channel. Looking at the relative explanatory power of various variables
to model fiscal capacity, we find that external debt is more relevant
than fiscal balance and domestic debt. This is consistent with the
criticality of external debt for LICs with limited domestic financing
sources. Third, [we explore **spillover effects**]{.underline} [from ToT
shocks to **conflicts in neighboring countries**]{.underline} [and find
that the **number of [conflict events]{.mark}** []{.mark}increases [in a
**statistically significant way**]{.mark}]{.underline} [within
two]{.underline} to three [years of the initial shock.]{.underline}

**[amplified]{.underline}** [in the near term, with looming concerns
about]{.underline} an **[Economic downturn]{.underline}** (Chapter 1.5),
resurgent risks such as Interstate armed conflict (Chapter 1.4), and
rapidly evolving risks like Misinformation and disinformation (Chapter
1.3). As discussed in last year's Global Risks Report, less predictable
and harder-to-handle [[inflation heightens]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[risk of miscalibration]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of efforts

**[notable]{.underline}** new entrants to the top 10 rankings this year,
with both Inflation (#7) and Economic downturn (#9) featuring in the
two-year time frame (Figure 1.3). Economic risks are prioritized in
particular by public- and private-sector respondents (Figure 1.5).
Geoeconomic confrontation (#14) is a marked absence from the top 10
rankings this year (Figure 1.4) and has decreased in perceived severity
compared to last year's scores. However, like related economic risks, it
features among the top concerns for both public- and private-sector
respondents (at #10 and #11, respectively) as a continuing source of
economic volatility. \[Figures omitted\] Misinformation and
disinformation has risen rapidly in rankings to first place for the
two-year time frame, and the risk is likely to become more acute as
elections in several economies take place this year (Chapter 1.3: False
information). Societal polarization is the third-most severe risk over
the short term, and a consistent concern across nearly all stakeholder
groupings (Figures 1.5 and 1.6). Divisive factors such as political
polarization and economic hardship are diminishing trust and a sense of
shared values. The [erosion of]{.underline} **[social
cohesion]{.underline}** [is leaving]{.underline} **[ample]{.underline}**
[room for new and evolving risks to propagate in turn]{.underline}.
Societal polarization, alongside [[**Economic downturn**,
is]{.underline}]{.mark} seen as one of [the]{.underline} **[[most
central risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**s [in the]{.underline}
**[interconnected]{.underline}** ["risks network", with the]{.underline}
**[greatest potential]{.underline}** [[to trigger]{.underline}]{.mark}
and be influenced by [[other risks]{.underline}]{.mark} (Figure 1.7).
\[Figures omitted\] Interstate armed conflict (#5) rises in the rankings
for the two-year horizon, across nearly all stakeholder groups, except
for government respondents. This divergence may simply reflect different
views around defining conflict: interstate armed conflict in the strict
definition has remained relatively rare thus far, but international
interventions in intrastate conflict are on the rise (Chapter 1.4: Rise
in conflict). Extreme weather events, a persistent concern between last
year and this year, is at #2, Cyber insecurity at #4, Involuntary
migration at #8 and Pollution at #10, rounding out the top 10 concerns
in respondents' risk perceptions through to 2026. Overall, global risks
have lower severity scores compared to last year's results.7 Further
down in the two-year time frame rankings, Critical change to Earth
systems comes in at #11, Debt in 16th place, and Adverse outcomes of AI
technologies and other frontier technologies in 29th and last place,
respectively. The following sections explore some of the most severe
risks that many expect to play out over the next two years, focusing on
three entrants to the top 10 risks list over the short term:
Misinformation and disinformation (#1), Interstate armed conflict (#5)
and Economic downturn (#9). We briefly describe the latest developments
and key drivers for false information, a rise in conflict and economic
uncertainty, and consider their emerging implications and knock-on
effects. False information \[Figure omitted\] Misinformation and
disinformation may radically disrupt electoral processes in several
economies over the next two years. A growing distrust of information, as
well as media and governments as sources, will deepen polarized views --
a vicious cycle that could trigger civil unrest and possibly
confrontation. There is a risk of repression and erosion of rights as
authorities seek to crack down on the proliferation of false information
-- as well as risks arising from inaction. The disruptive capabilities
of manipulated information are rapidly accelerating, as open access to
increasingly sophisticated technologies proliferates and trust in
information and institutions deteriorates. In the next two years, a wide
set of actors will capitalize on the boom in synthetic content,8
amplifying societal divisions, ideological violence and political
repression -- ramifications that will persist far beyond the short term.
Misinformation and disinformation (#1) is a new leader of the top 10
rankings this year. No longer requiring a niche skill set, easy-to-use
interfaces to large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models have
already enabled an explosion in falsified information and so-called
'synthetic' content, from sophisticated voice cloning to counterfeit
websites. To combat growing risks, governments are beginning to roll out
new and evolving regulations to target both hosts and creators of online
disinformation and illegal content.9 Nascent regulation of generative AI
will likely complement these efforts. For example, requirements in China
to watermark AI-generated content may help identify false information,
including unintentional misinformation through AI hallucinated
content.10 Generally however, the speed and effectiveness of regulation
is unlikely to match the pace of development. Synthetic content will
manipulate individuals, damage economies and fracture societies in
numerous ways over the next two years. Falsified information could be
deployed in pursuit of diverse goals, from climate activism to conflict
escalation. New classes of crimes will also proliferate, such as
non-consensual deepfake pornography or stock market manipulation.11
However, even as the insidious spread of misinformation and
disinformation threatens the cohesion of societies, there is a risk that
some governments will act too slowly, facing a trade-off between
preventing misinformation and protecting free speech, while repressive
governments could use enhanced regulatory control to erode human rights.
Mistrust in elections Over the next two years, close to three billion
people will head to the electoral polls across several economies,
including the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Mexico and
Indonesia (Figure 1.9).12 The presence of misinformation and
disinformation in these electoral processes could seriously destabilize
the real and perceived legitimacy of newly elected governments, risking
political unrest, violence and terrorism, and a longer-term erosion of
democratic processes. Recent technological advances have enhanced the
volume, reach and efficacy of falsified information, with flows more
difficult to track, attribute and control. The capacity of social media
companies to ensure platform integrity will likely be overwhelmed in the
face of multiple overlapping campaigns.13 Disinformation will also be
increasingly personalized to its recipients and targeted to specific
groups, such as minority communities, as well as disseminated through
more opaque messaging platforms such as WhatsApp or WeChat.14 The
identification of AI-generated mis- and disinformation in these
campaigns will not be clear-cut. The difference between AI- and
humangenerated content is becoming more difficult to discern, not only
for digitally literate individuals, but also for detection mechanisms.15
Research and development continues at pace, but this area of innovation
is radically underfunded in comparison to the underlying technology.16
Moreover, even if synthetic content is labelled as such,17 these labels
are often digital and not visible to consumers of content or appear as
warnings that still allow the information to spread. Such information
can thus still be emotively powerful, blurring the line between malign
and benign use. For example, an AI-generated campaign video could
influence voters and fuel protests, or in more extreme scenarios, lead
to violence or radicalization, even if it carries a warning by the
platform on which it is shared that it is fabricated content.18 The
implications of these manipulative campaigns could be profound,
threatening democratic processes. If the legitimacy of elections is
questioned, civil confrontation is possible -- and could even expand to
internal conflicts and terrorism, and state collapse in more extreme
cases. Depending on the systemic importance of an economy, there is also
a risk to global trade and financial markets. State-backed campaigns
could deteriorate interstate relations, by way of strengthened sanctions
regimes, cyber offense operations with related spillover risks, and
detention of individuals (including targeting primarily based on
nationality, ethnicity and religion).19 \[Figure omitted\] Societies
divided Misinformation and disinformation and Societal polarization are
seen by GRPS respondents to be the most strongly connected risks in the
network, with the largest potential to amplify each other. Indeed,
polarized societies are more likely to trust information (true or false)
that confirms their beliefs. Given distrust in the government and media
as sources of false information,20 manipulated content may not be needed
-- merely raising a question as to whether it has been fabricated may be
sufficient to achieve relevant objectives. This then sows the seeds for
further polarization. As identified in last year's Global Risks Report
(Chapter 1.2: Societal polarization), the consequences could be vast.
Societies may become polarized not only in their political affiliations,
but also in their perceptions of reality, posing a serious challenge to
social cohesion and even mental health. When emotions and ideologies
overshadow facts, manipulative narratives can infiltrate the public
discourse on issues ranging from public health to social justice and
education to the environment. Falsified information can also fuel
animosity, from bias and discrimination in the workplace to violent
protests, hate crimes and terrorism. Some governments and platforms,
aiming to protect free speech and civil liberties, may fail to act to
effectively curb falsified information and harmful content, making the
definition of "truth" increasingly contentious across societies. State
and non-state actors alike may leverage false information to widen
fractures in societal views, erode public confidence in political
institutions, and threaten national cohesion and coherence. Trust in
specific leaders will confer trust in information, and the authority of
these actors -- from conspiracy theorists, including politicians, and
extremist groups to influencers and business leaders -- could be
amplified as they become arbiters of truth. Defining truth False
information could not only be used as a source of societal disruption,
but also of control, by domestic actors in pursuit of political
agendas.21 Although misinformation and disinformation have long
histories, the erosion of political checks and balances, and growth in
tools that spread and control information, could amplify the efficacy of
domestic disinformation over the next two years.22 Global internet
freedom is already in decline and access to wider sets of information
has dropped in numerous countries.23 Falls in press freedoms in recent
years and a related lack of strong investigative media, are also
significant vulnerabilities that are set to grow.24 Indeed, the
proliferation of misinformation and disinformation may be leveraged to
strengthen digital authoritarianism and the use of technology to control
citizens. Governments themselves will be increasingly in a position to
determine what is true, potentially allowing political parties to
monopolize the public discourse and suppress dissenting voices,
including journalists and opponents.25 Individuals have already been
imprisoned in Belarus and Nicaragua, and killed in Myanmar and Iran, for
online speech.26 \[Figure omitted\] The export of authoritarian digital
norms to a wider set of countries could create a vicious cycle: the risk
of misinformation quickly descends into the widespread control of
information which, in turn, leaves citizens vulnerable to political
repression and domestic disinformation.27 GRPS respondents highlight
strong bilateral relationships between Misinformation and
disinformation, Censorship and surveillance (#21) and the Erosion of
human rights (#15), indicating a higher perceived likelihood of all
three risks occurring together (Figure 1.10). This is a particular
concern in those countries facing upcoming elections, where a crackdown
on real or perceived foreign interference could be used to consolidate
existing control, particularly in flawed democracies or hybrid regimes.
Yet more mature democracies could also be at risk, both from extensive
exercises of government control or due to trade-offs between managing
mis- and disinformation and protecting free speech. In January last
year, Twitter and YouTube agreed to remove links to a BBC documentary in
India.28 In Mexico, civil society has been concerned about the
government\'s approach to fake news and its implications for press
freedom and safety.29 Rise in conflict \[Figure omitted\] [[Escalation

**[security]{.underline}**. Geographic, ideological,

**[trends]{.underline}** [could converge to spark]{.underline} **[new

will]{.underline} **[[step in]{.underline}]{.mark}**to the vacuum,
[potentially]{.underline} [**[eroding]{.underline}**
[guardrails]{.underline}]{.mark} [to conflict containment]{.underline}.
The [world has become]{.underline} **[significantly less]{.underline}**
[peaceful over the past decade]{.underline}, with conflict erupting in
multiple regions last year.30 Active conflicts are at the highest levels
in decades, while related deaths have witnessed a steep increase, nearly
quadrupling over the two-year period from 2020 to 2022 (Figure 1.12),
largely attributable to developments in Ethiopia and Ukraine. While
difficult to attribute to a single cause, **[longer-term
shifts]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} geopolitical power, **[[economic
fragility]{.underline}]{.mark}** and limits to the efficacy and capacity
of international security mechanisms [have]{.underline} all [contributed
to this surge]{.underline}. Interstate armed conflict (#5) is a new
entrant to the top 10 risk rankings this year. Specific [flashpoints
could]{.underline} **[absorb]{.underline}** [focus and split the
resources of major powers]{.underline} over the next two years,
**[degrading]{.underline}** [global security and]{.underline}
**[destabilizing]{.underline}** the global financial system and [supply
chains]{.underline}. Although war between two states in the strict
definition remains relatively rare (Figure 1.12), [this could
[contribute to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[conflict
contagion]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [leading to]{.underline}
**[rapidly]{.underline}** [expanding]{.underline} humanitarian [crises
that overwhelm the capacity to respond]{.underline}. \[Figure omitted\]
High-stakes hotspots Over the next two years, the attention and
resources of global powers are likely to be focused on three hotspots in
particular: the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Gaza conflict and tensions
over Taiwan. [Escalation in]{.underline} **[any]{.underline}** one of
these [hotspots would]{.underline} **[radically disrupt]{.underline}**
global [supply chains]{.underline}, financial markets, [security
dynamics and political stability]{.underline},
**[viscerally]{.underline}** [threatening the]{.underline} sense of
security and safety of individuals **[world]{.underline}**wide. All
three areas stand at a geopolitical crossroads, where major powers have
vested interests: oil and trade routes in the Middle East, stability and
the balance of power in Eastern Europe, and advanced technological
supply chains in East Asia. Each could lead to broader regional
destabilization, directly drawing in major power(s) and escalating the
scale of conflict. All three also directly involve power(s) reckoned to
possess nuclear capabilities. Over the next two years, the war in
Ukraine could sporadically alternate between intensifying and
refreezing. Despite sanctions, Russia has continued to benefit from
energy profits and commodity exports -- and this could increase further
if the conflict in the Middle East widens.31 Pro-Russian or neutral
sentiment in Eastern and Central Europe could soften support from
Ukraine's European allies,32 while support in the United States could
wane under domestic pressures, other international priorities, or under
a new government. Global divisions with respect to the Middle East
conflict may also complicate efforts by Ukraine to maintain unity with
Western allies, while also garnering support from the Global South.33 If
the conflict intensifies, it is still more likely to do so through
conventional rather than nuclear means, but it could also expand to
neighbouring countries. While post-conflict scenarios for both Ukraine
and Russia are difficult to predict, the war could 'refreeze' into a
prolonged, sporadic conflict that could last years or even decades.34
Proximate developments in the Middle East are a source of considerable
uncertainty, risking further indirect or direct confrontation between
global powers. If the Israel-Gaza conflict destabilizes into wider
regional warfare, more extensive intervention by major powers is
possible, including Iran and the West.35 Beyond potentially seismic
shocks to global energy prices and supply chains, escalation could split
the attention and resources of the EU and the United States between
Ukraine and Israel.36 The scale of Gulf countries' or Western
intervention is uncertain; it's likely to continue to be deeply
polarizing domestically and hold significant political sway. Numerous
GRPS respondents also cited Taiwan and disputed territories in East and
South-East Asia as areas of concern. In contrast to Russia, which
doubled its defense spending target to more than \$100 billion in 2023,
and the United States, which allocated over \$113 billion in assistance
relating to the war in Ukraine alone,37 China has largely acted as a
non-interventionist power in both the Ukraine and Middle East conflicts,
avoiding the risk of overstretch.38 While there is no evidence to
suggest that escalation is imminent, [there remains a]{.underline}
**[material]{.underline}** [possibility of]{.underline} **[accidental or
intentional]{.underline}** [outbreak of hostilities, given heightened
activity]{.underline} in the region.39 Conflict contagion As high-stakes
hotspots undermine global security, a [wider set of trends]{.underline}
may [fuel a]{.underline} **[combustible environment]{.underline}** [in
which new and existing hostilities are more likely to
ignite]{.underline}. As conflicts spread, [guardrails to]{.underline}
their **[containment]{.underline}** [are eroding and resolve for
long-term solutions have stalled]{.underline}.40 In parallel,
[the]{.underline} **[internationalization]{.underline}** [of
conflicts]{.underline} by a wider set of alternate powers
[will]{.underline} **[accelerate]{.underline}** 'multipolarity' and [the
risk of]{.underline} **[inadvertent escalation]{.underline}**. First,
[simmering tensions and]{.underline} **[[frozen
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are proximate to existing hotspots
[could [heat up]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [spillover
impacts]{.underline} from a high concentration of conflicts, such as in
Asia and Africa (Figure 1.13), [could range from]{.underline} more
readily available **[arms trafficking]{.underline}** [to
conflict-driven]{.underline} **[migration]{.underline}**. Other [states
could]{.underline} also **[deliberately]{.underline}** [stoke tensions
in neighbouring countries to]{.underline} **[divert
attention]{.underline}** and resources, [through
disinformation]{.underline} campaigns [or the deployment of]{.underline}
state-backed [militia groups]{.underline}, for example. [Frozen
conflicts at risk]{.underline} could [[include]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[**[Balkans]{.mark}**, **Libya**]{.underline}, **[Syria]{.underline}**,
**[[Kashmir]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[Guyana]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[Kurdish region]{.underline}** [[and
**Korea**]{.underline}]{.mark}n peninsula.41 [These risks
are]{.underline} **[well-recognized]{.underline}** by business leaders:
Interstate armed conflict features as a top-five risk in 20 countries
(18%) surveyed in the Forum's Executive Opinion Survey (EOS, see
Appendix C: Executive Opinion Survey: National Risk Perceptions),
including Egypt, Iraq, Kazakhstan and Serbia, and is the top risk in
Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Japan. Second, resource stress,
economic hardship and weakened state capacity will likely grow and, in
turn, fuel conflict.42 There may also be a rise of 'ungoverned
countries', where non-state actors fight for control over large swathes
of territory, or where parties not recognized by the international
system gain full control. For example, resource-rich countries could
become caught in a battleground of proxy warfare between multiple
powers, including neighbouring economies, organized crime networks and
paramilitary groups (Chapter 2.6: Crime wave).43 \[Figure omitted\]
Third, with instant information networks and reinforcing algorithms, the
symbolism of high-stakes hotspots could trigger contagion beyond
conflict geographies. Deeply ingrained ideological grievances are in
some cases driving hostilities, and these divisions are resonating with
communities and political parties elsewhere. This expands beyond
religious and ethnic divisions to broader challenges to systems of
governance. National identities, international law and democratic values
are coming into question, contributing to civil unrest, threatening
human rights, and reigniting violence, including in advanced democracies
and between the Global North and South. North-South rift Dissatisfaction
with the continued political, military and economic dominance of the
Global North is growing, particularly as states in the Global South bear
the brunt of a changing climate, the aftereffects of pandemic-era crises
and geoeconomic rifts between major powers. Historical grievances of
colonialism, combined with more recent ones regarding the costs of food
and fuel, geopolitical alliances, the United Nations and Bretton Woods
systems, and the loss and damage agenda, could accelerate anti-Western
sentiment over the next two years. In conjunction with more thinly
spread resources and tighter economic conditions, military power
projection by the West could fade further, potentially creating power
vacuums in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. France, for
example, has withdrawn troops on request from Mali, Burkina Faso and
Niger over the past two years.44 As the dominance of long-held power
centres wanes, [alternate powers will compete for influence]{.underline}
in interstate and intrastate conflicts, potentially [leading
to]{.underline} **[deadlier, prolonged]{.underline}** proxy [warfare and
overwhelming]{.underline} humanitarian [crises]{.underline}.45 There are
a number of incentives to this involvement, from access to raw
resources, such as minerals and oil, to the protection and promotion of
trade, investment and security interests. Pivotal powers will also
increasingly lend support and resources to garner political allies,
taking advantage of this widening rift between the Global North and the
Global South. As a new set of influences in global affairs takes shape,
political alliances and alignment within the Global South will also
shape the longer-term trajectory of internationalized conflicts. A deep
divide on the international stage could mean that coordinated efforts to
isolate 'rogue' states may be increasingly futile, while international
governance and peacekeeping mechanisms shown to be ineffective at
'policing' conflict could be sidelined. Economic uncertainty \[Figure
omitted\] The near-term outlook remains highly uncertain due to domestic
factors in some of the world\'s largest markets as well as geopolitical
developments. Continued supply-side pressures and demand uncertainty
could contribute to persistent inflation and high interest rates. Small-
and medium-sized companies and heavily indebted countries will be
particularly exposed to slowing growth amid elevated interest rates.
According to one narrative, the global economy has shown surprising
resilience in the face of the most aggressive global tightening of
monetary policy in decades. Despite widespread predictions of a
recession in 2023 (Figure 1.15),46 the perception of a 'softer landing'
appears to be prevailing. Inflation is falling amid tight labour markets
and stronger-than-anticipated consumer spending and growth, particularly
in the United States.47 In another version, persistently elevated
[[inflation]{.underline}]{.mark} in many countries and high interest
rates are [[weigh]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[heavily on economic
growth]{.mark}, particularly in]{.underline} export- and
[manufacturing]{.underline}-led markets. An already visible [economic
[downturn]{.mark} is likely to]{.underline}
**[[spread]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[with]{.mark} a risk
that]{.underline} **[[new]{.underline}]{.mark}** [economic
[shocks]{.mark} would be]{.underline}
**[[unmanageable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in such]{.underline}
**[[fragility]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} **[debt
[passes]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[the [tipping point]{.mark} of
sustainability]{.underline}. \[Figure omitted\] These contrasting
narratives encapsulate the highly uncertain economic outlook. Fears of
an Economic downturn are widespread among private-sector respondents,
featuring as a top-five risk in 102 countries (90%) surveyed in the EOS,
a significant uptick from 2022 (Figure 1.16). A slowdown in global
growth is already occurring, but it is taking place under a different
set of economic parameters than previous cycles, heightening
uncertainty. Over the next two years, there may be a lack of coherence
in forward projections within and between economies, particularly with
respect to inflation, interest rates and growth rates. With contrasting
views about the future, the risk of miscalibration by central banks,
governments and companies will rise accordingly, potentially deepening
and prolonging economic risks. Additionally, continued trade conflicts
and geoeconomic rifts between the United States, European Union and
China add to the significant economic uncertainty ahead. Supply-driven
price pressures Markets are already anticipating interest rate cuts in
key economies in the first half of this year.48 However, there are
several inflationary pressures that may stymie expectations and present
a less-smooth path to inflation targets. If price pressures continue,
central banks could be hesitant to cut rates in response to signals of
weaker growth, resulting in higher-for-longer inflation and interest
rates. Reflecting tighter financial conditions, both headline and core
inflation have dropped in the United States and the Eurozone (Figure
1.17).49 In parallel, there has been a slowdown in economic growth in
key industries and markets. The global economy had been propped up by
continued strength in services throughout 2023, which is now flagging,
while manufacturing has already been in contraction for over a year
(Figure 1.18).50 Economic growth is stagnant in the European Union, at
0.6% last year, with estimates suggesting that the economic powerhouse
of Germany contracted by 0.3% in 2023.51 Profits of the S&P 500,
excluding the 'Magnificent 7' tech stocks, were estimated to contract by
8.6% last year.52 \[Figures omitted\] Yet even as inflation has been
partially tamed through higher interest rates, it has not reached
central bank targets of two percent and there remains a material risk of
largely supply-side price pressures over the next two years. For
example, El Niño-impacts to food production and logistics could drive
inflation and costly disruptions to supply chains. Any amplification of
the Middle East conflict could trigger price spikes in energy and
further disrupt shipping routes, compounding continued impacts from the
war in Ukraine.53 The cost-of-living impact of persistent inflation,
perceived to be declining in 2024, could resurge as the continued impact
of elevated prices persists. A wage-price spiral is still possible, with
EOS respondents anticipating labour shortages in key sectors and
economies over the next two years (Chapter 2.5: End of development?).
Stronger industrial policies and trade controls emanating from advanced
economies, targeting the green transition and advanced technology, could
also remain a persistent inflationary trend over this period.
Uncertainty within global powerhouses The outlooks for the two largest
economies -- China and the United States -- are highly complex, and
these two key sources of uncertainty could lead to unanticipated, and
possibly divergent, implications for the trajectory of the global
economy. China's economy is widely expected to slow this year, with the
weakening of the property market and local and external demand generally
cited as primary causes.54 Despite retaining its 'A1' long-term credit
rating, the outlook for China's government debt was recently downgraded
from 'neutral' to 'negative', reflecting risks relating to 'structurally
and persistently lower medium-term economic growth'.55 Yet investment in
both manufacturing and energy infrastructure have been key drivers of
growth in recent years, replacing lost construction demand to a
degree.56 Although challenges remain, in the absence of further shocks,
there is room for an upside surprise -- local consumption may revive,
growth may be less sluggish and the slowdown shallower than pervasive
market expectations. In addition, in the absence of further geoeconomic
backlash, excess capacity in advanced manufacturing, particularly in
green technologies, could help counteract global price pressures,
lending momentum to the green transition and global demand.57 There is
similar uncertainty in the United States. Some forecasts are already
pricing in up to 2.4% economic growth for 2024, and others predict rate
cuts in the early half of the year.58 Fiscal policy has remained loose
even as monetary policy tightened, with the United States running a
\$1.7 trillion deficit in 2023, effectively doubling the deficit in the
past year alone.59 This could continue to keep demand-driven price
pressures high. The correlation between consumer sentiment and spending
is also adding to uncertainty: economic pessimism may be widespread, but
it is not necessarily dampening demand -- yet.60 On the other hand, debt
servicing hit over \$981 billion in Q3 2023 -- an increase of over \$753
billion compared to the same period in 2022, a sum similar to the
budgetary spend on defense.61 Any fiscal consolidation in the United
States -- or a political stand-off relating to debt loads -- could have
a profound effect on global markets and trade, while any overestimation
of the slowdown could lead to earlier or sharper intervention on
interest rates and re-spark demand-side price pressures. The outcome of
the US presidential elections in November creates additional uncertainty
for the country's economic outlook, depending on the policy choices of
the next government.62 Debt distress Higher interest rates amid slowing
growth will strain debt loads for the public and private sector alike.
The corporate debt default rate remains far lower than peaks hit during
the 2008-09 Global Financial Crisis (Figure 1.19).63 The majority of
corporate debt is also years from maturity. Less than 14% of S&P 500
debt is set to mature in the next two years, with nearly half to mature
after 2030.64 In essence, the world's largest companies will be
effectively insulated from higher interest rates for more than half a
decade. However, small and medium-sized companies, that form the
backbone of many domestic markets, will be particularly sensitive to
slowing economic growth and persistently high interest rates. As
struggling companies cut costs, unemployment may rise, reducing consumer
spending and creating a negative feedback loop that can contribute to a
deeper economic downturn. This could also contribute to heightened
market concentration, as start-ups struggle and larger, more financially
robust corporations consolidate their position, including in the tech
sector (Chapter 2.4: AI in charge). Heavily indebted countries are also
exposed to these economic conditions. The risk of sovereign debt
defaults is rising but notably, even with a strong US dollar, larger
emerging economies such as Mexico and Brazil have largely avoided debt
distress to date.65 This has been attributed to structurally different
conditions in these markets than in the past, including central bank
independence and the accumulation of large foreign-exchange reserves.66
In other parts of the world, like in Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lebanon,
Pakistan, and Tunisia, the risks are much higher. The impacts of tighter
financial conditions will build over time, and pressures on fiscal
balances will rise. Given historically high debt loads, many governments
might be unable or unwilling to help cushion economic impacts to the
same degree as they have in recent years, sharpening the slowdown for
companies and individuals. \[Figure omitted\] Looking ahead These
[results point to a]{.underline} **[global risks

[How]{.underline} these [global risks]{.underline}
**[evolve]{.underline}** [will reflect the]{.underline} global
**[conditions]{.underline}** [that are]{.underline} slowly [taking
shape]{.underline} across multiple spheres: geostrategic, environmental,
demographic and technological. Chapter 2 discusses a [world]{.underline}
that [is being]{.underline} **[stretched]{.underline}** [beyond its
limit, highlighting]{.underline} a series of **[emergent
risks]{.underline}** [that are arising in the context of]{.underline}
these **[structural]{.underline}** [regime shifts]{.underline}. A
multiplicity of futures are conceivable over the next decade. While the
next chapter explores the most concerning potential outcomes, Chapter 3
explores how a more positive path can be shaped through acting today.
\[Endnotes omitted\] Global Risks 2034: Over the limit This chapter
focuses on the longer-term horizon, highlighting risks that may become
the most severe over the next decade. While the short-term risks
landscape described in Chapter 1 may, if not addressed, contribute to
these negative, longer-term outcomes, attention, planning and action
today can still set us on a markedly more positive trajectory. The world
in 2034 The next decade will usher in a period of significant change,
stretching our adaptive capacity to the limit. GRPS respondents are far
less optimistic about the outlook for the world over the longer term
than the short term. As noted in Chapter 1, nearly two-thirds (63%) of
respondents to the GRPS predict a turbulent or stormy outlook, with
upheavals and an elevated risk of global catastrophes at best (Chapter
1, Figure 1.1). Comparing the two- and 10-year time frames reveals a
deteriorating global risks landscape. Thirty-three of the 34 global
risks increase in severity score over the longer-term, reflecting
respondents' concerns about the heightened frequency or intensity of
these risks over the course of the 10-year horizon (Figure 2.1).
Environmental and technological risks are among those expected to
deteriorate the most in severity over this period and dominate the
longer-term global risks landscape. Nearly all environmental risks are
included in the top 10 rankings for the decade ahead (Figure 2.2).
Extreme weather events are anticipated to become even more severe, as
the top ranked risk over the next decade. Mirroring last year's results,
the perceived severity of Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse
worsens the most of all risks, increasing by a full two Likert points,
rising from #20 in the short-term to 3rd place. Critical change to Earth
systems (#2) and Natural resource shortages (#4) are also among those
perceived to materially deteriorate, contributing to their entrance into
the top 10 ranking of risks over the next 10 years, while the related
risk of Involuntary migration rises one place to #7 over the next
decade. Pollution remains in 10th place. In contrast, Non-weather
related natural disasters (#33) falls close to the bottom of rankings
over both time horizons, likely reflecting the nature of such a tail
risk and the often geographically isolated nature of these events.

### Energy security/leadership

#### Offshore drilling secures energy independence and dominance to grow the economy and boost national security

Melisa **Cavcic** Energy dominance mission prompts US to supersede
current offshore oil & gas leasing program [Regulation &

https://www.offshore-energy.biz/energy-dominance-mission-prompts-us-to-supersede-current-offshore-oil-gas-leasing-program/

During the fiscal year 2024 alone, [[production from OCS leases is
perceived to have accounted for approximately 14% of domestic oil
production and 2% of domestic natural gas production, yielding \$7
billion in federal revenues.]{.underline}]{.mark} The OCS is described
as holding vast quantities of undiscovered energy resources, with BOEM's
most recent assessment estimating a mean of 68.79 billion barrels of oil
and 229.03 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Commenting on the action
being taken to supplant the current leasing program, Doug Burgum,
Secretary of the Interior, underscored: "Launching the process to
develop the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Program marks a
decisive step toward securing American Energy Dominance. "Through a
transparent and inclusive public engagement process[[, we are
reinforcing our commitment to responsible offshore energy
development---driving job creation, bolstering economic growth and
strengthening American energy independence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under
President Donald J. Trump's leadership, we are unlocking the full
potential of our offshore resources to benefit the American people for
generations to come." President Trump's Executive Order 14154,
'[Unleashing American
Energy](https://www.offshore-energy.biz/trump-makes-good-on-all-his-energy-promises-golden-us-oil-gas-lng-age-and-offshore-wind-pause-in-effect/),'
is interpreted to underline the national interest in maximizing the use
of what DOI sees as "affordable, reliable domestic energy," establishing
U.S. policy to "encourage energy exploration and production on federal
lands and waters, including the Outer Continental Shelf, to meet the
needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy
leader long into the future." As the Trump administration has reaffirmed
its commitment to offshore energy development, the Department of the
Interior points out that [[energy dominance remains "a cornerstone of
U.S. economic strength and global leadership,"]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by
expanding U.S. offshore capabilities to ensure affordable energy for
consumers, creating high-paying jobs, and reducing dependence on foreign
adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}.

On a related note, the ongoing [[Western decoupling from Chinese supply
chains must accelerate]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Critical facets of
electricity generation, transportation, and national defense simply
cannot rely on the goodwill of the Chinese Communist
Party]{.underline}]{.mark}. Continuing to permit this vulnerability may
well put American national security at serious risk. Conclusion [[Energy
security cannot be divorced from national security]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The two are intimately connected. Compromising one inevitably
compromises the other. If the United States is to avoid Europe's
unfortunate fate, it must work quickly to reduce its dependency on
communist China before the CCP has a chance to exercise its enormous
leverage at the American people's expense. The Biden administration's
war on domestic energy producers must come to an end. Not only has
targeting the industry with burdensome regulations and rhetorical
assaults helped contribute to [[the current energy
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it [[may]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[drive the United States back into dependence on foreign
imports.]{.underline}]{.mark} The shale revolution made the United
States energy independent, but the federal government must get out of
the business of picking winners and losers in energy, must stop
retarding [[investment in oil and natural gas]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
must allow market forces to [[drive production]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Otherwise, domestic producers of natural gas and oil will scale-down
their operations, driving up prices even further and potentially
compromising American foreign policy goals as the United States is
forced to seek out and secure foreign energy supplies.

[[International events have brought into acute focus the intrinsic

undermined an American strategic asset---abundant energy
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Economic growth and prosperity will
need affordable energy,]{.mark}]{.underline} even as remarkable
improvements in technology and energy efficiency occur. National
security requires secure access to multiple energy sources and raw
materials---in particular[[, the United States needs these resources to
project power globally to protect US and allied
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}. Market access to the quantities and
types of energy, when and where needed, along with the security and
resiliency of energy systems require thoughtful and sustained long-term
capital investments in production, distribution infrastructure, storage,
and research and development---all of which require a predictable and
stable policy environment.

Meanwhile, [[while the U.S. has delayed and slow-walked the full
development of our offshore resources]{.underline}]{.mark} over the past
four years, [[our competitors]{.underline}]{.mark} abroad [[have moved
forward rapidly]{.underline}]{.mark} on the development of their
offshore resources. One of the global drivers of global offshore
expansion is the Middle East where offshore upstream spending in the
region has surpassed all others. Mammoth projects in Saudi Arabia, Qatar
and the UAE are underway. According to Rystad, the area's offshore
spending continues to grow from \$33 billion 2023 to \$41 billion in
2025. [[These countries are tapping into their vast offshore resources
to meet rising global oil demand, backed by the necessary capital and
infrastructure to outpace other producers. Why is America not doing the
same thing]{.underline}]{.mark}? In South America, Brazil has sold
billions of dollars in offshore leases, attracting major energy
investments and making it the second-largest offshore producer.
Brazilian upstream spending is projected to approached \$23 billion in
2023, with Guyana investments totaling \$7 billion7. Mexico has invested
\$7.3 billion. Guyana\'s deepwater developments have positioned it as
one of the fastest-growing oil producers. [[European countries like
Norway have committed to increasing exploration in the North Sea and
maintaining a stable and investor-friendly leasing
regime.]{.underline}]{.mark} Investments in the North Sea from the UK
and Norway have also risen recently. UK offshore spending jumped 30% to
\$7 billion in 2024, while Norwegian investments hit \$21.4 billion in
2023, an increase of 22% over 20228.

#### Energy security is critical to maintain US hegemony

Policy Could Strengthen International Security

America faces significant geopolitical risk across multiple theaters of
operation. With the post--Cold War peace dividend depleted, today's
multipolar political alignment reflects an instability not seen in
nearly 100 years. [[Russia, Iran, and China are directly challenging the
American-led world order]{.underline}]{.mark}. Their goal is clear, and
the United States cannot allow them to prevail. While Russia's disregard
for the rule of law and internationally established boundaries
preoccupies the near term, an emerging great power competition between
the West and China looms over Washington's mid- to long-term foreign
policy priorities. Additionally, Iran's malign influence has led to a
resurgence of violence and instability in the Middle East. Closer to
home, socialist and anti-democratic governments in the Western
Hemisphere are again wooing voters with the failed and discredited
policies of yesteryear. [[As a new geopolitical status quo emerges, the
United States will need a secure source of energy. Energy security can
be defined as a country's ability to ensure the uninterrupted
availability of reliable and affordable energy
sources]{.underline}]{.mark}. It encompasses the stable supply of energy
resources, the resilience of energy infrastructure, and a country's
ability to meet its current and future energy demands while also dealing
with emergencies, natural disasters, and geopolitical tensions that
could disrupt supply.

#### Energy independence is critical to national security

to Running on Empty: Lessons from American Energy Policy in War and
Peace **2023**

Still, Americans did learn one valuable lesson from the traumas of the
1973 oil crisis and Arab oil embargo: [[energy independence cannot be
taken for granted]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It requires constant
effort]{.underline}]{.mark} and political will, particularly in the face
of those who oppose energy independence for a variety of ideological and
self-interested reasons. [[Energy independence also requires enlisting
the experience and expertise of the domestic energy
industry.]{.underline}]{.mark} The fact that Big Oil came to be seen as
the problem, rather than the solution, to America's energy crisis was
due to many factors---some of them self-inflicted by the industry
itself. But surrendering energy independence inflicts a far greater cost
on the nation than any so-called windfall profits that energy producers
enjoyed, and not just on the United States. By 1975 the world was
experiencing the worst recession since the Great Depression of the
1930s.59 This was due in major part to OPEC's pricing policy, which had
driven oil from \$2 a barrel to \$11 a barrel less than a year later.
Unlike during World War II, America was not in a position to offset
disasters imposed by others with its own energy output. Today,
fortunately, the United States finds itself once again in the position
of being the world's biggest oil producer, although it is unclear how
long it will retain that status. The more recent rise of dependence on
foreign sources of oil, including from countries like Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela, is troubling. In many ways, however, [[the US is poised to
shape the future of the world once again, with its ability to produce
and export natural gas as well as oil at record
levels]{.underline}]{.mark}---and to restart the world's use of nuclear
energy on a new, safer, and more innovative basis. Whether we do so will
depend on many factors--- some political and cultural, others economic
and technological. Nonetheless, we can learn from the example of PAW's
approach to energy during World War II, a powerful formula for success
on both the economic and national security fronts. The example of the
1970s, by contrast, illustrates what happens if we do not. 30

[[Energy production has long been the backbone of the United States\'
national security]{.underline}]{.mark}. Maintaining [[energy security
requires long-term investments and commitments to developing reliable
energy sources like oil and gas]{.underline}]{.mark}. Unfortunately, the
United States has not fully taken advantage of the opportunity for
energy dominance. [[The past four years have seen
opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark} squandered and [[put on
hold]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Biden Administration\'s ill-advised LNG
permitting "pause" is an example of this. [[Instead of fully embracing a
robust domestic LNG industry]{.underline}]{.mark}, the pre

industry and create doubt and uncertainty among our allies and industry.

joint command-and-control concept November 12 **2024** "Considering
Global War: A Strategy for Countering Revisionist Powers,"
<https://cimsec.org/considering-global-war-a-strategy-for-countering-revisionist-powers/>

Zoom out and look beyond the operational outlooks to consider strategy.
Any future conflict with the People's Republic of China (PRC) begun over
an invasion of Taiwan is destined to end up being about more than just
the fate of Taiwan. The stakes are much higher than the fate of Taiwan
alone. A number of articles and studies have concluded that the best,
and perhaps only way to prevail against an invasion of Taiwan is to
rapidly defeat and destroy the invasion force itself through a denial
strategy.1 These arguments have reviewed the possibilities and
implications of horizontal escalation, broadening the war to regions
outside of Taiwan, and carefully studied slower more gradual responses
such as blockades and sanctions. All have concluded that neither
horizontal escalation nor gradual or distant approaches are likely to
prevent a successful lodgment of PRC forces on Taiwan, making a PRC
victory probable. As accurate as these studies and proposed strategies
may be, they have erred from the very start by beginning with the
premise that the defense of Taiwan itself is the highest strategic goal
should war with the PRC break out. The denial strategy advocates
internalize that a high-intensity limited war fought between the US and
PRC is possible, with options for off-ramps from conflict easily defined
by either a quick US victory by preventing the initial invasion, or a
quick PRC victory by achieving a first successful lodgment and
occupation. A more likely scenario, however, is that if large-scale open
conflict between the US and the PRC has been initiated, the struggle to
defend Taiwan would be better understood as a single named operation in
a series of ensuing battles that will almost surely rage through
protraction and across theaters regardless of the outcome on the beaches
in Taiwan. Neither PRC occupation nor US victory in preventing a
successful amphibious landing would present any realistic offramp for
cessation of hostilities. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has
repeatedly staked its legitimacy on bringing Taiwan to heel.2 Once
forces and the reputation of the PRC were committed to combat, CCP
leadership would be bound to continue hostilities for many of the same
reasons that Russia's future and fate are tied to Ukraine, except with
much higher political and military stakes and much greater depth of
resources and social will to continue.3 Even without the strong
political, social, and psychological requirements to sustain and
prevail, given the PRC's massive industrial advantage, it would have
many rational military incentives to pursue protraction against the
United States and hunker down to achieve its objective. Conversely, if
Taiwan were lost, the United States would also have little incentive to
accept the outcome and work towards some new normalized world order.
Even less so if it had lost considerable numbers of servicemembers and
forces in the process. Certainly, at some level of loss, it could become
politically impossible for either side to disengage, and that level may
be a single aircraft carrier, or even a single destroyer.4 It is
challenging to reach the conclusion that after a violent clash and
initial outcome on Taiwan that broader war could be quickly terminated.
[[War between the PRC and US could be as catastrophic as that between
great powers during the world wars and would carry the nuclear dangers
of the Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}. The stakes of such a conflict
would also be broadly similar to both of these historical analogies, the
legitimacy of the global order and the future direction of the world. If
a future war over an invasion of Taiwan only signals the opening salvos
of a broader conflict for global leadership and order, responses to such
an invasion must be understood in that context. How might such a global
conflict unfold? How should the US respond to a prolonged struggle in
defense of the current rules-based order, and what roles do US allies
and partners play in such a conflict? And, if such a future is on the
horizon, what should the US and its coalition of like-minded partners
and allies be doing now to prevent or prepare for it? Who is likely to
be involved and how might such a conflict play out? A theory of the
conflict should be developed before proposing the way ahead. If the US
is prepared to commit huge numbers of forces and resources to defend
Taiwan in a high-stakes decisive battle, it must also be cognitively
prepared for the possibility of escalation up to and including total war
and widespread mobilization of populations and industrial capacity.
Committing entire fleets to operations that risk the loss of tens of
thousands of servicemembers and perhaps dozens of warships and hundreds
of aircraft over a short period by either the US or PRC (or, more
likely, both) risks enormous potential to fast-track uncontrolled
escalation. As unlikely as a controlled decisive battle scenario is, a
war geographically focused exclusively on Taiwan itself also seems less
likely. The current size and capability of both the PRC and US military
eliminates the possibility of a single knock-out strike by either side.
Whether the PRC strikes US forces first in a Pearl-Harbor redux, or
endures the first phase of a US-led denial strategy before openly
targeting US forces and allies, both sides would still maintain a
massive conventional capability for military response. There is little
compelling reason to assume that even after an initial defeat in the
Taiwan Strait that the PRC would not open large-scale counteroffensive
campaigns that could include land assaults against places that enabled a
US response, including parts of the Philippines and Ryukyu Islands of
Japan and certainly involve subsequent attempts on Taiwan.5 Such actions
would have immediate implications for a rapid denial strategy and likely
cause shifts in political and military priorities from the very
beginning. The potential scale of the conflict would likely continue to
grow. Outside of the immediate region, [[increasing cooperation and
broadly aligning geopolitical objectives between the PRC, Russia, North
Korea, and Iran point to the potential for a
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} that becomes more coordinated than
opportunistic and rapidly expands to threaten US interests globally.6 In
what has been called the "axis of ill will," despite their differences
in priorities and desired endstates, many signs point to increased
cooperation and belligerence from these revisionist actors, not less.7
In Ukraine, the Red Sea, and the Levant, the world is getting a sense of
what this cooperation might look like, albeit at a lower intensity than
is likely if open conflict breaks out between the PRC and US.8 Planners
and strategists should fully expect support and varying levels of
involvement from each of these belligerents should conflict initiate
over Taiwan. [[Across the globe, direct, indirect, and opportunistic
support will confront the US and its allies in every theater.
Large-scale conflict between the US and PRC would provide the pretext
and opportunity for Russia to expand its
belligerence]{.underline}]{.mark} to smaller or more vulnerable nations,
and for Iran to attempt to further regional dominance. The Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) may be sufficiently deterred by a
mutually assured devastation from an outright invasion of the Republic
of Korea (ROK). But they should be expected to increase their militancy
to tie down ROK support to the US and provide their military support and
resources to the PRC, Russia, and Iran at a much larger scale than they
have already begun.9 The axis of ill-will would be incentivized to take
advantage of the opportunity to harm the US in any way that presents
itself. Russian submarines could be hunting US and allied ships in the
Atlantic and Pacific while maintaining they were PRC submarines, or
Iranian forces dramatically increasing missile and drone attacks against
US and allied forces and interests throughout the Middle East. [[With
increasing rapidity and intensity, military actions and maligned
activity would threaten nations across Europe, the Middle East, and
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Simultaneously, [[irregular and cyber warfare
from each revisionist belligerent nation might target
western]{.underline}]{.mark} financial, utility, and communications
[[networks. Large swaths of the global commons]{.underline}]{.mark}
would be at risk for declared no-fly and maritime exclusion zones --
[[all under constant threat]{.underline}]{.mark}. Maritime shipping and
global air travel would be severely impacted and, in some cases,
paralyzed. Economies and populations would be held at risk, and
irreversibly impacted. Even at the lowest levels of cooperation and
intensity, the US and US-led coalition would be forced to respond to
these actions simultaneously. Defending shipping, trade, travel,
networks, utility grids, and borders simultaneously, those defending the
rules-based order would be hard pressed to also mount sustained
large-scale counter assaults focused exclusively on Taiwan. US military
support and resources would be in even greater demand to defend the
homeland and territories as well as that of allies across the globe,
even as they are most urgently needed in mass in the Pacific. Away from
the front lines and missile strikes, a rapid partial decoupling of
western economies from China would likely follow any large-scale
military conflict and be damaging for both sides. In the economic
warfare domain of the conflict, western nations might fare worse in the
short run as the PRC has been diligently working to insulate itself from
current levers of power, while western nations have done relatively
little to de-risk their own economies from reliance on the PRC.10 The
economic fallout that is likely to result following a massive military
campaign itself could be devastating if full decoupling were to occur.11
In most likely scenarios involving open hostilities between the US and
PRC, one thing is almost certain, the status quo ante bellum will not
return. While regime change or total victory are far outside the scope
of any war involving major nuclear powers, cessation of conflict by
either grinding protraction or reasoned detente will still leave a world
forever changed. Even in the best-case scenarios that do not involve
total war or nuclear exchanges, once large-scale open conflict has
commenced the most likely conclusion will be a perpetual state of lower
end conflict with occasional high-intensity flare-ups until significant
leadership or political changes occurred in either the PRC or the west.
If the US was substantially damaged through such a conflict, a new era
of global instability, violence, and balkanization would likely take
hold, as those no longer restrained by American security guarantees take
advantage of a more permissive global environment. How can the US
respond and what roles will allies and partners play? A strategy that
emphasizes speed and large-scale force-on-force actions should be
considered the least preferable. Such a strategy risks more
unpredictable outcomes, considerably less opportunities to politically
message and manage escalation, and is simultaneously far less likely to
receive in-kind support from most US allies. Additionally, if the US
were to lose or even draw such a large-scale high-stakes engagement, it
would have the deleterious effect of leaving allies and partners more
vulnerable to follow-on aggression globally. Assuming deterrence has
failed, the US-led coalition should instead focus on building responses
designed to degrade and deny the long-term strategic objectives of the
revisionist coalition. The range of response options should allow the US
to buy time and pursue alternate outcomes while broadly shoring up and
defending the global order -- directly countering the ultimate strategic
objectives of the revisionist block. Relying on proxies (namely the
Taiwanese military or remnants of that military should the main force be
defeated), non-attributional and irregular responses across all domains,
and political and economic pressure at the outset of conflict would
allow the US to also posture and provide military resources globally.
Escort duties, air defense, forward presence, and some limited
conventional responses will be required across strategically significant
regions and in support of allies. While countering and blocking
aggression globally, [[US aims should be focused on draining revisionist
powers of resources, will, legitimacy, and support. The US will need to
assume the leading role of a global counter-revisionist response that
stitches together allies and partners, protects and reinforces the
global economy, and reduces the military and economic capabilities of
adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} in ways that do not threaten
existential escalation. [[This US-led effort must out-compete the PRC
for any future global leadership role and win the narrative that will
define the global order]{.underline}]{.mark}. When required,
counter-strikes and coordinated offensive action across all domains
(including cyber) should be layered with special operations actions,
arming and funding proxies and resistance groups, intense lawfare,
economic warfare, and the building and strengthening of broadened
NATO-like alliances with committed global partners. With few notable
exceptions, most US allies are in a better position to contribute to
this style and intensity of conflict than large-scale conventional
modern warfare. An attempted invasion or strangulation of Taiwan could
either serve as the rallying point to dramatically strengthen the
resolve of a new coalition of allies and partners steeled to resist the
PRC and autocratic and totalitarian regimes, or as the opening stages of
an even darker chapter of global disorder and destruction. [[What should
the US be doing now? The most urgent effort the US should be undertaking
is revitalizing its leadership role and strengthening alliances and
relationships globally.]{.underline}]{.mark} At home and abroad, [[the
US should be]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[clearly articulating the stakes
and making the case for why the current rules-based order is worth
defending]{.underline}]{.mark}. The most pressing question that should
be asked is how to better compete and win without widescale conflict,
and how to design and inspire a deterrence strategy that is truly
whole-of-government and coordinated with allies and partners to resist
the revisionist order envisioned by rivals.12 The defense of Taiwan is
only one component of an effort that requires Cold War-like mobilization
of governments, economies, and militaries with shared values and a
vision of the future that is not dominated by oppressive authoritarian
regimes. While it is true the US and the west more broadly are
increasingly engaging and challenging the PRC across the diplomatic,
information, military, and economic spectrum, it does not appear
well-coordinated and does not seem to have clear leadership. This is
visible even within the Department of Defense where the services can be
readily seen pursuing different priorities, objectives, and theories of
competition and victory, even while congressional reports implore a
comprehensive strategic posture.13 The confused response levied against
the PRC for activities in the South China Sea targeting the Philippines
and the Second Thomas Shoal provide a pointed example of how far [[the
US still has to]{.underline}]{.mark} go to [[mount a unified
counter-response to the revisionist deconstruction of the global
order.]{.underline}]{.mark}14 The US can and should lead a strengthened
diplomatic, economic, and legal effort, bolstered by meaningful
multi-lateral non-military response options, to rally the rest of the
world against PRC actions and behaviors. There is a lot of distance
between holding the line or pushing back against PRC malign and illegal
activity in the global commons on one hand and preparing the US military
for massive kinetic response options on the other. If the US is unable
or unwilling to do the former, the latter should not be seriously
considered. Furthermore, the overarching strategic objective cannot be
simply to deny offensive action across the Taiwan Strait. Developing a
force focused on a specific operational outcome may be as likely to
achieve that objective as it is to become the Maginot Line of the modern
era. Making matters worse, such a narrowly-focused strategy could also
heighten the prospect of broader deterrence failure in the first
place.15 [[The U.S. has already moved into an era beyond straightforward
competition for global order. The revisionist challengers have signaled
they intend to use violence and military strength rather than economics,
influence, and soft power to usher this change.]{.underline}]{.mark}16
Recognizing this fact, [[those committed to the defense of the current
global order must prepare.]{.underline}]{.mark} A denial strategy
focused exclusively on Taiwan is not a true strategy but rather a
subsidiary campaign objective. Zoom out and assess the broader
implications of countering destructive revisionist powers. [[Western
aligned nations must begin expanding military power and cooperation
immediately and address the dilemmas that define effective force design
and deterrence posturing globally.]{.underline}]{.mark}17 NATO and new
NATO-like alliances of like-minded nations must be developed,
strengthened and postured everywhere to defend the global commons,
protect our way of life, and defend our shared values. [[The US
certainly needs more ships, aircraft, and missiles, but it also needs to
articulate the stakes, prepare economies and people, and engage across
every domain to counter and out-compete revisionist
nations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**Retrenchment isn't an option -- only maintaining dominance secures
peace.**

United States and Europe and Senior Fellow, Project on International
Order and Strategy at Brookings; Foreign Affairs, "The Folly of
Retrenchment: Why America Can't Withdraw From the World,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2020-02-10/folly-retrenchment\]

A fifth problem with [[retrenchment]{.mark}]{.underline} is that it
[[lacks]{.underline}]{.mark} domestic [[support]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The American people may favor greater burden sharing, but there is no
evidence that they are onboard with a withdrawal from Europe and Asia.
As a survey conducted in 2019 by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs
found, seven out of ten Americans believe that [[maintaining military
superiority makes the United States safer]{.mark},]{.underline} and
almost three-quarters think that [[alliances contribute to U.S.
security]{.underline}]{.mark}. A 2019 Eurasia Group Foundation poll
found that over 60 percent of [[Americans want to maintain or increase
defense spending]{.underline}]{.mark}. As it became apparent that
[[China and Russia would benefit from]{.underline}]{.mark} this shift
toward [[retrenchment,]{.underline}]{.mark} and as the United States'
democratic allies objected to its withdrawal, the domestic political
backlash would grow. [[One result]{.underline}]{.mark} could be a
prolonged foreign policy debate that [[would cause the United States to
oscillate between retrenchment and reengagement,]{.underline}]{.mark}
creating uncertainty about its commitments and thus [[raising the risk
of miscalculation]{.underline}]{.mark} by Washington, its allies, or its
rivals.

Over the past six months, the [[world has edged **closer** to **nuclear
war**]{.underline}]{.mark} than it has been since the Cuban Missile
Crisis. The Doomsday Clock is ticking toward midnight. The global
[[power balance has been]{.underline}]{.mark} dramatically
**[[reshuffled]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the [[potential
for]{.underline}]{.mark} disastrous [**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulation
[hasn\'t been so high in **80 years**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The match
and fuse for this is instability --- [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}n
exaggerated [[sense of U.S. **weakness** and lack of
**capability**]{.mark} and **resolve**]{.underline} --- that [[could
lead to **huge**]{.mark}, **aggressive** military
**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulations and **mistakes** by]{.underline} our
**[enemies]{.underline}**. The Biden administration has set the table
for such a catastrophe.

The timing could not be more dangerous. [[**China**
has]{.underline}]{.mark} changed strategic direction and has [[been
building its nuclear stockpile]{.mark} and]{.underline} delivery
systems. China also has [continued to develop [hypersonic
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, including stand-off "carrier killers,"
space weapons and cyber capabilities to blind opponents' strategic and
conventional systems. [**Russia** has been advertising]{.underline}
(mostly for domestic consumption, but nonetheless worrying) [its
"unstoppable" delivery systems]{.underline}, and has a very capable
nuclear stockpile and military. [**Iran** will continue to move forward
with building nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Pakistan and India both have
significant nuclear capability in an increasingly unstable part of the
world. Nuclear-armed North Korea is again assuming a more belligerent
posture. Israel has a full nuclear triad (land, air, subs) to respond to
existential aggression. The U.K. and France have significant nuclear
deterrents. The world is a powder keg.

In Hollywood terms, [[today's capacity for **nuclear

times greater** than]{.underline}]{.mark} the era portrayed [[in]{.mark}
the **[Armageddon films]{.mark}**]{.underline} "On the Beach," "Fail

than the flu typically does. [[**Nuclear war** could **kill us
all**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Our leaders must get their priorities
straight.

Institution and the author of The World America Made, "Backing Into

sg

That shift may come too late. It was in the 1920s, not the 1930s, that
the democratic powers made the most important and ultimately fatal
decisions. Americans' disillusionment after World War I led them to
reject playing a strategic role in preserving the peace in Europe and
Asia, even though America was the only nation powerful enough to play
that role. The withdrawal of the United States helped undermine the will
of Britain and France and encouraged Germany in Europe and Japan in Asia
to take increasingly aggressive actions to achieve regional dominance.
Most Americans were convinced that nothing that happened in Europe or
Asia could affect their security. It took World War II to convince them
that was a mistake. The "return to normalcy" of the 1920 election seemed
safe and innocent at the time, but the essentially selfish policies
pursued by the world's strongest power in the following decade helped
set the stage for the calamities of the 1930s. By the time the crises
began to erupt, it was already too late to avoid paying the high price
of global conflict. In such times, [it has always been tempting to
believe that geopolitical competition can be solved through efforts at
cooperation and accommodation]{.underline}. [The idea]{.underline},
recently proposed by Niall Ferguson, [that the world can be ruled
jointly by the United States, Russia, and China]{.underline} is not a
new one. Such condominiums [have been proposed]{.underline} and
attempted [in every era when the dominant power]{.underline} or powers
in the international system [sought to fend off challenges
from]{.underline} the [dissatisfied revisionist powers]{.underline}. It
has rarely worked. [**[Revisionist great powers are not easy to
satisfy]{.underline}** **[short of complete
capitulation]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[[Their]{.mark} [sphere]{.mark}
of [influence is never quite large enough to satisfy]{.mark} their
[pride or]{.mark} their expanding [need for
security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact, [their]{.underline} very
[expansion creates insecurity]{.underline}, [by frightening neighbors
and leading them to band together against the rising power]{.underline}.
The satiated power that Otto von Bismarck spoke of is rare. The German
leaders who succeeded him were not satisfied even with being the
strongest power in Europe. In their efforts to grow still stronger,
[they produce]{.underline}d [coalitions against them, making their fear
of "encirclement" a self-fulfilling prophecy.]{.underline} BEIJING,

common trait of [rising powers]{.underline} --- their actions [produce
the very insecurity they claim to want to redress.]{.underline} They
harbor grievances against the existing order (both Germany and Japan
considered themselves the "have-not" nations), but [their grievances
cannot be satisfied so long as the existing order remains in
place]{.underline}. Marginal concession is not enough, but the powers
upholding the existing order will not make more than marginal
concessions unless they are compelled to by superior strength. Japan,
the aggrieved "have-not" nation of the 1930s, did not satisfy itself by
taking Manchuria in 1931. Germany, the aggrieved victim of Versailles,
did not satisfy itself by bringing the Germans of the Sudetenland back
into the fold. They demanded much more, and they could not persuade the
democratic powers to give them what they wanted without resorting to
war. **[[Granting]{.mark} the revisionist powers [spheres of
influence]{.mark} [is]{.mark} not a recipe for peace and tranquility but
rather [an invitation to inevitable conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Granting the revisionist powers spheres of influence is not a recipe for
peace and tranquility but rather an invitation to inevitable conflict.
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} historical [[sphere]{.mark} of
influence]{.underline} does not end in Ukraine. It [begins in Ukraine.
It [extends to the Baltic States]{.mark}, to the Balkans, [and to the
heart of Central Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[within]{.mark}
[Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} traditional [[sphere]{.mark} of
influence]{.underline}, **[other [nations do not enjoy autonomy]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} even [sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There was no
independent Poland under the Russian Empire nor under the Soviet Union.
[For China to gain its desired sphere of influence]{.underline} in East
Asia [will mean that, when it chooses, it can close the region off to
the United States]{.underline} --- not only militarily but politically
and economically, too. China will, of course, inevitably exercise great
sway in its own region, as will Russia. [The United States cannot and
should not prevent China from being an economic powerhouse. Nor should
it wish for the collapse of Russia]{.underline}. **[The United States
should even welcome competition]{.underline}** of a certain kind. Great
powers compete across multiple planes --- economic, ideological, and
political, as well as military. Competition in most spheres is necessary
and even healthy. [Within the liberal order, China can compete
economically and successfully with the United States]{.underline};
[Russia can thrive in the international economic order]{.underline}
upheld by the democratic system, even if it is not itself democratic.
**[But military and strategic competition is different.]{.underline}**
The security situation undergirds everything else. It remains true today
as it has since World War II that **[[only the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has the capacity]{.mark} and the unique geographical
advantages [to provide global security and]{.mark} relative
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There is no stable balance of power
in Europe or Asia without the United States. And while we can talk about
["soft power" and "smart power,"]{.underline} they have been and [always
will be of limited value when confronting raw military
power.]{.underline} Despite all of the loose talk of American decline,
[it is in the military realm where U.S. advantages remain
clearest]{.underline}. Even in other great powers' backyards, the United
States retains the capacity, along with its powerful allies, to deter
challenges to the security order. But **[[without]{.mark} a U.S.
[willingness to maintain the balance]{.mark} in far-flung regions of the
world]{.underline}**, [[the system will buckle]{.mark}
[under]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[unrestrained military
competition]{.underline} [of regional powers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Part
of that willingness entails defense spending commensurate with America's
continuing global role. **[For the United States [to accept a return to
spheres of influence]{.mark}]{.underline}** would not calm the
international waters. It **[[would]{.mark} merely [return the world
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the condition it was in at the end of the 19th
century, with **[[competing great powers clashing]{.mark} over
inevitably intersecting and overlapping spheres]{.underline}**.
**[[These]{.mark} unsettled, disordered [conditions produced the fertile
ground for the]{.mark} two destructive [world
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the first half of the 20th century. The
collapse of the British-dominated world order on the oceans, the
disruption of the uneasy balance of power on the European continent as a
powerful unified Germany took shape, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the rise
of Japanese power in East Asia all contributed to [a highly competitive
international environment in which dissatisfied great powers took the
opportunity to pursue their ambitions in the absence of any power or
group of powers to unite in checking them]{.underline}. [The
result]{.underline} [was]{.underline} an [**[unprecedented global
calamity and death on an epic scale]{.underline}**.]{.mark} It has been
the great accomplishment of the U.S.-led world order in the 70 years
since the end of World War II that this kind of competition has been
held in check and great power conflicts have been avoided. [It will be
more than a shame if Americans were to destroy what they
created]{.underline} --- [and not because it was no longer possible to
sustain but simply because they chose to stop trying.]{.underline}

#### Hegemony is key to global stability and peace -- multipolarity breaks down international order through overlapping spheres of influence, 

**Drezner 15** (Daniel Drezner -- Tufts University IR professor,
Brookings Institution senior fellow, US German Marshall Fund fellow,
Council on Foreign Relations fellow, and Harvard University fellow,
winter 2015, America's Quarterly, "A Post-Hegemonic Paradise in Latin
America?",
http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/post-hegemonic-paradise-latin-america,
accessed 8/19/17,

[Despite the reasons for optimism, there are better reasons for
pessimism. History provides ample reasons for why Latin America would
resent U.S. hegemony. Nevertheless, there is significant evidence that
[American hegemony acted as a]{.mark} powerful [booster for
international security and stability]{.mark}]{.underline}.8 Beginning
with economic historian Charles Kindleberger, a wide range of
international relations theorists have posited that [[a]{.mark} liberal
[hegemon is]{.mark} a [necessary]{.mark} and sufficient condition
[for]{.mark} the creation of an open global [economic order]{.mark}.9 In
a unipolar system, [the]{.mark} lone [superpower can provide]{.mark} an
array of public [goods]{.mark} in exchange [for]{.mark} the
[cooperation]{.mark} of other states]{.underline}.10 Dartmouth professor
William Wohlforth has made the strongest set of theoretical arguments
for this position during the post-Cold War era. He argues, contra
balance-of-power theorists, that unipolarity is the most stable and
peaceful of all possible international systems because [[it
eliminates]{.mark} unproductive [great power rivalries]{.mark}.11 [The
post-Cold War era]{.mark} [offers]{.mark} strong [evidence for
reduced]{.mark} security [rivalries and greater stability in a hegemonic
world order.]{.mark} The Human Security Report Project has tracked a
marked and secular [decline in interstate violence]{.mark} since the end
of the Cold War.12 There has been a further decline in other forms of
violence, such as civil war and extrajudicial killings. Consistent with
the logic of hegemony, global [military expenditures declined
dramatically]{.mark} following the end of the Cold War. Global
expenditures on defense as a percentage of global output averaged 5.1
percent between 1972 and 1990]{.underline}. In the decade after the
September 11th attacks, defense expenditures as a percentage of global
output averaged only 2.5 percent.13 Latin American defense spending as a
percentage of output was even smaller during this period. [**[The peace
dividend from hegemony was significant]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the
wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the perception of waning U.S.
hegemony has been widespread. It is therefore worth noting that this
perceived decline has been matched by a dramatic increase in Latin
American defense spending. By one measure, absolute defense spending in
Latin America practically doubled between 2006 and 2011.14 By 2012,
defense spending accounted for approximately 4 percent of total
GDP---significantly higher than in the rest of the world.15 In 2013,
Latin America increased its defense expenditures, even as the rest of
world decreased its military spending. To be sure, much of this defense
spending is in response to U.S. preferences, such as combatting
narco-trafficking. Yet the region's increased military budgets are
somewhat puzzling, given the ostensible absence of tensions among the
countries. They suggest that even if war is comparatively rare in Latin
America, security dilemmas and militarized tensions are more common.16
Beyond the insecurity posed by a multipolar world, however, is the
uncertainty that comes from an institutionally thicker world.17 This
sounds paradoxical. Nevertheless, the [[proliferation of nested and
overlapping regimes]{.mark} does not necessarily lead to an increase in
rule-based outcomes. Institutional thickening [allows]{.mark} different
[governments to engage in forum-shopping]{.mark} to find the regime most
friendly to their preferences. Forum-shopping weakens the power of
pre-existing focal points, raises the costs and complexity of monitoring
and compliance, [and creates conflicting]{.mark} legal [obligations at
the regional level.]{.mark} This situation endows great powers with
fewer constraints and greater capabilities to affect outcomes. In the
process, institutional proliferation [erodes]{.mark} the causal
mechanisms through which regimes ostensibly strengthen [international
cooperation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Paradoxically, after a certain point,
the proliferation of global governance structures shifts the
international system towards a more Hobbesian environment.

botanical metaphor in Kagan's book title began our recent conversation.
"[We've been living in a tranquil garden of largely peaceful practices
and liberal expectations across much of the world, ignoring the dark
forces of jungle multiplying under the rocks]{.underline}. If we don't
defend civilization's cultivation---especially American's guarantee of
peace and economic integration across the world---the toxic creatures

[fiery authoritarians on the march in so many once democratic

As Kagan continued, "[Trump has been damaging the
system](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/07/20/to-destroy-the-liberal-world-order-trump-putin-and-the-imperiled-trans-atlantic-alliance/)---he
too seems to have forgotten what good it has delivered---but actually
America's desire for maintaining the global order has been diminishing
for years. After [the dissolution of the Soviet empire in the
1990s](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/collapse-soviet-union),
people talked about ['the end of
history"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man)---that
America didn't have to worry anymore about war or aggression. History
doesn't end, it simply paused. The ugliest aspects of human nature are
surging again." Vanishing Leadership, Vanishing Peace Kagan's
apocalyptic message, repeated [in other recent
writings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/welcome-to-the-jungle/2018/10/09/0f8ffb58-cbc5-11e8-a3e6-44daa3d35ede_story.html?utm_term=.f6e9637dc215),
is lucid and terrifying, all the more devastating for its relentless use
of history. It's a footnoted plea that "we've seen this movie before."
[He reminds us that **[Americans have frequently turned away from
defending world order, with regrettably familiar outcomes]{.mark}**: [to
be dragged in later]{.mark} at greater cost (e.g. [helping to stop
Hitler earlier might have prevented World War
II](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/the-debate-behind-us-intervention-in-world-war-ii/277572/));
or, simply hoping that "the problem would go away," [to watch it get ten
times worse]{.mark} (e.g. [Obama's policy in
Syria](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/12/29/obama-never-understood-how-history-works/))]{.underline}.
Kagan acknowledges that America has sometimes misstepped (e.g. Viet Nam,
Iraq), but he still argues that overall [our foreign engagement has
produced more peace and prosperity than not. "History
shows,"]{.underline} he summarized, "[[that world order has never been
achieved without some constructive force to keep the peace]{.mark}. The
relative harmony and fair play we've created in the modern world will
vanish if the U.S. forsakes international leadership."]{.underline} Can
Today's Peaceful Garden Be Saved? "The odds are against our preserving
today's world order," Kagan flatly commented. "But the game isn't over,
and demise isn't inevitable. But any rescue will require lots of new
thinking and bucking current political tides." I turned our discussion
to leadership, probing about the skills and mindsets of the people who
built the postwar liberal order. So what would take to rebuild it now?
His replies led to several interesting insights beyond the book per se.
Four have implications for all of us who should care about keeping the
garden safe\--as leaders in our own right, citizens of this country, and
future voters in important elections forthcoming. 1. [[Today's]{.mark}
global [liberal order was built piecemeal]{.mark}, [evolving]{.mark}
more [through continuous improvemen]{.mark}t than "grand
design."]{.underline} Kagan quickly listed the post-WWII [building
blocks of the order, led by the U.S---"first undoing the military
capability of Japan and Germany, and then fostering their financial
success; economic integration for them and others based on open
trade]{.underline} and fair competition with America; creating a
democratic and liberal culture among allies, guaranteed by America's
power, and our willingness to punish those who threatened it." Yet he
resisted the idea of any detailed vision. "The system emerged step by
step as different American statesmen took on this or that immediate
problem. How to keep Germany and Japan from causing war again? OK, next
how to make it worthwhile for them and other nations to invest in trade
and business, not more armies? And then, later, how to push back on
Russia and Communism when they started to threaten the order?" "It
wasn't a vision but a process. [[As broader benefits started to accrue,
allies saw the value, and with that we built further on what had been
achieved]{.underline}]{.mark}. When we made mistakes---like Viet
Nam---we had the strength to learn and course-correct, as [Reagan led us
to do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan)." So perhaps, I
reflect, thinking of our discussion, we need to stop worrying about big
theoretical frameworks, and start tackling specific problems to protect
the garden we have---and just keep learning from mistakes and building
on progress. 2. Today's order emerged from "generational leadership."
Though Kagan acknowledges contributions of well-known policy
makers---[Dean Acheson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Acheson),
[George Kennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan),
[Franklin D.
Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt), [Harry
Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman) et al\-- he
de-emphasized any "[great man
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory).\" "The legacy
was created by a whole generation, people born in the 1890s, who lived
through the optimism of the early 20th C., and then watched it collapse
in forty years of conflict. They had a shared experience, animated by
fear and memory of war, so they worked together to prevent reemergence
of the same horror. American Presidents have implicitly accepted that
challenge and reliably invested in the order---until recently." And as
we all join political debates and go to the polls in coming weeks, we
might thus ask: has the current generation of American leaders lost
touch with the risk of abandoning our global role? 3. The best leaders
refuse the "either/or" choice between domestic and foreign policy
investment. Kagan railed about [prioritizing domestic welfare over
keeping the peace
abroad](https://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/why-presidents-love-foreign-affairs/).
"Americans have periodically shied away from foreign affairs, claiming
'we can't afford to maintain military bases and also take care of our
own people.' Or that our own 'social justice' is more important than
'freedom in the world.' When we turn inwards we threaten our own
prosperity and even survival. The greatest advances in racial justice in
this country happened while we were building the liberal world order.
Our guarantees of world commerce is what allows our own economy and
people to flourish. Our military leadership is what protects us from the
evil actors gunning for us today." As we spoke further, I came to
appreciate [the [complex leadership needed to build and maintain
the]{.mark} liberal world [order]{.mark}]{.underline} that we still
enjoy---engagement and capabilities on three levels at the same time:
first, leaders with strength and [courage against foes]{.underline};
second, leaders that also have empathy [and]{.underline} ability to
[collaboratively guide fractious allies]{.underline}; third, also
leadership skills for teaching and inspiring the citizens of our
country. This third element in fact sparked Kagan's final thoughts and
the insight below. 4. We desperately need leaders who can explain and
mobilize the rebuilding of this most precious asset. Kagan had a ready
list to save the flagging liberal order (indeed reversing Trump's
current approach)---"rebuild our [allies'
solidarity](https://www.state.gov/s/l/treaty/collectivedefense/);
strengthen our [global security
guarantees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security);
[re-assert the practices of free
trade](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-believe-the-spin-trump-still-hates-free-trade/2018/08/01/274544ac-95a5-11e8-a679-b09212fb69c2_story.html?utm_term=.1264c6dfd5c6);
and pressure [countries like Hungary, Poland, and Turkey to stop
backsliding on democratic
values](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2018.1491401)."
But most important, he called for [new American leadership that can
rally tomorrow's citizens around what our fathers' generation
collectively and intuitively knew---that the world is fundamentally
dangerous; that peace and prosperity are not natural; that [preserving
an international liberal community **depends critically on America's
political will**]{.mark} to invest money [and]{.mark} lives to keep open
markets, and prevent violence against our allies and
values.]{.underline} Kagan closed with a blend of pessimism and
aspiration. "It's very difficult to explain all this to the American
people. Even the gifted FDR struggled with the challenge. But we need a
president now who can convince Americans that preserving our global
liberal system is absolutely worth doing. That the cost of letting it
come undone will be so much more than saving it. We have to find leaders
who can motivate tomorrow's generation to join this cause, and do
whatever it takes, so [our nation can reassert our fundamentally
benign---even if self-interested---[hegemony]{.mark} in the
world."]{.underline}

[[Different kinds of international systems confront hegemons with
varying relationships between]{.mark} military capabilities
([protection]{.mark}) [and]{.mark} the economy
([production]{.mark})]{.underline}. In different ideal-type "worlds,"
complementarity between protection and production---and therefore the
costs and benefits of hegemony---add up very differently. These worlds
map on to different historical international 5 Cf. Christopher Layne,
"This Time It's Real: The End of Unipolarity and the Pax Americana,"
International Studies Quarterly 56, no. 1 (March 2012): 203--13; quote
on 207. systems and, it turns out, different key arguments often
propounded as universal in the literature on hegemony. [The first set of
highly relevant interactions that vary through time concerns productive
economic activity and military strength. Here [the key variation
pertains to]{.mark} the degree to [which military strength is
necessary]{.mark} for wealth and the degree to which civilian economic
productivity is necessary for military power]{.underline} (see Table 1).
When strong states can grab economic resources by force, military power
is necessary to protect and acquire wealth. Under these circumstances,
militarily weak states can create wealth, but they cannot protect
wealth. Militarily powerful states do not need to create wealth; they
can acquire wealth by conquering and looting weaker states. Under these
conditions, states can be affluent without a productive civilian economy
but not without military capability. Easy lootability clearly has
implications for the profitability of being a militarily potent economic
predator[. When civilian economic productivity is not required for
military power, we are in a stark "state-of-nature" world in which
economically unproductive military powerhouses routinely subjugate and
loot more productive polities]{.underline} (northwest quadrant of Table
1). In the fourteenth century, Ibn Khaldun proposed a cyclical theory of
history that presumed just such a world.6 Unproductive but militarily
powerful societies conquered productive polities until the erstwhile
barbarians themselves succumbed to the weakening effect of civilization,
only to be 6 Susan Strange, "Political Economy and International
Relations," in International Relations Theory Today, ed. Ken Booth and
Steve Smith (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
1995), 172. conquered by the next set of barbarians. 7 [In such a world,
[the]{.mark} economic [benefits of military primacy are obvious]{.mark}.
In other cases, wealth is easily lootable, but [civilian productivity is
necessary for military power]{.mark} (southwest quadrant). Militarily
strong states can still raid, but the spoils of conquest are
insufficient to finance military prowess: indigenous economic capability
is required]{.underline}. When the positive relationship between those
who have military power and those who have wealth breaks down, a
trade-off emerges. [Developing productive economic activity diverts
resources from maintaining a coercive capability, and vice versa.
[Managing this trade-off is necessary for political and economic
survival.]{.mark} [States exclusively relying on]{.mark} booty for
[enrichment to fund military prowess]{.mark} [will be outcompeted by
states mixing predatory looting with a productive civilian
economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Until the mid-twentieth century, this
hybrid strategy was necessary to achieve great-power status, explaining
the advantage of colonial powers (for example, Portugal, Spain, France,
the Netherlands, Great Britain, Germany, Belgium, and Italy's) over
noncolonial powers.8 [Relatively [unproductive states may seek to
overwhelm that trade-off through massive resource extraction]{.mark}, as
the Soviet Union did in the mid-twentieth century (northeast quadrant).
But the postindustrial and information revolutions stacked the odds
against that approach]{.underline}.9 Because the Soviet empire was
created and maintained in a systemic setting 7 For a theoretical

Protection and the Origin of the State," Economic Theory 50, no. 2 (June

Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium

to debate the question; cf. Peter Liberman, Does Conquest Pay? The
Exploitation of Occupied Industrial Societies (Princeton, NJ: Princeton
University Press, 1996); Stephen G. Brooks, Producing hostile to
pillaging, it was short-lived by historical standards. This overall
setting prevailed with increasing strength after the industrial
revolution and into the twenty and twenty-first centuries (southeast
quadrant). During this time, however, military power continues to play a
role in establishing and enforcing property rights. To some degree,
therefore, wealth still emerges from the barrel of a gun.1 [These four
"possible worlds" derived from [the relationship between military
strength and wealth creation under conditions of low versus high

constantly changing potential for complementarity between protection and
production. In premodern worlds, specializing in military conquest could
be profitable for centuries. Yet the complementarities and trade-offs
captured in Table 1 did not figure prominently in the 1980s hegemony
literature. [This underlay the era's focus on public-goods theory and
the popular contention that security provision by a dominant actor will
tend to prove too burdensome, as others free ride]{.underline}.15 [The
key benefit of free riding on US security was reaping the obvious
welfare benefits associated with economic competition. The debate at the
time centered on whether the United States itself could somehow exit the
"atavistic" world of militarized competition or get dependent allies to
assume greater burdens]{.underline}. The whole debate assumed a
power--protection trade-off. You could be a trading state or an atavist
military juggernaut---not both. As the next section shows, however, this
debate missed the core argument here: even in the southwest quadrant,
complementarity may emerge through the logic of raison de l'Hégémonie.

### AI spikes power demand

**Remaining competitive in the global AI race will require additional
energy. Independence and supply is critical.**

**E[nergy news](https://energynews.pro/en/author/energynews/)** February
17 **2025** Trump accelerates electricity production to dominate AI
against China
https://energynews.pro/en/trump-accelerates-electricity-production-to-dominate-ai-against-china/

The Trump administration is implementing an aggressive strategy to
respond to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing
competition with China. On Friday, the U.S. president signed a decree
establishing a National Council for Energy Dominance, designed to
accelerate electricity production and streamline administrative
procedures related to energy infrastructure. Exponential energy
consumption [[The rise of generative AI has significantly increased
electricity demand]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly due to data
centers, which are essential for processing and storing vast amounts of
information. [[In 2023, these infrastructures already accounted for 4.4%
of the United States' electricity consumption]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[This figure is expected to reach 12% by 2028]{.underline}]{.mark},
according to a government-commissioned study. Donald [[Trump emphasized
the need to boost energy production to remain competitive in the global
AI market. "They need at least twice the electricity we have
today,]{.underline}]{.mark}" he stated. This announcement comes amid
heightened rivalry with China, whose company DeepSeek has recently
disrupted American industry leaders by offering lower-cost solutions.
Measures to boost energy supply The National Council for Energy
Dominance will be tasked with accelerating infrastructure development
and removing bureaucratic hurdles slowing down the exploitation of
energy resources. The stated goal is clear: to increase the United
States' energy independence and secure the necessary supply for
technology companies. One of the initiative's top priorities is to
facilitate the granting of permits for the exploitation of fossil and
renewable resources. Doug Burgum, Secretary of the Interior, stated that
"[[the only way to win is to have more
electricity]{.underline}]{.mark}", emphasizing the urgency of
accelerating investments in production infrastructure. An energy policy
aligned with economic priorities Since his return to the White House,
Donald Trump has launched multiple initiatives to revive national energy
production. At the start of his term, he declared an "energy emergency",
aimed at increasing oil and gas extraction, particularly to curb
domestic price hikes. This strategic shift, focused on expanding supply,
also seeks to meet the growing needs of the tech sector. Major digital
companies have actively lobbied for greater access to energy,
highlighting competitiveness concerns against Chinese and European
rivals. [[With this new push, the U.S. administration aims to combine
energy independence with technological leadership, in a race where
electricity production capacity is emerging as a key differentiating
factor]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### AI is pushing 10 times faster growth in electricity demand than previous decades

T. Lane **Wilson**, Sr. Vice President and General Counsel, The Williams
Companies, Feb 11 **2025**, Subcommittee on National Resources --
Restoring Energy Dominance: The Path to Unleashing American Offshore
Energy, HHRG-119-II06-Wstate-WilsonT-20250211.pdf

[[Electricity demand is also experiencing 10 times faster growth per
year this decade than what was seen in previous decades, driven by the
energy needs of artificial intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
emergence of new, large-load data centers. [[U.S. data center power
demand is expected to more than double]{.underline}]{.mark} from about
22 GW in 2023 to 45 GW in 2030 per S&P base case, requiring as much as 4
Bcf/d of incremental gas demand. It is notable, however, that this new
technology's demand needs could be underestimated. If combined-cycle
gas-fired generation provided 100 percent of the electricity for the
range of forecasts already presented, it could translate into
incremental U.S. demand for power as high as 12 Bcf/day. The growing
demand cannot be met by intermittent resources such as wind and solar.
In fact, excluding this forecasted growth, to replace the energy
supplied by natural gas to New York's homes and businesses in February
2023 alone, New York would need 285 times more utility scale solar
installations than the state in 2022 and enough solar panels to cover
549,000 football fields. And, it would require \$1 trillion in solar
construction costs. Additionally, Americans cannot rely on intermittent
wind and solar to meet demand during peak hours or extended weather
events. The U.S. saw record high power demand in 2023, averaging 35.2
Bcf/d (2.1 Bcf/d higher than in 2022), even as wind and solar grew. And
peak day demand for natural gas hit a record high of 54.8 Bcf/d in
August of 2024, highlighting the continued need for reliable natural gas
to meet peak day demand needs and back up intermittent sources. [[Peak
day gas demand for power generation is expected to increase across all
major Independent Systems]{.underline}]{.mark} Operators (ISO), due to
the growth in electrification, artificial intelligence (AI), and data
center growth.

natural gas will be essential to meet surging electricity
demand]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to [Wells
Fargo](https://www.wellsfargoadvisors.com/research-analysis/reports/ai-data-center.htm),
[[electricity demand is forecast to grow as much as 20 percent by 2030
due to the rise in AI. The oil and natural gas industry is poised to

Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/generational-growth-ai-data-centers-and-the-coming-us-power-surge/report.pdf)
projects that natural gas will supply 60 percent of the power demand
growth from AI and data centers by 2030, whereas renewables will provide
the remaining 40 percent. How does the increase in AI development impact
power demand? As Fast Company
[reports](https://www.fastcompany.com/91050626/surge-in-ai-straining-the-u-s-power-grid-artificial-intelligence),
the growing AI market is putting increased strain on the grid -- and at
a much more rapid pace than previously anticipated: "Last year, the
five-year forecast from Grid Strategies projected growth of 2.6%. That
number has since nearly doubled to 4.7%---and planners expect peak
demand to grow by 38 gigawatts. That's equivalent to the amount needed
to power 12.7 million homes, a bit more than the total number of housing
units in Texas. "Perhaps even more concerning, experts say that's likely
an underestimate of what the actual need will be, saying they expect the
next forecast (in December of this year) to show an even higher
nationwide growth rate. "'The U.S. electric grid is not prepared for
significant load growth,' Grid Strategies warned." (emphasis added)
[[Wells Fargo
[anticipates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/05/ai-could-drive-natural-gas-boom-as-utilities-face-surging-electric-demand.html)
that AI data centers alone will add approximately 323 terawatt hours of
electricity demand in the U.S. by 2030]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Well
Fargo
[explains](https://www.wellsfargoadvisors.com/research-analysis/reports/ai-data-center.htm),
[[this increase is presenting unique challenges for the power sector
because these facilities use much higher amounts of
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}: "AI-focused data centers typically use more
expensive servers to train large language models compared to traditional
enterprise servers. \[...\] The compute-intensive nature of generative
AI workloads compared to traditional information technology (IT)
workloads is presenting new challenges for overall IT infrastructure,
particularly in the form of higher levels of energy consumption."
Goldman Sachs
[forecasts](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/generational-growth-ai-data-centers-and-the-coming-us-power-surge/report.pdf)
that [[data centers will make up 8 percent of the total U.S. power
demand by 2030]{.underline}]{.mark}, from about 3 percent in 2022.

[[Producing energy resources is a necessity]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Despite earlier predictions that have since been proven wrong, the truth
is that [[the United States and the world will need a lot more oil and

[[Natural gas is a reliable solution]{.underline}]{.mark} Because of the
high reliability and lower cost of gas compared to other resources, an
abundance of natural gas in a region has become an attractive selling
point for major companies looking to build out data centers. This is
evident in the rise in data centers in natural gas-rich states like

As Coterra COO Blake Sirgo recently
[said](https://www.energyintel.com/0000018f-5e18-dc18-a38f-7ebbcbec0000):
"Lots of the demand looks like it's going to come on the East Coast.
That's very proximal to our assets. There's a lot of existing pipes
there that can easily get our gas to those markets. And we're very

he's even heard as much as a 30 bcf per day increase will be needed by
2030, adding that "we will welcome increased demand anywhere within that
range." As Energy Capital Partners' Founder Doug Kimmelman recently
[emphasized](https://www.ft.com/content/1f93b9b2-b264-44e2-87cc-83c04d8f1e2b),
expanding gas-fired generation to supply energy to data centers will be
critical: "[[Gas is the only cost-efficient energy generation capable of
providing the type of 24/7 reliable power required by the big technology
companies to power the AI boom."]{.underline}]{.mark} And Bob Hader,

in Forbes: "The solution lies beneath the earth's surface, particularly
in regions like the Haynesville basin spanning East Texas and Louisiana:

"According to [Thunder Said Energy](https://thundersaidenergy.com/), by
2030, power consumption for AI data centers just in the US could
skyrocket to 400 terawatt-hours annually, equivalent to approximately
1.3 trillion cubic feet of gas per year or 3.6 billion cubic feet per
day. To contextualize, in 2023, the United States produced 104 billion
cubic feet of natural gas per day. [[Meeting this escalating demand is

### A2 Oil/Gas Demand Peaked

#### Oil and natural gas will continue to be the dominant sources of energy -- its imperative to security and growth that we continue to develop these resources

**2023** https://christie55.com/news/2023/03/americas-energy-transition/

[[Ignoring the realities of America's energy needs for the next several
decades will jeopardize US energy security]{.underline}]{.mark}. While
renewable energy continues to grow at an accelerated pace, especially
for electricity generation, [[the US needs to face the stark reality
that the US consumption of petroleum and natural gas will continue to be
the dominant sources of energy]{.underline}]{.mark} consumed in the US
well beyond 2050. Based on these projections by EIA, it's obvious that
[[US investment in all energy resources is imperative to protect our
energy security, economic growth, and national security
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}. The energy needs of all the sectors of
the US energy economy, including electric power sector and the end-user
sectors of transportation, industrial, and residential, and must be
addressed.

#### Demand for oil and natural gas will continue to grow through at least 2050

Bob **Martin**, Managing Director at Christie 55 Solutions Protecting
America's Energy Security in an Era of Energy Transition March 29,
**2023** https://christie55.com/news/2023/03/americas-energy-transition/

The challenge for the US is that [[the demand and consumption of
petroleum and natural gas will continue to grow through 2050 and
beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}. The EIA projects that "[[petroleum and
natural gas remain the most-consumed sources of energy in the United
States through 2050]{.underline}]{.mark}, but renewable energy is the
fastest growing." They "project that [[U.S. energy consumption will
continue to grow]{.underline}]{.mark} through 2050 as population and
economic growth outpace energy efficiency gains. [[Petroleum and other
liquids will remain the most-consumed category of fuels through
2050]{.underline}]{.mark}." At the same time, IEA states that the
"production of renewable energy will grow more quickly than any other
fuel source through 2050."

#### Natural gas demand is increasing

**Hareesh** May 26, **2025**, Natural gas in 2025: A rebalancing market

Global natural gas prices were largely stabilized in the last couple of
years followed by the supply shocks of 2022 and 2023, driven by
geopolitical tensions and energy crisis. This year marks a return to
structural growth, with global demand reaching new highs, particularly
fueled by industrial recovery in emerging economies. From a sectoral
perspective, the industrial and power generation sectors are the primary
drivers of this growth. [[In 2024, gas demand for electricity generation

[[Arctic oil and gas resources can play a substantial role in meeting
future global energy needs]{.underline}]{.mark}, given their significant
potential. The United States is currently benefiting from resurgence in
oil production fueled largely by the development of tight oil
opportunities in the U.S. Lower 48. Production profiles for these oil
opportunities will eventually decline and, in its Annual Energy Outlook
2014, DOE's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that
U.S. oil production will drop one million barrels per day by 2040
compared to 2014. Given the resource potential and long timelines
required to bring Arctic resources to market[[, Arctic exploration today
may provide a material impact to U.S. oil production in the future,
potentially averting decline, improving U.S. energy security, and
benefitting the local and overall U.S. economy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/major-new-us-industry-at-a-crossroads-us-lng-impact-study-phase-1

[[The US LNG industry to date has contributed \$408 billion to US GDP
and supported an annual average of 273,000 jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These results were fueled by private expenditures totaling \$289 billion
across the extended LNG value chain over the past decade. In addition,
the industry's economic impact stretches beyond core gas producing
regions, [[as LNG' s full associated value chain extends across multiple
states and industry sectors,]{.underline}]{.mark} including steel,
equipment manufacturing, and construction among others. The \$289
billion of private expenditures stimulates the three levels of standard
activity across the United States' national economy. The first level,
known as direct activity, aggregates all expenditure allocated directly
to US businesses across the LNG value chain. For example, from 2016
through 2024 over 75% of the private expenditure focused on capital
expenditures that expanded the upstream, pipeline and liquefaction
infrastructure required to support the rapidly growing LNG export
sector. [[Over half of these capital expenditures flowed to the
construction and manufacturing sectors, directly supporting numerous
skilled high-paying jobs.]{.mark}]{.underline} The second level, known
as indirect activity, is typified as the capital allocated by the
primary recipients of direct expenditure to continue to deploy it across
their multi-tiered extended supply chains. Finally, [[employees of the
direct and indirect businesses spend their wages and income across the
US economy, triggering]{.underline}]{.mark} the third level, known [[as
induced activity]{.underline}]{.mark}. LNG\'s economic impact was
quantified across five economic indicators using S&P Global\'s
proprietary integrated economic modelling framework: Sales activity: the
value of direct and follow-on sales transactions that are catalysed by
private expenditures across the LNG export value chain Contribution to
GDP: the "value added" component of sales activity contributes to US GDP
Jobs: to support a given level of sales activity, businesses must hire
and retain employees Labor income: the compensation paid to workers
Federal and state taxes: Tax contributions by businesses and employees
associated to industry.

Growth projections for US LNG, as analyzed by S&P Global, align with a
global energy system transitioning to lower carbon-intensive modes of
production and consumption. With more favorable conditions under the new
administration, [[US LNG exports are forecast to double by
2030]{.underline}]{.mark}, with projects currently under construction
accounting for approximately 60 percent of that projected growth. With
this anticipated growth, our LNG study projects that [[US LNG industry
is poised to contribute approximately \$1.3 trillion to GDP by 2040 and
create an annual average of 500,000 jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the
global front, the US share of the LNG market is expected to exceed one
quarter by 2040, supporting a large and liquid gas market that might not
exist otherwise.[2](javascript:void(0)) [[However,]{.underline}]{.mark}
there is a big "if": [[if domestic]{.underline}]{.mark} regulatory,
legal, and environmental [[barriers persist, the United States risks
losing over 100,000 jobs annually and more than \$250 billion in
GDP]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, [[it appears that 85 percent of the
resulting energy gap in the rest of the world would be filled by fossil
fuels sourced from outside of the United States.]{.mark}]{.underline}
This jeopardizes US geopolitical influence and its reputation as a
reliable and affordable energy supplier to allies and trading partners.

### LNG exports key -- Asia alliances

#### US LNG is critical to the domestic economy and exports/alliances

[[The critical role of US LNG is significant both for the domestic
economy and on the international stage. For the continued growth of US
LNG exports, it is essential that the United States
demonstrate]{.underline}]{.mark}, day in and day out, [[that it is a
supplier on which other countries can rely]{.underline}]{.mark}. As US
exports are projected to double in the coming decade, the influence of
US LNG is expected to grow. However, despite a more favorable policy
climate with the new administration, further success is not guaranteed
due to substantial federal and state regulatory, political, and
environmental challenges facing the industry, which will need to be
addressed. As the US LNG sector re-emerges after a year of stagnation
caused by the Biden administration's pause on LNG export authorizations,
it is important to recognize the industry's overall contribution to US
GDP, economic influence, and global LNG trade innovation. In our new
study Major New US Industry at a Crossroads: A US LNG Impact Study,
conducted with the US Chamber of Commerce, we found that [[the US LNG
industry is valued at \$34 billion and has contributed more than \$400
billion to US GDP since 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}, when the first LNG
cargoes were shipped from Sabine Pass, Louisiana.[1](javascript:void(0))
[[The industry has created an average of 273,000 skilled jobs annually
since 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its impact penetrates deep into the
heartland where gas is produced and transported, and supports supply
chain and manufacturing communities in the Northeast, Midwest, and
Southeast. What really brings home the industry's impact is its
comparison with other US industries. [[The value of LNG exports is more
than that of soya beans and double those of Hollywood and entertainment
exports]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is currently half that of
semiconductors, but within a few years, could equal the value of all
semiconductor exports. What has made this unprecedented growth possible
is the vast resource base developed during the US shale revolution,
compounded by entrepreneurial energy, infrastructure, and industrial
skill. Despite a 13 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) growth in LNG
feedgas requirements since 2016, domestic wholesale gas prices have
continued their downward trend, with only temporary interruptions due to
rapid post-COVID growth and geopolitical events such as Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While US LNG exports account for
only 12 percent of the domestic gas market, they supply nearly a quarter
of global LNG supplies, making the United States the world's largest LNG
supplier. [[This outsized role in the international gas market is
supported by]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the flexibility and reliability of
US LNG]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is traded with fewer restrictions on
destinations, volumes, or pricing compared to much of the global LNG
market. Additionally, US LNG has significantly contributed to emissions
reductions in countries that have replaced more carbon-intensive coal
and fuel oil with LNG. In terms of trade, US LNG helps offset trade
deficits with both Europe and China. In Europe, US LNG is viewed as a
reliable and strategic supply mechanism, while in China, it helps
mitigate the United States' largest single trade deficit. [[US LNG
exports to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also support energy security
for these key allies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

increased supply, [[relying on last year's US playbook is not likely to

[[the certainty that we will stand by our allies]{.underline}]{.mark}

critical part of this certainty]{.underline}]{.mark}, and our
adversaries illuminate our vacillations when they occur. To this end, it
is imperative that government officials avoid giving credence to calls
for export bans and trade embargoes. Energy supplies are tight and will
likely remain so, in part (but not fully) because of the geopolitical
tensions created on both the Atlantic and Pacific fronts. Prices will
continue to be high, and [[there will be calls]{.underline}]{.mark} from
some quarters---as there have been already from some in the US, Europe,
and Australia---[[to placate domestic audiences]{.underline}]{.mark} by
backing away from the commitments and difficult decisions necessary to
confront totalitarian adversaries. [[Only by showing

providing energy to support our allies will the democratic nations of
the world see this and other coming winters through as a united

highlighted for Europe that energy security is inseparable from national
security. Now a second front is opening, highlighting once again that
energy security is crucial to national security, as Russia---with help
from China---starts to play its gas geopolitical game in Asia. [[This is
not a time to be timid or uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[We must

and support our trading partners. We must also demand that our trading
partners and allies apply similarly uncompromising logic. Winter will
shortly be upon our allies in Europe and north Asia, and storage tanks
need to be filled. Our adversaries know this and are counting down the
days.

Introduction [[Energy resources have long served as instruments of
geopolitical power, shaping alliances and influencing global economic
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}. In recent years, [[the
US]{.underline}]{.mark} went through a transformative shift, becoming
the world's largest exporter of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) in 2023 and
[[is expected to double its export capacity by 2030, maintaining a
dominant position]{.underline}]{.mark} in the market for the near
future. For the US, [[LNG exports]{.underline}]{.mark} serve four key
foreign policy objectives. First, it helps [[support its allies in
Europe and Asia]{.underline}]{.mark} by reducing their dependence on
adversarial suppliers. Second, [[the US is using energy diplomacy to
cultivate new partnerships and deepen it's
influence]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Global South. Third, its growing
energy dominance is helping its policy of
[[containing]{.underline}]{.mark} energy rich [[adversaries like Iran
and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and lastly, it can use energy resources
as a leverage in negotiations for better trade deals or to incentivise
compliance with US sanctions. This can be observed in the US-Europe
energy relations. US LNG exports to Europe, have played a critical role
in countering Russian energy dominance, ensuring NATO unity, and
reinforcing security and economic ties. This paper examines how US LNG
has reshaped Europe's energy security landscape and reduced Russian
dependence. It further argues that President
[[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} "Energy Dominance"
[[agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}, rooted in deregulation and aggressive
export promotion [[will further cement LNG as an important pillar of US
foreign policy]{.underline}]{.mark} for the near future. The US and
Energy Exports The Shale Revolution is a significant advancement in
hydrocarbon extraction, which has propelled the US as a global energy
powerhouse, surpassing Russia in 2011 to become the largest producer of
natural gas. This shift has enabled U.S energy exports to become a key
tool in diplomacy and foreign policy. For many years, shale gas
extraction was considered economically unviable due to the challenges
associated with accessing and releasing the gas from dense formations.
However, with the development of three key technologies: horizontal
drilling, hydraulic fracturing (commonly known as fracking), and 3-D
seismic imaging, coupled with investments from private sector and
substantial government support has helped the US increase production.
Between 2005 and 2024, US natural gas production more than doubled,
increasing from 509 billion cubic meters (bcm) to 1,067 bcm an increase
of 108%\[i\]. A report by S&P Global Commodity Insights, a leading
Energy consultancy firm in the US predicts that US LNG industry has
already contributed close to \$400 billion in the economy since 2016 and
growing LNG exports could support nearly half a million jobs annually
and contribute \$1.3 trillion to GDP through 2040\[ii\].
Internationally, this remarkable growth in production has significantly
boosted LNG exports and helped the US to emerge as a major player in the
energy market. In 2024 the LNG exports rose to 122 bcm\[iii\], the
highest ever. The growth in US-Europe LNG trade can be attributed to
certain advantages it enjoys over gas pipelines like mobility, less
susceptibility to political turbulence and geopolitical uncertainties
for Europe. The transatlantic journey avoids 3 vulnerable chokepoints,
the Persian Gulf, the Suez Canal and the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb near
Yemen, making it more stable and secure source of energy. By exporting
LNG to allies and partners, the US has reduced trade deficits and
enhanced energy security for allies, as evident by the inflow of US LNG
into European markets since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine in
2022. Therefore, these conditions make LNG exports very lucrative,
garnering a bipartisan support\[iv\]. The Senate committee on Energy and
Natural resources\[v\] and the Congressional Energy Export Caucus have
consistently shown support for continuing the LNG exports\[vi\].
European Energy Security and US LNG For decades, European industries and
power generation relied on Russian gas. Till 2021, Russia accounted for
roughly 40% of total gas imports to Europe, which is about 155 bcm. By
2023, this figure plummeted to 23 bcm, marking an 83% decline\[vii\].
Although the relationship was seen as one of mutual benefit, the
Ukrainian gas crises of 2006 and 2009, indicated Russia\'s intention to
wield gas for political and security concessions. Following the onset of
the conflict in 2022, Russia cut supplies to Europe, creating a "shock"
that threatened the collapse of European industries and economy. This
move was directed to cause divisions among the EU members in their
support to Ukraine by pushing certain members to choose between broader
security objectives and national economic stability. While industrial
production faced decline and electricity prices surged temporarily, the
alliance unity has remained intact. A combination of strategies
including reducing consumption, faster transition to renewable energy
and increased LNG imports, particularly from the US has enabled Europe
to counter this challenge. The Biden Administration assured [[support
and supply of American LNG, helping stabilise gas
prices]{.mark}]{.underline} which had increased to €350/MWh\[viii\],
more than ten times higher than the average prices in the previous 15
years. The US and EU also formed a joint task force to reduce reliance
on Russian gas and among other things to ensure a stable demand for US
LNG in Europe till at least 2030\[ix\]. In November 2024, European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggested replacing Russian
LNG with American ones, which could be an opportunity for the US to
increase its market share and permanently replace Russian gas in
Europe\[x\]. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA),
European LNG imports are expected to rise by 20% in 2025 compared to
levels before the start of the conflict in Ukraine. The pipeline
supplies from Norway, North Africa and Azerbaijan have reached their
maximum capacity and Russian gas pipelines transiting through Ukraine
remain closed. These developments have meant that, today Europe is the
largest market for US LNG, with 55% of US LNG exports directed there in
2024. With US LNG being more important for Europe\'s energy security,
President Trump's call for Europe to increase U.S energy imports or face
tariffs,\[xi\] highlights the role of energy as a bargaining tool for
reducing trade deficits for the new US Administration. The Energy
Dominance Agenda: Prospects Under President Trump An examination of
Trump Administration's policy trajectory during his first term and the
initial days of his second term and key personnel appointments reveals a
coherent strategic direction, favourable for the LNG industry. During
his first term, President Trump\'s energy policy centred around what can
be called as \"Energy Dominance 1.0\", which is a shift from the
previous goal of \"Energy Independence\". This shift emphasises
self-sufficiency while promoting increased production and export of
energy resources, thereby enhancing the US\' geopolitical leverage. The
first Trump Administration implemented several policy measures aimed at
bolstering the oil and gas sectors. This included repealing several
environmental regulations like the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and methane
regulations established under the Obama Administration. Additionally,
President Trump\'s decision to allow offshore drilling and the
withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement underscored his
Administration\'s drive towards fossil fuel exploitation. He also called
for expanded production of oil, natural gas, and coal, with a specific
focus on maximizing exploration and development on federal lands\[xii\].
The Administration, actively promoted American LNG in high-level
diplomatic engagements with European and Asian counterparts. Data from
the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicates a robust and
consistent rise of 318 % in LNG exports while the production increased
by 26.5% between 2017-2021\[xiii\], signifying a successful
implementation of the Energy Dominance strategy. In his second term,
President Trump signed six Executive Actions to build on his Energy
Dominance agenda\[xiv\] . A National Energy Emergency has been declared,
granting the federal government more powers to expedite approvals for
various energy projects. A new inter-governmental agency will be
established to increase oil and natural gas production. His cabinet
appointments, notably Governor Doug Burgum as the nominee for Interior
Secretary and as head of the proposed National Energy Council and Chris
Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy, as the new Energy Secretary are expected
to drive his energy dominance agenda forward and align energy
production, diplomatic objectives and economic priorities together.
Conclusion In summary, [[US LNG plays a multifarious
role]{.underline}]{.mark} in addressing trade deficits, boosting the
domestic economy and enhancing leverage in negotiations. By
strengthening Europe\'s energy security and stabilizing markets against
major disruptions, US [[LNG has become a vital tool of foreign policy
and energy diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[global LNG demand is
projected to be robust until at least 2050]{.underline}]{.mark} and with
increasing investments in export capacity expansion, [[the US is likely
to dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} the market for a considerable period.
The energy dominance strategy under President Trump would provide a
favourable environment for the LNG industry to prosper. Conclusively,
[[US LNG is more than just a commodity, it is]{.underline}]{.mark}
emerging as [[a strategic tool]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that can redefine
energy security, US diplomacy, and global influence]{.underline}]{.mark}
for the coming decades.

Nuclear Geopolitics in the Asia-Pacific. PESA Agora.
<https://pesaagora.com/columns/nuclear-geopolitics-in-the-asia-pacific/>

[[The Pacific region has been a geopolitical theatre of complex and
multifaceted nuclear politics,]{.underline}]{.mark} marked by key
milestones that have shaped the trajectory of international relations.
This represents a period of seventy-five years that has passed through a
related series of events marked by the near-total devastation of two
Japanese cities and the deaths of nearly a quarter of a million
civilians and soldiers. The period is marked by 50 years of nuclear
testing and experimentation, followed by the achievement of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (1970) and the growth of nuclear power. The
nuclear-free movement was a significant political movement that
established a nuclear-free Pacific with the Treaty of Rarotonga in 1985.
The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) came into force in 1996
but now seems undermined by recent developments and a new nuclear arms
race. Peaceful uses of nuclear power have also suffered huge credibility
problems with a series of nuclear accidents in the postwar era. Most
recently, the formation of AUKUS in 2021 as a trilateral partnership
aids Australia in acquiring a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines by the
UK and the US with an explicit security focus to build an 'Indo-Pacific'
defence capability as a bulwark against China. The compression of these
movements, policies and events has dramatically changed nuclear
geopolitics in the Asia-Pacific. The Asia-Pacific region is at the
forefront of nuclear geopolitics, where maritime strategies, power
balances and energy security converge among global and regional powers.
The interplay between these elements underscores the complexity of
achieving stability and sustainable development in the face of evolving
security challenges. The geopolitics of nuclear power in the
Asia‒Pacific region involves a complex interplay of strategic interests,
military balance and regional security concerns among key nations. The
region has been identified as a significant hub for global geopolitical,
economic and strategic interests, particularly in the post-Cold War era.
The rise of China and India, along with the strategic interests of the
United States and Japan, play a pivotal role in shaping the regional
dynamics. 187 states have signed, and 174 have ratified the CBTB treaty.
India, Pakistan and North Korea still have not signed, and five others
(China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the United States) have not yet ratified
the pact. Russia ratified, then withdrew its ratification to 'mirror'
the US position. [[The Asia-Pacific has emerged as a critical arena for
global geopolitical significance, with the maritime balance of power and
developments in nuclear weapons at sea being key
factors]{.underline}]{.mark}. The national maritime doctrines and
nuclear developments of China, India, Japan and the United States
indicate a competitive dynamic, influencing regional stability.
Prabhakar and Bateman argue the Asia-Pacific region has emerged as the
hub of global geopolitical, geoeconomic and geostrategic significance in
the post-Cold War period. The rise of China and the resurgence of India
will be the hallmark for the next 50 years. [[The nuclear dynamics
between China, India and Pakistan introduce significant risks of nuclear
instability]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region, and regional security
largely depends on how incumbent powers like the US and Japan
accommodate this surge of power. According to Salman Bashir, the Indo-US
defence partnership has impacted India-China relations and the strategic
balance with Pakistan, highlighting the importance of managing
competition responsibly. The US policy in the Asia-Pacific, particularly
its Indo-Pacific strategy, has focused on the role of nuclear
capabilities in balancing the growing power of China. According to Gleb
Toropchin, this strategy involves enhancing the sea and air components
of the US nuclear triad in the region. Stephen Lambo argues that [[the
shift towards energy multipolarity, spurred by the increase in US energy
supplies, highlights the significance of energy security in maritime
East Asia. This change affects strategic allies like Japan and South
Korea and relates directly to the broader geopolitical
landscape]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region. Discussions on sustainable
development in the Asia‒Pacific also touch upon the role of nuclear
power. According to Hans Blix, Countries like Japan, the Republic of
Korea, China and Taiwan have been commended for their forward-looking
nuclear programs, [[contributing to the region's energy security and
sustainable development goals.]{.underline}]{.mark}

demand will rise by 182% over the next decade. This shift could position
Southeast Asia among the fastest-growing LNG markets globally by

focusing on boosting domestic production to meet increasing local
demand, according to Raghav Mathur, principal gas and LNG analyst at
Wood Mackenzie. Newly commissioned and recently discovered fields are
expected to sustain output through the late 2020s. Continued
exploration, particularly in frontier areas, will be critical to
maintaining supply beyond 2035.

### A2 Exports increase domestic prices

#### US LNG exports have not empirically increased domestic prices, residential prices are well below global averages

[[As the United States ramps back its LNG export capabilities, activists
[are once
again](https://www.eenews.net/articles/trumps-push-for-more-lng-exports-risks-domestic-price-surge/#:~:text=To%20Cicio%2C%20it's%20simple.,and%20lack%20of%20pipeline%20capacity.)
claiming that exports will cause domestic natural gas process to spike.
But the data]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and nearly a decade of real-world
market experience -- [[tells a very different
story]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The reality is that U.S. LNG has not
driven up prices for American consumers]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact,
even [[as LNG exports have soared]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[domestic
prices have remained historically low]{.underline}]{.mark} --
[[precisely because U.S. production is strong and infrastructure
has]{.underline}]{.mark} (mostly) [[kept pace]{.underline}]{.mark}. LNG
Exports and Domestic Prices: What the Data Actually Shows Between August
and December 2024, the U.S. production
[climbed](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_prod_sum_a_EPG0_FGW_mmcf_m.htm)
from 3.85 billion cubic feet (Bcf) to nearly 4 Bcf, according to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). At the same time, prices
for residential and commercial consumers
[declined](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_dcu_nus_m.htm) from
\$23.45/Mcf to \$12.98/Mcf for residential customers and from
\$10.86/Mcf to \$9.93/Mcf for commercial users. That's not a
coincidence. [[The American Petroleum Institute
[found](https://www.api.org/~/media/files/news/2024/03/18/api-eva-lng-price-full-report)
that during the first half of 2023]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[a period or
record-breaking LNG exports]{.underline}]{.mark} -- Henry Hub prices
averaged just \$2.48 per MMBtu. That's one of the lowest six-month
averages in 35 years outside of the COVID-19 pandemic. [[Despite the
United States becoming the world's top LNG exporter in 2023, residential
prices have stayed well below [global
averages](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/average-benchmark-prices-of-natural-gas-for-selected-region-and-countries-2020-2022)]{.underline}]{.mark}.
That's because American production has consistently outpaced demand --
and because exports spur more investment, more supply and greater
efficiency.

[[All the studies commissioned by DOE to evaluate the public interest in
LNG exports identify a net positive U.S., macroeconomic benefit
associated with trade]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is true despite the
various constraints]{.underline}]{.mark} that some studies appear to
place on the competitiveness of international resources, pipeline trade,
and other critical factors for determining international trade
equilibrium.35 Of course, the interpretation of that benefit varies
across studies. Moreover, [[the net benefits are greater when resource
availability is greater,]{.underline}]{.mark} which seems to be an
overlooke.d aspect across these analyses. [[While this point is often
framed in context of a larger resource base with more elastic
cost-of-supply, it is also informative of the implications of policies
that inhibit development. If policies]{.underline}]{.mark} or lack of
regulatory action [[impede the development of infrastructure that market
signals support, the net gains]{.underline}]{.mark} from trade are
reduced, [[and domestic price increases are
greater.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is consistent with the trade example
outlined in Figure 9

#### Studies establish that greater export volume has positive macroeconomic benefits, and also that increased supply resulted in smaller domestic price impacts.

#### Increased American LNG supply allows diversification, price stability and cuts off Russia's capacity to weaponize energy

https://nationalinterest.org/feature/how-american-lng-serves-europe-and-disrupts-russia

[[Increased American LNG supplies offer not only diversification and
price stability but also, critically, a significant reduction in
Moscow's ability to weaponize energy]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
necessitates a proactive and sustained commitment from Washington to
facilitate these exports, streamlining regulatory processes and
supporting necessary infrastructure development on both sides of the
Atlantic. For Europe, embracing American LNG means more than just
filling a supply gap; it signifies a definitive break from a
relationship that has consistently undermined its security and autonomy.
While the EU is actively working to phase out Russian fossil fuels, now
is the opportune moment to introduce a 100 percent tariff on Russian
LNG, mirroring recent measures taken against Russian and Belarusian
fertilizers. Such a decisive step would significantly [deprive Russia of
the financial
means](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/sanctions-and-resetting-u-s-russian-relations)
to fuel its war machine and would render Russian LNG uncompetitive
compared to American alternatives, making it considerably more
expensive. [[While the transition may present challenges, the long-term
strategic benefits---enhanced energy security, diminished Russian
influence, and a more stable geopolitical landscape---are
immeasurable.]{.underline}]{.mark} The time for half-measures is over;
[[American LNG must fully replace its Russian counterpart, transforming
energy independence into a cornerstone of a more secure and free

### US-China War Impact 

#### US-China war is an existential threat

Armstrong **Williams 2023**. "United States is inching toward World War
III with China."
https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/02/16/united-states-is-inching-toward-world-war-iii-with-china

The United States is inching toward World War III with China. All the
lights on the dashboard are flashing. The pivot to Asia proclaimed by
past Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Massive arms sales to Taiwan.
The United States Taiwan Defense Command in Taiwan. The Quad with Japan,
Australia, and India to encircle China. The sale of nuclear-powered
submarines to Australia and augmentation of U.S. Marine forces there.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's "in-your-face" gratuitous visit to Taiwan.
President Joe Biden's repeated threats to attack China if it invades
Taiwan. Harsh economic sanctions against China indistinguishable from
the United States economic strangulation of Japan before Pearl Harbor.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's summons to deny China access to
artificial islands in the South China Sea. the Pentagon's National
Defense Strategy, released in October 2022, naming China as the greatest
threat to the United States. Nearly two centuries of humiliation of
China by the West, beginning at least with the Opium War of 1842 to make
Chinese drug addiction a western profit center. The United States
followed with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and a prohibition on the
naturalization of Chinese immigrants. The United States betrayed China
during the post-World War I Paris Peace talks by surrendering Shandong
Province to Japan. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles refused to
shake the hand of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai during the Geneva
Conference to settle the future of Vietnam and gratuitously sneered that
the two would only meet in a car crash. Taiwan is the same distance from
the Chinese mainland as Cuba is to the United States. During the 1962
Cuban Missile Crisis, we were willing to initiate war if necessary to
compel the Soviet Union to remove tactical nuclear weapons from Cuba,
including a blockade. Cuba had requested the missiles to deter a planned
second United States invasion on the heels of the Bay of Pigs debacle.
The USSR blinked and removed the nuclear weapons in exchange for a sotto
voce agreement by the United States to remove Jupiter missiles from
Turkey. Today, the United States is a vastly greater existential threat
to China than the Soviet Union's presence in Cuba was to the United
States in 1962. Why does anyone think China would react less strongly
than the United States did in the Cuban Missile Crisis to the U.S.
arming Taiwan to the teeth, repeatedly threatening war, organizing the
Quad, strangling the Chinese economy, and treating the South China Sea
as if it were the Gulf of Mexico? Why would the Chinese accept national
security risks that the United States has shown it will not? [[U.S.
relations with China are combustible. Only a spark is necessary to
ignite a conflagration that could lead to nuclear exchanges and threaten
the species with nuclear winter and extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Something similar happened before with Austrian Archduke Ferdinand's
assassination by Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip on June 28, 1914. That
gave birth to World War I, which witnessed 20 million deaths and 21
million wounded. World War III could be precipitated by a shoot-out over
the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands or the Scarborough Shoal/Huangyan Island. [[A
war involving the U.S. and China would probably
metastasize]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to the Brookings
Institution's Michael O'Hanlon: "[[Neither Beijing nor Washington would
accept defeat in a limited engagement. Instead, the conflict probably
would expand horizontally to other regions and vertically, perhaps even
to include nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} threats---or their
actual use. [[It literally could become the worst catastrophe in the
history of warfare."]{.underline}]{.mark} In recent years, U.S. wargames
have generally shown China defeating the United States. One analysis
concluded: "The overarching takeaway from participants in the war game:
If China invades Taiwan, the Indo-​Pacific region will plunge into a
broad, drawn-​out war that could include direct attacks on the U.S.,
including Hawaii and potentially the continental United States." If a
war with China over Taiwan seems crazy, it's because it is! We have no
defense treaty with Taiwan. We have no diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
It has no membership in the United Nations. It is within China's
traditional sphere of influence. It is more than 7,500 miles away from
the United States. Its independence is a featherweight to our national
security. If China annexed Taiwan, imitating our annexation of Hawaii in
1898, the annexation would not be an existential threat to the United
States. I can already hear the appeasement shouts of "Munich," "Munich,"
"Munich" from the multi-trillion-dollar military-industrial-security
complex. But China is not the Third Reich, President Xi Jinping is not
Adolf Hitler. Taiwan is not Czechoslovakia. And the Domino Theory
implicit in the cry of "Munich" was discredited by our defeat by
Vietnam. It has become a semi-ally of the United States in opposing
China. And Japan and South Korea are fully capable of defending
themselves against a Chinese invasion.President George Washington's
time-honored Farewell Address provides the path to extricate ourselves
from a war with China over Taiwan: "The great rule of conduct for us in
regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations to
have with them as little political connection as possible."

[The high [tensions in **East Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the highest
since the end of the Second World War, [[have led to fears of open
conflict]{.mark} involving]{.underline} the [states in the region [as
well as extra-regional powers]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular the
USA, By early 2013, [tensions between North Korea]{.underline} on the

[[China]{.mark}, the **[US]{.mark}**A [and]{.mark} North [Korea possess

[[Japan]{.mark} has]{.underline} always [been regarded [as a threshold

[Any conflict in this region would]{.mark}]{.underline} involve not only

over North Korea, and to a diminishing degree, China, thus [forcing them

Air-Sea Battle, which involves attacking China's surveillance,
intelligence and command systems, are likely to be interpreted by China
as attempts to disarm its nuclear strike capability and could thus lead
to a quick arid unwanted escalation into a nuclear conflict (Schreer
2013).

## Extension - Solvency

### Congress key

#### Congress is the actor that could effectively allow Arctic drilling given current restrictions

Robert T. **Anderson 2018** ARTICLE: Protecting Offshore Areas from Oil
and Gas Leasing: Presidential Authority under the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act and the Antiquities Act 2018 Reporter 44 Ecology L.Q.

https://dx.doi.org/10.15779/Z38XP6V365 Copyright © 2018 Regents of the
University of California.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on April 28, 2017 that
purported to revoke all of President Obama\'s section 12(a) withdrawals,
except for Bristol Bay. 249 It left in place the prior withdrawals
applicable to designated marine sanctuaries, but also mandated a review
of all marine sanctuary and marine national monument designations or
expansions affected within the ten years prior to the date of the order.
250 The Trump Administration\'s reaction was foreshadowed by cries of
outrage from the Alaska congressional delegation. 251 The Trump Order
parallels another executive order calling for review of all terrestrial
monument designations of one hundred thousand acres or more since
January 1, 1996. 252 The OCLSA revocation order directly raises the
question of whether a subsequent president has the authority to revoke
or modify a section 12(a) withdrawal. 253 As discussed above, because
the withdrawal was made pursuant to a limited congressional delegation
of authority, a new president may not simply revoke it with the stroke
of a pen, as some have asserted. Moreover, the withdrawal authority in
section 12(a) is distinct from the five-year leasing program set forth
in the OCSLA, which \[\*764\] provides discretion to the secretary of
the interior to leave areas out of lease sale planning. Rather, [[the
section 12(a) authority is a \"one-way\" delegation of Congress\'s power
over the OCS, and similar to the Antiquities Act, there is no grant of
revocation power to the president.]{.underline}]{.mark} 254 The
2017-2022 leasing program excluded most areas in the Arctic from lease
sales, and as noted above, the entire area was placed off limits by
President Obama\'s withdrawals. The 2017-2012 leasing program could be
amended or revised by following the statutory process to include
excluded areas, 255 but may not extend to areas withdrawn by the
president under section 12(a[[). Because these areas were withdrawn
under section 12(a) for a period \"without expiration,\" any leasing or
related activity is precluded unless and until Congress provides
otherwise. The express delegation of authority to withdraw areas leaves
with Congress the decision of whether and when such withdrawals should
be revoked]{.underline}]{.mark}. When a congressional grant of authority
is clear, it is limited by the terms Congress used, and here Congress
granted authority to withdraw areas from mineral leasing under section
12(a), but not to revoke or amend the withdrawals previously made. [[The
Supreme Court recently reminded us that \"it is never our job to rewrite
a constitutionally valid statutory text under the banner of speculation
about what Congress might have done had it faced a question that ... it
never faced]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" 256 The terms of OCSLA as written
limit presidential authority to making withdrawals. [[That should be the
end of the matter unless Congress acts]{.underline}]{.mark}. Conclusion
For over one hundred years, presidents of both parties used executive
power delegated by Congress in the Antiquities Act to protect important
objects of historic, scientific, and natural interest. But until the
second half of the twentieth century, little attention was given to
marine life, resources, and habitat in need of protection. After
initially viewing marine areas as primarily important for commerce and
mineral exploitation, the federal government has taken a variety of
approaches to protecting marine areas. While Congress has paramount
authority over all public lands and the outer Continental Shelf,
President Obama\'s protective measures taken under the Antiquities Act
and OCSLA may only be altered by Congress. As demonstrated above,
[[President Trump lacks delegated authority to reverse the withdrawal
orders made under section 12(a) of the OCSLA]{.underline}]{.mark} by
President Obama. [[This leaves the ultimate \[\*765\] authority with
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and is consistent with that body\'s
plenary authority over public lands and the limited authority delegated
to the president.

Energy Workforce would also encourage Congress to work with the Trump
Administration to address [[actions]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[can be
taken to address the]{.underline}]{.mark} Biden Administration's January
2025 OCSLA 12(a) executive [[withdrawal of 625 million acres of OCS
lands from future oil and gas leasing]{.underline}]{.mark} and ensure
that access to this region is codified in law. Despite President Trump
quickly rescinding the Biden Administration's 11th-hour ban, [[Congress
should take this opportunity to]{.underline}]{.mark} examine 12(a)
authorities writ large and [[update OCSLA in a way that realigns the
nation's energy policies with Congress's original intent; to ensure
sustained and growing offshore energy production across all
regions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additionally, legislative action taken by
Congress should codify and ensure that the multiple NEPA reviews that
have already occurred for lease sales in the Gulf will be sufficient
going forward. For example, recently BOEM prepared detailed NEPA reviews
for GOA Region-wide Lease Sales 259 and 261 and a voluntary PEIS for
BOEM's 2024-2029 Proposed Final Program. Prior to that Congress in the
IRA expressly found sufficient the prior environmental studies for 257.
Completing multiple reviews of regions that have already undergone
review will only slow down the process and not come up with any
different results.

[[Climate change is]{.underline}]{.mark} causing Arctic ice to melt,
which in turn is [[opening up access to the energy resources in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2013, Geophysical Research Letters
showed that Arctic temperatures now are as high as they were 44,000
years ago.7 As ice melts it no longer reflects light. In its place the
dark ocean absorbs light. This amplifies the warming trend because it
lowers the ratio of outgoing solar radiation reflection to the incoming
solar radiation incident. With this phenomenon, the Arctic is
experiencing unprecedented sea ice recession. This year, wintertime sea
ice extent tied with 2007 levels as the seventh smallest extent in NASA
satellite record.8 The 2019 ice extent reached a maximum of 5.71 million
square miles, 332,000 square miles less than the 1981 to 2010 level.9
More astounding figures like these exist, and [[the general consensus is
that the Arctic Ocean will be ice-free around the year
2030]{.underline}]{.mark}.10 This phenomenon of ice melting is
increasing access to the Arctic perennially. [[This enables actors to
move into these areas]{.underline}]{.mark} without incurring the cost of
expensive icebreakers, avoid navigational obstacles, and establish
staying power through permanent infrastructure. [[Less sea ice over
longer periods of time also means that the window for Arctic energy
development is larger, increasing the chances of discovering new
resource banks of hydrocarbons]{.underline}]{.mark}.11

is approximately three times the world's crude oil production in 2015

Critics contend that the fossil fuels drawn on from fracking will emit
greenhouse gases and thus exacerbate the ongoing natural climate change.
[[It is useful to evaluate the actual temperature effects of such
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}. To do so, we used the Model for the
Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC)---also used
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)---to assess the
impact of the associated increase in carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions.
(For full details, see the appendix.) [[Our HEM simulation results
indicate that CO2 emissions would increase under the scenario of
expanded domestic oil and gas production to no more than 10 percent with
respect to current projections.]{.underline}]{.mark} Thus, we used
MAGICC to simulate temperature forecasts through 2100 based on current
emissions scenarios, comparing these projections to a hypothetical
scenario involving approximately a 10 percent annual increase in CO2
emissions. Our results are contained in Chart 4 under a variety of
assumptions about climate sensitivity, namely, the Earth's temperature
response to a doubling of CO2 emissions. These assumptions, varying
between 2 degrees Celsius and 5 degrees Celsius, encompass the IPCC's
"very likely" range of potential climate sensitivities.13 As seen in
Chart 4, even under a 5.00 degree sensitivity, there is no more than a
0.03 degree increase in global temperature.14

[[Compelling evidence suggests that the actual climate sensitivity is
likely toward the lower end of this range]{.underline}]{.mark} as
climate models consistently overpredict global temperatures. See, for
example, Roy W. Spencer, "Global Warming: Observations vs. Climate
Models," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 3809, January 24, 2024,
<https://www.heritage.org/environment/report/global-warming-observations-vs-climate-models>.
As a result, it is clear that [[using the vast oil and gas resources
here in the United States will have little or no impact on global
temperature]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Even under worst-case-scenario assumptions, [[the danger of climate
change pales in comparison to the danger of energy scarcity. Energy
scarcity threatens resilient access to food, water, health care, and
other necessities of life]{.underline}]{.mark}. Environmental
protection, like human advancement, can only happen with energy
abundance. [[Energy abundance must be a national
priority]{.underline}]{.mark}. Today, America's position as a dominant
producer of oil and gas is threatened by misguided government policies
that have restricted oil and gas production on federal lands and
federally controlled offshore areas and attempted to stifle oil and gas
production on private land through overregulation. Another major
obstacle facing America's energy production is the federal process for
permitting major infrastructure projects. The U.S. permitting and
environmental review process for major infrastructure projects is the
most expensive, lengthy, and unpredictable worldwide. Multiple federal
agencies each issue separate permits, delaying projects and introducing
high cost and legal uncertainty. Capital availability shrinks and cost
of capital rises under this risk, harming U.S.
competitiveness---especially compared to China's quick, lower-cost
infrastructure deployment. Over many decades Congress has created a
"hydra-headed" system that requires a dozen or more permits for each
major infrastructure project, creating uncoordinated, overlapping
reviews. Congress has added layers of permit requirements without
mandating interagency coordination or predictable deadlines. [[There is
more than enough capital in the private economy to fund all the
investments we need for energy abundance]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
federal red tape creates often-prohibitive risk for investors, risk that
significantly raises the cost of capital for those projects that do get
built.

[[The significance of drilling innovations in promoting sustainable
practices in oil production is increasingly recognized as a critical
factor in the industry's evolution. These innovations enhance
operational efficiency and play a pivotal role in minimizing
environmental impacts and supporting sustainable development
goals.]{.underline}]{.mark} In the realm of oil production, drilling
operations are among the most resource-intensive and environmentally
impactful activities. The traditional approach to drilling has often
been associated with high costs, both financial and environmental.
However, [[recent advancements in drilling technology have opened new
avenues for more sustainable practices]{.underline}]{.mark}. Abdel Baqy,
Amgad, and Wael emphasize the importance of rationalizing drilling
expenses and optimizing the selection of drilling tools and methods to
achieve sustainable development objectives (Abdel Baqy et al., 2022). By
reducing the financial burden and environmental impact of drilling
operations, these innovations contribute significantly to the
sustainability of oil production. [[The integration of environmental
protection in offshore oil drilling and production is another area where
drilling innovations have made a substantial
impact]{.underline}]{.mark}. Dahab discusses the necessity of
comprehensive environmental protection plans, including waste management
and contingency plans, to optimize the use of offshore oil resources
(Dahab, 2019). Innovations in drilling technology have enabled the
industry to implement more effective environmental protection measures,
thereby aligning offshore drilling activities with sustainable
development principles. One of the most promising areas of drilling
innovation is in the management of wastewater from oil production,
particularly in shale oil formations. A group researchers explore the
emerging opportunities and barriers in sustainable wastewater management
from shale oil production wells (Wang et al., 2022). The study
highlights the importance of innovative approaches to wastewater
treatment, which are crucial for reducing the environmental footprint of
shale oil production. These innovations address the challenge of total
dissolved solids in wastewater and contribute to water conservation and
pollution reduction. The significance of drilling innovations extends
beyond environmental considerations to encompass economic and social
aspects of sustainability[[. By improving the efficiency and reducing
the costs of drilling operations, these innovations contribute to the
economic viability of oil production]{.underline}]{.mark}. Furthermore,
they play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and well-being of
workers and minimizing the social impact on local communities. Drilling
innovations are integral to the advancement of sustainable practices in
oil production[[. They represent a confluence of technological
advancement, environmental stewardship, and economic
rationality]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the oil industry continues to
navigate the challenges of sustainability, [[the role of drilling
innovations in shaping a more sustainable future cannot be
overstated.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**Environmentally sound practices are possible and further develop
economic viability**

[[The intersection of environmental sustainability and economic
viability is a critical area of focus in the oil production
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}. Huseynov examines the impact of
environmental innovation on the socio-economic development of countries
specializing in oil extraction and production (Huseynov, 2021). The
study employs a bibliometric analysis to explore the relationship
between environmental innovation and key socioeconomic parameters. The
[[findings suggest a positive influence of environmental innovation on
socio-economic development,]{.underline}]{.mark} highlighting the
potential of sustainable practices to enhance both environmental and
economic outcomes in the oil industry. Abdel Baqy, Amgad &amp; Wael,
delve into the financial and environmental impacts of drilling oil
wells, with a case study in the fields of Agiba Petroleum Company in
Egypt (Abdel Baqy et al., 2022). The study emphasizes the importance of
optimizing drilling tools and methods to rationalize drilling expenses
and reduce environmental impacts. [[This approach aligns with the
sustainable development goals, demonstrating that financial prudence and
environmental stewardship can coexist and reinforce each other in the
oil drilling sector]{.underline}]{.mark}. A group researchers provide a
unique perspective by assessing the economic impact and risk of sand and
dust storms on Kuwait&#39;s oil and gas industry (Al-Hemoud et al.,
2019). The study quantifies the economic costs and nonproductive lost
hours due to these natural events, underscoring the need for effective
mitigation strategies. This research highlights the broader
environmental challenges the oil industry faces and the economic
implications of environmental factors, reinforcing the importance of
innovative solutions to manage such risks. These studies collectively
illustrate the dual impact of drilling innovations on environmental and
economic aspects in the oil production industry. They underscore the
necessity of integrating environmental sustainability with economic
considerations, demonstrating that innovative practices in drilling can
lead to improved environmental outcomes without compromising economic
growth. This balance is crucial for the long-term viability and
responsibility of the oil industry in the face of global sustainability
challenges. Adding to the discourse, the study by provides a pertinent
perspective on the role of integrated water resource management in
regions heavily involved in oil drilling, such as South West Nigeria
(Banso et al., 2023). Their [[comprehensive review of strategies and
outcomes in this area offers valuable insights into how effective
management of water resources can contribute to the environmental and
economic aspects of oil production.]{.underline}]{.mark} While the study
primarily focuses on water resource management, its implications for the
oil industry are significant. Effective water management is crucial in
oil drilling operations, both for minimizing environmental damage and
ensuring these operations&#39; economic efficiency. [[The principles and
findings]{.underline}]{.mark} outlined by Banso et al. [[can be seen as
integral to the broader goal of achieving sustainable drilling
practices.]{.mark}]{.underline} Their work highlights the importance of
considering all environmental aspects, including water resource
management, in the pursuit of economic and environmental sustainability
in the oil production industry.

Unable to demonstrate that observed climate trends are due to
anthropogenic climate change --- or even that these events are
particularly unusual or concerning --- **[climate
catastrophists]{.underline}** will often **[turn to [dire
predictions]{.mark}]{.underline}** about prospective climate phenomena.
**[The problem]{.underline}** with such predictions **[is]{.underline}**
that **[they [are]{.mark} almost always [generated by]{.mark} climate
[models driven by highly complex]{.mark} sets of [assumptions]{.mark}
about which there is significant dispute. Worse, these models are
[notorious for failing]{.mark} to accurately predict already documented
changes in climate]{.underline}**. As climatologist Patrick Michaels of
the Competitive Enterprise Institute notes:

**[[During all periods]{.underline}]{.mark}** from 10 years (2006-2015)
to 65 (1951-2015) years in length, **[the [observed temp]{.mark}erature
trend [lies in the]{.mark} lower half of]{.underline}** the collection
of **[climate model simulations, and for several periods it lies very
close]{.underline}** (or even below) **[the [2.5th percentile]{.mark} of
all the model runs]{.underline}**. Over shorter periods, such as the
last two decades, a plethora of mechanisms have been put forth to
explain the observed/modeled divergence, but none do so completely and
many of the explanations are inconsistent with each other.

Similarly, climatologist John Christy of the University of Alabama in
Huntsville observes that **[almost [all]{.mark} of the 102 climate
[models]{.mark}]{.underline}** incorporated into the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) --- a tracking effort conducted by the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory --- **[[overstate]{.mark} past
and current temperature [trends by a factor of]{.mark} two to
[three]{.mark}, and at times even more]{.underline}**. It seems
axiomatic to say **[we should not rely on climate models]{.underline}**
that are unable to predict the past or the present to make predictions
about the distant future.

The overall temperature trend is not the only parameter the models
predict poorly. As an example, **[every]{.underline}** CMIP **[climate
model predicts that increases in atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gas should create an enhanced heating effect
in]{.underline}** the mid-troposphere **[over the
tropics]{.underline}** --- that is, at an altitude over the tropics of
about 30,000-40,000 feet. The underlying climatology is simple: Most of
the tropics is ocean, and as increases in greenhouse-gas concentrations
warm the Earth slightly, there should be an increase in the evaporation
of ocean water in this region. When the water vapor rises into the
mid-troposphere, it condenses, releasing heat. And **[yet]{.underline}**
the **[satellites cannot find this heating effect --- a reality
suggesting that our understanding of climate and atmospheric phenomena
is not as robust as many seem to assume]{.underline}**.

**[The [poor]{.mark} predictive [record]{.mark} of mainstream climate
models [is exacerbated by]{.mark} the [tendency]{.mark} of the IPCC and
U.S. government agencies [to assume]{.mark} highly [unrealistic]{.mark}
future [increases]{.mark} in greenhouse-gas
concentrations]{.underline}**. The IPCC's 2014 Fifth Assessment Report,
for example, uses four alternative "representative concentration
pathways" to outline scenarios of increased greenhouse-gas
concentrations yielding anthropogenic warming. These scenarios are known
as RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. Since 1950, the average annual
increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations has been about 1.6 parts per
million. The average annual increase from 1985 to 2019 was about 1.9
parts per million, and from 2000 to 2019, it was about 2.2 parts per
million. The largest increase that occurred was about 3.4 parts per
million in 2016. But the assumed average annual increases in
greenhouse-gas concentrations through 2100 under the four RCPs are 1.1,
3.0, 5.5, and an astounding 11.9 parts per million, respectively.

The studies generating the most alarmist predictions are the IPCC's
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C and the U.S. government's
Fourth National Climate Assessment, both of which were published in
2018. Both assume RCP8.5 as the scenario most relevant for policy
planning. **[The [average]{.mark}]{.underline}** annual

**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** under RCP8.5 **[[is]{.mark} over

[WHAT]{.underline} IS THE [**EVIDENCE** OF]{.underline} CURRENT [DAMAGE
DUE TO CO2 OR **GLOBAL WARMING**?]{.underline}

Currently [it is [very hard to **find**]{.mark} any unusual **weather**
or **[weather-related disaster]{.mark}** that can be [blamed on
**climate change**]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether natural or
human-caused, [despite constant news media claims to the
contrary]{.underline}. AR6 can only point to an increase in heat
waves.28 [Weather-related **disasters** occur every year. But the trends
in the cost, as a fraction of **GDP**, or **human suffering** and death
due to them are, respectively, flat or rapidly declining]{.underline} as
explained by Roger Pielke Jr.29 and Bjorn Lomborg.30

Globally, [[most damage]{.underline}]{.mark} (around 90%) [from extreme
weather by far is [due to **flooding** and]{.mark} severe
**[storms]{.mark}**, such as **tropical cyclones**.]{.underline}31 The
most [damaging extremes, **hurricanes**, floods, and (weather-related)
droughts [have not **changed** globally]{.mark} on **climatic time
scales** (\>30 years).]{.underline}32 The [[earth has **warmed**]{.mark}
by [slightly]{.mark} more than one **degree** Celsius, [and]{.mark} the
[CO2 **concentration** has gone up]{.mark}, but the most dramatic,
**destructive**, and [deadly **extreme weather events** have not
changed]{.mark} significantly or have **declined**]{.underline}.33
[Further, 52 of 53 **studies** of disaster losses due to **extreme
weather** were unable to **attribute** the events [to human
causes]{.mark}, and the one **study**]{.underline} 34 [that did claim
**human attribution** was **flawed**]{.underline}.35

While there are [places]{.underline} in AR6 where they [claim the
frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased and]{.underline}
they try ([using models and weather pattern analysis) to
show]{.underline} these are [related to human **g**reen**h**ouse **g**as
emissions]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} do [acknowledge that there is
"low **confidence** in the human **influence** on the changes in **high
river flows** on the global scale ... \[and\] there is low
**confidence** in attributing **changes** in the probability or
**magnitude** of flood events to human **influence** ...]{.underline}"36

In the same section of AR6, they write: "... [it remains **uncertain**
whether past changes in Atlantic \[tropical cyclone\] **activity** are
outside the range of natural variability."37 A plot of US
**landfalling** major **hurricanes** is shown]{.underline} in Figure 3.

\[Figure omitted\]

As Figure 3 shows, the number of [major U.S. [**hurricanes** is
declining]{.mark}]{.underline}. The total number of hurricanes striking
the U.S. is also declining.38 In fact, [the global [weather
losses]{.mark}, due to all **extreme weather**, [are declining]{.mark}
as a **percentage** of global **GDP**]{.underline}.39

Bjorn Lomborg has shown that [[**climate** and **weather-related**
deaths have declined]{.mark} an astonishing 99% since
1920]{.underline}.40 This is very significant [since non-climate and
non-weather related deaths due to other natural disasters (earthquakes,
tsunamis, volcanos, etc.) have only seen a modest decline over the same
period]{.underline}.41 In other words, [even though the world
**population** has risen more than four times since 1920, there are many
fewer extreme weather deaths today than then]{.underline}. This suggests
(perhaps proves?) that [[humanity has]{.mark} **[adapted]{.mark}** well
to **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}s [since 1920.]{.underline}

#### Offshore drilling is safer than ever -- many new safety regulations protect against spills

[[Environmental activists have scared people into believing that
offshore drilling is unsafe. The Natural Resources Defense Council warns
that "the only sure way to prevent offshore oil spills, of course, is to
abandon drilling for oil offshore." That's simply not
true]{.underline}]{.mark}. The oil and gas industry has redoubled its
efforts to make offshore drilling safer than ever[[. Since 2010, the oil
and natural gas industry has revised or implemented more than 100 new
safety regulations to protect against spills.]{.underline}]{.mark} All
energy harnessing involves some risk, but the activists just yell "no"
and never have a workable plan for affordable, scalable, reliable energy
that already exists today.

#### Significant safety advances mitigate potential for oil spills

Over the past four decades, [[the oil industry and government have made
significant advances in being able to detect, contain, and clean up
spills in Arctic environments]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many of these
advances were achieved through collaborative international research
programs with a mix of industry, academia, and government partners[[.
Much of the existing knowledge base in the area of Arctic spill response
draws on a long history of experiences with a number of key field
experiments]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[backed up by laboratory and basin
studies]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United States, Canada, Norway, and
the Baltic countries.

#### Arctic offshore drilling is safe, more oil seeps into the ocean naturally than from most any spill

<http://www.manhattan-institute.org/energymyths/myth8.htm>

Research published in 2000 by the U.S. Minerals Management Service
(MMS)\[106\] documents the decreasing occurrence of crude-oil spills in
the OCS. Revising previous estimates first published in 1994, the
authors analyzed data through 1999 and concluded that [[oil-spill rates
for OCS platforms, tankers, and barges continued to
decline]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[107\] Additionally, [[the number of oil
spills from platforms, tankers, and pipelines is small, relative to the
amount of oil extracted and transported]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even so,
oil spills remain an unpleasant reality of offshore oil drilling.
Certainly, any amount of oil spilled into the ocean is undesirable, but
[[offshore oil operations contribute relatively little of the oil that
enters ocean waters each year.]{.underline}]{.mark} For example,.
(However, such seepage generally [[ocean floors naturally seep more oil
into the ocean than do oil-drilling accidents and oil-tanker spills
combined]{.underline}]{.mark} does not rise to the surface or reach the
coastlines and, thus, is not as apparent as oil-drilling spills.)
According to the National Academies' National Research Council,
[[natural processes are responsible for over 60 percent of the petroleum
that enters North American ocean waters and over 45 percent of the
petroleum that enters ocean waters
worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[108\] Thus, in percentage terms,
[[North America's oil-drilling activities spill less oil into the ocean
than the global average, suggesting that our drilling is comparatively
safe for the environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ironically, research
shows that [[drilling can actually reduce natural
seepage]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it relieves the pressure that drives
oil and gas up from ocean floors and into ocean waters. In 1999, two
peer-reviewed studies found that natural seepage in the northern Santa
Barbara Channel was significantly reduced by oil production. The
researchers documented that natural seepage declined 50 percent around
Platform Holly over a twenty-two-year period, concluding that, as oil
was pumped from the reservoir, the pressure that drives natural seepage
dropped.\[109\] [[Offshore oil drilling is carefully monitored for
environmental safety.]{.underline}]{.mark} Using state-of-the-art
technology and employing a range of procedural safeguards, U.S. offshore
drilling has a track record of minimal environmental impact. Modern oil
drilling is even designed to withstand hurricanes and tropical storms.
According to the MMS, 3,050 of the Gulf of Mexico's 4,000 platforms and
22,000 of the 33,000 miles of the Gulf's pipelines were in the direct
path of either Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita. The hurricanes
destroyed 115 drilling platforms, damaged 52 others, and damaged 535
pipeline segments, yet "there was no loss of life and no major oil
spills attributed to either storm."\[110\]

### Biodiversity defense

#### Biodiversity loss won't cause extinction

**Kareiva and Carranza 18** -- Peter, Ph.D. in ecology and applied
mathematics from Cornell University, director of the Institute of the
Environment and Sustainability at UCLA.Valerie, Ph.D. Candidate at
"Existential risk due to ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes back",
Futures, Vol. 102, Pg. 39-50,
<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.001>, 01-05-2018

The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds
other than CO2 could also portend existential risks. Here the answer is
not clear. **[One boundary often mentioned as a concern for the fate of
global civilization is biodiversity]{.underline}** (Ehrlich & Ehrlich,
2012), with the proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than
0.001% per year (Rockström et al., 2009). **[There is little evidence
that this particular 0.001% annual loss is a
threshold]{.underline}**---**[and it is hard to imagine any data that
would allow one to identify where the threshold was]{.underline}**
(Brook, Ellis, Perring, Mackay, & Blomqvist, 2013; Lenton & Williams,
2013). A better question is whether one can imagine any scenario by
which the loss of too many species leads to the collapse of societies
and environmental disasters, even though one cannot know the absolute
number of extinctions that would be required to create this dystopia.

**[While [there are data that relate local reductions in species
richness]{.mark} to altered ecosystem function, [these results do not
point to]{.mark} substantial [existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The **[data are small-scale experiments in which plant productivity, or
nutrient retention is reduced as species numbers decline
locally]{.underline}** (Vellend, 2017), or are local observations of
increased variability in fisheries yield when stock diversity is lost
(Schindler et al., 2010). **[Those are not existential
risks]{.underline}**. **[To make the link even more tenuous, [there is
little ev]{.mark}idence that [biod]{.mark}iversity [is]{.mark} even
[declining at local scales]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Vellend et al., 2013,
Vellend et al., 2017). **[Total [planetary biod]{.mark}iversity [may be
in decline, but local]{.mark} and regional [biod]{.mark}iversity [is
often staying the same because species from elsewhere replace]{.mark}
local [losses]{.mark}]{.underline}**, albeit homogenizing the world in
the process. Although the majority of conservation scientists are likely
to flinch at this conclusion, **[there is growing skepticism regarding
the strength of evidence linking trends in biodiversity loss to an
existential risk for humans]{.underline}** (Maier, 2012; Vellend, 2014).
**[Obviously [if all biod]{.mark}iversity [disappeared civilization
would end]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[but no one is forecasting]{.mark}
the loss of [all species]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It seems plausible that
the loss of 90% of the world's species could also be apocalyptic, but
not one is predicting that degree of biodiversity loss either. Tragic,
but plausible is the possibility of our planet suffering a loss of as
many as half of its species. **[If global biodiversity were halved, but
at the same time locally the number of species stayed relatively stable,
what would be the mechanism for an end-of-civilization or even end of
human prosperity scenario?]{.underline}** **[Extinctions and
[biod]{.mark}iversity [loss are ethical]{.mark} and spiritual
[losses]{.mark}, but perhaps [not an existential
risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### No environment/ecosystem [extinction]{.underline}.

journalist with Mongabay focusing on forests, indigenous people, climate
change and more. He is also the author of Life is Good: Conservation in

**[Just over [250 million years ago]{.mark}, [the planet
suffered]{.mark}]{.underline}** what may be described as its greatest
~~holocaust~~ \[mass death\]: ninety-six percent of marine genera
(plural of genus) and seventy percent of land vertebrate vanished for
good. Even insects suffered a **[[mass extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- the only time before or since. Entire classes of animals -- like
trilobites -- went out like a match in the wind.

But **[what's arguably most fascinating about this event -- known as the
Permian-Triassic extinction]{.underline}** or more poetically, the Great
Dying -- **[is the fact that anything survived at all.
[Life]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it seems, **[[is]{.mark} so ridiculously
[adaptable]{.mark} that not only did [thousands of species make it
through]{.mark} whatever killed off nearly everything]{.underline}** (no
one knows for certain though theories abound) **[but, somehow, after
millions of years life even recovered and went on to write new
tales.]{.underline}**

Even as **[[the Permian]{.mark}-Triassic
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}** event shows the fragility of life, it
also **[[proves its resilience]{.mark} in the long-term]{.underline}**.
**[The lessons of such mass extinctions -- five to date and arguably a
sixth happening as I write -- inform science today]{.underline}**.
**[Given that extinction levels are currently 1,000]{.underline}** (some
even say 10,000**[) times the background rate, researchers have long
worried about our current destruction of biodiversity -- and what that
may mean for our future Earth and ourselves]{.underline}**.

In 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for
the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an
uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include
climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes,
biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the
terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it "biosphere
integrity," but that hasn't spared it from critique.

A paper last year in Trends in Ecology & Evolution scathingly attacked
the idea of any global biodiversity boundary.

["**[It makes no sense that there exists a tipping
point]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of biodiversity loss beyond which the
Earth will collapse]{.underline}**," **[said co-author and ecologist,
José Montoya, with Paul Sabatier Univeristy in France. "There is no
rationale for this."]{.underline}**

Montoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity
College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world's leading experts
on extinctions, with Duke University in the US.

Montoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that **[[there isn't evidence]{.mark} of
a point at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, globally
or even locally. If the planet didn't collapse after the
Permian-Triassic extinction event, [it won't collapse
now]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- though our descendants may well curse us
for the damage we've done.

Instead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But
**[the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden
plunge.]{.underline}** **[[Ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according
to them, **[slowly degrade but [never fail
outright]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"**[[Of]{.mark} more than [600 experiments]{.mark} of biodiversity
effects on various functions, [none showed a
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Montoya said. "In general, the loss of
species has a detrimental effect on ecosystem functions\...We
progressively lose pollination services, water quality, plant biomass,
and many other important functions as we lose species. But **[we never
observe a critical level of biodiversity over which functions
collapse."]{.underline}**
