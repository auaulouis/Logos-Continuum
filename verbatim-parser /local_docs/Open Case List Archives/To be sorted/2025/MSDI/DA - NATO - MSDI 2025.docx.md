#### Uniqueness: The US is currently emphasizing deterrence against Russia due to perceptions of nuclear and other threats. The plan is a [bolt from the blue]{.underline} change from our current strategic approach toward Russia.

**AFP 24**. Agence France-Presse. "NATO prepares for Russian threat in
harsh Arctic."
https://www.courthousenews.com/nato-prepares-for-russian-threat-in-harsh-arctic/

The [simulated assault on NATO\'s]{.underline} frigid [Arctic
fringe]{.underline} was [part of]{.underline} its sprawling, four-month
Steadfast [[Defender exercise]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the [[largest
drills staged by the **U.S.-led**]{.mark} **military [alliance]{.mark}**
[since the Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Swedish gunboats sped to shore, Italian paratroopers abseiled from
helicopters, and French marines emerged on skis.

The [[message]{.underline}]{.mark} was [[clear]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[[NATO]{.mark} is [prepared to **protect itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the face of an increasingly aggressive Russia two years into the
Kremlin\'s war on Ukraine.

Last week the alliance got even larger as Sweden became its 32nd member
almost a year after its Nordic neighbor Finland joined.

\"We\'re [[signaling]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we are **ready to
defend** our territories and that\'s]{.mark} **very
[important]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at the same time as
[**[strengthening]{.mark} our [capabilities]{.mark}** [to operate
together]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson
told AFP, after watching tanks from his country engage in a mock battle
on the Norwegian-Finnish border.

\"Right now the Russian ground forces are bogged down in Ukraine, but
Russia has stated high ambitions to reconstitute itself and adapt its
force posture,\" he said.

As Russia has begun turning the tide on outgunned Ukrainian troops,
there have been warnings that Moscow could one day turn its sights on a
member of the alliance.

While the Kremlin\'s forces are depleted after heavy losses in Ukraine,
Russia has switched its economy to war mode.

Kyiv\'s western allies meanwhile have struggled to ramp up production of
crucial weaponry, and support for Ukraine is wavering.

Norwegian defense chief Eirik Kristoffersen said the number of Russian
forces stationed near his country is currently just one fifth of the
number before Moscow\'s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

\"But on the maritime side, on the air side, and [[on the **nuclear
side**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [they\'ve kept their **forces intact** in
**our region**]{.underline},\" he told AFP. \"You have this uncertainty
about for how long they will continue to lose so much versus Ukraine and
then how long will it take for them to rebuild their military.\"

#### Link -- Plan suggests cooperation rather than US leadership in the Arctic and engages Russia. NATO cohesion is dependent on strong US dominance in the Arctic\-\--The plan flips the script.

the Lines: How Clear Shifts in Nordic Strategies Create Opportunities
for the United States to Enhance Arctic Security.\"

However, [[following]{.mark} Russia\'s intervention and annexation in
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} and [compounded by]{.underline} a [**rapid
Russian militarization** in the Arctic]{.underline}, these three
[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[shown]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[**[increased willingness]{.mark}** to openly identify Russian threats
to]{.underline} the [region and]{.underline} to [[publicly
embrace]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[as]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[significant [security
partner]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As a result, these new conditions
present the United States with favorable grounds to partner with these
three countries to strengthen both military and nonmilitary bonds in the
region and advance joint interests.

The shift of all three countries\' approaches to the Russian problem
set, each to varying degrees, may be most evident in their national and
Arctic-specific strategic documents. [[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark},
which [described **increased Russian military activity** as not targeted
at the country]{.underline} in its 2017 national Arctic strategy,
**[[stated]{.mark} unequivocally]{.underline}** in its 2020 (PDF)
edition that "[**[Russia]{.mark}\'s military build-up** and **military
modernization** [pose a challenge to]{.mark} the [security of]{.mark}
Norway and **other [Allied countries]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

To a lesser degree, non-NATO member [[Sweden]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
previously emphasized nonsecurity Arctic cooperation with Russia in its
2011 (PDF) Arctic strategy and foresaw no military threat to the
country, cautiously but clearly stated in its 2020 (PDF) strategy that
[relations have]{.underline} "[deteriorated]{.underline}" and that
[[Russia\'s]{.mark} increased [military activity]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline} has [[contributed to **rising
tensions**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Similarly, [[Finland]{.underline}]{.mark}, which balanced on a thin
tightrope between criticism of Russian intervention in Georgia in its
2009 (PDF) Security and Defense Policy and the supreme importance of
bilateral commercial relations in its 2013 (PDF) Arctic strategy,
described the security situation in Finland\'s neighborhood as
"unstable" and "difficult to predict" in its 2020 (PDF) Foreign and
Security Policy and its 2021 (PDF) Arctic strategy, further stating that
"[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[weakened]{.mark} the [security
of]{.mark}]{.underline} our [**neighboring areas** and
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}." Here, presenting these juxtapositions of
[national policy paint]{.underline} a [**succinct picture**
of]{.underline} the [[change in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[region\'s]{.mark} **strategic [messaging]{.mark}** on Russia
over]{.underline} the [last few years [toward]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[**more [adversarial]{.mark}** [position]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Most strikingly, [Norway]{.underline}, [Sweden]{.underline}, and
[Finland]{.underline} have [[**uniformly shifted** to **enthusiastically
endorsing** **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates-[led security]{.mark}
**cooperation and [partnership]{.mark}** [in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} in their strategic documents. Norway\'s 2017
strategy made a singular implicit reference to security cooperation with
NATO and no direct reference to the United States in a security context;
in 2020 (PDF), [[Norway]{.mark} **boldly [stated]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that the [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is]{.underline}
"[Norway\'s **[closest ally]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Likewise, non-NATO
Sweden made no reference to the United States or NATO in a security
context in 2011 (PDF); in 2020 (PDF), [[Sweden
wrote]{.underline}]{.mark} that its "[**close [relationship]{.mark}**
[with the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark} of
**[central]{.mark} importance** for **Sweden\'s security and
prosperity**]{.underline}," adding that the relationship "also [applies
to the Arctic region]{.underline}." In 2009 (PDF), Finland stated an
interest in "intensified" relations with the United States, including in
security matters, but didn\'t prominently link relations to reaching any
end-states. Most recently, [[Finland]{.underline}]{.mark} was
[[emphatic]{.underline}]{.mark} in [connecting **increased relations**
with the **U**nited **S**tates to maintaining Finland\'s
security]{.underline}, writing in 2020 (PDF) that "the [[U.S.
commitment]{.mark} to]{.underline} the [European defense is [of **great
importance** for]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[security of]{.mark} the
**[whole of Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Again, this is a clear
change from downplaying security relations---which often have existed
for decades---to a full-throated endorsement of further integration with
the United States--led security apparatus, which points to the
increasing criticality of the United States in the region for Norway,
Sweden, and Finland.

#### NATO solves extinction

**Nichols** 4/3/**19** \[Tom Nichols is a national security professor at
the Naval War College, a member of USA TODAY\'s Board of Contributors
and author of \"The Death of Expertise.\" NATO saved us and the world.
No one should take it for granted --- especially Donald Trump. April 3,
2019.
https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/04/03/nato-70th-anniversary-russia-still-threat-column/3350491002/\]

It seems strange now to say **[[NATO saved the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Most people have no idea what NATO is, or
why it exists. (William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, some years ago quipped to one of my friends that most U.S. Navy
officers thought "NATO" was a Japanese admiral.) In America, President
Donald Trump has tried to depict NATO as a scam or a racket, in which
lazy Europeans collect American largess while doing nothing for
themselves.

Republicans have rolled over on NATO

Worse, Republicans who once cheered as President Ronald Reagan stood in
Berlin and challenged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the
Berlin Wall now meekly nod when Trump attacks our own allies in NATO.
It\'s a sign of how far Republicans --- and Americans --- have estranged
themselves from one of the greatest diplomatic achievements in history.

This is not only a tragedy but also a danger, because [[we face a
similar]{.underline}]{.mark}, if scaled-down, [[threat
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
Vladimir Putin [[as]{.mark} we did from [the]{.mark}]{.underline} old
**[[Soviet Union]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The Soviets, in their day, could not conquer and hold all of Europe.
They had every intention, however, of attacking the Western outpost in
divided Berlin and then drive deep into Western Europe if trouble reared
its head somewhere else, such as in the Middle East or Asia. Soviet
leaders assumed that at some point, the Americans and their allies would
sue for peace and surrender to Moscow's demands rather than face columns
of Soviet tanks headed for Paris, Brussels and Copenhagen.

This was more than a hypothetical danger. In 1965 (in an episode unknown
until after the fall of the USSR), Soviet military leaders raised the
possibility of attacking West Berlin in retaliation for American moves
against North Vietnam and in the Caribbean as a means of making the
Americans back down and retreat to their own shores.

NATO prevented Soviet aggression

But because of NATO, an attack in Germany meant courting war not only
with the United States but also with the United Kingdom, Canada, France,
Portugal, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and even tiny
Iceland and Luxembourg, as well as countries that did not otherwise
cooperate with each other, such as Greece and Turkey. The result would
have been to embroil the Soviet Union in conflict with millions of
people from Anchorage to Ankara, a military nightmare that would have
carried the immense risk of an eventual nuclear disaster.

Today, [[the **Kremlin regime** under **Putin**]{.mark} still
[identifies the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} its **[[chief
enemies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Like his predecessors, [[Putin is not
under]{.mark} any [illusion]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[he can create a
new]{.mark} Russian [empire]{.mark}]{.underline} from the southern
shores of Italy to the ice fields of Norway. [[Rather]{.underline},
[he]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.mark} addicted to [using
**force**]{.mark}]{.underline} [around **Russia's borders**]{.underline}
in order [[to **distract**]{.mark} his increasingly **[restive
citizens]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Like every autocrat facing his
twilight years, [Putin is **fanning**]{.mark} the flames of
**[nationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} turning the screws
of [**military adventurism** as a way of **keeping
himself**]{.mark}]{.underline} and his cabal **[[in
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[The]{.mark}re is only [one thing that can stand in his way:
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

NATO's history is not perfect. Formed as an alliance of free nations ---
it did not admit Spain until 1982, well after the end of Spanish
dictator Francisco Franco's reign --- it endured a near-divorce with
France, a Greek detour through a military dictatorship and a storm of
public opposition to modernizing NATO nuclear forces that was overcome
only by the close working relationship among Reagan, British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and other dedicated Atlanticist leaders in
Europe and Canada.

And yet in 2019, books about the Soviet Union and something once called
"East Germany" gather dust in the corner of my office while NATO
celebrates 70 years as the guarantor of European security.

We still need NATO to keep Russia in check

Sadly, this platinum anniversary is marred by Trump's hostility to our
most important alliance. The president does not know why NATO exists and
cannot comprehend the notion of an alliance because he is unable to
grasp anything that does not offer to turn a profit. But Trump's
dereliction of his duty as NATO's leader should not prevent the rest of
us from marking this milestone with respect and gratitude.

[[Every person wh]{.mark}o]{.underline} now [[walks
through]{.underline}]{.mark} the streets of
[[Berlin]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Toronto,
and London, and Athens, and yes, even [[New York]{.mark} and
Seattle]{.underline} and every small town in between --- should reflect
that they do so freely, without the shadow of either physical or
political walls looming over them. They [[do not live in
fear]{.underline}]{.mark}, as many of us once did, [that every problem
in [the world will fall into the]{.mark} dark [gravitational pull
of]{.mark} a [divided Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} lead to the **[[end]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
**[human [civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[We should]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be
**grateful**]{.underline}]{.mark} not only that we live in freedom, but
that **[[we are alive at all]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Our cities
are]{.underline}]{.mark} gleaming [[spires]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [green [parks]{.mark}, [instead of]{.mark}
piles of **[radioactive ash]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For this, [we have
**NATO to thank**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and instead of writing yet
another premature obituary to the most powerful alliance ever formed,
NATO's over half-billion citizens must find the fortitude to oppose yet
another Kremlin regime that seems incapable of living at peace with its
neighbors.

Kirill [[Dmitriev]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[who heads the]{.mark}

"It was more a general discussion --- [[maybe joint projects in the

The United Kingdom and Norway started talks last week on a defense deal
aimed at countering the threat from Russia in the Arctic that will see
the countries\' armed forces working more closely, including protecting
undersea cables from sabotage.

In October 2024, [[NATO]{.mark} Military Committee Chair Admiral Rob
Bauer [expressed concerns about]{.mark} [Russia\'s continued military
build-up in the Arctic]{.mark} and the military cooperation between
China and Russia, saying the alliance would \"defend its interests\" in
the region.]{.underline}

[It is unclear what any proposed deal between the Trump administration
and Russia would mean for Arctic security.]{.underline}

Jeremy Holt, associate director at S-RM, a geopolitical and cyber risk
consultancy, told Newsweek on Thursday that [[an **Arctic** deal between
Russia and the U.S. would be **unlikely to reduce security
tensions**]{.mark} in the Baltic Sea unless **Moscow** addressed its
hybrid activities in the region. It is unclear whether this would be
viewed as a U.S. priority]{.underline}.

He said that [[a more **transactional**]{.mark} and **bilateral** [U.S.

[[Discussions have included natural resources **exploration** and

be identified as the discussions are private and at an early stage.
[Cooperation over energy **exploration** is also seen as a goal by the
US,]{.underline} one of the people said.

The topic emerged as Trump has aggressively pursued an end to the war in
Ukraine, including direct talks with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.
[[Both sides have recently **signaled** that they're open to **business
ventures** and **cooperation**]{.mark}, [alarming]{.mark} European and
**[NATO allies]{.mark}**, which have sought to isolate Moscow since its
full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago]{.underline}.

US and Russian officials plan to meet in Istanbul on Thursday to discuss
restoring embassy staffing levels, according to Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov.

One of the people said US officials see Arctic cooperation as a way to
drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing, but cautioned that was
unlikely to succeed given how much closer Russia and China have grown in
recent years, particularly with their "no-limits" partnership since the
war in Ukraine began.

A spokesperson for the US National Security Council declined to comment.
A spokesman for the Kremlin didn't immediately respond to a request for
comment.

Asked whether the United States remains committed to **[[NATO's Article
5 clause]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Trump told reporters on Air Force One:
"[**[Depends on your definition]{.mark}**. There are numerous
**definitions** of Article 5. You know that, right? But I'm committed to

"I'm committed to saving lives. I'm committed to life and safety. And
I'm going to give you an exact definition when I get there. I just don't
want to do it on the back of an airplane."

On Wednesday, NATO leaders are expected to formally agree to a new
defense spending target of 5 percent of gross domestic product --- a
sharp increase from the current 2 percent benchmark and something that
Trump has been demanding for months.

While [[NATO Secretary-General]{.mark} Mark Rutte has [insisted publicly

[[Russia]{.mark} now [has **11 sub**]{.mark}**marine[s]{.mark}**
[capable of launching **long-range nuc**]{.mark}**lear
[weapons]{.mark}** [for use in an **all-out nuclear
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[eight]{.mark} of them [based in the
**Arctic Kola**]{.mark} **Peninsula**]{.underline}, according to the
IISS. [NATO has 22 between the United States]{.underline}, [France and
the UK]{.underline}.

In July, Russia\'s navy took delivery of a new submarine, Belgorod,
which can carry the Poseidon torpedo, a new, nuclear-armed stealth
torpedo designed to sneak past coastal defences by travelling along the
seafloor. Russian state media have said Poseidon could cause a giant
tsunami that would turn the coastline into a \"radioactive desert.\"

Moscow also has over the last two years tested a hypersonic glide
missile, Zircon, which Putin said in 2019 can reach nine times the speed
of sound, making it the world\'s fastest. In February, it said the
missile was launched in the Arctic waters between mainland Norway and
Svalbard.

\"We are starting serial production of Zircon missiles, and we have
actually put it into service,\" Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was
quoted as saying by military news outlet Zvezda on Aug. 20. Russia\'s
defence ministry did not respond to a request for more details.

Russia\'s icebreaker fleet vastly outnumbers those of other nations,
according to the IISS. Official data shows it has seven nuclear-powered
icebreakers and around 30 diesel-powered ones. The United States and
China each have two diesel-powered icebreakers in operation.

**[NATO INVESTS]{.underline}**

[For decades]{.underline}, [[Arctic]{.mark} NATO [allies stuck
to]{.mark} a [belief that conflicts]{.mark} with Russia **[would not
spill over]{.mark}** into their region]{.underline}: [With overall
defence budgets capped]{.underline}, [investments]{.underline} in
military hardware and surveillance and communication capabilities were
often [considered too expensive]{.underline}.

[Now NATO and Arctic [allies are **changing their
stance**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since Russia launched its \"special operation\" in Ukraine,
[**[Canada]{.mark}** has [pledged to boost military spending]{.mark}
by]{.underline} some C\$13 billion ([\$10 billion]{.underline})
[including an [upgrade]{.mark} of an **[early warning]{.mark} radar
system** with the United States]{.underline}, the North American
Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, [[and]{.mark} new surveillance
planes capable of **[detecting]{.mark} submarines**]{.underline}.

The first planes will be delivered in 2032. Given the challenges of the
harsh environment, it will take decades to be ready, Canada\'s Chief of
Defense Staff General Wayne Eyre told a parliamentary committee in
October.

Eyre says one reason NORAD\'s research and development component needs
modernising is to track hypersonic missiles better.

\"That is of great concern -- the ability to detect hypersonics coming
from any country -- and we\'ve seen some technological advances from
some of the competitors out there,\" Eyre told reporters in November.

He said it was difficult to judge the effectiveness of Russia\'s
hypersonic missiles based on those used in Ukraine, because the
distances in Ukraine were far shorter than any that could be used to
target North America.

Since 2020 a joint force command in Norfolk, Virginia in the United
States has been monitoring the Atlantic, but the Atlantic Council, a
U.S. think tank, says there are not enough satellites above the North
Pole to give a complete picture. General VanHerck said in May that the
military is testing some of the hundreds of polar-orbiting satellites
launched in recent years by commercial providers SpaceX, owned by Elon
Musk, and Britain\'s OneWeb.

The [[U.S.]{.mark} military]{.underline} says it [is [planning
\"**major**]{.mark} **investment [upgrades]{.mark}**[\" at]{.mark} a
U.S. base at]{.underline} Thule, **[[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
fix ageing infrastructure. A U.S. delegation travelled to Greenland in
May to explore radar locations, a diplomatic source told Reuters.

[[**Sweden** and **Finland**]{.mark} have begun [investing in]{.mark}
surveillance and **[deterrence]{.mark} capabilities**]{.underline} and
military hardware including jets [so their air forces can fight
alongside Arctic NATO allies]{.underline}.
**[[Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [[set aside]{.mark} some **[\$200
million]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} improve its Arctic military
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, including satellites and
surveillance drones capable of flying up to 40 hours, and is reopening a
Cold War era radar on the Faroe Islands between the UK and Iceland.

**[Norway]{.underline}**, whose maritime areas spread across 2 million
sq km (770,000 square miles), [has four satellites to help monitor the
Arctic]{.underline}. [It is launching four more]{.underline}, [two in
2023 and two in 2024]{.underline}. It is also investing \$35 million in
Andoeya Space to set up a spaceport. Sweden and Canada are also planning
Arctic spaceports.

Andoeya Space is a partner in an [Arctic [surveillance]{.mark} and
sensing [project]{.mark}]{.underline} led by U.S. aerospace company
Boeing Co. Based on satellites, unmanned aircraft, drones, ships and

[[Understanding that **Russia** has a history of exploiting]{.mark}
"**[gray areas]{.mark}**, where the rules and norms are less
**defined**]{.underline}," [[Svalbard's ambiguous **international**
legal status makes it a potential target for Russian
**revisionism**]{.mark}.]{.underline}17 Russian officials express
contempt for the way the archipelago's governance was determined, citing
its exclusion from the 1920 treaty talks. Moreover, Moscow views the
archipelago as part of its national identity, as an estimated 10-20% of
Svalbard's population are Russian citizens whose presence dates back to
the 1500s.18 Given Russia's interest in Svalbard's rich oil reserves and
fishing stocks,19 and recent annexation of Crimea, there is concern
Russia could make a nationalistic appeal to exploit the archipelago's
ambiguous legal status and secure its interests on the islands.20

[Norway has made repeated attempts to consolidate its jurisdictional
authority over Svalbard, including efforts to establish its own
exclusive economic zone around the archipelago.21 European countries,
including several NATO members, responded with intense
objection]{.underline}.22 [NATO members remain divided in their
positions concerning Norway's legal authority over the islands, and as a
result, Svalbard could undermine NATO cohesion and become a source of
division should Russia attempt to seize control]{.underline}.23
[[Without a clear consensus and united Western front, **Moscow** could
**determine** the risks of a NATO military **response**]{.mark} for
reclaiming the archipelago [are **minimal**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[NATO's **concerns** include additional
**challenges**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia has developed high-end
maritime capabilities and increased its presence in the Arctic as part
of a broader military strategy, outlined in Russia's 2014 military
doctrine and 2015 maritime doctrine.24 [[Russia maintains two
**strategic goals**]{.mark} in the North Atlantic and Arctic Region:
"[protect Russia's nuclear deterrent forces in the Barents Sea]{.mark}"
[and]{.mark} "**[project power]{.mark}** and fulfill Moscow's global
ambitions."]{.underline}25 To pursue these goals [[Russia has
implemented an immense military modernization]{.mark} program, which
included creating or reopening]{.underline} 14 [operational airfields
and]{.underline} 16 [deepwater ports [in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, establishing an Arctic Command and two
Arctic Brigades, and constructing newly refitted submarines for its
Northern Fleet.26 Russia's armed forces continue to conduct regular
naval exercises and patrols in the Arctic, and expand their
trans-regional radar systems and radio-electronic jamming
capabilities.27, 28 Together, these investments and capabilities are
essential to Russian Arctic dominance, increasing their capacity to
control the region's maritime domain.

**Russian and Chinese activities in the region create a "[Polar
Trap]{.underline}" that causes [great power war]{.underline}.**

Considering Chinese and Russian policies and actions, the polar regions
are becoming easy power grabs. [[Whereas the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[stands as the]{.mark} current **global
[hegemon]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or the ruling power in historical
narrative, [increased [activities by China and Russia in]{.mark} the
**[polar regions]{.mark}**]{.underline}---coupled with American
strategic dithering elsewhere in the world---[[contribute to the]{.mark}
necessary preconditions for realization of the **[Thucydides
Trap]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Coined by Graham Allison in 2015, the
concept suggests that [whenever the rise of an **ambitious power**
threatens to **dethrone** the existence of a current hegemon, [the
likely result is **war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.65

According to Allison, [**[12 of the 16]{.mark}** recorded [cases]{.mark}
of a rising power threatening a ruling one]{.underline} in the past 500
years **[[resulted in war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.66 Some, such as
Jonathan Kirshner openly, question Allison's assumptions and arguments,
chiefly that his case-selection bias supports his theory and that the
four cases where war did not result all occurred after 1945 where
nuclear weapons changed the calculus behind greatpower wars.67 Still,
[[there is **empirical validity**]{.mark} to the concept [that provides
utility in]{.mark} applying it to [a **lesser-known
region**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this way, we generate a template for
understanding future polar power competition and predicting a potential
Polar Trap under similar circumstances.68

[[The]{.mark} **Thucydides [Trap]{.mark}** [is illustrative of a
security dilemma when a ruling power]{.mark}]{.underline} proactively
[[confronts a rising power]{.mark} militarily over a **contested
domain**]{.underline}, thereby leading to greater militarization and
raising the potential for conflict. In each of Allison's cases, he
identifies the period in which the conflict occurs, a ruling power, a
rising power, a contested domain, and a binary outcome of war or no war.
Using this framework, [[there are **similarities** to the]{.mark}
evolving situation in the **[polar regions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Whereas the rise of Athens supposedly threatened Sparta and catalyzed
war, [**continued [tensions]{.mark}** [stemming from]{.mark} **Russian**
and **Chinese** [presence]{.mark}]{.underline} in the polar regions will
[likewise undermine American hegemony]{.underline}. Increased military
activities by rival competitors will continue [[producing]{.mark} the
[conditions for **confrontation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Conditions for the Polar Trap

Allison's theory stems from his interpretation of Thucydides's writings
in the History of the Peloponnesian War.69 According to Allison,
Thucydides focused on the shift in the balance of power between Athens
and Sparta as the basis for their eventual conflict. Allison contends
[Thucydides specified **two primary drivers** of the dynamic leading to
the trap]{.underline}: (1) [the [burgeoning
**entitlement**]{.mark}]{.underline}, sense of importance, [and [demand
for **influence**]{.mark} by the rising power]{.underline},
[[coupled]{.mark} directly [with]{.mark}]{.underline} (2) [the rising
power's fear and **[insecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 70 [When a rising
power demonstrated]{.underline} each of [these attributes]{.underline},
Allison and his research team found that they challenged---in some
way---the ruling power of the time. Though Allison's team limited its
study to 16 cases, [[**75 percent** of]{.mark} the historical
[cases]{.mark} meeting these criteria **[resulted in
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.71 The team further identified two cases in
which the United States was the ruling power and simultaneously
threatened by at least one rising power: World War II and the Cold War.

[[The Kremlin's Arctic ambitions have grown further this year, partly in
response to signals from **Washington**]{.underline}]{.mark}. US
president Donald Trump's sights on Greenland were interpreted in Moscow
as a sign of growing geopolitical competition in the region. America's
position validated the long-held idea that the Arctic is "the next
frontier for great power competition", reinforcing Russia's
self-perception as a key player on the world stage. Russian officials
have since reiterated that the Arctic is a "zone of national and
strategic interest" for the country.

In some ways, the Kremlin's focus has paid off. Unlike in other
geopolitical arenas where Moscow faces economic and military
constraints, [[Russia]{.mark} now [enjoys **significant advantages** in
the **Arctic**]{.mark}. It has the world's largest fleet of icebreaker
ships, maintains a strong military presence in the region and controls
more than half of the Arctic coastline]{.underline}.

[But [Moscow]{.mark} also [has significant economic]{.mark} and military
[insecurities in the region]{.mark}. [Efforts by Western
countries]{.mark} in 2022 [to isolate **Russia** from **Arctic
cooperation**]{.mark}, as well as a more ambitious US, [have only fueled
these anxieties]{.mark}. In response, [the Kremlin has doubled down on
its Arctic strategy]{.mark} in both visible and opaque ways,
[forming]{.mark} what this paper will call **[a "policy
iceberg]{.mark}**".]{.underline} Russia's massive economic investment is
the visible tip; its attempts to create a northern sea trade route buoy
at the waterline with both clear economic and murkier military aims;
while its attempts to militarise in the Arctic are submerged from
view---and the most threatening to Western interests.

In time, [[Moscow hopes the **Arctic** can become part of its
**leverage** to help **renegotiate** a "new world order".]{.mark} [This
strategy involves asserting itself in the Arctic]{.mark} not only
through economic investment and military displays but also via overt
cooperation with China. Meanwhile, [Moscow aims to use **symbolic
concession**]{.mark}**s** in the Arctic (such as arms control deals, a
revived Arctic Council or limits on non-Arctic state involvement) [as
bargaining chips for strategic gains]{.mark} elsewhere, particularly in
Ukraine. [This year's negotiations with the US showed signs of this,
with Russia using Arctic cooperation on **offshore resources** as a lure
to reopen broader talks with the **West**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Arctic exploration and development only [incentivize]{.underline} revisionism.

Currently, [[the Arctic **lacks** a]{.mark} single comprehensive
[**governance** regime]{.mark} focused on regional security issues,
[making]{.mark} the **[management]{.mark}** of the region's rapid
transformation [a **major challenge**]{.mark} for the Arctic
states]{.underline}. While the Arctic Council has "promoted cooperative
governance in the region,"1 its flexible structure and legally
non-binding norms are insufficient to ameliorate the governance gap in
the long-term. [[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates presently
**[lacks]{.mark}** crucial [capabilities and regional leverage to keep
**pace** with]{.mark} the rate of [transformation]{.mark} to provide
**regional stability**]{.underline}. Compounding the issue, "the rest of
the Arctic states\...cannot by themselves balance competing great powers
in the region."2 [[To ensure that the Arctic **remains** a domain built
on cooperation]{.mark} and diplomacy, [the West needs to **commit** to a
coherent security strategy]{.mark} to address growing **competition**
and **uncertainty**]{.underline}. Otherwise, they risk having
insufficient means to regulate interstate relations or deconflict
geopolitical tensions.

[NATO has a significant interest in preserving and enhancing the
Arctic's rules-based order, which includes open access to global sea
lines of communication, protecting transatlantic communications cable
networks, and preventing Russia from exercising unilateral military
control of the region.]{.underline} In the pursuit of these interests,
NATO is the ideal candidate to promote regional stability and
norm-setting due to its foundational principles, strategic mission,
multilateral authority, and defensive and deterrence capabilities. NATO
was founded in part as a norm-building institution, to promote European
security and stability through the development and formalization of
political relationships between states both inside and outside of the
alliance.3 By including the Arctic in NATO's purview the alliance can
use its norm-building role to impress rule of law and promote the
peaceful settlement of disputes. Moreover, the current NATO strategy
incorporates a 360-degree approach that seeks to "acknowledge and
address threats and challenges from diverse actors and from all
directions."4 It is through this approach that NATO expanded its purview
to include Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. As Russia
continues its military modernization efforts in the Arctic, concerns
over instability and geopolitical competition grow. A strategic
reorientation toward the polar region would serve as a legitimate
progression for NATO, given five of the eight internationally recognized
Arctic states are members of NATO. To be certain, NATO could wield
immense multilateral authority in a region which is strategically
important to Euro-Atlantic security.5 Ultimately, NATO's defense and
deterrence capabilities provide the most compelling justification for it
to counter Russia's expansive militarization efforts in the Arctic,
enabling it to strengthen the region's rules-based order. [[For NATO,
"Russian]{.mark} [**militarization** risks transforming Arctic
**relations**]{.mark}, and \[the alliance\] will not want to be left
**unprepared**]{.underline}."6 [[In this case, **diplomacy** may prove
**ineffective** and legal **ambiguity** could incentivize Russian
**revisionism**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The "iceberg" of Russia's]{.mark} Arctic
[policies]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Much of the **rationale** behind [Russia's]{.mark} domestic [**Arctic
policies** can be **traced** to the Kremlin's]{.mark} [underlying
economic and military **insecurities**]{.mark}. But the nature of its
concerns has resulted in a somewhat contradictory approach to the
region]{.underline}.

Back in 2014, political scientist Marlène Laruelle [**observed** that
[Russia's Arctic strategy was shaped by a]{.mark} "[competition between
**military** and **economic** agendas]{.mark}]{.underline}". [The
military logic [pushed]{.mark} the Kremlin towards significant
[**defence** investments and a **revival** of the Soviet-style approach
to]{.mark} the Arctic as an [exclusive **region** resistant to
**involvement**]{.mark} from foreign states and companies.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, the economic agenda emphasised civilian infrastructure and
improved living standards alongside an openness to foreign investment
and international cooperation in the Arctic.

In recent years, however, [the Kremlin has increasingly reframed the
economic agenda as a national security issue. [Russian strategic
documents]{.mark} now [describe the Arctic as both a guarantor of the
country's "**sovereignty and territorial integrity**" and a "**strategic
resource base**]{.mark}," while challenges like **depopulation** and
**infrastructure gaps** are redefined as security risks]{.underline}. In
2023, Putin echoed this logic by labelling Arctic development as
essential for energy expansion, logistics and national defence.

Despite this, tensions persist between the two logics and those
responsible for implementing them. As one of our respondents, involved
in implementing Russian Arctic policy since 2015, explained "the two
teams still work separately".\[2\] And this reference to "teams" is
important.

[Russian [policymaking functions through informal patronal networks
rather than formal institutions]{.mark}, meaning the **major policy
directions** are typically "assigned" by Putin to trusted
**allies**.]{.underline} In some spheres, the president encourages these
elites to compete in framing issues as security threats to gain
resources and influence; a process Russian political sociologist Simon
Kordonsky has aptly termed a "market of threats."

Despite the complex ecosystem of competing stakeholders, Russia's Arctic
policy has crystallised around two core agendas, each rooted in a
distinct Kremlin insecurity and advanced by a separate elite "team"
operating under Putin's mandate. The economic agenda---focused on
economic development and resource extraction---is overseen by Yury
Trutnev, deputy prime minister and longtime presidential envoy to the
Far Eastern Federal District. The military agenda---centred on security
and naval power projection---is handled by Nikolay Patrushev, former
secretary of the security council and now chair of the maritime
collegium under the president.

The two teams compete not just for resources and influence but for
ideological dominance: the pro-economic logic requires international
trade and cooperation, while the militaristic side is protective and
inherently anti-Western. In a Darwinian-like struggle, the results of
this competition form the full-scope of Russia's Arctic strategy, which
we will term its "policy iceberg".

[Trutnev's economic agenda forms the visible tip of the iceberg. It is
highly publicised by state media and Russian officials to project the
appearance of a cooperative, development-driven strategy. Patrushev's
[**security-oriented** and **military agenda**]{.mark}, by contrast, is
the submerged part of the iceberg. It [is barely **perceptible** beyond
officials fear-mongering]{.mark}, imperialist statements [but crucial to
Moscow's **geopolitical ambitions** in the region]{.mark}. And, as the
wrecks that litter the Arctic seabed attest, it is the ice beneath the
surface that poses the greatest threat.]{.underline}

3\) Extended deterrence through presence

As recalled in the DoD Arctic strategy, [[Arctic]{.mark}-specific
integrated [deterrence]{.mark} against existing regional threats
[**must** be **accomplished** through more physical
presence]{.mark}]{.underline}.50 For the US, this takes the form of
joint operations with NATO and allies as well as regular exercises,
especially naval drills, across circumpolar geography.118

Increasing the scope and range of missions of the UK-led Joint
Expeditionary Force would also represent a valuable step forward as it
would offer the European High North a high readiness force in the
Arctic. In a NATO context, [[the **alliance** must deepen]{.mark} the
range of [**Arctic-specific** drills]{.mark}, not least [to]{.mark}
bridge the operational learning curve in **circumpolar operations** ---
with the caveat of **[find]{.mark}**ing [the]{.mark} appropriate
[balance between sufficient **presence** and **over-militarizing** the
region]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The idea of forward presence for extended deterrence is not Arctic
specific. What makes it "Arctic" in essence is the need to uphold
international law by demonstrating continued access and innocent passage
through potentially contested bodies of water. Deterrence through the
protection of freedom of navigation in the Arctic under the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is at the heart of the
US NSAR.119

The concept of freedom of navigation, however, is feeding Russia's
obsessive quest for control over Arctic waters in the AZRF and access
beyond. Indeed, Russia persists in interpreting the NSR as a body of
"internal waters" under Article 234 of UNCLOS (also known as the Ice
Clause). Under the impact of climate change and seasonal sea-ice
reduction, the issue is that ice coverage is no longer guaranteed,
threatening the viability of the Ice Clause. The first successful
Russian passage of energy vessels through the NSR without icebreaker
escort in September 2023 is a case in point.120

For the past few years, [[**Moscow's** rhetoric has been]{.mark}
particularly [aggressive toward]{.mark} purported
Western-led]{.underline} freedom of navigation operations
([[FONOPs]{.underline}]{.mark}) --- [[with the US and NATO seeking to
"storm"]{.mark}121 or "snatch"122 [the NSR]{.mark} from the Kremlin's
control.]{.underline} Naval forces and the FSB alike are also adapting
training and capabilities to counter perceived "aggressive action from
other countries."123 The US NSAR and DoD strategy were undoubtedly pored
over in Russia, where propaganda outlets have been denouncing Western
efforts at "deciding the region's future by force"124 or "inviting
confrontation"125 in the Arctic.

[Moscow's FONOP [**paranoia** reached a new high]{.mark} when the
Kremlin went to great lengths to protect its perceived Arctic interests
through **legal means**. [Russia passed a law]{.mark} in December 2022
[updating]{.mark} the [NSR legal status]{.mark} and rights of transit
overtly restricting foreign flag navigation through the Kara
Gate]{.underline}, the Vilkitsky Strait by Severnaya Zemlya, and the
Sannikov Strait by the East Siberian Islands.126 [Closing **navigation**
through specific NSR choke points represents an attempt to preempt
potential foreign FONOPs.127 Such legal **changes** also represent
highly discriminatory rules that go against UNCLOS]{.underline}.

[[Regardless of]{.underline}]{.mark} actual [Western
**[intentions]{.mark}**, [the Kremlin is adamant]{.mark}]{.underline}
(or has self-constructed the belief) [that its contested
**interpretation** of [the NSR's status]{.mark} under the Ice Clause
[will]{.mark} soon [be tested by the **US** or **NATO**]{.mark} through
the organization of a FONOP]{.underline}. This would arguably take the
form of a NATO or US naval operation trying to sail through contested
choke points along the NSR, or naval assets breaching the December 2022
law to ascertain innocent passage and freedom of navigation under
UNCLOS.

The Arctic 7 must be careful to avoid a "FONOP vicious circle" where
tit-for-tat demonstrations of access would become routine, with the risk
of increasing incidents.82 [[The]{.mark} current [situation
**represents** a unique risk of Arctic **miscalculation**]{.mark} that
the Arctic 7 will have to carefully monitor. Indeed, conducting a US- or
NATO-led **FONOP** in the Arctic --- let alone close to the AZRF --
carries costs. Conversely, [**inaction** would **vindicate** Russia's
belief that the **NSR** represents an ice-covered **internal body of
water**]{.mark}.]{.underline}128

#### Arctic hybrid tactics are [essential]{.underline} to Russia power projection.

The Issue

The Evolution of Threats to Undersea Infrastructure in Northern Europe

[The war in [Ukraine has radically altered]{.mark} the threat landscape
across [Europe]{.mark}, particularly in the north. As the alliance
remains focused on supporting Ukraine and shoring up its eastern flank,
[Sweden's and Finland's membership bids will provide new opportunities
to deter Russian]{.mark} [aggression in the]{.mark} Baltic and
[**Arctic** regions]{.mark}]{.underline}. But recent examples of CUI
interference highlight vulnerabilities that will not be easily remedied.
The sabotage of two Nord Stream pipelines off the Danish island of
Bornholm in September 2022 forced European governments to grapple with
their limited ability to deter and defend against hybrid tactics in the
undersea domain.\[4\] Recent damage to the Balticconnector gas pipeline
and a data cable between Finland and Estonia in October 2023 from a
ship's anchor is suspected as being deliberate, although attribution has
not yet been declared.\[5\]

In this context, the main focus of critical maritime infrastructure
debates has shifted from emphasis on terrorism and cyber threats toward
the increasing frequency and efficacy of hybrid tactics.\[6\] The aim of
hybrid tactics is to cause significant damage to an adversary while
operating below the threshold of detection, attribution, and
response---and in so doing blur the conceptual lines between conflict
and peace.\[7\] The issue is compounded in the maritime realm by several
conceptual and practical challenges, mainly related to poor definitions
highly dependent on moral or political choices, a unique geophysical
space, and the multitude of potential threats.\[8\]

[[Russian hybrid tactics represent the most pressing threat to]{.mark}
CUI in northern [Europe]{.mark}. [Russia's war against Ukraine has
**debilitated** its ground forces]{.mark} and strained its **military
industrial base.** Experts estimate it will take the Kremlin five to ten
years to reconstitute its military]{.underline}.\[9\] Meanwhile,
however, [[Russia's power projection capabilities in northern
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}---through naval, air, and missile bases in
Kaliningrad and its Northern Fleet of submarines on the Kola
Peninsula---[[have scarcely been **depleted**]{.mark}. In fact, [while
the Russian navy is **underfunded** and a large part of its fleet
comprises Soviet legacy platforms, its underwater **capacity** continues
to grow]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[10\] In particular, Russia's submarine
program remains a priority amid other military budget cuts, exemplified
by the Kremlin's authorization of 13 new nuclear and conventional
submarines since 2014. In broader terms, [[Russia's ability to target
critical infrastructure short of war and impose economic costs to deter
external intervention]{.mark} in regional conflicts [is an important
**component** to Moscow's **doctrine** and thinking on **escalation
management**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[11\]

However, even in the absence of a broader Russia-NATO conflict, hybrid
tactics have been a staple in the Kremlin's toolbox in Europe for years.
[As the Kremlin views itself in perpetual conflict with the West,
[**hybrid tactics** are instrumental to **challenging NATO** without
resorting to **conventional military means**]{.mark}.\[]{.underline}12\]
Russia has likely targeted critical infrastructure throughout Europe at
an increased frequency since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\[13\]
In the undersea domain, Russia appears committed to mapping and
threatening European energy and communications infrastructure,
particularly strategically important Norwegian gas pipelines and
fiber-optic cables.\[14\]

[[Understand the **Arctic** as a bargaining chip in the **Kremlin's
wider geopolitical strategy**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Moscow is increasingly linking its **[Arctic diplomacy]{.mark}** to its
broader war-and-peace calculus on Ukraine.]{.underline} [[Early signs of
US attempts to broker a political resolution]{.mark} to the war [have
reignited the Kremlin's hopes for a "grand bargain", in which **symbolic
Arctic concessions**]{.mark}]{.underline}---such as downplaying Chinese
involvement or reengaging with Western formats---[[could be exchanged
for more **substantive gains** in Ukraine and
beyond.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Europeans must be ready for this tactic and avoid mistaking performative
gestures for real policy shifts. In particular, the Kremlin is likely to
court Western---especially American---interest in selective Arctic
cooperation, using promises of investment access to seek sanctions
relief. [[Even if Washington engages, European leaders should remain
firm and sceptical of such overtures and remind Trump that **illusions**

## Impact

### NATO cohesion good - general

**Allied [cohesion]{.underline} builds [consensus]{.underline} that is
critical to [successfully]{.underline} executing NATOs agenda to solve

NATO's climate security agenda [[Climate change]{.mark} has long been
known as [a **threat multiplier**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and is
increasingly recognised as a "[shaping
threat](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2021/11/us-cant-compete-china-without-tackling-climate-change/186543/)]{.underline}"
[[that **dramatically alters**]{.mark} the
[environments]{.mark}]{.underline} in which Allied militaries will have
to operate in the coming decades. [From **higher frequency and intensity
of storms**, through **extreme heat and cold**, to reduced supplies of
drinking water and faster wear and tear of military
equipment]{.underline}, climate change has [[significant
implications]{.underline}](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/04/01/nato-is-responding-to-new-challenges-posed-by-climate-change/index.html)
for NATO on the tactical, operational and strategic levels. In addition
to climate-related risks to military infrastructure and force readiness,
[**more extreme weather events** can also **increase conflict** and
migration potential in and beyond NATO's immediate
neighbourhood.]{.underline}

Born of the Cold War and designed to defend its members against any
external aggression, [[NATO is evolving to reflect]{.mark} the new
security [reality]{.mark} [of [**actorless
threats**](https://climate-security-expert-network.org/sites/climate-security-expert-network.org/files/documents/csen_risk_brief_arctic.pdf)]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}
such as **[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[biod]{.mark}iversity
loss]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[climate
change]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As a security organisation, NATO cannot
be indifferent to these challenges. For NATO to be able to fulfil its
core mission of keeping the Euro-Atlantic space safe, building
resilience to the impacts of a changing climate and integrating
sustainable practices into military planning and capability development
is a necessity, not a choice.

**[[Evolving consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}** The good news is that the
Alliance is not starting from scratch. For over 50 years now, NATO has
been paying attention to environmental challenges, mostly through a wide
range of scientific research activities. NATO has also developed [[six
environmental protection
standards]{.underline}](https://natolibguides.info/Environment/NATO-Documents) (STANAGs)
that concern military camps, management of waste, and sustainability of
military training areas. Climate change was written into the 2010
Strategic Concept and has been factored into summit declarations since
then. In 2014, NATO adopted a Green Defence Framework and integrated
energy efficiency and other environmental considerations into the design
of the current NATO headquarters, which was completed in 2018.
[The [[building
blocks]{.mark}](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_91048.htm) for
a more **ambitious and visible** role with respect to **climate
security** [are]{.mark} already [there]{.mark}.]{.underline}

However, [[NATO]{.mark} as an alliance of 30 countries [**works by
consensus**, which is **always evolving**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a
former UN Special Envoy on Climate Change, Jens Stoltenberg began
advocating for NATO to take greater climate-related action many years
ago, but his efforts may have
been [[stymied]{.underline}](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/nato-chief-armies-must-keep-pace-with-global-climate-efforts-2021-11-02/) during
the previous U.S. administration. The [[growing number of climate and
weather related
disasters]{.underline}](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/09/1098662),
which continue to impact lives and livelihoods both within and outside
of NATO's borders, has marked an [[evident shift in]{.underline}]{.mark}
awareness and acceptance of [[climate]{.mark} change [as an **issue of
national**]{.mark} **[security]{.mark}** across the Alliance. [In view
of]{.mark}]{.underline} increasing societal pressure and the current
political momentum, which includes the **[[renewed U.S.]{.mark}

is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[poised to]{.underline}]{.mark} push [a

It is true that Xi's China has, in the last few years, taken a more
overtly hostile stance against the United States and that China's
astounding military growth, pursuit of global domination, geopolitical
expansionism, and extreme human rights abuses intensified during that
time. In the year 2022, it is reasonable to prioritize the China threat.
But re-pivoting to China was a mistake, for Russia and China both
threaten the security of the free world and the stability of the
democratic project. [It would be **foolhardy** to **underestimate** the
Russian threat, for [Russia is on]{.mark} the [**warpath**, and]{.mark}
Russia [has]{.mark} a **[great]{.mark} military [capability]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **sophisticated [tools]{.mark}** [of **hybrid
warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps the most trenchant fact is that
[Putin has **time and again** demonstrated his determination to use
Russian power [to **fulfill**]{.mark} his **[revanchist
ambitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Right now, [Russia is the **most
actively [menacing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, effectual [**threat** to the
**[U.S.-led order]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee Mike Turner asserts
that, with the predominance Russia has achieved in Kaliningrad, Syria,
and Crimea, Russia has created an "area of access and denial even
greater than it had with the Warsaw Pact in the Soviet days." [With
**aggressive** naval and air exercises and the **co-opting** of
**ports**, Russia is **positioned** to **intimidate international
shipping** and **aircraft**.]{.underline} Ukraine recently issued a
formal protest against Russia's partial blockade of the Black Sea and
the Sea of Azov, which makes navigation in both seas "virtually
impossible." Noting how little the West has done to forestall this
eventuality, Peter Dickinson of the Atlantic Council observes, "Moscow's
latest Black Sea gambit comes following years of escalating Russian
interference targeting Ukrainian merchant shipping in the nearby Sea of
Azov. Ever since the completion of the Crimean Bridge connecting the
Russian-occupied Ukrainian peninsula with the Russian mainland, the
Kremlin has introduced an expanding range of restrictions on Ukrainian
and international vessels using ports along southeastern Ukraine's Azov
Sea coastline."

With Russia's malign military campaign against Ukraine finally receiving
due attention, [we must not forget Putin's broader ambitions. [Russia
aggressively]{.mark} targets [**Poland** and]{.mark} the [**Baltics**
with **propaganda**]{.mark} and **cyber operations**, has turned
[**Belarus** into]{.mark} a **[puppet]{.mark} state**]{.underline} and
front in the war against Ukraine, [[influences **Georgia**]{.mark}
through the occupation of **[Abkhazia]{.mark}** and **[South
Ossetia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, uses energy blackmail against Moldova
and other countries, [and installed "peacekeeping" forces to
**[exploit]{.mark} tensions** between **[Armenia]{.mark}** and
**[Azerbaijan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, ultimately ending the conflict on
Putin's terms. [Russia has pressured **Bosnia**, **Kosovo**,
**Moldova**, **Macedonia**, **Lithuania**, **Latvia**, **Estonia**,
**Kazakhstan**, and **Montenegro**]{.underline} both [politically and
militarily [and]{.mark} has **[repeatedly violated]{.mark} Baltic
[airspace]{.mark}** with Russian warplanes]{.underline}. Putin seeks to
subvert the West's pro-democracy agenda whenever there is an opening ---
and there is often an opening.

[Russia's **imperial [designs]{.mark}** clearly already [extend way
beyond **Ukraine**, and]{.mark} way beyond
**[Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. China and Russia wasted no time
capitalizing on the United States's precipitous and ill-begotten
Afghanistan withdrawal. [[In]{.mark} the **[Middle East]{.mark}**,
Russia [pursues **destabilizing arms sales**, cultivates]{.mark}
paramilitary groups and **sectarian [conflict]{.mark}**, and seeks
permanent military bases. [In]{.mark} the **[Arctic]{.mark}**, Russia
has [built]{.mark} military [bases]{.mark} and conducts numerous patrol
and training operations]{.underline}. Then [[there are]{.mark} Russia's
**increasingly [overt attempts]{.mark}**]{.underline}, often in tandem
with China, [[to prop up **anti-American dictators**]{.mark} in the
**Western Hemisphere**, especially **Maduro** in **Venezuela**,
**Ortega** in **Nicaragua**, and **Castro** and **Diaz-Canel** in
**Cuba**. Russia's **shadowy paramilitary** "**Wagner Group**" operates

in **Mali**]{.underline}

As a consequence, [[Moscow's actions]{.mark} in foreign, security and
defense policy have been [designed to **restore Russia's great power
status**]{.mark}]{.underline} while at the same time re-establishing the
cordon sanitaire it enjoyed until the end of the Cold War. In
particular, [it wants to regain control of Russia's "near abroad,"
making demands for an allegedly historically justified "zone of
privileged interest]{.underline}." This would come [**at the expense**
of the **sovereignty and security** of neighboring states]{.underline}.
While Russia's [actions]{.underline} may have defensive origins, these
insecurities [are [manifested in]{.mark} an [**aggressive** and
**unpredictable** manner.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

[[**Standing in the way** of Russia's]{.mark} expansionist [ambitions
are the **EU and NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[and
**above**]{.mark} **[all]{.mark}** [the]{.mark}
**[U.S]{.mark}.**]{.underline} military presence in Europe. [[If **NATO
unity** were **sufficiently undermined**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[its

[[ability to defend]{.mark} itself **[undercut]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[the **organization itself**]{.mark} **[could
collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Were that to happen, [[**Russia would
gain control** over an open field]{.underline}]{.mark}; the
[[expansion]{.mark} of Russian control over Europe [would be]{.mark}
**almost [automatic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is why
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is seeking to undermine the Euro-Atlantic
security order that emerged after the Cold War: its [[goal is to weaken
NATO]{.mark} and the European Union (EU), **[disrupting]{.mark} Western
[initiatives]{.mark}** [and **regional and global
arrangements**]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

**That guarantees the [collapse]{.underline} of the global order and
[extinction]{.underline}.**

Despite these reflections, in February 2022 I was shocked when Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} tried to conquer Ukraine. The expected
repercussions for Russia itself, and for the whole of humanity, were so
destructive that it seemed an unlikely move even for a coldhearted
megalomaniac. Yet the Russian autocrat [chose to end the most peaceful
era in human history, and]{.underline} to [push humanity toward a new
era of war that might be worse than **anything we have seen
before**]{.underline}. Indeed, [it might [threaten the **very survival
of our species.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

This is a tragedy, especially as the past few decades have shown that
war isn't an inevitable force of nature. It is a human choice that
varies from place to place and time to time. Since 1945, we have not
seen a single case of war between great powers, nor a single case of an
internationally recognized state annihilated through foreign conquest.
More limited regional and local conflicts remained relatively common; I
live in Israel, so I know this perfectly well. But the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank notwithstanding, countries have rarely tried
to unilaterally expand their borders through violence. That's one reason
the Israeli occupation has drawn so much attention and criticism. What
was the norm for thousands of years of imperial history has become
anathema.

Even when taking civil wars, insurgencies, and terrorism into account,
in recent decades wars have killed far fewer people than suicide, road
accidents, or obesity-related diseases. In 2019, about 70,000 people
were killed in armed conflicts or police shootings, about 700,000 people
committed suicide, 1.3 million people died in road accidents, and 1.5
million people died from diabetes.

Yet peace has not been just a matter of numbers. Perhaps the most
important change in recent decades has been psychological. For thousands
of years, peace meant "the temporary absence of war." For example, in
between the three Punic Wars fought by Rome and Carthage were decades of
peace, but every Roman and Carthaginian knew that this "Punic Peace"
could be shattered at any moment. Politics, economics, and culture were
all shaped by constant expectations of war.

During the late 20th century and early 21st century, the meaning of the
word peace changed. Whereas the Old Peace meant only "the temporary
absence of war," the New Peace came to mean "the implausibility of war."
In many (though not all) regions of the world, countries stopped fearing
that their neighbors might invade and annihilate them. Tunisians stopped
dreading an Italian invasion, Costa Ricans didn't think that the
Nicaraguan army might make a dash to San José, and Samoans didn't fear
that a Fijian war fleet might suddenly emerge from beyond the horizon.
How can we tell that countries weren't concerned about these things? By
looking at their state budgets.

Until recently, the military was the expected No. 1 item on the budget
of every empire, sultanate, kingdom, and republic. Governments spent
little on health care and education, because most of their resources
went to paying soldiers, constructing walls, and building warships. The
Roman Empire spent about 50 to 75 percent of its budget on the military;
the figure was about 80 percent in the Sung Empire (960--1279); and
about 60 percent in the late-17th-century Ottoman Empire. From 1685 to
1813, the share of the military in British government expenditure never
fell below 55 percent and averaged 75 percent. During the great
conflicts of the 20th century, democracies and totalitarian regimes
alike plunged into debt to finance their machine guns, tanks, and
submarines. When we fear that the neighbors might at any moment invade,
loot our cities, enslave our people, and annex our land, that's the
reasonable thing to do.

State budgets in the era of the New Peace make for far more hopeful
reading material than any pacifist tract ever composed. In the early
21st century, the average government expenditure on the military has
been [[only 6.5
percent]{.underline}](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.ZS?end=2020&start=1988&view=chart),
and even the United States, the dominant superpower, has spent only
about [[11
percent]{.underline}](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.ZS?end=2020&locations=US&start=1988&view=chart) to
maintain its supremacy. Because people no longer lived in terror of
external invasion, governments could invest far more money in health
care, welfare, and education than in the military. Average expenditure
on health care, for example, has been 10.5 percent of the government
budget, or about 1.6 times the defense budget. For many people today,
the fact that the health-care budget is bigger than the military budget
is unremarkable. But if we take the New Peace for granted and therefore
neglect it, we will soon lose it.

The new peace was the outcome of three main forces. First, technological
changes, and above all the development of nuclear weapons, greatly
increased the price of war, especially between superpowers. The atomic
bomb turned superpower war into a mad act of collective suicide, which
is why superpowers have not gone to war directly against one another
since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Secondly, economic changes greatly decreased the profits of war. Key
economic assets were once material resources that could be conquered by
force. When Rome defeated Carthage in the Punic Wars, it became rich by
looting its defeated rival, selling its people into slavery, and taking
over the silver mines of Spain and the wheat fields of North Africa. In
recent decades, however, scientific, technical, and organizational
knowledge have become the most important economic assets in many places.
Silicon Valley has no silicon mines. Trillion-dollar businesses such as
Microsoft and Google are built on what's in the minds of engineers and
entrepreneurs rather than what's in the ground under their feet. And
whereas seizing silver mines by force is easy, you cannot acquire
knowledge that way. This economic reality led to a sharp decline in the
profitability of conquest.

Although wars over material resources continue to characterize certain
parts of the world---such as the Middle East---the big economies of the
post-1945 period grew without imperial conquest. Germany, Japan, and
Italy saw their armies broken and their territories shrink---but after
the war, their economies boomed. The Chinese economic miracle was
achieved without engaging in any major war since 1979.

As I was writing these lines in early November, Russian soldiers were
looting the Ukrainian city of Kherson, sending back to Russia trucks
full of carpets and toasters that they'd stolen from Ukrainian homes.
This will not make Russia rich, and it will not compensate the Russians
for the enormous cost of the war. But as Putin's invasion of Ukraine
proves, technological and economic changes by themselves were not enough
to produce the New Peace. Some leaders are so power-hungry and so
irresponsible that they might begin a war even if it is economically
ruinous to their country and pushes the whole of humanity toward nuclear
Armageddon. Accordingly, the third essential pillar of the New Peace has
been cultural and institutional.

Human societies were long dominated by militaristic cultures that viewed
war as inevitable, and even desirable. Aristocrats in both Rome and
Carthage believed that military glory was life's crowning achievement
and the ideal route to power and riches. Artists such as Virgil and
Horace concurred, devoting their talents to singing of arms and
warriors, glorifying bloody battles, and immortalizing brutal
conquerors. During the New Peace era, artists turned their talents to
exposing the horrors of war, while politicians sought to leave their
mark by initiating health-care reforms rather than by looting foreign
cities. Leaders throughout the world---influenced by the fear of nuclear
war, by the changes in the nature of the economy, and by new cultural
trends---joined forces to build a functioning global order that allowed
countries to develop peacefully while restraining the occasional
warmongers.

This global order has been based on liberal ideals, namely, that all
humans deserve the same basic liberties; that no human group is
inherently superior to all others; and that all humans share core
experiences, values, and interests. These ideals encouraged leaders to
avoid war and instead work together to protect our common values and to
advance our common interests. The liberal global order linked the belief
in universal values to the peaceful functioning of global institutions.

Although this global order was far from perfect, it improved the lives
of people not just in the old imperial centers such as Britain and the
United States, but also in many other parts of the world, from India to
Brazil and from Poland to China. Countries in all continents benefited
from the rise in global trade and investments, and almost all countries
enjoyed a peace dividend. Not only could Denmark and Canada shift
resources from tanks to teachers---Nigeria and Indonesia did the same.

Anyone who rants about the defects of the liberal global order should
first answer one simple question: Can you please name the decade in
which humankind was in better shape than in the 2010s? Which decade is
your lost golden age? Is it the 1910s, with the First World War, the
Bolshevik Revolution, Jim Crow, and European empires brutally exploiting
much of Africa and Asia? Is it perhaps the 1810s, with the Napoleonic
Wars reaching their bloody climax, Russian and Chinese peasants crushed
by their aristocratic overlords, the East India Company securing its
control of India, and slavery still legal in the United States, Brazil,
and most other parts of the world? Perhaps you are dreaming of the
1710s, with the War of the Spanish Succession, the Great Northern War,
the Mughal succession wars, and a third of children everywhere dying
from malnutrition and disease before reaching adulthood?

The new peace didn't result from some divine miracle. It was achieved by
humans making better choices and building a functioning global order.
Unfortunately, too many people took this achievement for granted.
Perhaps they assumed that the New Peace was guaranteed mainly by
technological and economic forces, and that it could survive even
without its third pillar---the liberal global order. Consequently, that
order was first neglected and then attacked with growing ferocity.

The attack started with rogue states such as Iran and rogue leaders such
as Putin, but by themselves, they were not strong enough to end the New
Peace. What really undermined the global order was that both the
countries that benefited most from it (including China, India, Brazil,
and Poland) and the countries that built it in the first place (notably
the U.K. and the United States) turned their backs on it. The Brexit
vote and the election of Donald Trump in 2016 symbolized this turn.

Those who have challenged the global liberal order mostly didn't wish
for war. They just wanted to advance what they understood as the
interests of their country, and they argued that each nation-state
should defend and develop its own sacred identity and traditions. What
they never explained was how all of these different nations would deal
with one another in the absence of universal values and global
institutions. The opponents of the global order did not offer any clear
alternative. They seemed to think that somehow, the various nations
would just get along fine, and the world would become a network of
walled-but-friendly fortresses.

Fortresses are seldom friendly, however. Each national fortress usually
wants a bit more land, security, and prosperity for itself at the
expense of its neighbors, and without the help of universal values and
global institutions, rival fortresses cannot agree on any common rules.
The network-of-fortresses model was a recipe for disaster.

And disaster was not long in coming. The pandemic demonstrated that in
the absence of effective global cooperation, humanity cannot protect
itself against common threats such as viruses. Then, perhaps because he
observed how COVID further eroded global solidarity, Putin concluded
that he could mete out the coup de grâce by breaking the biggest taboo
of the New Peace era. Putin thought that if he conquered Ukraine and
absorbed it into Russia, some countries would gasp in disbelief and
condemn him---but nobody would take any effective action against him.

The argument that Putin was pushed unwillingly to invade Ukraine to
preempt a Western attack is nonsensical propaganda. Some vague Western
threat is not a legitimate excuse for destroying a country, looting its
cities, raping and torturing its citizens, and inflicting untold
suffering on tens of millions of men, women, and children. Anyone who
believes that Putin had no choice should name the country that was
preparing to invade Russia in 2022. Do you think the German army was
massing to cross the border? Do you imagine that Napoleon got out of his
grave to lead the Grande Armée yet again to Moscow, and Putin had no
choice but to preempt the imminent French onslaught? And remember that
Putin actually first invaded Ukraine back in 2014---not in 2022.

Putin prepared his invasion for a long time. He never accepted the
breakup of the Russian Empire, and he never saw Ukraine, Georgia, or any
of the other post-Soviet republics as legitimate independent nations.
Whereas---as noted earlier---average military expenses have been about
6.5 percent of government budgets around the world and 11 percent in the
United States, in Russia they have been far higher. We don't know
exactly how much higher, because it is a state secret. But estimates put
the figure somewhere in the vicinity of 20 percent, and it may even be
more than 30 percent.

[[If Putin]{.mark}'s gamble **[succeeds]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
[the [result will be]{.mark} the **[final collapse of the global
order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and of the New Peace.]{.underline}
[**[Autocrats around the world]{.underline}** [will
learn]{.underline}]{.mark} [that [**wars of conquest** are]{.mark} again
[possible]{.mark}, and **[democracies]{.mark}**, too, [will]{.mark} be
**forced to [militarize]{.mark}** themselves for protection. We've
already seen Russian aggression prompt countries such as Germany
to]{.underline} sharply [increase their defense budget overnight, and
countries such as Sweden to reinstate conscription]{.underline}. [The
money that should go to teachers, nurses, and social workers will
instead go to tanks, missiles, and cyberweapons]{.underline}. At 18,
young people all over the world will do their mandatory military
service. **[The [whole world will look like
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**---a country with an oversize army and
understaffed hospitals. [A new era of [**war**, **poverty**,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[disease]{.underline}** [will
result]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**[Alternatively]{.underline}**, [if Putin
is]{.underline} **[stopped]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and
punished]{.underline}**, [[the global order]{.mark} **won't be broken**
by what he did]{.underline}---[it [will be
**strengthened**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Anyone who needed a **reminder**
would rediscover that **you just cannot do these things.**]{.underline}

[Which of these]{.underline} two [scenarios will materialize? Luckily
for everyone, despite his military preparations, Putin was disastrously
unprepared]{.underline} for one crucial thing: the courage of the
Ukrainian people. [The Ukrainians have pushed back the Russians in a
series of stunning victories near Kyiv]{.underline}, Kharkiv, and
Kherson. But Putin has so far refused to acknowledge his mistake, and he
reacts to defeat with increased brutality. Seeing that his army cannot
overcome the Ukrainian soldiers on the front line, Putin is now trying
to freeze the Ukrainian civilians to death in their homes. Predicting
how the war will end is impossible, as is the fate of the New Peace.

History is never deterministic. After the end of the Cold War, many
people thought that peace was inevitable, and that it would continue
even if we neglected the global order. After Russia invaded Ukraine,
some swung to the opposite view. They claimed that peace had always been
just an illusion, that war was an ungovernable force of nature, and that
the only choice humans had was whether they wanted to be prey or
predator. Both positions are wrong. [War and peace are
decisions]{.underline}, [not inevitabilities. Wars are made by people,
not by a law of nature]{.underline}. And [just as humans make wars,
humans can also make peace]{.underline}. But to make peace is not a
one-off decision. It's a long-term effort to protect universal norms and
values, and to build cooperative institutions. [Rebuilding the global
order doesn't mean going back to the system that disintegrated in the
2010s]{.underline}. A new and better global order should give more
important roles to non-Western powers that are willing to be part of it.
It should also recognize the salience of national loyalties. The global
order disintegrated above all because of the assault of populist forces,
which argued that patriotic loyalties contradict global cooperation.
Populist politicians preached that if you are a patriot, you must oppose
global institutions and global cooperation. But there is no inherent
contradiction between patriotism and globalism, because patriotism isn't
about hating foreigners. Patriotism is about loving your compatriots.
And [in the 21st century]{.underline}, **[[if you want to
protect]{.mark} your compatriots]{.underline}** [[from]{.underline}
**[war]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[pandemic]{.underline}**[,
[and]{.underline} **[ecological collapse]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [the
[best way]{.mark} to do that is [by]{.mark}
**[cooperating]{.mark}**]{.underline} with foreigners.

Russian Performance and NATO Action Russia has long-standing expertise
in the use of hostile measures. However, its success in applying these
measures has been uneven, and its capabilities have been somewhat
overstated. Russia applies hostile measures expertly but generally not
in a way that helps it sustain a favorable status quo in Europe. Our
historical analysis and case studies suggest that Russia is tactically
competent but strategically shortsighted (or at least insufficient to
thwart NATO). The Soviet Union's many local, short-term successes in the
gray zone did not generate dominant global communism or prevent the
collapse of the Soviet state. **[NATO]{.underline}** [has more than

[Table S.2 summarizes our assessment of Russia's success rate in each of

measures achieve a desired effect? Did they slow, stop, or punish a
perceived hostile action or gain Russia an immediate tactical advantage
in the target area? • Strategic: Did the entirety of Russia's hostile
measures---its collective tactics---clearly generate a favorable,
long-term strategic change? In these cases, was long-term Western
influence stopped or rolled back, and did long-term Russian influence
increase? [We determined that [Russia]{.mark} achieved tactical success
in three]{.underline} [out of the five cases]{.underline} [but that it
[had **no definitive strategic success**]{.mark}]{.underline}: In every
case, it failed to prevent former Soviet states or clients from moving
ever closer to the West. It sometimes delayed but did not stop progress
toward NATO accession. In three cases, Russia's strategic success
backfired: The victims of its hostile measures accelerated their
westward shifts in response to Russia's behavior, NATO increased its
direct support for each state, and NATO and (in some cases) the European
Union reactively made firmer mutual commitments to support the defense
and development of the affected states. [Russia's]{.underline} genuine

hostile measures. If deterrence fails, it should seek to prevent Russia
from applying hostile measures. If Russia succeeds in applying hostile
measures, NATO should find ways to counter their efficacy. [For the

[[Pessimism regarding]{.mark} the defensibility of
[NATO's]{.mark}]{.underline} so-called [[northeastern flank
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[unwarranted]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To
begin with, [much of [the]{.mark} policy [literature]{.mark} on this
region [**concentrates on Russia's strengths** while **ignoring
its**]{.mark} **key [weaknesses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The Baltic
countries would almost surely lose set piece battles against Russia, but
[deterrence]{.mark} ultimately [hinges **less on**]{.mark} **[being
victorious]{.mark}** in a potential war [than]{.mark} on **[imposing
unacceptable costs]{.mark} on the adversary**]{.underline}. [[The Baltic
states have]{.underline}]{.mark} already [begun embracing
**[unconventional strategies]{.mark}** intended [to boost]{.mark}
national [resiliency]{.mark} and make occupation difficult]{.underline}
(Collins and Beehner 2019). [[Guerrilla tactics]{.mark} and territorial
defense [serve to augment]{.mark} their [denial capabilities]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} in turn [would **complicate Russian efforts** to hold
territory]{.mark} and pacify the local population]{.underline}.
Moreover, [[Russia]{.mark} may have **local escalation dominance**, but
it **[does not have global escalation dominance]{.mark}**, given the
forces that NATO members possess. [A large-scale land grab]{.mark} made
at the expense of any of the Baltic countries [might precipitate
**escalatory dynamics that it could not control.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
Nuclear war may be a remote possibility, but it cannot be discounted
altogether. [[One reason why Russia]{.mark} has [resorted
to]{.mark}]{.underline} so-called [**[hybrid tactics]{.underline}**
against]{.mark} the Baltic countries---such as political subversion and
eforts to foment unrest---[[is that]{.mark} [it does not wish to provoke
a reaction]{.mark}]{.underline} that it cannot handle (Lanoszka 2016).
Put simply, [**[Russia may believe in]{.mark} [NATO's Article
Five]{.mark} collective defense commitment [more than NATO]{.mark}
members themselves do.** Russia's ability to mount a major
assault]{.underline} on the Baltic littoral region [should not be
exaggerated]{.underline} either. [[Strategic assets]{.mark} [that
Russia]{.mark} supposedly [has]{.mark}]{.underline} at its disposal
**[[can become liabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Its]{.mark} one
[formal defense partner]{.mark}]{.underline}---Belarus---[has
[proved]{.mark} [reluctant to accept]{.mark} additional [forward
deployed military assets and]{.mark} to [provide]{.mark} diplomatic
[support]{.mark}]{.underline} in Russia's territorial disputes with its
neighbors. [Because Belarus has potentially much to lose from getting
involved in any sort of military confrontation]{.underline} between
Russia and NATO, [its leaders will be hesitant to offer material support
to Russia, **especially if they fear becoming the target** of NATO
countermeasures.]{.underline} Moreover, [[any]{.mark} massive [assault
on]{.mark} Poland and [the Baltic]{.mark} countries [would require
extensive stockpiling of]{.mark} military
[hardware]{.mark}]{.underline}, ammunition, medical equipment, and other
supplies, **[[which would provide NATO]{.mark} defense planners [with
early warning]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The Russian exclave of
[Kaliningrad might also be vulnerable. Swedish [researchers have called
into question Russian A2/AD]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline} located in
Kaliningrad and elsewhere, [alleging that [its missile systems
have]{.mark} **much [short]{.mark}er [ranges]{.mark}** than commonly
presumed [and]{.mark} [may be **vulnerable to
countermeasures**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dalsjö et al. 2019). [NATO
militaries]{.underline} like the Polish Armed Forces [could hold at risk
Kaliningrad. The question should]{.underline} not necessarily
[be]{.underline} whether the United States would trade 'Toledo for
Tallinn' but [whether Russia would trade Kaliningrad for
Vilnius]{.underline}. And indeed, [**[Russia would need the Suwałki Gap
as much as NATO]{.mark}** would because the area provides a bridge
between Belarus and Kaliningrad. [Attempts to close it]{.mark}
necessarily [involve **violating Poland's territorial integrity**
and]{.mark} would **[provide justification for NATO to
escalate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Partly because of these difficulties
associated with a major conventional attack]{.underline}, regional
**[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark}** and government officials [[**judge
the probability** of]{.mark} something of [this]{.mark} sort
**[happening to be low]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Lanoszka and Hunzeker
2019, 29--30, 79). That is not to say Russia is weak; for example, its
widening missile advantages still create gaps in NATO's deterrence
posture. But **[[Russia is not a military
juggernaut]{.underline}]{.mark}** either. Even the use of so-called
hybrid tactics may have limited efficacy in the Baltic region. The three
Baltic countries have been subject to an intense Russian disinformation
campaign since at least 2014. Nevertheless, local public opinion remains
largely supportive of NATO and other defense policy measures aimed at
boosting deterrence. One reason why these societies may be inoculated
against Russian disinformation is that they have grown accustomed to
seeing Russia in adversarial terms, thus making average citizens
critical of pro-Kremlin narratives (Lanoszka 2019). In addition, the
Baltic states have integrated their minority populations far better than
is often assumed. Although many Russophones may still lack citizenship
rights in Estonia and Latvia and so are more likely to experience
political discrimination and economic hardship, they nevertheless retain
key benefits associated with living in the European Union (Trimbach and
O'Lear 2015). They may have sympathies for aspects of Russian foreign
policy, but these sympathies do not translate into a preference to be
reunited with Russia (Kallas 2016). Accordingly, Russia faces serious
obstacles replicating what it did in Crimea. Russians living in Crimea
were generally sympathetic to being part of Russkiy Mir ('Russian
World'), making them more willing to be the objects of an annexation
efort (O'Loughlin, Toal, and Kolosov 2016, 761). Further, Russia does
not have an existing military presence in the Baltic countries---as it
did with the Black Sea Fleet stationed in Sevastopol---that it could
leverage to achieve easy faits accomplis and dissuade potential
challengers from organizing. In sum, [NATO does not need to have a heavy
footprint in the Baltic region to deter Russian aggression. [Russia
would]{.mark} [have to **overcome major operational challenges**]{.mark}
if it wished to undertake a successful conquest]{.underline} of the
Baltic countries. Of course, none of this is to invite complacency about
Baltic security. The Baltic states and Poland should deepen regional
cooperation in order to ensure that no key policy differences exist
between them (Jermalavicius et al. 2018). They also face potential
vulnerabilities at sea and so need to improve the resilience of their

[[The **Arctic** is insufficiently prioritized]{.mark} amidst the United
States' competing global interests]{.underline}. The future [battlefield
is melting [and demands US attention]{.mark}]{.underline}, as a
partnership between Russia and the People's Republic of China fuels
strategic competition in the Arctic. Thus, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} [[must adopt a proactive Arctic
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[working with]{.mark} its [NATO Allies
to ensure]{.mark} that [the Arctic remains]{.mark} stable and [free from
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} US's 2022 National
Defense Strategy ([NDS]{.underline}) outlines [that the **U**nited
**S**tates "seeks a stable Arctic region characterized by adherence to
internationally agreed upon rules and norms."1) To achieve a secure
Arctic, [the 2024]{.mark} Arctic [Strategy]{.mark}, produced by the U.S.
Department of Defense, [follows a "monitor-and-respond"]{.mark}
[approach]{.mark}. However, [this]{.mark} reactive strategy [is
**inadequate**]{.mark}.]{.underline}2)

[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} 2022 [[invasion of Ukraine
provides]{.underline}]{.mark} evidence [[that
Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} will not adhere to the current global order
and [[will continue to challenge Western]{.mark} **international
[norms]{.mark}** wherever possible, [**including** in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[NATO's growing
appeal]{.underline}]{.mark} among European states [[suggests
that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[NATO may]{.underline}]{.mark} also be called
upon to [[guarantee the future of **Arctic
stability**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead of dividing Europe, isolating
Ukraine, and expanding its influence, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has
resulted in a closer alliance between the United States and its Arctic
NATO allies. Moreover, NATO, with the accession of Finland and Sweden,
has expanded,, and now seven out of the eight Arctic nations are NATO
members. [[The **alliance** offers an opportunity]{.mark} for the United
States [to strengthen]{.mark} its position in [the **Arctic
region**]{.mark} while not having to go it alone]{.underline}.

A potential war zone

[The **[Arctic]{.mark}** has long been [a potential **arena**
for]{.mark}]{.underline} war, especially **[[nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. American and Russian
**[submarines]{.underline}** stationed there [[boast
**i**]{.underline}]{.mark}nter**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ontinental
**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**allisti**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**
missile[[s and]{.mark} act as strategic **nuclear
deterrents**]{.underline}. For Moscow, **[the [Kola]{.mark}
Peninsula]{.underline}** in Russia's far north-west [forms a [gateway
for]{.mark}]{.underline} vessels from its massive fleet of mainly
**[nuclear-powered [sub]{.mark}]{.underline}**marine[**[s]{.mark}**.
Through the]{.underline} so-called **[GIUK gap]{.underline}**, the gap
between Greenland, Iceland and the UK, [Russia's subs can **reach** the
**Atlantic**]{.underline}.

Should the Kremlin ever fire **[cruise [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}**
toward North America, they [would [fly **over the
Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Likewise, Canada and America's
**[[warning]{.mark} system]{.underline}**, stretching from Alaska to
Newfoundland and Labrador, [would [pick up]{.mark} the [attack
in]{.mark} the **[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And, partly to atone
for missing the Chinese surveillance balloon that reached Alaska in
January this year, [America and Canada are set to build]{.underline} new
[**Arctic**-scanning **radar bases**]{.underline} in the north-western
US and Ontario. The main aim of which will be to detect the new
hypersonic cruise missiles that Russia has already used in Ukraine and
could one day fire at Canada and America, via the North Pole.

The [[**Arctic** is]{.underline}]{.mark} also the [[site of]{.mark}
potential]{.underline} non-nuclear [[disputes between **Russia** and
**NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark} members. The Kremlin's feared 200th Motor
Rifle [**Brigade** is located only a **few kilometres** from
Russia's]{.underline} short **[border]{.underline}** with Norway and its
much longer one with Finland. Other Russian marines are also based in
the region, including the spetsnaz (special forces). Both units have
suffered severe losses in Ukraine, but their location and their likely
future revival continue to worry Norway. After all, over in Ukraine, at
least seven soldiers from the 200th Motor Rifle Brigade are wanted for
war crimes.

[There have [**already** been]{.mark}]{.underline} potential
**[[flashpoints]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When Moscow invaded Ukraine,
[**Norway** blocked Russian exports to]{.underline} Svalbard, [a
Norwegian **Arctic archipelago**]{.underline} with a population of just
2,600 -- including 400 Russians. That [led [Russia]{.mark} to
[threaten]{.mark}]{.underline} unspecified '**[[retaliatory
measures]{.underline}]{.mark}**'. Since then, Russo-Norwegian relations
have deteriorated still further. Indeed, northern Norway, home to nearly
500,000 people and a significant Russian-speaking minority,
is reportedly now a hotbed of Russian espionage. The presence of Russian
drones and spies, surveilling key Norwegian ports, as well as
fibre-optic cables and pipelines, indicates that the [Kremlin
is]{.underline} already [waging low-level **hybrid
warfare**]{.underline}.

New NATO member [**Finland** also has problems with
**Russia**]{.underline} that stretch into the **[Arctic]{.underline}**.
In November, Finland claimed that Moscow was using asylum seekers from
the Middle East and Africa to infiltrate its borders. It
promptly diverted them all to the remote Raja-Jooseppi border post, 300
kilometres north of the Arctic Circle. Finland has since announced that
it will shut down all border crossings with Russia.

The role of **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Arctic Circle [is
[also increasing **tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chinese
[**[investments]{.mark}** and
technologies [underpin **Russian**]{.mark}]{.underline} fossil-fuel
**[[extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}** and transport in the Arctic. And,
although **[China]{.underline}** has no land or sea claims on the
Arctic, it [declared itself a]{.underline} '**[Near-Arctic
State']{.underline}** in 2018, invoking the impact of changes in the
Arctic's ecology on China's own ecology.

The Arctic is not just some frozen, neglected backwater. [Everybody
wants in]{.underline}. And with that [[comes the risk of]{.mark} further
state-to-state [**disputes** and **conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**Trilateral tensions motivate [preemption]{.underline}, making

[Arctic security can be characterised as a nexus between]{.underline}
multipolar [**nuclear conflict** and **[climate]{.mark}
change**]{.underline}. Multipolarity is defined as a global balance of
power between multiple actors \[3\]. [Climate Change]{.underline} is
making seaways and resources more accessible, which [is [leading to a
thawing of]{.mark} **territorial [conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} which
were formerly frozen \[4\]. [[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} increasing
[**economic interests** in the Arctic means it must be considered as [a
**regional actor**]{.mark} despite its near-regional status]{.underline}
\[5\]. [[Russia]{.mark} has]{.underline} recently [[threatened to use
**nuc**]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon[**[s]{.mark}** against
the]{.underline} United States ([U.S.]{.underline}) due to its
objections to Russia's invasion of Ukraine; [this [sets a precedent
for]{.mark} **heightened [nuclear tension]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} is the most
nuclearized area in the world and [[has seen a]{.mark} **steady
[buildup]{.mark}** of nuclear and conventional forces]{.underline} by
regional actors \[6\]. [These [factors have led to]{.mark} **direct
[tensions]{.mark}** [between]{.mark}]{.underline} three major nuclear
actors (namely, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and **Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark})
in a region that is becoming increasingly competitive \[7\]. [These
tensions [cannot be]{.mark}]{.underline} adequately [explained by
existing deterrence models]{.underline}, which rely on Cold War-era
bipolar game theory \[8\]. [Due to **climate** change]{.underline},
[geopolitical **tension**]{.underline}, and [the Russian invasion of
**Ukraine**]{.underline}, [nuclear relations in the Arctic are
**unstable** and]{.underline} present serious [**security risks** that
cannot be contended with through]{.underline} the use of classic
[deterrence theory]{.underline} \[9\].

ARCTIC GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE

The Arctic region is 66.5° north of the equator and encompasses the
United States, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and
Iceland, all of whom are members of the region's governing body, the
Arctic Council \[10\]. The region's international legal status currently
lies under the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea,
however, [due to **climate change**, polar ice is melting]{.underline},
[making the region **more accessible** by sea and opening up its vast
**oil and gas** deposits for extraction by regional actors]{.underline}
\[11\].

Sino-Russian cooperation along sea routes has given China significant
influence in the region, which it wants to develop into a "Polar Silk
Road" as outlined in its 2018 Arctic White Paper \[12\]. Chinese
development interests do not align with Russia's geopolitical goals in
the Arctic, and China's ownership over Arctic infrastructure represents
an economic threat to Russian interests \[13\]. [There is **growing
competition** between]{.underline} these [regional actors]{.underline}
which is [exacerbated by overlapping territorial **boundary
claims**]{.underline} by Denmark, Canada, and Russia. In addition, [the
**Arctic Council** has suspended cooperation]{.underline} due to its
chairmanship by Russia [until the end of 2023]{.underline} \[14\].

DETERRENCE AND ARCTIC NUCLEAR RELATIONS

[Classic [nuclear **deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline} is steeped in Cold
War bipolarity [and [relies on **two rational actors**]{.mark}
basing]{.underline} their [decisions on what they believe their
opponents\' actions will be]{.underline} \[15\]. Classic deterrence is
expressed through the Chicken Game \[16\]. As seen in the figure below,
a player's options are to defect and pursue a foreign policy objective
or to cooperate and maintain the status quo \[17\]. The best outcome for
an actor is to defect against a cooperating partner; however, this runs
the risk of both players defecting, leading to nuclear annihilation
\[18\].

[This classic **deterrence game** does not contend with the]{.underline}
possibility of conflict between [[multiple]{.mark} nuclear
[actors]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is [[a key feature of
**Arctic**]{.mark} security]{.underline} \[19\]. Though a three-player
chicken game has been applied to theoretical problems, such as two out
of three players needing to complete a task that all would rather not
complete, this model has yet to be applied to nuclear relations \[20\].
China, NATO, the U.S., and Russia's nuclear doctrines are informed by
deterrence theory, which is problematic due to the theory's assumption
of a bipolar world order \[21\].

[Nuclear **[multipolarity]{.mark}** in the Arctic is unstable because it
[no longer falls within]{.mark} the traditional **[game theory]{.mark}
matrix**]{.underline}, and [there is an [increased risk of **nuclear
action** due to]{.mark} a larger [number of]{.mark} nuclear [actors
and]{.mark} significant **regional [tension]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[22\]. [**[Preemptive]{.mark} nuclear [strikes]{.mark}** [are more
prevalent]{.mark}]{.underline} in multipolar nuclear politics [[due
to]{.mark} a greater **[perception]{.mark} of threat** from other
actors]{.underline} \[23\]. Though China promotes itself as a No First
Use (NFU) state, meaning that it will not strike unless struck upon in a
nuclear capacity, [Russia has threatened to strike first]{.underline},
[and [America's]{.mark} position on [**NFU** is
vague]{.mark}]{.underline} \[24\]. NATO is a nuclear deterrent
organisation in the Arctic region, only Sweden is not yet a full NATO
member and Finland has just recently gained NATO membership \[25\]. In
multipolar deterrence, [regional [conflicts]{.mark} are more [likely to
escalate into **total**]{.mark} **nuclear
[warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and de-escalation relies on political
bargaining as opposed to rationality modelling. Thus, it is unclear how
political bargaining will take place in an increasingly polarised Arctic
\[26\].

Though the U.S., China, and Russia have all acceded to or ratified the
Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NNPT), both Russia
and the U.S. have backed out of data-sharing obligations under the New
START treaty \[27\]. [This **breakdown in communication** between Arctic
actors]{.underline} due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Russia's
recent threat to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. [indicates that
[future]{.mark} regional [disputes]{.mark} over Arctic
**resources**]{.underline}, **[navigation]{.underline}**, [and
**territory** may [give rise to nuclear crises]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[28\].

CONCLUSION

[[Climate change]{.mark} in the **Arctic**]{.underline} has rendered the
region more accessible to its actors; this [has [inflamed
tensions]{.mark} between the **NATO** bloc and **Russia**]{.underline}
over territorial disputes and Russia's war in Ukraine and between China
and Russia due to diverging economic development goals \[29\]. As
temperatures warm, [the [region may become a **nuclear
flashpoint**]{.mark} that cannot be analysed using classic deterrent
models]{.underline} \[30\].

**Extinction.**

**Shute '23** \[Joe; September 12; Ph.D. Researcher at Manchester
Metropolitan University; UnHerd, "An Arctic War is Coming,"
https://unherd.com/2023/09/an-arctic-war-is-coming-russia-china/\]

A similar story is being recorded right across the High North. "Arctic
amplification" is the term meteorologists use for the accelerated rate
of global warming. But the same amplification is occurring with the
geopolitics of the region. The Arctic is melting --- one scientific
study, published in June, claimed that the first summer in which all sea
ice disappears could occur as early as the 2030s --- and, from China to
the US to Putin's Russia, suddenly everyone wants a piece. [The **era**
of]{.underline} "[Arctic **exceptionalism**]{.underline}" declared by
Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 [is]{.underline} resolutely
**[over]{.underline}**, his [entreaties for]{.underline} the [Arctic to
remain a "zone of peace]{.underline}" free from conflict and
exploitation [forgotten]{.underline}. As climate change accelerates and
Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} has [**cleaved** apart the
international **order**, the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} has [emerged
as]{.underline} the potential [[theatre of]{.mark} the next **[global
conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Alexander, who also represents the Gwich'in on the Arctic council (which
includes the eight Arctic states, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
Finland, Iceland, the US and Russia) warns that [the global **race** to
plunder]{.underline} the [Arctic]{.underline} could [have
**devastating** consequences]{.underline}. "If you don't co-operate on
the Arctic and we don't get these things right, then I'll tell you this,
my friend: the world can change very rapidly."

**[Russia]{.underline}**, whose [territory **spans** around 53% of the
Arctic]{.underline} Ocean [shoreline]{.underline}, and
**[China]{.underline}** are rapidly [developing plans to expand
the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**orthern **[S]{.underline}**ea
**[R]{.underline}**oute. The maritime passage between the east and west
of the Arctic Ocean is regarded by the Kremlin as vital to avoid Western
sanctions. It is already possible to navigate the route for anyone with
several briefcases full of dollars to pay for the mandatory Russian ice
breakers which accompany any transit as patrol vessels. In 2024, the
Kremlin is planning to commence year-round navigations of the route,
through which it hopes to increase the amount of cargo shipped from
around 30 million annually to 80 million.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which has ominously [[declared
itself]{.mark} a "**near-[Arctic]{.mark}** [state]{.mark}"]{.underline}
--- also harbours ambitions to transform the passage into a silk road of
the far north, while in March, a Russian delegation to India held talks
over new co-operation over the route. [The [**West**
is]{.mark}]{.underline} similarly [flexing its muscles,]{.underline}
with [Finland]{.underline} (and the expected accession of Sweden)
[[extending **NATO's** borders]{.underline}]{.mark} into the Arctic. In
June, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced that the US
would be opening an outpost in the far-north Norwegian town of Tromsø,
stressing the need to have "a diplomatic footprint" above the Arctic
Circle. "[The war in **Ukraine**]{.underline} has really
[torpedoed]{.underline} this idea of [Arctic
exceptionalism]{.underline}," explains Dr Neil Melvin, Director of
International Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).
"The whole focus of northern Europe has basically now shifted to
building security against Russia."

As Melvin points out, [the]{.underline} heavy losses [sustained by
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}'s land army in [Ukraine will **force** it
to become increasingly [**reliant** on]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear force**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} stationed [[in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, where the UK and US have also long
operated their own attack submarines. Russia's Northern Fleet comprises
of a dozen or so nuclear-powered attack submarines as well as surface
vessels, including two heavy nuclear-powered missile battle cruisers. In
recent years, Russia has also reoccupied old Cold War-era Arctic bases
to bolster its presence. "[They will feel more
**vulnerable**]{.underline} as a result of not having a strong army,
[and]{.underline} I think we are likely to see them [**threaten**
nuclear options]{.underline} much more as part of national defence,"
Melvin says of Russia's designs in the Arctic. "[They are going to be
much more **explicit** and threatening]{.underline}."

Beneath the ice, the Arctic possesses untold riches. The region is
estimated to contain a fifth of the world's undiscovered oil and gas
reserves and rare earth elements such as gold, nickel and zinc. While
most of these are present within the largely undisputed land borders of
the Arctic nations, it is the [increasingly navigable international
**waters**]{.underline} that [present the most likely
**flashpoint**]{.underline}. An ongoing process led by a United Nations
commission is considering sovereignty rights to the central Arctic Ocean
between Russia, Denmark and Canada. While Putin is cooperating with the
process so far, he has also planted a flag in the most literal sense ---
dropping a titanium standard of the Russian Federation two miles beneath
the ocean on the North Pole seabed in 2007. Fishing rights are also key;
as southern oceans heat up, species will migrate ever further north,
causing estimated catches in higher latitudes to increase by up to 20
per cent by 2050.

According to Professor Klaus Dodds, an expert in geopolitics and ice
studies based at Royal Holloway and author of the recent book, Border
Wars, the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard could prove another area of
conflict. Under a treaty originally signed in 1920, a host of countries
including China and Russia have rights to engage in commercial
activities across Svalbard. Moscow conducts coal mining operations on
the island of Spitsbergen (and insists on referring to Svalbard by the
same name, to emphasise its historic claim on the land). In settlements
such as Barentsburg, Russian is the predominant language.

"The concern is we know we have [potential **[flashpoints]{.mark}** like
Svalbard]{.underline} which, having caused agitation and tension in the
past, might be [**[escalate]{.mark}**d very
**[quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Dodds says. Aggression could be
anything from [[attacks on]{.mark} underwater
**[cables]{.mark}**]{.underline} (last year, a Russian trawler was
linked to the severing of a sub-sea fibre-optic cable which linked
Svalbard to the Norwegian mainland), [to]{.underline} an outright
[attack on oil and gas **[infra]{.mark}structure**]{.underline}. "The
Norwegian European Arctic will be the space where, if anything, this is
most likely to happen," Dodds says. "That [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[be]{.mark} the ultimate **opportunity** for Russia to test
**NATO**'s resolve]{.underline}."

Regardless of the [potential for **[nuclear]{.mark}
conflict**]{.underline}, a burning Arctic poses grave threats for
humanity. The Arctic permafrost contains peatland soils which are the
world's most vital carbon sink. Globally, peatlands store twice as much
carbon as all the forests combined. When this burns, it releases the
carbon back into the atmosphere creating something of a doom loop.
According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, wildfires
across Canada have released 290 megatons of carbon into the atmosphere
between January and August, more than 25% of the global total for 2023
in the year to date.

Thawing permafrost is also exposing chemical and radioactive waste and
millennia-old "zombie viruses". In 2016, around 100,000 reindeer were
culled in the Russian far north after an anthrax outbreak that killed a
12-year-old boy. Plague bacillus, smallpox and other historic diseases
are also feared to soon re-emerge from the melting earth. The discovery
earlier this summer of 46,000-year-old roundworms lying dormant in
Siberia, which are happily reproducing once again, may hold clues for
adapting to climate change --- but they also raise questions about what
else might venture forth in a thaw. And herein lies [the **great
lesson** of]{.underline} the [far north]{.underline}, Professor Dodds
explains: nothing here ever happens in isolation --- [there will
be]{.underline} wider [[**ramifications** across the
**globe**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Change in the Arctic is never
restricted to the Arctic itself," he says. "It is almost as if the
Arctic strikes back."

The time is long gone where we could think of [the Arctic]{.underline}
as a great pristine wilderness. Instead it has become the burning
crucible of our climate crisis. But, as the towering glaciers melt and
the seas of the Earth's fifth largest ocean are revealed to us at last,
their future looks even darker still, [reanimating]{.underline} the
[**bio**logical threats]{.underline} of our deep past, and
[providing]{.underline} yet another [site for]{.underline} human
competition and **[conquest]{.underline}**.

### Russian aggression in Arctic = conflict

#### Constrained access to arctic arenas is [key]{.underline} to stopping Russian aggression; maintains European energy [independence]{.underline} and avoids territorial [sovereignty]{.underline} in Ukraine. 

**Coffey 20'** -- Luke, director of the Allison Center for Foreign
Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation. "While the U.S. is not a
Black Sea country, it needs to be a Black Sea power", Middle East
Institute,
https://www.mei.edu/publications/while-us-not-black-sea-country-it-needs-be-black-sea-power,
07-21-2020

While the Baltic region is incredibly important for NATO, this lack of
focus on [[the Black Sea]{.underline}]{.mark} was unfortunate. The
region [[matters to the U.S. and]{.mark} its [NATO]{.mark}
allies]{.underline}. [The Black Sea is [home to three NATO
members]{.mark}]{.underline} (Romania, Turkey and Bulgaria) [[and two
aspirant NATO countries that face partial Russian
occupation]{.underline}]{.mark} (Ukraine and Georgia). [[Important oil
and gas transit links]{.mark} crisscross the region. So do many
important fiber optic cables and shipping lanes.]{.underline}

On the tactical level, [[Moscow's]{.underline}]{.mark} action in the
region and its [[militarization]{.underline} [of Crimea furthers its
**goal of making the Black Sea a Russian lake**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Russia has deployed 28,000 troops to Crimea and has embarked on a major
program to build housing, restore airfields, and install new radars
there. In addition, Russia has deployed advanced air defense and
anti-ship missiles that give it a leg up above the rest in terms of
controlling the surface and the skies above the Black Sea.

On the strategic level, [**Russia [uses the Black Sea as a springboard
to challenge U.S. interests]{.mark}** elsewhere in the
world]{.underline}. For example, [Russia has used its Black Sea
presence]{.underline} on occupied Crimea to launch and support naval
operations [in support of]{.underline} Syrian President Bashar
al-[Assad]{.underline}. In the early days of Moscow's intervention in
Syria, the Moskva, a Russian navy guided missile cruiser, played a vital
role in providing air defense for Russian forces. Hundreds of thousands
of tons of grain and wheat have been shipped from Crimea to Syria to
help the Assad Regime's food shortage problems. Hundreds of trips have
been made between Crimea's port city of Sevastopol and the Russian naval
base in Tartus, Syria to transport military hardware and resupplies.

Thankfully policymakers are now waking up. For the U.S. three Black Sea
countries can play an important role in America's presence in the
region: Romania, Georgia and Ukraine.

Romania is the most enthusiastic of all the Black Sea countries inside
NATO about maintaining a strong presence in the region. Romania has
sought closer military, economic, and political relations with the
United States. As Romania's new National Defense Strategy states about
Romanian-U.S. relations: "Romania aims at consolidating its military
cooperation with the United States, not just as a mere course of action
derived from our status as allies, but as an operational objective to be
implemented on the national territory."

When it comes to Black Sea security Romania also has a special role to
play serving as the confluence of the Danube River. This is especially
true as proposals have been made to use access to the Danube River as a
way to increase NATO presence in the Black Sea.

Romania has shown a willingness to step up to the plate when the
geopolitical situation requires. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014,
Bucharest became an outspoken supporter of Ukraine's territorial
integrity. And was one of the first countries in Europe to call for the
arming of the Ukrainian military in the face of Russian aggression.

Even before becoming a member of NATO Romania was willing to support
NATO led operations in the Balkans by giving access to its airspace for
operations. Romania has contributed troops to the NATO mission in
Kosovo. Thousands of Romanian troops have been deployed to Afghanistan
and Iraq to support US and NATO led operations in those countries.
Currently, Romania has more than 730 soldiers serving in Afghanistan.
Also, Mihail Romania's Kogalniceanu Air Base is a major logistics and
supply hub for U.S. equipment and personnel traveling to the Middle East
region.

Across the Black Sea from Romania, [**[Georgia is another important
partner]{.mark}** for the U.S.]{.underline} After the Russian invasion
of Georgia in 2008, and the subsequent occupation of 20 percent of its
territory, [[Georgia]{.mark} has [transformed its military]{.mark} and
has been **[steadfast in its support of NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
well as non-NATO, U.S.-led overseas security operations. [Georgia has
contributed thousands of troops]{.underline} to Iraq and Afghanistan,
[and hundreds of peacekeepers]{.underline} to the Balkans and Africa.
[Even with the Russian invasion]{.underline} and its aftermath, [Georgia
has not been deterred from getting closer to the West]{.underline}. This
has made Georgia a net contributor to transatlantic security and is a
key part of any Black Sea strategy.

Georgia is important to the U.S. and NATO for three main reasons.

First, **[Georgia is a proven and dependable ally]{.underline}** [in
Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}. In 2012, when many NATO countries
were rushing for the door in Afghanistan[, Georgia added hundreds of
troops to the mission]{.underline} there. At the height of the Georgian
contribution to Afghanistan, it had more than 2,000 troops serving in
some of the deadliest places in the country, if not the world, in
Helmand and Kandahar Provinces. Today, Georgia has 870 troops in
Afghanistan, making it the largest non-NATO troop contributor to the
NATO training mission.

Second, located on the Black Sea, [Georgia [sits at a **crucial
geographical**]{.mark} and cultural **[crossroads]{.mark}** and has
proven itself to be **[strategically important for military and economic
reasons for centuries]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Today Georgia offers its
territory, infrastructure, and logistic capabilities for the transit of
NATO forces and cargo]{.underline} for Afghanistan. Over the years,
Georgia has modernized key airports and port facilities in the country.
[This is particularly important [when it comes]{.mark} to the [Black
Sea]{.mark} region]{.underline}. **[[Key
pipelines]{.underline}]{.mark}** like the Baku--Tbilisi--Ceyhan
pipeline, the Baku--Supsa pipeline, and the Southern Gas Corridor
**[transit through Georgia[, as do]{.mark} important [rail
lines]{.mark}]{.underline}** like the recently opened
Baku--Tbilisi--Kars railway. The **[oil and gas pipelines are
particularly i[mportant to Europe's energy security,]{.mark}
and]{.underline}** therefore **[NATO's interest]{.underline}** in the
region.

Finally, [**Georgia's journey to democracy is an example** for the
region.]{.underline} Since regaining independence in 1991 after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia has been on a steady journey to
democracy. Over the years, [successive Georgian governments have pursued
an agenda of]{.underline} liberalizing the economy, cutting bureaucracy,
[fighting corruption, and embracing democracy.]{.underline}

As the target of Russia's most recent act of aggression in the region,
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[plays an important role
regarding]{.mark} stability and [security in the Black
Sea.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[Ukraine is in the midst of a national struggle that will determine its
future geopolitical orientation: the West or Moscow.]{.underline} [The
outcome of this struggle will have long-term implications for the
transatlantic community]{.underline} [and the notion of national
sovereignty.]{.underline} Since 2014, almost 5 percent of Ukraine's
landmass and more than half of its coastline have been under illegal
Russian occupation in Crimea.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO, and so it does not enjoy the Alliance's
security guarantee, but [it was Kyiv's desire to join institutions such
as NATO]{.underline} and the EU [that persuaded Russia to invade in
2014]{.underline}. [**Ukraine represents the idea that countries** in
Europe **should be free to choose how and by whom they are governed**,
and which international organizations and alliances they wish to
join.]{.underline} **[No outside country]{.underline}**, [in this case
Russia, **should have a veto.**]{.underline}

With time [[Ukraine has]{.mark} the [potential to become]{.mark} [one of
the most dominant powers on the Black Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[**The U.S. has been investing and improving Ukraine's maritime
capabilities**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

For different reasons Romania, Georgia and Ukraine play an important
role in the Black Sea. The U.S. can work more closely to enhance its
bilateral relationship and improve Black Sea security.

For Romania, the U.S. should look at ways to increase its presence in
the land and air domains in the country. This could mean U.S. troops and
fighter jets permanently based there. For years most of the U.S. and
NATO focus on the Black Sea has been the maritime domain. While this is
important, the land and air domains cannot be ignored.

[[For both Georgia and Ukraine, **the U.S. must work with NATO**]{.mark}
allies **[to ensure both are kept on the path to eventual membership
into the Alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time the U.S.
should work with both to improve their military capabilities.

[While the U.S. is not a Black Sea country, it needs to be a Black Sea
power]{.underline}. To make this happen Washington must build on its
relations with Romania, Georgia and Ukraine. This will make America,
NATO, and the region safer.

### Russia war = extinction

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, even [in an all-out
**[nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark}** [between the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite horrific casualties, neither
country's population is likely to be completely destroyed by the direct
effects of the blast, fire, and radiation.8 [The aftermath]{.underline}
could be much worse: the burning of flammable materials [could
[send]{.mark} massive amounts of [**smoke** into the
atmosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} would **absorb
sunlight** and [cause]{.mark} sustained **global
[cooling]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [severe **[ozone
loss]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and **ag**]{.underline}]{.mark}ricultural
**[[disruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [a nuclear winter]{.underline}.

According to one model 9 , [an all-out exchange of **4,000
weapons**]{.underline}10 [could lead to a drop in global temperatures of
around **8°C**]{.underline}, [making it **[impossible to grow
food]{.mark}**]{.underline} for 4 to 5 years. This could leave some
[survivors]{.underline} in parts of Australia and New Zealand, but they
[would be in a very **precarious situation** and the threat of
**extinction** from other sources **would be great**]{.underline}. [[An
exchange]{.mark} on this scale [is **only possible** between]{.mark} the
[**US** and **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} who have more than 90% of
the world's nuclear weapons, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads
each, although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models
suggest that even [a small **[regional nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline} involving 100 nuclear weapons would produce a
nuclear winter serious enough to put two billion people at risk of
starvation,12 though this estimate might be pessimistic.13 Wars on this
scale [[are **unlikely** to lead to]{.mark} outright human
**[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but this does suggest that
conflicts which are around an order of magnitude larger may be likely to
threaten civilisation. It should be emphasised that there is very large
uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global climate.
This remains an area where increased academic research work, including
more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of how
survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns.

It is very difficult to precisely estimate the probability of
existential risk from nuclear war over the next century, and existing
attempts leave very large confidence intervals. According to many
experts, the most likely nuclear war at present is between India and
Pakistan.14 However, given the relatively modest size of their arsenals,
[the [risk of]{.mark} human [**extinction** is]{.mark} plausibly
**greater** [from]{.mark} a conflict between the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and **[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Tensions
between these countries have increased in recent years and it seems
unreasonable to rule out the possibility of them rising further in the
future.

**[TIMEFRAME]{.underline}\-\--Russian [high alert]{.underline} ensures
[instantaneous]{.underline} nuclear escalation.**

Rear Admiral Andrei Sinitsyn said: [\'The test **site** is

state-owned Rossiyskaya Gazeta.

\'We are constantly ready to repel all types of threats, including the
penetration of sabotage and reconnaissance groups onto the island,\' he

Mr Sinitsyn said that \'the \'Central Test Site of the Russian

He said the tests were \'in the interests of state security\'.

But pressed on whether the site was ready to \'if necessary, resume

The site has not been used for nuclear testing since October 1990, after
which the ailing USSR ruled out future tests, maintained by Russia.

Images obtained by the Middlebury Institute for International Studies
last year showed an uptick in construction at the remote island
location, RFE reported at the time.

A comparison of imagery from July 2021 and June 2023 showed large
trucks, construction cranes, shipping containers and building supplies
brought in to the settlement for its expansion.

Mr Sinitsyn said the main priorities, and raison d\'être for the site,
were to deter perceived aggressors through the \'readiness\' of testing
ground infrastructure.

He said this included maintaining a \'laboratory\' and \'experimental

## Affirmative Answers

### Thumpers -- US upsetting NATO now

#### Trump has already made NATO irrelevant and they don't believe our commitment

Joshua **Keating** Mar 17, **2025**, 6:00 AM CDT Has Trump already
killed NATO? ﻿Does anyone still believe the US would go to war to defend
Europe?
https://www.vox.com/world-politics/404139/nato-trump-article-5-europe-russia

At this point, [[the better question is whether Trump has effectively
made the alliance irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark}. The US is still a
NATO member. But [[Trump has consistently undermined its core
principle]{.underline}]{.mark} that members will treat any attack on
another member's territory as an attack on their own, and come to the
attacked member's aid. [[This principle of mutual defense only works if
both the allies and their adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} [[believe
that it's credible]{.underline}]{.mark} --- that countries would
actually put the lives of their own citizens on the line to defend
allies. In the case of Trump and NATO, [[the guarantee is getting a lot
harder to believe]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Would Donald Trump choose to go
and fight for Estonia?" said Dalibor Rohac, a senior fellow and expert
on European politics at the American Enterprise Institute. "I think at
some level, it requires a suspension of disbelief to think that he
would." [[Trump's second term has already been]{.underline}]{.mark} far
more [[alarming,]{.underline}]{.mark} from a European perspective than
the first, thanks to actions including Trump's abrupt pivot toward
Russia in the Ukraine war, the Oval Office humiliation of Volodymyr
Zelenskyy, his new tariffs, JD Vance's combative speech at the Munich
Security Conference, the territorial threats toward NATO members Canada
and Denmark, and reports that the president is considering redeploying
troops from Germany to Russia-friendly Hungary. European leaders might
have thought of Trump's first term as an aberration, a bizarre four
years followed by a return to normalcy. His return to the White House
made clear they may be dealing with a very different United States going
forward --- one whose security commitments can't be taken for granted in
the long run, even if Trump is replaced by another Joe Biden-style
transatlanticist in four years. Recent statements from [[European
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} suggest they [[are not so confident about
the credibility of America's commitment to the
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}. "I want to believe that the US will stand
by our side, but we have to be ready for that not to be the case,"
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a recent televised speech to
the nation. "Strategic autonomy" from Washington has long been a
priority for Macron, and something of a French tradition dating back to
the formation of the alliance. It was more surprising to hear Germany's
likely incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz, hailing from a center-right
party with a strong transatlanticist tradition, say that "After Donald
Trump's statements...it is clear that the Americans are largely
indifferent to the fate of Europe" and that Europe must work as quickly
as possible to "achieve independence from the US." Some of this work
will involve steps to increase defense spending, military readiness, and
aid to Ukraine that are already underway. There have also been
increasing conversations on the continent about developing an
independent nuclear deterrent, outside of Washington's control. Either
way, i[[t's clear that the alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} that has been
the bedrock of Western security strategy for nearly 80 years [[is no
longer what it was]{.underline}]{.mark}. Without actually leaving it,
[[Trump may have simply made NATO irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark}.

https://lansinginstitute.org/2025/04/02/the-future-of-nato-under-trump-declining-u-s-influence-european-alternatives-and-the-strategic-consequences/

The U.S. President Donald [[Trump's skepticism toward
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and opposition to Ukraine's membership in the
alliance [[have raised concerns about the long-term viability of
transatlantic security cooperation.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[His stance
weakens U.S. influence in European security matters and compels European
allies to reassess their defense strategies]{.underline}]{.mark},
including the potential creation of an independent military-political
bloc led by France, Germany, the UK, and Italy. [[Trump has consistently
criticized NATO, calling it obsolete and questioning the financial
contributions of member states]{.underline}]{.mark}. His resistance to
Ukraine's NATO membership aligns with his broader skepticism toward U.S.
security commitments in Europe. The key aspects of his stance include:
Opposition to Further NATO Enlargement: Trump views NATO expansion as a
provocation toward Russia and a burden on U.S. defense resources.
Transactional Approach to Alliances: He emphasizes a cost-benefit
analysis, urging European allies to increase their military spending.
Reduced U.S. Leadership in NATO: Trump's reluctance to support Ukraine's
accession weakens American influence in European security matters. After
1945, the U.S. played a central role in shaping the global order: NATO
(1949): Created to deter Soviet aggression and ensure European security
under U.S. leadership. Marshall Plan (1948): Rebuilt war-torn Europe,
preventing the spread of communism. Military Presence: U.S. bases in
Germany, Italy, and elsewhere provided stability and deterred
adversaries. Leadership in Global Institutions: The U.S. helped
establish the UN, IMF, and World Bank to foster stability and economic
growth. 2. How Trump's Policies Undermine This Legacy Weakening NATO's
Credibility: [[Trump's threats to withdraw from NATO and demands for
European countries to "pay more" create doubts about U.S. commitment.
This emboldens adversaries like Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Encouraging
European Strategic Autonomy: His rhetoric forces Europe to consider
alternatives, such as an EU-led defense bloc (France, Germany, Italy,
UK). [[This could reduce U.S. influence over European
security.]{.underline}]{.mark} Questioning the U.S. as a Reliable
Partner: [[Allies are increasingly uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}
whether the U.S. will defend them in a crisis, which weakens American
diplomatic leverage. Risking a Power Vacuum: If the U.S. retreats,
Russia or China could exploit divisions in Europe to expand their
influence, undermining Western cohesion. 3. Long-Term Consequences for
the U.S. Loss of Strategic Influence: If Europe develops its own
military structures, it may act independently from U.S. interests.
Erosion of the Transatlantic Alliance: The U.S. could lose key allies in
shaping global security policy. Greater Instability: A fragmented
Western alliance could make future conflicts (e.g., Russian aggression,
cyber warfare, terrorism) harder to manage. By retreating from European
security commitments, Trump risks dismantling the post-WWII order that
has kept Europe stable and the U.S. dominant. This could be seen as one
of the most significant reversals of American foreign policy in modern
history.

rhetoric on Russia sanctions
https://www.politico.eu/article/marco-rubio-surprise-nato-allies-rhetoric-russia-sanctions-ukraine-invasion-war-defense-donald-trump-us/

U.S. Secretary of State Marco [[Rubio]{.underline}]{.mark} on Wednesday
[[threw cold water on European calls for more sanctions on
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[That came as a surprise to the NATO
foreign ministers]{.underline}]{.mark} Rubio met the night before at the
alliance's annual summit. In that Tuesday night conversation during a
private dinner focused on Ukraine, Rubio teased that the Senate would
likely take up legislation to increase sanctions on Russia after it
finishes work on President Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" tax and
spend measure, which he said could pass as soon as this week, according
to four European diplomatic officials familiar with the meeting. Rubio,
who came under criticism at the dinner over Trump's reluctance to
toughen up on Moscow, acknowledged to his European counterparts that
Russia was the problem holding back peace talks to end the Ukraine war,
according to the officials, who were granted anonymity to discuss the
private dinner. But hours later during an [exclusive interview with
POLITICO's Dasha
Burns](https://www.politico.com/video/2025/06/25/exclusive-marco-rubio-sits-down-with-politico-at-nato-summit-1668156)
on the sidelines of the NATO summit, [[Rubio outlined the
administration's rationale for holding off on further sanctioning
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. "If we did what everybody here wants us to
do, and that is come in and crush them with more sanctions, we probably
lose our ability to talk to them about the ceasefire and then who's
talking to them?" Rubio said, adding that Trump will know the "time and
place" for changing tack. Asked about the discrepancy, a senior U.S.
official said Rubio is stressing the same main points, but his
interlocutors are focusing on different parts. "The secretary has been
very consistent in meeting and calls with his counterparts on three key
points --- one is that the president believes strongly that the only way
this war ends is through negotiations; second, as soon as the U.S.
imposes new sanctions on Russia the opportunity for the U.S. to be
involved in those negotiations closes; and third, that the Senate, in
America anyway, is an independent body that at some point is going to
move on those sanctions,\" the official said.

considering major NATO policy shift", NBC News,
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-considering-major-nato-policy-shift-rcna195089,
03-06-2025

WASHINGTON --- [President Donald Tru[mp is considering a major change to
the U.S.' participation in]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**orth
**[A]{.mark}**tlantic **[T]{.mark}**reaty **O**rganization]{.underline},
according to three current and former senior U.S. officials and one
congressional official.

[[Trump has discussed with aides]{.mark} the [possibility of calibrating
America's NATO engagement]{.mark} in a way that favors members of the
alliance that spend a set percentage of their gross domestic product on
defense]{.underline}, the officials said.

As part of the potential policy shift, [[the U.S. might not defend a
fellow NATO member that is attacked if the country doesn't meet the
defense spending threshold]{.mark}, the officials said. If Trump does
make that change, [it would mark a significant shift from a core tenet
of the alliance]{.mark} known as Article 5, which says that an attack on
any NATO country is an attack on all of them]{.underline}.

The president is similarly considering a policy change in which the U.S.
may choose to prioritize military exercises with NATO members that are
spending the set percentage of their GDPs on defense, the officials
said. [[His administration has already signaled]{.mark} to America's
European allies [that the U.S. could reduce its military presence in
Europe]{.mark}, and one option now under consideration is to reposition
some U.S. troops in the region so they are focused in or around NATO
countries that have scaled their defense spending to meet the specific
percentage of their GDPs, the officials said.]{.underline}

Asked about Trump considering making these changes to how the U.S.
engages with NATO, a National Security Council official said in a
written statement, "President Trump is committed to NATO and Article V."

Sen. Chris Coons, of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate
Appropriations Subcommittee for Defense and a senior senator on the
Foreign Relations panel, said Trump's nominee to be U.S. ambassador to
NATO, Matthew Whitaker, "gave very reassuring answers" on the
administration's commitment to NATO and Article 5.

Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO countries for not meeting the
current NATO member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defense. He has
argued that the disparity is unfair and puts an added burden on the U.S.

NATO countries agreed more than a decade ago to set the spending goal
for each of them at 2% of GDP. But Trump has pushed to increase that
percentage. Most recently he said NATO members should spend 5% of their
GDP on defense, though the U.S. does not currently do that.

"NATO has to pay more," Trump said in January after taking office. "It's
ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in
between."

According to NATO's most recent statistics, last year 23 NATO members'
defense spending exceeded 2% of their GDP. Five of those nations ---
Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland and the U.S. --- spent more than 3% on
defense. Poland had the highest percentage, dedicating 4.12% of its GDP
to defense.

[[The]{.mark} potential [shift]{.mark} in how the U.S. participates in
NATO [comes as Trump is pushing European allies to do more to aid
Ukraine in its war with Russia]{.mark} and to play a major role in
maintaining peace in the country if a deal to end the war is
reached]{.underline}.

"[I was contacted by [several European ambassadors concerned about
rumors that Trump might make some negative announcement about
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}," Coons told NBC News in an interview on
Wednesday. Trump didn't announce anything at his joint address to
Congress on Tuesday night, but Coons said, "[[If you're not given pause
by everything about President Trump's statements and actions on foreign
policy, you're not paying **attention**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

on Thursday [[that he saw a \"positive dynamic\" in relations between
Moscow and Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}, though more meetings were

U.S. media outlets after talks with officials from President Donald
Trump\'s administration, also said [[he saw prospects for the beginning
of a solution to]{.underline}]{.mark} the more than three-year-old war
in [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. He said [[his talks in Washington had

direct air links. Dmitriev\'s visit to Washington follows U.S.-Russian
talks in Saudi Arabia and agreement on U.S.-brokered ceasefires against

\"[[Without doubt, we note a positive dynamic in our

### NATO resilient

**NATO is resilient -- it has thrived for 75 years and won't crumble
under the plan**

**Atlantic Council, 2024** The NATO perspective: Strengthening
resilience within the Alliance
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/event/the-nato-perspective-strengthening-resilience-within-the-alliance/

Earlier this year, [[NATO---the most resilient and successful military
alliance in history---celebrated its seventy-fifth
anniversary.]{.underline}]{.mark} Even after seventy-five years,
[[NATO's work continues to be of the utmost importance to the peace and
security of the transatlantic community and a cornerstone of resilience
for Europe.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The notion of national resilience and
the capacity to withstand a major shock is a fundamental national and
collective responsibility of all NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
outlined in NATO's Article 3. With geopolitical tensions on the rise,
exposed and inflamed by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, this
event will aim to examine the main challenges being posed to national
and collective resilience across the alliance. The discussion will touch
upon what can be learned from allies on the Eastern flank and consider
how NATO can transform concepts into actionable measures. It will
emphasize the dynamic relationship between NATO, individual governments,
and civil society in fostering a resilient community.

Before Trump heads back to Europe, remember that NATO isn't the G-7 and
military relations are much stronger than the political ones they often
endure. Squee! What is Trump going to say this time? That's how some of
the political press in DC sound already, both giddy and worried about
what President Donald Trump is going to say at the NATO Summit in two
weeks. More seriously, many Americans and Europeans are worried about
what Trump is going to say and do in Brussels, and how much further
Trump may sink U.S. relations in general with European and North
American allies. You can't blame them. The G-7 meeting in Canada last
month was a diplomatic disaster that left foreign policy pundit circles
aghast yet again at how the American president treated the leaders of
his nation's closest allies. (Trump supporters loved every minute of
it.) Even before that meeting, Foreign Policy had run an article
headlined "Can the U.S.-Europe Alliance Survive Trump?" (They were
talking about Trump pulling the U.S. out of the Iran deal.) After
Vancouver, other headlines proclaimed U.S.-European relations at an
all-time low. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe could no
longer "completely rely" on American protection, leading many to
question the future of the alliance. There's only one problem, or
perhaps ray of hope. Relations between G-7 leaders are not the same as
relations between their countries. And the G-7 is not NATO. [[NATO is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} political Twitter or [[a TV roundtable. It's
not an economic club. NATO is a military alliance of treaty-bound
governments with troops trained to kill, fight, and die to protect one
another from foreign attack]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[NATO is a
70-year-old alliance that has withstood political winds and Cold War
nuclear showdowns]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is a pact between democratic
nations that their military men and women will stand that post. [[It
outlasted Kennedy and Kruschev, Brezhnev and Reagan. It will outlast
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} and Putin and Merkel. [[Military relations
are not like political ones]{.underline}]{.mark}. Take Turkey. Defense
One ran the headline "Are U.S.-Turkey Relations Fraying?" five years
ago. They are. Last week, they were "coming to a boil." But what is
happening underneath? Military leaders in constant contact, still
upholding their NATO pledge. Earlier this year, I was talking with one
senior military official who said he understood every American concern
about President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's confounding moves in Syria and
toward Russia, but he put it like this: military-to-military relations
do and must operate on a level plane at one level (as he steadily slid
his hand flat in the air, back and forth), while political relations and
the sometimes-heated rhetoric of elected officials who come and go occur
above them (he raised his hand above his eyes, making the same gesture).
It's true in many places. If military relations sour between the U.S.
and China, it is potentially far more disastrous than any downturn in
the economic, political, or trade spheres. But even when those relations
are not so great, they're often steady. In the early Obama years, when
China froze communications with the U.S. military, Pentagon leaders
begged the PLA to open up and talk, saying repeatedly that the U.S.
wanted both sides to "avoid miscalculations" that could escalate into
war. China opened up, but they also proceeded with a rapid military
technological advance and created new islands to expand their power.
Military relations adjusted, but they continue. At press time, Defense
Secretary Jim Mattis is in Beijing discussing mutual issues like North
Korean denuclearization. Or take Israel. Conservatives, liberals, and
pro-Israeli and political pundits claimed U.S.-Israeli relations were at
an all-time low when Obama and Netanyahu weren't seeing eye-to-eye. But
at the same moment, military and intelligence leaders of both sides were
saying times were never better at their level; as mutual trust,
intelligence coordination, and arms sales were flourishing. The
relationships of national leaders do not always reflect the
relationships of their peoples or militaries. So when you hear
predictions that in two weeks Trump may pull the U.S. out of NATO, take
a breath and think through what it would really take for that to happen.
Think about the military. When Syria's Bashar al-Assad was routing
rebels and some U.S. leaders wanted Obama to intervene with bombs and
troops, there was one group left out of the conversation who also had a
vote: the military. At the time, Defense One ran the headline "Want
Syria? Convince General Dempsey." The point was that as right-left
politics shouted at each other over what to do, Obama's senior military
advisor was sitting atop an officer corps that was extremely wary of
leading the U.S. into another unsure military intervention in the Middle
East just two years after pulling out of Iraq. Now think about the
magnitude of a U.S. withdrawal from NATO. Trump so far has deferred to
the generals repeatedly --- on Syria, on Afghanistan, on Guantanamo, on
North Korea, and, yes, on NATO. Do you really think Joint Chiefs
Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford's "best military advice" to the commander
in chief at this moment in history would be to pull out of NATO? Would
any U.S. military leader's? Would John Kelly's? Would Congress's? Of
course not. We've been through this before. Trump has been dangling NATO
withdrawal (or cheap disparagement) before his
isolationist-but-militaristic base since early in his presidential
campaign. And Trump may continue to dangle it over Europeans, the way he
dangles tweets and falsehoods to manipulate his constituency, the media,
and his opponents. We know that game now. Some of the NATO leaders he is
going to meet in July know it more than most. They were the ones he
humiliated at the G-7. The G-7 isn't NATO. [[NATO will
survive]{.mark}]{.underline} July. But politics is politics, and now we
have a new concern. John Bolton, Trump's still-new national security
advisor, flew to Moscow and received Russian President Vladimir Putin's
assent to a meeting of the two leaders. That's expected sometime in
July, in Europe, around the time that Trump will be across the pond for
the NATO Summit, the president said. "It would look like we will
probably be meeting in the not too distant future and I've said it from
day one getting along with Russia and China and with everybody is a very
good thing," Trump said Wednesday. Forget Bolton. The Trump-Putin
meeting has foreign-policy pundits worried as much as when the president
met North Korea's Kim Jong-Un. Nobody knows what to expect from Trump.
But there's plenty of reason for concern. Already, the Trump-Putin
meeting is left-right meat for partisans and political gamers. If you
hate Trump, you hate the idea of Trump stepping over NATO and falling
into Putin's trap, and you think the outcome will be Trump getting
played yet again by the master former-KGB autocrat whom nobody has yet
to best. After all, if Trump halted military exercises for Kim, what
will he give away to Putin? Crimea? Exercises? Nuclear stockpiles?
Missile defenses? NATO? If you like Trump, you welcome the chance for
the master dealmaker, the outsider, to toss out the diplomatic rulebook
as in Singapore, give Putin an extra-tight manly handshake and get him
on the hook to avoid a new Cold War, put an end to all this nonsense of
so-called Russian interference. Either way, you're not talking about
NATO anymore. You're talking about Trump. It's a pickle. The data shows
the United States has done nothing to back down from defending Europe.
Trump's insistence that NATO's European members spend more on their own
militaries is not a withdrawal, it is an overdue and purposefully
undiplomatic attempt to level an imbalance. Merkel's statement that
Europe cannot "completely rely" on American and British support anymore
is a reflection of what Trump and many American leaders have been saying
for years. Europe shouldn't. But while the new era sorts itself out at
the political level, there's been no backing away from NATO between
militaries. We have seen more, not less, of U.S. and NATO-allied
military exercises, troop deployments and rotations, forward-located
firepower, and political attention to Europe's eastern flank. Military
relations go on. "In the last few weeks \[there has\] been a lot of talk
about, 'Well is the North Atlantic bond still a bond? Is it still an
alliance?' Yes, the answer is yes. We are," said U.S. Ambassador to NATO
Kay Bailey Hutchinson this month in Washington. "America is committed to
NATO, to Article 5, I promise you we really are, and the president has
said it publicly many times," she continued. "[[I think our allies and
our partners know that]{.underline}]{.mark}, but we can never say it too
many times." There's no telling what Trump will say in the coming weeks
around the NATO Summit. It will be a another leadership test for Merkel,
UK's Theresa May, France's Emmanuel Macron, and Canada's Justin Trudeau.
No matter what they say, the press will eat it up. Except none of it
matters much to NATO. [[The alliance will hold]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### NATO has survived significant crisis -- it will remain intact.

Five Factors That Could Fracture NATO;\"
https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/English-Edition-Archives/January-February-2018/An-Alliance-Divided-Five-Factors-That-Could-Fracture-NATO/

The purpose of this project was to identify the possible future risks to
cohesion and to provide NATO with a perspective on how to prevent the
Alliance's cohesion from eroding. Although an absence of external
threats to the Alliance is very unlikely, the future risks to cohesion
may lie in a lack of common understanding of external threats and in
disagreements about priorities among NATO nations. Even though there was
no consensus on the degree to which [[common values play a role in
cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark}, sufficiently aligned interests of NATO
nations, together with a shared purpose, constitute a definite
precondition for a cohesive Alliance. Overall, [[NATO as a whole is more
than just a sum of its parts]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Despite many
challenges and criticisms levied against it over its history, today the
nations that comprise it see its value]{.underline}]{.mark} as an
insurance policy for the unexpected, unforeseeable, and unknowable.
Simply put, in the future, [[cohesion will be the glue that will hold
the Alliance together]{.underline}]{.mark} and give it its strength. If
the future leaders of NATO understand the nature of cohesion, the
factors that contribute to it, and how to maintain it, [[the Alliance
can remain intact]{.underline}]{.mark} to contribute positively to
stability and security in an increasingly unstable and Hobbesian world.

[[NATO has demonstrated impressive resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} and
solidarity [since the Cold War's end]{.underline}. Indeed, it has defied
history; alliances usually disband when the collective threat that
brought them into being disappears. Instead, [[NATO has]{.mark} not only
[survived]{.mark}]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} markedly [[expanded
its membership]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and undertaken]{.mark} major
[missions]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Libya.
As the Cold War came to a close, few observers could have predicted that
NATO, twenty years later, would be in the midst of an extended operation
in Afghanistan while simultaneously carrying out a successful air
campaign to topple the Libyan government. [[The
durability]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of NATO stems from the reality that
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Europe remain one another's best partner]{.underline}]{.mark}. To be

[[regularly test]{.underline}]{.mark} transatlantic
[[solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[But teamwork]{.underline}]{.mark}

NATO Summit in Lisbon, "our relationship with our European allies and

### NATO Fails

#### NATO is outdated and a miserable failure

Jan **Oberg** July 11 **2024**
https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202407/1315875.shtml

In contrast, [[NATO\'s principles and policies have already proven
outdated]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[counterproductive and
violence-increasing.]{.underline}]{.mark} When you look at NATO
countries\' warfare around the world, worldwide base systems and the
clouds of war hanging over Europe due to the NATO-Russia conflict that
led to war in Ukraine, [[it is obvious that NATO has failed
miserably]{.underline}]{.mark} in its promise to taxpayers and the wider
world to create peace. Neither intellectually nor morally can that
failure be explained by projecting all the reasons onto Russia or
anybody else. NATO is responsible for its policies, philosophy, and
actions. First, [[deterrence is like saying to the other side, \"Let\'s
talk\" while holding a pistol against her or his
head]{.underline}]{.mark}. The head does not feel that safe with such a
gesture. Talks without pistols are constructive. But if, for the sake of
the argument, we accept that deterrence has some value, it must be
defensive and not offensive. One example of that is China\'s Great Wall.
It does not threaten anyone but deters invaders. If we combine that
thinking with contemporary technology, we could \"transarm\" to a new
way of combining defensive military defence (shorter range and smaller
destructive capacity) with lots of civilian tools such as early warning,
mediation, peacekeeping, problem-solving and conflict resolution,
reconciliation, and so on. For that, the world needs peace academies,
not only war academies. Disarmament has never led to radical reduction
because when people are told that offensive weapons offer security, they
will be against reducing that security. Give them another, stronger
defence, and they will likely be happy to switch to that.
Defencelessness is not a solution; the world needs more self-defence and
less offensive capacity to secure peaceful coexistence. [[NATO\'s second
principle, US forward defence as close to Russia\'s border as possible,
is destabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark}. NATO countries would never accept
if Russia, China or others put their systems that close to them.
Instead, we need buffer zones and non-alignment to avoid the fear that
fuels arms races. [[The third NATO principle is also
indefensible]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since July 7, 2017, the world has had
the UN-binding Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), and
no opinion poll has ever proven that humanity wants nuclearism. Since
1964, China has had a better nuclear No-First Use policy - which is the
opposite of NATO\'s policy to apply the First-Use principle even against
a conventional attack. However, the multipolar global future at peace
still requires an orderly final abolition of weapons of mass destruction
perhaps by tiny, reciprocated unilateral steps rather than negotiations.
Fourth, NATO\'s expansion, out-of-area operations, and inclusion of
\"partners\" instead of \"members\" in an attempt to go global represent
a gross violation of its treaty, which is a copy of the UN Charter with
Article 5 added, which states that if one member is attacked from the
outside, the others shall come to its rescue. Thus, NATO has nothing to
do with non-members like Kosovo, Yugoslavia, Libya, Ukraine, and so on.
It would have been natural to have closed down NATO when its only raison
d\'etre - the existence of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact
(established six years after NATO) which dissolved in 1989-90. Under US
leadership, NATO\'s Himalayan mistake was to exploit Russia\'s momentary
weakness and make expansion its only raison d\'etre. It violated the
well-documented promises to Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand
\"one inch.\" Instead, it should - and could - have converted itself to
a true peace organization. The world must free resources and cannot
continue to waste 400 times more on militarism than on the UN. The
military is always a net burden on civilian economies. NATO may
celebrate militarism, expansion, and unlawfulness and ignore the risks
of self-destruction. [[The 85 percent majority world does not see peace
and peaceful coexistence flowing out of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} but
looks for new ways of creating true peace.

#### NATO fails at deterrence and antagonizes Russia and China.

of U.S. Policy Toward Russia: Can the Vicious Circle Be Broken?"

NATO EXPANSION---TOWARD OR AGAINST RUSSIA?

[[Another]{.underline}]{.mark} constant [[feature]{.mark} [of U.S.
policy toward Russia has been]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the primacy of
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} as the cornerstone of the post--Cold War
European security architecture, including its expansion to some of the
former Soviet states. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO enlargement
has been the principal instrument of U.S. security policy in Europe and
Eurasia. It reflects a U.S. commitment to a whole, free, democratic, and
peaceful Europe, as well as a view that the alliance should serve as the
vehicle of the continent's post--Cold War transformation. What went
largely unnoticed were Moscow's warnings beginning in 1994 that [[a
"whole Europe" was not compatible with]{.underline}]{.mark} an expanding
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, which would never be open to Russia.
Although [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}'s expansion has not necessarily
been directed against Russia, it [[has negatively affected the Kremlin's
assessment of U.S. motivations and intentions and has been met with
strong objections from Russians across the political
spectrum.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} enlargement
also has [[shaped Russia's perceptions of its own security
requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}, which have had a profound impact on
East-West relations. The issue is whether the U.S. transatlantic
commitment necessitates the alliance's continued eastward expansion and
Open Door policy.31 The Clinton administration launched NATO expansion
in 1997 when it led the alliance to offer memberships to Poland, the
Czech Republic, and Hungary---a policy that the George W. Bush and Obama
administrations subsequently embraced. In addition to extending a
security umbrella to former Soviet bloc countries, NATO membership
encouraged their domestic postcommunist transition to democracy. NATO
was and remains an alliance based on shared democratic values. And
since, as Clinton declared in his 1994 State of the Union address,
"democracies do not attack each other," the democratic transitions of
new NATO members would strengthen European security. In this way, NATO
also became an instrument of democracy promotion.32 Russia has opposed
NATO enlargement almost from the time it was raised as a possibility in
the early 1990s.33 The Kremlin has maintained that NATO's push to the
east threatened Russian security and the alliance's central role in
Europe's security architecture marginalized Russia as a nonmember.
However, Russia's objections proved insufficient to halt the alliance's
expansion; most officials and observers in the West treated such
opinions as remnants of the old Soviet ideology that Russia would shed
as it transitioned to a free market, liberal democracy. For those who
did not believe that Russia would make this transition, NATO expansion
made all the more sense as a hedge against Russia reemerging as a threat
to Europe---a prospect that loomed ever larger as Russia recovered a
good measure of its economic health, authoritarian-leaning domestic
politics, and geopolitical ambitions.34 In 2007, Putin personally
delivered an ominous warning to NATO not to expand further east, though
most in the West regarded such rhetoric as an outdated blast from the
Cold War era.35 Even though the alliance's dual purpose---as a defense
organization and instrument of democracy promotion---had emerged as a
major irritant in the United States' relations with Russia, Putin's
warning effectively was dismissed.36 In 2008, NATO promised membership
to Ukraine and Georgia, crossing the red line that Putin had drawn
around the territory of the former Soviet states.37 In the eyes of U.S.
policymakers, NATO was in effect the only legitimate and viable security
manager for Europe and Eurasia, and its expansion was the only sensible
policy for the entire region.38 Putin's response was the 2008 war with
Georgia, which reaffirmed the red line around the former Soviet space,
stopped NATO's eastward expansion, and marked a major turning point in
European security and in the relationship between NATO and Russia.39 In
2014, the annexation of Crimea and Russia's undeclared war against
Ukraine symbolized the end of the post--Cold War era and the reemergence
of a new East-West divide in Europe. Could this outcome have been
avoided? NATO expansion undoubtedly benefited many countries of Central
and Eastern Europe, providing a much-needed security framework for the
region when it was left without one in the aftermath of the Cold War. It
also played an important role in consolidating these former Soviet bloc
countries' transition from communism. But one size does not fit all.
Political culture, history, geography, culture, and economic ties are
crucially important in shaping individual countries' trajectories. The
ties between Georgia, Ukraine, and Russia---and Moscow's strenuous
objections to NATO membership for these former Soviet
republics---mattered little to the George W. Bush administration or to
the president, who reportedly lobbied for both countries to be admitted
to NATO over many NATO allies' major reservations.40 The promise of
membership to Ukraine and Georgia---without a date or plan for their
accession---was made as a compromise between Bush and many other NATO
leaders, most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who were opposed
to the idea. The promise was vague and lacked concrete details. However,
it was significant as a symbol of U.S. and NATO commitments to the
policy of NATO's eastward expansion regardless of any red lines drawn by
Putin. When Putin spoke about the breakup of the Soviet Union as the
greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century, his message
resonated with its intended domestic audience, reflecting widely held
opinions among average Russians---a fact overlooked by Western
policymakers.41 In retrospect, these warning signs were harbingers of
future strife. But in the prevailing atmosphere of the West's post--Cold
War triumphalism, they were repeatedly dismissed as Russia's atavistic
attachment to an outdated, obsolete past rather than a vision of its
future.42 With the 2008 promise of membership to Georgia and Ukraine,
[[the United States led NATO across an invisible but distinct
line]{.underline}]{.mark}. None of the other Soviet bloc countries that
joined NATO after the Cold War had ties to Russia comparable to those of
Ukraine and Georgia. The countries of Central Europe had been part of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Poland reemerged as an independent state
after World War I and had an adversarial relationship with the Soviet
Union until it was crushed by Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler. The Baltic
states had long been part of the Russian Empire, but they had closer
ties to the German than to the Russian world. Following two decades of
independence, they were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in
1939, and they viewed Russia as an occupying power---a sentiment that
survived Soviet occupation and propelled them to freedom in the late
1980s, helping to unravel the Soviet Union. Ukraine and Georgia share a
different history with Russia. Until 1991, Ukraine had been part of
imperial and later Soviet Russia for more than three hundred years. It
was the empire's industrial heartland, home to its defense industry and
breadbasket, and a bridge to the outside world. Georgia became a Russian
protectorate in 1783 and part of the Russian Empire in 1801. Unlike the
Baltic countries, both were integral parts of the Russian Empire and the
Soviet Union, and although both countries gave rise to powerful
independence movements and played critical roles in the dissolution of
the USSR, many of those ties survive to the present day, even after
Russia went to war against both countries to keep them in its orbit.43
NATO's 2008 pledge of eventual membership to Georgia and Ukraine was a
powerful restatement of its Open Door policy. For both countries---and
perhaps for other Soviet states harboring similar hopes---it was taken
as a Western promise to help them escape Russia's orbit. But [[for
Russia, it was seen as another perilous sign of NATO's boundless
ambitions,]{.underline}]{.mark} and it raised the prospect that it would
lose control, or at least immediate influence, over two neighbors that
it saw as critical to its security, well-being, and prestige as a major
power.44 Given the alliance's commitment to spreading democracy, Russia
also perceived its neighbors' intended accession as a threat to its
domestic stability. Thus, [[the U.S. rejection of Russia's geopolitical
concerns as "atavistic" overlooked Russian
sensitivities]{.underline}]{.mark}.45 Russia's response to it was an
outright repudiation of several key assumptions underpinning the
original arguments for expansion---that Russia would gradually change
its views, come to share the alliance's founding values, and eventually
accept NATO's eastward push as it was intended by its proponents; in
other words, Moscow would see expansion as a move toward Russia, rather
than against it. Russia's opposition to NATO's eastward push lived up to
the expectations of those who argued for the expansion as a hedge
against a resurgent, irredentist Russia. However, the architects of
expansion had not thought through the consequences of that scenario.
Having made the promise of membership to Georgia and Ukraine and
encouraged their aspirations to join NATO, the alliance had not planned
for and did not come to their defense when the two became victims of
Russian aggression. The alliance had made a political but not legal
commitment to their security. In effect, NATO chose to hide behind this
narrow legalistic interpretation of its obligations to member states,
rather than act upon the expansive political commitments that permeated
the official declarations and speeches of its leaders.46 In choosing
inaction, NATO reaffirmed what had long been obvious to many
observers---that it was not committed to the two countries' security.
Russia's wars against Georgia and Ukraine demonstrated the importance of
interests as drivers of Russian, U.S., and NATO actions: Russia had more
at stake in both Georgia and Ukraine than the United States and NATO and
was prepared to go to war to protect those equities. The United States
and its NATO allies did not see their stake in Ukraine and Georgia, or
their commitment to shared values, as important enough to warrant war
with Russia. Moreover, in promising membership to Georgia and Ukraine to
join NATO in the first place, the leaders of the alliance seemed to
overlook the importance of geography. Even the most ardent advocates of
NATO expansion recognize now that geographic proximity to Russia has
been a powerful obstacle to realizing their aspirations of NATO
membership and the alliance's eastward push. Russia's proximity to both
countries has endowed it with a formidable military advantage, and the
alliance would face a daunting challenge in overcoming that advantage if
it chose to come to either country's defense in a conflict with Russia.
That challenge has been made abundantly clear by the ongoing discussion
among defense experts about how the alliance would be able to defend the
Baltic states in a hypothetical future conflict with Russia, given the
latter's overwhelming geographic advantages in such a conflict.47
Finally, [[the costs and benefits to the alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}
of NATO enlargement, as well as the overall geopolitical context, [[have
changed]{.underline}]{.mark} since the early 1990s in two fundamental
ways. First, [[the promise of a Europe whole, free]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and at peace with itself]{.underline}]{.mark} and its neighbors, which
seemed within reach in the aftermath of the Cold War and the dissolution
of the Soviet Union, [[has been replaced with]{.mark}]{.underline} a new
[[division]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe between Russia and NATO.
Several countries that belong to neither camp are now stuck in a
geopolitical no man's land, unwilling to return to Russia's sphere of
influence but unable to reach out to an alliance whose promises of
protection are vague at best. Second, at the time of NATO's first wave
of enlargement in the 1990s, the prospect of a NATO-Russia military
confrontation seemed to have been relegated to Europe's past, and NATO
was preparing to go "out of area."48 Today[[, NATO officials and
military planners are deeply preoccupied with augmenting capabilities to
defend alliance territory against Russian
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a consequence, the costs of opening
NATO's door to Europe's east have risen dramatically with respect to new
members and aspiring applicants. With the alliance focused on dealing
with the new division of Europe and the adversarial relationship with
Russia, the prospect of membership for Georgia and Ukraine has been
pushed into a distant, indefinite future.

Cynically self-serving attempts by Turkey's troublemaker president,
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to sabotage Finland and Sweden's membership
applications also undermine a united front.

Jens [[Stoltenberg]{.underline}]{.mark}, Nato's inoffensive secretary
general, [[will struggle to repair these fissures]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Poland and other "frontline" states want a tougher approach, including
permanent positioning of additional troops, heavy weapons and planes on
Russia's borders. In response, Nato officials promise "robust and
historic" decisions.

As for Ukraine, its leadership has all but abandoned hopes of
membership, solemnly promised at Nato's 2008 Bucharest summit, and has
ceased calling for direct military intervention. "Of course, we will
hear words of support... we are very grateful for that," said its
foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Having previously accused Nato of
"doing nothing", he does not expect concrete action in Madrid on
accession or, for example, "Black Sea security".

That last remark referred to the unforgivable, ongoing US-European
failure to challenge Moscow's illegal blockade of Ukraine's ports, which
is creating global food shortages.

Nato could and should be exerting greater pressure on Russian forces, so
helping persuade Putin to end his genocidal war

It's one of many areas where Nato could and should be exerting greater
pressure on Russian forces, so helping persuade Putin to end his
genocidal war.

Why is Nato not doing more? Taken together, all the rationales and
excuses for passivity and inaction produce a picture of an alliance
significantly less united, powerful and organised than its admirers
pretend.

Initially backing Ukraine, albeit at arm's length, gave Nato a boost.
Its stock rose from the low-point of last year's Afghan withdrawal
debacle.

But if, as expected, the war grinds on, if both sides grow desperate, if
the diplomatic impasse deepens, and if the threat of wider conflict
rises, [Nato's long unaddressed weaknesses and vulnerabilities will
become both more [obvious]{.mark} and more hazardous for those crouching
behind its battlements]{.underline}. Its post-Soviet bluff may finally
be called.

It would be unrealistic to expect seamless political unanimity in so
large an organisation. But the fact that each member has an equal say
when, in terms of military capacity, they are absurdly unequal, hinders
swift, bold decision-making. A Russian nuclear or chemical provocation,
for example, would be likely to produce a paralysing cacophony of
conflicting voices within Nato -- and Putin surely knows it.

At the same time, [[there is huge over-reliance on the
US]{.underline},]{.mark} a military superpower without whose agreement
nothing happens and behind whose might the laggards lurk, refusing to
pay their way.

Organisationally and militarily, too[, Nato is all over the
place.]{.underline} It has three joint command headquarters -- in Italy,
the Netherlands and the US. But its top general is based in Belgium.
[[Inter-operability of]{.mark} different countries' [weapons systems is

### No US-Russia war

#### No [Russian]{.underline} nuclear use. 

**[Shinkman 23']{.underline}** -- Paul, Senior Writer of National
Security at U.S. News. "Putin's Hollow Nuclear Threat", U.S. News,
https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2023-02-24/why-ukraine-wont-lead-putin-to-nuclear-war,
02-24-2023

"[The [likelihood of Russia]{.mark} choosing]{.underline} -- or Putin
choosing -- [[to use **nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** directly
against the West [is **astronomically low**]{.mark}. **It [should not
even be seriously considered]{.mark} at this stage**," says Katherine
Lawlor, senior intelligence analyst at the independent Institute for the
Study of War]{.underline}, which has fastidiously tracked Russia's
military movements since it first invaded Ukraine. "[[Putin would
love]{.mark} it [if]{.mark} Western [leaders **believed**]{.mark} that
[he might]{.mark}. He is many things, [but **he is not
suicidal**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She adds that Putin
ultimately does not want war with NATO -- particularly given the current
state of the Russian army. "[He couldn't even win a conventional war in
Ukraine]{.underline}." [[Putin's **references** to potential nuclear
war]{.mark} serve as an extension of capitalizing on Russia's limited
economic and military resources to bend others' will. It's [a
**tactic**]{.mark} the Russian leader has **accelerated**]{.underline}
since first invading Ukraine in 2014, shortly before Obama dismissed the
former core of the Soviet Union as nothing more than a "regional power."
The method has worked to some degree, most visibly by isolating Germany
from its traditional ironclad allies in the West due to Berlin's
protracted reluctance to send new forms of military aid to Ukraine's
military. And it has effectively raised concern among experts who
specialize in the potential for nuclear war. "It would be dangerous to
assume that Putin would never use nuclear weapons," says Jon Wolfsthal,
a senior adviser to nuclear disarmament advocacy group Global Zero and a
member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which annually
publishes its "Doomsday Clock" marking the potential threat of nuclear
war. He notes that approach "has not been adopted by the United States
Government, by NATO nor by the Bulletin." "Blind faith in deterrence
does not guarantee stability, nor does it take heed of the lessons of
history -- recent and more distant -- that deterrence is fragile and can
fail," he says. "As financial and military pressures on Putin grow, the
concern is that he will not think clearly or may put more emphasis on
survival and the destruction of Ukraine than he does on alliances or
friends." The Bulletin advanced the Doomsday Clock to 90 seconds to
midnight in late January -- closer to "midnight," or theoretical
annihilation, than ever before -- citing not only the threat of nuclear
war from Russia with regard to Ukraine but also the spread of disease
and climate volatility that its invasion has exacerbated. Wolfsthal adds
that the primary tools Western leaders have used to deter Russia --
chiefly economic isolation -- have not yet materialized to a level Putin
takes seriously. "He has invaded a sovereign country, committed war
crimes and is engaged in random bombing of civilians, and yet trade with
a number of countries in Europe and elsewhere has increased," he says.
"If there is a major effort to use economic threats to deter Putin's
possible use of nuclear weapons, we have not seen it, and it has not
been visibly communicated to Russia as far as our research indicates."
Others believe that [Putin's most ferocious [nuclear
rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline} mostly [[exposes the extent to which
the]{.mark} embattled Russian [leader feels **desperate** for]{.mark}
**new sources of [leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They suggest that
leverage is what he was seeking this week with a sudden announcement
that he would suspend Russia's involvement in the New START treaty, the
last nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia. "What
[this is]{.underline}, is [a message]{.underline}," says John Erath, a
former top National Security Council official for European affairs, now
senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation. "For the last six months and more, [Russia\'s
strategy has been to seek leverage on the West to end its support to
Ukraine]{.underline} and suspend the hostilities on terms favorable to
Russia." "This is another ingredient in that stew," he adds. "And like
much Russian food, it is lacking in nutritional value." Erath suggests
that Putin thinks he can trade on the promise of resuming Russia's
obligations to the treaty to convince the U.S. to cease its support for
Ukraine's goals in the war and to acknowledge the Russian army's gains.
"In that sense, [the announcement is a big deal
symbolically]{.underline}," Erath says, adding that Secretary of State
Antony Blinken was right to call the statement "unfortunate and
irresponsible." [Since Putin's decision to invade Ukraine,
[Russia's]{.mark} other [sources of influence are]{.mark} **rapidly
[dwindling]{.mark}**]{.underline} or, more surprisingly, are now exposed
as ineffectual. European countries that previously relied heavily on
flows of Russian energy -- particularly natural gas -- have defied
expectations and survived winter so far without supplies from Moscow.
The endemic rot of corruption within its Ministry of Defense has become
widely exposed. Its conventional military has suffered a string of
embarrassing defeats on the battlefield, including during the beginning
of an ongoing offensive that Russia believed would shift momentum in its
favor. The Institute for the Study of War, like several other private
intelligence firms, believes Putin's nuclear saber-rattling serves more
as an information operation designed to prevent the U.S. and Ukraine's
partners in Europe from providing additional military aid that could be
considered escalatory, such as long-range rockets or sophisticated
tanks. He has had some success, chiefly in Germany's initial hesitancy
to provide Leopard tanks. A year into the war, some things appear to
remain off the table: The U.S. is firmly and vocally opposed to a no-fly
zone, which Ukraine has sought since Day One of the invasion to limit
Russia's ability to attack its defenses and its civilian centers from
the skies. And while American officials publicly say the course of the
war is up to the Ukrainians, they have reportedly bristled at the
suggestion that Kyiv would seek to reclaim the Crimean Peninsula, seized
by Russia in 2014. Similarly, the U.S. has balked at the possibility of
providing weapons that could carry the war into Russia itself. What
Putin also has in his favor is a dramatic reversal in the outlook of
some key figures in the Republican Party, who have inexplicably changed
their perspective on Russia under the leadership of Trump in recent
years. With Moscow once the center of Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" and
more recently viewed as an autocratic state seeking to reestablish an
empire by force at the cost of newly democratic nations, the party of
Trump finds itself with an estimated 97% percent of the Russian army
engaged in a ground war and being routed by a foreign army without the
loss of a single American life -- yet questioning the financial cost of
the commitment. What that means in the course of a presidential campaign
that prominently features Trump and a host of similar-minded Republicans
competing for the base he secured remains to be seen. The 70-year-old
Putin, in office since 1999 and frequently referred to as "president for
life," may conclude he has only to wait out Biden's promises of
steadfast support for Ukraine. But for Putin to follow through on
launching a nuclear attack, he would have to believe that doing so would
achieve a military objective that outweighs the surefire response of a
conventional military response from NATO, as well as the ensured
international isolation from what few partners Russia has left --
chiefly in China and India, where leaders have warned Putin against
nuclear weapons use. [With[**in** Russia]{.mark}, the **[war is not
popular]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though polling suggests Putin has not
yet lost the faith of the majority of ordinary Russians. Still,
[[reports emerge]{.mark} regularly [about]{.mark} the **[lack of
confidence]{.mark}** Russian [troops have in]{.mark} their
[leaders]{.mark} up the chain of command]{.underline} -- leading some
analysts to even speculate whether generals charged with executing
nuclear launch orders would comply with their directives. [Using
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** also **[wouldn't achieve
Putin's]{.mark} battlefield [aims]{.mark}**. Russian military [doctrine
calls for]{.mark} the use of low-yield nuclear [warheads as a]{.mark}
**last-ditch [tactic]{.mark}**]{.underline} to punch a hole in enemy
lines that mechanized infantry could then exploit. "[The problem is
[Russian forces are **utterly degraded**]{.mark}, absolutely
shattered]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She notes the same is true of the
Ukrainian military but adds that Russia does not currently have a single
deployable division of troops that could carry out that level of
operations. "[Then [factor in NATO retaliation]{.mark} for violating the
nuclear taboo]{.underline}, likely to include conventional missile
strikes on Russian headquarters, ammunition depots and storage
facilities within Ukraine," she says. "[[You've]{.mark} just [**lost**
the operational advantage]{.mark} you might have gained by using
low-yield nuclear weapons]{.underline} -- even if you use 10 or 15."
This scenario, however, exists within Russian offensive operations.
Lawlor adds these circumstances could change if Russia feels it is
squarely in a defensive position and needs to prevent "all-out
disaster." "You have to think about the human response to nuclear use,"
she says, describing the effect on a Ukrainian soldier who witnesses a
rising mushroom cloud several miles away toward the front lines. "The
symbolism is really important in that the Russians may assume it would
have a devastating effect on the morale of the surviving Ukrainian
forces," Lawlor says. "At this stage in the war, though, it's not even
under consideration because the Russians are still conducting offensive
operations." At least some of those who have engaged with Putin directly
agree. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed earlier this month
that he had received direct warnings from Putin of nuclear war. "He
threatened me at one point, and he said, \'Boris, I don\'t want to hurt
you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute,\' or something
like that. Jolly," the conservative politician told the BBC. Johnson
later explained to Fox News that he believed that what Putin was "trying
to do was creep me out ... trying to reduce it to a story about a
nuclear standoff between Russia and NATO." He [[argued]{.mark} that
[**Putin understands** the **devastating effect** on **Russia** if it
were to launch nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Q: Is the U.S. effectively at war with Russia?]{.underline}
D\'Anieri**[: No. There is a big gap]{.underline}**, [well-understood on
all sides, between arming an ally and directly engaging with
Russia.]{.underline} There were many parallel examples during the Cold
War when the U.S. and Soviet Union (Russia) aided each other's enemies
without directly getting involved, and while this didn't always make the
other side happy, it was never seen as direct attack[. In fact, the
[U.S. and Russia]{.mark}n militaries have **for decades**]{.underline}
[[been]{.underline}]{.mark} **[very [careful]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to
avoid]{.mark} [direct]{.mark}ly [shooting]{.mark} at one
another,]{.underline} **[for fear of where it might end.]{.underline}**
Q: [Are we close to full-scale world war?]{.underline} D\'Anieri: [No.
The U.S. has **not attacked**]{.underline} [Russia and Russia has **not
attacked** the U.S., and neither of those things is **even remotely
likely at this point.**]{.underline} Q: [What is the price of
[Russian]{.mark} military [strikes]{.mark} on U.S. soil?]{.underline} Is
there a more likely course of Russian retaliation against the U.S.?
D\'Anieri: [Such an attack must be regarded as **[extremely
unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [If such an attack were to
take place, the [U.S. would]{.mark}]{.underline} **[likely seek to
[respond]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in a way that is
**proportional**]{.underline} [but **not escalatory.**]{.underline}
[[**Uncertainty** about]{.mark} what would lead to]{.underline}
[**[escalation]{.underline}** [explains]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[why]{.mark} the [U.S. and Russia take]{.mark}]{.underline} **[such
[care]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to avoid]{.mark} direct
[combat]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even as they **support competing
sides**]{.underline} in some conflicts. Russia has sought to intervene
in U.S. elections in the past, and likely will continue to do so. One
might also expect cyber attacks, but we have not seen them thus far in
this war. That suggests the [[Russians understand]{.mark} that
[they]{.mark} **too [are vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is also
quite likely that [with Russian forces already **overextended** fighting
against **Ukraine**, [Russian leaders realize]{.mark} that a [**second
major conflict** is not in their interest]{.mark}.]{.underline} Q:
Checking in at 14 months, how heavy is the cost of war for Russia, in
terms of the human toll and economics? Has Russia made resource and
allocation adjustments in the past months that will allow it to sustain
these losses? D\'Anieri: Russia's recent war efforts appear to be
unsustainable. They have lost large numbers of soldiers and expended
significant amounts of ammunition, such that commanders in the field are
complaining about shortages and are suggesting that they may soon have
to switch from offense to defense, which is less costly in terms of
people and materiel. Overall, the Russian economy is holding up. Growth
is very slow, and shortages of various imported goods are mounting, but
there are no signs that economic factors will severely constrain the war
effort any time soon. However, it would appear that [before the Russian
military could undertake **another large-scale offensive**]{.underline},
[a significant **program of recruitment**,]{.underline}
**[training]{.underline}**, [and **re-arming**]{.underline} [would need
to take place]{.underline}. [It appears that [Russia **cannot
retake**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the offensive]{.mark} in
2023.]{.underline}

Conclusion

Indeed, something is happening in [[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
the transformation into a new 'El Dorado' has not yet crystallised. The
region [[did not become the **maritime highway**]{.mark}, **resource
arena** [or **military theatre**]{.mark} that [some were fantasising
about]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are different reasons to the current
development. [[On **economic** matters]{.underline}]{.mark} such as
shipping and resource exploitation, [[geophysical conditions **remain
harsh**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [There is still a large gap between the
**potential** of shorter sea lanes for commercial shipping and the
**real volumes transiting these routes**]{.underline}. [**Uncertainty**
plays a large role as climate variability needs to be incorporated as a
risk factor in competing with well-established supply chains following
southern shipping routes]{.underline}. Moreover, it will take time
before supply chains will be adjusted towards new shipping routes and a
knowledge base will have to be created about Arctic environments and
shipping. There are, however, factors which could increase this
transition. These factors include more rapid warming of the Arctic
and/or the increase of security risks on other major shipping routes
such as the Suez Canal and the Strait of Malacca.

With regards to the development of petroleum and natural gas resources,
[[the **fall in the price of oil**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in 2014 [has
had a large impact]{.mark} on new and existing projects in the Arctic.
**[Large projects]{.mark}** in both Russia and Alaska [have been
**delayed**]{.mark}]{.underline} [as the]{.underline} business [case of
[these projects has **difficulty justifying the large investments
needed**]{.mark}]{.underline} to realise them. The main issue of Arctic
resource development is the large investment needed in infrastructure
and technology. Most likely, Russia and China will have the most
geopolitical incentive to continue large projects in the Arctic.

On militarisation, [the Arctic States have indeed developed an armed
presence in the region, but it is not as important as it
was]{.underline} back [in the **Cold War**]{.underline} period.
**[[Institutionalisation of coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** [between
the different powers [has created **understanding**]{.mark}]{.underline}
about the interests of one another [and]{.underline} these [[interests
seem]{.mark} to be [more secured by **peace** and **stability**
than]{.mark} by **[confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Once again, the
cost of equipment able to operate in the region also plays a role.

**No Arctic war.**

A Battle for Resources?

[Most of the resources in the Arctic are to be found in countries within
**territorial seas** or **exclusive economic zones**]{.underline}.
[Since all the Arctic States have pledged to respect UNCLOS]{.underline}
in the Illulissat Declaration, [[there is **very little chance of
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The principle of precaution seems to be
the reason explaining the disputes about the delimitation of the
extended continental shelves, in case something would be found even if
it is unlikely. [Some feared that [a]{.mark} "**[resources driven
conflict]{.mark}**" would occur]{.underline} in the Circumpolar North
after the outbreak of the Ukrainian Crisis; [the phenomenon [did **not
occur**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reason is that [for its own
development, [Moscow **needs the region to remain
peaceful**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Käpylä & Mikkola 2015;
Rahbek-Clemmensen 2015). Given Gazprom's earlier decision to involve the
Norwegian StatoilHydro in the development phase of its Arctic Shtokman
gas field, it can even be argued that [Russia will **need to cooperate**
with its Arctic neighbours to develop its Arctic resources
successfully]{.underline}.

Currently, the main producer of petroleum in the Arctic is Russia, where
the offshore Prirazlomnoye field in the Pechora Sea is operated by
Gazprom Neft. This field, which began commercial production in 2013, had
an output of 2.1 million tons of Arctic oil in 2016. In March 2016, the
Goliat field in Norway, a joint venture between Eni and Statoil, started
production of Arctic oil. This field will produce 100,000 barrels of oil
per day. With regards to natural gas, the Snøhvit gas field operated by
Statoil represents the first and primary offshore development in the
Arctic Barents Sea. The giant Russian natural gas field of Shtokman has
dealt with several setbacks mostly from technological challenges, cost
overruns and low gas prices. The cooperation agreement with European
partners Total and Statoil expired in 2012 and further project
development and production start is delayed until further notice.
Another major Arctic Russian natural gas field, Yamal, has experienced
similar setbacks in development. However, as of April 2014, the field
operated by Novatek plans to start producing gas condensate.

In the North American Arctic, increased Arctic natural gas production
can become a reality with the proposed investments in the 'Alaska
Pipeline Project' through a consortium involving ExxonMobil,
ConocoPhillips, BP and TransCanada. This major infrastructure project
would make it possible to transport the natural gas in Alaska's large
Arctic reserves to markets in Canada and the United States. However, the
planned continuation of this high investment project depends for a large
part on high oil and gas prices. A prolonged period of low oil and gas
prices could lead to a delay of the project which is proposed to begin
transporting natural gas by 2025. The largest oil field in the American
Arctic, in Prudhoe Bay, already reached peak production more than two
decades ago. A second field in the Alaskan Arctic is the 'Alpine field',
developed by ConocoPhillips and which has produced oil since 2000. The
extent to which new production fields are to be developed in the Arctic
is to a large extent dependent on a recovery of oil prices and domestic
policies making a trade-off between environmental objections and the
benefits of domestic resource production. In 2015, Royal Dutch Shell,
one of the major players in the American Arctic, decided to abandon its
drilling operations in the Arctic amid sustained low oil prices and
rising pressure about environmental consequences. In October 2016, a
large oil discovery was made in the Alaskan Arctic by Caelus Energy.
This project, expected to start producing oil by 2022, could potentially
offset some of the production declines from the other Arctic oil fields.

In Greenland, oil and gas development is a potential road towards full
independence from the Kingdom of Denmark. To that purpose, a national
oil company, Nunaoil, has been established; it has an automatic 12.5
percent stake in new oil exploration projects and an option to become a
shareholder in oil projects which move to the development phase. Among
the companies which have actively engaged in exploration activities in
the Greenlandic Arctic are ExxonMobil, Chevron, Statoil, Husky Energy
and Cairn Energy. However, also in Greenland, the drop in the oil price
in 2014 has had a large effect on prospective Arctic oil exploration
activities. Total petroleum prospecting, exploration and exploitation
licences (in force) have decreased from nine in 2014 to three in 2015
and zero in 2016 (Mineral Licence and Safety Authority, 2017). The
Scottish energy company Cairns Energy, one of the major players in
Greenland's petroleum exploration, is evaluating its Greenlandic
portfolio as no commercial oil players have been found yet. In 2014,
Statoil decided not to extend three of its four Greenlandic exploration
licences.

[Asian emerging powers have expressed their interest in Arctic
resources]{.underline}. However, [their contribution to Arctic economic
development **remains modest**]{.underline}. China, Japan and South
Korea are investing in resources exploration in Greenland (Tonami,
2016). Both [China and Japan have expressed their will to cooperate with
Russian companies]{.underline} and have also expressed their will to
invest in the Yamal's liquified natural gas exploitation. However, [the
discussions are advancing at a **really slow pace**]{.underline}.
(Pollmann, 2016; Sorensen and Klimenko, 2017).

Arctic Militarisation?

If we analysed the numbers provided by the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (Wezeman, October 16), we can see that Russia is
leading in terms of air and sea capacities, while Canada has the
strongest land capabilities but strongly lacks specific Arctic
capacities such as icebreakers.

It is interesting to draw a comparison between the current military
activities and the Cold War to get some more insight about what happens
today in the Arctic. The numbers gathered by Lassi Heininen, Alexander
Sergunin and Gleb Yarovoy:

If one observes the data closely, one can draw the following conclusion:

USSR's presence in the 80s outnumbers the current Russian presence. The
same can be said for the US.

NATO has more submarines, lager ships and aircraft that are Arctic
capable than Russia. The mention "Arctic capable" is important; these
forces can be elsewhere and are not permanently stationed in the region.
Russia, thus, remains the strongest Arctic power.

[Although there is a military presence, we cannot speak about a military
theatre like the region has witnessed during the **Cold
War**.]{.underline} The reason behind the Russian military presence in
the region is threefold: 1) to assert Moscow's sovereignty over the
region 2) to protect the Russian companies operating in the region and
3) to show the entire world that Russia is still an Arctic power. Thus,
the [[Russian military presence in the region is tied to]{.mark}
**prestige**, [**economics** and **energy
