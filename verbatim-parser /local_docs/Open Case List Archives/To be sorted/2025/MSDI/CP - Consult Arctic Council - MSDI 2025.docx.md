\"My article studied the practices of legitimation and delegitimation of
two important countries -- [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
and China]{.underline}. It looked at discursive practices: what these
countries say to [[increase or decrease]{.mark} people\'s belief in the
[**legitimacy** of the **Arctic Council**]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
Nicholas Olczak explained to the SCGG website last week.

He went on to describe how \"the study also looked at what shapes these
practices: what political developments around the world make these two
countries say particular things about the Arctic Council.\"

Note: In this article, Nicholas Olczak\'s responses are referred to as
\"NO\" (e.g., NO:).

What are the key findings of your recent study?

NO: \"The study made two main findings.

First, it found that over time the US and China vary greatly in the
amount they say to increase, and also to decrease, people's beliefs
about the legitimacy of the Arctic Council. While people usually expect
the US to largely bolster the legitimacy of the Arctic Council, and
China to challenge its legitimacy, the study found that this was not
really the case.

Second, it found that the amount that the US and China said to increase
or decrease people's beliefs was connected with political developments
taking place around the world. Developments in global environmental
politics made both the US and China produce greater numbers of
statements that boosted the Arctic Council's legitimacy. Meanwhile,
increasing security tensions between countries made both of them produce
more statements which challenged the organization's legitimacy.\"

Why is it important to keep the Arctic Council\'s work alive?

NO: \"[The Arctic is changing rapidly. Global climate change means the
region is warming at four times the global average, leading to extensive
melting of the Arctic sea ice. This melting ice is creating **new
economic opportunities** in the region, with a northern **shipping
route** increasingly possible, as well as extraction of **resources** in
areas of seabed previously covered over by ice sheets. Countries from
all across the world are **eager** to **benefit** from these new
opportunities.]{.underline}

\"Global climate change means the region is warming at four times the
global average, leading to extensive melting of the Arctic sea ice\"

[At the same time, the region, which has long been an exceptional
**'zone of peace'** is increasingly involved in **geopolitical
tensions** between different countries. Managing these extensive
changes, and ensuring that they do not lead to **open conflict** or
harmful consequences, requires forms of governance that are inclusive
and widely supported by different stakeholders. [The **Arctic
Council**]{.mark}, established in 1996 with this role in mind, [remains
the **primary institution** for]{.mark} **providing
[governance]{.mark}** [over this region]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is also
an organization which, through its system of granting observer status to
different countries and organizations, draws together almost all of the
main stakeholders involved in the region.\"

How have actions by the US and China, in legitimizing or delegitimizing
the Arctic Council, influenced its ability to govern?

NO: \"Research has increasingly shown that governance organizations,
such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and also [[the
Arctic Council need a **high level of legitimacy**]{.mark} in the eyes
of different audiences in order [to operate effectively]{.mark}. If the
organizations lack this kind of broader social legitimacy, then [people
will not **comply** with rules made]{.mark} and measures taken [by
them]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"Governance organizations need a high level of legitimacy in the eyes
of different audiences in order to operate effectively\"

When an organization does not have this legitimacy, people will not
support representatives from their country participating in the
activities carried out by this organization. [The things which [the
US]{.mark} and China say about the Arctic Council will be **received**
by wider audiences, both domestically within the two countries and
overseas in other countries, and can potentially **[impact]{.mark}** on
the extent to which members of these audiences believe in [the
**legitimacy** of the organization]{.mark}.]{.underline}\"

[The [Arctic]{.mark} is saturated with [**nuclear facilities**
bring]{.mark}ing both benefits for regional economic and social
development and [**risks** of nuclear]{.mark} and radiological
**[accidents]{.mark}** and concerns about radioactive
wastes]{.underline}. There is every reason to expect the Arctic will
remain a nuclearized region during the foreseeable future. This makes it
important to direct attention to issues of nuclear safety and security
in the region. [We identify several clusters of these issues in the
Arctic, including the challenges of potential **nuclear accidents**, the
handling of spent nuclear fuel and [radioactive **waste**]{.mark}, the
[cleanup of]{.mark} **radiological [contaminants]{.mark}**[, and
concerns about **nuclear security**]{.mark}. An analysis of
international conventions and voluntary codes of conduct shows that they
are applicable to Arctic nuclear safety and security, but only in
general terms]{.underline}. This suggests a [[need]{.mark} for [an
**Arctic-specific agreement** on]{.mark} nuclear and radiological
[safety, emergency preparedness]{.mark} and [response, and
cleanup]{.mark} of radiological contaminants]{.underline}. The outbreak
of military hostilities in [[Ukraine]{.mark} in February 2022 [has
**disrupted normal procedures**]{.mark} for addressing issues of common
concern in the Arctic. [But the need for **co-operation**
regarding]{.mark} matters like [nuclear safety]{.mark} and security
[will not go away]{.mark}]{.underline}. Assuming it is possible to
devise "necessary modalities" for restarting the work of the Arctic
Council following the acute phase of the Ukraine crisis, [[an
Arctic-specific agreement]{.mark} on nuclear safety and security [could
be developed under the **auspices of the Arctic Council**, which already
has taken an interest in nuclear safety through the]{.mark} activities
of its **[Working Group on Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and
Response]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Once such an agreement is in place, it
will become important to consider the infrastructure needed to ensure
that its provisions are implemented effectively.

[[Russia's **nuclear development** of the Arctic continues]{.mark}
apace, but with the country [**cut off** from]{.mark} regional
**[cooperation initiatives]{.mark}** and foreign funding, many worry [it
may **struggle to respond to a nuclear emergency**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The war in [Ukraine]{.mark} continues to [drain Russia's **resources
away** from]{.mark} critical areas, including **[nuclear
security]{.mark} in the Arctic**]{.underline}. [Despite this,
Moscow]{.underline} remains committed to the development of this
strategic region, and [has not stopped building nuclear sites
there]{.underline}. In September, Norway detected elevated levels of
radioactive Cesium-137 near its Arctic border with Russia. As Russia is
no longer cooperating with other nations on nuclear safety in the
Arctic, this is unlikely to be the last such report.

Around the same time that Norway reported the surge in radiation levels,
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused NATO of militarizing the
Arctic through increasingly frequent crisis response exercises. Yet
Russia is guilty of the same. Its new foreign policy concepts and
doctrines call the Arctic "a vital area for ensuring our national
interests in the global ocean," and Moscow has warned that it will use
"any means necessary" to secure its interests there. Those means include
the Northern Fleet, whose ships regularly---and conspicuously---traverse
the Arctic Ocean, training to counter Western submarines.

Particularly crucial to Russia's plans is its fleet of nuclear
submarines, which has become significantly more active in northern
waters in the past decade. The fleet consists of twelve strategic
nuclear submarines carrying up to 192 nuclear-capable ballistic
missiles, twenty-four nuclear submarines armed with cruise missiles, and
ten special-purpose nuclear submarines, with another twelve nuclear
submarines under construction or nearly ready for commission.

The Arctic is also a testing ground for new nuclear-powered,
nuclear-armed weapons---from the Burevestnik cruise missile to the
Poseidon torpedo---contributing to both regional tensions and the risk
of radiation accidents.

That risk is growing, not only because of Russia's military activities,
but also because of its increasing economic activity in the Arctic.
[**[Rosatom]{.mark}, the state nuclear company**, operates the
eight-ship nuclear icebreaker fleet that is key to the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}, along which 36 million tons of cargo were
transported in 2023, up from 4 million in 2014. That number is expected
to reach 270 million tons in 2035, while the nuclear icebreaker fleet is
to expand by seven more vessels.

[Rosatom's footprint in the Arctic extends to Russia's **two nuclear
power plants** there: **Kola and Bilibino**. They do not generate enough
energy for the country's Arctic development needs (the region contains
trillions of cubic meters of natural gas and billions of tons of oil),
for which Rosatom [estimates]{.mark} that [no fewer than **fifteen
f**]{.mark}**loating [n]{.mark}uclear [p]{.mark}ower
[p]{.mark}lant[s]{.mark}** [are **required**]{.mark}. The company
separately [plans to build several]{.mark} small modular reactors
(**[SMRs]{.mark}**)]{.underline}, the first of which should be up and
running by 2028.

[In the past five years, [Russia's]{.mark} development of the Arctic has
seen the [number of]{.mark} civil and military nuclear [reactors in the
region increase by **30 percent**]{.mark}, from sixty-two to eighty-one.
[By **2035**]{.mark}, it is estimated [there may be
**118**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In response to growing concerns about nuclear safety, Rosatom has
offered reassurances on SMRs' passive safety systems. But
environmentalists stress that [[SMRs are]{.mark} experimental, and
therefore **[high-risk]{.mark}**. Of [particular concern is]{.mark} how
they will be **[transport]{.mark}ed**. It has already been reported that
ships not designed to transport nuclear materials have been used to do
just that, and further nuclear safety violations cannot be ruled
out]{.underline}. In addition, a 2022 study found that SMRs produce more
radioactive waste than conventional nuclear power plants.

[The Arctic's [**radiation risks** are]{.mark} therefore [only
**rising**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The situation was far from ideal to
begin with, thanks to the region's rich Soviet nuclear inheritance.
There are some 18,000 sunken assets that were or remain dangerously
radioactive, a thousand of which continue to pose a threat. They include
submarines, reactors, and high-level waste. In addition, the Russian
Arctic is peppered with facilities for storing nuclear fuel---fresh and
spent alike---and refining it.

[[Ensuring]{.mark} the [safety]{.mark} of new nuclear assets and
managing the Soviet nuclear inheritance [is **difficult and
expensive**]{.mark}, and an endeavor in which [Russia used to work
closely with **foreign partners**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It was not
uncommon for projects to be 50 percent or even 60 percent foreign
funded, and some were wholly financed from abroad. The Bellona
Foundation estimates that Russia received some \$2.5 billion in
international assistance in this area, in addition to all the political,
technological, informational, and other support from which it benefited.

[Years of **[international coop]{.mark}eration** on nuclear security
[ended with the invasion of Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia was cut
off from foreign funding, not only bilaterally but also through EU and
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development programs. Technical
assistance dried up as well, precluding the maintenance of foreign
equipment and halting the supply of spare parts.

Institutions also stopped working together, with Russia leaving the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council and being suspended from the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development's Nuclear Energy Agency. The
European Technical Safety Organisations Network cut ties with Russia's
Scientific and Engineering Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety.

[Crucially, it has become more [difficult for Russia to
**respond**]{.mark} **promptly** [to **nuclear emergencies**]{.mark}.
The [Arctic]{.mark} is marked by **[extreme weather]{.mark}**
conditions, [**huge distances**, and **poor infrastructure**]{.mark}.
Notifying partners of a **nuclear incident** as soon as possible is of
the utmost importance, so that complicated interagency and
**international coordination** may commence]{.underline}. Yet Russia is
out of the Norwegian-led Arctic and North Atlantic Security and
Emergency Preparedness Network and is no longer invited to nuclear
incident response exercises, even as an observer.

As the 2000 Kursk submarine disaster made painfully clear, Russia was
never inclined to accept outside assistance in nuclear emergencies.
However, cooperation with partners was at least theoretically possible.
[Now, [any prospect of a **regional agreement on nuclear
security**]{.mark} **in the Arctic** [establishing]{.mark} a **joint
[emergency response]{.mark}** mechanism [is]{.mark} as good as
**[dead]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Rosatom admits that [Russia being cut off from foreign funding means
projects related to nuclear safety in the Arctic will **stall**. Yet it
maintains that they **will not be canceled** altogether]{.underline},
which would seem plausible given the company's financials.

However, in practice, funding is being cut, and the results are clear.
Hitherto largely financed by Norway, [efforts to remove solid
**radioactive waste** from Andreyeva Bay may be **suspended
indefinitely**]{.underline}, Bellona experts fear.

Rosatom's accounts show that nuclear safety is not a priority. Federal
spending on nuclear and radiation safety has steadily been falling since
about 2020, and is expected to be cut by a further 1.5 billion rubles
between 2024 and 2026. Cuts of 2.3 billion rubles are planned for
efforts related to radioactive waste disposal and management and the
cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. At the same time, tariffs for the
disposal of radioactive waste are to increase by an average of 33
percent by 2027.

The opacity of the Russian state does not help matters. [Gone are the
days when many projects were implemented with the involvement of NGOs,
and Rosatom's disclosures offer so little information as to be useless
as a guide to Russia's plans for the cleanup of nuclear legacy
sites]{.underline}.

[The same concerns extend to Russia's **response to nuclear
emergencies**. Since many sites are operated by the military or
considered key to national security, gathering information about
incidents is extremely difficult]{.underline}.

[Before the war, the prospect of a nuclear accident in the Arctic seemed
remote. It was only slightly easier to imagine one involving a nuclear
vessel or a floating nuclear power plant. Today, the situation is
deteriorating rapidly, as [Russia continues to build new nuclear]{.mark}
sites [while **halting**]{.mark} **the [cleanup of]{.mark} nuclear
[legacy sites]{.mark}**. [The absence of]{.mark} **international
assistance** and **[regional coop]{.mark}eration**, along [with]{.mark}
the [dwindling attention paid to **nuclear safety**]{.mark} in the
Arctic by the federal authorities, [spells]{.mark} further
**[trouble]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[That the risks are growing is no concern to Russia, which may in fact
see the peril of its development of the Arctic as a **feature**, not a
bug. It could form part of its **policy of blackmail**, with Russia
taking things to the **brink to force concessions** from the West such
as the resumption of financing and technical
assistance]{.underline}---irrespective of developments on other fronts.

While the world focuses on managing the consequences of novel
coronavirus, other **[[global risk]{.mark}s]{.underline}** warrant
political attention. As the sea ice retreats and the permafrost
collapses due to climate change, the [[growing **nuclearisation** of
the]{.mark} Russian [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} should be high on this
list.

[The largest **concentration** of nuclear installations -- both civilian
and military -- is in **Northern Russia**]{.underline}. During the Cold
War, the Soviet Union kept a significant portion of its nuclear weapons
arsenal in the Arctic, carried out extensive nuclear weapons testing at
Novaya Zemlya, and used its waters as nuclear dump sites.1 Russia's
inability to effectively deal with this nuclear legacy created the
potential for an environmental catastrophe and became a major post-Cold
War challenge.2 During the period 1996- 2006, defence agencies of the
United States and Norway -- later joined by the United Kingdom -- worked
with Russia to jointly manage transboundary radioactive waste issues
under the aegis of the Arctic Military Environmental Cooperation (AMEC)
program.3

Today, almost three decades after the international cleanup started, [a
new generation of nuclear reactors are coming to the
Arctic]{.underline}. In 2019, The Independent Barents Observer reported
that there are 39 nuclear-powered vessels or installations in the
Russian Arctic, with a total of 62 reactors.4

This is set to increase considerably over the next 15 years. According
to some estimates, [[the Russian Arctic will constitute the most
nuclearised waters on the planet by **2035**]{.underline}]{.mark}.5

[[Russia's]{.mark} poor record on nuclear management, coupled with
[**insufficient emergency preparedness** capabilities in the Arctic,
raises]{.mark} safety [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}. These include
[potential [incidents involving **nuclear contamination**]{.mark}, which
could [severely harm the Arctic]{.mark} marine [environment and
population]{.mark} alike, [and pose a **serious threat to Russia,
Europe, and**]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially **[[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**. We should not wait to put in place early
warning and transparency mechanisms that reduce the [[risk]{.mark}s of
[a **dangerous nuclear incident**]{.mark} **in the
Arctic**]{.underline}.

2\. Second, existing [[agreements need]{.mark} to be **strengthened** or
**[supplemented]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Russia is party to the IAEA
Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, which applies to
nuclear accidents that result in "international transboundary release"
of radioactive material that could be of "radiological safety
significance" for another state.45 Any accident that meets those
conditions must be reported -- be it civilian or military. Russia is
also a signatory to the IAEA Convention on Nuclear Safety, which
addresses the safety of land-based nuclear reactors.46 While the
Convention excludes military and marine power reactors, its
applicability to transportable and floating nuclear power plants needs
to be clarified.47

3\. Third, [there is a [need]{.mark} for **strategic [engagement with
Russia to minimise nuclear risks in the Arctic]{.mark}**. The
[establishment of a **dedicated expert group** on]{.mark} nuclear
[emergencies within the **Arctic Council**]{.mark} in December last year
[constitutes a **step in the right direction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.48
[[The group]{.mark} brings together experts from all eight Arctic states
in order to [**advance emergency prevention**, **preparedness** and
**response capabilities**]{.mark} among the Arctic states [in the event
of]{.mark} radiological and nuclear
**[incidents]{.mark}**]{.underline}.49

4\. Fourth, to address the risks of unintended military incidents
involving nuclear weapons, it is important to define what is deemed
tolerable and acceptable military practice in the region and what is
not. Creating a military Code of Conduct for the Arctic, and including
Russia, is the best way forward.50 In addition, a separate TCBM
agreement involving all Arctic states could be negotiated. Such an
agreement could build on the principles embodied in the Open Skies
Treaty, the Vienna Document 2011, the Incidents at Sea (INCSEA)
Agreement, the Agreement on Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities
(DMA), and other CBM agreements that are intended to reduce the risks of
conflict arising from failure of communication, misunderstanding, and
lack of mutual transparency.51 The agreement could eventually open to
all states that conduct shipping and air operations in the Arctic.

5\. Fifth, in addition to information and knowledge sharing, [it is
important for Arctic states to identify preparedness and response
**[arrangements and capabilities]{.mark}** that are needed in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [Coordination and joint planning for response to
nuclear emergencies [is **essential**]{.mark}]{.underline}, much like
the work of the Arctic Coast Guard Forum (ACGF) to plan for oil spills,
search and rescue, and non-nuclear shipping incidents. [A legally
binding [Arctic Council]{.mark} cooperation [agreement on radiation
emergencies]{.mark}]{.underline} -- modelled on existing agreements on
oil pollution and search and rescue -- [could [open the door for
**multinational exercises**, better **exchange of info**]{.mark}rmation,
[and **plans** for]{.mark} coordinated [response]{.mark} in the event of
maritime radiological and nuclear **accidents**]{.underline}.52

A. Collective Action of the Arctic Council

Given the rapidly changing landscape and the legitimate basis of
environmental protection as justification for extraterritorial actions
codified in UNCLOS, [[the Arctic States need]{.mark} to work from [a
**common set of facts**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As regional warming
changes the "facts on the ground," [the Arctic [could become a
**battleground** over competing]{.mark} scientific
[interpretations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A common set of facts is not just an ideal policy, it is also written
into the text of at least one UNCLOS provision at issue. Article 234,
which extends a coastal state's enforcement powers "for the protection
of the marine environment in generally ice-covered areas" also requires
that such regulations have "due regard to \[ . . . \] the protection and
preservation of the marine environment based on the best available
scientific evidence."180 [As states continue to chafe at the regulations
imposed by Canada and Russia, and potentially others, [they could **seek
out**]{.mark} **competing [science]{.mark}** [that suggests]{.mark} the
regulatory [measures are **unnecessary**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This will
become more readily apparent as melting ice eases transit, and
potentially removes states' justifications for environmental protection
measures. Escalation--- such as a ship refusing the escort of Russian
icebreakers, and the Russians' possible responses---is not hard to
imagine. The delimitation of a state's continental shelf is also a
highly scientific process, in which slightly different measurement
points can have vastly divergent outcomes. With the resources at stake,
states have every incentive to use the most advantageous measurements
possible.

Through information-gathering and -sharing, [[the A]{.mark}rctic
[C]{.mark}ouncil['s]{.mark} different **[working groups]{.mark}** are
positioned to [**provide** these common facts. The Council's
research]{.mark}, which can be presumed to be [**accepted** by
all]{.mark} the Arctic States, can [provide the **basis** for
joint]{.mark} environmental [protections]{.mark} enforced collectively
by the Arctic States]{.underline}. It can also provide legitimate
grounds for new regulations which some scholars have recommended the
Arctic States pursue through the IMO.

[[Rather than]{.mark} throwing open the door to economic
development]{.underline}, which will inevitably [alter the
region]{.underline}, [and [trying to manage it]{.mark} individually [on
**a case-by-case basis**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the Arctic States can
**[establish regional standards]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Exerting
regional leadership will [have the dual effect]{.mark} of (1)
[**reinforcing** the]{.mark} Arctic [Council's role as
**gatekeeper**]{.mark} to the region [and]{.mark} (2) [**standardizing
regulations** in the interest of promoting]{.mark} consistent,
[sustainable]{.mark} economic **[development]{.mark}** in line with the

An FNPP is defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as a
"transportable and/or relocatable nuclear power plant which, when
fuelled, is capable of producing final energy products, such as
electricity, heat, and desalinated water" \[6\]. [As an effective
**combination** of **small modular reactor** technology with ships and
**floating platform projects**, an **FNPP** is often deployed in coastal
waters and serves as a transportable nuclear power plant]{.underline} to
provide an effective energy supply for remote islands and offshore oil
and gas exploration platforms \[7\]. FNPPs can also be used for seawater
desalination, providing large quantities of fresh water to coastal
cities that are highly water-scarce.

Several countries have developed or are developing FNPPs. For example,
the United States began operating its first FNPP---the Sturgis---in the
1960s. In 2022, the United States Department of Energy provided funding
for a three-year research study on FNPPs \[8\]. Russia began building
its FNPP---the Akademik Lomonosov---in 2007, and the platform started
operation in December 2019 \[9\]. China has incorporated the
construction of FNPPs into its national energy strategy to address the
energy shortage issues that have restricted the country's maritime
activities and plans to deploy twenty FNPPs in the South China Sea
\[10,11\].

Although nuclear energy is low-carbon-emission clean energy \[12--15\],
FNPPs may have other special marine environmental risks. Deploying and
developing FNPPs may not only pose challenges in terms of "safe storage

[[US-Russia talks]{.mark} in Saudi Arabia and the Trump-Putin phone call
[signal a possible **negotiation for peace in Ukraine**]{.mark} and new
opportunities for the countries' **relations**, including [in the
**Arctic**]{.mark} region]{.underline}.

world by **[bring]{.mark}ing [an end]{.mark}** [to the]{.mark}
disastrous [war in **Ukraine**]{.mark} and reducing the risk of nuclear
war]{.underline}, but existential environmental issues still demand
attention.

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

[At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, [Kirill
Dmitriev]{.mark}, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, [named the
region as a potential **setting for US-Russia coop**]{.mark}**eration**:
"We need to pursue joint projects, including, for example, in the
Arctic." The Arctic region makes sense as a setting for cooperation [as
the two sides have **explicitly expressed interest in exploring
cooperation**]{.mark} in energy, investment, and geopolitical
issues]{.underline}. Western sanctions on Russia have led Moscow to step
up its cooperation in the Arctic with China in joint energy ventures and
grand plans for Arctic shipping. US officials now see Arctic cooperation
as a potential means to "drive a wedge" between Moscow and Beijing.

In my meetings in Moscow with American and Russian diplomats and
businessmen over the past few weeks, it is clear that many are
interested in diverse forms of Arctic cooperation, from cultural
diplomacy that celebrates the commonalities of Indigenous peoples on
both sides of the Bering Strait, to scientific diplomacy to understand
and adapt to climate hazards faced by both nations. Business interests,
however, are at the top of the agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the countries' diplomatic missions will significantly reduce the
current obstacles to US-Russia scientific cooperation in the Arctic. By
making it easier to issue visas and travel between the two countries,
Americans and Russians will again be able to conduct joint research,
expeditions, and scientific conferences and build models to better
understand the unfolding climate emergency. Scientific cooperation to
understand the changes affecting sea ice, permafrost, ecosystems, and
local communities has been blunted by the political fallout of the war
in Ukraine.

[Cooperation in [the Arctic can]{.mark} help [build]{.mark} **regional
[stability]{.mark}**. More importantly, Arctic cooperation will build
trust between the US and Russia that could **complement** or **spill
over** into other crucial fields of cooperation such as arms control,
**Middle East peace**, and global health]{.underline}.

Russian nuclear threats against Ukraine are not credible

The [[fear that Russia might use]{.mark} 'tactical' [**nuclear weapons**
in **Ukraine**]{.mark} reflects a fundamental]{.underline}, but
completely understandable, [**misinterpretation** of what Putin has
said]{.underline} (attempting to deter direct Western
intervention) [and how Russia thinks about nuclear weapons in
war]{.underline}. While it is tempting to believe that Russia's latest
nuclear threats are directed against Ukraine, it is worth noting that,
on the one hand, [Russia has annexed territory it does not currently
hold, and on the other, Putin has **refrained** from issuing a
direct nuclear threat to Ukraine if it did not take up his offer for
talks]{.underline}. Rather, [his messaging was intended to **push the
West** to coerce Ukraine into **negotiations** and to freeze the
battlefield]{.underline} as it is now, which would give Russia time and
space to reconstitute its land forces. If Russia's threat against
Ukraine had been serious, surely the raid on Belgorod, the attack on
Saky Air Base or the bombing of the Kerch Bridge -- in addition to the
regular fighting proceeding along the front lines -- would have been
sufficient to trigger retaliation.

But [such concerns [are not
consistent with Russian **nuclear doctrine** and **force posture**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Russia's operational nuclear doctrine (as opposed to the published
version) focuses on
employment against the possibility of a small nuclear conflict
escalating to a theatre or general war, and the force posture of
Russia's non-strategic nuclear arsenal reflects that mission. Russia
sees non-strategic nuclear use in such escalation-prevention
scenarios -- as well as near-peer theatre-level conflicts -- as a
prescribed 'dose' of violence to 'soberise' the adversary, prevent
it from escalating or coerce it into capitulating. Thus, [[it
is **highly unlikely**]{.mark} that Russia would use nuclear
weapons against Ukrainian targets in this war]{.underline}. It may be
helpful to illustrate the underlying principles of this conclusion by
thinking about tactical nuclear weapon use. This is not to say that
doctrine is determinative, given that in this war Putin has acted in
ways contrary to any rational military doctrine. But most analysts
expect that he would only use nuclear weapons in Ukraine if he something
to gain from doing so.

In order to use tactical nuclear weapons in the current conflict, Russia
would have to answer four questions:

1\) What is the intended target of a nuclear strike?

2\) What is the intended effect on the target?

3\) What type of nuclear weapon would create the intended effect with
the highest efficiency?

4\) What happens next?

As Hoffman and I argued in April, [there are three types of potential
uses for Russian nuclear weapons in its war on Ukraine: 1)
a **demonstration strike**]{.underline} against an unpopulated area such
as the Black Sea; [2) a **counter-force battlefield strike**; and 3)
a **counter-value strike**]{.underline} against a population centre to
seek a political termination of the war, or possible to decapitate
Ukraine's government. [Scenarios 1 and 3 are **vanishingly unlikely**,
as 1 would probably have no effect on Ukraine's will to fight or on
Western support for Ukraine but would give rise to massive global
political opprobrium]{.underline}. Scenario 3 would obviously increase
Ukraine's will to fight and it would also increase global support for
Ukraine's struggle and make Russia and Putin himself a target for defeat
for a massive coalition of countries including states that are currently
neutral or even supportive of the war effort. And, for all three of
these scenarios, the question of what happens next looms. If scenarios 1
and 3 do not end the conflict on Russia's terms, Moscow might well be on
the receiving end of political, economic, and possibly even military
retaliation.

[This leaves scenario 2]{.underline}. Put simply, [however, [there
are **no attractive military targets** for Russian nuclear weapons in
Ukraine]{.mark}. Ukraine does not operate with a large-enough
concentration of forces to justify a 10--100 kiloton blast]{.underline}.
Smaller nuclear weapons would be of even less use, as below 10 kilotons,
their effects are overtaken by those of high-end precision mass-effect
artillery, such as the Tornado-G and -S and the TOS-1M/1A and TOS-2,
especially when using thermobaric warheads. As Janne Korhonen describes
in an excellent Twitter thread, tactical nuclear weapons are far less
decisive in their effects than one might think, and conventional
artillery strikes such as the one at Zelenopillya in July 2014
demonstrate similar levels of effectiveness in combat without breaching
the nuclear taboo, risking global opprobrium, unleashing dangerous
radioactive fallout, or demoralising the soldiers on one's own side. So
Putin has two bad nuclear options before him: either employ multiple
small warheads to achieve a significant battlefield effect (with a real
threat of intervention and escalation), or employ one larger, theatre
nuclear weapon to achieve a political effect (and still risk
intervention and escalation).

[Defeating the Ukrainian army on the battlefield
would require **dozens** of tactical nuclear weapons to achieve
a **decisive military effect**]{.underline} -- not just a single strike.
In fact, the US Army planned to use 136 nuclear strikes to achieve a
decisive result over a 60-mile-long front -- and the frontlines between
Ukraine and Russia now stretch for almost 400 miles. [[The **risks
of radiation**]{.mark} from this many strikes, not to mention
the psychological effects [on Russian soldiers]{.mark} of witnessing
destruction on such a scale, [would
be considerable]{.mark}]{.underline}, reducing their combat
effectiveness and their already-low ability to exploit gaps in Ukrainian
defensive lines. The radiation effects are not to be ignored, with
immediate effects on all soldiers in the open regardless of their
loyalty, as well as [[the]{.underline} [**spread of fallout** into
**occupied Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and into [**Belarus** and
**Russia**]{.mark}, which [would cause panic]{.mark} among
populations]{.underline} already made wary by Ukraine's strikes in
Russia and occupied Crimea. Further, if the intent is to break Ukraine's
will or the West's resolve, any such strikes would fail
utterly. [Breaking the 77-year taboo on [nuclear use]{.mark} in war
[would]{.mark} only **[galvanise]{.mark}** Ukraine and [the
West's **support**]{.mark} for it [while **rallying more
countries**]{.mark} to the cause]{.underline}.

What keeps us up at night

[There is a [**long list** of potential **incidents** that]{.mark}
involve the possible [release]{.mark} of [**radioactive material** in
the]{.mark} Russian [Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Four are highlighted
here. [At the [top of the list is]{.mark} the safety of the **[nuclear
floating station]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the Akademik Lomonosov.
Although Rosatom insists the plant is 'virtually unsinkable',26
environmentalists fear that [it [could be tossed by **waves** in storms,
become **steerless**]{.mark} if the mooring breaks, [or]{.mark} hit an
**iceberg** and [**sink**, causing **substantial
contamination**]{.mark}]{.underline}.27 [Rising storm intensity, fueled
by warming oceans, heightens some of these risks. [Concerns have]{.mark}
also [been raised about the lack of]{.mark} **regulatory
[oversight]{.mark}** [of the plant's]{.mark} construction, testing,
fueling and its **[transport]{.mark}**]{.underline} from the home port
to Pevek.28

Yet the riskiest operations take place within the city limits of
Murmansk. When not operating in ice-covered waters, icebreakers are
docked in the Rosatomflot's service base in Murmansk, where all fresh
and spent nuclear fuel is transported to and from.29 Service ships
storing spent nuclear fuel from the fleet of nuclear icebreakers are
also berthed there.30 "[An accident which releases [radioactivity could
reach **densely populated areas**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Murmansk long
before anyone manages to trigger the emergency evacuation alarm," warns
Thomas Nilsen.31

[The third risk is linked to a potential **nuclear shipping
incident**]{.underline}. Expanding LNG exports from the Yamal Peninsula
have been accompanied by a large increase in nuclear-powered icebreaker
escorts.32 In 2019, nuclear-powered icebreakers accompanied a total of
510 vessels, an increase of 54 percent compared to 2018.33 With global
warming, regular commercial shipping in the Arctic will increase the
likelihood of accidents triggered by extreme weather and climate events,
such as stronger winds, storms, and higher waves. One plausible incident
scenario involves a collision of a foreign-owned LNG tanker and Russian
nuclear-powered icebreaker escort in a winter storm, with a [serious
potential for release of **radioactive contaminants**]{.underline}.34
The recent oil spill in Norilsk, caused by the erosion of the
surrounding permafrost, illustrates the considerable risks that
increasing economic activity can have on the regional environment, as
well as the catastrophic effect climate change is having in the
Arctic.35 Ecological issues can, in turn, accelerate disease spread and
have detrimental effects on human health.

Second, [[when FNPPs encounter]{.mark} special circumstances (such as
[**extreme weather**, **collisions**]{.mark}, external threats,
operational errors, severe machine damage, and
fire/explosion)]{.underline} \[46\], [FNPPs' environmental
[risks]{.mark} may **[heighten]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Once a severe
accident occurs, for example, colliding with ships navigating with high
navigation speed, colliding with rockets, or sinking in shallow water,
there are risks of leaking radioactive pollutants into the marine
environment. [In the event of accidents or other catastrophic events,
"**[nuclear damage]{.mark} could be [of an extreme
magnitude]{.mark}**"]{.underline} \[6\]. [[Leaked radioactive
materials]{.mark} from FNPPs could then **[quickly disperse]{.mark}**

the sea** and [causing]{.mark} detrimental cross-border effects as well
as **[serious harm]{.mark}** to both humans and marine
ecosystems]{.underline} \[6,47\]. Moreover, maritime security threats,
such as terrorist attacks, armed intrusions, and the hijacking of ships,
may also endanger FNPPs and surrounding waters, making physical
protection against external threats vital for the deployment of FNPPs
\[48\]. In addition, without effective training for crew members on
board, [human error-induced accidents are **more likely** to occur on
**FNPPs**]{.underline}. Research shows that human errors are responsible
for most ship accidents \[49\]. The offshore working environment on
FNPPs is more stressful for humans and, compared with land-based nuclear
installations, often lacks enough human resources; consequently,
[**operators of FNPPs** are **more prone** to making **errors**,
inducing nuclear accidents]{.underline} \[48\]. Research shows that some
radioactive leakage from nuclear-powered ships has resulted in emergency
dumping \[50\].

Unlike many [[radioactive materials]{.underline}]{.mark} that degrade
fairly rapidly, some will [[remain **intensely poisonous** for
incredibly long periods]{.underline}]{.mark}. Plutonium-240 (Pu-240) has
a half-life of 6,560 years. The half-life is the time it takes for
radioactive decay to decrease by half. But decay does not occur at an
even pace, and radioactive isotopes are dangerous for much longer --
typically 10 to 20 times the length of their half-life. Pu-238 has an
88-year half-life, and is used for space vehicles despite the frequency
of rocket failures. Any exploding rocket including such cargo spreads
pollution far and wide. Pu-239 has a half-life of over 24,000 years, and
will remain radioactive for about a half a million years. But the
situation is more complicated because as Pu-239 decays it transforms to
[[uranium]{.underline}]{.mark}-235 (U- 235), which [[has a **half
life**]{.mark} of 600 to **[700 million years]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Iodine-129 has a half-life of 16 million years. Pu-244 has a half-life
of 80.8 million years. U-238 has a half- life of 4.5 billion years.2

[When taken into the body, [isotopes]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}of
radioactive plutonium are not fully eliminated and [tend to accumulate.
They [are **deadly** when]{.mark} sufficiently
[accumulated]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pu-239 was described by its
co-discoverer, chemist Glenn Seaborg, as \"fiendishly toxic.\" In
addition to terrible chemical toxicity, plutonium emits ionizing
radiation. Pu-239 emits alpha, beta and gamma particles. Gamma radiation
can penetrate the entire body and kill cells. Pu-239 has a robust
resonance energy of 0.2 96 electron-volts that can [[badly damage DNA
and produce **birth defects** that carry over
generations]{.underline}]{.mark}.3 The body repairs tissues and DNA, but
becomes overwhelmed when plutonium concentrates too heavily.

According to a 1975 article in New Scientist Magazine, "But if it is
inhaled, 10 micrograms of plutonium-239 is likely to cause fatal lung
cancer."4 Experts estimate that Pu-239 is so noxious that only **[[one
pound would be enough to kill everyone on our
planet]{.underline}]{.mark}** if it were so evenly dispersed in the air
that everyone inhaled it.5

Although it occurs in nature in exploding stars, almost all plutonium on
Earth is man-made -- the product of manufacturing nuclear weapons and
energy in nuclear power plants. Of the different forms of nuclear
products, deadly Pu-239 is very abundant because it is used to make
nuclear weapons and is a by-product of energy production in nuclear
reactors. As part of the U.S. weapons program (between 1944 and 1988),
114 tons of Pu-239 was produced in nuclear reactors at the Hanford Works
facility, in Washington state, and at the Savannah River Site in South
Carolina.6 Large quantities of this Pu-239 remains at temporary storage
facilities at these locations. Hanford stores about 50 million gallons
of high-level radioactive nuclear and chemically hazardous wastes in
underground storage tanks that were not designed for long-term storage.
Roughly a third of these tanks have leaked, so that at least a million
gallons of radioactive waste has reached the natural environment.
Hanford is the most toxic site in the U.S., and among the most toxic
places on Earth. Over 1,000 contaminated sites at Hanford have been
identified. Groundwater aquifers are polluted for over 200 square miles
beyond Hanford.

No less than nine pounds of Pu-239 is used to make a working nuclear
bomb. As of 2015, a total of 15,695 nuclear weapons are stockpiled by
nine countries.7 Some of these weapons are 35 years old, but have a
shelf-life of only 25 years.8 These aging weapons are undergoing
corrosion. oxidation and other detrimental changes, and they must
constantly be maintained and upgraded to prevent them from becoming an
immanent threat to life on Earth. They are primary war targets. The
situation emphasizes the need for absolute global peace.

As of 2014, about 435 nuclear power plants have been built in 31
countries around the world.9 A great number of radioactive products,
including Pu-239, are byproducts of U-235 fission occurring in the fuel
rods of those plants with uranium reactors. In addition to being
susceptible to natural disasters and accidents, these nuclear plants are
all vulnerable to acts of war. They, too, emphasize the need for
absolute global peace.

Many nuclear power plants are operating beyond their established service
lives, and storing their nuclear wastes remains highly problematic. No
method for the long-term storage of high-level nuclear products was
available when industries began producing them to make commercial energy
and weapons. Storage remains very precarious, and there is no realistic
way to safeguard those that are long-lived. There are 93 different
long-lived radioactive elements that are toxic for a minimum of 17,000
years, and the time scale extends for many billions of years of total
decay time for some.10

The U.S. alone stores tens of thousands of tons of spent fuel containing
Pu-239 and other highly radioactive materials from the various reactor
cores. The quantity continues to increase worldwide as long as the
nuclear plants continue to operate. About 1% of spent nuclear fuel is
plutonium, and nuclear power provides about 10 percent of the world\'s
electricity. A uranium reactor will contain about a ton of plutonium.
These figures provide a rough idea of the enormity of continual global
radioactive waste accumulation. Aside from accidents like the Chernobyl
disaster (which contaminated 40% of Europe), dangers include the
potential for spontaneous fuel combustion and nuclear meltdown at pools
containing spent fuel. The following quote from a National Research
Council Panel report provides a rough idea of the growing tonnage
build-up of plutonium from commercial nuclear reactors:

"New production of commercial reactor plutonium during the first half of
the 1990s was about 70 MT \[metric tons\] per year."11

At least four to five tons of Pu-239 are known to have been released
into the environment during nuclear weapons testing.12 Much of the
Pu-239 remains buried underground at the test sites. But some was
released into the air during atmospheric tests, and some traveled for
many miles by way of groundwater after underground tests. [[About
two-thirds]{.underline}]{.mark} of the plutonium [in the atmosphere
[winds up in the oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}, where it tends to sink to
their bottoms and challenges sea life. [The polluted sediment is
disturbed and [redistributed by underwater tsunamis, earthquakes,
volcanoes and]{.mark} enormous [landslides]{.mark}]{.underline}.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):

"Residual plutonium from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing is
[[dispersed widely in the environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a result,
virtually everyone comes into contact with extremely small amounts of
plutonium."13

The EPA adds:

"People may inhale plutonium as a contaminant in dust. It can also be
ingested with food or water. Most people have extremely low ingestion
and inhalation of plutonium."

Given that humans retain plutonium, [[the longer we live the **more of
it our bodies can accumulate**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although exposure
can vary widely because of the way plutonium becomes distributed in the
environment, it is has already reached high enough levels
[[globally]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[cause serious
concern]{.underline}]{.mark}: According to a report from the Proceedings
of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop of the year 2000, titled
High-Sensitive Determinations of Pu and Am Content in Human Tissues:

"Now plutonium of both industrial and weapon origin is widely spread all
over the world and included in the soil cycle, water cycle and the food
chain, the end point of which is a human body\....Now we warn about the
serious hazard of dangerous accumulation of plutonium and americium in
human body, especially in liver and bones\....As it has been established
recently, plutonium in its tetravalent state (TV+) is accumulated in
human body during the whole life\..."14

3.2. Special Marine Environmental Risks Posed by Developing FNPPs

[FNPPs]{.underline}, similar to any other nuclear installation, may also
[pose risks to the environment]{.underline} \[19\]. Since the risks
faced by FNPPs are a combination of nuclear safety and maritime safety
risks, [constructing, operating, and deploying FNPPs may encounter
**more** safety and environmental issues than encountered by
**land-based** nuclear power plants, posing challenges to the marine
environment and marine ecosystem]{.underline}.

First, the [daily operation, maintenance, and refueling of
[FNPPs]{.mark} may [produce **spent fuel** and **radioactive
wastes**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[6,25\]. "Radioactive wastes are [**[not
biodegradable]{.mark}**, [no]{.mark}r is there any [possibility of
**removing** them]{.mark} from the sea]{.underline} once they have
entered it. [These [substances]{.mark}]{.underline} vary in their
effect, but in general, they [[are **absorbed** by]{.mark} marine
[organisms]{.mark}]{.underline}, often [[becoming
**concentrated**]{.mark} as they move up the food chain, and [affecting
the]{.mark} growth, reproduction, and [**mortality** of marine
life]{.mark}]{.underline}" \[41\]. Most of the environmental damage
caused by the nuclear industry comes from the refueling and disposal of
spent fuel and radioactive wastes \[42\]. For example, the incident at
[Chazhma Bay in August 1985]{.underline} involved refueling operations.
When [submarine K-431 was being refueled, an accident occurred that
caused the removal of reactor control rods]{.underline}. The accident
during refueling [destroyed much of the submarine]{.underline}, resulted
in crew member casualties, and [caused contamination to spread over a
significant area due to ejected fresh fuel]{.underline} \[19,43\].
Moreover, the [daily operation of FNPPs may affect the surrounding
marine environment due to potential **[low-level radiation]{.mark}
release** [and **heat dissipation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thermal
pollution from FNPPs may [[affect marine **flora, fauna, and
ecosystems**]{.mark} in nearby waters because [water temp]{.mark}erature
[change]{.mark} can [**fatally damage** marine life]{.mark}, change the
**[chemical composition]{.mark}** of seawaters, and [cause]{.mark}
ecological **[imbalance]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[16,22,44\].
[Additionally]{.underline}, even the deployment of FNPPs in the ocean
per se may have environmental impacts on the surrounding marine
geography and ecology; these [impacts include changing **sediment
deposition patterns** in nearby waters and the **unusual siltation** and
**erosion** of coasts, deltas, and beaches]{.underline}. FNPP accessory
devices also have similar problems. For example, [underwater power
cables could pose disturbances to the seabed, adversely affecting marine
flora, fauna, and ecosystems]{.underline} \[35,45\].

How to prevent FNPPs from becoming the Chernobyl at sea has become an
issue of concern to all countries and the whole international community.
[Once a **[nuclear incident]{.mark}** occurs at an FNPP, its radioactive
pollution to the marine environment [would **not be confined**
by]{.mark} national [borders, making radioactive]{.mark} marine
[pollution a **global problem**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Particularly when
FNPPs are deployed in disputed waters]{.underline} or in sea areas
beyond national jurisdictions, [[FNPPs]{.mark} may not only **[arouse
opposition]{.mark}** from other countries but also [cause **political
and diplomatic tensions**]{.mark} among states]{.underline} \[16,30\].
[FNPPs' [potential]{.mark} marine [environmental risks make]{.mark}
their [deployment]{.mark} quite **[sensitive]{.mark}** and may even
induce political and diplomatic tensions among states]{.underline}
\[16,30\]. The [interests of neighboring countries]{.underline} in the
region [can be affected by the deployment]{.underline} of FNPPs. For
example, countries with fisheries and tourism industries may see their
livelihoods impacted by potential environmental change or damage caused
by FNPPs. [[Countries that rely on shipping lanes]{.mark} may also be
[affected by potential **navigation hazards**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Additionally, countries with competing territorial claims may view the
FNPP deployment as a threat to their interests in the region. [Deploying
[FNPPs]{.mark}]{.underline} in waters with sovereign disputes may also
[[induce the problem of **overlapping jurisdiction**]{.mark} and
overlapping application of different state laws [in]{.mark} the
[regulation]{.mark} of FNPPs, [creating]{.mark} **regulatory [disputes
and chaos]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Because of these reasons, China's plan
of deploying twenty FNPPs in the South China Sea has aroused concerns
from its maritime neighbors, such as Vietnam and the Philippines. These
neighboring countries claimed that the deployment of FNPPs in disputed
waters would undermine their sovereignty and called for a collaborative
approach in which the potential effects on navigation safety and the
marine environment are evaluated and taken into account before any
deployment is approved \[30,51,52\].

### 2NC\-\--!\-\--!/D\-\--AT: No Accidents

Second, [when FNPPs encounter special circumstances (such as **extreme
weather**, **collisions**, external threats, operational errors, severe
machine damage, and fire/explosion)]{.underline} \[46\],
[[FNPPs']{.mark} environmental [risks]{.mark} may
**[heighten]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Once a severe accident occurs, for
example, colliding with ships navigating with high navigation speed,
colliding with rockets, or sinking in shallow water, there are risks of
leaking radioactive pollutants into the marine environment. [In the
event of accidents or other catastrophic events, "**nuclear damage could
be of an extreme magnitude**"]{.underline} \[6\]. [Leaked radioactive
materials from FNPPs could then **quickly disperse** into the ocean,
potentially contaminating **large areas of the sea** and causing
detrimental cross-border effects as well as **serious harm** to both
humans and marine ecosystems]{.underline} \[6,47\]. Moreover, maritime
security threats, such as terrorist attacks, armed intrusions, and the
hijacking of ships, may also endanger FNPPs and surrounding waters,
making physical protection against external threats vital for the
deployment of FNPPs \[48\]. In addition, without effective training for
crew members on board, [[human error-induced accidents are **more
likely** to occur on **FNPPs**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Research shows that
human errors are responsible for most ship accidents \[49\]. The
offshore working environment on FNPPs is more stressful for humans
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, compared with land-based nuclear
installations, often lacks enough human resources; consequently,
[[**operators of FNPPs** are **more prone** to making **errors**,
inducing nuclear accidents]{.underline}]{.mark} \[48\]. Research shows
that some radioactive leakage from nuclear-powered ships has resulted in
emergency dumping \[50\].

#### Even still, [all]{.underline} nuclear plants are prone to [accidents]{.underline} and [waste]{.underline}.

Small reactors also cause all of the usual problems: the risk of severe
accidents, the production of radioactive waste, and the potential for
nuclear weapons proliferation. By their very nature, reactors have
fundamental properties that render them hazardous. As a result,
[[**all** nuclear plants, including **SMRs**]{.mark}, can [undergo
**accidents** that could result in widespread radioactive
contamination]{.mark}.]{.underline} This possibility was on full display
in 2011 when three reactors at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant
melted down. The smallest of these, Fukushima Daiichi-1, had an output
of 460 megawatts, only slightly larger than the maximum output of 300
megawatts that characterizes a SMR. All else being equal, making
reactors smaller reduces the risk and impact of accidents. Smaller
reactors have a lower inventory of radioactive material and less energy
available for release during an accident. But [[even]{.mark} a [very
small reactor]{.mark} (say, one that generates under 10 megawatts of
electricity) can undergo [accidents]{.mark} that [result in
**significant radiation**]{.mark} doses to members of the **public**.
Further, [small modular reactor proposals]{.mark} often
[envision]{.mark} building [**multiple** reactors at a
site]{.mark}]{.underline}. The aim is to lower costs by taking advantage
of common infrastructure elements. The configuration offered by NuScale,
for example, has twelve reactor modules at each site, although it also
offers four- and six-unit versions. With multiple reactors, the combined
radioactive inventories might be comparable to that of a large reactor.
Multiple reactors at a site increase the risk that an accident at one
unit might either induce accidents at other reactors or make it harder
to take preventive actions at others. This is especially the case if the
underlying reason for the accident is a common one that affects all of
the reactors, such as an earthquake. In the case of the accidents at
Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant, explosions at one reactor damaged the
spent fuel pool in a co-located reactor. [[Radiation leaks from
one]{.mark} unit [made it difficult for emergency workers to
approach]{.mark} the [other units]{.mark}. The other undesirable result
of any SMR being constructed is increased production of radioactive
waste.]{.underline} The physical process underlying the operation of an
SMR, i.e., nuclear fission, will always result in radioactive substances
being produced. Thus, [radioactive [waste generation is **inextricably
linked** to]{.mark} the [production of **nuclear energy**, no matter
what kind of reactor is used]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite decades of
well-funded research, [[there is no]{.mark} demonstrated [way of]{.mark}
**safely** [managing these wastes]{.mark} because of a combination of
social and technical problems.]{.underline} Claims by SMR proponents
about not producing waste are not credible, especially if waste is
understood not as one kind of material but a number of different
streams. A recent paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences examined three specific SMR designs and calculates that
"relative to a gigawatt-scale PWR" these three will [[produce up to
**5.5 times** more spent fuel, **30 times** more long-lived]{.mark} low
and intermediate level [waste]{.mark}]{.underline}, and 35 times more
short-lived low and intermediate level waste. In other words, in
comparison with large light water reactors, SMRs produce more, not less,
waste per unit of electricity generated. As Paul Dorfman from the
University of Sussex commented, "compared with existing conventional
reactors, [[SMRs]{.mark} would [increase the **volume and complexity**
of the nuclear waste]{.mark} problem]{.underline}". Further, some of the
SMR designs involve the use of materials that are corrosive and/or
pyrophoric. Dealing with these forms is more complicated. For example,
the ARC-100 design will use sodium that cannot be disposed of in
geological repositories without extensive processing. Such processing
has never been carried out at scale. The difference in chemical
properties mean that the methods developed for dealing with waste from
CANDU reactors will not work as such for these wastes.

As Technospheric Breakdown
Accelerates, **[[Nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Power
Generation]{.underline} **[[Mishaps will Increase and
Intensify]{.underline}]{.mark}**

There is really no way around this
eventuality. [[As]{.underline} [all]{.underline} [the
nuclear]{.underline} [power plants]{.underline} [age, they
will]{.underline} [succumb
to]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[micro-stresses]{.underline}** [which]{.underline} [**inevitably **occur
in such]{.underline} **[an ever-deteriorating
environment.]{.underline}**]{.mark} [Most people
are** unaware**]{.underline} [of the true depth and breadth
of]{.underline} [technospheric]{.underline} [breakdown since it is a
concept]{.underline} **[rarely taken up by academia]{.underline}** [or
the media]{.underline}. The following excerpts provide a wider
perspective of [this unavoidable byproduct of the Industrial
Revolution.]{.underline}

[[Technospheric]{.underline} [breakdown is something that
occurs]{.underline} **[everywhere]{.underline}** [around the
globe,]{.underline} [**24/7**, without interruption, and with tremendous
repercussions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Let's start with [anything that has
been manufactured in the factories of the modern world or built on the
surface of the Earth.]{.underline} Simply put, everything [is in the
constant state of breaking down, degeneration,
deterioration.]{.underline}

What does this really mean when we say that every bridge is slowly
breaking down, every road is in greater disrepair with each passing day,
every reservoir is gradually degrading, every office building, every
factory, every school, every home, etc. most of which adhered to very
low building standards in the first place?

What does it mean when [[the infrastructure for
every]{.underline}]{.mark} sewer [[system]{.underline}]{.mark},
municipal water division, electrical grid, airport, railway station,
etc. [[is in a slow but sure process of degrading and
breaking]{.underline} [down.]{.underline} [So]{.underline}]{.mark},
unfortunately, [[is]{.underline} **[every nuclear power plant across the
planet]{.underline}**]{.mark}[.]{.underline} (Cosmic Convergence)

What makes this ongoing process of physical degradation so insidious is
that it almost always occurs subliminally. Through a gathering array of
various forces throughout post-modern civilization, there does exist a
sort of conspiracy of circumstances which has greatly magnified the
effects of technospheric breakdown. The completed marriage between the
industrial base of the Western powers and the financial class throughout
the world has guaranteed that this slow motion collapse will continue
unabated. How so?

Because so many corporate decisions are made according to their impact
on the bottom line, many inferior nuclear power plants have been
constructed around the globe. Likewise, because the mega-banks and
investment houses are now dictating to a financially-strapped Nuclear
Energy Industry, substandard nuclear reactors have been designed,
engineered and continue to be put into operation across the planet. One
only has to take a close look at the websites dedicated to
decommissioned nuclear reactors or cold shutdowns or partially closed
nuclear power plants or emergency actions taken at various nuclear power
generation sites to grasp just how precarious a position the entire
industry is currently in.

Unknown to even many of the nuclear engineers who address these issues
'in the office', or who fix the cascade of problems at nuke plants
themselves, is the notion of slow motion, subclinical,
pernicious technospheric breakdown. It often manifests in ways where
cause and effect cannot be easily established because of some of the
unseen forces produced by atomic fission. With that said, it should be
noted that a chapter could easily be dedicated to this particular issue
alone, so significant is it to the future of nuclear power generation

Then there is the problem of **[[nuclear
wastes]{.underline}]{.mark}** and natural rights, yes?

No one has articulated this point better than Albert Bates in his
definitive essay entitled The Karma of Kerma: Nuclear Wastes and Natural
Rights (Bates, A.K., 1988)

This extremely lucid and illuminating, sober and sane treatment
of [[the]{.underline} **[greatest ongoing environmental
disaster]{.underline}** [of our times]{.underline}]{.mark} lays bare the
most basic legal and human rights issues which [[converge around the
production,]{.underline} [treatment]{.underline} [and storage of nuclear
wastes.]{.underline}]{.mark} Were the governments of the world to read
and take to heart its simple and straightforward thesis, the current
incarnation of nuclear energy production would have been abandoned years
ago:

### 2NC\-\--!\-\--!/D\-\--AT: No Accidents\-\--SMRs

2\. SMRs are not generally safer or more secure than large light-water
reactors.

Because of their size, [you might think that **small** nuclear reactors
pose **lower risks** to public health and the environment than large
reactors]{.underline}. After all, the amount of radioactive material in
the core and available to be released in an accident is smaller. And
smaller reactors produce heat at lower rates than large reactors, which
could make them easier to cool during an accident, perhaps even by
passive means---that is, without the need for electrically powered
coolant pumps or operator actions.

However, [[the so-called]{.mark} passive [safety features that SMR
proponents]{.mark} like to [cite]{.mark} may [not always **work**,
especially during **extreme events**]{.mark}]{.underline} such as large
earthquakes, major flooding, or wildfires that can degrade the
environmental conditions under which they are designed to operate. [And
[in some cases]{.mark}, passive [features]{.mark} can actually [make
accidents **worse**]{.mark}]{.underline}: for example, the NRC's review
of the NuScale design revealed that [passive emergency systems could
[**deplete** cooling water of boron]{.mark}, which is [needed to keep
the reactor **safely shut down** after an accident]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In any event, regulators are loosening safety and security requirements
for SMRs in ways which could cancel out any safety benefits from passive
features. For example, [[the NRC]{.mark} has [approve]{.mark}d rules and
[procedures]{.mark} in recent years [that]{.mark} provide regulatory
pathways for **[exempt]{.mark}ing** new reactors, including
[SMRs]{.mark}, [from]{.mark} many of the **[protective
measures]{.mark}** that it requires for operating plants, such as a
physical containment structure, an offsite emergency evacuation plan,
and an exclusion zone that separates the plant from densely populated
areas]{.underline}. It is also considering further changes that could
allow SMRs to reduce the numbers of armed security personnel to protect
them from terrorist attacks and highly trained operators to run them.
[[Reducing **security**]{.mark} at SMRs [is particularly
worrisome]{.mark}, because even the safest [reactors]{.mark} could
effectively [become]{.mark} dangerous [**radiological weapons**
if]{.mark} they are **[sabotaged]{.mark}** by skilled
attackers]{.underline}. Even passive safety mechanisms could be
deliberately disabled.

Considering the cumulative impact of all these changes, [[SMRs could
be]{.mark} as---or even **[more]{.mark}**--- [dangerous than large
reactors]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, if a containment structure
at a large reactor reliably prevented 90% of the radioactive material
from being released from the core of the reactor during a meltdown, then
a reactor 5 times smaller without such a containment structure could
conceivably release more radioactive material into the environment, even
though the total amount of material in the core would be smaller. And
[if the SMR were located closer to **populated areas** with no offsite
emergency planning, more people could be **exposed to dangerously high
levels of radiation**]{.underline}.

Third, once the [meltdown of nuclear reactors occurs, it may cause more
serious maritime environmental disasters than land-based nuclear
installations do]{.underline}. If a core [[meltdown]{.underline}]{.mark}
were to occur [[at a **land-based** nuclear
installation]{.underline}]{.mark}, "[the radioactive core debris would
[melt into the **rock**]{.mark} below the plant, and the heat would melt
the rock [into an **insulating glaze around the
core**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The radioactivity would be [released
**slowly**]{.mark} into the environment, [which]{.mark} would [allow for
**measures to counteract** the radioactivity]{.mark}]{.underline}"
\[22\]. However, [if [a core meltdown]{.mark} were to occur [at an
**FNPP**]{.mark}]{.underline}, "[the radioactivity would be [released
**immediately** into the **hydrosphere** and]{.mark} would
**[disperse]{.mark} more [quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The [impacts
would be **larger and more stressful**]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly on those species and organisms which had a low tolerance to
radioactivity" \[22\]. Consequently, [in the case of a core meltdown,
[the overall **risks and consequences** of FNPPs]{.mark} would be
[**greater** than]{.mark} those of [land-based nuclear
plants]{.mark}]{.underline}, as environmental pollution [would become [a

[We live in]{.underline} [dangerous times]{.underline} [for many

weapons that can cause damage of unimaginable proportions
and]{.underline} [[power plants at which accidents can have severe,
essentially]{.underline} [unpredictable consequences for human
life]{.underline}]{.mark}. For all of its utility and promise, the
nuclear enterprise is unique in the enormity of the [vast quantities of
destructive energy that can be released through blast, heat, and
radioactivity.]{.underline} We addressed just this subject in a
conference in October 2011 at Stanford University\'s Hoover Institution.
The complete set of papers prepared for the conference is reproduced in
this book. The conference included experts on weapons, on power plants,
on regulatory experience, and on the development of public perceptions
and the ways in which these perceptions influence policy7. The
reassuring outcome of the conference was a general sense that the U.S.
nuclear enterprise currently meets very high standards in its commitment
to safety and security. That has not always been the case in all aspects
of the nuclear enterprise. And the unsettling outcome of the conference
was that it will not be the case globally unless governments,
international organizations, industry7, and media recognize and address
the nuclear challenges and mounting risks posed by a rapidly changing
world. The acceptance of the nuclear enterprise is now being challenged
by concerns about the questionable safety and security of programs
primarily in countries relatively new to the nuclear enterprise, and the
potential loss of control to terrorist or criminal gangs of fissile
material that exists in such abundance around the world. In a number of
countries, confidence in nuclear energy production was severely shaken
in the spring of 2011 by the Fukushima nuclear reactor plant disaster.
And in the military sphere, the doctrine of deterrence that remains
primarily dependent on nuclear weapons is seen in decline due to the
importance of non-state actors such as al Qaeda and terrorist affiliates
that seek destruction for destruction\'s sake. We have two nuclear
tigers by the tail. [[When]{.underline} [risks]{.underline} [and

than with]{.underline} [respect to the nucleus of]{.underline} [the

the shock of the devastation produced by two atomic bombs hitting
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Modern nuclear weapons are far more powerful
than those early bombs, which presented their own hazards. Early
research depended on a program of atmospheric testing of nuclear
weapons. In the early years following World War II, the impact and the
amount of radioactive fallout in the atmosphere generated by
above-ground nuclear explosions was notfully appreciated. During those
years, the United States and also the Soviet Union conducted several
hundred tests in the atmosphere that created fallout. The recent
Stanford conference focused on a regulatory weak point from that time
that exists in many places today, as the Fukushima disaster clearly
indicates. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was initially
assigned conflicting responsibilities: to create an arsenal of nuclear
weapons for the United States to confront a growing nuclear-armed Soviet
threat; and, at the same time, to ensure public safety from the effects
of radioactive fallout. The AEC was faced with the same conundrum with
regard to civilian nuclear power generation. It was charged with
promoting civilian nuclear power and simultaneously protecting the
public. Progress came in 1963 with the negotiation and signing of the
Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) banning all nuclear explosive testing in
the atmosphere (initially by the United States, the Soviet Union, and
the United Kingdom). With the successful safety7 record of the U.S.
nuclear weapons program, domestic anxiety about nuclear weapons receded
somewhat. Meanwhile, public attitudes toward nuclear weapons reflected
recognition of their key role in establishing a more stable nuclear
deterrent posture in the confrontation with the Soviet Union. The
positive record on safety of the nuclear weapons enterprise in the
United States---there have been accidents involving nuclear weapons, but
none that led to the release of nuclear energy---was the result of a
strong effort and continuing commitment to include safety as a primary
criterion in new weapons designs, as well as careful production,
handling, and deployment procedures. The key to the health of today\'s
nuclear weapons enterprise is confidence in the safety7 of its
operations and in the protection of special nuclear materials against
theft. One can imagine how different the situation would be today if
there had been a recognized theft of material sufficient for a bomb, or
if one of the two four-megaton bombs dropped from a disabled B-52
Strategic Air Command bomber overflying Goldsboro, North Carolina, in
1961 had detonated. In that event, just one switch in the arming
sequence of one of the bombs, by remaining in its \"off position\" while
the aircraft was disintegrating, was all that prevented a full-yield
nuclear explosion. A close call indeed! In the twenty-six years since
Chernobyl, the nuclear power industry has strengthened its safety
practices. Over the past decade, growing concerns about global warming
and energy independence have actually strengthened support for nuclear
energy in the United States and many nations around the world. Yet
despite these trends, the civil nuclear enterprise remains fragile.
Following Fukushima, opinion polls gave stark evidence of the public\'s
deep fears of the invisible force of nuclear radiation, shown by public
opposition to the construction of new nuclear power plants in close
proximity. It is not simply a matter of getting better information to
the public but of actually educating the public about the true nature of
nuclear radiation and its risks. Of course, the immediate task of the
nuclear power component of the enterprise is to strive for the best
possible safety record with one overriding objective: no more
Fukushimas. Another issue that must be resolved involves the continued
effectiveness of a policy of deterrence that remains primarily dependent
upon nuclear weapons, and the hazards these weapons pose due to the
spread of nuclear technology and material. There is growing apprehension
about the determination of terrorists to get their hands-on weapons or,
for that matter, on the special nuclear material---plutonium and highly
enriched uranium---that fuels them in the most challenging step toward
developing a weapon. The global effects of a regional war between
nuclear-armed adversaries such as India and Pakistan would also wield an
enormous impact, potentially involving [**[radioactive
fallout]{.underline}** [at **large distances** caused by a limited
number of nuclear **explosions**. This]{.underline} [is true as well for
nuclear **radiation** from a reactor explosion---fallout at large
distances would have a
**serious societal impact**]{.underline}]{.mark} [on the nuclear
enterprise]{.underline}. There is little understanding of the reality
and potential danger of consequences if such an event were to occur
halfway around the world. An effort should be made to prepare the public
by providing information on how to respond to such an event.

Small modular reactors (**[[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}**; i.e., nuclear
reactors that produce \<300 MWelec each) have [garnered attention

distinct SMR designs]{.underline} to an 1,100-MWelec pressurized water
reactor in terms of the energy-equivalent volume, (radio-)chemistry,

[attributed]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.underline} [the use of **neutron

[In its current form, the **Arctic Council** consists of the **eight
Arctic States**: **Canada**, the Kingdom of **Denmark** (including
Greenland and the Faroe Islands), **Finland**, **Iceland**, **Norway**,
the **Russian Federation**, **Sweden**, and the **United
States**.]{.underline} Each member state shares the collective
responsibilities of the Council, including the chairmanship duties that
rotate every two years. The eight Arctic States appoint a Senior Arctic
Official (SAO) to manage their interests in the Council. Representing
sovereign federal governments, SAOs guide and monitor the Council's
activities in accordance with the decisions and instructions of their
respective foreign office. Cooperation among the eight member states is
vital for the development and signing of ministerial declarations, which
enable and promote multilateral action in the Arctic.

Recognizing the core value of traditional knowledge systems, [[the
**institutional structure** of the Arctic Council integrates
**Indigenous peoples' organizations**]{.mark} **(IPOs)** [into
the]{.mark} intergovernmental [forum]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hossain and
Maruyama 2016). [Three IPOs representing Inuit (Inuit Circumpolar
Council), Saami (Saami Council), and Russian Indigenous peoples (Russian
Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North), held the status of
Permanent Participants (PP) in the AEPS, and retained their privileged
status when the AEPS evolved into the Arctic Council. The Aleut
International Association received PP status two years later in 1998,
followed by the Arctic Athabaskan Council and the Gwich'in Council
International in 2000. [As **Permanent Participants**]{.mark} in the
Arctic Council, [IPOs discuss]{.mark} ideas and **[policy
directives]{.mark}** with state representatives during ministerial
meetings [and facilitate community-based networking among]{.mark}
governmental [agencies]{.mark}, non-governmental organizations, and
Indigenous peoples' associations and communities. [Any **state**]{.mark}
or non-state actor [engaging in Arctic affairs **must consult
the**]{.mark} **six [IPOs before making decisions]{.mark}** [that affect
the Arctic and its inhabitants]{.mark}, including states and
organizations seeking observer status]{.underline} (Koivurova and
Heinämäki 2006; Koivurova 2010; Graczyk 2011). The creation of the
Arctic Council also provided an internationally recognized forum for
geographically disperse populations in the Arctic, advancing
communication and cooperation among separate Indigenous groups.

In addition to Member States and Permanent Participants, the Arctic
Council consists of Observers who represent non-Arctic states,
intergovernmental and interparliamentary organizations, and both
regional and global NGOs. Observer status in the AC enables state and
non-state representatives to attend ministerial meetings and stay
informed of policy directives. Observers participate in the Council with
the consent of member state delegations, and use their affiliation and
role to promote independent interests in Arctic politics (Manicom and
Lackenbauer 2013; Ikeshima 2016; Hossain and Maruyama 2016). States and
international institutions seek observer status in the Arctic Council to
contribute to the governance of environmental issues affecting global
climate change, and to gain a political stake in matters concerning the
potential economic development of the Arctic (Chater 2016). Although
Observers have a minimal role within the existing framework, their
presence and cooperation enhances the international legitimacy of the
Council.

First adopted in Iqaluit, Nunavut in 1998 and later revised at the
eighth Ministerial Meeting of the Arctic Council in Kiruna, Sweden in
2013, the Arctic Council Rules of Procedure govern the process for
admission into the Council for prospective observer states. As a
condition for receiving Observer status and the permission to attend the
ministerial meetings of the Arctic Council, the non-Arctic states have
agreed to respect the sovereignty of Arctic countries (Riddel-Dixon
2017, 39). This condition includes respecting the rights of the five
Arctic costal states as specified under the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which entered into force in November 1994.
Another of the seven criteria for admission as an observer state, Rule
6(d), stipulates that the state "respects the values, interests, culture
and traditions of Arctic indigenous peoples and other Arctic
inhabitants" (Arctic Council Rules of Procedure 2013, 14). Permanent
Participants represent independent legal and political organizations
under the collective direction of the Arctic Council, and Observers
recognize the sovereign rights of IPOs. [The current structure [provides
a **platform** for Indigenous peoples to express opinions and
**participate** in **decision-making processes**]{.mark} with member
states, [marking a **unique** and **important** function of the
Council]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Generating usable data across different knowledge systems is a primary
function of the Arctic Council. As international law scholar Timo
Koivurova (2012, 131) argues, [any adequate examination of the Council
requires "a clear understanding that the Arctic is simply an extension
of **existing** political, economic, and environmental systems." Current
international arrangements governing the Arctic cover issues specific to
particular interest groups and organizations]{.underline}, such as the
International Union for Circumpolar Health (IUCH) and the Convention for
the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic
(OSPAR). While open to participation from states, communities, NGOs,
business interests, and other stakeholders, issue-driven entities do not
have the capacity to develop or support compressive policies for Arctic
governance (Young 2005). [Within this context, the Arctic Council
emerged as a distinct and important forum for **regional cooperation**,
an intergovernmental body ideal for promoting and facilitating
governance in a drastically changing region of **global
significance**.]{.underline}

Clearly inconceivable is Arctic military cooperation during Russia's
continued aggression in Ukraine and threatening its Arctic neighbors.
But how can the complex suite of Arctic issues, such as climate change,
Indigenous concerns, marine safety, and environmental protection, be
addressed within this new geopolitical framework? [[The Arctic
Council]{.mark}, an intergovernmental forum established in 1996 and led
by the Arctic states, [has been the **leading forum**]{.mark} for
cooperation focusing on sustainable development and environmental
protection]{.underline}. The Council is not a science body but a user of
scientific knowledge to make policy decisions. The Council includes
Indigenous Peoples organizations (named the Permanent Participants), and
observers from non-Arctic states, and governmental and non-governmental
organizations. The Ottawa Declaration specifically prohibits the Council
from dealing with 'matters of military security' (fishing and marine
mammal issues have also not been addressed). Major Council assessments
have been conducted on climate change, shipping, oil and gas,
biodiversity, human development, and pollution. [[However, the Council's
work has been **paused** by seven of the Arctic states]{.mark} (less
Russia) [since the invasion of **Ukraine**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
February 2022. [[Since **by charter** the Arctic Ministers of the
**eight states must approve major new initiatives**, the current
**lack** of]{.mark} diplomatic [engagement with Russia **limits the way

risks the legitimacy of the Arctic Council by creating the perception
that its rulings are designed to advance Russian interests rather than
mutually-beneficial regional goals. The creation of the rotating
Chairmanship was an attempt to bolster the Council's legitimacy by
maintaining the perception of neutral and fair procedures, but this
facet of the Council fails to account for the conflict of interest
between Chairmanship duties and self-interest that might arise on the
part of the Chairmanship nation.

The future of the Arctic Council now hangs in the balance. The ongoing
Ukraine war has triggered renewed military posturing in the Arctic
Ocean, further souring relations between the Member States.27 In May
2022 Senior Arctic Officials (SAOs) continued to search for solutions to
the two month pause, a situation complicated by Russia holding the
Chairmanship. By June 2022 the Arctic seven announced that they would
"implement a limited resumption of \[their\] work in the Arctic Council
on projects that do not involve the participation of the Russian
Federation" and would "continue to examine additional modalities to
allow \[them\] to further continue the council's important work."28;
Meanwhile, academics likewise explored whether the remaining seven
Member States could establish a new Arctic organization to address
cooperation in the region without Russia.29 The American coordinator for
the Arctic region, James P. Deltart, of the US State Department rejected
that option stating,

[Creating an **alternative** structure to the Arctic Council is **not on
our agenda**. We believe [the Council holds the **greatest value** as a
circumpolar forum including **all**]{.mark} the [eight Arctic
states]{.mark} and binding together the people who live throughout the

On March 26--27, the sixth meeting of the International Arctic Forum
(IAF) convened by Russia will occur in Murmansk (IAF, accessed March
20). In advance of the IAF, [Russian President Vladimir [**Putin**
recently claimed that Russia is "**committed to cooperation** with all
interested]{.mark} partner [states]{.mark} and integration
associations"]{.underline} (President of Russia, March 17). The upcoming
IAF signifies [Moscow's goal [to be at the forefront of **Arctic affairs
and cooperation**]{.mark} and innovation in the region, while
[challenges]{.mark} remain [given Russia's **international
isolation**]{.mark} due to its full-scale invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. Thus far, [these challenges appear to be causing
[Moscow]{.mark} to **[struggle in attracting international
participation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for the IAF]{.underline}, instead
relying on domestic engagement and attendance. Moscow remains committed
to its goal of maintaining "Russia's leadership in the Arctic and
\[ensuring\] dynamic economic development of this macro-region \[by
consolidating\] all available tools, including financial and managerial"
(President of Russia, February 28). One of these tools is the IAF,
which, for the first time, will be held in Murmansk. The IAF has
previously taken place in Moscow (2010), Arkhangelsk (2011 and 2017),
Salekhard (2013), and St. Petersburg (2019). Of these cities, Salekhard
is the only one located in the Arctic. Murmansk is a notable location as
Russia's westernmost Arctic city near the border with Finland and Norway
and, according to Putin, "Russia's gateway to the Arctic" (President of
Russia, March 17). [Moscow's international relations, however, have
**seismically** changed since the last IAF in 2019 with Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. Finland and Sweden have
joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (NATO, April 4,
2023, March 7, 2024). Greenland has become a point of renewed security
interests for the United States (see Strategic Snapshot, February 10).
Meanwhile, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway, and Sweden have
all joined in support of Ukraine in Russia's ongoing war against the
country (Government of Canada; Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark;
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland; Government of Iceland;
Government of Norway; Government Offices of Sweden, accessed March 17).
[Another consequence of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine was the
[**rejection** by the seven other **Arctic states** of]{.mark}
cooperation with Russia in [the **Arctic Council**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in March 2022, which has since resumed limited project-level work (High
North News, April 27, 2022; Arctic Council, February 28, 2024).
Additionally, cooperation with Russia in the Barents Euro-Arctic Council
was suspended in March 2022, and, in 2023, Russia withdrew from the
Council (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, May 17, 2022, September
18, 2023). Moscow has also withdrawn from the International Council for
the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and it no longer cooperates with the
Nordic Council of Ministers (Nordic Council, March 3, 2022, February 25;
ICES, February 28). Additionally, the European Union, Iceland, and
Norway have suspended cooperation with Russia and Belarus in the
Northern Dimension joint policy (Koivurova, et. al., 2022; European
Union, March 8, 2022; ICES, February 28). Prior to these substantive
changes in Arctic cooperation, in 2019, the presidents of Finland and
Iceland, the prime ministers of Norway and Sweden, and the foreign
ministers of Denmark and Norway attended the IAF (IAF, accessed March
17). The website of the IAF claims that the largest delegations were
from the People's Republic of China (PRC), Norway, Finland, Sweden, the
United States, Denmark, Iceland, Canada, and Japan (IAF, accessed March
17). It was also attended by representatives from 12 international
companies along with 129 representatives of Russian companies. Putin has
attended all of the past IAF meetings, and it would therefore be unusual
if he is absent for this one. On March 17, he issued a welcome
statement, as he has done in the past, to the government officials,
scientists, and experts who will be in attendance (IAF, April 8, 2019;
President of Russia, March 17). Unlike in previous years, the attendees
have not been officially announced (President of Russia; IAF, April 1,
2019). The only international representatives in the program thus far
are from the PRC, Iran, and Japan. These are Ke Jin, General Director of
China Freight Forwarding Company, Hanieh Moghani, Vice-Chair of the
United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, and Sakiko Hataya
from Japan's Sasakawa Peace Foundation (IAF, March 17; UN Decade;
Sasakawa Peace Foundation, accessed March 18). Additionally, Lily Ong, a
geopolitics talk show host in Singapore, is noted as a "front row
participant" (IAF, March 17; Geopolitics360.net, accessed March 18).
Other speakers and attendees include Kremlin advisers and ministers,
Duma representatives, regional governors, and heads of Russian
corporations such as Rosatom (which is sponsoring the IAF), Novatek, the
Far East and Arctic Development Corporation, Norilsk Nickel mining
company, among others (IAF, March 17, \[1\], \[2\]). As in prior years,
the 2025 IAF features a cultural program to showcase "the uniqueness and
achievements of the Arctic regions, as well as Russia's leading role in
the development of the Arctic," according to Anton Kobyakov, advisor to
Putin and Executive Secretary of the IAF Organizing Committee
(Investment Platform of Russian Regions, March 10). The cultural program
includes a tour of the Soviet-era Lenin nuclear-powered icebreaker (the
first in the world, as well as the first nuclear-powered civilian
vessel) (IAF, accessed March 17). It also features a series of sporting
events, including the 51st Murmansk Ski Marathon, which attracted
participants from Germany, Slovakia, Australia, Georgia, Belarus, and
Kazakhstan in 2019 (IAF, accessed March 18). The isolating developments
discussed above have left Russia with a short list of potential Arctic
partners with whom it can cooperate despite the barrage of planned
activities. Currently, the PRC is the most attractive partner in terms
of its interests and availability to engage in the Arctic (see EDM,
February 18, March 6). The PRC has held observer status in the Arctic
Council since 2013 (Arctic Council, accessed March 17). Additionally, in
2018, the PRC declared itself a "Near-Arctic State," marking a new type
of identity in what it means for states to be Arctic (State Council of
the PRC, January 2018). The most notable agreements and new cooperation
initiatives resulting from the 2019 IAF were with the PRC (IAF, April
10, 2019). In April 2019, an agreement was signed between the Russian
Academy of Sciences and the Qingdao National Laboratory on the intended
establishment of the China-Russia Arctic Research Center (Ocean.ru,
April 10, 2019). A few days later, the PRC's National Oil and Gas
Exploration Development Company and Russia's Novatek signed a framework
agreement to develop the Arctic LNG 2 project (CNPC, April 26, 2019; see
EDM, May 20, 2019; Novatek, accessed March 17). Russian and PRC
representatives are, therefore, likely to announce further collaboration
agreements at this year's IAF. Potential further cooperation agreements
between Russia and possible attendees of this year's IAF may include
transportation and infrastructure partnerships with states such as
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Turkmenistan. This was highlighted in
February as a point of discussion for the IAF in relation to the
Northern Sea Route (NSR) during a meeting of these states and Russia at
the 3rd Caspian Economic Forum in Tehran (IAF, accessed March 17).
[Engagement **[excluding]{.mark}** other [Arctic states would mark a
**shift**]{.mark} for the IAF. Most agreements produced from the IAF
tend to be between domestic partners, but in the [past]{.mark}, the
[Forum has been a platform for **international dialogue and
cooperation** between Russia and **High North
neighbors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the 2019 IAF, Putin met with a
number of state leaders, including Patricia Espinosa, then-Executive
Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Erna
Solberg, then-Prime Minister of Norway, Stefan Löfven, then-Prime
Minister of Sweden, Sauli Niinistö, then-President of Finland, and Gudni
Thorlacius Johannesson, then-President of Iceland (President of Russia
April 9, \[1\], \[2\], \[3\], \[4\], \[10\], 2019). The 2019 IAF also
featured an Arctic fishing industry discussion with state
representatives and subject matter experts from Russia, Norway, Iceland,
Japan, and the United States (IAF, April 10, 2019). One month prior, an
EU agreement on preventing unregulated commercial fishing in the Arctic
had been signed by Canada, the PRC, Denmark, Iceland, Japan, South
Korea, Norway, Russia, and the United States, which entered into force
later that June (European Union, March 18, 2019; European Commission,
June 25, 2019). Also in 2019, the Arctic Society of Finland signed an
agreement with the Russian Geographical Society on scientific and
cultural collaboration (IAF, April 11, 2019). Given recent developments,
this year's IAF will likely feature heavy domestic attendance and much
lighter international participation than in years prior. At this point,
the upcoming IAF may as well be called the Domestic Arctic Forum.
Ultimately, the most revealing aspect of this year's IAF will be which
and how many international representatives choose to attend. As
narratives about past IAFs emphasize the number of participants and the
degree of international participation, it will be important to observe
any shifts that might occur in how the 2025 IAF is portrayed.

Trump's Arctic Turn and the Greenland Gambit

Trump's obsession with the Arctic is not new, but in his second term, it
has taken a more confrontational line. In a March 4 address to Congress,
he declared: "One way or another, we're going to get Greenland." Citing
national security concerns and economic potential, Trump framed
Greenland as an essential asset in securing U.S. dominance in the
Arctic. While he paid lip service to Greenlandic self-determination, his
rhetoric sparked an outcry from Greenland's leadership, who fiercely
rejected any suggestion of annexation.

The controversy over Greenland shows a broader shift in Trump's Arctic
strategy: the move away from cooperative multilateralism toward
unilateral strategic acquisition. This is to be seen in the context of
Trump's historical discomfort with NATO and his growing readiness to
sidestep European allies in favour of direct bilateral deals.
Greenland's rejection of Trump's comments has sparked debates about
sovereignty, resource nationalism, and the role of smaller Arctic actors
in shaping their destinies.

Arctic Cooperation on the Sidelines of War Diplomacy

[What began as negotiations on Ukraine in Riyadh between Russian and
U.S. [delegations]{.mark} also quietly [included discussion on **Arctic
energy and trade cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Kirill Dmitriev,
head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), confirmed that joint
[Arctic projects were **[explicitly]{.mark}** discussed]{.underline},

reportedly viewed this engagement as a chance to "drive a wedge" between
Russia and China.

At the same time, NATO-aligned [[Arctic
states]{.underline}]{.mark}---Canada, Norway, Denmark (through

**[geopolitical marginalization]{.mark}** and strategic
**uncertainty**]{.underline}. [Trump's]{.underline} previous disregard

**[alternative]{.mark}** Arctic [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The

[[challeng]{.mark}ing [Norway's **sovereignty**]{.mark} over

for strategic gains elsewhere, it could destabilize the northern

CONCLUSION: DEVELOPING AN ARCTIC COUNCIL STRATEGY

The danger of armed conflict among the Arctic States is very low. The
real danger confronting the Arctic is a rush for resources across
unsettled boundaries and Arctic States' reactionary responses, all of
which has the potential to break down long-standing norms within the law
of the sea and expose the sensitive region to further environmental
degradation already heightened by climate change. Yet, assertions by
environmentally-conscious states that they have interests beyond their
borders will lead to unpredictable outcomes where there are no rules to
accommodate their purported interests.

[[The Arctic States]{.mark} have signaled that they [wish to **remain**
the managers]{.mark} of this increasingly complex region [by]{.mark}
progressively **[formalizing the]{.mark} Arctic [Council's
structure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But [[to **retain** its
**leadership**]{.mark} role, [the Council and its members will have to
make **commitments to each other** and]{.mark} to [the **international
rules-based order**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In practice, the Arctic States
should treat the Council as a regional security system, recognizing that
their individual economic and military security is dependent on their
immediate neighbors' own security. In the event of environmental or
natural disasters, they will be more reliant on each other than on
external actors. [Clearly, [it is in the]{.mark} Arctic [States'
**interests**]{.mark}---**[individually and
collectively]{.mark}**---[for the]{.mark} Arctic [Council to remain
**indispensable** to Arctic **governance**]{.mark} and the sole
gatekeeper to the Arctic]{.underline}.

[[The Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} is gradually being recognised
as the main official policy forum for Arctic affairs by its member
states as well as non-Arctic actors. It [[is a]{.mark} high-level
[**decision-shaping forum** in which]{.mark} the [member states]{.mark},
called the Arctic states, the United States, Canada, Denmark, Sweden,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia [have executive rights to decide on
**regional recommendations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So far, no legal
treaty in Arctic politics is supported and the Council has only decided
on a couple of binding agreements. In addition to the member states, the
Council has permanent participants consisting of representatives from
six indigenous peoples' organisations, which have full consultation
rights in negotiations and meetings but have no voting rights. Moreover,
[the AC opens up for [permanent observers]{.mark} that [have **limited
possibilities** for **influenc**]{.mark}**ing** the
decision-making]{.underline}. To become accepted as a permanent
observer, the applicant, whether a state, a transnational or a
non-governmental organisation, is assessed against a set of criteria,
and needs to receive an unanimous approval from the Arctic states.
According to these criteria, the applicant shall recognise both the
Arctic states' sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the Arctic as well
as the legal framework that applies to the Arctic Ocean, mainly the
United Nations Convention on Law of the Seas (Arctic Council 2013).
Further, the actor needs to respect the rights of indigenous peoples and
have a political willingness and financial ability to contribute to
different Arctic projects.

The [permanent observers [can attend]{.mark} the Council's and the
working groups' [meetings]{.mark} and are expected to contribute
extensively to the projects of the working groups. [However, they
**don't** have]{.mark} the **[voting or consultation rights]{.mark}**
and thus **[cannot directly affect]{.mark} regional
[decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Regardless of these limitations
in the governance framework, many actors applied for the observer status
before the meeting in May 2013, indicating a growing attention to
current and future developments in the region.

The Arctic is an important region to watch over the coming years due to
polar ice caps melting and the potential for countries to claim more
land. While the problems that lie ahead are apparent, the solutions are
less obvious. It is possible that [[the Arctic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, even with its flaws, [[could]{.mark} be
the organization that can **[create peace]{.mark}** in the regions [by
**negotiating compromises** and **agreements**]{.mark} that satisfy all
of the **major parties**]{.underline}. In order [for this to happen, the
Arctic Council [needs to **prove**]{.mark} its strength [through
**demonstrating**]{.mark} that it is an impartial organization with
legitimate jurisdiction to govern the region through decreasing the
global perception of self-interested declarations, [and ensuring that
every interested nation is **included in the decision-making
process**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Moissev said one reason for the rise in tensions has been **Moscow's

[[Russia]{.mark}, feeling [**isolated** from the Arctic Council]{.mark}
since March 2022, [has]{.mark} actively [sought **new
partners**]{.mark}, specifically non-Western and non-Arctic partners,
with which it can work in the Arctic.]{.underline} Nikolay Korchunov,
the Russian Arctic Ambassador, has stated that Russia's

line in the Arctic Council will depend on the situation's further
development and respect for Russian interests. With the Council's
weakened role and effectiveness, provoked by our Western partners, we
are already engaged in active dialogue with an Arctic agenda in various
formats with other countries and organizations."44

During the remainder of Russia's Chairmanship, [when the remaining
[Arctic States **declined** to participate in projects involving Russia,
it continued]{.mark} to carry out a number of events in line with its
agenda [with]{.mark} what it called **["friendly countries"]{.mark}** -
**China**, **Brazil**, **Mongolia**, **Belarus** and
**Kazakhstan**.]{.underline}45 [[This]{.mark} growing [division into
camps is]{.mark} clearly [disconcerting and]{.mark}, should it continue,
will prove **[counterproductive]{.mark}** as Arctic and non-Arctic
States strive to address Northern issues.]{.underline}

Russia's Arctic Ambassador has clarified that Russia has no intention of
creating an alternate forum to the Arctic Council, but his comments
similarly suggest that it will remain in the Council only as long as it
serves Russia's interests and respects its right to participate in
Arctic Council meetings and work.46 Still, [Russia has lamented that the
collapse in relations has resulted in **little activity** by the Arctic
Council's Working Group on Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna during
a time in which growing economic activity in the North along with
climate change are resulting in increased pressure on Arctic species and
ecosystems.]{.underline}47 [This concern could serve as a jumping off
point for **rebuilding relations** between the Arctic States in
particular]{.underline}. In September 2023, the Arctic States approved
new guidelines so that its Working Groups could return to existing
projects and propose new projects.48 Morten Høglund, Norway's Arctic
ambassador and the Chair of the Senior Arctic Officials under the
Norwegian Chairship, believes that returning to the levels of
collaboration prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine will necessitate
"a lot of time", Norway aims to "resume large parts of \[Arctic
Council\] work in several important fields, such as climate, and start
new projects."49

The question remains to what extent the Arctic seven are open to trust
Russia at this time. Kal Kornhuber et al. argue that, "\[r\]esuming key
elements of critically needed scientific and political cooperation is
dependent on the end of Russian aggression against Ukraine."50; Indeed,
the Russian State's readiness to violate international law and escalate
conflicts, signals that disagreements with Russia "must now be viewed in

cooperation between all Arctic countries is important" and "\[t\]he best
answer to possible challenges with such cooperation is that we hold on
to the Arctic Council as the most important forum for Arctic issues."52;
With military activity steadily rising in the north53 and alliances
crumbling, a situation reminiscent of the Cold War, soft power outlets
are needed more than ever. While the Russian invasion of Ukraine has
broken trust, an Arctic Council without participation of Russia would be
severely impaired; the global community would likely have real doubts
about its legitimacy. Rebuilding that trust is critical as the Arctic
experiences rising ecological, economic and geopolitical stressors
associated with accelerated warming; principally focusing on common
environmental challenges, through the resumption of scientific
collaboration with Russia, could serve as that first key goodwill step.

4\. Navigating an ice-free Arctic: waves of discontent

As the Arctic Council grapples with its uncertain future, it similarly
must contend with an alarming rate of sea-ice loss and the new
geopolitical challenges and economic opportunities this transformation
brings forth. When the Arctic Council released the first comprehensive,
multidisciplinary assessment of the impacts of climate change on the
Arctic, the global community became acutely aware of the challenges it
faces. The 2005 Arctic Climate Impact Assessment54 detailed the stunning
transformation taking place in the north, as warming temperatures
profoundly alter the region's terrestrial landscape and marine
environment through rapid melting of sea-ice and permafrost, which
threatens the region's ecological integrity and biodiversity. The
Arctic, once considered a "frozen desert"55; accessible only with
specialized marine vessels, is undergoing a radical physical alteration,
reshaping shorelines,56 and opening newly accessible waterways. This
change will have far reaching implications for its ecological integrity,
as well as its future place on the global economic and political stage.
Year after year, Arctic ice cover reaches new record lows.57 The Arctic
Ocean is now 40 percent ice-free at its lowest ice cover in September.58
Despite international efforts to keep global temperatures below a 1.5℃
increase, models predict a 2°C rise in the Arctic by 2040, which would
result in an ice-free passage for cargo and supply ships in the Beaufort
Sea and parts of the Northwest Passage for over half of the year.59 With
a predicted 4°C increase by 2100, ice would no longer cover the Arctic
Ocean for two thirds of the year; private vessels and cruise ships, not
equipped with ice-breaking equipment, could sail freely through the
Arctic Ocean.60 As the once frozen Arctic Ocean transforms "in a single
generation into a newly accessible ocean,"61; Arctic scholarship speaks
increasingly of a "new" Arctic, a term encompassing both environmental
and economic change.

The Arctic no longer lies on the periphery of economic and political
discourse. The potential for significant economic gains, particularly in
oil and gas exploitation, minerals, fishing and shipping, has attracted
non-Arctic States' attention. These States question the logic of a
regional forum since climate change, and its role in the unprecedented
transformation of the Arctic environment, are global concerns that
require an international response, especially as socioeconomic and
geopolitical ties between the Arctic and the rest of the world draw
tighter. China has proven particularly vocal regarding its discontent
with the Arctic's historically regional governance structure.

In its 2018 White Paper on Arctic Policy, China made clear that it no
longer wants to take a back seat in Arctic governance.62 At a distance
of almost 1500 km from the Arctic Circle, China identifies itself as a
"Near-Arctic State".63 In its White Paper, intended to clarify China's
Arctic Strategy, it is careful not to make any territorial claims on the
Arctic,64 which could threaten its Arctic Council Observer status; the
"Near-Arctic" identity differentiates China from the Arctic States, but
still puts it in a position of advantage relative to other states.65 The
White Paper left many questions regarding China's intentions, which did
nothing to quell concerns that non-Arctic States may undermine the
status quo in the Arctic. Canada, Russia and the United States, in
particular, have distrusted China's Arctic ambitions, even challenging
China's application for Observer status.66 More recently, the United
States and Canada have expressed fears over the "dual purpose" of
China's research in the Arctic Ocean, especially the presence of
submarines.67

China recognized early that scientific research offers a legitimate
means by which to engage in Arctic governance.68 With its growing fleet
of Arctic capable ships and science station on Svalbard, China has
engaged in extensive research, which it highlighted in its bid to gain
Observer status. Now, however, [[China sees the Arctic Council]{.mark}'s
focus on environmental protection and knowledge sharing [as
**limiting**]{.mark}. It believes the Council should address key
economic and political issues of an ice-free Arctic, [but its Observer
status does not permit China to influence the]{.mark} Council's remit or

relations strained between the Member States and among Observers,
steering clear of economic and geopolitical issues and heavily
reinvesting in cooperative missions that include China could prevent the
fracturing of the Council into separate camps with limited
cross-dialogue.

of Russia's Arctic policy, removing mentions of the Arctic Council while
prioritizing national Arctic interests, coupled with Finland's recent
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Sweden's
pending application, serve as an indication of the diminishing prospects
for the future of pan-Arctic cooperation.27 Debates about the future of
the Arctic Council have been prominent across media outlets, discussions
at Arctic conferences, and academic discussions, showing fluctuating
optimism and pessimism regarding the future of the AC.28

3 The history of Russian climate science

3.1 Russian approaches to international climate science

Considering the historical context of Russian, and formerly Soviet
climate science provides context for its current contributions to the
Arctic Council, and the underlying conditions that underpin their
creation, use, and implementation. When the development of climate
science is discussed, contributions from Soviet science from the
post-war period until the dissolution of the Soviet Union tend to be
overlooked.29 Soviet science was in the lead internationally in
developing models of atmospheric circulation systems and in the fields
of radiation, heat balance, and general climatology.30 During the Cold
War, Soviet scientists did not have access to the high-speed computers
and infrastructure necessary to develop models to forecast long-term
climatic changes.31 Instead, climatologists often used paleoclimatic
models, leaning on theories of cyclical climatic changes and history
repeating itself, making the paleoclimatic approach one of the dominant
traits of Soviet, and later Russian science.32 During the early stages
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Soviet work on
forecasting climate change was presented internationally primarily by a
small group of scientists. These Soviet scientists, and later Russian
research traditions were in opposition to the IPCC's focus on the
irreversible man-made impact on Earth's climate.33

During the 1990s, the countries in the former Soviet Union faced
significant economic challenges, making all scientific work less of a
priority. Many young researchers and parts of the scientific elite left
Russian academia, whereas older and established scientists usually
stayed in their positions, and skepticism toward man-made climate change
prevailed.34 However, in Russia scientific attitudes towards climate
change shifted towards anthropogenic explanations in the early 2000s,
which coincided with Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in
2004, although this was not necessarily the cause of the shift.35
Despite the Russian Academy of Sciences' assertion that the Kyoto
protocol had no scientific basis,36 discourse on the causes of climate
change began to place a stronger emphasis on the role of greenhouse gas
emissions.37 While anthropogenic explanations of climate change became
increasingly prominent in Russian climate science during the 2000s,
debates still persisted regarding the extent to which climate change
could be associated exclusively with negative outcomes.38

3.2 Russian approaches to climate change

Despite Russia now being in line with international climate science,
Russian approaches to climate change still differ from approaches in the
West, both in terms of science, policy and negotiations of international
agreements, with Russia highlighting the potential benefits resulting
from global warming to a greater degree.39 Discourses on climate risks
are frequently accompanied by talk of new opportunities, especially in
the Arctic region.40 This is reflected in processes leading up to
Russian ratification and implementation of various international
environmental agreements, and within domestic policy.41 Domestically the
effects are seen through an extensive focus on climate adaptation in
favor of mitigation, in contrast to western approaches which to a higher
degree favor mitigation through a reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions.42 In addition, implementation processes of environmental
agreements are frequently affected by priorities related to foreign
policy, national image, or economic benefits.43

While the domestic discourse on climate change in Russia cooled after
ratification of the Kyoto Protocol,44 the ratification itself has been
viewed as a political decision, motivated more by image-building than
environmental concerns.45 Some scholars have suggested that Russia's
initial motivation for joining the Protocol was to gain admission to the
World Trade Organization and that the decision to decline participation
in its second phase was influenced by this relationship.46 Despite the
opposing views of Russian, and formerly Soviet and Western research
traditions, there were ongoing collaborations in the fields of
environmental protection and conservation before the Kyoto Protocol as
well. The USSR and the USA signed a bilateral agreement on environmental
protection in 1972 that incentivized the exchange of expertise on
several environmental issues, including pollution, nature conservation,
and prevention of environmental emergencies.47 Additionally, the USSR
together with the USA, Norway, Canada, and Denmark signed a multilateral
agreement on the conservation of polar bears in 1973,48 the first time
the five Arctic nations collaborated in a conservation measure through a
treaty.49

3.3 Russian participation in the Arctic Council

The two most prominent controversies related to Russian participation in
the AC include the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the
North (RAIPON) dispute in 2008 and the Russian annexation of Crimea in
2014.

The Russian Arctic strategic goals announced in 2008 included
recognition of several risks faced by Indigenous peoples in the Russian
Arctic and the need to combat these risks.50 Despite this formal
prioritization, RAIPON questioned the Russian government's sincerity as,
in practice, it was continuously violating Indigenous rights in the
Arctic.51 This led to the Russian government suspending RAIPON in 2012
and demanding changes in RAIPON leadership in order for the organization
to be allowed to continue its work.52 This conflict created tensions
between the Russian delegation and other members of the AC.53

In March 2014, two years after the RAIPON dispute, the Russian
annexation of Crimea affected diplomatic relations within the Council.54
Practical consequences in the AC consisted of Canada and the USA
boycotting several meetings in the working groups and Russian Foreign
Minister Sergey Lavrov not attending the ministerial meeting in Iqaluit,
Canada, in 2015.55 Despite increased tensions in Russian--Western
relations, work within the AC continued, and Russia increased its
sponsorship of several AC projects.56

Cooperation in the Council was challenged again when Russia invaded
Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The full-scale military invasion affected
scientific collaborations worldwide.57 In March 2022, the seven
non-Russian AC members declared a pause in their work in the Council.58
Russia, then chairing the AC, could only carry out its plans at a
national level, which they proceeded to do.59 With all institutional
research collaborations on hold and few windows open for
researcher-to-researcher dialogue, the AC is facing its most significant
challenge to date.

4 Three dimensions of Arctic climate science

[The consequences of the current geopolitical climate on the practices
of the AC play out across three dimensions: in the maintenance of
**researcher networks**, the **translation of knowledge**, and the
**scientific independence** of the Council's working
groups]{.underline}. These dimensions cannot be neatly separated, as
they constitute the premises for each other. [The scientific
independence of the working groups in the AC enables cooperation through
active **researcher networks**, which in turn facilitate for continuous
**translation of knowledge between science and policy**]{.underline}.
Hence, the dimensions are presented through their intertwined
co-production.

[Firstly, within the dimension of knowledge translation, the
[scientists]{.mark} in this study explain part of their [work]{.mark} as
[mediating between scientific knowledge production and **political
action**]{.mark}. They [translate their findings by]{.mark} presenting
them at conferences, **[talking to policy actors]{.mark}**, and
**motivating them** to act. Their perceived role in the interface
between science and policy is **active**, with works of translation
forming the **core** of their practices]{.underline}. During an
interview with a Russian scientist, he explained the importance of
outreach to critical actors for engagement in his research area:

Close relationships with people and with their surroundings, which means
it is also essential to meet people in person, right? Conferences or
events where first faces \[leading politicians\] participate, or other
people with influence, who need you to carry information to them, you
must show your position to them, and explain ... to motivate them.
(Russian Scientist 2, 2022)60

By explaining the importance of dialogue with decision-makers, Russian
Scientist 2 illustrates how his role goes beyond scientific work to
active engagement with policy. In this quote, an active role of
translation and broadcasting of scientific knowledge becomes a condition
forming his practice. However, regardless of enrollment and the
spreading of interest, active researcher engagement does not guarantee
the implementation of produced scientific knowledge.

How the implementation takes place for me is another mystery. It's like
a black box. Because it's hard to say. If I've held a conference and
I've been listened to for a few hours, someone's heard something I've
said, where does all this go? I do not know. How is this implemented? I
do not know. What I do know, however, is in the form of feedback. When
someone asks me, "Hello, please, show me, tell me, why does Arkhangelsk
hang after Murmansk?" I understand that it is an interest. If there is a
governor who asks me about this here, then I understand that this means
that we are on the right track. (Russian Scientist 1, 2022)

Russian Scientist 1 compares his experiences with the perceived
implementation and use of his research to a black box. The role of
feedback is emphasized, both as a mechanism to show that his work is
being received by policymakers and as a personal motivating factor. As
there are no mechanisms or guarantees for being heard, any
acknowledgment of research becomes an unexpected win.

And I can say that when politicians start talking about this, without
even referring to me, but they use my terms and the phrases I used three
or four years ago, it doesn't upset me. Instead, I'm overjoyed because
it means that the knowledge has reached them. It means they have read
what I have written; it means they have heard it! (Russian Scientist 1,
2022)

Another essential element of perceived contributions to the use of
climate knowledge is the perception of being heard by Russian
policymakers. Russian Scientist 1, in this case, highlights how he has
experienced his terms and phrases as being received by politicians,
indicating occasional active bonds between science and policy in Russian
Arctic climate science. During this interview, he explained the
importance of their scientific work being in line with the sustainable
development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, as this contributes to
credibility and standardization.

In our work, we developed several indexes on sustainable development. We
wanted to do something exciting; we wanted to see where we were
positioned in relation to the SDGs. And we were relieved when our
indicators practically matched all of these! \[Laughs.\] Of course,
there is never an absolute similarity, but the differences in rating
mainly depended on the inclusion of more variables. When we found this
out, we breathed a sigh of relief and knew that what we use does not
differ much from the data used by the World Bank or the ministries of
the UN. (Russian Scientist 1, 2022)

Historically, Russian climate science has differed from the perspectives
of the IPCC and Western climate science. A wish for international
consensus and alignment with the SDGs reflects the discursive shift of
Russian climate science toward an international consensus.

[[Translation]{.mark} between science and policy [is]{.mark} also
[prominent in the **Council**]{.mark}, as [reports created by]{.mark}
its [working groups]{.mark} must [make their way to
**policymakers**]{.mark}. [For policymakers to understand the
value]{.mark} of research results developed in the AC working groups,
[it is essential to **translate**]{.mark} scientific results into the
language of policymakers]{.underline}.

It's like trying to put a fish in the ocean, wishing for it to be caught
by the right person at the right time. Of course, it's a gamble. You
think you published your best work, and it may not even be discovered.
There's a sea of articles out there, and management, neither at the
bureaucratic nor the ministerial level, can understand them completely.
You need someone who pulls things together and does things. Our
scientific reports are heavy; they are not easy for politicians to
understand, but we try to create summaries in twenty pages or so, and
then we have a list with policy recommendations, which are negotiated
and make it easier for us to get things through. We get a lot of praise
for telling the root of what's important, why it is important, and why
this will make a difference. So, it makes it much easier to release the
fish into the sea. (AC Member 2, 2022)

The translation between science and policy in the Council is key for
making use of the produced knowledge in the AC working groups. Russian
Scientist 1 described how knowledge is translated to policymakers
through dialogue, and AC Member 2 explained how the AC, in addition to
publishing heavy scientific reports, includes policy recommendations and
summaries. The translation of Arctic science to the field of
policymakers does not go unnoticed. AC Member 1 recounted how the Arctic
Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) report in 2005 made a noticeable
impression on a Bangladeshi minister at an IPCC meeting.

We made the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment in 2004 and 2005, which is
a bible, and many Russian scientists were involved in this as well. We
traveled to Buenos Aires to an IPCC meeting and discussed our findings.
The first person to take the floor after us was the minister of
Bangladesh, and he had tears in his eyes, saying that "this is the most
tragic day in my life, for you are telling us that several millions of
my people will be flooded and must leave their homes," and that was
right. When the Arctic melts, Bangladesh will be severely affected. (AC
Member 1, 2022)

The ACIA report is one of many examples of how the knowledge produced by
the Council has achieved political traction. The AC has contributed to
several environmental conventions affecting national and international
environmental policy. During the interviews with AC members 1 and 2,
they explained the success stories of the Stockholm Convention and the
Minamata Convention, which are examples of how Arctic scientific
knowledge directly impacts political action.61 The idea of scientists as
translators, suppliers, and brokers of knowledge was also prominent in
the Minamata Convention, as the AMAP working group took an active part
in the processes leading up to international negotiations on the
convention.62

The second dimension of scientific cooperation in the Council is the
importance of researcher networks.63 The maintenance of researcher
networks in the AC gives individual scientists a sense of belonging to
the work and fields of their colleagues. As the AC is an arena that
intertwines knowledge creation and decision-making, the translations
that happen internally in the working groups rely on translations
between science and policy, and vice versa.

Thirdly, the lack of binding obligations is partly responsible for
giving the Council its political legitimacy and the opportunity to lift
necessary knowledge to the level of international conventions. [The
non-binding principle of [the Council protects **scientific
integrity**]{.mark} through its partial separation from obligations in
policy fields, and the [working groups]{.mark} gain the [free]{.mark}dom
[to provide **precise policy recommendations**]{.mark}]{.underline}:

I think the Arctic Council is very important in the sense that it has
not been politicized, that it does not come with many binding agreements
because they would have been diluted, right? It would be thin soup.
\[...\] The recommendations of the working groups that are at a lower
political level can be quite precise, right? Then you can do something
because it is at a management level. (Expert Interview 1, 2022)

The most important thing for us is the principle of scientific
integrity. We emphasize that our reports are scientific and represent
the view of the experts and not the Arctic Council nor the views of the
working groups as such. It's important to act as a legitimate,
scientific body. (AC Member 2, 2022)

In these interviews, two levels of importance are presented for the
scientific legitimacy of the AC: the principle of scientific integrity,
and the ability to provide non-diluted recommendations. Even though
knowledge production in the AC working groups is incentivized by a level
of disconnect between science and policy, the fields of science and
policy are not entirely separated. This intertwining is visible in the
relationship between the Council's three levels, as consensus is
required for decisions to be made, and the mandate in the working groups
is received from senior Arctic officials and ministerial meetings.64
However, by emphasizing the separation of the scientific reports from
the official views of the Council, AC Member 2 illustrates room for
legitimacy through depoliticization.

Analysis of the interviews reveals that the co-production of scientific
knowledge in the Council operates across three dimensions, namely:
researcher networks, translation of scientific knowledge between science
and policy, and scientific integrity. All aspects of the co-production
and outreach of Arctic climate science affect each other, as active
researcher networks enable possibilities for knowledge translation to
the field of policy, and depoliticized scientific integrity contributes
to the legitimacy of the translated knowledge and creates room for
cooperation through international researcher networks in the AC.

5 How the Russian war against Ukraine has changed conditions in Arctic
science

5.1 The weakening of dimensions in the Arctic Council

During an interview in late spring 2022, a Russian scientist expressed
concern for the future of Arctic climate science.

We are in total isolation; we are sanctioned everywhere. Who will care
about the climate? Of course, there are \[Russian\] institutes that work
on climate, but their work has become almost insignificant. There are
some people that say that if we don't act now, we have a scary future
ahead of us when it comes to climate change, but we are already living
in a frightening future, and not because of the climate. The current
prospects are alarming, and climate has nothing to do with the matter.
And based on that, convincing someone to work with climate ... I have
worked with Arctic climate all my life; I now feel that it is entirely
useless for me to talk to anyone because I become a person from a
completely different planet. (Russian Scientist 4, 2022)

There are two main arguments embedded in this quotation. First, Russian
Scientist 4 explains how he finds himself in a bind between translating
his knowledge of climatic changes in the Arctic and understanding the
risks of the current political situation. Understandably, the current
political priorities and discourses that have followed the Ukraine
crisis concern short-term military risks. For some, the long-term
effects of climate change, no matter their danger, pale in comparison to
the impacts of the war. Second, he emphasizes how Russian climate
science is currently in total isolation. Both the dimensions of the
translation of scientific knowledge and the value of networks appear
fragile and at risk of weakening. Russian Scientists 1 and 2 mention how
the translation of knowledge and communication around scientific results
are of key value in the development and growth of their research,
leading to a question of how Arctic science can be heard and used if it
cannot be translated or communicated.

[Just as Russian scientists encounter difficulties translating their
knowledge inside Russia, [the Council faces]{.mark} similar [challenges
due to the **freeze in cooperation** with]{.mark} their [Russian
colleagues]{.mark}. The consequences of the pause play out at material
and social levels. [**Researcher networks** are]{.mark} only one of the
things [lost]{.mark} in this lack of translation, as [challenges]{.mark}
mount [in]{.mark} the **[gathering]{.mark} of [data]{.mark}** [on
thawing **permafrost**, **biodiversity**, and **environmental
monitoring**]{.mark}]{.underline} from Russian territory. **[[Russian
data plays a crucial role in Arctic climate
research]{.underline}]{.mark}**.65,66 [[Suspensions of scientific
collaboration]{.mark} and lack of access to data after the Russian
invasion of Ukraine [are **worrying scientific
communities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and calls to resume cooperation can
be heard.67

1\. The Executive Function: The Arctic Council Should Enforce Joint
Environmental Protections

[The [Arctic Council's **working groups** have]{.mark} already
[developed a number of policy **proposals**]{.mark}]{.underline} that
could be implemented. For instance, the Protection of the Arctic Marine
Environment (PAME) has proposed establishing a network of "Marine
Protected Areas" (MPAs), specially managed ecological areas identified
for conservation measures under national laws.182 The proposal provides
an overarching framework to link nationally managed MPAs within the
separate EEZs of Arctic States to coastal and inland habitats, with the
goal of harmonizing conservation and preserving biodiversity in the
region.183 [[The]{.mark} Arctic [Council could turn]{.mark} PAME's
[**framework proposal** into a **binding
agreement**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as one author has suggested.184

Indeed, much or all of PAME's proposals---and the [proposals of the

[a **one-time agreement**]{.mark} to [strengthen]{.mark} the [working

In the second period, [from the end of [2015 through]{.mark} until the
end of [2018, there is]{.mark} overall [a **low level of US
legitimation** of the]{.mark} Arctic [Council]{.mark}]{.underline},
except for a moderate peak during the second quarter of 2017. In this
quarter, the Arctic Council ministerial meeting was held in Fairbanks,
Alaska, making the US the host nation, and the then Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson provided some statements in support of the organisation
and its part in multilateral cooperation to tackle climate change.109

Apart from this peak, it is surprising that there is so little
legitimation during this four-year period. The US was the Arctic
Council's chair and might have been expected to convey more support.
[[The **slump**]{.mark} in legitimation statements [is]{.mark} likely
[connected to the **Trump administration**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike
the previous administration, [under Trump the US took a more
[**sceptical** attitude]{.mark} to climate change and international
environmental cooperation. This negative development in global
environmental politics may have led to less legitimation]{.underline}.
However, this decline in US legitimation is noticeably not accompanied
by an increase in delegitimation, apart from the spike in the second
quarter of 2019. This suggests that although the US was less inclined to
voice support for the Arctic Council during the early years of the Trump
presidency, it was also not proactively attacking the organisation at
this point. In fact, in the second quarter of 2019 when Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo attended the Arctic Council ministerial meeting in
Finland, there is another peak in US legitimation. In the later stages
of the Trump presidency, the US resumed support for some aspects of the
Arctic Council (albeit coupled with challenges). The following
statements are examples of US legitimation at this time, showing how it
foregrounds specific aspects of the Arctic Council, particularly
cooperation only between the Arctic states:

As you know, the United States has been a strong supporter of the Arctic
Council, which is composed of all eight nations that have territories
above the Arctic Circle. And it is the premier international forum for
building consensus to support peace and cooperation in the Arctic
region. (2 May 2019, Senior State Department Official's previewing the
Secretary of State's upcoming trip to Rovaniemi, Finland)110

Together, with the seven other Arctic States, the United States builds
cooperation at the Arctic Council based on shared values. (6 May 2019,
Secretary Pompeo travels to Finland to attend the Arctic Council
ministerial meeting)111

However, as discussed below, these legitimation statements during 2019
were accompanied by a large increase in US delegitimation.

US delegitimation of the Arctic Council

Overall, the US produces less delegitimation about the Arctic Council
than China, which might be expected given that it is a core member of
the organisation (Figure 1). However, towards the end of the 12 years
analysed, the US starts to produce more delegitimation. This supports
arguments that even [long-standing members and important participants in
the ILO's institutions still **challenge** its legitimacy]{.underline}.
[[There is a **large increase in US delegitimation** during]{.mark} the
second quarter of [2019]{.mark}]{.underline}. The following are examples
of the delegitimation statements it made at this time:

There are Arctic states and there are non-Arctic states. The eight
Arctic states conduct governance of the Arctic region, and we reject
attempts by non-Arctic states to claim a role in this process. (2 May
2019, Senior State Department officials previewing the Secretary of
State's upcoming trip to Rovaniemi, Finland)112

Russia, an Arctic Council member, has fruitfully cooperated with the
Council in a number of areas, including education, oil spill response,
search and rescue cooperation, and pollution issues. However, Russia's
unlawful regulation of foreign vessels transiting off its coasts and the
government's threats to use military force concern the United States
Government, as well as other Council members. (6 May 2019, Secretary
Pompeo travels to Finland to attend the Arctic Council ministerial
meeting)113

[[These delegitimation statements evaluate the]{.mark} Arctic [Council
based on a criterion of **'inclusion'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (shown to
be frequently important in legitimacy evaluations114). [[They negatively
evaluate the]{.mark} Arctic [Council because of how it allows
**competitor states influence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This increased US
delegitimation of the Arctic Council is evidence supporting the argument
that increasing security tensions lead to more delegitimation (Table
1\[a\]).

Following this peak, the US continues to make some delegitimation
statements in the second quarter of each year after this, but the number
declines. [[The increase in US]{.mark} discursive
[delegitimation]{.mark} during this period could be [the result
of]{.mark} several factors. First, it may be related to the
**[Trump]{.mark}** administration being in power and its more
[**critical stance** towards **multilateral cooperation**]{.mark},
particularly that focused on climate issues]{.underline}. Second, it may
relate to the increase in geopolitical tensions during this period, when
the US engaged in security and economic competition with other major
powers, especially China and Russia. However, it should be noted that
whenever the US increased delegitimation of the Arctic Council (in 2019
Q2, 2020 Q2, and 2021 Q2), at the same time it also increased
legitimation. This might suggest that the US government maintained a
somewhat ambiguous approach to the organisation, supporting some
elements while challenging others. Its combined (de)legitimation might
not therefore have substantially impacted broader legitimacy beliefs.

This strategic outreach, while shrouded under economic cooperation,
indicates an evolving U.S. posture toward Arctic governance. Trump's
willingness to engage with Putin outside the traditional frameworks
upsets European capitals, already concerned about being excluded from
geopolitical decisions affecting the region. [The Arctic]{.underline},
once a domain of scientific collaboration and environmental diplomacy,
[risks becoming a theatre of transactional deals and territorial
bargaining]{.underline}.

Geopolitical Realignment

[[Trump's Arctic strategy reflects his]{.mark} broader [fo]{.mark}reign
[po]{.mark}licy [posture]{.mark}---[**transactional**, **bilateral**,
and **resource-driven**]{.mark}]{.underline}. With Trump's backing, the
U.S. is pushing for Arctic Security Cutters to bridge the icebreaking
capability gap and counterbalance Russian and Chinese expansion in the
region. Yet, [his growing closeness to Putin **complicates** this
military buildup]{.underline}---[hinting at a scenario where Washington
and Moscow **divide** Arctic interests for mutual **economic
gain**]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, [[Russia's]{.mark} Arctic [diplomacy has evolved to
**exploit** this opening]{.mark}. [Sanctioned and isolated]{.mark} by
Western powers, [Russia seeks limited cooperation with the U.S. to
**ease pressures** on its **Northern Sea Route**
ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline} while simultaneously resisting China's
growing Arctic influence.

The Russia-China engagement in the Arctic is particularly delicate.
While Beijing has deepened its Arctic footprint---declaring itself a
'near-Arctic state' and investing in infrastructure along the Northern
Sea Route---Moscow remains cautious. China's increasing dominance in
financing Arctic energy projects and ports has begun to tilt the balance
of power in favour of Beijing. That Russia was reportedly hesitant to
grant China a stronger role in Arctic governance highlights this unease.

Russia, in turn, is trying to reassert sovereignty and rebalance its
foreign policy. Its move toward bilateral engagement with non-Arctic
partners and plans to develop alternative Arctic governance forums
reflect its intention to diminish Western influence in the region.
Moscow's expansion of its Arctic and Antarctic strategies suggests a
long-term ambition to dominate polar geopolitics and reshape global
governance norms.

End of Circumpolar Consensus?

[[The Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, established in 1996 to
coordinate peaceful cooperation among Arctic states (A8), now [[stands
at a critical juncture]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia's 2022 invasion of
Ukraine already suspended much of its work. Now, [with Trump's possible
**withdrawal** from international institutions, [the]{.mark} very

[[This emerging U.S.-Russia rapprochement could render the Arctic

[destabilize]{.mark} existing [legal frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}
like the Central Arctic Ocean fisheries agreement and the Spitsbergen
Treaty. The result could be a new Arctic order, governed not by
collective interests and environmental norms but by hard power politics
and economic extraction.

[[seven]{.underline}2]{.mark}) (A7) [AC [members announced a]{.mark}
historic **[suspension of]{.mark} participation in [all activities of

Nordic Council of Ministers, the European Commission, the Barents
Euro-Arctic Cooperation (BEAC) and the US, followed in quick succession,
suspending all cooperation with Russia in research, science and
innovation. Finland and Sweden, both AC members, soon submitted
applications for NATO membership and the former became the 31st member
of the Alliance on 4 April 2023.

[Even though the A7 issued a Joint Statement on 8 June 2022, on the

4\. Dilemmas of the Existing International Regulatory Framework in
Addressing FNPPs' Marine Environmental Challenges

Deploying and operating FNPPs often involve multiple countries.
FNPP-related marine environmental challenges cannot be effectively
regulated through the efforts of a single country \[31\]. Therefore, an
effective international regulatory framework is essential in addressing
FNPPs' marine environmental challenges. [While [there is]{.mark}
currently **[no specialized convention]{.mark}** particularly [dedicated
to **regulating FNPPs**]{.mark}, there are several [international
**conventions, protocols, and resolutions**]{.mark} that [may
**involve**]{.mark} the regulation of [FNPPs]{.mark} and their
pollution-related issues. [However, there are]{.mark} still [several
**shortcomings** within]{.mark} the [**existing regulatory framework**
that **hinder** its ability to effectively address]{.mark} the marine
environmental [challenges posed by FNPPs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
existing international regulatory framework is composed of both the
nuclear convention system formulated under **IAEA** auspices and the
maritime convention system formulated under the auspices of the **United
Nations and IMO**]{.underline} (Table 1). [The [**lack** of sufficient
**coordination** between]{.mark} the two [legal systems creates
**fragmentation and complexity**]{.mark} in the international
community's response to radioactive marine pollution]{.underline}.
Efforts have been made to resolve the difficulties and conflicts arising
from the concurrent application of nuclear and maritime conventions
\[53,54\]. However, [the 1971 Convention on Civil Liability for Maritime
Carriage of Nuclear Material has not been widely adopted, with only
seventeen contracting parties and limited state
participation]{.underline} \[55\].

The susceptibility of the Arctic to climate change has led to several
international efforts aimed at encouraging international cooperation,
although the efficacy of these efforts varies \[242\]. [[The Arctic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, formed in 1996, [[is the
premier]{.underline}]{.mark} intergovernmental
[[platform]{.underline}]{.mark} for Arctic governments and Indigenous
communities \[243,244\]. It has played an important role in producing
critical reports, such as the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA),
which highlights the multifaceted effects of warming on the region
\[245\]. The Council supports research and sustainable resource use
through initiatives, such as the Agreement on Enhancing International
Arctic Scientific Cooperation (2017) and the Agreement to Prevent
Unregulated Fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean (2018) \[75\].
[[However, its inability to impose legally binding controls on carbon
emissions or industrial activity limits its overall
effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Paris Agreement (2015), while
global in scope, indirectly addresses Arctic warming by aiming to keep
the global temperature rise to well below 2 °C \[246\]. Arctic-specific
solutions, such as enhanced financial support for adaptation in polar
regions or tighter timelines for emissions reductions in high-latitude
countries, are noticeably lacking \[247\]. Similarly, the Polar Code,
produced by the International Maritime Organisation, establishes rules
for Arctic shipping but calls for broader coverage to offset the hazards
of increased commercial activity, such as stronger limits on black
carbon emissions and ballast water discharge \[248\]. [[The **lack** of
comprehensive agreements explicitly designed to **address** Arctic
concerns, such as]{.underline}]{.mark} regulating [[oil and

But has the international community overlooked another scenario---a
situation in which Russian nuclear use might not only be possible but
even more likely? [What if [Russia resorts to **nuclear use**]{.mark}
not when it's losing---but [when it's **winning**]{.mark} the
war?]{.underline}

The nuclear calculus, then and now. Much is still unknown about Russian
deliberations two years ago, and what ultimately worked to dissuade
Russia from using nuclear weapons then. Likely, it was some combination
of US threat of game-changing consequences for Russia, including
conventional strikes against Russian military assets on occupied
Ukrainian territory, intervention by China that might have come with a
promise of increased conventional military assistance, and the dubious
military utility of battlefield nuclear use. The nuclear use Russia
considered in the fall of 2022 would have been well beyond the pale of
Russia's nuclear doctrine, before and after the announced changes. That
reality points to the limited restraint a declaratory doctrine is likely
to impose on considerations of whether to use nuclear weapons in a war.

Fears of nuclear escalation remain real, and Ukraine's Western partners
continue to carefully consider escalation dynamics when they decide
which weapon systems to release to Ukraine and how to mandate their end
use. The current reticence to allow Ukraine to strike Russian homeland
with Western-supplied weapons is a case in point. The underlying
operating assumption is that Ukraine cannot be too audacious in its
resistance, lest it provokes Russia's nuclear ire.

But what are the nuclear risks of the opposite scenario: when the
conventional fighting in Ukraine shifts decisively in Russia's favor?

[Consider that [the **only** use of nuclear weapons]{.mark} in armed
conflict so far [was by a nuclear power]{.mark} that was [on
a **winning path**]{.mark}. [The **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**
decided to drop two atomic bombs on **Hiroshima** and **Nagasaki** in
August 1945, when Japan was nearly defeated by conventional means, but
stubbornly refused to stop resistance and accept US conditions for
surrender]{.underline}. While reasons and justifications for the US
decision to employ nuclear weapons in Japan are still subject of debate
among historians, it is safe to say that the bombings achieved at least
three goals. They terminated the war with Japan more quickly, possibly
saving the United States from having to mount a costly invasion of the
home islands. They allowed the United States to impose the conditions of
war termination and post-war settlement---that is, unconditional
surrender and US military occupation of Japan. And finally, they made a
strong impression on the Soviet Union.

While historical precedents should not be applied uncritically across
time and context, they can be mined for insights. [[The **set
of incentives** for Russia to resort to nuclear use when it is about to
win in Ukraine
would]{.mark} not [be]{.mark} **dis[similar]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
those animating the US decision in 1945. Perhaps, Putin's mention of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki precedents in his September 2022 speech was more
than a trope.

[[A winning Russia]{.mark} might indeed [have **more to
gain** and **less to lose**]{.mark} from a nuclear
strike]{.underline} than a retreating Russia.

The possible nuclear scenario, if Russia is winning. [Imagine Russia has
broken through Ukraine's defensive lines and is steadily pushing against
stubborn]{.underline} if desperate pockets of
Ukrainian [resistance]{.underline}---a scenario that today looks far
more likely than the sudden routing of Russian troops from Ukraine. With
victory in sight but not yet in hand, [it would
be]{.underline} mighty [tempting for Russia to launch a
**nuclear-armed missile** on a secondary Ukrainian city and demand
Ukraine's]{.underline} immediate and unconditional [surrender or else
another major city would be next.]{.underline}

[[Continued resistance]{.mark} from Kyiv [would be suddenly]{.mark}
rendered **[foolhardy]{.mark}**, if not suicidal. In this scenario, [the
Kremlin could **terminate the
war**]{.mark} more [quickly]{.mark}, with fewer casualties, and [on
**conditions favorable to Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It could impose
on Ukraine unconditional surrender, occupation, and other punishing
conditions it would feel entitled to after a long and costly war. The
prospect of lording over a smoldering radioactive ruin would unlikely be
an obstacle for Russia. The wanton destruction of Mariupol, Bakhmut,
Avdiivka, Marinka, and other Ukrainian
cities by the Russian artillery and bombs before Russia occupied
them resembles what could be achieved by a
single non-strategic nuclear missile, minus efficiency and
radioactivity. And after all, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were rebuilt
in just a few years and are perfectly habitable today.

Russia would still likely incur international political costs for
breaking the eight-decades-long taboo on nuclear use, [but these
**[costs]{.mark}** could be [better **mitigated** by a **winning
Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} than a losing Russia. [The
United States and NATO allies might not deliver on their threat to
impose severe military costs in response to a Russian nuclear strike if
Ukraine looks like a lost cause]{.underline}. [Opprobrium from **China**
will **matter less** to a Russia that **won** its war in
Europe]{.underline}. Finally, Russia's nuclear use is bound to make an
impression in NATO capitals and allow Russia to shape the broader
post-war settlement in Europe to its advantage.

As long as nuclear weapons exist, their use remains possible. In times
of crisis and conflict, their use becomes more probable. Kremlin's heavy
reliance on nuclear rhetoric for political coercion since February 2022
should not obscure the very real danger that Russia might resort to an
actual nuclear strike on battlefield Ukraine. As Western capitals
balance their support for Ukraine with fears of nuclear escalation, they
should bear in mind that [[**allowing** Russia to achieve significant
**military advantage** in Ukraine]{.mark} might [create **greater risk
of nuclear**]{.mark}** weapons [use]{.mark}**]{.underline} than Russia's
retreat.

Renewables are considered by many to be the solution to global warming.
Yes, they can contribute. However, without advanced nuclear energy, we
will not solve global warming. Nuclear energy is much safer than solar
and wind renewables and has a lower life cycle carbon footprint. The
disadvantage of nuclear is its long-lived nuclear waste. To decay to a
nominal background level, legacy spent-nuclear fuel requires tens of
thousands of years. [This paper argues for advanced nuclear, whose much
smaller amount of nuclear waste (about 1% of legacy) will decay to
background levels in about 400 years \[1\]. It is important to note that
legacy [nuclear waste has **minimal risk**]{.mark} associated with it
\[2\]: There is not much of it. [All]{.mark} the [nuclear fuel waste
generated thus far,]{.mark} on the planet, [could be stacked onto one
football field]{.mark} to a height of about 30 feet.]{.underline} It is
a solid, in small pellets contained in metal rods, stored inside
ultrastrong 50-ton containers. [[With **advanced nuclear**, this
**minimal risk is reduced further**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Table 1).
Solar and wind are not really renewable on a 200-year timescale. Neither
is legacy nuclear via current land-based uranium mining. Arguments have
also been made that legacy nuclear is not safe. [[Advanced nuclear
technology is **far safer**]{.mark} than legacy nuclear. The current
widespread [fear]{.mark} of nuclear, which is based on legacy nuclear
accidents, [is unwarranted]{.mark} \[11\]: There were [**no deaths** and
**no negative health effects**]{.mark} from the trivial radiation
release from the Three Mile Island accident. At Fukushima, one power
plant worker involved in recovery died.]{.underline} There were no
deaths or incidents of medical harm to any member of the public from
radiation exposure. Four years later, thorough medical examinations were
given to evacuees from the designated exclusion zone and many concerned
residents from outside the exclusion zone. Nearly a third of a million
children who were age 18 or less at the time of the accident were
screened for thyroid issues. The rate of thyroid anomalies in Fukushima
children was less than in other children in Japan. [Chernobyl was a
**poorly designed** light water boiling reactor susceptible to thermal
runaways.]{.underline} Reported fatalities ranged from 50 at Chernobyl
to several thousand offsite \[12\]. Following the Chernobyl accident,
other Russian RBMK designs were modified to improve safety. Some RBMK
plants have been shut down but not all. No nuclear plants have been
built with this design outside of the Russian federation \[13\].

And Norway, Sweden, and Finland are on different sides of the table in
that thinking; of course, in the words of the politicians, they say "oh
yeah, we need to support the green shift and we need to do that" but
[[everyone knows that Norway\'s main focus is still oil and gas
drilling]{.underline}]{.mark}. I mean, that\'s the reason why we are
millionaires.... I used to say that [[the Norwegians are petroholics. We
know that it is bad, but we can\'t resist]{.underline}]{.mark}. We just
need one more drilling, one more oil platform. "No, yeah, put it away",
like alcohol, you know. Just one more. (Interview, Norway other)

[[The Finnish strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} discussed continued fossil
fuel production in Norway. The plans [[were to provide expertise in

Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} (prior to 2022) [[and
Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}, an issue that was also mentioned in the
interviews. Although we detected only a few direct references in the
strategies to keeping the Arctic area inhabited explicitly through these
plans, it is reasonable to assume that one way to gain positive security
was to connect regime support and unsustainable energy production to
security justifications, even in Finland, which has no oil and gas
production.

Climate change is causing significant environmental and socioeconomic
changes in the Arctic, necessitating the implementation of strong
governance frameworks and adaptation strategies. The combination of
global climate dynamics, Indigenous knowledge systems, and geopolitical
interests has made the Arctic a focus for scientific research and policy
intervention. [[The Arctic Council serves as a major forum for
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} among Arctic nations and Indigenous
organisations \[266\]. It has played an important role in addressing
concerns, such as environmental preservation and sustainable
development, but its non-binding agreements impede enforcement \[32\].
[[Despite these efforts, gaps exist in the management of challenges,
such as increased shipping, resource extraction, and environmental
deterioration]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, the [[rapid
melting]{.underline}]{.mark} of sea ice [[has increased geopolitical
competition]{.underline}]{.mark} for shipping routes and mineral
resources, [[emphasising the need for stronger legal
frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark} \[36,50,267\]. [[International
agreements]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea, [[provide legal processes for settling
disputes]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly those involving marine
boundaries \[268\]. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, there are concerns
that [[these frameworks are insufficient to handle the Arctic's rapid
environmental changes]{.underline}]{.mark} \[212\]. The Arctic Fisheries
Agreement of 2018, which outlaws unregulated fishing in the central
Arctic Ocean, is a recent example of effective international cooperation

are generally smaller in explosive power and could be launched from

His [threats]{.underline} [include]{.underline} [preemptive]{.underline} [strikes]{.underline} [against

the [[U.S. and NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} [have]{.underline} their own

result is that many officials view the problem of tactical nuclear
weapons as serious but not urgent. Earlier this month, U.S. Director of
National Intelligence Avril Haines told a Senate hearing that Putin\'s
weakened conventional force would make him more reliant on \"asymmetric
options,\" including nuclear capabilities, for deterrence, but that it
was \"very unlikely\" that Moscow would use nuclear weapons in its war
against Ukraine. Speaking at the same hearing, the director of the
Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, also assessed the
chances as \"unlikely.\"

In
fact, [the]{.underline} [evidence]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [strong]{.underline} [that
the]{.underline} [problem]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [urgent]{.underline} and
I argue that [Putin will use a tactical nuclear weapon in his war in
Ukraine]{.underline}. [Western leaders need not wonder about Putin\'s

view. [Putin]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [not]{.underline} [waiting]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [misstep]{.underline} [by
the West.]{.underline} He has been building the conditions for nuclear
use in Ukraine since early in the war and is ready to use a nuclear
weapon whenever he decides, most likely in response to his faltering
military\'s inability to escalate as much as he wishes by conventional
means. This article will not consider exhaustively what may prompt
Putin\'s decision, but we should not fool ourselves by thinking we can
prevent it. Instead, we should prepare responses for a new world in
which the nuclear genie is out of the bottle.

Russia's Increased Reliance on Nuclear Weapons

For much of the past 80 years, Russia's security has rested on two
pillars whose relative strength has waxed and waned --- its conventional
ground forces and its nuclear weapons. The conventional forces have been
used to influence, bully and force Russia's neighbors and adversaries to
bend to its will. The nuclear forces were intended to deter the United
States and the West from interfering militarily in Russia and its
perceived zone of influence. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia's
conventional forces have at times struggled with their share of the
task. To compensate, Russian leaders have had to rely on their nuclear
forces to do both: strategic nuclear weapons to deter the West and
tactical nuclear weapons to threaten neighbors.

In today\'s situation, [[a single]{.mark} nuclear [strike]{.mark} in
Ukraine [could thwart a Ukrainian counterattack with little loss of
Russian lives]{.mark}. For Moscow, this consideration is as
much **practical** as it is moral or image-related]{.underline}: Last
year\'s large-scale mobilization and increase in military units showed
that Putin\'s army was too small for its task. Nevertheless, Russia has
managed to create only a few new battalions because most new personnel
and equipment went to replace losses in existing units. Putin and his
military leaders are running out of the people and materiel needed to
achieve his goals.

Russian military and security experts have been noting this greater
reliance on nuclear weapons for years. In 2000, responding to the U.S.
bombing of former Yugoslavia, Russian international affairs expert and
former lawmaker Alexey Arbatov described how Moscow's response could be
"to enhance its nuclear forces to deter not just nuclear, but also,
large--scale conventional attacks of the type demonstrated in the
Balkans." He likewise described a view some say Putin has embraced: that
"a suicidal threat of nuclear escalation could present a credible
deterrent against a full-scale, theater-wide conventional aggression ---
including major ground warfare."

Putin Prepares for a Nuclear Strike

In the first three months of 2023, Putin took several public steps to
demonstrate that he is not bluffing about the use of nuclear weapons.

In February, he signed a law "suspending" Russia's participation in the
strategic nuclear arms treaty New START. This step
officially ended joint inspections of American and Russian
nuclear weapons sites and released Russia from limiting its number of
strategic nuclear weapons, Russian promises to remain limited
notwithstanding.

In March, Putin announced that he
would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus this year, building a
storage facility to house them, to be completed as early as July. Since
Russia has already deployed nuclear-capable Iskander ground-launched
missile systems and thousands of troops to Belarus, this would put
nuclear delivery systems and warheads in close proximity to one another,
greatly reducing the warning time of their use. Putin noted that Russian
trainers would also train Belarussian forces to use the weapons. Analyst
Dmitri Trenin, former director of the now-defunct Carnegie Moscow Center
and a retired Soviet military officer, observed that the Belarus
deployment "demonstrates that the conflict between Russia and the West
is developing into an armed clash between Russia and NATO, and is a
signal to Washington that further American/Western involvement in the
military conflict in Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons."

Putin has taken these increasingly threatening steps in the belief that
NATO and the West --- in particular, the United States --- are not
listening to him as he proclaims Russia's demands on the international
stage. In 2018, when Putin unveiled a bevy of new nuclear weapons, he
warned: "You will listen to us now!" Four years later, his invasion of
Ukraine was a wakeup call for those in the West who were still not
listening.

Even after the invasion though, some in Russia undoubtedly fear that the
threat of a nuclear strike has begun to ring hollow. For Putin, whose
regime is at risk, in my view, continuing to threaten a tactical nuclear
attack in Ukraine without doing it carries perhaps as much risk as doing
it. To remind the West of the destructive power of a nuclear weapon,
Putin and his generals may decide it is necessary to explode such a
weapon. This would enable Russia to escalate the war to its tactical
advantage and let Putin prove he is no bluffer.

[Besides warning the West many times that he might use a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}, [Putin and his leadership have, step by
step, prepared the Russian people with reasons why he should use nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

[[Among]{.mark} these [justifications, Putin has repeatedly
invoked]{.mark} \"whataboutist\" **[comparisons to the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**. When announcing plans for deployment
of Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus]{.underline} on Russian state
television, [[he said: \"The United States
has been doing this for **decades**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They have long
... deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their
allied countries, NATO countries, in Europe, in six states. ... [[We are
going to **do the same thing**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" Putin has also
several times referenced American nuclear strikes on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki and equated American goals then --- to save soldiers' lives and
shorten the war --- with Russian goals today.

[Putin has also made clear to the Russian people
that **Moscow\'s red lines** for the use of nuclear weapons, spelled out
in its official documents, **have all been crossed** in the
conflict in Ukraine]{.underline}. These include "aggression with
conventional weapons against the Russian Federation, when the very
existence of the state is threatened." Putin has repeatedly claimed that
the very survival of Russia is at stake in the current struggle. At this
month\'s Victory Day parade, he claimed that the West's "goal is to
achieve the collapse and destruction of our country." He asserts that
Crimea and other Ukrainian lands are Russian territory, meaning that,
from Putin's perspective, battles that were occurring on Ukrainian land
one day are suddenly happening on Russian land. Another of Russia\'s
officially designated red lines for nuclear use is "attacks ... against
critical governmental or military sites of the Russian Federation,
disruption of which would undermine nuclear forces\' response actions."
Russia has claimed that Ukrainian drones have struck Russian strategic
nuclear bombers inside Russia, and that Ukraine and the U.S. are
responsible for drones launched to assassinate Putin. All
these claims, real and fabricated, are used
to establish the pretext for Putin to use nuclear weapons when he
decides.

Some Western observers of the Russian military claim that because we
have not yet seen any movement of nuclear weapons, we have no tangible
signs of intent to use them. I disagree.

First of all, last fall, Kyiv officials reported that Russia was
firing "Kh-55 nuclear cruise missiles" with dummy warheads. Observers
suggested these missiles --- which are designed to carry only a nuclear
weapon --- were launched to erode Ukrainian air defenses by \"decoying\"
them into destroying the Kh-55s rather than missiles with conventional
explosives. This claim makes little sense: Missiles, even unarmed, would
be too valuable to shorthanded Russia to use as decoys. But launching
the Cold War-era missiles with dummy warheads to test their reliability
and readiness for use in a real nuclear strike would be a good reason
for what we saw.

Another sign of Russia's increasing readiness to use nuclear weapons is
the most recent change in the leadership of the war, which both
underscores Putin\'s message that Russia is fighting for its survival
and puts at the helm the very men who are in charge of Russia\'s
tactical nuclear weapons. In January, Putin appointed his chief of
the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, to head the military operation in
Ukraine. (Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the change was connected
to a coming "expansion in the scope of \[the war's\] tasks.") Not since
the second world war has the chief of the general staff been in command
of a military operation for Russia. Putin also appointed two generals to
be Gerasimov's main deputies in the war, Gen. Oleg Salyukov, head of
Russia's ground forces, and Gen. Sergei Surovikin, head of Russia's
aerospace forces. This is even more worrisome since, under Russian
doctrine, the chief of the general staff and the heads of the ground and
aerospace forces are the three officers who control all tactical nuclear
weapons use in ground operations. Putin has now placed in direct control
of the war the three senior-most officers who have the authority to
employ tactical nuclear weapons when he gives the order.

When these developments are coupled with the impending deployment of
tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, nearer Ukraine, we can no longer
pretend there are no tangible signs of intent.

Trigger for Nuclear Use

With the groundwork laid to justify a tactical nuclear strike in
Ukraine, what will trigger Putin's decision to launch? Most likely it
will be the inability of the Russian military to escalate the war by
conventional means when Putin demands. For example, if a Ukrainian
offensive threatens the loss of Crimea or the provinces that form the
land bridge to it, Putin would demand an escalation of the fighting to
prevent that loss. If the conventional forces could not successfully
respond, however, a nuclear strike against the Ukrainian forces would be
the only way to escalate. On the night Putin illegally added four
Ukrainian provinces to Russia, he declared, "If the territorial unity of
our country is threatened, in order to protect Russia and our nation, we
will unquestionably use all the weapons we have. This is no bluff."

Putin is also under pressure to escalate the
war from Russian nationalists. These groups have supported Putin in
his rise to power, but now are vocal in their dissatisfaction with the
conduct of the war. Some, like former FSB officer Igor Girkin, openly
criticize the senior military leadership and even Putin. That criticism
may be morphing into opposition, forcing Putin to consider escalating
his war before his conventional forces are ready.

Claims that Putin would be dissuaded from using nuclear weapons by
important partners like China or India are belied by experience thus far
in the war. Although Putin values the support of others, he has not
shied from putting that support at risk to get what he wants.

None of this is to say that we in the West should pressure Ukraine to
forgo its goal to liberate all seized territory. But it does mean that
we should anticipate a nuclear weapon will be used and develop our
possible responses accordingly.

Normalizing Nuclear Weapons

[As]{.underline} [soon as Russia uses a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the
"fallout" will begin and spread]{.underline}. Tens of thousands of
Ukrainians will be dead, suffering or dealing with the effects of the
nuclear explosion. [Hundreds of millions of Europeans will be bracing
for war]{.underline}. But 7 billion others around the globe will go
about their business, alarmed to be sure, but physically unaffected by a
nuclear explosion in Ukraine. [This last [outcome of a Russian]{.mark}
tactical [nuclear strike]{.mark} may ultimately be
the]{.underline} [most]{.underline} [dangerous]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [international]{.underline} [order.
The image that many people have of nuclear arms as civilization-ending
weapons will be erased. In its place, [people will see these weapons as
**normal** and]{.mark}, although tragic, **[acceptable in
war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Just a "bigger bullet." It is in this
dramatically changed context that the United States will have to decide
how to respond.

But now, eight years after Fukushima, the best-available science clearly
shows that Caldicott's estimate of the number of people killed by
nuclear accidents was off by one million. Radiation from Chernobyl will
kill, at most, 200 people, while the radiation from Fukushima and Three
Mile Island will kill zero people. In other words, [[the
main]{.underline} [lesson]{.underline} [that should be
drawn]{.underline} [from]{.underline} **[the worst nuclear
accidents]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
[nuclear]{.underline} [energy]{.underline} [has]{.underline} **[always
been inherently safe]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The truth about nuclear
power's safety is so shocking that it's worth taking a closer look at
the worst accidents, starting with the worst of the worst: Chernobyl.
The nuclear plant is in Ukraine which, in 1986, the year of the
accident, was a Soviet Republic. Operators lost control of an
unauthorized experiment that resulted in the reactor catching fire.
There was no containment dome, and the fire spewed out radioactive
particulate matter, which went all over the world, leading many to
conclude that Chernobyl is not just the worst nuclear accident in
history but is also the worst nuclear accident possible. Twenty-eight
firefighters died after putting out the Chernobyl fire. While the death
of any firefighter is tragic, it's worth putting that number in
perspective. Eighty-six firefighters died in the U.S. in 2018, and 343
firefighters died during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Since
the Chernobyl accident, 19 first responders have died, according to the
United Nations, for "various reasons" including tuberculosis, cirrhosis
of the liver, heart attacks, and trauma. The U.N. concluded that "the
assignment of radiation as the cause of death has become less clear."
What about cancer? By 2065 there may be 16,000 thyroid cancers; to date
there have been 6,000. Since thyroid cancer has a mortality rate of just
one percent --- it is an easy cancer to treat --- expected deaths may be
160. The World Health Organization claims on its web site that Chernobyl
could result in the premature [[deaths of 4,000 people]{.mark}, but
according to Dr. Geraldine Thomas, [who started and runs the Chernobyl
Tissue Bank, that number is based on]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[a
disproven methodology]{.underline}**]{.mark}. "That WHO number is based
on LNT," she explained, using the acronym for the "linear no-threshold"
method of extrapolating deaths from radiation. LNT assumes that there is
no threshold below which radiation is safe, but that assumption has been
discredited over recent decades **[by [multiple sources of
data]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Support for the idea that radiation is
harmless at low levels comes from the fact that people who live in
places with higher background radiation, like Colorado, do not suffer
elevated rates of cancer. In fact, residents of Colorado, where
radiation is higher because of high concentrations of uranium in the
ground, enjoy some of the lowest cancer rates in the U.S. Even
relatively high doses of radiation cause far less harm than most people
think. Careful, large, and long-term studies of survivors of the atomic
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki offer compelling demonstration.
[[Cancer rates were]{.underline} **[just 10 percent higher among atomic
blast survivors]{.underline}**]{.mark}, most of whom never got cancer.
Even those who received a dose 1,000 times higher than today's safety
limit saw their lives cut short by an average of 16 months. But didn't
the Japanese government recently award a financial settlement to the
family of a Fukushima worker who claimed his cancer was from the
accident? It did, but for reasons that were clearly political, and
having to do with the Japanese government's consensus-based,
conflict-averse style, as well as lingering guilt felt by elite
policymakers toward Fukushima workers and residents, who felt doubly
aggrieved by the tsunami and meltdowns. The worker's cancer was highly
unlikely to have come from Fukushima because, once again, the level of
radiation workers received was far lower than the ones received by the
Hiroshima/Nagasaki cohort that saw (modestly) higher cancer rates. What
about Three Mile Island? After the accident in 1979, Time Magazine ran a
cover story that superimposed a glowing headline, "Nuclear Nightmare,"
over an image of the plant. [**[Nightmare? More like a
dream.]{.underline}** [What other]{.underline} **[major industrial
tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}[nology]{.underline} [[can
suffer]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [catastrophic failure and **not kill
anyone**]{.underline}]{.mark}? Remember when the Deepwater Horizon oil
drilling rig caught on fire and killed 11 people? Four months later, a
Pacific Gas & Electric natural gas pipeline exploded just south of San
Francisco and killed eight people sleeping in their beds. And that was
just one year, 2010. The worst energy accident of all time was the 1975
collapse of the Banqiao hydroelectric dam in China. It collapsed and
killed between 170,000 and 230,000 people. Nuclear's worst accidents
show that the technology has always been safe for the same, inherent
reason that it has always had such a small environmental impact: the
high energy density of its fuel. Splitting atoms to create heat, rather
than than splitting chemical bonds through fire, requires tiny amounts
of fuel. A single Coke can of uranium can provide enough energy for an
entire high-energy life. When the worst occurs, and the fuel melts, the
amount of particulate matter that escapes from the plant is
insignificant in contrast to both the fiery explosions of fossil fuels
and the daily emission of particulate matter from fossil- and
biomass-burning homes, cars, and power plants, which kill seven million
people a year. It\'s not that nuclear energy never kills. It\'s that
nuclear\'s death toll is vanishingly small. Consider nuclear\'s global
death toll in context. These are just annual deaths. - walking:
270,000 - driving: 1,350,000 - working: 2,300,000 - air pollution:
4,200,000 By contrast, nuclear\'s death total is likely to be around
200.

One persistent concern opponents of nuclear power often voice is [[the
risk of reactor cooling systems **failing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
th[[is **not an issue**]{.underline} [with the **new** generation of
nuclear designs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fukushima Daiichi NPP's
water-based cooling system stopped when a tsunami disabled the
electricity source powering the circulation. This is the same risk
Ukraine's Zaporizhzhye NPP is facing thanks to Russia bombing the dam
that held the water that kept the plant's water cooling system
operating. In emerging advanced reactor technologies, however, this
vulnerability is eliminated entirely. [[Many of the]{.underline} [new
designs]{.underline} [have entirely reconsidered systems with passive
safety features that]{.underline} [maintain cooling **without** reliance
on external power]{.underline}.]{.mark} Others use water in innovative
ways. [GE
Hitachi's]{.underline} [BWRX-300]{.underline} [SMR]{.underline} [is
designed for the water inside to boil, creating]{.underline} [its own
convection that]{.underline} [in turn]{.underline} [powers its own
cooling circulation]{.underline}. [[This]{.underline} [eliminates the
need for]{.underline} [an]{.underline} [extensive circulation system of
pipes and keeps all potentially contaminated water **inside the
plant**]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Some also use materials other than water,
such as molten salts.]{.underline}

#### Specifically, they're [safer]{.underline} due to [new]{.underline} [tech]{.underline}.

The preferred design is a functional-flow steam generator with
functional body movement in tubes with coiled surfaces \[14\]. OECD
\[11\] indicated that worldwide policy-making bodies, enterprises of the
nuclear sector, and energy analysts show growing interest in the
potential of SMR as a competitive element of low-carbon technologies
used in integrated energy systems of the future. In
addition, [**[SMRs]{.underline}** [embody]{.underline} [hopes
for]{.underline} [inherent]{.underline} [**safety**, simplification, and
standardization properties]{.underline}]{.mark}. [All of this can
significantly facilitate and make nuclear power more
cost-effective]{.underline}. [[SMRs can be placed directly in energy
consumption centers. It eliminates the need for external power lines and
maintenance in difficult climatic and terrain
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Significant reduction in network
infrastructure]{.underline} [costs]{.underline} [allows
for]{.underline} [increased]{.underline} [efficiency]{.underline} [and
competitiveness of SMR technologies]{.underline} \[54\]. [Gaspar \[55\]
emphasizes that]{.underline} [[SMRs are smaller and
use]{.underline} [innovative]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}[nologies]{.underline} [[with]{.underline} [many]{.underline} [built-in
safety features]{.underline}]{.mark}. [An important element of their
design
is]{.underline} [minimizing]{.underline} [**accidents **and]{.underline} [radioactive]{.underline} **[emissions]{.underline}**. [A
similar opinion was expressed by Zhou \[14\]:
"**SMR**]{.underline} [possess]{.underline} [better safety
characteristics and]{.underline} [lower amount
of]{.underline} **[radioactive materials]{.underline}** [(less potential
for radioactive release); it is expected that]{.underline} **[iodine
prophylaxis, shelter, evacuation]{.underline}** [will not be needed to
protect public from the SMR".]{.underline}

Considering SMR according to various criteria characterizing their
advantages, we will describe the "safety" criteria and its indicators
based on \[11\]: • reducing the level the severity of emergency modes (a
combination of increased levels of simplification and structural
integrity is expressed in a smaller number of emergency modes); [•
[efficiency of]{.mark}]{.underline}[ **[passive safety
systems]{.underline}**]{.mark} [(need for active systems decreases,
[which in the long run **simplifies** safety
assessment,]{.mark}]{.underline}[ [reduces]{.underline} [the number
of]{.underline} [emergency modes, and **improves the reactor
cooling**]{.underline}]{.mark} [mode using natural
circulation]{.underline}. [All]{.underline} [this contributes to
increasing the time]{.underline} [provided]{.underline} [for emergency
response); • reduced protective zone outside the site (less need for
shielding means and a smaller area of the zone for planning protective
measures).]{.underline}

#### And they solve [back]{.underline}-[end]{.underline} [waste]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} [nuclear
waste]{.underline} [attributes]{.underline} [of]{.underline} Small
Modular Reactors ([[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}) [scheduled for deployment
this
decade]{.underline} [[were]{.underline} [assessed]{.underline} [using
**established** nuclear waste **metrics**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
metrics include the [DU mass, SNF mass, volume, activity, decay heat and
radiotoxicity, and decommissioning LLW volumes.]{.underline} All metrics
were normalized to the unit electricity generation and compared to a
reference large PWR. [Three SMRs]{.underline}, VOYGR, Natrium, and
Xe-100, [were selected because they represent a range of reactor
and]{.underline} fuel technologies[, have been designed to provide
improved performance, and are all active designs scheduled to be
deployed by the decade\'s end.]{.underline}

[The nuclear waste attributes of the SMRs]{.underline} studied [show
some]{.underline} **[similarities]{.underline}** [to the reference
PWR]{.underline} and some significant differences caused by
reactor-specific design features with advanced coolants, fuel forms, and
reactor configuration. [[Front-end waste
attribute]{.underline}]{.mark} (DU mass) from SMR fuel
production [[range from]{.underline} [equivalent]{.underline} [to 1.2
times the reference PWR]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} [Back-end
waste attributes]{.underline} for spent fuel disposition [vary
from]{.underline} **[large
reductions]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [small]{.underline} [to
moderate]{.underline} [increases]{.underline} [in the SNF
mass]{.underline} (factors of 0.2--1.2), [activity]{.underline} (factors
of 0.4--1.4), [and radiotoxicity]{.underline} (factors of 0.3--1.5).
These differences have a limited impact on long-term repository
isolation. SMR designs can vary significantly (factors of 0.6--12.3) in
the SNF volume (and thus heat generation density). However,
these [[differences are]{.underline} **[readily
amenable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [design]{.underline} [optimization]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [handling,
storage, transportation, and disposal technologies]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Waste attributes from decommissioning vary depending on design and
decommissioning technology choices.

Given the analysis results in this study and assuming appropriate waste
management system design and operational optimization, [[there appear to
be]{.underline} **[no major
challenges]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [managing]{.underline} [SMR
nuclear wastes]{.underline} [compared to the reference PWR nuclear
waste]{.underline}]{.mark}[s]{.underline}. The results of this study are
only applicable to a once-through fuel cycle. [[Any of these reactors,
including the reference PWR,]{.underline} [could be used
with]{.underline} [**fuel recycle**, resulting
in]{.underline} **[reductions]{.underline}** [in most waste
attributes]{.underline},]{.mark} as indicated in the E&S study
\[[1]{.underline}\].
