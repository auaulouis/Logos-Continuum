### Notes

#### Must be read and extended with PTX DA to be worth anything. There is no internal net benefit to this counterplan. 

#### *[EWS/Security]{.underline}*: This is the weak spot. In security and international situations, the fed takes over the National Guard (which is who the CP uses to solve.) Be prepared to concede the perm as a test of competition and kick out. 

#### *[Drilling]{.underline}*: Pretty good against drilling, but the Aff has access to good jurisdiction deficits. Most oil exists far off Alaska's shore in areas where only the federal government has jurisdiction, and it's somewhat unlikely that the Alaskan government could authorize drilling here. However, the NEG can overcome this by arguing that the CP would be met with federal follow-on.

#### *[Renewables]{.underline}*: Pretty strong against renewables -- it's all a debate about whether federal funds are key or not. 

#### *[Science Cooperation]{.underline}*: This Aff is tricky, it's going to come down to interpretations of who is actually doing the "science." I feel its safe to assume the Aff is non-governmental researchers (university researchers and private scientists, for example) in which case there really isn't a Fed Key warrant. 

## 1NC\-\--Alaska CP vs. EWS

### 1NC\-\--OFF

#### The state government of Alaska should use a Unified Command through the Arctic 7 for coordinated development of early warning systems in the Arctic, including sensors, drones, submarines, and satellites to monitor shipping, military assets, and the environment.

#### State-level co-op over [security]{.underline} and [military]{.underline} [cooperation]{.underline} is [frequent]{.underline} with [no]{.underline} federal [pre]{.underline}-[emption]{.underline}\-\--Congress just [doesn't]{.underline} [know]{.underline} or [care]{.underline}.

[In reality, [Congress **rarely**]{.mark} has any chance to [opine on
what states]{.mark} propose to [do with foreign governments]{.mark}.
Why? U.S. **[states simply do not submit their arrangements]{.mark} with
foreign powers** to Congress [for approval]{.mark}]{.underline}. 35
Thus, [[Congress **frequently** has **no knowledge** - let alone views
on - what the states might be doing]{.mark} abroad]{.underline}.36 But
make no mistake - [U.S. states have **very active international
agendas**]{.underline}. Since North Carolina Governor Luther Hodges
first led a gubernatorial trade mission to Western Europe in 1959,
[state engagements with foreign governments have **risen
dramatically**]{.underline}. 37 [U.S. states now interact **directly**
with foreign sovereigns and sub-national governments on a **regular
basis**]{.underline}.38

[[These interactions have]{.mark} in turn [produced **hundreds** of
written **agreements** between U.S. states and foreign governmental
entities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finding these agreements poses a
challenge; no centralized or coordinated reporting system exists and
copies are often not made public. Still, the available evidence shows
that in contrast with the limited scope of congressionally approved
foreign compacts (cross-border bridges, fires, and emergencies), these
foreign agreements cut a much broader swath in terms of parties, topics,
and functions.

[Canadian provinces and Mexican states remain among their most frequent
partners, but U.S. states\' foreign agreements include other national
and sub-national governments]{.underline} from the likes of Australia,
China, Israel, Moldova, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United
Kingdom.39 [[They cover an array of topics, including]{.mark}
agriculture, **climate change**, education, **energy**, **environmental
cooperation**, family support, **hazardous waste**, [**homeland
security**, **investment**, **military cooperation**]{.mark},
**pollution**, sister-state relations, tourism, trade, transportation,
and, of course, water issues]{.underline}. In terms of content,
[[foreign agreements perform a variety of functions, ranging
from]{.underline}]{.mark} (a) \"passive\" joint declarations or
statements of common policies; 4 [(b) [agreements to
**cooperate**]{.mark} whether generally, [via an **action
plan**]{.mark}, or through the creation of some institutional
entity;]{.underline}42 [(c) isolated agreements committing to [a
**particular project or activity**]{.mark}]{.underline};43 [[to]{.mark}
(d) **regulatory agreements** [laying out **normative expectations**
for]{.mark} participant [behavior in **particular
areas**]{.mark}.]{.underline}44

[What has **[Congress do]{.mark}ne** in the face of such a regular (and
even robust) U.S. state practice? **Virtually
[nothing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Congressional **[inaction serves as
the operating norm]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some might question if
Congress has done so little because foreign agreements mean little;
i.e., its silence is a function of the agreements\' political
insignificance. But congressional silence holds true even when foreign
agreements implicate significant foreign relations questions or create
organizational structures patterning future U.S. state behavior.

For example, Congress had nothing to say in October 2007 when ten U.S.
states joined ten European nation states, the European Commission, two
Canadian provinces and New Zealand to form an \"International Carbon
Action Partnership\" (ICAP) to promote cap and trade carbon markets to
combat global warming.45 This partnership operates in tension with a
White House (and Congress) uncommitted to such markets and ongoing U.S.
negotiations with many of the same ICAP participants on this very topic.
46 Similarly, notwithstanding its 1968 objection to Canadian
participation, Congress has yet to opine on a December 13, 2005 Great
Lakes Agreement that does include Canadian participation in a Regional
Body advising U.S. states on water diversions. Nor did Congress react to
Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius\'s 2003 agreement with Alimport -
Cuba\'s food trade agency - that reportedly contemplated Cuban purchases
of \$10 million in Kansas agricultural products in return for the Kansas
A government\'s commitment to encourage a change in U.S. policy toward
Cuba.

In sum, looking to Congress for details on its Compact Clause power in
the foreign context proves a nearly fruitless exercise. Congress has
done little to agree to foreign compacts, little to object to them, and
little to even monitor what U.S. states actually do abroad. [[The
**Compact Clause**]{.mark} as it applies to foreign actors [lies
**effectively dormant**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

INTRODUCTION The federalist system of government in the United States
has the potential to achieve greater efficiency in the provision of
public goods than a unitary system. Local and [[state
governments]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[make decisions]{.mark} that are
in their citizens\' best interests [**without** imposing]{.mark}
**significant [costs]{.mark}** [on the country]{.mark}]{.underline} as a
whole. Moreover, society can benefit from having a diversity of types
and amounts of public goods. Because individuals have different
preferences---for public as well as private good---they will choose the
mix of goods that is right for them. They can do this by moving to the
community that provides the right mix.1 A federalist system also has the
flexibility to allow some things to be left to the national
government---provision of national defense, for example, or any public
good where the benefits accrue to multiple jurisdictions.

On the other hand, [federalism can sometimes **create conflicts** among
jurisdictions]{.underline}. For example, a state could have a policy at
odds with the objectives of the national government or another state. In
theory, solutions to such problems exist, but in practice there can be
impediments to their use.

This paper explores the relationship between federalism and natural
resources in the United States, in particular the oil and gas resources
of the Outer Continental Shelf. The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) is the
land under the oceans from state water boundaries (3 miles offshore, in
most cases) to 200 miles offshore. [[The federal government has
**jurisdiction**]{.mark} and control [over the **OCS**]{.mark} and
**leases** portions of it to **private corporations** [for]{.mark} the
purpose of **exploring** for]{.underline}, developing, and producing
[[**oil** and **gas**]{.mark}. The OCS Lands Act Amendments]{.underline}
(OCSLAA) of 1978 [state that federal government **policies** and
**procedures** should \"**expedite exploration** and development on the
OCS]{.underline} in order to achieve national economic and energy goals,
assure national security, reduce dependence on foreign sources, and
maintain a favorable balance of payments in world trade.\"2

This \"energy security\" goal is clearly the main one pursued by the
federal government, but the OCSLAA also state that policies should
\"balance orderly energy resource development with protection of the
human, marine, and coastal environments.\"3

The [[state]{.mark} and local [governments have a **voice** in
**OCS**]{.mark} **activities** primarily through [the **Coastal Zone
Management Act**]{.mark}]{.underline} (CZMA). The \"consistency
provision\" of [the CZMA **[requires]{.mark}** that [all federal
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}, including OCS licensing and permitting,
[that affect a state\'s coastal zone [be \"**consistent with**\" the
state\'s coastal]{.mark} zone [management]{.mark} plan]{.underline}. In
recent years, and especially during the accelerated leasing program of
the 1980s, the states---in particular,
[[California]{.underline}]{.mark}---have [[called on the]{.mark}
consistency [provision a **great deal**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a
result, they have managed to delay lease sales, impose restrictions on
activities on leases, and delay exploration plans, development activity,
and production. [Two to **three years** usually pass between the time a
lease sale is **proposed**]{.underline} by the federal government [and
the time it is actually **held**. The time between sale and actual
**production**]{.underline} of oil and gas from a tract [can also amount
to **several years**]{.underline}. Expenditures on OCS-related
litigation are substantial.4

This paper analyzes the OCS in a public good framework and assesses the
economic efficiency aspects of federal versus state jurisdiction. The
paper argues that [state jurisdiction would be **more efficient** than
federal]{.underline}, particularly the current system of federal
jurisdiction with state involvement through the CZMA.

State governments have an incentive to take only the costs and benefits
of their own citizens into account. Therefore, in order for the level of
OCS resource development under state control to be efficient, there must
be no external costs or benefits---i.e., no costs or benefits that
accrue to citizens outside the coastal state. If such external costs or
benefits exist, there may be a role for the federal government. The
paper identifies two possible externalities: energy security benefits
from OCS development and environmental benefits from not developing.5

This paper finds that the argument that energy security is enhanced by
developing OCS oil and gas is flawed. It also concludes that [any
external environmental [benefits from]{.mark} not developing [the
**OCS** can be **incorporated** into]{.mark} coastal states\'
[decisionmaking through federal]{.mark} government **[grants]{.mark}**
similar to]{.underline} those provided by [the CZMA]{.underline}. These
findings suggest that [coastal [**state** control over]{.mark} the
[**OCS** should be **preferred** to **federal**]{.mark}
control.]{.underline}

[minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}** responsibly along with the bridge fuels
of LNG and oil without wasteful flaring -- all [[under the **highest**
environmental **standards**]{.mark} in the world.]{.underline}

Shutting down Alaska's economy will do more than deprive of us of the
resources we need to pursue these initiatives. [[Resource

[If you care about the environment, we need to produce resources in
Alaska]{.underline}. If you care about social justice, we need to
produce resources in Alaska. If you care about enriching people and not
dictators, we need to produce resources in Alaska.

[[Despite]{.mark} the [hesitant]{.mark} pace of [**environmental
policy** at the **national** level, there is a proliferation of
environmental policy at the **state level**, where "a]{.mark}n almost
[**stealth-like** process of policy development" has been underway
for]{.mark} over **two [decades]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Rabe, 2004:11).
Many state governments have determined that environmental policy is
necessary and feasible, and have experimented with several different
policy approaches, particularly on the question of facilitating
alternative energy.

[These [state policies]{.mark} are surprising in many ways. For example,
they [are often driven by **bipartisan coalitions**]{.mark}, and,
perhaps [because of their **lower visibility**]{.mark}, they [seem to
have **escaped** the **partisan wrangling** that]{.mark} has [limited

Christine Todd Whitman were pioneers of alternative energy policy at the
state level, as governors of Texas and New Jersey respectively, before
they went on to obstruct environmental policy at the federal level as
president and head of the EPA (Rabe, 2004: 1). Texas, a state that
produces reliably conservative and anti-environmental contingents at the
national level, is a leader in wind energy (Rabe, 2004: 50).

Environmental [policy-making at the state level is **pragmatic** and

Because electricity generation accounts for 41% of all CO2 emissions and
is the largest single source of CO2 emissions (EPA, 2011:ES-8; Carley,
2011), many states have focused their efforts on the electric power
sector. One of the main sites of policy innovation has been the attempt
to increase the generation of electricity from renewable sources.

Policy Diffusion

Since Walker's (1969) seminal article on policy diffusion, scholars have
followed suit and examined how [**[states' policies]{.mark}**,
particularly innovative ones, **[spread]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Policy
agendas are influenced by multiple factors and diffuse accordingly. Some
of those sources are internal to the state while others originate
outside any particular state and may affect multiple states. These
external influences are termed horizontal (also called lateral) or
vertical. Examples of horizontal factors include the influences of
neighboring states (Berry and Berry 1990), as well as governors'
associations both general and partisan.

[Vertical factors of diffusion]{.underline} may start at the national
level and [include the President, Congress, or the federal
courts]{.underline} (Eshbaugh-Soha and Peake 2005). The vertical
relationship need not be exclusively from the top down. [It is possible
that states may be the [**stimulators** of **policy priorities** for the
**national level**, exemplifying states']{.mark} so-called [role as
"**laboratories** for]{.mark} policy [innovation" and demonstrating a
**bottom-up** approach to policy **adoption**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Lowery et al. 2011). [Policies may percolate up [to the **federal
level**]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as trickle down to the states and
local communities.1 In short, "the agenda setting process seems to
operate in both bottom-up and top-down fashion" (Karch 2007, 68). Though
this is likely the case, most scholarship in this area tends to examine
either bottom-up or top-down diffusion, but not both.

In this study, we are concerned with the interplay between national and
state policy agendas---or vertical diffusion. We ask the following
questions: is attention to particular political issues by the states
demonstrated in their chief executives' policy priorities reflected in
those of national political actors? Likewise, do governors take their
policy cues from presidents and/or Congress? Finally, does the type of
policy matter in the nature of the interplay between levels of
government?

Vertical Diffusion between States and Federal Actors

In their role as laboratories of democracy, [[increased]{.mark} policy
[attention at the state level]{.mark} may be a [cue]{.mark} to [the
federal government that these **policy areas need national
action**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the other hand, Karch, notes
"[National activity...is an important causal mechanism that can [foster
the **widespread consideration**]{.mark} of a policy innovation [by
increasing its political salience]{.mark}]{.underline}" (2007, 68). And,
Berry and Berry (1999) suggest that the top-down aspect of policy
diffusion should be included in models of state policy diffusion more
generally. Finally, the power of the federal government in setting the
nation's agenda has been found in other scholarship, especially when it
emanates from the President, the agenda setter in chief. Presidents'
agendas have been shown to affect a variety of other recipients,
including Congress (Eshbaugh-Soha and Peake 2005; Edwards and Wood
1999), the public (Cohen 1995) and the media (Peake and Eshbaugh-Soha
2004; Edwards and Wood 1999). In sum, there are reasons to expect that
[[**governors' policy priorities** may]{.underline}]{.mark} be
susceptible to national influences and **[[influence their national
counterpart]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The scholarship in both areas is,
however, less than consistent.

[Primarily, [each state\'s **governor** functions as the
**commander-in-chief** of the **National Guard** within their
state]{.mark}]{.underline}. The same applies to U.S. territories and the
District of Columbia. The D.C. National Guard, since it does not have a
governor, reports directly to the POTUS. [This means [National Guard
forces generally follow **state-level leadership**]{.mark} and serve
under the state's adjutant general, a senior military
officer.]{.underline}

The primary responsibilities under state control include responding to
natural disasters, such as hurricanes and wildfires, maintaining public
order during civil unrest, or managing localized emergencies like power
outages.

For example:

The Texas National Guard frequently conducts border control operations.

The California National Guard operates critical missions during wildfire
crises.

Under state control, the operational focus is entirely on protecting the
health, safety, and well-being of that state's citizens.

LANSING, Mich. --- [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Michigan **[[National
Guard]{.underline}]{.mark}** (MING) [[is expanding]{.mark} its
technological capabilities by]{.underline} partnering with a Michigan
based company [focusing on [space **domain**
integration]{.mark}]{.underline} by [[linking **deep space
tech**]{.mark}nology to operational and tactical fires]{.underline}.

"Space is vital to national security and [[this]{.mark} partnership
[demonstrates an **enduring solution**]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
Department of Defense Joint Fires applications [[by integrating]{.mark}
the **[space domain]{.mark}** from joint targeting to battle damage
assessment]{.underline}," said U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Paul Rogers, adjutant
general and director, Department of Michigan Veteran Affairs. "The
technology Orbital Effects offers is near-real time direct downlink of
satellite radar imagery and intelligence data from space to tactical
user within minutes of overflight and demonstrates the rapid integration
of technology prototyping and capability evolution into emerging Joint
All Domain doctrine."

The Michigan Guard and Orbital Effects, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan,
teamed up to jointly advance emerging doctrine and develop associated
tactics, techniques and procedures. The Guard offers the use of their
facilities for Michigan-based defense industrial base companies to
demonstrate and test their technologies.

"The Michigan Guard identified a need to integrate the Space Domain into
the National All Domain Warfighting Center and Orbital Effects
identified a need to develop and test their sensor to tactical end-user
techniques and procedures," said Ryan Farris, co-founder and chief
financial officer, Orbital Effects. "This agreement benefits both
organizations and originated during an industry day held at the 2020
Northern Strike Exercise at Camp Grayling, Michigan."

[[This]{.mark} partnership [serves as a **vehicle**]{.mark}]{.underline}
for MING [[to develop **future partnerships**]{.underline}]{.mark} with
sensor-to-end-users, Army Futures Command, and to be the Army's platform
for space-based joint fires integration and effects delivery.

"Our technology provides a theater level direct tasking and
dissemination service model that enables tactical commanders to
directly/dynamically-task/or re-task an asset as part of an integrated
intelligence plan," said Farris. "This [**[space based radar]{.mark}**
technology [promotes]{.mark} operational and **[tactical
intel]{.mark}**ligence systems as a way [to increase
**effectiveness**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the joint force." Others
agreed the partnership and advanced space technologies serves a bigger
purpose. [[Space-based capabilities are integral to
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Michigan **[[National
Guard]{.underline}]{.mark}** and are an indispensable component of U.S.
military power. One base located in northern Michigan is receiving
first-hand experience with this technology. Camp Grayling, the largest
Army maneuver training center in the reserve component, is a premier,
full-spectrum, four-season joint training center and provides year
round, customer-focused training support and high quality facilities to
enable military commanders and civilian leaders to meet their unit
readiness requirements.

"As a premier, world class Joint Maneuver Training Center, Camp Grayling
is a leader in providing efficient, unparalleled and the highest level
of modern training," said U.S. Army Sgt. Maj. Kent Smith, Camp Grayling,
Michigan National Guard. "This provides an enduring solution for
Department of Defense Joint Fires applications."

"This also integrates space from joint targeting and supports current
and emergent Army modernization priorities and serve as a preferred
option for program testing requirements supporting all-domain warfare to
include Space," said Smith.

"For us, it just means we get to keep having this incredible data," GINA

The JPSS-2 satellite joins two other polar-orbiting satellites in the
National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service. The
satellite is part of the Joint Polar Satellite System, which is a
collaboration of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

The Suomi NPP satellite, launched in October 2011, is the oldest. The
other satellite is NOAA-20, which launched in November 2017.

JPSS-2, which will be renamed NOAA-21, is expected to operate for seven
years.

Having two satellites with staggered lifespans gathering data about all
facets of Earth is a must, not only for redundancy in case one satellite
fails but also for continuous acquisition of climate data. The
satellites all carry the same instruments so the type of data retrieved
is consistent.

Each satellite makes one polar orbit of Earth every 100 minutes.

[[Alaska's **high latitude** means ground stations in the state can

The Homeland Security Operational Analysis Center (HSOAC) at RAND
Corporation, in its Report on the Arctic Capabilities of the U.S. Armed
Forces, reported that the "United States has important arctic capability
and capacity shortfalls."5 This is unsurprising news to anyone familiar
with the Arctic. An important distinction is made in the report's
opening paragraphs, however: ["\[A\] primary **[limitation]{.mark}** for
the United States [is **capacity**]{.mark}, rather than capability, [to
operate in **the Arctic**]{.mark}. In other words, there is no evidence
of other Arctic actors being able to access parts of the Arctic that the
United States fundamentally cannot, based on the inventory of U.S.
capabilities that are either currently available or planned for in the
near term]{.underline}."6 With regard to specific urgent needs, the
study highlighted [six categories for **immediate
consideration**:]{.underline}

• assets with proximity to support response

• **[[multidomain awareness and communications]{.underline}]{.mark}**

• infrastructure for response and logistics

• sufficient cadres of personnel who are trained, current, and
proficient with the skills to operate in this harsh environment

• [[**tactics** and equipment for]{.mark} low-probability, [high-impact
incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}

• [[the ability to **scale presence**]{.underline}]{.mark}.7

In practical terms, this conveys that [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has **insufficient** "polar-capable **assets and
trained personnel** to ensure **enduring presence across the region at
scale**."]{.mark}]{.underline}8 While this is an accurate miliary
assessment, the report's observations are too narrowly focused. A search
within the document reveals that over the course of 104 pages of
otherwise excellent analysis and recommendations, there are no direct
references to the traditional inhabitants of this geographic region, the
Alaska Natives. Neither there is a notable absence of references to any
of the 229 federally recognized Alaska Tribes and their Tribal
governments. Additionally, there is a lack of culturally appropriate
recognition of any of the distinct cultural groups that comprise Alaska
Natives and their more than 20 distinct languages. Words and phrases
including the following are not found within the document: Iñupiat,
Athabascan/Athabaskan, Yup'ik/Central Yup'ik (Cup'ik), nor Unangax̂,
Alutiiq, Tlingit, Haida, Eyak, or Tsimshian. Put in context, this report
fails to acknowledge the enduring presence of 39,000 Alaska Natives who
live across the 147,000 square mile combined landmass of the federally
recognized Iñupiat Community of the Arctic Slope (ICAS) and the newly
formed Yukon-Kuskokwim Regional Tribal Government (YK-RTG)---the very
areas at issue in the RAND study. These two regional tribal governments
alone account for roughly 25 percent of Alaska's land surface, half its
contiguous coastline, and a total of 65 individual federally recognized
tribes.9 Without being pedantic, there is likely no more polar-capable
asset than the Indigenous men and women who have lived and thrived in
the Arctic for millennia. They are climatically native personnel with an
enduring presence that outdates our nation's very existence.

So critical are these communities to our national interests that their
involvement rightly constitutes one of the five guiding principles
undergirding the 2022 US National Strategy for the Arctic Region. This
document directs federal agencies to consult, coordinate, and comanage
operations, activities, and policies in the Arctic with federally
recognized Alaska Tribes and their correlating non-Native communities.
The United States is committed to regular, meaningful, and robust
consultation, coordination, and, as appropriate, co-management with
Alaska Tribes and their communities, their post-Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act (ANCSA) corporations, and their corresponding tribal
organizations---all to ensure inclusion as partners. In effect, this
entails involving them in decision-making processes regarding potential
actions affecting them, not only out of recognition and respect for the
Alaska Native experience and ways of knowing but also because these are
essential to the success of the Arctic strategy. [The United States has
committed to supporting an equitable partnership with **Alaska Natives**
by integrating the coproduction of and **knowledge** into federal
processes while supporting and at times enhancing Tribal
self-determination and opportunities]{.underline}.10

[[One must ask]{.mark}, then, [how the **extraordinary capabilities and
capacities** of **Alaska Natives** could be **completely overlooked** by
a comprehensive study of **US defense gaps** in the
region?]{.mark}]{.underline} It is not unreasonable to presume the
shortcoming falls on American predilection for technological solutions,
industrial efficiencies, and perhaps unrecognized, underlying cultural
biases. It is a problem worth exploring.

[[Today]{.mark}, both [the **Alaska National Guard** and **Alaska State
Defense Force**]{.mark} **(ASDF)** [claim to be the modern
**incarnations** of the original **Alaska Territorial

[formalized and extended in 1947]{.mark} through its incorporation as
two additional scout battalions of the Alaska Army National Guard (AK
ARNG)]{.underline}, one along the western coast and one in the north,
establishing the "Eskimo Scouts" along the Arctic frontier in presumed
perpetuity. Twenty years later, in 1967, Maj Gen C.F. Necrason, the
commander of Alaskan Air Command, testified to the success of the
project: "Federally owned Armory buildings are now centered in all of
the principal villages dotting the north and western coastline of
Alaska. . . . Ships, aircraft, fishermen, both friendly and foreign, are
all under constant surveillance. . . . The eyes and ears of the
Guardsmen are augmented by 37,000 others in the native population along
the coast."12

Finally, [[even if there are energy **security
benefits**]{.underline}]{.mark} from OCS development, [there are ways to
[**internalize** them under **state control**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[A]{.mark} matching [grant]{.mark} from the **federal government** to
the coastal state [equal to the]{.mark} external **energy
[security]{.mark}** [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}---i.e., equal to the
difference between the state\'s marginal cost of not developing and the
social marginal cost of not developing---[should [lead to]{.mark} the
**[optimal]{.mark}** amount of **[leasing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.31

Matching grants can also be used to internalize any possible spillover
benefits, such as environmental benefits, from preserving the OCS. If
citizens of inland states get some benefits from clean beaches and
unobstructed ocean views and coastal states do not account for those
benefits in determining the amount of OCS development, the federal
government could provide a grant to the coastal state equal to the
amount of spillover benefit. Once again, the existence of a spillover
alone is not justification for federal control.

[With respect to the OCS, [such]{.mark} a [policy is]{.mark}, in fact,
**already [in place]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As described in section II
above, [[the **CZMA** provides **grants**]{.mark} to coastal states
[that have an **approved**]{.mark} comprehensive coastal zone
**[management plan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The plan must meet nine
performance standards which deal with protection and management of
natural resources, public beach access, facilities siting, and other
goals. [The **quid pro quo** for allowing states **flexibility** in

concerns**\" and]{.underline} must [**interact** with relevant **federal
agencies**]{.underline}. The Secretary of Commerce may deny program
approval if he or she finds that the state failed to take national
concerns into account. Since 1988, the federal government has provided
grants in a one-to-one ratio with a state\'s contribution to its
program. With perhaps some additional language on the OCS and /or larger
grants, [[the CZMA appears]{.mark} to be [**capable** of
addressing]{.mark} the **[OCS benefit spillover]{.mark}**
problem]{.underline}.32

In conclusion, it appears that [[**state control** over]{.mark} the [OCS
may be **more efficient**]{.mark} than federal control. [States]{.mark}
would [account for **all**]{.mark} **of the [costs]{.mark}** of OCS
preservation]{.underline}, which consist only of the foregone lease
revenues and not any energy security impacts, [[and]{.mark} could be
made to account for all of the [**benefits**, even those that **spill
over**]{.mark} to other jurisdictions]{.underline}. In contrast, the
federal government tends toward uniformity in OCS preservation.
Moreover, because of the current inequity in the distribution of
benefits and costs along with the states\' capabilities of fighting
development through the CZMA, [[federal control is]{.mark} probably
[leading to **less than optimal** development]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, changes in the status quo may be unlikely, especially
federal relinquishment of the OCS in an era of budget deficits.33 How
then do other proposals measure up?

Though [**[few]{.mark}** explicit [barriers **hinder** renewable]{.mark}
energy [**development** in Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline}, the state
currently lacks the regulatory framework and supporting legislation
needed to attract additional investment in the industry at scale.
Attracting private investment to facilitate further development in
renewable energy remains a critical hurdle, as the market stability and
predictability investors require is difficult to achieve if the state
remains relatively silent in regulating the sector. Aligning Alaska's
renewable energy goals with supporting legislation will provide the
public, private, and nonprofit sectors of Alaska, some of which may have
limited technical or financial ability to procure renewables, greater
access to clean energy.

Additional federal and state investments are necessary if Alaska is to
realize significant and achievable clean energy benefits (and get out
from under the heavy burden of fossil fuels) by 2050.

ACTIONS THAT COULD HELP ACCELERATE ALASKA'S TRANSITION TO CLEAN
RENEWABLE ENERGY ARE OUTLINED BELOW.

legislature is not in session, thus [**[ensuring]{.mark}** an

an influx of new federal infrastructure funds.

[[State **Comprehensive Plan**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- Undertake a

[[Alaska has a **long history** of **leadership** in renewable

example, has helped build more than 100 operating projects across Alaska
--- enabling rural communities to reduce their reliance on costly
diesel, and slowing the Railbelt's consumption of Cook Inlet's dwindling
natural gas supplies.

Renewable energy investments build real projects in Alaska, generating
savings for ratepayers and building our energy security. That's why, as
former Republican and Democratic Alaska legislators, we went to bat for
policies and investments that helped develop our state's vast renewable
resources.

[[**State investment** in renewable energy]{.mark} is now
**[bring]{.mark}**ing [in]{.mark} major **federal dollars** thanks to
legislation approved by Congress]{.underline} in 2021 and 2022. The

[from **federal sources**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Federal investments will support a range of energy projects across the
state. There are funds to help electrify port infrastructure in Seward,
upgrade rural power systems, weatherize homes to reduce Alaskans' home
heating bills, and begin long-needed transmission improvements. These
and more projects are described in a recent report, Securing Our Energy
Future: Perspectives from Alaskans on the Importance of Federal Clean
Energy Incentives.

U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski have been working to
ensure previously awarded energy funds are delivered as promised. But
there is a fight ahead. The future of federal clean energy incentives is
at risk in the coming federal budget process. Our congressional
delegation understands the benefits of these federal clean energy
incentives for Alaska --- and they need to know Alaskans are behind
them.

On-bill repayment options require the customer to repay the investment
through a charge on their monthly utility bill as well, but with this

[In reality, [Congress **rarely**]{.mark} has any chance to [opine on
what states]{.mark} propose to [do with foreign governments]{.mark}.
Why? U.S. **[states simply do not submit their arrangements]{.mark} with
foreign powers** to Congress [for approval]{.mark}]{.underline}. 35
Thus, [[Congress **frequently** has **no knowledge** - let alone views
on - what the states might be doing]{.mark} abroad]{.underline}.36 But
make no mistake - [U.S. states have **very active international
agendas**]{.underline}. Since North Carolina Governor Luther Hodges
first led a gubernatorial trade mission to Western Europe in 1959,
[state engagements with foreign governments have **risen
dramatically**]{.underline}. 37 [U.S. states now interact **directly**
with foreign sovereigns and sub-national governments on a **regular
basis**]{.underline}.38

[[These interactions have]{.mark} in turn [produced **hundreds** of
written **agreements** between U.S. states and foreign governmental
entities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finding these agreements poses a
challenge; no centralized or coordinated reporting system exists and
copies are often not made public. Still, the available evidence shows
that in contrast with the limited scope of congressionally approved
foreign compacts (cross-border bridges, fires, and emergencies), these
foreign agreements cut a much broader swath in terms of parties, topics,
and functions.

[Canadian provinces and Mexican states remain among their most frequent
partners, but U.S. states\' foreign agreements include other national
and sub-national governments]{.underline} from the likes of Australia,
China, Israel, Moldova, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United
Kingdom.39 [[They cover an array of topics, including]{.mark}
agriculture, **[climate change]{.mark}**, education, [**energy**,
**environmental cooperation**]{.mark}, family support, **hazardous
waste**, **homeland security**, **investment**, **military
cooperation**, **[pollution]{.mark}**, sister-state relations, tourism,
trade, transportation, and, of course, water issues]{.underline}. In
terms of content, [[foreign agreements perform a variety of functions,
ranging from]{.underline}]{.mark} (a) \"passive\" joint declarations or
statements of common policies; 4 [(b) [agreements to
**cooperate**]{.mark} whether generally, [via an **action
plan**]{.mark}, or through the creation of some institutional
entity;]{.underline}42 [(c) isolated agreements committing to [a
**particular project or activity**]{.mark}]{.underline};43 [[to]{.mark}
(d) **regulatory agreements** [laying out **normative expectations**
for]{.mark} participant [behavior in **particular
areas**]{.mark}.]{.underline}44

[What has **[Congress do]{.mark}ne** in the face of such a regular (and
even robust) U.S. state practice? **Virtually
[nothing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Congressional **[inaction serves as
the operating norm]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some might question if
Congress has done so little because foreign agreements mean little;
i.e., its silence is a function of the agreements\' political
insignificance. But congressional silence holds true even when foreign
agreements implicate significant foreign relations questions or create
organizational structures patterning future U.S. state behavior.

For example, Congress had nothing to say in October 2007 when ten U.S.
states joined ten European nation states, the European Commission, two
Canadian provinces and New Zealand to form an \"International Carbon
Action Partnership\" (ICAP) to promote cap and trade carbon markets to
combat global warming.45 This partnership operates in tension with a
White House (and Congress) uncommitted to such markets and ongoing U.S.
negotiations with many of the same ICAP participants on this very topic.
46 Similarly, notwithstanding its 1968 objection to Canadian
participation, Congress has yet to opine on a December 13, 2005 Great
Lakes Agreement that does include Canadian participation in a Regional
Body advising U.S. states on water diversions. Nor did Congress react to
Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius\'s 2003 agreement with Alimport -
Cuba\'s food trade agency - that reportedly contemplated Cuban purchases
of \$10 million in Kansas agricultural products in return for the Kansas
A government\'s commitment to encourage a change in U.S. policy toward
Cuba.

In sum, looking to Congress for details on its Compact Clause power in
the foreign context proves a nearly fruitless exercise. Congress has
done little to agree to foreign compacts, little to object to them, and
little to even monitor what U.S. states actually do abroad. [[The
**Compact Clause**]{.mark} as it applies to foreign actors [lies
**effectively dormant**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A. The Need for One Voice

[[The **states are incompetent actors** on the **international**]{.mark}
stage [and]{.mark} often act in ways that **[sabotage]{.mark}** those
more fluent in **[foreign affairs]{.mark}**. First, the [states lack the
tools]{.mark}---the **[information]{.mark}**, **[expertise]{.mark}**,
and **[infrastructure]{.mark}**---[to effectively formulate]{.mark} and
pursue foreign [policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, and relatedly,
because state and local actors are ignorant they are prone to offend and
embarrass foreign nations, including valued allies. Third, [their
episodic interventions **[undermine]{.mark}** the [actions of more
competent actors]{.mark}---**[Congress and the president]{.mark}**---
[because they **sow confusion**]{.mark}
**internationally**]{.underline}. Finally, state participation in
foreign affairs contradicts a foundational premise of our national
system, namely that the parts of the union ought not to be able to take
actions that undermine the entire union.16

Our first concern---state incompetence---has a long historical pedigree.
One founder referred to the states as "dumb" and "deaf" in the
international arena due to their inability to communicate with foreign
nations.17 We doubt that such claims rested solely on a supposed lack of
constitutional authority in foreign affairs; rather, we think the claims
also reflected the sense that the states were handicapped on the
international stage. States are no less disadvantaged today. They
continue to lack the capacity to participate in international affairs in
meaningful ways.

[Compare the competencies of federal and state institutions. [**No
state** maintains anything resembling the **State Department**]{.mark}
that might help conduct or manage its foreign affairs]{.underline}. The
closest analogs are a handful of "international trade offices."18 But
these single-issue, tiny offices pale in comparison to the institutional
expertise, experience, and resources of the State Department. Indeed,
the size and expertise of foreign policy personnel in other federal
departments (like the Departments of Commerce, Defense, and Homeland
Security) vastly outstrips the scope and knowledge of these undersized
state trade offices.

Consider California: The Golden State is a regular interloper in foreign
affairs.19 As the world's eighth largest economy as of 2013,20 it has
the resources and, one would suppose, an acute need for extensive
information as a means of fostering foreign trade. Yet if foreign trade
expertise was truly vital, California's resource allocation ill reflects
that need. To date, California has established a trade office in China
and granted it a \$700,000 budget.21 That is its only international
trade office.22 By contrast, the fiscal year 2015 appropriation for the
State Department was just short of \$50 billion.23 Money earmarked for
our nation's spy agencies---the CIA, for example---is classified, but
reputable insiders have indicated the sum nearly equals the State
Department's allocation.24 And this summary omits the massive resources
expended on foreign affairs in the Departments of Defense, Homeland
Security, Commerce, Treasury, and elsewhere.

Even if we were to concede that states somehow gather adequate trade
intelligence through their tiny trade offices, states enact laws with
serious ramifications outside the commercial realm. For instance, few
would suppose that an Idaho trade office could possibly supply the state
with the requisite knowledge necessary to gauge whether the state ought
to aid in Libya's quest for military jets during the el-Qaddafi era. To
have a meaningful opinion on the latter requires knowledge about Libya's
neighbors, their potential reaction, and, of course, Libya's intentions.
Similarly, a trade office cannot generate useful information about how
foreign nations will react to economic sanctions meant to curb human
rights violations, especially when those sanctions attach to companies
that are from nations that have unblemished records. How Germany will
react when its companies are sanctioned by Massachusetts for doing
business in Burma is hardly obvious.

The gulf between the foreign experience and knowledge of the federal
government as compared to the states cannot be overstated. Whatever else
one might say about the sprawling federal bureaucracy, its superior
information and familiarity in foreign affairs is beyond question.25

Our second concern is related to the first. Because the states are
ignorant, they are prone to offend and inflame foreign nations. States
can provoke already hostile or unfriendly regimes, making fraught
relations worse. Recall Rudolph Giuliani's ouster of Yasser Arafat from
the Lincoln Center, a decision that, to us at least, reflects a certain
na¨ıvet´e, namely a failure to appreciate the need to sometimes treat
parties that have American blood on their hands with respect.26 Enemies
can, through time and a convergence of interests, become partners, as
happened with Germany and Japan. States also can embarrass allies,
damaging relationships the federal government has nurtured over time.
For example, dozens of states have denounced the genocide of
Armenians.27 In contrast, the federal government has refused to use that
precise word in order to avoid upsetting Turkey.28 President Obama's
decision to refer to "atrocities" instead of "genocide" in a speech
commemorating the victims reflects longstanding federal policy and a
concern for Turkish sensitivities.29

Or consider the state legislation at the heart of Arizona v. United
States. 30 Arizona made it a crime for unauthorized aliens to work in
the state, and it empowered police to arrest persons who they had
probable cause to believe were in the country illegally.31 The law
prompted Mexico to take the unusual step of filing an amicus brief in
the Supreme Court.32 In that brief, our southern neighbor explained that
the law "caused long-term harm to Mexico-U.S. relations."33 Suggesting
that the federal government agreed with that assessment, an American
diplomat conceded to the Chinese that the Arizona statute was a human
rights debacle.34

Our third [concern arises from the proclivity of states to undermine our
national government's conduct of foreign affairs. When the
**[states]{.mark} adopt their own [foreign policies]{.mark}**, they may
**[sow confusion]{.mark}** in the international arena [as to our
**nation's stances**]{.mark}. This problem can manifest in numerous
ways. The federal government may adopt a foreign policy and assure the
international community of its commitment to it. But **dissenting
states** may act at **cross-purposes** to that federal
policy]{.underline}.

For instance, the United States policy towards Taiwan (the Republic of
China) is a study in nuance and opacity.35 The idea is to say the
minimum that satisfies the People's Republic of China (namely, that
there is one China and that we recognize the People's Republic), while
not wholly abandoning our longtime ally, Taiwan.36 But suppose that
individual states, including California, New York and Texas, decided to
recognize Taiwan and its pretensions to sovereignty over the mainland.37
And imagine further that such states sought to favor Taiwan, adopting
policies that enraged the People's Republic. Can anyone doubt that these
states could hazard our nation's relations with China, leading to heated
rhetoric, trade wars, or---more troubling---real ones?

[[Even when states and the fed]{.mark}eral government [have the **same
general stance**]{.mark} toward some foreign matter, seemingly [**minute
differences** can **generate significant
problems**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider the events leading up to
Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council. 38 In response to Burma's
suppression of dissenters, Massachusetts barred state agencies from
making purchases from almost any company doing business in Burma, a
rather sweeping law.39 Congress subsequently enacted a more restrained
federal response to the suppression, creating some bars on foreign aid
and delegating authority to the president.40 Using that authority, the
president barred U.S. persons from investing in Burma.41

The resultant mess left members of the international community annoyed
and flummoxed. The state law threatened to derail effective multilateral
diplomacy because, by penalizing foreign companies for doing business
with Burma, it effectively punished other nations as well as Burma.42
Many of our allies formally expressed their displeasure---some even
filed complaints with the World Trade Organization alleging that the
state act violated international trade agreements.43 As the European
Union (EU) complained in its Supreme Court amicus brief, the [[state law
"creat\[e]{.mark}d\] [confusion about **which entity speaks
for**]{.mark} **and acts on behalf of [American
interests]{.mark}**."]{.underline}44 Moreover, the EU explained, [[such
laws "greatly **increase the difficulty** of the]{.mark} U.S.
[Government to **speak consistently**]{.mark} and [with **one

C. Federalism as a Tool of Federal "Field Claiming" (or Encroachment)

There also might be a more instrumental story to tell, one in which the
states are relied upon not for some reason related to the traditional
federalism values (as they are to some extent when Congress nationalizes
state experiments or looks to state bureaucracies as partners in federal
statutory entrenchment) but rather one in which the [[**states** are
utilized as]{.mark} more direct [vehicles of **federal**]{.mark}
**regulatory [aggrandizement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Specifically, I
want to highlight the possibility that [[Congress]{.mark} might [design
statutes around **state-based implementation** for the purpose of
**gradual**]{.mark} field [entry]{.mark} into areas traditionally
dominated by state law. A [federal statute that]{.mark} marks new
legislative terrain for the federal government but [relies]{.mark}---at
least [in the beginning]{.mark}---[on]{.mark} the **[states to
implement]{.mark}** it might be a way for the federal government to
"claim the field" as one suitable for federal regulation, but at the
same time [rely on]{.mark} state expertise and [state **political
cover**]{.mark} while the federal government gets up to
speed]{.underline}.

[Statutes like these have **[political benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Most obviously, [they [allow Congress to leave the initial extent of the
**federal role vague**]{.mark}, a strategy that [might make the
intrusion **more acceptable to legislators**]{.mark} who otherwise would
resist these moves]{.underline}. To be sure, the fact that the federal
government offers states the chance to implement new federal statutes
does not diminish the reach of federal legislative authority. But [by
retaining the states in the lead role for implementation, [such
statutes]{.mark} might be [more **politically palatable** to those
who]{.mark} generally resist federal aggrandizement or prefer "smaller"
government or local variation]{.underline}.

[Giving states the lead role in implementation also might assuage
concerns of legislators who [are]{.mark} suspicious of, or
**[politically opposed]{.mark}** to, the current executive branch's
policy agenda]{.underline}. Particularly in times of divided government,
[some members of Congress might trust their home-state counterparts more
than the administrative appointees of the President to fill in the
interstices of new federal programs]{.underline}. Work in the political
science realm has, indeed, documented an increase in such delegations
toward the states and away from the federal government in times of
divided government.105 Others have documented how Southern congressmen
pushed early implementation of federal welfare programs through the
states to preserve the political economy of the region.106 Seen in this
light, varied state implementation---and in particular, allowing for
less aggressive implementation by some states---might, in fact, be a
necessary part of the political deal to get some federal statutes passed
in the first place. That is, the possibility of [**[state-based
dissent]{.mark}** that often is described as a pathology in traditional
federalism theory [may actually be a beneficial **safety valve**
that]{.mark}]{.underline}, on occasion, [[makes]{.mark} new **[federal
legislation possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As I have suggested, [executive federalism grows out of [the **political
polarization of our times**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**Hyperpolarized
parties** gridlock Congress and further empower the executive branch,
but they also [create **strong links across the state-federal
divide**]{.mark}]{.underline}.172 [[These links]{.mark} may
[enable]{.mark} something like party government through state-federal
cooperation among co-partisans, enhancing the ability of the federal
executive and certain states to act. At the same time, the state-federal
connection **amplifies [opportunities for partisan resistance and
contestation]{.mark}**. [If state and federal executives seek each other
out because of **partisan affinity**, their **collaborations** tend also
to bring in other]{.mark} state [actors with **opposing
positions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The most basic way executive federalism has negotiated these distinct
possibilities is by allowing for differentiation within national policy
across states. For instance, waivers under the ACA have fostered
Democratic states' implementation of the Act while permitting departures
from federal statutory provisions in certain Republican states.173
Federal executive deference to state understandings of required
insurance coverage has likewise made the ACA's essential benefits
provision differ across the states.174 Similarly, Colorado, Washington,
Oregon, and Alaska have effectively nullified the federal CSA with
respect to most marijuana offenses within their borders, but the CSA
remains operative in states that continue to criminalize marijuana.175
The EPA's Clean Power Plan is a more deliberately designed
state-differentiated policy.176 The final rule walks back a surprising
form of differentiation found in the proposal---an apparent attempt to
pacify opposition in coal-reliant, Republican jurisdictions---that would
have required the states emitting the most greenhouse gasses to do the
least.177 But the rule continues to furnish different emissions
reduction targets for each state while allowing for state flexibility in
meeting these targets.178

Evidence that the states are influenced by the federal government's
policy agenda is mixed. In the area of social welfare policy recent
research shows little influence (Heidbreder 2008). Welch and Thompson
(1980), however, do find some evidence that states respond to positive
federal incentives in a variety of policy areas. Specifically, states
are stimulated to act faster when provided incentives than when policies
are not so accompanied. Similarly Daley and Garand, using environmental
policies related to hazardous waste, found some modest support for the
hypothesis that "States that receive higher funding for environmental
programs are somewhat more likely...to adopt stringent hazardous waste
regulations that mimic federal Superfund program" (2005, 634-35). They
conclude "signals from the federal government" will prompt states to act
in this policy area (Daley and Garand 2005, 631). Barrilleaux, et al.
(2002), also find that states react to federal activities in the area of
welfare spending. These studies show federal influence on state policies
driven by federal incentives specifically designed to trigger state
action. In their study of anti-smoking policies, Shipan and Volden
(2006) examine three types of diffusion, local-state, state-state, and
national-state and find evidence of national-state pressures resulting
in policy adoptions that do not always rely on federal incentives.
[[**Evidence** the federal government is **taking cues** from the
**states** is]{.mark} also **[mixed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Boekelman
(1992) examined a variety of federal laws for [[state
influences]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[found **limited
effects**]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly in the areas of redistributive
policies such as child care, homeless aid, and welfare reform. Using 5
interviews with federal policy makers, Mossberger (1999) found some
inadvertent state-federal diffusion in the area of enterprise zones.
[Respondents]{.underline} in her study [were aware of trends in state
policy making and Mossberger concludes that any influence from the
states is limited]{.underline} (1999, 49). In their study of vertical
diffusion in the area of health policy, [Weissert and
Scheller]{.underline} (2008) [find some indication of
[influence]{.mark}, but]{.underline} conclude that [the story [is
complicated due to a **lack** of **policy
learning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As they state,
"**[[Federal]{.underline}]{.mark}** health [[officials are]{.mark}
considering and often [adopting **policies**]{.mark} in]{.underline}
health [areas in which state actions have occurred]{.underline}.
[[But]{.mark} the federal actions [show **little recognition** of
**state experiences**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Weissert and Scheller 2008,
S171). Thompson and Burke (2007) examined health policy as well and
found [**modest** evidence of state policies **leading** federal
ones]{.underline}. The recent work by Lowery, et al. (2011), [using [a
**variety** of policy areas]{.mark} from state level bill introductions
[finds **no ev**]{.mark}]{.underline}idence [[of **bottom up
effects**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Our study differs from others on policy
diffusion in the following respects. Most other studies tend to focus on
a single issue such as health care (Weissert and Scheller 2008) or
environmental policy (Daley and Garand 2005) or make no distinctions
among varying policy types (Lowery et al. 2011). Most studies are not
longitudinal. And, most studies concentrate on a single step in the
policymaking process. We consider three policy areas -- education,
economics and health - separately, over a period of 20 years and examine
varying stages of the federal policymaking including congressional
hearings, State of the Union addresses, the passages of public laws.

#### Even [multi-state]{.underline} action wouldn't spillup.

**Chatterji 15** \[Aaron Chatterji (Ph.D. in Business Administration,
University of California, Berkeley), 1-1-2015, "Don't Look to States for
New Ideas," New York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/opinion/dont-look-to-states-for-new-ideas.html,
njn\]

The problem is, just when we need their innovative energies, [the
[states are]{.mark} looking less and [**less likely** to be
fountainheads of **new federal policy**]{.mark}]{.underline} over the
next generation.

What has changed? First, [[**state politics** have become]{.mark} much
more **[partisan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After the 2014 elections, [60
percent of the states are completely controlled by a **single
party**]{.underline}. The power of state policy innovations is that they
traditionally had bipartisan fingerprints, allowing an enterprising
national politician from either party to lay claim to them. In the new
world of single-party states, very little bipartisan legislation will
emerge.

We will see no Democrat willing to adopt the radical tax reforms of Gov.
Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, and surely no Republican could
champion the Safe Act that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, got passed
in New York --- one of the strictest gun control bills in the nation.

Of course, these ideas may diffuse to other like-minded states. But more
likely, [these new [initiatives will be at **one end** of the political
**spectrum**]{.mark} or the other, **[limiting]{.mark}** the potential
for federal [adoption]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Second, it has become clear that ["**[scaling]{.mark}**" successful
state policies [is **harder** than it appears]{.mark}]{.underline},
because of both political forces and policy realities. Every technocrat
in Washington dreams of finding a successful policy at the state level,
an early childhood education program in North Carolina or a creative
prison reform initiative in Texas, and using it as a model for federal
legislation. The logic is that once a state "laboratory" has tested and
approved a particular policy innovation, it will have the same
"treatment" effect in the other 49 states.

But that hasn't been the case. Increasingly, efforts to "federalize"
state innovations have been hobbled by political backlash. The Obama
administration's Race to the Top program used billions of dollars of
prize money to persuade states to adopt several education policy reforms
that had been proven to work around the nation. Part of the package was
Common Core, which, in part because of President Obama's imprimatur, is
now toxic on the right (and, because of opposition from some teachers,
is just as toxic on the left).

Of course, despite their zeal for federalism, many conservatives never
really agreed with Justice Brandeis's nostrum to begin with. They worry
that successful state policies might not translate well to the federal
level, even under ideal conditions --- witness the skepticism with which
Congressional Republicans greeted President Obama's announcement last
week of a new initiative to help students attend community college,
based on a program in Tennessee.

And they have a point: It turns out scaling a successful state program
often ends up with a one-size-fits-all policy that might work well in
Ohio but fall flat in Arizona. An economic development program centered
on promoting entrepreneurship might work in Silicon Valley, Boston or
Austin, Tex., but fail miserably in an area without leading universities
and a highly educated work force.

Moreover, federal mandates, in which Washington sets up rules and the
states run with them, hopefully innovating along the way, have not fared
much better. The Medicaid expansion was intended to be a core pillar of
the Affordable Care Act, but following a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision,
many states chose to opt out.

Finally, all politics aside, while tax revenues have been increasing
recently, [many [states remain **cash-strapped**]{.mark}]{.underline}
since the Great Recession, [[**limiting** their]{.mark} ability to
initiate significant]{.underline} economic or social [[programs]{.mark}
of any kind]{.underline}.

Taken together, these forces mean that while states might experiment
with numerous policies over the coming years, very few will ever go
national. [[For those]{.mark} of us [frustrated with]{.mark} federal
**[gridlock]{.mark}**, the [states]{.mark} will [provide **little
comfort**]{.mark} going forward. [The **50
lab**]{.mark}**oratorie[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} of democracy will
produce many so-called cures, but [**[none]{.mark}** of them [will go
down]{.mark} very **[well]{.mark}** in our nation's
capital]{.underline}.

The ASDF, under the authority of the state governor as an organized
militia, has attempted to provide workarounds to these cultural and
physical obstacles. However, [despite herculean efforts to gain momentum

[is]{.mark} roughly **[240 individuals statewide]{.mark}**, and even
this represents a major increase over recent years]{.underline}. [[The

cost-effective means of **[assur]{.mark}ing** [the United States'
**sovereignty and presence** in Alaska]{.mark}'s remote coastlines and
wilderness]{.underline}. And even were impediments to service reduced or
removed, the injured relationship between the Alaska National Guard and
some Alaska Native Communities might take a generation or more to
repair, under even the best conditions.24 While there are legitimate,
objective reasons the Eskimo Scout Battalions were deactivated from the
AKARNG, some of these affected communities contain families who have
multiple generations of proud military service in their blood. The loss
of the privilege to serve can contribute substantially to a loss of
identity in many ways. It is, in short, a betrayal of those most able to
help the nation in its hour of Arctic need.

Federal Control of the National Guard

Presidential Authority

[While the [National Guard]{.mark} prioritizes its state-level missions,
there are instances where [**control** shifts to the **federal**
level]{.mark}]{.underline}. The President of the United States has the
authority to federalize the National Guard under specific circumstances.
[This shift in control places Guard units under the same organizational
chain of command as the active-duty military, making the **Secretary of
Defense** their immediate overseer]{.underline}.

[Federal control is most commonly exercised:]{.underline}

[[During]{.mark} wartime or [**military deployments** to support
**overseas** missions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

To enforce federal laws when local and state authorities cannot manage
the situation (often requiring congressional approval).

[[When]{.mark} there is a national [emergency]{.mark} that [**exceeds**
the **state\'s capacity**]{.mark} to manage.]{.underline}

[For instance:]{.underline}

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, National Guard forces were
federalized to bolster homeland security efforts.

[Units were deployed internationally to support combat operations during
the wars in **Iraq** and **Afghanistan**.]{.underline}

Federalizing the National Guard dramatically changes its operational
priorities, focusing entirely on national security over state-specific
concerns.

[Who controls the National Guard at the federal level? [The
**president**]{.mark} of the United States [mobilizes the National
Guard]{.mark}, but the secretary of defense then controls
them.]{.underline}

Dual-Status Command

Coordinating State and Federal Roles

[[Sometimes]{.mark}, [control of the National Guard]{.mark} is not
strictly one or the other---it [can involve a **combined**
effort]{.mark}. This arrangement is [referred to as \"**dual-status
command**,\"]{.mark} where a commander is authorized to take orders from
**both** the governor and the president simultaneously]{.underline}.

Dual-status command is particularly useful during large-scale
emergencies that require collaboration between state and federal
resources. A classic example would be hurricane response scenarios,
where National Guard units support Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) initiatives while also addressing state-level needs.

This hybrid model ensures that Guard resources are allocated efficiently
and in real-time without the delays of shifting full authority to one
party.

[Who controls the National Guard on dual-status missions? The state and
federal government.]{.underline}

[Activation Scenarios]{.underline}

To better understand who controls the National Guard when the Guard
transitions between state and federal control, here are three common
scenarios where oversight changes occur.

Scenario 1: Disaster Relief (State-Controlled)

When a tornado devastates a town in Kansas, the governor activates the
state's National Guard to assist with search-and-rescue operations,
deliver food and supplies, and establish temporary shelters. In this
case, the Guard operates solely under state control.

Scenario 2: Civil Unrest (State-Controlled, Occasionally Federalized)

During localized protests in a city, if local law enforcement struggles
to maintain order, the governor might activate the National Guard to
restore peace. However, if the unrest becomes widespread and involves
violation of federal laws, the president may step in to assume federal
control.

Scenario 3: **[Military Deployments (Federalized)]{.underline}**

[[When the U.S. engages in **international operations**, National Guard
troops are often **federalized**]{.mark} and integrated with active-duty
forces. [This was the case with the deployment of Guard units during
Operations **Iraqi Freedom** and **Enduring
Freedom**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Who controls the National Guard upon federal mobilization? The
secretary of defense under the order of the president of the United
States.]{.underline}

[[The **University of Alaska** Fairbanks' Geophysical Institute has
received a \$70 million contract to **continue** serving as a satellite

announced the five-year contract extension this week.

[[The]{.mark} Geophysical Institute's [Alaska Satellite Facility is
one]{.mark} of 12 [site]{.mark}s around the nation [used in **NASA's
Earth Observing System Data and Information
System**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Each of the 12 sites has its own function. The Alaska Satellite
Facility's specialty is the management of data derived through what's
known as synthetic aperture radar. [That technology uses **sensors on
satellites** that produce energy and then record how much energy is
reflected back after interacting with Earth]{.underline}. The resulting
images are used to better understand Earth's systems and can help guide
disaster response.

The Alaska Satellite Facility employs nearly 100 people, according to
the university, and that number is expected to grow when NASA launches a
new satellite next year in partnership with the Indian Space Research
Organisation, that nation's space agency. [[The project]{.mark}, called
NISAR, [will observe Earth's]{.mark} land- and [**ice-covered surfaces**

to gather information on natural hazards, sea ice, groundwater supplies,
carbon exchanges between plants and the atmosphere and other subjects,

[US [oil]{.mark} and gas [companies are **unlikely** to]{.mark} expand

President Donald Trump\'s executive order enabling them to do
so]{.underline}, company officials and industry representatives told
Reuters, [[noting a **future president** could easily **reverse**
Trump\'s move]{.mark}.]{.underline}

US oil production is already at record levels due largely to increased
production in more accessible areas like Texas and New Mexico, and
companies have limited spending on new projects to focus on returning
cash to shareholders.

Analysts said [drillers may **not** be in a **hurry** to take advantage
of Trump\'s order]{.underline} on Monday titled Unleashing Alaska's
extraordinary resource potential.

The executive order would reopen vast areas for drilling and mining, and
expedite permits for projects, part of Trump\'s sweeping plan to
maximize oil and gas production while reversing former President Joe
Biden\'s policies encouraging the transition to renewable energy sources
to \"fight climate change\".

\"[Many of [these areas have been **closed** for a]{.mark} good **[long

president of policy at the American Petroleum Institute]{.underline}, a

Mobil, Chevron Corp, and ConocoPhillips.

\"[There is always the risk that [these]{.mark} areas [could be
**reclosed** after the **next election**]{.mark} cycle]{.underline},\"
he said, adding [[that is the **key issue** that could **temper
interest**]{.mark} from oil companies in the short term [to pursue **new
drilling**]{.mark}]{.underline} projects there.

[[Drilling]{.mark} in the Arctic and Alaska [is a **high-risk**
endeavor, involving **decades**]{.mark} of work [and
**billions**]{.mark} of dollars [of **investment**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Exxon, Chevron, Conoco, and Occidental Petroleum did not comment.

Conoco is among the most active oil companies in Alaska's Arctic, and
secured a federal approval from the Biden administration for its \$8
billion Willow project there in 2023, angering environmental groups.

The US drilling industry trade group AXPC also did not comment.

A source at one major US oil company, who asked not to be named
discussing the matter, said [many [companies]{.mark} are **unlikely** to
pursue projects in Alaska based on Trump\'s executive order alone,
**[seek]{.mark}**ing [**long-term certainty** like an **act of
congress**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Energy consultancy Rystad said [Trump's use of the **[\"drill, baby,
drill\"]{.mark}** mantra in his inauguration speech
[overestimates]{.mark} the industry\'s [**willingness** to prioritize
**growth** over]{.mark} generating shareholder
**[returns]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**Drilling** in Alaska\'s pristine Arctic refuge has long been a
**source of friction**]{.underline} between Alaska lawmakers and tribal
corporations seeking to open more acres to drilling to spur economic

[[The]{.mark} Biden Interior [Department received **no bids**]{.mark}

ANWR's wild landscape lacks roads and public facilities, but its 1.6
million-acre coastal area along the Beaufort Sea is estimated to have up
to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, enough to supply the US for
more than a year and a half at current rates.

Before leaving office this month, Biden banned new offshore oil and gas
drilling in federal waters off the East and West coasts, the eastern
Gulf of Mexico and portions of the northern Bering Sea in Alaska.

The move was considered mostly symbolic since it mainly covered zones
that have no important prospects.

Trump issued an order seeking to repeal those protections.

Still, the energy industry is \"cautiously optimistic\" that the Trump
administration will continue easing regulations that have hampered oil
and gas development, said API\'s Meyers.

\"The administration deserves a lot of credit for at least doing
everything that they can do to send the signal that these areas are
going to be open for development,\" he said.

**CRS 5** \[Congressional Research Service, 5-25-2005, "Federal-State
Maritime Boundary Issues,"
https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL32912.html, njn\]

Over the last few decades, new uses for coastal and offshore areas have
emerged, including aquaculture and renewable energy (wind, wave, and
tidal), while more traditional uses, such as commercial fishing and
[**oil and gas** development on the **O**uter **C**ontinental
**S**helf]{.underline}, have continued to flourish. As technologies
improve, [companies may increasingly seek to move activities farther
offshore]{.underline} and to expand resource development [in both state
and federal waters]{.underline}. Various interests argue over which
policies and regulations will best minimize conflicts between competing
offshore resource users while effectively safeguarding already crowded
coastal areas from further development. [An issue that is
[**fundamental** to]{.mark} the **regulation** of [offshore activities
is]{.mark}]{.underline} determining [which level of government has
**[primary jurisdiction]{.mark}** over particular **offshore
areas**]{.underline}. Who has [**jurisdiction** depends]{.underline}, in
part, [upon the federal-state **maritime boundaries**]{.underline}.
Unlike most countries, [[the]{.mark} U.S. [federal government]{.mark}
**shares jurisdiction** over its 12-mile]{.underline} (nautical)
[territorial sea with its **coastal states**]{.underline}. [The 1953
Submerged Lands Act]{.underline} (SLA) generally [[gives]{.mark} coastal
[states title to]{.mark} the submerged lands, waters, and natural
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline} located [[within **three**]{.mark}
**nautical [miles]{.mark}** [of the coastline]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
waters, seabed, and natural resources [[**beyond** these]{.mark} three
miles [belong to the **federal government**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Identifying where a federal-state maritime boundary lies is not always
an easy task. Federal-state maritime boundaries are represented on
nautical charts published by the National Ocean Service, part of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These charts
reflect the federal government\'s official position on where U.S.
maritime boundaries (federal and state) are located. Determining the
baseline from which federal-state maritime boundaries are determined can
be difficult, depending on the geography of the coast. International
law, which guides U.S. practice, recognizes different methods for
locating a coastal baseline in such circumstances. The U.S. has
traditionally applied a measurement standard that minimizes the extent
of state offshore waters. But while setting maritime boundaries is
primarily a federal prerogative, states have continued to challenge the
National Ocean Service charts. When a U.S. coastal state disagrees with
the federal government\'s position on its maritime boundary, the courts
have been called upon to resolve the dispute, often the U.S. Supreme
Court under its original jurisdiction under article III of the
Constitution. Congress also may become more involved in maritime
boundary and jurisdiction issues as the pace of offshore development
increases, and legislation to address some of these issues, such as S.
735 , has been introduced in the 109th Congress. This report will be
updated as circumstances warrant.

Chukchi Sea Outer Continental Shelf Planning Area that the U.S.
government utilizes to inform its offshore oil and gas
leasing]{.underline} program. The Chukchi Sea remains withdrawn from oil
and gas leasing. Some of the formations lie within the United States
extended continental shelf as identified by the U.S. Department of
State. This region is remote, ice-covered for much of each year, and far
from infrastructure.

No petroleum exploration wells have been drilled in the North Chukchi
Basin. [[The **nearest** wells lie **20**]{.mark} **to 100
[miles]{.mark}** to the [southeast]{.mark} on the U.S. Chukchi Sea

the basin was interpreted from two-dimensional seismic reflection data
tied to those wells and correlated throughout the basin. The number and
sizes of potential oil and gas accumulations were inferred from seismic
amplitude anomalies observed in the seismic reflection data. Such
observations commonly are used as reliable indicators of hydrocarbon
accumulations in the Alaska North Slope.

worked 12 hours per day on duty, and 12 hours per day on standby. The
worker was paid above California and federal minimum wages for his time
on duty, but was not paid for his standby time. The issue was whether
the California laws, which provided more protection and higher wages

As a 50-year member and leader of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1547, a union representing over 4,000
workers in Alaska, I know firsthand that [it takes diverse sources of
energy, including renewables, to keep]{.underline} electricity and
heating prices affordable and [the electrical grid
resilient]{.underline}. Certain [[**federal** tax credits make
**renewable** energy]{.mark} projects more
**[economical]{.mark}**]{.underline} to build [[and]{.mark} right now
[we **need**]{.mark}]{.underline} Sen. Murkowski's help in restoring
[tax **credits** and other [renewable]{.mark} energy [**provisions**
that were eliminated by the]{.mark} U.S. **[House]{.mark}**]{.underline}
of Representatives.

Trained IBEW professionals help build Alaska's major infrastructure
projects like oil and gas lines, electrical generation plants,
transmission line upgrades and electrical grid interties. In addition,
we build and maintain wind turbines, solar arrays, hydroelectric dams,
and other renewable energy sources that keep power more affordable for
all while providing good-paying careers for Alaskans. As of 2024,
[[decades of **federal investment**]{.mark} have [resulted in]{.mark}
approximately [30% of]{.mark} Alaska's total **[energy]{.mark}
generation** [coming from **renewable** sources]{.mark}. This is slated
to **increase** as our **transmission** lines are
**upgraded**]{.underline} and more renewable energy projects are
completed. However, [[the]{.mark} recently passed [House]{.mark} budget
**[reconciliation]{.mark}** bill basically [**repeals** tax credits that
**support**]{.mark} future **[renewable energy]{.mark}**]{.underline}
investments, and puts important projects and these jobs at risk.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski has always supported Alaska's energy development,
including renewable projects, and we applaud her for that. Most
recently, on April 9, she joined three other Republican Senators in a
letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune in support of the renewable
energy tax credits that have brought direct benefits to so many parts of
the country.

"While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to
streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of
current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the
American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader," they
wrote in their letter.

Sen. Murkowski is correct in her public statements that
[[renewable]{.mark} energy [**tax credits** are key for developers to
invest]{.mark} in large-scale projects]{.underline} such as data
centers, electrical grid modernization and others. [**[Federal]{.mark}**
tax [credits]{.mark} help [**defray** the **prohibitive cost**]{.mark}
on the front end of the projects]{.underline} when it matters most.
[[Without that money]{.mark}, [renewable projects]{.mark}]{.underline}
that already have workers trained and ready to build [[will be
**delayed**]{.mark} for **[years]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Continuing to invest in American-made renewable energy production is the
only way we can meet increasing energy demand and avoid skyrocketing
energy bills for everybody.

Congressional Research Service "Constitutional Limits on States' Power
over Foreign Affairs" https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB10808
accessed 7.7.2025 // ***mosuQ***\]

[[The Constitution gives the federal government the **primary power** to
manage]{.mark} the United States' [foreign relations]{.mark}. Article I,
Section 10 prohibits states from engaging in a set of activities that
implicate international affairs]{.underline}, while the Supremacy
Clause, Foreign Commerce Clause, and other constitutional provisions
place key elements of this power with the federal government.
Interpreting these provisions, [[the Supreme Court]{.mark} has
[described]{.mark} the United States' [foreign affairs power]{.mark} not
only [as]{.mark} superior to the states but [residing **exclusively in
the national government**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With respect to foreign
relations, the Supreme Court said that "state lines disappear" and the
"purpose of the State \... does not exist."]{.underline}

Despite this sweeping language, states and other subnational entities
(e.g., cities and counties) play a more prominent role in international
relations than may be generally recognized. States have offices overseas
and send trade and diplomatic delegations to foreign countries. They
have imposed economic sanctions for human rights abuses and military
aggression---most recently on Russia for invading Ukraine. States
regularly enter into written pacts with foreign governments on issues
ranging from trade to the environment to tourism. Some of these
international pacts address potentially sensitive subjects, such as
border security with Mexico and technology transfers with the People's
Republic of China (PRC). A recent rise in pacts with PRC-based bodies
led U.S. intelligence officials to warn state and local governments
about PRC efforts to exploit its relationships with subnational
governments to promote its geopolitical interests in the United States.

The Supreme Court has held that the Constitution constrains states'
ability to act on the global stage, but much of the state-driven
international activity is not publicized or presented to Congress.
Because Congress may have an interest in optimizing and overseeing
states' actions in this area, this Sidebar discusses constitutional
limits on states' role in international affairs and potential avenues
for congressional involvement.

Article I, Section 10

**[Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution]{.underline}** contains a
catalog of prohibitions and limitations on states' power. Many of these
restrictions relate to foreign relations. In particular, [[Clause 1
**prohibits**]{.mark} the [states from entering into any "Treaty,
Alliance, or Confederation." Clause 3]{.mark}---commonly called the
**Compact Clause**---[requires Congress to approve]{.mark} any [state's
"Agreement]{.mark} or Compact" [with a]{.mark} "foreign Power," i.e., a
[foreign government]{.mark}.]{.underline} (The Compact Clause also
governs interstate agreements and compacts, discussed in this Sidebar).
Whereas Clause 1 categorically prohibits every treaty, alliance, and
confederation, the Compact Clause conditionally allows states to make
agreements and compacts, provided Congress consents. These clauses
create a clearly bifurcated structure, yet the founding documents do
little to explain how to distinguish between the treaties banned by
Clause 1 versus the agreements and compacts that may be approved under
the Compact Clause.

The Founders apparently believed the distinctions were self-explanatory,
but that is no longer the case. In The Federalist No. 44, James Madison
wrote that the "particulars" of Article I, § 10 "are either so obvious,
or have been so fully developed, that they may be passed over without
remark." Despite Madison's confidence, the meaning of these terms of art
were "lost" within a generation, according to the Supreme Court. Jurists
and scholars have debated several theories of how to distinguish Clause
1's treaties from the Compact Clause's agreements and compacts, but no
authoritative approach has emerged. Other than stating that the Civil
War Confederacy violated Clause 1, the Supreme Court has provided little
guidance on what constitutes a treaty, alliance, or confederation. By
contrast, the Supreme Court has developed a body of jurisprudence
interpreting the Compact Clause, which may inform the constitutional
limits on states' power to make commitments to foreign governments.

Holmes v. Jennison

Several Justices concluded in an 1840 case that the Compact Clause
covers every agreement between state and foreign governments regardless
of the agreement's form or content. In Holmes v. Jennison, the governor
of Vermont ordered a resident of Quebec (then part of Great Britain)
arrested and returned to Quebec to stand trial for murder even though
the United States did not have an extradition treaty with Britain at the
time. A crucial legal issue---whether the Supreme Court had
jurisdiction---turned on whether the governor of Vermont had arrested
the fugitive under an informal "agreement" with Canadian authorities
within the meaning of the Compact Clause. The case ultimately ended with
an equally divided court, but four Justices found that the governor made
an agreement that should have been submitted to Congress for consent.
This four-Justice opinion, written by Chief Justice Taney, was based on
a literal interpretation of the Compact Clause that would require
congressional approval for "every agreement, written or verbal, formal
or informal, positive or implied, by the mutual understanding of the
parties."

Although not a majority opinion, Chief Justice Taney's reasoning has
been influential, and the Supreme Court cited it positively in later
cases. At the same time, historical practice does not support the view
that all agreements between states and foreign governments require
Congress's consent. Scholars have shown that states rarely seek
congressional approval for pacts with foreign governments. Moreover, in
the context of interstate compacts, the Supreme Court developed a new
line of cases that more narrowly interpreted the congressional consent
requirement than Chief Justice Taney's Jennison opinion.

Applying Interstate Compact Cases

Beginning with Virginia v. Tennessee in 1893, the Supreme Court declined
to adopt Chief Justice Taney's literal reading of the Compact Clause.
Instead, the Court used a functional interpretation that limited the
congressional consent requirement. Under Virginia and later interstate
compact cases, only interstate compacts that have the potential to
increase states' political power at the expense of federal sovereignty
require congressional consent. In a 1985 case, the Supreme Court stated
that only state commitments that have certain "classic indicia of a
compact" require congressional approval.

The Supreme Court has not said whether this interstate compact
jurisprudence applies to states' international compacts. Some observers
argue that the two types of compacts raise different concerns and should
not share the same standard. The greater weight of authority, however,
suggests that the Court's interstate compact cases apply in both
scenarios. Several courts and the executive branch have applied
Virginia's functional test to states' engagement with foreign
governments. For example, a federal district court in 2020 applied
Virginia and its progeny in rejecting a Compact Clause challenge to a
California carbon cap-and-trade agreement with Quebec. Thus, under the
current state of the law, only a select set of state agreements with
foreign powers that satisfy the Supreme Court's interstate compact
jurisprudence require congressional consent.

Supremacy Clause Preemption

[Apart from the limitations in Article I, Section 10, [the federal
government's **preemption power**]{.mark} may **[limit states' role in
foreign affairs]{.mark}**. Under the Supremacy Clause, federal statutes
and self-executing international agreements preempt (i.e., render
unenforceable) conflicting state laws]{.underline}. As discussed in this
CRS report, federal law can expressly preempt state law---or it can
impliedly do so---when the preemptive intent can be inferred from the
federal law's structure and purpose. These preemption principles can
invalidate state statutes that undermine the federal government's
diplomatic and foreign policy goals.

In Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, the Court addressed whether
federal law sanctioning Burma preempted a Massachusetts law that
restricted state agencies' ability to contract with companies doing
business with Burma. Although the laws shared similar foreign policy
objectives of addressing human rights issues in Burma, the Supreme Court
held that the Massachusetts law frustrated federal aims by using
stronger economic restrictions and not providing the President the same
waiver authority as the federal statute. The Crosby court reasoned that
because the President could not waive the Massachusetts restrictions
even if Burma yielded to the full slate of the United States' demands in
its diplomatic negotiations, the state law undermined the United States'
ability to present a unified negotiating position. As a result, the
Court held that federal law preempted the Massachusetts statute.

[[Preemption]{.mark} can [also apply when state law **undermines** the
United States' foreign policy]{.mark} expressed in its treaties and
executive agreements]{.underline}. In American Insurance Association v.
Garamendi, the Supreme Court struck down a California law that required
in-state insurers to disclose information about Nazi-era life insurance
policies. In the late 1990s, survivors of the Holocaust and their heirs
filed a large number of lawsuits in U.S. courts seeking to recover the
value of insurance policies held in Germany that were never collected
because of Nazi persecution and policies in the 1930s and 1940s. The
California law was part of a broader effort to allow Holocaust survivors
and their heirs to make claims related to those Nazi-era policies in
California courts. The United States and Germany, by contrast, believed
those claims were best resolved outside of litigation. The two countries
concluded an international agreement designed to allow Nazi-era
insurance claims to be heard before an international claims commission.
Because the California law frustrated the United States' objectives, the
Garamendi Court held it was preempted.
