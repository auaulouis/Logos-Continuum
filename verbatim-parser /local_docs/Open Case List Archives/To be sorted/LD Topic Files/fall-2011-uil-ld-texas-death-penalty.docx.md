## Aff: International Law

### Texas system violates international law

Nicole Allan, Associate editor Atlantic, July 6 2011, In Texas, a Death
Penalty Showdown With International Law,
[http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/07/in-texas-a-death-penalty-showdown-with-international-law/241480/]{.underline}

Humberto Leal Garcia, Jr. is a Mexican citizen who was sentenced to
death by a Texas jury in 1994 for rape and murder. **[Texas provided
Garcia with court-appointed lawyers, but at no point during his arrest
or trial did the state inform him of his right to contact the Mexican
consulate, which could have provided him legal aid. This right is
guaranteed by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, signed by the
U.S., Mexico, and 171 other nations. In its treatment of Garcia, Texas
was in violation of international law.]{.underline}** Whether or not
Garcia\'s sentencing would have been different with the help of Mexican
lawyers, **[Texas\'s decision puts the U.S. in a difficult position
abroad \-- many worry that, if we do not respect the consular rights of
foreign nationals, other countries will have less incentive to respect
those of our citizens.]{.underline}**

### Texas system thwarts international law

Nicole Allan, Associate editor Atlantic, July 6 2011, In Texas, a Death
Penalty Showdown With International Law,
[http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/07/in-texas-a-death-penalty-showdown-with-international-law/241480/]{.underline}

**[Texas\'s commitment to its sentencing, meanwhile, signals the
fundamental distaste many Americans seem to feel for international
governance]{.underline}**. Last year\'s Tea Party wave ushered in a
series of state legislature attempts to ban the application of foreign
legal codes and international mandates in U.S. courts. Though most of
these measures did not pass, they provided a rallying point in many
conservative circles. As Governor Perry contemplates a run for the
Republican presidential nomination, a high-profile rejection of the
international community and the Obama administration may be one of his
most powerful assets. **[The Garcia case has also revealed an
uncomfortable truth about international law \-- while often influential,
its scope is fundamentally limited, especially in the U.S. When the ICJ
directly instructed Texas to change its policies, the state refused, and
the Supreme Court sided with Texas over its international
cousin]{.underline}**. In principle, even-handed arbitration of
international disputes sounds reasonable. But, in practice, geopolitics
\-- and, sometimes, domestic politics \-- win the day. **[After all, the
U.S. has so far been able to brush aside the Vienna Convention without
sacrificing its own interests.]{.underline}**

[http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/07/in-texas-a-death-penalty-showdown-with-international-law/241480/]{.underline}

**[With Texas barreling toward another execution on Thursday, Congress
will not be able to intervene in time for Garcia]{.underline}**. Last
Friday, the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court to stay the
execution until Congress had time to vote on legislation that would
require states to comply with the Vienna Convention, thus obligating
Texas to reevaluate Garcia\'s case. **[Solicitor General Donald
Verrilli, Jr. stressed the diplomatic implications of the execution \--
that compliance with international treaties helps the U.S. protect its
citizens abroad and advance its foreign policy interests. Backtracking
on a major global agreement, some worry, could puncture U.S. integrity
in future international negotiations, potentially making other countries
less willing to sign onto treaties they fear the U.S. may not
honor.]{.underline}**

## Aff: Death Row Is Inhumane

### Death row conditions are inhumane

Dave Mann, Texas Observer, November 10, 2010, Solitary Men,
[[http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/solitary-men]{.underline}](http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/solitary-men)

IMAGINE **[SPENDING 23 HOURS A DAY IN A CEMENT ENCLOSURE the size of a
bathroom]{.underline}**. Now imagine **[sitting in that small room
nearly all day, every day without respite, for a year, five years, even
10 years]{.underline}**. How long before you become restless and lonely?
How long before you start pacing and talking to yourself? **[How long
before you lose your mind? For more than 300 inmates on Texas\' death
row, these aren't hypothetical questions. Their lives are confined to
60-square-foot cells in which they languish 23 hours a day, alone in a
featureless room, behind a solid steel door, cut off not only from what
they call "the free world," but from nearly everyone. Inmates endure
this isolation an average of 10 years]{.underline}**---though some
**[have been on death row more than 30---until their appeals are
exhausted and their sentences are commuted or carried out. Or until
they're killed by disease, old age or another inmate. Or until they kill
themselves.]{.underline}**

### Texas death row conditions are the worst in the country

Dave Mann, Texas Observer, November 10, 2010, Solitary Men,
[[http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/solitary-men]{.underline}](http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/solitary-men)

**[Texas has perhaps the harshest death row conditions in the country.
Most states keep death row prisoners in permanent solitary confinement.
But Texas]{.underline}** is one of two states---Oklahoma is the
other---that **[doesn't allow death row inmates to watch
television]{.underline}**, according to a survey by the Northwestern
University Law School. Eleven states permit contact visits with death
row prisoners**[. In Texas, contact visits are never
allowed.]{.underline}**

### These conditions are torture

Dave Mann, Texas Observer, November 10, 2010, Solitary Men,
[[http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/solitary-men]{.underline}](http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/solitary-men)

Death row isn't designed to be pleasant. These are dangerous men. It's
still a maximum-security prison. But **[a growing body of research
suggests this kind of extreme isolation amounts to
torture.]{.underline}**

**[Prolonged isolation can ravage the psyche---causing or exacerbating
mental illness]{.underline}**. A 2003 study of the isolation unit at
California's Pelican Bay prison by Craig Haney, a psychologist at the
University of California-Santa Cruz, reports that **[two-thirds of
inmates in solitary confinement talk to themselves and nearly half
suffered from "perception disorders, hallucinations, or suicidal
thoughts]{.underline}**." Research by Stuart Grassian, a Boston
psychologist who has interviewed hundreds of prisoners, found that about
**[one-third of inmates in solitary confinement develop severe mental
illness. These same effects have cropped up in military prisons. Of all
the U.S. "enhanced interrogation" techniques utilized on detainees in
Iraq and Afghanistan, the most devastating were psychological; prolonged
isolation and blaring music eroded prisoners' sanity.]{.underline}**

## Aff: Death Row Conditions Unbearable

### Texas death row conditions cause mental anguish and disorders 

Dave Mann, Texas Observer, November 10, 2010, Solitary Men,
[[http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/solitary-men]{.underline}](http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/solitary-men)

**[Anecdotal evidence suggests quite a few death row inmates in Texas
suffer from mental illness. Two of the five longest-serving
inmates]{.underline}**---each has been on death row more than 30
years---**[are suffering from documented mental disorders. The number of
suicides on death row has increased since Texas placed inmates in
solitary confinement]{.underline}**. **[Since 2004, five inmates have
killed themselves on death row]{.underline}**---more suicides than in
the previous 25 years (from 1974 to 1999, four death row inmates
committed suicide, according to agency figures). **[While suicides are
still unusual, solitary confinement wears down nearly all
inmates.]{.underline}** Rob Owen, who directs the Capital Punishment
Clinic at the University of Texas Law School, has represented many
inmates on death row. When he visits clients, he can see the effects of
prolonged isolation. "They have to warm up," he says. "At first, they're
withdrawn and quiet, and I think that's because of the isolation."

### Death row inmates subject to extreme isolation

Chris McGreal, The Guardian, November 15, 2009, Texas death row man
claims inmates\' numbered days are form of torture
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/15/texas-death-row-danielle-simpson>

\"**[We spend 22 or 23 out of 24 hours in a cell that\'s very small. We
don\'t have no TVs. We\'re the only death row that don\'t have TVs or
work programmes]{.underline}** or religious stuff. They don\'t let us
have none of that here,\" said Simpson. \"The cells are broken. Whenever
it rains, leaks come through window seals or cracks up in the ceiling.
It messes up legal work, clothes, commissary. Once it gets damp, that\'s
it. They know about it but they don\'t want to come out and fix it.\"
**[Death row prisoners have regularly gone on hunger strike over bad
food, over sleep deprivation because of the unending noise created by
living inside a network of steel cages, and over the alleged brutality
of guards, including the regular use of pepper spray. Hardest of all is
the interminable solitary confinement. There is no physical contact with
other prisoners]{.underline}**, although Simpson can communicate with
them by shouting.

claims inmates\' numbered days are form of torture
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/15/texas-death-row-danielle-simpson>

Intentional or not, some **[lawyers for the condemned say they have
watched the mental state of their clients deteriorate sharply on death
row. Some inmates withdraw completely, refusing to shower or leave their
cells for recreation. Others fight back with court appeals and by
writing to supporters with angry and bitter accounts of imprisonment and
what they often characterise as the injustice of their situation. They
are trying to save their lives, not only through a mostly futile effort
to overturn a death sentence but by staying sane through the years of
isolation]{.underline}**.

## Aff: Death Penalty Racist 

### African Americans are much more likely to be executed in Texas

Allan Turner, Houston Chronicle, May 1, 2008, Study implies racism
affects death penalty in Harris Co.
[[http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Study-implies-racism-affects-death-penalty-in-1769251.php]{.underline}](http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Study-implies-racism-affects-death-penalty-in-1769251.php)

**[A new study on how race affects the way death penalty cases are
handled in Harris County, the so-called \"capital of capital
punishment,\" finds that black offenders are more likely than whites to
be placed on trial for their lives, even when their crimes are
relatively less heinous]{.underline}**. In the study, to be published in
the fall issue of Houston Law Journal, University of Denver sociology
professor Scott Phillips concludes that **[black defendants are 1.75
times more likely to face the death penalty at trial and 1.49 times more
likely to be sentenced to die]{.underline}**. Phillips also found that
prosecutors were less likely to seek the death penalty in
capital-eligible cases in which the victims were black.

### This disparity ensures inequality

Allan Turner, Houston Chronicle, May 1, 2008, Study implies racism
affects death penalty in Harris Co.
[[http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Study-implies-racism-affects-death-penalty-in-1769251.php]{.underline}](http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Study-implies-racism-affects-death-penalty-in-1769251.php)

A closer examination of the cases, Phillips said, showed that **[while
blacks and whites were subject to capital prosecution at about the same
rate, blacks in many cases had committed less heinous
crimes]{.underline}**.

**[Statistics showed they were less likely to have committed murders
involving burglary, kidnapping or rape, committed murder by beating,
stabbing or asphyxiating, or murdered victims who were vulnerable due to
age or murdered women. \"The bar appears to have been set lower for
pursuing death against black offenders,]{.underline}**\" Phillips wrote.
\" \... **[To impose equal punishment against unequal crimes is to
impose unequal punishment.\"]{.underline}**

### Race is most important factor in death penalty process

Gloria Rubac, May 10, 2007, Racism, resistance and the death penalty
[[http://www.workers.org/2007/us/death-penalty-0517/]{.underline}](http://www.workers.org/2007/us/death-penalty-0517/)

**[The one factor that most determines whether a defendant will be
sentenced to death is the race of the person killed]{.underline}**.
**[Even though Black and white people are murdered in nearly equal
numbers, 80 percent of people executed since the death penalty was
reinstated in 1976 had cases involving white victims.]{.underline}**Only
14 white people have ever been executed for the murder of a Black
person, while 215 Black people have been executed for killing whites.
Conversely, white women represent only 0.8 percent of murder
victims---yet 35 percent of those executed since 1976 were sentenced to
die for killing a white woman. **[The over-all picture of capital
punishment shows nationality involved at every turn. If a white person
is murdered, whether the defendants are Black or white, they are at
least five times more likely to be given the death penalty than if a
Black person is murdered. African Americans are the least likely to
serve on capital juries but the most likely to be condemned to die. In
Texas, racism in the criminal justice system was openly practiced until
recently]{.underline}**. Defense attorneys in Dallas remember that until
the mid-1980s **[so-called Black-on-Black murders were known around the
courthouse as "misdemeanor murder.]{.underline}**" Attorney Fred Tinsley
reported in 2000, "At one point, with a Black-on-Black murder, you could
get it dismissed if the defendant would just pay funeral expenses."

## Aff: Death Penalty Does Not Deter Crime

### Studies indicating deterrent effect of death penalty are flawed

Lives? A New Debate,

**[The studies have been the subject of sharp criticism, much of it from
legal scholars who say that the theories of economists do not apply to
the violent world of crime]{.underline}** and punishment. Critics of the
studies say **[they are based on faulty premises, insufficient data and
flawed methodologies. The death penalty "is applied so rarely that the
number of homicides it can plausibly have caused or deterred cannot
reliably be disentangled from the large year-to-year changes in the
homicide rate caused by other factors,"]{.underline}** John J. Donohue
III, a law professor at Yale with a doctorate in economics, and Justin
Wolfers, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in the
Stanford Law Review in 2005. "**[The existing evidence for deterrence,"
they concluded, "is surprisingly fragile]{.underline}**." Gary Becker,
who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1992 and has followed the
debate, said the current empirical evidence was "certainly not decisive"
because "we just don't get enough variation to be confident we have
isolated a deterrent effect."

### Deterrence studies are inaccurate 

Jeffrey Fagan, Professor Columbia Law School, January 21, 2005
DETERRENCE AND THE DEATH PENALTY: A CRITICAL REVIEW OF NEW EVIDENCE.
<http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/FaganTestimony.pdf>

**[The mistake in the enterprise of deterrence research is the attempt
to make causal inferences from a very flawed and limited set of
observational data]{.underline}**. One cannot treat these data as an
experiment, where all the competing influences are ruled out by randomly
assigning states to specific conditions. **[Murder is a complex and
multiply determined phenomenon, with cyclical patterns for over 40 years
of distinct periods of increase and decline]{.underline}** that are not
unlike epidemics of contagious diseases. **[There is no reliable,
scientifically sound evidence that execution can exert an effect that
either acts separately and sufficiently powerfully to overwhelm these
consistent and recurring epidemic patterns. This body of work, based on
infrequent capital punishment, its geographical spread across a large
nation with little publicity, and the omission of numerous competing but
untested explanation of homicide changes, fails to provide a reliable
much less a dispositive test of deterrence of murder. To accept it
uncritically invites errors that have the most severe human
costs.]{.underline}**

### **Deterrence is false**

Deterrence Myth: No Solid Evidence That Killing Stops The Killing
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cassy-stubbs/the-death-penalty-deterre_b_52622.html>

Among the many factors in the debate about the death penalty is whether
capital punishment deters violent crime. Although **[solid research
indicates that there is no valid evidence of such
deterrence]{.underline}**, recent attention has been given to a few
flawed studies concluding that the death penalty does deter murder. **[A
June 10 Associated Press article pointed to statistical studies that
claimed to directly link numbers of executions with numbers of murders
prevented]{.underline}**, including a 2003 study from the University of
Colorado at Denver and studies from 2003 and 2006 by researchers at
Emory University. But **[follow-up studies by top social scientists
soundly reject those conclusions as well as the flawed methodology used
to reach them]{.underline}**. Jeffrey Fagan, a professor at Columbia Law
School and an expert on statistics, testified to Congress that **[the
Emory and Denver studies were \"fraught with numerous technical and
conceptual errors,\" and \"fail\[ed\] to reach the demanding standards
of social science]{.underline}**.\"

animals suffer no pain when they are euthanized]{.underline}**.
**[Animal euthanasia laws provide strict certification requirements for
euthanasia technicians and regulate acceptable methods of intravenous
euthanasia]{.underline}** down to the correct dosage per kilogram of an
animal's body weight. **[By contrast, the Texas legislature has failed
to enact any legislation to ensure that the individuals responsible for
extinguishing human life are properly trained and qualified, and that
the drugs they administer are both effective and humane]{.underline}**.
Instead, the legislature has left the lethal injection protocol to the
discretion of the director of the Correctional Institutions Division of
the TDCJ -- a prison official with no medical training**[. In Texas, men
and women are put to death not under the supervision of doctors and
anesthesiologists---or even licensed veterinarians---but at the hands of
a prison lethal injection team whose medical training is limited. It is

more strictly than the execution of human beings.]{.underline}**

Only a licensed veterinarian may administer the drugs, the dosage is

**[In]{.underline}** states such as **[Texas]{.underline}**, **[the
three-drug lethal injection protocol is administered by staff who are
not trained anesthesiologists.]{.underline}** Moreover, Texas law fails
to set forth dosage-to-weight guidelines for the administration of
anesthesia, and does not require effective measures to ensure prisoners
are anesthetized at the moment of death. **[These circumstances give
rise to a real risk that the anesthesia will fail to produce
unconsciousness at the time the second and third drugs are administered.
The second drug]{.underline}** in the three-drug protocol is pancuronium
bromide**[, a paralytic that causes asphyxiation, which is both painful
and terrifying to a conscious person. The nature of the paralysis
induced by pancuronium bromide means that members of a lethal injection
drug team with limited medical training will find it almost impossible
to know if the anesthesia is working]{.underline}**. TDCJ procedures
allow drug team members to proceed immediately with the administration
of potassium chloride "if the condemned individual exhibits no visible
sign of being awake," a test that makes little sense if the individual
is paralyzed and unable to move or even blink. Worse, **[the paralytic
effects of the pancuronium bromide would mask the suffering felt by a
conscious prisoner during the administration of the final drug in the
protocol, potassium chloride, which causes cardiac arrest and is
excruciatingly painful when injected intravenously.]{.underline}**

**[The pain and suffering that an inmate would experience if not
properly anesthetized is extreme]{.underline}**. Because pancuronium is
a paralytic that restricts the ability of the respiratory muscles to
contract, it causes asphyxiation. The third drug, **[potassium chloride,
causes excruciating pain that has been likened to the feeling of having
one's veins set on fire.]{.underline}** **[Experts who have testified in
lethal injection cases have unanimously agreed that it would be
unconscionable to inject either drug into a person who was not
anesthetized.]{.underline}**

### Lethal injection is torture

Human Rights Watch, April 2006, So Long as They Die
<http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/us0406webwcover.pdf>

Although supporters of lethal injection believe the prisoner dies
painlessly, **[there is mounting evidence that prisoners may have
experienced excruciating pain during their executions. This should not
be surprising given that corrections agencies have not taken the steps
necessary to ensure a painless execution. They use a sequence of drugs
and a method of administration that were created with minimal expertise
and little deliberation]{.underline}** three decades ago, and that were
then adopted unquestioningly by state officials with no medical or
scientific background. Little has changed since then. As a result,
**[prisoners in the United States are executed by means that the
American Veterinary Medical Association regards as too cruel to use on
dogs and cats.]{.underline}**

**[Under the Texas execution protocol, the members of the execution team
receive little training]{.underline}**. Before new team members can
participate in executions "without the direct supervision of existing
team members," they have to "follow\[\] the drug team through at least
two executions" and participate in "at least two executions under the
direct supervision of existing team members." T**[he lack of rigorous
training requirements for members of the execution team, who are not
required by law to have any prior experience in the administration of
anesthesia, is remarkable when contrasted with the strict provisions
governing the training of technicians and veterinarians involved in
animal euthanasia. In short, men and women may die at the hands of an
executioner who lacks the training and experience to minimize suffering
or even determine if the anesthesia is working.]{.underline}**

The Texas legislature's hands-off approach to the taking of human life
stands in marked contrast to its proactive approach to the taking of
animal life. **[Texas statutes subject the animal euthanasia process to
rigorous oversight, regulation, and training requirements in order to
make the procedures more humane. Condemned human beings in the state
must rely on a procedure implemented by bureaucratic fiat to safeguard
their rights and prevent needless pain and suffering during the
execution process]{.underline}**. In sum, **[the manner in which Texas
carries out the execution of human beings is riskier, less transparent,
and has less oversight than the euthanasia of cats, dogs, birds, and
lizards]{.underline}**. We call on the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles, Governor Rick Perry, and the courts to stay pending executions
until the legislature enacts measures that provide at least the same
protections to human beings condemned to die as are provided to sick or
unwanted animals. At the same time, the Texas legislature and judiciary
should require TDCJ to subject its lethal injection protocol to public
scrutiny and expert assessment to ensure that executions are carried out
in such a way as to minimize human suffering.

This **[lack of transparency exacerbates concerns regarding the source

Administration states that it "does not review or approve products for
the purpose of lethal injection," and that it will not review shipments

clamor for executions by processing capital cases in assembly-line
fashion with little or no regard for the fairness and integrity of the
process]{.underline}**. In doing so, **[it has shown the need for full
habeas corpus review by inde-pendent, life-tenured federal
judges]{.underline}**. However, the once "Great Writ" of habeas corpus
barely survives the restrictions put on it by the Supreme Court and
Congress. As a result, **[those most in need of the protection of the

grant habeas corpus relief, finding that "sleeping counsel is the
equivalent to no counsel at all." **[In another case, after the Texas

appointed lawyers who were incapable of preparing petitions and filing

lawyers by denying them relief]{.underline}** over dissents that
characterized the court's review as a "farce," "travesty," and
"charade," and "border\[ing\] on barbarism." In one case, a **[federal

egregious violations of the right to counsel and other constitutional
protections ignored by state courts, **[the Supreme Court has erected
numerous barriers to federal habeas corpus review. The Court has also
adopted a standard for the effectiveness of counsel that some courts
construe as guaranteeing nothing more than a warm body with a bar card

restricted habeas corpus review eve more in the Antiterrorism and

mockery, and a disgrace to the legal system and the legal
profession]{.underline}**. **[The Texas judiciary, responding to the
perceived will of the state's voters, instead of protecting rights, is
not only ignoring constitutional violations, as so many elected judges
must do in order to stay in office. It is actively engaged in denying
rights to people by providing them grossly inadequate legal
representation]{.underline}**. **[An accused may stand virtually
defenseless facing the death penalty as his lawyer naps at a trial that

**[Texas does not have a public defender system for indigent defendants,

experience in capital murder defenses]{.underline}** or appeals. Newton
notes that **[incompetent defenses in capital murder cases are legion in
Texas, and that, even in a death penalty appeal, bad lawyering is hard
to prove]{.underline}**. One decision, which turned down a defendant\'s
habeas appeal due to bad lawyering, concluded that **[\"\[t\]he
Constitution does not say that the lawyer has to be awake\" during trial
proceedings.]{.underline}** Furthermore, Texas was not obliged to
provide lawyers free of charge to post-conviction habeas appeals until
September 1, 1995, and the amount the state is willing to pay lawyers
for these appeals is sufficiently low that most defendants still do not
receive counsel for their appeals.

Ned Walpin, PBS Frontline, 2000, Why is Texas #1 in Executions?

re-election]{.underline}**. Also, there are many indications that
**[elected appellate judges generally are of a lesser quality than their
appointed counterparts in other states.]{.underline}** Newton even
claims that **[these elected judges do not carefully consider the
complexities of each specific death penalty case]{.underline}**. As
evidence, Newton argues that \"\[e\]specially during the past few
years\...**[the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has refused to publish
most of its decisions in death penalty cases, including many cases that
discuss important issues of first impression. Often these opinions take
positions entirely inconsistent with prior decisions by the court and
fail to mention the conflict. Generally speaking, there is a
hit-and-mostly-miss quality in the Court of Criminal Appeals\' death
penalty decisions. Only a few judges during the past decade have been
capable of or willing to write thoughtful, scholarly decisions, whether
granting or denying relief.\"]{.underline}** Additionally, Newton notes
that these judges tend to dismiss habeas corpus appeals even in cases
where there appears to be glaring unanswered questions about the
defendant\'s guilt.

## Aff: Death Penalty Racist

### Death penalty applied overwhelmingly against African Americans

David Dow, Professor University of Houston Law, NY Times July 31, 2011,
David Dow: Death Penalty, Still Racist and Arbitrary

Nationwide, blacks and whites are victims of homicide in roughly equal
numbers, yet 80 percent of those executed had murdered white people.
Over the past three decades, the Baldus study has been replicated in
about a dozen other jurisdictions, and they all reflect the same basic
racial bias. By insisting on direct evidence of racial discrimination,
the court in McCleskey essentially made the fact of pervasive racism
legally irrelevant, because prosecutors rarely write e-mails announcing
they are seeking death in a given case because the murderer was black
(or because the victim was white). In Texas, though, they do come close.
In 2008, the district attorney of Harris County, Chuck Rosenthal,
resigned after news emerged that he had sent and received racist
e-mails. His office had sought the death penalty in 25 cases; his
successor has sought it in 7. Of the total 32 cases, 29 involve a
nonwhite defendant. Since 1976, Texas has carried out 470 executions
(well more than a third of the national total of 1,257). You can count
on one hand the number of those executions that involved a white
murderer and a black victim and you do not need to use your thumb, ring
finger, index finger or pinkie.

Gloria Sasser, League of Women Voters Texas, 2002, Facts & Issues
CRIMINAL JUSTICE: Capital Punishment
<http://www.lwvtexas.org/pdf_files/IS_CapPun.pdf>

**[The law adopted a "unitary" appeals process that requires the direct
appeal and state habeas corpus proceedings to take place concurrently
and shortens the time period for seeking habeas relief]{.underline}**.
**[A convicted person is generally limited to only one application of
habeas corpus.]{.underline}** At the conclusion of the simultaneous
processes, the death-row inmate **[has access to only limited federal
relief. James C. Harrington and Anne Moore Burnham argue, "Although the
habeas corpus process prior to the enactment of Article 11.071 was long
and tedious, it allowed persons who were wrongly convicted and sentenced
to death sufficient time to acquire the evidence needed to prove their
innocence." The new concurrent process shortens that time frame, and, as
a result, may promote the execution of some innocent
persons]{.underline}**. In addition, **[the new procedure effectively
precludes the convicted person from raising standard points of reversal
of appeal during the habeas process, including ineffectiveness of
counsel, a violation of a constitutional right, or other error, rising
during the direct appeal]{.underline}**.

### Lawyers are unqualified

Human Rights Watch, March 2001, "The Miscarriage of Justice: Mental
Retardation and Capital Trials

It is well documented that **[many capital defendants receive inadequate
counsel, often because courts appoint attorneys for the indigent who are
too inexperienced, overworked, or uninterested to do an effective job.
As a result, numerous death penalty cases are marred by serious
errors]{.underline}**: a recent comprehensive examination of thousands
of death penalty cases during the past three decades, undertaken by
Columbia University professors at the request of the chair of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, found that **[appeals courts identified
prejudicial, reversible errors in sixtyeight percent of all capital
cases they reviewed. Aside from deliberate police or prosecutorial
misconduct]{.underline}** (e.g., withholding exculpatory evidence),
**[the most common cause of serious error in capital cases is
"egregiously incompetent" defense lawyers. Similarly, the Dallas Morning
News reported that of 461 death row inmates in Texas, fully one quarter
had been represented by attorneys who had been reprimanded, placed on
probation, suspended, or disbarred by the Texas Bar
Association]{.underline}**.

<http://www.lwvtexas.org/pdf_files/IS_CapPun.pdf>

**[Since 1973, seven Texas death row inmates have been released from
prison due to wrongful conviction]{.underline}**. In addition to
inadequate representation, **[studies have identified several other
causes of wrongful convictions in death penalty cases, including faulty
expert testimony, questionable forensic testimony, and reliance on
eyewitnesses, uncorroborated co-defendants, and testimony from fellow
criminals and others who can benefit from assisting the
prosecution]{.underline}**. Prosecutors and defense lawyers often rely
on physical evidence such as hair and blood samples, ballistics, bite
marks, shoeprints, fingerprints, and DNA testing. Out-dated technology,
untrained technicians, and under-funded laboratories can lead to faulty
test results. The qualifications and effectiveness of the persons
presenting the evidence in court can vary greatly. Eyewitnesses to
crimes may have faulty vision or memory (or both). Yet, reliance on a
single eyewitness may be the only ground for conviction even in capital
trials. **[The testimony of codefendants and others who can benefit from
assisting the prosecution is suspect because of possible conflicts of
interest]{.underline}**.

### Innocent persons are likely to be executed

capital punishment to become Texas history
<http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/The-death-penalty-It-s-time-for-capital-1692445.php>

**[The death penalty in Texas is fraught with demonstrable
error,]{.underline}** and the people of the state seem more willing to
deal with that fact than their leaders. Events of the past year have
convinced us that **[defendants have been executed on the basis of
invalid evidence. They may or may not have been guilty, but the fact
that we have convicted people based on faulty evidence leads inexorably
to a horrible likelihood --- that we have executed innocent people. The
high number of death row prisoners eventually exonerated makes a strong
case that other innocent but less fortunate prisoners have been
wrongfully put to death.]{.underline}** We don\'t lose sleep over the
execution of guilty murderers. But **[the possible or probable execution
of the innocent should trouble every Texan.]{.underline}**

### Life without parole is only way to prevent innocent persons from being killed

capital punishment to become Texas history
<http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/The-death-penalty-It-s-time-for-capital-1692445.php>

The **[accumulating evidence indicates that the current application of
the death penalty in Texas involves an unacceptably high risk of killing
innocent people]{.underline}**. Yet even as the evidence of false
convictions and wrongful executions piles up, only the participants at
the base of the Texas criminal justice system, jury members, seem to be
waking up to the reality of this evil. **[Some opponents have called for
a moratorium on executions in Texas until new, unspecified safeguards
are in place to protect the innocent. Yet it\'s difficult to imagine a
fail-safe route to execution. Besides, we already have the ultimate
safeguard on the books: the sentence of life without parole. Spending
the rest of one\'s days in prison is as terrifying a deterrent to most
people as quick execution. By ending state-sanctioned killing, in the
future when a jury makes a mistake, resurrection won\'t be required to
remedy it.]{.underline}**

## Aff: Innocent Persons Sentenced

### Innocent persons will be executed

Texas Civil Rights Project, September 2000, THE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS
Due Process and Equal Justice . . . or Rush to Execution?
<http://www.texasmoratorium.org/rgraphics/DeathPenaltyReport.pdf>

**[The possibility of executing an innocent person]{.underline}**,
described by Illinois Governor George Ryan as "the ultimate nightmare,"
**[is an alarmingly likely prospect in Texas. Even with the best of
intentions, the criminal justice system makes errors. Poor
representation, prosecutorial misconduct, racial bias, and even simple
mistakes lead to erroneous convictions. And with record numbers of
inmates filling death rows and severe restrictions placed on the
appellate process, there is a real possibility that the mechanisms meant
to catch erroneous convictions will break down even
further]{.underline}**. Following conviction, death row inmates face an
uphill battle in convincing any tribunal that they are innocent. **[Once
an execution occurs, the error is final.]{.underline}**

### Lack of due process ensures innocent persons will be executed

Texas Civil Rights Project, September 2000, THE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS
Due Process and Equal Justice . . . or Rush to Execution?
<http://www.texasmoratorium.org/rgraphics/DeathPenaltyReport.pdf>

And **[there is reason to believe that the crisis of wrongful death
penalty convictions has worsened]{.underline}**. The Death Penalty
Information Center reports that **[the annual average of innocent people
released from death row has increased in recent year.]{.underline}**
Between 1973 and October 1993, there was an average of 2.5 convicted
persons released. Since then, the average has increased to 4.8
individuals released per year, almost twice the previous pace. Moreover,
**[while the number of prisoners on death row is increasing,
opportunities to appeal and to raise newly discovered evidence of
innocence have decreased dramatically, leading to a greater likelihood
of mistakes. Nothing exists to show that Texas is in any better
situation than the rest of the country. In Texas, the facts are as
startling]{.underline}**. Prior to 1995, for example, the Court of
Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal appellate court, reversed
about one-third of death punishments. **[Since 1995, the court and laws
have become much more restrictive, and the court has only granted eight
new trials out of 278 capital punishment convictions (3%) \-- one of the
lowest rates in the country. This underlines rather starkly the quantum
of error that exists in Texas death penalty procedures, which is
especially alarming, given ever shrinking due process protections for
death penalty defendants.]{.underline}**

### High numbers on death row guarantees innocent people executed

Texas Civil Rights Project, September 2000, THE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS
Due Process and Equal Justice . . . or Rush to Execution?
<http://www.texasmoratorium.org/rgraphics/DeathPenaltyReport.pdf>

A 1993 report by the United States Congress House Subcommittee on Civil
and Constitutional Rights, stated that "**[the most conclusive evidence
that innocent people are condemned to death under modern death
sentencing procedures comes from the surprisingly large number of people
whose convictions have been overturned and who have been freed from
death row]{.underline}**" (emphasis added). Since reinstating the death
penalty, **[86 death row inmates have been exonerated in the United
States. That amounts to one death row inmate freed for every seven who
have been executed. Since 1972, seven innocent people have been set free
from Texas death row.]{.underline}**

## Aff: Inadequate Representation

### Lack of funding for counsel of indigent persons on death row

Texas Civil Rights Project, September 2000, THE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS
Due Process and Equal Justice . . . or Rush to Execution?
<http://www.texasmoratorium.org/rgraphics/DeathPenaltyReport.pdf>

**[Competent attorneys shy away from taking appointments because they
are too poorly compensated bythe county, and often lose considerable
money and business when they do take appointments. Appointments to
criminal cases pay less than other legal work]{.underline}**. Pervasive
underfunding by counties is a principal reason for the poor quality of
legal representation. **[Not only is payment problematic at the trial
level where the counties pay court-appointed attorneys, but so too at
the appeals and habeas corpus levels]{.underline}** where the Court of
Criminal Appeals reimburses counties for attorneys for post-conviction
appellate and habeas corpus work, up to \$25,000. A committee of the
State Bar of Texas estimated that defending a post-conviction capital
client requires between 400 and 900 hours of work. b However, the Court
of Criminal Appeals, with a reimbursement cap of \$25,000, essentially
limits state-funded compensation to 150 hours. **[If attorneys put in
the amount of time actually needed to sufficiently represent their
clients, they would earn less than the standard hourly rate for
lawyers]{.underline}** (and, even in some cases that involve intense
development, they could be making minimum wage), which means they would
not earn enough to support their office operations and staff. **[In
serving as court-appointed counsel at any level of the capital
punishment process, defense attorneys actually work at a deficit from
their usual pay schedule]{.underline}**. In private practice, these
attorneys command a fee that incorporates the costs of running their
offices. Thus, when they receive inadequate compensation to defend a
capital case, they are losing money and are unable to meet the financial
demands of office infrastructure.

### Further obstacles exist for defense counsel in these cases

Texas Civil Rights Project, September 2000, THE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS
Due Process and Equal Justice . . . or Rush to Execution?
<http://www.texasmoratorium.org/rgraphics/DeathPenaltyReport.pdf>

**[Apart from the lack of adequate compensation for appointed attorneys,
their work is further hindered by the deficient resources afforded them
by the courts]{.underline}**. To properly defend their cases, **[defense
lawyers often must employ investigators, forensic specialists, mental
health experts, or other experts.]{.underline}** The District Attorney
offices do not have difficulties in obtaining such services. **[The
defense]{.underline}**, on the other hand, **[must request these
services from the court and rely on judicial discretion in granting
them. In fact, the defense must anticipate which services the lawyer
needs to use and then request advance payment from the trial judge. This
procedure]{.underline}**, which necessarily involves communicating to
the judge the defense strategy and what testimony will be utilized,
**[puts the defense in a Catch-22. In essence, the defense must convince
the judge that the money will be well spent.]{.underline}**

### Unqualified counsel results in injustice

Texas Civil Rights Project, September 2000, THE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS
Due Process and Equal Justice . . . or Rush to Execution?
<http://www.texasmoratorium.org/rgraphics/DeathPenaltyReport.pdf>

**[Defense inadequacy is a primary reason why the American Bar
Association (ABA) called for moratorium on executions]{.underline}** in
1997. In July 2000, the incoming president of the ABA, Martha Burnett,
urged a moratorium on the federal death penalty as well: \"**[No
defendant should be executed until we assure that the imposition of the
ultimate sanction is not a result of inadequate counsel or lack of due
process. We cannot ignore that there is unfairness in the way the death
penalty is imposed in this country.]{.underline}**

## Aff: Process Unjust

### Counsel are often incompetent 

Texas Civil Rights Project, September 2000, THE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS
Due Process and Equal Justice . . . or Rush to Execution?
<http://www.texasmoratorium.org/rgraphics/DeathPenaltyReport.pdf>

**[The third highly problematic area regarding appointed counsel is the
general overall level of competency. All too often, the courts appoint
defense counsel with dubious credentials to serve as the last chance for
a person facing death]{.underline}**. The examples of incompetent
defense are never-ending, and alarming. Frederico Martínez-Macías, as
but one example, spent nine years on death row in Texas and was two days
away from execution before a pro bono attorney in Washington, D.C.,
succeeded in convincing a court that he had investigated and rebutted
the state\'s evidence. **[A court-appointed attorney represented
Martínez-Macías at trial. He did not call witnesses, including an alibi
witness who directly disputed the state\'s evidence]{.underline}**. In
ordering a new trial, the U. S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which
oversees Texas, noted that **[his court-appointed attorney effectively
had been paid \$11.84/hour by the state, and \"the justice system got
only what it paid for.\" 14 Texas leads the way in court-appointment
failures]{.underline}**. Under Governor George W. Bush, **[about one
third (43) of 131 people recently executed were represented at trial or
on initial appeal by an attorney who was later disbarred, suspended, or
otherwise sanctioned.]{.underline}**

### Unchecked prosecutorial discretion allows injustice

Texas Civil Rights Project, September 2000, THE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS
Due Process and Equal Justice . . . or Rush to Execution?
<http://www.texasmoratorium.org/rgraphics/DeathPenaltyReport.pdf>

**[The district attorney has unrestricted discretion as to for whom to
seek the death penalty]{.underline}**. **[The prosecutor has unchecked
discretion whether to charge a person with capital murder or not. The
question becomes whether the ability of an accused person to hire a
respected, competent attorney has an impact on the prosecutor's decision
to seek the death penalty, and, of course, whether more subtle issues of
poverty and racism enter into the picture.]{.underline}**

### Prosecutorial elections results in injustice

Texas Civil Rights Project, September 2000, THE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS
Due Process and Equal Justice . . . or Rush to Execution?
<http://www.texasmoratorium.org/rgraphics/DeathPenaltyReport.pdf>

**[Prosecutors in Texas are charged with seeking justice, not
convictions. This command is not as simple as it sounds]{.underline}**.
In Texas, as in the rest of the country, **[state district attorneys are
elected positions. Texas district attorneys, like Texas judges, campaign
vigorously on "tough on crime" platforms]{.underline}**. Prosecutors
typically show they are tough on crime through convictions: \"**[The
drive to win is fueled by a variety of factors, including \... pleasing
the public.\" In Texas, the prosecutor's ability to win is also
bolstered by a skewed balance of power in the courtroom where elected
judges also need to look tough on crime and where a poor defendant has
to face off against all the resources that a district attorney can
muster to win the case]{.underline}**. **[Prosecutorial abuse in Texas
is not infrequent, and when discovered, is often reported in the media
-although the abuse does not always lead to a reversal of the
conviction]{.underline}**. It has led to cases like Randall Adams', who
served 12 years in prison, part of the time on death row, before being
exonerated and set free. The prosecutor who "won" the case against Adams
had never lost a case. To "win" against Adams, however, the district
attorney failed to turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense and
supported perjury among other indiscretions. But he himself was never
disciplined, despite the harm he caused to Adams and the miscarriage of
justice he perpetrated.

## Aff: Legal Process is Biased

### Jury selection process makes convictions more likely

Texas Civil Rights Project, September 2000, THE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS
Due Process and Equal Justice . . . or Rush to Execution?
<http://www.texasmoratorium.org/rgraphics/DeathPenaltyReport.pdf>

During **[the jury selection process in Texas, a juror who expresses
\"conscientious scruples in regard to the infliction of the punishment
of death" or "bias or prejudice" against the death penalty is
disqualified from jury service for cause]{.underline}**. **[It is
through this process that jurors become \"death
qualified]{.underline}**.\" Unfortunately for the defendant, studies
demonstrate, and common sense teaches, that a \"death qualified\" jury
is more likely to convict. **[Not only does this process inhibit the
composition of a fair and impartial jury that represents a crosssection
of the community, as commanded by the Texas Constitution,]{.underline}**
**[but it may also serve as a vehicle for racial bias or to exclude
minorities from juries when a defendant is a minority person, as happens
about 50% of the time in Texas capital punishment trials]{.underline}**.

### Unreliable evidence risks innocent people being convicted

James C. McKinley, NY Times, December 6, 2010, Legal Challenge to the
Death Penalty Begins in Texas

**[Texas has executed 464 people for murder in the last three decades,
more than any other state]{.underline}**, and the death penalty has
widespread support here. But **[in at least 12 cases since 1973, people
on death row in Texas have been exonerated]{.underline}**. In addition,
**[questions have been raised about the convictions of two men already
executed for their crimes]{.underline}** --- Cameron Todd Willingham and
Claude Jones. Mr. Willingham was put to death in 2004 after being
convicted of burning down his home in Corsicana in 1991, killing his
three children. His guilt is now in question as arson experts have found
fault in the evidence against him. Mr. Jones was executed in 2000 for
the 1989 killing of a liquor store owner near Point Blank. After his
death, a DNA test showed that a hair that had linked him to the crime
scene did not belong to him. Both cases are expected to be raised during
the hearing. Richard C. Dieter, the director of the Death Penalty
Information Center in Washington, was the first witness. He said that
since 1973, at least 138 people sentenced to death had been later
exonerated. **["There certainly is a risk of executing the innocent and
that risk still exists today," he said.]{.underline}**

### Death penalty is unjust

Matthew Robinson, Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Criminology,
2011, Vol: 3()2) Is Capital Punishment Just? Assessing the Death Penalty
Using Justice Theory

With regard to virtue-based theorists, recall that the most important
question is whether capital punishment respects and promotes our values,
our moral goodness, and whether it is the right thing to do. These are
questions that are difficult to answer given the wide variety of values,
morality, and sense of "right" among citizens. Yet, given that the death
penalty fails to comport with libertarianism, egalitarianism, and
utilitarianism, it would be hard to argue that capital punishment
satisfies any virtue-based theory. That is, it would be hard to
convincingly argue that capital punishment is valuable or moral or right
when it fails to respect liberty, when it so unequally applied, and when
it imposes more costs than benefits and thus fails to increase overall
utility or happiness in society.

## Aff: No Deterrence

### Studies showing deterrent effect are flawed

John Holdridge and Cassandra Stubbs, Huffington Post, January 8, 2008,
Debunking the Death Penalty Deterrence Myth

**[Economist and law professor John Donohue of Yale University, together
with economist Justin Wolfers of the University of Pennsylvania,
conducted an exhaustive analysis of the datasets used by several
deterrence proponents. They reported that]{.underline}**, while the
evidence pointed more strongly to an increase in homicides following
executions, \"**[there exists profound uncertainty\" about capital
punishment\'s deterrent or anti-deterrent effect because of the enormous
disparity between the number of homicides and the number of
executions]{.underline}**. **[Numerous other studies by distinguished
social scientists have reached essentially the same
conclusion]{.underline}** \-- that, like an election poll that samples
too few voters, the limited available data render any conclusions
meaningless. For example, Jeffrey Fagan of Columbia University, along
with other experts, examined the data and found that each execution may
save 10 lives \-- plus or minus 14 lives. **[In other words, executions
may result in deterrence, no deterrence or more homicides \-- not
exactly a confidence-inspiring result]{.underline}**.

### Small sample size makes drawing conclusions on deterrence impossible

John Holdridge and Cassandra Stubbs, Huffington Post, January 8, 2008,
Debunking the Death Penalty Deterrence Myth

Moreover, **[the small number of executions makes any conclusions about
their influence on homicide rates highly vulnerable to slight changes in
the statistical models used]{.underline}**. In one of many examples in
their analysis, Donohue and Wolfers looked at a deterrence study that
had attempted to account for a number of factors that might have
influenced execution and homicide rates, including the effect of
\"partisan influence.\" **[This study had concluded that each execution
decreases homicides by 18. When Donohue and Wolfers used a slightly
different method to account for partisan influence, they found that each
execution increases homicides by 18; when they dropped the factor
altogether, they found that each execution adds over 50
homicides.]{.underline}**

### Other explanations exist for a decrease in homicides 

John Holdridge and Cassandra Stubbs, Huffington Post, January 8, 2008,
Debunking the Death Penalty Deterrence Myth

**[The first glaring problem is the studies\' failure to consider
alternate explanations for declining murder rates in recent
years]{.underline}**. The possible **[alternatives
include]{.underline}**, among other things: **[the increase of life
sentences without release, the improved police \"clearance\" rates for
felonies, and the waning of acute drug epidemics such as the crack
problem of the early 1990s. Any study that doesn\'t take into account
these obvious factors can\'t be taken seriously.]{.underline}**

## **[Aff: Death Row Inhumane]{.underline}**

### Death row conditions are inhumane

Skinner, who once filed a lawsuit against TDCJ over death row
conditions, said problems with prison staff dramatically have improved.
But **[isolation remains a critical problem. \"That\'s especially a
problem with inmates who can\'t read or write,\" he said. \"They end up
just sitting in their cells. \... A lot of times, when stimuli are
reduced, you start to focus minutely on every little thing. You start to
lose association]{.underline}**. Have you ever known someone you\'d call
\'scatterbrained\'? Well, that\'s what it is like. You\'re in a fog. You
start to think the walls are closing in on you.\" **[Leslie Dupuy, a
mental health official with the University of Texas Medical Branch\'s
inmate-care section, said mental health workers have 250 \"clinical
encounters\" with death row inmates each month. Currently, 65 male death
row prisoners receive ongoing mental health services.]{.underline}**

### Death row conditions cause severe mental and physical harm

Pippin\'s protest came weeks after **[a January Amnesty International
letter to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice alleged that death
row conditions violate international human rights agreements.
Specifically, the London-based group took issue with policies that keep
killers isolated in small cells for as long as 23 hours a day and with
bans on television viewing, work programs]{.underline}**, group
recreation and religious services. **[Such]{.underline}**
**[\"inherently inhumane\" treatment]{.underline}**, Amnesty\'s Susan
Lee complained to TDCJ director Brad Livingston, **[can cause severe
physical and mental harm.]{.underline}**

### Conditions are inhumane 

Renee Feltz, KPFT News, November 8, 2002, Cruel and Unusual? Texas death
row conditions <http://kpft.igc.org/news/110802story3.html>

**[Beyond the expected misery of death row, when prisoners find
themselves on routine lockdowns their freedom of movement is even more
restricted]{.underline}**. Media spokeswoman for the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice, Michelle Lyons: **[\"For death row it doesn\'t realy
matter because death row inmates are in the cells for the majority of
the day anyway]{.underline}**. But they complain because, again, they
don\'t get the hot meals, they get their sandwiches. **[During that time
they are not allowed to leave their cells as often]{.underline}**, but
we have to do it because you know obviously during a month\'s time, it
makes them accumulate contraband. Whether it should be illegal things
that they shouldn\'t have in their cells such as tobacco products, or if
its contraband in the way that they have more in their cell that
they\'re supposed to. You know, **[they\'re limited in the amount of
property they\'re allowed to have in their cell.\" In letters to family
members from loved ones on death row, complaints have surfaced that
items purchased at the prison commissary have been confiscated as
well]{.underline}** - including previously bought food that an inmate
might eat during a lockdown when meals are limited**[. Other
restrictions inmates have been subjected to include limitations on the
amount of belongings they are allowed to keep in their
cell]{.underline}**.

## Legal Process is Just

### Texas system ensures just representation of defendants in capital cases

Richard Roper, United States Attorney Northern District of Texas, Fall
2008, THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE INTERSECTION OF REALITY AND JUSTICE,
Texas Tech Law Review, 41 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 15

First, **[the bar should ensure not only that outstanding appellate
counsel are available to assist defendants on death row, but also that
excellent trial counsel are appointed to represent those charged with
capital offenses.]{.underline}** **[The State Bar of Texas has addressed
this issue by promulgating Guidelines and Standards for Texas Capital
Counsel]{.underline}**. These **[guidelines provide guidance on the
minimum qualifications of defense counsel]{.underline}** and detail the
composition, nature, and function of a capital-offense defense team,
including the necessity for two attorneys, an experienced investigator,
and a mitigation specialist. **[Texas also requires that capital defense
counsel be selected by the presiding judge and that the lead counsel
have at least five years experience in criminal law]{.underline}**. In
addition, **[federal law sets standards to ensure that experienced
capital counsel represent defendants and have available the necessary
investigative, expert, and other services as is "reasonably
necessary."]{.underline}** From my experience in the greater Fort Worth,
Texas area, both state and federal judges have appointed outstanding
criminal defense attorneys with superior statewide and national
reputations to represent defendants charged with capital offenses.

### Legal reforms have eliminated injustice in Texas death row

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

**[Recent reforms in]{.underline}** the leading death penalty state of
**[Texas]{.underline}** will serve to illustrate the point. In 1995,
Texas created **[local selection committees to handle appointment of
counsel in capital cases and set a variety of competence standards for
capital defense attorneys. As part of the continuing effort to monitor
defense counsel in capital cases, in 2001, Texas established a Task
Force on Indigent Defense to develop further standards and policies for
the appointment of defense counsel]{.underline}**.

### Claims of unfairness are outdated

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

**[The evidence of inadequacy of counsel suffers another serious
flaw---it is grossly outdated. It is striking how many of the examples
are more than 10 and even 20 years old.]{.underline}** **[Perhaps such
timeworn anecdotes would be instructive if attorney appointment
procedures had remained the same. They have not. In recent years, nearly
all of the states authorizing capital punishment have created specific
competency standards for appointed counsel. Most of those standards
exceed the exacting qualifications that Congress required for
appointment of counsel in federal case.]{.underline}**

## Death Penalty Deters Future Crimes

### Life without parole does not stop guilty from killing

Richard Roper, United States Attorney Northern District of Texas, Fall
2008, THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE INTERSECTION OF REALITY AND JUSTICE,
Texas Tech Law Review, 41 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 15

Or perhaps it is **[those inmates confined in prison that still conspire
to kill those on the outside]{.underline}**. Take **[Clarence Allen, who
after being sentenced to life without parole for burglary and murder,
orchestrated a triple-murder and a conspiracy to murder seven
people]{.underline}**, all in an effort to silence the witnesses who
testified in his original trial. **[Or consider Julius Robinson, who
while in jail awaiting a capital-murder trial for the depraved and
senseless murders of three individuals, ordered three of his accomplices
to kill a potential government witness. These prison murders, escapes,
and retaliation murders illustrate the difficulty in segregating and
controlling all of the violent offenders who will kill even with limited
resources. Because they have little to lose, the control of an inmate
serving life without parole is a formidable challenge. Life without
parole is simply no panacea.]{.underline}**

### Texas death penalty saves lives

**[As many as 60 people may be alive today in Texas because two dozen
convicted killers were executed last year in the nation\'s most active
capital punishment state]{.underline}**, according to a study of death
penalty deterrence by researchers from Sam Houston State University and
Duke University. **[A review of executions and homicides in Texas by
criminologist Raymond Teske at Sam Houston in Huntsville and Duke
sociologists Kenneth Land and Hui Zheng concludes a monthly decline of
between 0.5 to 2.5 homicides in Texas follows each execution. \"Evidence
exists of modest, short-term reductions in the numbers of homicides in
Texas in the month of or after executions]{.underline}**,\" the study
published in a recent issue of Criminology, a journal of the American
Society of Criminology, said.

### Use of death penalty prevents future murders

**[For the first time in a generation, the question of whether the death
penalty deters murders has captured the attention of scholars in law and
economics]{.underline}**, setting off an intense new debate about one of
the central justifications for capital punishment. **[According to
roughly a dozen recent studies, executions save lives. For each inmate
put to death, the studies say, 3 to 18 murders are prevented. The effect
is most pronounced, according to some studies, in Texas]{.underline}**
and other states that execute condemned inmates relatively often and
relatively quickly. The studies, performed by economists in the past
decade, compare the number of executions in different jurisdictions with
homicide rates over time --- while trying to eliminate the effects of
crime rates, conviction rates and other factors --- and say that
**[murder rates tend to fall as executions rise]{.underline}**. One
influential study looked at 3,054 counties over two decades.

## Deterrence

### Deterrent effect of death penalty provides an ethical justification for its use

Adam Liptak, New York Times, November 18, 2007 Does Death Penalty Save
Lives? A New Debate,

**[But the studies have started to reshape the debate over capital
punishment and to influence prominent legal scholars. "The evidence on
whether it has a significant deterrent effect seems sufficiently
plausible that the moral issue becomes a difficult one]{.underline}**,"
said Cass R. Sunstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago who
has frequently taken liberal positions. "**[I did shift from being
against the death penalty to thinking that if it has a significant
deterrent effect it's probably justified]{.underline}**." Professor
Sunstein and Adrian Vermeule, a law professor at Harvard, wrote in their
own Stanford Law Review article that "**[the recent evidence of a
deterrent effect from capital punishment seems impressive, especially in
light of its 'apparent power and unanimity]{.underline}**,' " quoting a
conclusion of a separate overview of the evidence in 2005 by Robert
Weisberg, a law professor at Stanford, in the Annual Review of Law and
Social Science. "Capital **[punishment may well save lives," the two
professors continued. "Those who object to capital punishment, and who
do so in the name of protecting life, must come to terms with the
possibility that the failure to inflict capital punishment will fail to
protect life."]{.underline}**

### Death penalty provides the only effective deterrent 

Morgan Reynolds, Director Criminal Justice Center National Center for
Policy Analysis, March 1, 2000 The Death Penalty: Fair and Effective in
Texas,
http://heartland.org/policy-documents/death-penalty-fair-and-effective-texas

**[Seven types of murder can qualify as capital crimes in Texas: murder
of a child under six years of age; murder of a public safety officer,
firefighter, or correctional officer; murder for hire; murder during the
commission of specified felonies such as robbery; murders committed
during prison escapes; murder by a prisoner serving a life sentence for
any of five offenses; and multiple murders. All murders are not the same
event. Executions are saved for the worst and serve obvious utilitarian
ends]{.underline}**. Marginal deterrence\--signaling\--is necessary to
discourage marginal harm. Robbers, for example, must be encouraged to
leave victims and witnesses alive. **[Murderers must have an incentive
to stop at one life snuffed. Guards need protection from \"lifers,\" and
everybody does from prison escapees. We\'re kidding ourselves if we
believe that a life sentence means total isolation from society. Only
death offers such separation.]{.underline}**

### The death penalty has empirically reduced murder rates in Texas

Morgan Reynolds, Director Criminal Justice Center National Center for
Policy Analysis, March 1, 2000 The Death Penalty: Fair and Effective in
Texas

**[Some acts are bad enough to deserve the death penalty as impartial
retribution]{.underline}**, pure and simple. Remember Jeffrey Dahmer,
that butcher of boys and young men in Milwaukee? No death penalty in
Wisconsin, so he got a life sentence from the court. But his fellow
inmates gave him a death sentence, killing him in prison. So who was
more just, the state or the inmates? I\'d say the inmates got it right,
even if they took the law into their own hands. Local sentiment varies,
but government must take such opinion into account\--**[if too many
criminals walk or the system is too soft, people will do the job on
criminals that government won\'t. Does the death penalty deter? In
Texas, the murder rate has fallen over 60 percent since the state
started using the death penalty seriously for selected crimes in the
1990s, while the national murder rate fell 33 percent. Coincidence?
Maybe. But the spirit and practice of orderly retribution is a mark of
civilization. Societies unwilling to execute their worst criminals
expose the low value they place on the lives of victims.]{.underline}**

## Neg: Lethal Injection Drug is Humane

### Claims of inhumane effects of lethal injection drug are false

Kyle Janek, State Senator and anesthesiologist, February 1, 2004, Attack
on Texas\' lethal injections is bogus, Houston Chronicle

**[Having no hope of overturning capital punishment itself at the ballot
box or through the court system, a few vocal death penalty opponents,
including inmates, have rolled out a new strategy to change how it is
carried out]{.underline}**. In what amounts to practicing medicine
without a license, those critics have started to attack the inclusion of
pancuronium bromide as one of the medications used in the lethal
injection process. **[They claim its use is \"cruel and unusual.\" Is
pancuronium bromide some new, untested drug whose sole purpose is to
torture]{.underline}**? Is it perhaps an exotic street drug that should
be outlawed? Well, actually \... no. **[Pancuronium bromide is a
federally approved medication used routinely in hundreds of thousands of
medical procedures in this country every year. I know that because, as a
licensed, practicing anesthesiologist for the last 20 years, I have
given pancuronium bromide and similar drugs to thousands of patients in
the operating room, albeit with different results. As any other
anesthesiologist will tell you, this argument involving pancuronium
bromide is bogus]{.underline}**.

### Lethal injection drug is not torture

Kyle Janek, State Senator and anesthesiologist, February 1, 2004, Attack
on Texas\' lethal injections is bogus, Houston Chronicle

**[The current argument against executions seems to hinge on the
supposition that the second and 3rd drugs in this regimen would be cruel
to someone who could feel them]{.underline}** - and, to be candid, that
assertion is true, since the pancuronium would cause a patient to be
paralyzed and unable to respond to the pain of the potassium injection.
**[Yet for that argument to be valid in any way, you must ignore the 1st
drug in the process - sodium pentothal - that (1) renders the inmate to
be completely unconscious]{.underline}**, (2) **[has been used for
decades to induce anesthesia in surgical patients and (3) is given in
doses far exceeding what is needed to keep the inmate from being aware
or feeling anything. Regardless of one\'s feelings about the death
penalty as a moral punishment, as a deterrent or whether it is meted out
fairly - this latest objection has neither logic nor science to support
it. If it did, it would follow that anesthesiologists and nurse
anesthetists in this country have been treating patients
\"unconstitutionally\" for decade]{.underline}**s. Some years ago, a
similar - and unsuccessful - protest was raised that the drugs given for
lethal injection hadn\'t been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration as being \"safe and effective.\" Such logic is every bit
as tortured as the current flap over pancuronium bromide.

### Lethal injection is humane

Dudley Sharp, advocate for Justice Matters, April 27, 2007. "Lethal
injection: What pain? Current controversies resolved," MEDICAL NEWS
TODAY, accessed August 28, 2007,
http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/youropinions.php?opinionid=16446 "The
evidence, including the **[immediate autopsy of executed serial
murderer/rapist Michael Ross, supports that there is no pain within the
lethal injection process.]{.underline}** There is a concern that some
inmates may be conscious, but paralyzed, during execution, because one
of the three drugs used may have worn off, prior to death. First, there
is no evidence this has occurred. Secondly, **[if]{.underline}**
**[properly administered, it cannot occur with the properties and
amounts of the chemicals used and within the time frame of an
execution]{.underline}**. "

## Death Penalty Not Racist

### The application of the death penalty is not racist

Charles Lane, The American Interest, November December 2010, The Death
Penalty and Racism
[[http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=901]{.underline}](http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=901)

This assessment begins by acknowledging that **[African Americans commit
a disproportionate number of murders in the United States: approximately
half, according to government statistics. Yet in the death penalty
states of post-Gregg America, black murderers have actually been
somewhat less likely to wind up on death row than their white
counterparts]{.underline}**. Blacks **[committed 51.5 percent of
murders]{.underline}** nationwide between 1976 and 1998, according to a
2004 study by Professors Cornell law professors John Blume, Theodore
Eisenberg and Martin T. Wells, **[but accounted for only 41.3 percent of
those sentenced to death from 1977 to 1999. This relationship held true
in every death penalty state, and---contrary to conventional
wisdom---the under-representation of blacks on death row was greatest in
the South]{.underline}**. Only California, Utah and Nevada came close to
sentencing black murderers to death in proportion to their share of the
total.

### Racism claims are false

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

The support for this claim is said to be the undisputed fact that,
**[when compared to their percentage in the overall population,
African-Americans are overrepresented on death row. For example, while
12 percent of the population is African-American, about 43 percent of
death row inmates are African-American, and 38 percent of prisoners
executed]{.underline}** since 1977 are African-American. 43 Such simple
statistics of overrepresentation fail to prove racial bias. **[The
relevant population for comparison is not the general population, but
rather the population of murderers. If the death penalty is administered
without regard to race, the percentage of AfricanAmerican death row
inmates found at the end of the process should not exceed the percentage
of African-American defendants charged with murder at the beginning. The
available statistics indicate that is precisely what
happens]{.underline}**. The Department of Justice found that while
**[African-Americans constituted 48 percent of adults charged with
homicide, they were only 42 percent of those admitted to prison under
sentence of death]{.underline}**. In other words, once arrested for
murder, blacks are actually less likely to receive a capital sentence
than are whites.

### Large population of minorities on death row is not proof of racism

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

**[The over-representation of AfricanAmericans on death
row]{.underline}** to which Jackson refers **[is]{.underline}**,
indisputably, **[of great public concern. Policy makers must certainly
examine the causes of that over-representation---for example,
differences in economic or educational opportunities---and address them.
But given such societal factors, racial bias cannot be inferred from
such simplistic calculations.]{.underline}**

## No Racism

### Statistics of overcharging minorities are false

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

**[Critics of this data might argue that police may be more likely to
charge African-Americans than whites with murder at the outset of the
process. The data does not support this]{.underline}**. One way of
investigating this claim is to analyze crime victim reports of the race
of those who have committed crimes against them. **[While it is
obviously impossible to talk to murder victims, it is possible talk to
victims of armed robberies, who are reasonable surrogates. When victims'
reports of armed robbery cases are compared with the criminal justice
processing of those cases, there is no evidence of racial discrimination
in charging decision.]{.underline}**

### Statistics show no racism in application of death penalty

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

**[To confirm or dispel concern about black defendants being singled out
for the death penalty, one must conduct more sophisticated social
science research. Various researchers]{.underline}** (often of an
abolitionist bent) **[have set out to prove such racial discrimination.
They have been disappointed. The studies of the post-Furman death
penalty in America have generally found that AfricanAmerican defendants
are not more likely to receive the death penalt]{.underline}**y.
Summarizing all the data in 1990, **[the General Accounting Office
concluded that evidence that blacks were discriminated against was
"equivoc]{.underline}**al." Similarly, in a comprehensive study
Professor Baldus and his colleagues reported that "**[regardless of the
methodology used," studies show "no systematic race-of defendant"
effect.]{.underline}**

### Racism claims are outdated and no longer apply 

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

**[This ought to be treated as good news of progress in the American
criminal justice system. One could draw the following conclusion---that,
while African-American defendants in capital cases were previously
treated unfairly (especially in the South), modern statistics reveal
considerable progress. This conclusion, of course, is anathema to the
agenda of abolitionists.]{.underline}**

## AT Racism

### Claims of increased death penalty for African Americans killing whites are false

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

**[Abolitionist Bryan Stevenson argues that data demonstrates the
existence of "racial bias in Georgia's use of the death penalty," by
which he means statistics suggesting that blacks who kill whites are
more likely to receive a death penalty than are other victim/ offender
combinations. These specialist statistics are no less misleading than
the mass market statistics]{.underline}**

### Types of crimes committed explain the difference -- not racism

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

Statisticians Stanley Rothman and Stephen Powers have offered the best
review of the relevant data. 49 As they explain, **[the vast majority of
homicides]{.underline}** (no less than other offenses) **[are
intraracial: about 95 percent do not cross racial lines. The small
minority of interracial homicides have vastly different characteristics.
Black-on-black homicides and white-on-white homicides are most likely to
occur during altercations between persons who know one another,
circumstances often viewed as inappropriate for the death
penalty]{.underline}**. On the other hand, **[black-on-white homicides
are much more often committed during the course of a serious felony, a
classic case for the death penalty]{.underline}**. For example, in
Georgia, only 7 percent of the blackdefendant-kills-black-victim cases
involve armed robbery; compared to 67 percent of the
black-defendant-kills-white-victim cases. Similarly,
black-defendant-killswhite-victim cases more often involve the murder of
a law enforcement officer, kidnapping and rape, mutilation,
execution-style killing, and torture---all quintessential aggravating
factors---than do other combinations**[. Finally,
whitedefendant-kills-black-victim cases are so rare that it is difficult
to draw meaningful statistical conclusions.]{.underline}**

### Statistical claims of race are flawed

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

**[Given these obvious differences between, on the one hand,
intra-racial homicides and, on the other, black-onwhite homicides, the
simple comparisons of the percent of death sentences within each
classification]{.underline}** reported in this volume by both Stephenson
and Bright **[is un-illuminating]{.underline}**. To put the point in
more precise statistical terms, **[an alleged race-of-the-victim effect
will be an obvious "spurious" correlation. To cite but one example, a
significant number of death penalty cases involve murder of law
enforcement officers, about 85 percent of whom are white. Unless there
are statistical controls for this fact, it is virtually certain that a
simple eyeballing of statistics will show a race-of-thevictim effect
that is instead immediately explainable by this fact]{.underline}**
(among many others).

## Deterrence

### Death penalty deters all kinds of crimes

Richard Roper, United States Attorney Northern District of Texas, Fall
2008, THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE INTERSECTION OF REALITY AND JUSTICE,
Texas Tech Law Review, 41 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 15

**[At the forefront of pursuing the death penalty is the hope that
future innocent victims will be spared. Recent studies, which draw on
empirical evidence]{.underline}** from the thirty years since the
restoration of the death penalty in Gregg v. Georgia, **[demonstrate
that the death penalty is a strong, successful deterrent. One national
study suggests that on average each execution prevents eighteen murders.
Another estimates that each execution deters an average of fourteen
murders, and a third study]{.underline}**, by Joanna M. Shepherd, found
**[that on average each execution deters three murders. Earlier research
reaches the same conclusion: execution deters murder]{.underline}**.
Similarly, a study by Mocan and Gittings focuses on the impact of
commutations as well as executions: \"**[Each additional execution
decreases homicides by about five, and each additional commutation
increases homicides by the same amount, while one additional removal
from death row generates one additional homicide.\" Notably, the impact
of executions reaches beyond murder, as it deters other crimes as
well.]{.underline}**

### Critics of deterrence claims are wrong

Richard Roper, United States Attorney Northern District of Texas, Fall
2008, THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE INTERSECTION OF REALITY AND JUSTICE,
Texas Tech Law Review, 41 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 15

**[Those who doubt whether crime statistics can be used to gauge the
deterrence effect of capital punishment rely heavily on two basic
assumptions. First, they suppose that many murderers \"are simply
unresponsive to punishment threats.\" Second, they theorize that because
relatively few persons are actually executed, \"it is hard to believe
that in modern America the fear of execution would be a driving force in
a rational criminal\'s calculus.\" These assumptions, however, are
subject to strong countervailing arguments.]{.underline}** One
commentator reports that **[the death penalty deters nearly all types of
murder, including \"crime-of-passion murders.\" Similarly, \"it is
difficult to deny theoretically the plausibility of a death penalty
sanction deterring serious murders, at least \[with regard to\]
premeditated deaths or felony murders.\" These assumptions ignore the
notion that if criminal statutes generally are successful in deterring
crime, the death penalty should not be any different. Few would dispute
that criminal statutes have a deterrent effect on the commission of
crime]{.underline}**. Scholars often cite extracting longer sentences
from criminals as a significant factor in reducing the violent crime
rate to recent historic lows. Indeed, \"evidence linking increased
punishment to lower crime rates is very strong.\"

### The deterrent effect justifies the use of the death penalty

Michael Graczyk, January 6, 2010, Study: Death penalty in Texas a
homicide deterrent,
[[http://www.myssnews.com/news-telegram/news/state-news/8533-study-death-penalty-in-texas-a-homicide-deterrent.html]{.underline}](http://www.myssnews.com/news-telegram/news/state-news/8533-study-death-penalty-in-texas-a-homicide-deterrent.html)

**[This study, however, is the first to focus on monthly data in Texas,
where researchers said the number of executions \-- 447 since capital
punishment resumed in 1982 \-- is statistically significant enough \"to
make possible relatively stable estimates of the homicide response to
executions.\" A national deterrent effect can\'t be determined because
\"most states \... have not engaged in a sufficient level or frequency
of executions per year]{.underline}**,\" they said. Kent Scheidegger,
legal director of the California-based Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation, which supports capital punishment**[, said the study \"would
be sufficient by itself to justify the death penalty.\"]{.underline}**

## Deterrence

### Other punishments are not an effective deterrent

Richard Roper, United States Attorney Northern District of Texas, Fall
2008, THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE INTERSECTION OF REALITY AND JUSTICE,
Texas Tech Law Review, 41 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 15

Of course, **[the death penalty conclusively deters an executed murderer
from ever killing again. But so would life without parole, according to
death penalty opponents]{.underline}**. In fact, such incarceration does
provide a measure of protection to the public. **[Considering the
realities of prison life and resources, however, this alternative to the
death penalty is, at times, a less attractive option]{.underline}**. As
one court notes, \"\[W\]e recognize that **[assaults and murders will
occur in prisons despite the most vigilant of official
conduct]{.underline}**.\" Consider, for example, Carlos David Caro, a
prison gang member confined to federal prison on a drug trafficking
charge, who was placed in segregation after stabbing a rival gang member
twenty-nine times. When guards temporarily placed another inmate in his
two-person cell, the new inmate lasted less than twenty-four hours
because Caro, after arguing with the new inmate over breakfast, took a
towel, strangled the other inmate, and called on the prison guards to
\"\[g\]et this piece of s\-- out of here\[.\]\"Another example is Victor
Ganus, one of those Illinois death row inmates fortunate enough to
receive a commutation from Governor Ryan. **[While serving a life
sentence for murder, Ganus brutally executed a fellow inmate by
strangling and stabbing him]{.underline}**. **[A quick search in any
legal database reveals many additional violent, brutal prison
murders.]{.underline}**

### Death penalty is an effective deterrent 

Richard Roper, United States Attorney Northern District of Texas, Fall
2008, THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE INTERSECTION OF REALITY AND JUSTICE,
Texas Tech Law Review, 41 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 15

Because **[criminal penalties generally have a deterrent effect, this
effect should not stop at the gateway of capital murder offenses.
Following this logic, one commentator notes the absurdity of denying the
death penalty\'s influence before the crime given its influence after
apprehension: Those studies showing no such effect would seem to require
a behavioral explanation for why the general process of cost-benefit
decision making does not apply for murderers before they commit their
crimes, despite the fact that it influences their decisions after they
are apprehended, during the trial process, and during
incarceration]{.underline}**. It seems implausible, for instance, that
**[criminals simply assume, unrealistically, they will get away with
their crimes, and that they only become cognizant of the risk of death
penalty when caught, given that the majority of murders in the United
States do in fact result in arrest.]{.underline}**

### Even the threat of death penalty can be an effective deterrent 

Richard Roper, United States Attorney Northern District of Texas, Fall
2008, THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE INTERSECTION OF REALITY AND JUSTICE,
Texas Tech Law Review, 41 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 15

**[The threat of the death penalty also serves additional utilitarian
goals. For example, Gary Ridgeway, the notorious \"Green River Killer,\"
was arrested for murdering seven women in the State of
Washington]{.underline}** after a crime spree encompassing two decades
left a trail of innumerable dead women. Prosecutors decided to forego
seeking the death penalty in exchange for Ridgeway\'s assistance in
clearing the murders and locating the bodies of other missing women he
executed. **[Ridgeway pleaded guilty to the murder of forty-eight women.
He also confessed to several murders for which law enforcement officials
had little evidence, and assisted the officers in locating the bodies of
those missing victims. Without the threat of the death penalty, Ridgeway
would likely never have been motivated to assist officers in solving
these murders.]{.underline}**

## AT Innocent People Executed

### No empirical evidence of innocent persons being executed

Richard Roper, United States Attorney Northern District of Texas, Fall
2008, THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE INTERSECTION OF REALITY AND JUSTICE,
Texas Tech Law Review, 41 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 15

**[Death penalty opponents justifiably raise questions as to whether our
criminal justice system sufficiently produces reliable results to
warrant the continued use of the death penalty]{.underline}**. In fact,
several studies advocate that we have convicted a number of defendants
for capital murder who were later \"exonerated.\" From these studies,
ardent opponents of the death penalty stridently exalt \"probable
concerns about the justice of maintaining a capital punishment system in
which there is a substantial risk that innocents routinely will be
executed.\" The fact is, **[no reliable evidence exists to establish
that any innocent defendants have been executed in the over thirty years
following Gregg. Moreover, these \"exoneration\" studies have been
subjected to strong criticism from commentators who argue that very few
of these exonerated defendants are, in fact, innocent. Rather, nearly
all of these exonerated defendants were tried in cases involving
reversible error and a prosecutor who later decided against pursuing the
death penalt]{.underline}**y, as the authors of these studies concede.
Note also **[that the percentage of capital murder exonerations is very
small considering the large number of murder convictions during that
time period. Indeed, \"\[w\]rongful convictions can be, and . . .
probably are, both systemic and exceedingly rare.\"]{.underline}**

### Claims of innocent people executed should be viewed skeptically

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

**[The questionable examples in the Bedau-Radelet article make an
important point about the debate over mistaken executions. It is easy
for opponents of the death penalty to allege, despite a unanimous jury
verdict, appellate court review, and denial of executive clemency, that
an "innocent" person has been executed. Such an assertion costs nothing
and will help abolitionists advance their cause. As this review
demonstrates, such claims should be reviewed with a healthy dose of
skepticism.]{.underline}**

### Risk of innocent executions do not justify the elimination of the death penalty

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

While **[abolitionists have been unable to find a credible case of an
innocent person who has actually been executed in recent
years]{.underline}**, they have provided several credible "close call"
cases---that is, examples of innocent persons who were sentenced to
death who were exonerated shortly before the execution. **[Such
miscarriages of justice are, to be sure, very troubling. These cases
deserve careful study to determine what went wrong and what kinds of
reforms can correct the problem. But when offered as justification for
abolishing the death penalty, these close call cases are
unpersuasive]{.underline}**

## AT Innocent Persons Executed

### Greater risk of injustice if death penalty not used

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

**[To justify abolishing the death penalty on grounds of risk to the
innocent, abolitionists would have to establish that innocent persons
are jeopardized more by the retention of the death penalty than from its
absence.]{.underline}** In fact, **[the balance of risk tips decisively
in favor of retaining the death penalty. On the one hand, abolitionists
have been unable to demonstrate that even a single innocent person has
been executed in error. On the other hand, there are numerous documented
cases of innocent persons who have died because of our society's failure
to carry out death sentences.]{.underline}**

### Using the death penalty is the only way to protect the innocent

Honorable Paul G. Cassell, Judge, Article for Institute for the
Advancement of Criminal Justice Journal, Summer 2008, In Defense of the
Death Penalty,
[http://www.da-tulareco.org/PDF/In_defense_of_the_DP.pdf]{.underline}

Earlier in this text, for example, I discussed the deaths of Colleen
Reed and many other women because of society's failure to execute a
single dangerous murderer---Kenneth Allen McDuff. The victims of McDuff
were no "close calls" but rather fatalities directly resulting from
abolition of the death penalty in 1972. **[Today, thousands of killers
no less dangerous than McDuff are currently incarcerated on the nation's
death rows. If they are not executed, they will remain serious threats
to kill again---either inside prison walls or outside following an
escape or a parole. Clearly, on any realistic assessment, the innocent
are far more at risk from allowing these dangerous convicts to live than
from executing them after a full and careful review of their legal
claims.]{.underline}**

### No proven innocent person executed in the last century

Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director, October 1, 1997 DEATH
PENALTY AND SENTENCING INFORMATION,
[[http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/dp.html]{.underline}](http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/dp.html)

**[Another significant oversight by that study was not differentiating
between the risk of executing innocent persons before and after
Furman]{.underline}** v Georgia (1972). **[There is, in fact, no proof
that an innocent has been executed since 1900. And the probability of
such a tragedy occurring has been lowered significantly more since
Furman]{.underline}**. In the context that hundreds of thousands of
innocents have been murdered or seriously injured, since 1900, by
criminals improperly released by the U.S. criminal justice system (or
not incarcerated at all!), the relevant question is:
**[Is]{.underline}** **[the risk of executing the innocent, however
slight, worth the justifications for the death penalty - those being
retribution, rehabilitation, incapacitation, required punishment,
deterrence, escalating punishments, religious mandates, cost savings,
the moral imperative, just punishment and the saving of innocent
lives]{.underline}**?

###  

## Neg: Deterrence

### Death penalty deters future crime

Roy D. Adler and Michael Summers, Wall Street Journal, November 2, 2007,
Capital Punishment Works.

**[The conclusion that each execution carried out is associated with the
saving of dozens of innocent lives creates an extraordinarily difficult
moral dilemma for those who campaign against the death
penalty]{.underline}**. Until now, those activists could look into the
eyes of a convicted killer, hear his or her sad story, work tirelessly
to set aside the execution and, with that goal accomplished, feel good
about themselves for having \"saved a life.\" **[These data suggest that
the moral equation is not nearly that simplistic.]{.underline}**

**[It now seems that the proper question to ask goes far beyond the
obvious one of \"do we save the life of this convicted criminal?\" The
more proper question seems to be \"do we save this particular life, at a
cost of the lives of dozens of future murder victims?\" That is a much
more difficult moral dilemma, which deserves wide discussion in a free
society.]{.underline}**

### Studies show a large decrease in murders as a result of the death penalty

Roy D. Adler and Michael Summers, Wall Street Journal, November 2, 2007,
Capital Punishment Works.

**[Recent high-profile events have reopened the debate about the value
of capital punishment in a just society. This is an important
discussion]{.underline}**, because the taking of a human life is always
a serious matter. **[Most commentators who oppose capital punishment
assert that an execution has no deterrent effect on future crimes.
Recent evidence, however, suggests that the death penalty, when carried
out, has an enormous deterrent effect on the number of murders. More
precisely, our recent research shows that each execution carried out is
correlated with about 74 fewer murders the following year. For any
society concerned about human life, that type of evidence is something
that should be taken very seriously]{.underline}**.

### Statistical evidence demonstrates the deterrent effect

Roy D. Adler and Michael Summers, Wall Street Journal, November 2, 2007,
Capital Punishment Works.

**[In the early 1980s, the return of the death penalty was associated
with a drop in the number of murders. In the mid-to-late 1980s, when the
number of executions stabilized at about 20 per year, the number of
murders increased. Throughout the 1990s, our society increased the
number of executions, and the number of murders
plummeted.]{.underline}** Since 2001, there has been a decline in
executions and an increase in murders. **[It is possible that this
correlated relationship could be mere coincidence]{.underline}**, so we
did a regression analysis on the 26-year relationship. The association
was significant at the .00005 level, which meant the **[odds against the
pattern being simply a random happening are about 18,000 to one. Further
analysis revealed that each execution seems to be associated with 71
fewer murders in the year the execution took place.]{.underline}**

## AT Innocent People Executed

### Risk of innocent people being executed does not make the death penalty unjust

Eugene H. Methvin, Wall Street Journal, May 10, 2000. Death Penalty Is
Fairer than Ever

**[Even Hugo Bedau, a professor at Tufts University and a leading
abolitionist, has admitted that it is "false sentimentality to argue
that the death penalty ought to be abolished because of the abstract
possibility that an innocent person might be executed]{.underline}**
when the record fails to disclose that such cases occur." **[That drunk
drivers kill thousands of innocents, that airplanes fall, that
pedestrians get smashed by cars, does not prevent us from drinking,
flying or crossing the street. But the possibility that an innocent
person may be executed is supposed to make us give up capital punishment
because "death is irrevocable."]{.underline}**

### Procedural difficulties make innocent executions unlikely

Eugene H. Methvin, Wall Street Journal, May 10, 2000. Death Penalty Is
Fairer than Ever

**[Many death-row convictions are overturned not on questions of guilt
but on procedural grounds]{.underline}**, in a judicial war against the
death penalty. The Georgia Supreme Court in March 2000 overturned the
death sentence of a killer who nearly decapitated a former girlfriend.
The court found the prosecutor had wrongly urged jurors to follow the
biblical mandate: "All they who take up the sword shall die by the
sword." Departing from prior decisions approving biblical arguments,
Justice Norman Fletcher decreed: "Biblical references . . . improperly
appeal to the religious beliefs of jurors." **[Other judges have voided
death sentences because jurors weren't told the killer would otherwise
get life without parole. Prosecutors, however, are forbidden to argue
that killers might escape, which they do, even from high-security
facilities.]{.underline}**

### Multiple appeals and DNA testing prevent innocent executions

Eugene H. Methvin, Wall Street Journal, May 10, 2000. Death Penalty Is
Fairer than Ever

**[Multiple appeals not only make executing the innocent more unlikely
than ever, they make it hard to execute the clearly
guilty]{.underline}**. Illinois executed **[John Wayne
Gacy]{.underline}** in 1994 for murdering 33 young men. He had
confessed, and his guilt was never in the slightest doubt. Yet his
lawyers consumed 14 years with legal delays. "He **[had 523 separate
appeals]{.underline}**," fumes House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R.,
Ill.). "**[And none were based on a claim of innocence]{.underline}**."
Things haven't changed much since then. On the first anniversary of the
Oklahoma City bombing, Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act. For the first time in 128 years, legislators used
their constitutional authority to strip the Supreme Court and lower
federal judges of jurisdiction to hear appeals for a certain class of
case. Even under this change, a state convict can still have 10 appeals
(in some cases 12), before the new law affects him. He can go through
five or six state and federal courts on direct appeal, then go through
them again with habeas corpus petitions. But for a second federal habeas
corpus review, Congress decreed, convicts must get permission from a
three-judge federal appeals panel. If he is turned down, the Supreme
Court can grant only one further review, and only in rare circumstances.
**[As for DNA, that is doing much more than just helping re-evaluate
convictions. At least 64 U.S. criminal convictions have been set aside
as a result of DNA testing, according to the Innocence Project of the
Cardozo Wrongful Executions Are Not Likely to Occur But DNA testing also
allows investigators to eliminate many suspects early on, and
concentrate on pursuing the real perpetrators.]{.underline}**

## Deterrence

### Deterrence claims are true

Dudley Sharp, October 29, 2003, The Deterrent Effect of the Death
Penalty,
[[http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm]{.underline}](http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm)

**[The potential for negative consequences deters some behavior. The
most severe criminal sanction \-- execution \-- does not contradict that
finding]{.underline}**. Reason, common sense, history and the weight of
the studies support the deterrent effect of the death penalty. **[The
death penalty protects innocent lives. The absence of the death penalty
sacrifices innocent lives. Is there any group, be they criminologists,
historians, psychologists, economists, philosophers, physicians,
journalists or criminals that does not recognize that the prospect of
negative consequences constrains or deters the behavior of some? Of
course not]{.underline}** \-- not even fiction writers so speculate.
Even irrational people wear seat belts, choose not to smoke and do not
rob police stations because of the potential for negative consequences.

### Defendants cooperate to avoid the death penalty

Dudley Sharp, October 29, 2003, The Deterrent Effect of the Death
Penalty,
[[http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm]{.underline}](http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm)

**[At every level of the criminal justice process, virtually all
criminals do everything they can to lessen possible
punishments]{.underline}**. I estimate that **[less than 1% of all
convicted capital murderers request a death sentence in the punishment
phase of their trial. The apprehended criminals\' desire for lesser
punishments is overwhelming and unchallenged]{.underline}**. Of the 7300
inmates sentenced to death since 1973, 85, or 1.2% have waived remaining
appeals and been executed. 98.8% have not waived appeals. The evidence
is overwhelming that murderers would rather live on death row than die.
Why? The survival effect \-- **[life is preferred over death and death
is feared more than life. Even on death row, that is the rule. Even such
marginalized personalities as capital murderers fear death more than
imprisonment. And that which we fear the most, deters the
most]{.underline}**. (kudos to Ernest van den Haag and many others) It
is logical to conclude that some of those less marginalized
personalities, who choose not to murder, also, overwhelmingly, fear
death more than life, and, we, thus, logically conclude that some are
deterred from murdering because of the enhanced deterrent effect of
execution. **[The evidence for the survival effect in pretrial, trial
and appeals is overwhelming and that weighs in favor of execution as a
deterrent and as an enhanced deterrent over lesser
sentences.]{.underline}**

### Death penalty saves lives

Dudley Sharp, October 29, 2003, The Deterrent Effect of the Death
Penalty,
[[http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm]{.underline}](http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm)

**[Common sense, reason and history all support that the potential for
negative consequences restricts the behavior of some]{.underline}**.
But, if unsure of deterrence, we face the following dilemma \-- If
executions do deter, halting executions causes more innocents to be
murdered and gives those living murderers the opportunity to harm and
murder again. **[If the death penalty does not deter, and we do execute,
we punish murderers as the jury deemed appropriate and we prevent those
executed murderers from harming or murdering again]{.underline}**.
Oddly, death penalty opponents believe that the burden of proof is on
those who say the death penalty is a deterrent. Clearly it is not.
**[The weight of the evidence, within reason, history, common sense and
the social sciences is that the potential for negative consequences
restricts the behavior of some. That is not in dispute. Furthermore, if
opponents cannot prove it is not a deterrent, which they never have and
never will, then they are the ones who risk sacrificing innocents, both
by absence of deterrence and reduced incapacitation.]{.underline}**

## Deterrence

### Studies finding no deterrence are biased and flawed

Dudley Sharp, October 29, 2003, The Deterrent Effect of the Death
Penalty,
[[http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm]{.underline}](http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm)

**[In reviewing 30 years of deterrence studies, the strongest statement
one may make against deterrence is that there is conflicting data. Yet,
even when academic bias against capital punishment is
overt]{.underline}**, such as in the case of the American Society of
Criminology \-- the subtitle to their death penalty resources page is
\"Anti-Capital Punishment Resources\" \-- **[even they fail to state
that the death penalty does not deter some potential murderers, only
that \"social science research has found no consistent evidence of crime
deterrence through execution.\" That is far from stating that executions
do not deter. And the criminologists are, very likely, that academic
group most hostile toward the death penalty.]{.underline}** What social
science conflicts with the notion that the potential for negative
consequences restrains the behavior of some? And **[most would agree
that execution is the most serious negative consequence that a murderer
may face.]{.underline}**

### Even conflicting studies justify the use of the death penalty as a deterrent

Dudley Sharp, October 29, 2003, The Deterrent Effect of the Death
Penalty,
[[http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm]{.underline}](http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm)

**[Numerous studies find that executions do deter. And there is a
rational conclusion based upon common experience. It appears that all
criminal sanctions deter some. It would be irrational to conclude that
the most severe and publicized sanction \-- execution \-- does not deter
some potential murderers. Those studies which do not find deterrence say
that they could not detect it, not that it doesn\'t
exist]{.underline}**. Those studies which find for deterrence state
such. As Professor Cloninger states: \" . . . (Our recent) study is but
another on a growing list of empirical work that finds evidence
consistent with the deterrence hypothesis. **[These studies as a whole
provide robust evidence \-- evidence obtained from a variety of
different models, data sets and methodologies that yield the same
conclusion. It is the cumulative effect of these studies that causes any
neutral observer to pause.\" Conflicting studies and reason both weigh
in favor of the death penalty as a deterrent and as an enhanced
deterrent over lesser punishments.]{.underline}**

### Brutalization claims are false

Dudley Sharp, October 29, 2003, The Deterrent Effect of the Death
Penalty,
[[http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm]{.underline}](http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm)

Some, particularly **[death penalty opponents, find that the
brutalization effect is more likely than the deterrent effect. The
brutalization effect finds that murders will increase because potential
murderers will murder because of the example of state
executions]{.underline}**. Why would potential and active murderers be
so influenced by the state in such a deep philosophical manner, revealed
by brutalization, but they wouldn\'t be more affected by the simple
\"you murder, we execute you?\" Death penalty opponents make an
interesting about face on this issue. **[They insist that criminals are
so thoughtless and impulsive that they can\'t be affected by the
potential of negative consequences but, then, those same opponents see
criminals as so contemplative that their criminal actions increase
BECAUSE those criminals follow the example of the state. One might ask
those opponents: \"Is there any other government action which influences
criminals in such a fashion?\" Do criminals kidnap more BECAUSE the
state increases incarceration rates? Do criminals give money to
potential victims BECAUSE the state donates to needy
causes?]{.underline}**

## Death Penalty Just

### Death penalty is ethical

Dudley Sharp, October 29, 2003, The Deterrent Effect of the Death
Penalty,
[[http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm]{.underline}](http://www.hoshuha.com/resources/deteff.htm)

**[Those of us who support execution do so because it is a just
punishment. The moral foundation for all punishments is that they are
deserved.]{.underline}** One cannot support a punishment based upon
deterrence alone. Reason, common sense and history all fall on the side
of deterrence. Be it Sweden or Rwanda, Texas or Michigan, Singapore or
Chile, England or Japan, whether high crime rates or low, the death
penalty will always deter some potential murderers. Regardless of
jurisdiction, the potential for negative outcomes will always restrict
the behavior of some. **[And, the weight of the evidence clearly
supports execution as an enhanced deterrent. As Professor Rubin states,
\"Our evidence is that there are substantial benefits from executions
and, thus, substantial costs of changing this policy. We support
execution as a just and appropriate forfeiture of lives which deserve to
be taken. We also support execution as a just and appropriate method to
save lives which deserve to be saved]{.underline}**.

### Abolitionist claims are immoral 

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty Webpage,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[Abolitionists keep talking about the risks of a wrongful execution in
the death penalty\'s use. Well, being moral and just individuals, we
will not avoid taking issue with that risk. However, the risks involving
capital punishment is not nearly as dangerous or as insensitive to those
it puts at risk as the risks that are associated with abolitionist
standards]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[under the liberal influences in our
criminal justice system, the murder rate skyrocketed along with the
number of repeat offences. But those who endorse these liberal standards
never demonstrate the morality or the responsibility to take issue with
these lethal flaws]{.underline}** and work at least twice as hard to
protect the innocents that are threatened by the murderers they are so
dedicated to preserving. That is probably why the vast majority of
people around the world favor capital punishment, because the death
penalty never treats even the most hypothetical and highly unlikely of
risks involved in its use with nearly as much contempt and disregard as
abolitionists habitually treat countless of real life incidents as a
consequence of their agenda. **[This is what confirms capital
punishment\'s superior level of responsibility and
morality]{.underline}**.

### Death penalty is justified 

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty Webpage,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[The whole reason why nations and governments exist is to defend their
decent citizens from vicious criminals. When it fails to do that, they
become of little use to its citizens. When a society ignores their moral
duty to defend the safety and security of their decent citizens and
leaves them at the mercy of violent criminals, they are not being
\"civilized]{.underline}**,\" they are being negligent. I am certain
that there will come a time when **[all the nations in the world will be
forced to agree after decades of experience on this issue, that capital
punishment, like the military and the police force and taxes, is an
inevitable and unavoidable consequence of every civilized society and it
will no longer be a question of whether or not a nation should have the
death penalty, but rather how it should be used.]{.underline}**

###  

## Deterrence

### Death penalty empirically decreases murder rates

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[During the temporary suspension on capital punishment from 1972-1976,
researchers gathered murder statistics across the country. In 1960,
there were 56 executions in the USA and 9,140 murders. By 1964, when
there were only 15 executions, the number of murders had risen to 9,250.
In 1969, there were no executions and 14,590 murders, and 1975, after
six more years without executions, 20,510 murders occurred rising to
23,040 in 1980 after only two executions since 1976. In summary, between
1965 and 1980, the number of annual murders in the United States
skyrocketed from 9,960 to 23,040, a 131 percent increase. The murder
rate \-- homicides per 100,000 persons \-- doubled from 5.1 to
10.2]{.underline}**. So the number of murders grew as the number of
executions shrank. Researcher Karl Spence of Texas A&M University said:
\"**[While some \[death penalty\] abolitionists try to face down the
results of their disastrous experiment and still argue to the contrary,
the\...\[data\] concludes that a substantial deterrent effect has been
observed]{.underline}**\...In six months, more Americans are murdered
than have killed by execution in this entire century\...Until we begin
to fight crime in earnest \[by using the death penalty\], every person
who dies at a criminal\'s hands is a victim of our inaction.\"

### Deterrence effects are strongest in Texas

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty Webpage,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[The most striking protection of innocent life has been seen in Texas,
which executes more murderers than any other state. According to JFA
(Justice for All), the Texas murder rate in 1991 was 15.3 per 100,000.
By 1999, it had fallen to 6.1 \-- a drop of 60 percent]{.underline}**.
Within Texas, the most aggressive death penalty prosecutions are in
Harris County (the Houston area). Since **[the resumption of executions
in 1982, the annual number of Harris County murders has plummeted from
701 to 241 \-- a 72 percent]{.underline}** decrease. Edward Koch, former
mayor of New York City, said: \"**[Had the death penalty been a real
possibility in the minds of\...murderers, they might well have stayed
their hand. They might have shown moral awareness before their victims
died]{.underline}**\...Consider the tragic death of Rosa Velez, who
happened to be home when a man named Luis Vera burglarized her apartment
in Brooklyn. \"Yeah, I shot her,\" Vera admitted. \"\...and I knew I
wouldn\'t go to the chair.\"

### Recent studies confirm this

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[More recently, a series of academic studies within the last six years
show that the death penalty does indeed act as a deterrent to murder.
These analysts count that between three and 18 lives would be saved by
the execution of each convicted murderer]{.underline}**. Naci Mocan, an
economics professor at the University of Colorado at Denver, co-authored
a 2003 study and re-examined a 2006 study that found that each execution
results in five fewer homicides, and commuting a death sentence means
five more homicides. In an interview, he states: \"**[Science does
really draw a conclusion\...There is no question about it. The
conclusion is there is a deterrent effect. The results are robust. They
don\'t really go away. I oppose the death penalty. But my results show
that the death penalty (deters) - what am I going to do, hide
them]{.underline}**?\" These studies are among a dozen papers since 2001
that the death penalty has a deterrent effect. They all look at
executions and homicides by year and by state or county in order to
figure out the impact of the death penalty on homicides by accounting
for other factors, such as unemployment data and per capita income, the
probabilities of arrest and conviction and more.

## AT Life Without Parole

### This allows for murders to occur within prison

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty Webpage,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[Abolitionists claim that there are alternatives to the death penalty.
They say that life in prison without parole serves just as well.
Certainly, if you ignore all the murders criminals commit within prison
when they kill prison guards and other inmates, and also when they kill
decent citizens upon escape]{.underline}**, like Dawud Mu\'Min who was
serving a 48-year sentence for the 1973 murder of a cab driver when he
escaped a road work gang and stabbed to death a storekeeper named Gadys
Nopwasky in a 1988 robbery that netted \$4.00. Fortunately, there is now
no chance of Mu\'Min commiting murder again. He was executed by the
state of Virginia on November 14, 1997.

### Life without parole is not guaranteed to prevent future crimes

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty Webpage,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[Another flaw is that life imprisonment tends to deteriorate with the
passing of time]{.underline}**. Take the Moore case in New York State
for example. In **[1962, James Moore raped and strangled 14-year-old
Pamela Moss. Her parents decided to spare Moore the death penalty on the
condition that he be sentenced to life in prison without parole. Later
on, thanks to a change in sentencing laws in 1982, James Moore is
eligible for parole every two years]{.underline}**! If Pamela\'s parents
knew that they couldn\'t trust the state, Moore could have been executed
long ago and they could have put the whole horrible incident behind them
forever. Instead they have a nightmare to deal with biannually. I\'ll
bet not a day goes by that they don\'t kick themselves for being foolish
enough to trust the liberal sham that is life imprisonment and
rehabilitation. (**[According to the US Department of Justice, the
average prison sentence served for murder is five years and eleven
months.) Putting a murderer away for life just isn\'t good enough. Laws
change, so do parole boards, and people forget the past. Those are
things that cause life imprisonment to weather away. As long as the
murderer lives, there is always a chance, no matter how small, that he
will strike again. And there are people who run the criminal justice
system who are naive enough to allow him to repeat his
crime.]{.underline}**

### Empirical examples show not enforcing the death penalty results in violence

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty Webpage,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[Kenneth McDuff]{.underline}**, for instance, **[was convicted of the
1966 shooting deaths of two boys and the vicious rape-strangulation of
their 16-year-old female companion]{.underline}**. A Fort Worth jury
ruled that McDuff should die in the electric chair, a sentence commuted
to life in prison in 1972 after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the
death penalty as then imposed. **[In 1989, with Texas prisons
overflowing and state officials under fire from the federal judiciary,
McDuff was quietly turned loose on an unsuspecting citizenry. Within
days, a naked body of a woman turned up. Prostitute Sarafia Parker, 31,
had been beaten, strangled and dumped in a field near Temple. McDuff\'s
freedom in 1989 was interrupted briefly. Jailed after a minor racial
incident, he slithered through the system and was out again in
1990.]{.underline}**

## AT Costs

### Life without parole costs more

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty Webpage,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[There\'s a claim that it is more expensive for the state to execute a
criminal than to incarcerate him for life. Many opponents present, as
fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive]{.underline}**
(at least \$2 million per case?), **[that we must choose life without
parole]{.underline}** (\"LWOP\") at a cost of \$1 million for 50 years.
**[Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely
false]{.underline}**. JFA (Justice for All) estimates that LWOP cases
will cost \$1.2 million - \$3.6 million more than equivalent death
penalty cases. And life without parole prisoners face, on average, 30 or
40 years in prison while the annual cost of incarceration is \$40,000 to
\$50,000 a year for each prisoner or more! **[There is no question that
the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than
for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that,
over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive - from \$1.2 to
\$3.6 million - than death penalty cases. Opponents ludicrously claim
that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than
LWOP.]{.underline}**

### Threat of the death penalty encourages settlement and decreases costs

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

Also, **[U.S. states that repeal death penalty laws do not see a
significant savings in trial costs. In states where the death penalty is
the maximum punishment, a larger number of defendants are willing to
plead guilty and receive a life sentence. The greater cost of trials
where the prosecution does seek the death penalty is offset, at least in
part, by the savings from avoiding trial altogether in cases where the
defendant pleads guilty]{.underline}**. The study \-- The Death Penalty
and Plea Bargaining of Life Sentences \-- examined data gathered by the
U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics from 33 large urban counties. The
study examined how many of the murder cases were resolved by guilty
plea, how many went to trial and how many resulted in a sentence of at
least 20 years. In states with the death penalty, the average county
obtained sentences of 20 years or more in more than 50 percent of cases
where the defendant was convicted of murder or voluntary manslaughter.
**[In states without the death penalty, sentences of 20 years or more
were obtained in just more than 40 percent of such cases, but only 5
percent of those were guilty pleas, or just more than a quarter of the
number in the death penalty states]{.underline}**.

### Claims that life without parole is cheaper are flawed

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[The \$34,200 is conservative]{.underline}**, if TIME Magazine\'s
(2/7/94) research is accurate. TIME found that, nationwide, the average
cell cost is \$24,000/yr. and the maximum security cell cost is
\$75,000/yr. (as of12/95). Opponents claim that LWOP should replace the
DP. Therefore, any cost calculations should be based specifically on
cell costs for criminals who have committed the exact same category of
offense - in other words, cost comparisons are valid only if you compare
the costs of DP-equivalent LWOP cases to the cost of DP cases. **[The
\$34,200/yr. cell cost assumes that only 20% of the DP-equivalent LWOP
cases would be in maximum security cost cells and that 80% of the
DP-equivalent LWOP cases would be in average cost cells. A very
conservative estimate. The \$60,000/yr., for those on death row, assumes
that such cells will average a cost equal to 80% of the \$75,000/yr. for
the most expensive maximum security cells. A very high estimate. Even
though we are calculating a 75% greater cell cost for the DP than for
equivalent LWOP cases, equivalent LWOP cases appear to be significantly
more expensive, over time, than their DP counterparts. For years,
opponents have improperly compared the cost of all LWOP cases to DP
cases, when only the DP equivalent LWOP cases are
relevant.]{.underline}**

## AT Innocent Persons Executed

### Potential for saved lives outweighs risk of innocent executions 

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

**[As for the penal system accidentally executing an innocent person, I
must point out that in this imperfect world, nothing that is worth
having comes without risk]{.underline}**. After all, far, **[far more
innocent lives have been taken by convicted murderers than the
supposedly 23 innocents mistakenly executed this century. In fact, there
is absolutely no evidence that the death penalty in this country has
ever executed even ONE innocent in the past century]{.underline}**! Also
consider that **[thousands of American citizens are murdered each year
by released and paroled criminals. These are the serious flaws in life
sentences that abolitionists prefer to trivialize to nonexistence. There
is no doubt whatsoever that keeping murderers alive is far, far more
dangerous to innocents than putting them to death]{.underline}**. One US
Senate report stated this position this way: All that can be expected
of\...\[human authorities\] is that they take every reasonable
precaution against the danger of error\... If errors are\...made, this
is the necessary price that must be paid within a society which is made
up of human beings.

### Risk of future murders justify use even if occasionally innocent 

Wesley Lowe, Novelist, January 17, 2011, Pro Death Penalty,
[http://www.wesleylowe.com/cp.html#contents]{.underline}

For instance, **[abolitionists spend millions of dollars and countless
man hours fighting the legal execution of dozens of our worst human
rights violators per year under the guise that they are concerned about
the innocents that might be executed by mistake, when they do nothing to
eliminate the inhumane parole and probation release policies which
result in the needless injury and slaughter of thousands of innocent
peop]{.underline}**le. This slaughter does not include violent crimes
committed by repeat offenders who are released and who are not on
\"supervision\". And where is the compassion in honoring the previous
victim's suffering and in protecting the human rights of future victims?
Indeed, abolitionist actions show virtually no compassion for the
victims of violent crime or concern for future victims, yet, they
exhibit overwhelming support for those who violate our human rights and
murder countless innocents each year. **[The only time assigning
sanctity to innocent lives can be stomached is when they manipulate
people into preserving murderers. They don\'t value innocent lives at
all, they only refer to them to manipulate those who do. Indeed, their
\"regard\" for innocents is nothing more than a self-righteous
manipulative ploy. So don\'t be fooled by the guise of virtue they tend

**[The employment of lethal force is perhaps the greatest power afforded
a state by its citizens. Thus the death penalty debate is ill-suited for
those who would shrink from the implications of either its deployment or
abrogation. I am opposed to the death penalty. But my opposition is
tempered by the belief that Americans support capital punishment for
real and substantial reasons. The unfortunate fact of humanity is that
it tends to regularly birth butchers who think nothing of concealing
their work beneath a seductive mask of victimhood]{.underline}**
