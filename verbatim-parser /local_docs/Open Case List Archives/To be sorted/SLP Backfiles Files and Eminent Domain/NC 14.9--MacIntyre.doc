}{\plain \fs24 \tab }{\plain \fs28 \fs28 I negate.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 \tab The topic makes a claim about the justice of eminent domain. Thus, before \softline
we can debate on a standards level, the aff has a prima facie burden to prove a \softline
particular conception of justice, since if we don{\u8217\'92}t know what justice is we can{\u8217\'92}t \softline
tell if eminent domain violates it.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 \tab But Alasdair MacIntyre shows that this is impossible: }{\plain \fs28 \fs28 {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 An agent can only \softline
justify a particular judgment by referring to some universal rule from which it may \softline
be }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 logically }{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 derived, and can only justify that rule in turn by deriving it from some more \softline
general rule }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 or principle}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 ;}{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28  but}{\plain \fs28 \fs28  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 on this view }{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 since every chain of reasoning must be finite, such a \softline
process }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 of justificatory reasoning }{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 must always terminate with the assertion of some rule }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 or principle }{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 for \softline
which no further reason can be given}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 . }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Each individual implicitly or explicitly has to adopt his or her own first principles on the basis of such a \softline
choice.  }{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 The utterance of any universal principle is in the end an expression of the \softline
preferences }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 of an individual will }{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 and}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  for that will its principles have and }{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 can have only such authority as [one] }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 it}{\plain \fs28 \fs28  \softline
}{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 chooses to confer }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 up}{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 on [it]}{\plain \fs28 \fs28  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 them by adopting them}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 .{\u8221\'94} Thus, proving claims about justice is \softline
impossible, so you negate.\par

}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 AT {\u8220\'93}Case says meeting burden impossible{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 \tab (1) Any argument that negates the resolution makes the truth of the \softline
resolution logically impossible, since it can{\u8217\'92}t be both true and false at the same \softline
time. It{\u8217\'92}s possible for the aff to meet the burden if s/he refutes MacIntyre. There \softline
are tons of answers to MacIntyre{\u8211\'96}I have five in my expando{\u8211\'96}so that{\u8217\'92}s not an \softline
impossible burden.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 \tab (2) S/he never tells you why fairness trumps the aff{\u8217\'92}s burden to prove the \softline
resolution true. Since the resolution is the only burden set externally to the round, \softline
it{\u8217\'92}s the only basis we have for researching and preparing arguments, meaning that \softline
debating the resolution is prerequisite to both learning and fairness.\par

}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 \tab (1) }{\plain \fs28 \fs28 Since the resolution is the only burden set externally to the round, it{\u8217\'92}s \softline
the only basis we have for researching and preparing arguments, meaning that \softline
without recognition of this burden in round, learning and fairness are precluded \softline
since we can{\u8217\'92}t know what our burden will be going into any given round.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 \tab (2) American Heritage defines {\u8220\'93}affirm{\u8221\'94} as {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 To}{\plain \fs28 \fs28  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 declare positively or firmly; }{\plain \fs28 \ul\fs28 maintain to be \softline
true.}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 {\u8221\'94}}{\plain \fs28 \fs28  Since your ballot tells you to affirm or negate, you can only vote for him/her \softline
if s/he actually does prove the resolution true. This rule of the game trumps all \softline
other theory standards since debate{\u8217\'92}s a game and all games require rules for \softline
determining a winner.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 \tab (3) The entire AC is spent trying to prove the resolution true. S/he{\u8217\'92}s now \softline
claiming that that{\u8217\'92}s not his/her burden, which constitutes blatant advocacy shift \softline
from the AC. If the AC doesn{\u8217\'92}t challenge the default aff burden to prove the \softline
resolution, then that burden provides the only basis for NC strategy. Letting \softline
him/her introduce a new framework into the round in the 1AR destroys fairness by \softline
precluding NC strategy, so you should drop him/her to prevent me from being \softline
excluded from the round.\par

}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 AT {\u8220\'93}Resolution subjectively true/true in terms of arbitrary preferences{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 \tab (1) The notion of subjective truth doesn{\u8217\'92}t make sense, since if truth implies \softline
correspondence of thought and reality then propositions can only be true if they \softline
say something about the things they describe. If {\u8220\'93}Eminent domain is unjust{\u8221\'94} just \softline
expresses by feelings towards eminent domain, it doesn{\u8217\'92}t say anything about an \softline
external reality that I can assess its truth value against{\u8211\'96}it just says something about \softline
me. Thus, viewing the resolution as subjectively true makes no sense.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 \tab (2) Subjective truth undermines the whole notion of debate, since debate{\u8217\'92}s \softline
impossible if all our arguments boil down to arbitrary assertions about our \softline
personal likes and dislikes. Further, it makes adjudication of the round impossible \softline
since you as the judge don{\u8217\'92}t have any way to decide which of our preferences to \softline
favor. Going with whichever one of us you agree with doesn{\u8217\'92}t work both since it \softline
destroys fairness given that neither of us can see inside your head to know what \softline
our burdens are, and since it violates the concept of debate by creating a situation \softline
where the round is decided before either of us start talking. Thus, any of the \softline
benefits of debate are precluded if construe burdens in terms of subjective truths.}}
