}{\plain \fs24 \b A. Holdouts\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab Eminent domain is just since it{\u8217\'92}s the only way to solve the injustices created by holdouts. \softline
Holdouts create injustices in two ways: (1) They force firms or other individuals to pay more \softline
than the fair market value for a given piece of land by exploiting its importance to large-scale \softline
development projects. (2) They can often prevent others in a given neighborhood who would like \softline
to sell their property from doing so. Since most people don{\u8217\'92}t want to move into slums, selling \softline
one{\u8217\'92}s land to private redevelopment firms may be the only way for those living in slums to \softline
escape them. But if one person in a neighborhood refuses to sell, it becomes impossible for \softline
anyone else in the neighborhood to sell either, denying them a chance to escape poverty and thus \softline
failing to give them their due. This is an on-face reason to negate since acts that directly redress \softline
injustice can{\u8217\'92}t be unjust.}{\plain \fs24 \b \par

}{\plain \fs24 \b II. Non-consequential synthetic\par
}{\plain \fs24 \b A. Critical evaluation of rights\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab Eminent domain itself isn{\u8217\'92}t just or unjust since its validity is contingent on the validity of \softline
the prior distribution of rights. Eminent domain is just the transfer of property rights from one \softline
person to another; in other words, it revokes one rights claim in favor of another. Logically, this \softline
is unjust if and only if the original claim is just, since unjust claims shouldn{\u8217\'92}t be recognized in \softline
the first place. Thus, you negate since the fact that a property right is recognized in the status quo \softline
doesn{\u8217\'92}t make it just. Existing distributions of property can be the product of past injustices or \softline
can serve to entrench an unjust balance of social power. In such cases, rejecting eminent domain \softline
impedes the pursuit of justice. For instance, attempts to redistribute land to freed slaves after the \softline
Civil War were stymied by the claim that such action would violate existing property rights, \softline
ignoring the fact that the concentrations of land in the hands of white landowners were the \softline
product of centuries of oppression.}{\plain \fs24 \b \par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab Even if eminent domain is often used in ways that deny legitimate rights claims, in such \softline
cases it{\u8217\'92}s not eminent domain itself that{\u8217\'92}s unjust but the way it{\u8217\'92}s used in those cases, just as the \softline
fact that the state has levied lots of unjust taxes doesn{\u8217\'92}t show that the use of the state{\u8217\'92}s power to \softline
tax is unjust.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab This is an on-face reason to negate since (a) it logically precludes the truth of the \softline
resolution and (b) it indicts the assumption behind the AC that the present distribution of rights \softline
is just.}{\plain \fs24 \b \par
}{\plain \fs24 \b \par
}{\plain \fs24 \b \par
}{\plain \fs24 \b \par
}{\plain \fs24 \b B. Consent\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab State powers can{\u8217\'92}t be unjust if they are consented to by the governed since powers given \softline
to the state voluntarily act as extensions of the natural rights of the people. John Simmons writes: \softline
{\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs24 \ul All political authority is artificial...Governments have the right to limit our liberty...insofar as \softline
they have been granted these rights by us. }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 We, however, possess these rights naturally.}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs24 \ul Governmental rights, are \softline
simply composed of the natural rights of those who becomes citizens, transferred to the \softline
government by some voluntary undertaking}{\plain \fs24 .{\u8221\'94} Thus, the use of eminent domain can{\u8217\'92}t be \softline
inherently unjust since it is just to the extent that the people consent to it. Further, since all \softline
democratic states have some form of eminent domain power, the power of eminent domain has \softline
empirically been consented to by the people.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab The fact that takings are coercive doesn{\u8217\'92}t mean they lack consent, just as we consent to \softline
tax policies or laws that are inherently coercive since they{\u8217\'92}re backed up by the threat of force.\par

}{\plain \fs24 \b C. MacIntyre\par
}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 \tab }{\plain \fs24 The topic makes a claim about the justice of eminent domain. Thus, before we can debate \softline
on a standards level, the aff has a prima facie burden to prove a particular conception of justice, \softline
since if we don{\u8217\'92}t know what justice is we can{\u8217\'92}t tell if eminent domain violates it. But Alasdair \softline
MacIntyre shows that this is impossible: }{\plain \fs24 {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs24 \ul An agent can only justify a particular judgment by \softline
referring to some universal rule from which it may be }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 logically }{\plain \fs24 \ul derived, and can only justify that rule \softline
in turn by deriving it from some more general rule }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 or principle}{\plain \fs24 ;}{\plain \fs24 \ul  but}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 on this view }{\plain \fs24 \ul since every chain of \softline
reasoning must be finite, such a process }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 of justificatory reasoning }{\plain \fs24 \ul must always terminate with the assertion of \softline
some rule }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 or principle }{\plain \fs24 \ul for which no further reason can be given}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 . }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Each individual implicitly or explicitly has to adopt his or her own first \softline
principles on the basis of such a choice.  }{\plain \fs24 \ul The utterance of any universal principle is in the end an expression of the \softline
preferences }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 of an individual will }{\plain \fs24 \ul and}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  for that will its principles have and }{\plain \fs24 \ul can have only such authority as [one] }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 it }{\plain \fs24 \ul chooses to \softline
confer }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 up}{\plain \fs24 \ul on [it]}{\plain \fs28 \fs28  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 them by adopting them}{\plain \fs28 \fs28 .}{\plain \fs24 {\u8221\'94} Thus, proving claims about justice is impossible. This is an on-face \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \b D. Wittgenstein\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab The resolution can never be true since concepts of justice don{\u8217\'92}t correspond to anything in \softline
the external world. Ludwig Wittgenstein writes: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Now what I wish to contend is that, although all judgments of relative value can be shown to \softline
be mere statements of facts,}{\plain \fs12 \ul\fs12  }{\plain \fs24 \ul no statement of fact can ever be, or imply, a judgment of absolute value. }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Let me explain this: \softline
}{\plain \fs24 \ul Suppose}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 one of }{\plain \fs24 \ul you were }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 an }{\plain \fs24 \ul omniscient}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 person }{\plain \fs24 \ul and}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  therefore }{\plain \fs24 \ul knew all the movements of all the bodies in the \softline
world }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 dead or alive }{\plain \fs24 \ul and}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  that he also knew }{\plain \fs24 \ul all the states of mind of all human beings that ever lived, and }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 suppose this man}{\plain \fs12 \ul\fs12  \softline
}{\plain \fs24 \ul wrote all [this]}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 he knew }{\plain \fs24 \ul in a big book, then this book would contain the whole description of the \softline
world; and [yet] }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 what I want to say is, that }{\plain \fs24 \ul this book would contain nothing that we would call and }{\plain \fs24 \i\ul ethical}{\plain \fs24 \ul  \softline
judgment or anything that would logically imply such a judgment}{\plain \fs24 .{\u8221\'94} Thus, the resolution can \softline
never be true since if concepts of justice lack reference it{\u8217\'92}s impossible for anything to violate \softline
them. This is an on-face reason to negate since it logically precludes the truth of the resolution.}{\plain \fs24 \b \par

}{\plain \fs24 \b III. Analytic\par
}{\plain \fs24 \b A. Eminent domain incompatible with private enterprise\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab American Heritage defines {\u8220\'93}private enterprise{\u8221\'94} as {\u8220\'93}business activities unregulated by \softline
state ownership and control.{\u8221\'94} Thus, {\u8220\'93}the use of eminent domain to promote private enterprise is \softline
a contradiction in terms since eminent domain asserts state control over private firms, meaning \softline
both that private enterprise can never coexist with the use of eminent domain and that even if it \softline
could the use of eminent domain would always harm rather than promote it by making it less \softline
private.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab Two impacts: (1) You negate on a logical level since affirming affirms a contradiction. \softline
(2) If the use of eminent domain to promote private enterprise can{\u8217\'92}t exist, it can{\u8217\'92}t be unjust. Both \softline
these impacts are a priori since they make the truth of the resolution logically impossible.}{\plain \fs24 \b \par

}{\plain \fs24 \b B. State not a moral agent\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab American Heritage defines {\u8220\'93}justice{\u8221\'94} as {\u8220\'93}conformity to moral rightness.{\u8221\'94} Since justice is a \softline
moral concept, state action can{\u8217\'92}t be just or unjust since moral evaluation of state action is \softline
impossible for two reasons: (1) Morality can only apply to persons since moral evaluation \softline
presupposes choice and intentionality. An avalanche that kills a bunch of people would be bad \softline
but we wouldn{\u8217\'92}t call it immoral since it didn{\u8217\'92}t choose to happen. The state is just an institutional \softline
tool for implementing the choices of particular persons, none of whom personally embody the \softline
state. State actions are thus predetermined by external factors and can{\u8217\'92}t be just or unjust. (2) \softline
Even the acts of particular policy-makers aren{\u8217\'92}t freely chosen, since (a) they{\u8217\'92}re bound by legal \softline
constraints and duties and (b) they lack meaningful autonomy in their role as policy-makers \softline
since they can be removed from office and replaced if they fail to satisfy the wants of their \softline
constituents, making them just another level of institutional mechanism.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab Thus, you negate since eminent domain as a category of state action can{\u8217\'92}t be labeled just \softline
or unjust. This is a priori since it makes the truth of the resolution logically impossible.}{\plain \fs24 \b \par
