}{\plain \fs24 \b 1. Andre and Valasquez\par
}{\plain \fs24 \b \tab }{\plain \fs24 Eminent domain by definition presupposes a conception of {\u8220\'93}public use{\u8221\'94} that defines the \softline
limits of the takings power. Such a standard requires the state to make value judgement about \softline
concepts of the good to determine what counts as a public use, and to privilege a single of \softline
conception of the common good as the goal of public utility. Claire Andre and Manuel Valasquez \softline
explain [}{\plain \fs24 \i two ways in which}{\plain \fs24 ] this is unjust: }{\plain \fs24 {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs24 \ul First, }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 according to some philosophers, }{\plain \fs24 \ul the very idea of a common \softline
good is inconsistent with a pluralistic society }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 like ours. }{\plain \fs24 \ul Different people have different ideas abut \softline
what }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 is worthwhile or what }{\plain \fs24 \ul constitutes {\u8216\'91}the good life for human beings,{\u8217\'92} differences that have increased}{\plain \fs12 \ul\fs12  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 during \softline
the last few decades }{\plain \fs24 \ul as the voices of }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 more and more }{\plain \fs24 \ul previously silenced groups, such as women and minorities \softline
have been heard. Given these differences}{\plain \fs24 , }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 some people urge, it will be impossible for us to agree on what particular kind of social systems, institutions, \softline
and environment we will all pitch in to support. And even if we agree upon what we all valued, we would certainly disagree about the relative values things have for us. While a may agree, for \softline
example, that an affordable health system a healthy educational system, and a clean environment are all parts of the common good, some will say the, more should be invested in health than in \softline
education, while others will favor directing resources to the environment over both health and education. Such disagreements are bound to undercut our ability to evoke a sustained and widespread \softline
commitment to the common good. In the face of such pluralism, }{\plain \fs24 \ul efforts to bring about the common good can only lead to \softline
adopting or promoting the views of some, while excluding others, violating the principle of \softline
treating people equally. Moreover, such efforts would force everyone to support some specific \softline
notion of the common good, violating the freedom of those who do not share in that goal, and \softline
inevitably leading to paternalism }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 (imposing one group's preference on others), }{\plain \fs24 \ul tyranny, and oppression}{\plain \fs24 .{\u8221\'94} {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Finally, }{\plain \fs24 \ul [Second,] \softline
appeals to the common good are confronted by the problem of an unequal sharing of burdens. \softline
Maintaining a common good often requires that [some persons]}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 particular individuals }{\plain \fs24 \ul or}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  particular }{\plain \fs24 \ul groups bear \softline
costs}{\plain \fs12 \ul\fs12  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 that are much}{\plain \fs12 \ul\fs12  }{\plain \fs24 \ul greater than those borne by others}{\plain \fs24 .}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  Maintaining an unpolluted environment, for example, may require that particular firms that pollute \softline
install costly pollution control devices, undercutting profits. Making employment opportunities more equal may require that some groups, such as white males, sacrifice their own employment \softline
chances. Making the health system affordable and accessible to all may require that insurers accept lower premiums, that physicians accept lower salaries, or that those with particularly costly \softline
diseases or conditions forego the medical treatment on which their lives depend. }{\plain \fs24 \ul Forcing particular groups or individuals to carry such \softline
unequal burdens {\u8216\'91}for the sake of the common good,{\u8217\'92} is}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 , }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 at least arguably, }{\plain \fs24 \ul unjust}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 . }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Moreover, the prospect of having to carry such heavy 
and unequal burdens leads }{\plain \fs24 \ul [and will lead] such groups and individuals to resist any attempts to secure common \softline
goods.}{\plain \fs24 {\u8221\'94} Eminent domain links into this problem with the concept of a {\u8220\'93}common good{\u8221\'94} in \softline
particular since it imposes disproportionate burdens on a small group of property owners.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab This is an on-face reasons to affirm, since the procedural requirements of eminent domain \softline
inherently privilege some viewpoints over others, failing to give each citizen the equal treatment \softline
they are due from the government and justifying further violations of rights.}{\plain \fs24 \b \par

}{\plain \fs24 \b 2. Procedural bias\par
}{\plain \fs24 \b \tab }{\plain \fs24 For eminent domain to be even potentially just, the takings process must contain \softline
mechanisms to ensure that all interests are fairly represented, since if some people{\u8217\'92}s interests are \softline
privileged over others those at the bottom will never be given their due. Thus, the neg has a \softline
prima facie burden to prove that the takings process isn{\u8217\'92}t biased in favor of some parties to the \softline
taking. Unfortunately, it is [}{\plain \fs24 \i in two/three ways}{\plain \fs24 ]}{\plain \fs24 \b :\par
}{\plain \fs24 \b \tab }{\plain \fs24 First, large firms have disproportionate power in both the legislative and the legal arenas. \softline
They have more money to lobby for their causes, to hire lawyers, and to sustain lengthy appeals. \softline
Even non-profits like the Institute for Justice lack anything like the resources of a large firm like \softline
GM, meaning that the takings process will always favor the firm seeking the taking over \softline
individual landowners.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab }{\plain \fs24 Second, property owners effected by eminent domain actions are unable to effectively \softline
organize and make their voices heard politically. Thus, even the decisions well-intentioned and \softline
unbiased government bodies will not fairly represent their interests. Stephen Jones writes: \softline
{\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs24 \ul Unlike the normal political process}{\plain \fs24 , }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 in which various interests compete within a representative framework, }{\plain \fs24 \ul dispossessed property \softline
owners are unable to organize effectively to challenge condemnations. This fact is attributable to \softline
both the transient nature of the condemnation and the condemnee's veritable isolation}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Certainly, Vera \softline
Coking and her neighbors have no galvanizing basis for a long-term alliance. }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Furthermore, even if a condemnee could organize and lobby for her cause, she will lack the wherewithal to compete \softline
with powerful special interests }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 such as Trump. }{\plain \fs24 \ul In addition, most politicians favor economic development and will \softline
probably vote in favor of a development project at the expense of a dispossessed few}{\plain \fs24 .{\u8221\'94} Thus, \softline
since it{\u8217\'92}s easier for firms to coordinate their political efforts, the takings process structurally \softline
privileges them over landowners.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab Third, the takings process is procedurally biased against the poor and racial minorities. 
Donald Kochan [}{\plain \fs24 \i of the 6}{\plain \fs24 \i\super th}{\plain \fs24 \i  Circuit Court of Appeals}{\plain \fs24 ] writes [}{\plain \fs24 \i in the Texas Review of Law and \softline
Politics, 1998, that}{\plain \fs24 ]: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs24 \ul {\u8216\'91}Slum{\u8217\'92} clearance under the condemnation power disproportionately affects \softline
the poor, who are more likely to live in these neighborhoods and be ousted from their homes by \softline
clearance. Similarly}{\plain \fs24 , }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Bovard contends that }{\plain \fs24 \ul historic preservation statutes limiting property uses have become \softline
{\u8216\'91}a tool for racial discrimination{\u8211\'96}a strategy to drive up housing prices and drive out poor people.}{\plain \fs24 {\u8217\'92} \softline
}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 He also illustrates how these limitations on property rights have impeded religious freedoms...}{\plain \fs24 \ul As one example}{\plain \fs24 , }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Bovard reported that }{\plain \fs24 \ul the Department of \softline
Housing and Urban Development concluded that an Arlington, Virginia decision to designate a \softline
fifty- block black neighborhood as a historic district {\u8216\'91}was specifically intended to displace low- \softline
and moderate-income blacks{\u8217\'92} from their homes {\u8216\'91}in order to }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 upgrade properties [and] ... to promote the rise of property values and \softline
}{\plain \fs24 \ul attract}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 ion of }{\plain \fs24 \ul new residents.}{\plain \fs24 {\u8217\'92}{\u8221\'94} Thus, eminent doma}{\plain \fs24 in deprives economically and racially \softline
marginalized groups of their due.\par

}{\plain \fs24 \b 3. Rhetoric of blight\par
}{\plain \fs24 \ul0 \tab The use of eminent domain to promote private enterprise is unjust since it{\u8217\'92}s steeped in the \softline
racist discourse of blight. Pritchett in {\u8216\'91}03: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs24 \ul To secure political }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 and judicial }{\plain \fs24 \ul approval for their efforts, \softline
renewal advocates created a new language of urban decline: a discourse of blight}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Blight, renewal proponents \softline
argued, was a disease that threatened to turn healthy areas into slums.}{\plain \fs12 \ul\fs12  }{\plain \fs24 \ul A vague, amorphous term}{\plain \fs24 \ul , blight was a rhetorical device that \softline
enabled renewal advocates to reorganize property ownership by declaring certain real estate \softline
dangerous to the future of the city.}{\plain \fs24 {\u8221\'94} {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs24 \ul Blight was a facially neutral term infused with racial and \softline
ethnic prejudice. While it purportedly assessed the state of urban infrastructure, blight was often \softline
used to describe the negative impact of certain residents on city neighborhoods. This {\u8216\'91}scientific{\u8217\'92} \softline
method of understanding urban decline was used to justify the removal of blacks and other \softline
minorities from certain parts of the city. By selecting racially changing neighborhoods as blighted \softline
areas and designating them for redevelopment, the urban renewal program enabled institutional \softline
and political elites to relocate minority populations and entrench racial segregation. }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Berman was decided just \softline
six months after Brown v. Board of Education, but while Brown receives more attention, Berman was equally influential in shaping American race relations. The }{\plain \fs24 \ul urban renewal \softline
}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 program }{\plain \fs24 \ul played a crucial role in redistributing urban populations and creating additional obstacles to\sect \sectd \sbknone\headery1440\footery1440\endnhere\endnhere

 \softline
efforts to achieve integration}{\plain \fs24 .{\u8221\'94} Thus, the use of eminent domain to promote private enterprise is \softline
rationalized through rhetoric that masks racial bias, and serves as a tool for discriminatory \softline
redevelopment policies, making it unjust.\par

}{\plain \fs24 \b 4. Economics}{\plain \fs24 \par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab For the use of eminent domain to promote private enterprise to ever be just, it must \softline
minimally be effective since if it fails to promote private enterprise it violates property rights \softline
without adequate justification, violates the state{\u8217\'92}s obligations to its citizens by harming their \softline
material well-being, and exceeds the just limits of state power by using a power for something \softline
other than its democratically sanctioned purpose. Thus, if the neg can{\u8217\'92}t prove that eminent \softline
domain actually promotes private enterprise, you vote aff on face. Unfortunately for him/her, s/he \softline
can{\u8217\'92}t for several reasons:\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab }{\plain \fs24 (1) Takings  harm the economy since it makes firms spend money on gaining political \softline
influence rather than production and research. Since firms have to make sure that their land \softline
doesn{\u8217\'92}t get taken and that they benefit from takings as much as their rivals to stay competitive, \softline
they have to waste money on zero-sum political games.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (2) Takings harm the economy since they advantage the most politically powerful firms \softline
instead of the most efficient and economically productive. This destroys market mechanisms that \softline
maximize efficiency.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (3) Cities have incentives to sell land to firms at less than the market price to keep them \softline
from going elsewhere. But this promotes bad investments since if firms don{\u8217\'92}t pay full price for \softline
the land they don{\u8217\'92}t need to recover its market value and can use it inefficiently without losing \softline
money.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (4) Takings force condemnees and firms to waste money on huge court battles. Since \softline
lawsuits aren{\u8217\'92}t economically productive, this harms growth.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (5) Takings destroys competitive pressures towards efficiency. Takings to promote \softline
private enterprise always favor the larger firm since they can bring more resources and hire more 
people. Thus, takings make large firms more secure against competition from small ones, \softline
lessening incentives to improve efficiency to stay ahead.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (6) Takings promote wasteful investment. Since takings are proposed publically and go \softline
through a process of political debate as well as a required negotiation process, landowners know \softline
that their land will be taken well before it is and have incentives to overinvest in it to increase \softline
their compensation. Calandrillo in {\u8216\'91}03: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 One of the primary detractions of government payment of just compensation outlined above is that \softline
}{\plain \fs24 \ul guaranteed}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 state-}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 based }{\plain \fs24 \ul reimbursement for takings distorts a landowner's decision regarding whether }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 or not \softline
}{\plain \fs24 \ul to improve her property. Since she knows that the government must pay }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 her for }{\plain \fs24 \ul the}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 full and fair }{\plain \fs24 \ul market \softline
value of her land (and any improvements to it), she may often proceed with renovations where \softline
they would clearly be socially undesirable}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Recall the example discussed in Part III.B.1: }{\plain \fs24 \ul [For instance,] a $ 1 million \softline
renovation would yield an increase in property value of $ 1.5 million, but would be demolished}{\plain \fs24  \softline
}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 with probability equal to 50% }{\plain \fs24 \ul if the [taking]  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 government }{\plain \fs24 \ul went forward }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 with a potential public transportation project}{\plain \fs24 .{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (7) Since takings only happen when landowners won{\u8217\'92}t sell for the market price, firms \softline
would pay more for the land on the market. Further, lots of firms can compete for valuable land \softline
on the market, driving up prices. This extra spending would put more money into the economy, \softline
boosting growth, and would ensure that the land is put to the most efficient use since a firm \softline
would only pay the higher price if it expected to make a greater profit.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (8) Since {\u8220\'93}just compensation{\u8221\'94} doesn{\u8217\'92}t account for things like moving costs and lost \softline
business ties, cities don{\u8217\'92}t bear the full cost of takings and thus have incentives for inefficient uses \softline
of the takings power. Epstein notes: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 To start with the obvious point first, }{\plain \fs24 \ul the conscious decisions of the Supreme \softline
Court to short-change the compensation formula means that government officials always face the \softline
wrong set of prices}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 every time they resort to the condemnation power, even when it is undoubtedly for public use}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs24 \ul Here is a simple}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  numerical }{\plain \fs24 \ul example}{\plain \fs24  \softline
}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 of how it plays out}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs24 \ul The total losses inflicted on the private owner are $ 10,000. The gain to the 
municipality}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 and its other citizens }{\plain \fs24 \ul is $ 8,000. The price required of the state is only $ 5,000. The rational \softline
government official compares the last two numbers}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 and charges ahead}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs24 \ul Its $ 3,000 gain}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  (the value of the property in public \softline
hands less the condemnation price}{\plain \fs24 ) }{\plain \fs24 \ul is duly registered, and the $5,000 loss to the owner}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 (total loss less condemnation proceeds received) }{\plain \fs24 \ul is \softline
}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 wholly}{\plain \fs24 \ul  ignored}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 The law treats a transaction that creates a net social loss of $ 2,000 as though it created a net social gain of $ 3,000.}{\plain \fs24 {\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (9) Takings destroy incentives for good investment in two ways: First, firms are afraid of \softline
having their land taken and have less reason for long-term investment in it. Second, firms are \softline
afraid of losing returns on their investment to state-favored competition. Ackerman in {\u8216\'91}04: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Although \softline

basic standards of supply and demand recognize that market prices diminish when demand is \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \tab (10) Forced dislocations of large numbers of people harm the economy by disrupting \softline
market equilibria and creating unemployment, harming long-term growth. Cities have no reason \softline
to take these harms into account since they don{\u8217\'92}t have to deal with the people they{\u8217\'92}re displacing.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (11) Takings harm growth by increasing state spending and thus taxes. The harms of \softline
taxation will always outweigh the benefits of takings on timeframe, since they happen \softline
immediately, and on scale since they effect everyone. Cities won{\u8217\'92}t take them into account since \softline
the benefits are more concentrated and visible, making them more politically important.}}
