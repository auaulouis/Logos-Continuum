}{\plain \fs24 \b 1. AT {\u8220\'93}One just use{\u8221\'94} burden.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (1) Almost any broad normative claim will be true in some cases and false in others. \softline
Thus, burdening the aff to argue every single instance of the topic destroys debate since it frames \softline
topics in a way that makes them indisputably false. This is the biggest possible impact to any \softline
theory standard since the potential for debate is prerequisite for all other goals of the activity.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (2) His/her interpretation of burdens destroys AC strategy, since I can{\u8217\'92}t know what cases \softline
of eminent domain the NC will defend and I can{\u8217\'92}t cover even a small fraction of all eminent \softline
domain cases in a six-minute AC. That destroys fairness since it steals almost half my speech \softline
time. Fairness is a voter since debate{\u8217\'92}s a game and no one wants to play a game that{\u8217\'92}s rigged.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (3) His/her framework destroys fairness on another level since it explodes research \softline
burdens by forcing me to research every single taking in history to prepare for the round if I want \softline
good answers in the 1AR. Since this research burden is impossible, it prevents me from \softline
preparing for round. It also destroys education since it negates any incentive to do affirmative \softline
research or to research more general topic literature. Learning is a voter since it{\u8217\'92}s the goal of \softline
debate and the reason schools fund it.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab You can sign your ballot on this abuse for two reasons: (a) Voting here discourages other \softline
debaters from using arguments that harm learning and fairness in future. (b) Since his/her \softline
framework precludes debate, it skews my time and deprives us of topic learning my forcing me to \softline
run theory in the 1AR rather than talking about arguments.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (4) To win that the example of eminent domain s/he gives you in the NC is just, s/he has \softline
to show that it doesn{\u8217\'92}t bite into the general problems with takings discussed in the AC. Unless \softline
s/he shows why each my arguments don{\u8217\'92}t apply to the case s/he presents, that case is still unjust \softline
and you affirm.\par

}{\plain \fs24 \b 2. AT {\u8220\'93}Eminent domain neither just nor unjust{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab All the arguments in the NC claiming that eminent domain is neither just nor unjust are \softline
on-face reasons to affirm. The neg is burdened to show that eminent domain is just for two \softline
reasons: First, the prefix {\u8220\'93}un{\u8221\'94} implies negation, so {\u8220\'93}X is not just{\u8221\'94} is semantically equivalent to \softline
{\u8220\'93}X is unjust{\u8221\'94}. Second, fair division of ground requires that the neg advocate the converse of the \softline
resolution. If I have to say that eminent domain is unjust but s/he can say that it{\u8217\'92}s either just or \softline
neither, s/he has twice my ground for research and argumentation, exacerbating the neg{\u8217\'92}s \softline
structural advantage based on speech times. Since debate{\u8217\'92}s a game, fairness is a constraint.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab Since s/he concedes in the NC that eminent domain{\u8217\'92}s not just, you affirm on face. This \softline
functions as a straight turn on [identify arguments claiming that eminent domain is neither just \softline
nor unjust] and a takeout on the rest of his/her offense since s/he can{\u8217\'92}t argue that eminent domain \softline
is just when s/he{\u8217\'92}s already conceded that it{\u8217\'92}s not.\par

}{\plain \fs24 \b 1. AT Alasdair MacIntyre\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (1) MacIntyre{\u8217\'92}s argument isn{\u8217\'92}t unique to normative claims. If all chains of reasoning are \softline
finite and terminate in unprovable assertions, then no more possible to prove positive claims \softline
objectively than normative ones. The impacts are that: (a) If you buy MacIntyre, you can never \softline
negate since you can never have solid grounds for believing that propositions like {\u8220\'93}The neg won \softline
the round{\u8221\'94} or {\u8220\'93}I should negate{\u8221\'94} are true; (b) You can{\u8217\'92}t buy MacIntyre, since his own argument \softline
terminates in assertions, for instance the assertion that all chains of reasoning must be finite, so \softline
by his own logic you have no grounds for buying his conclusion.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (2) We accept arguments ending in assertions all the time if those assertions are self-evident. For instance, I don{\u8217\'92}t think the sky is blue because it{\u8217\'92}s logically entailed by a set of \softline
premises I accept{\u8211\'96}I believe it because when I look outside, the sky is self-evidently blue. Thus, \softline
basing arguments on terminal assertions doesn{\u8217\'92}t make those arguments invalid.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (3) The impact of MacIntyre is just that logically complete proofs of normative claims are \softline
impossible. But my burden in the round isn{\u8217\'92}t to prove eminent domain unjust from a set of \softline
ontological axioms, since it would be impossible to do that in six minutes. The only way be can \softline
debate real-world topics within a reasonable timeframe is by appealing to commonly held \softline
intuitions about justice, for instance that arbitrarily favoring some groups over others or violating \softline
basic rights is bad. If the neg wants to challenge those assumptions, s/he can, but requiring me to \softline
prove them ontologically true in a six-minute speech is absurd. Thus, there{\u8217\'92}s nothing wrong with \softline
me introducing asserted premises about justice into the round.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (4) MacIntyre ignores the fact that there are multiple kinds of truth. In particular, \softline
ontological truth of the sort ascribed to things like logic and math is distinct from the subjective \softline
truth of things like esthetic judgments. We accept subjective truths all the time{\u8211\'96}for instance, if I \softline
way {\u8220\'93}The Mona Lisa is a pretty painting,{\u8221\'94} we wouldn{\u8217\'92}t say that my claim is false because \softline
someone else might think it{\u8217\'92}s not pretty. Similarly, even if ethical claims just express subjective \softline
preference they can still be subjectively true for a given person if it follows from basic \softline
assumptions about justice that they personally accept. Thus, if I prove that eminent domain \softline
violates something that you see as a rule of justice, the resolution is true for you and you should \softline
affirm. This standard doesn{\u8217\'92}t greatly undermine the predictability of decisions since just about \softline
everyone agrees on some basic claims about justice, like the claims that slavery and genocide are \softline
bad.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (5) The aff isn{\u8217\'92}t necessarily bound to prove anything about justice. If I show that the \softline
takings process is structurally incapable of giving each their due regardless of what that is, that{\u8217\'92}s \softline
a purely factual claim and thus doesn{\u8217\'92}t bite into MacIntyre{\u8217\'92}s argument. [Show where you do this \softline
on the flow] Thus, even if it{\u8217\'92}s impossible for me to prove anything about the nature of justice I \softline
can still affirm.\par

}{\plain \fs24 \b 2. AT Friedrich Nietzsche\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (1) The Nietzsche evidence is absolutely unwarranted. If you don{\u8217\'92}t have a clear warrant \softline
on your flow from the NC, don{\u8217\'92}t vote on the argument since it{\u8217\'92}s not fair to expect me to respond \softline
to arguments that aren{\u8217\'92}t clearly articulated. If you{\u8217\'92}re not sure about warranting, read Nietzsche \softline
after the round{\u8211\'96}it{\u8217\'92}s just a string of fancy-sounding descriptive assertions.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (2) Nietzsche just gives a genealogical account of where moral concepts come from. The \softline
fact that these concepts arose in a particular way doesn{\u8217\'92}t determine the validity of claims about \softline
ethics. All concepts are capable of being twisted to serve self-interested goals; that doesn{\u8217\'92}t make \softline
them empty.\par

}{\plain \fs24 \b 3. AT Ludwig Wittgenstein: {\u8220\'93}Ethics claims lack reference.{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (1) The card is blatantly unwarranted. Wittgenstein never actually proves that ethical \softline
claims can{\u8217\'92}t have reference; he just rants about a guy with a big book.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (2) Wittgenstein begs the question by assuming that a complete description of the world \softline
wouldn{\u8217\'92}t include any ethical truths. There{\u8217\'92}s no reason why the physical relationships between \softline
bodies necessarily has to be exhaustive of all the information in the universe.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (3) There is all sorts of information that we consider meaningful that wouldn{\u8217\'92}t be \softline
included in a complete description of the physical universe. For instance, I could know the \softline
positions of every physical body at every point in time and still not know the laws of physics that \softline
govern them. I would have to derive that from the information I had been given.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (4) Just as we can derive general physical laws from descriptions of the universe, we can \softline
derive normative propositions from our factual knowledge. For instance, a complete factual \softline
history of the Holocaust wouldn{\u8217\'92}t include any normative propositions, but we could derive an \softline
ethical judgement from the facts presented.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (5) Since we understand what is meant by ethical claims, they must have reference to \softline
something within our experience. For instance, some people argue that ethical claims refer to the \softline
phenomena of pleasure and pain. Since these phenomena are objectively real, they would have to \softline
be included in Wittgenstein{\u8217\'92}s book.\par

}{\plain \fs24 \b 4. AT Ludwig Wittgenstein: {\u8220\'93}Ethical claims rely on simile.{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (1) The claim that we can only express ethical claims through simile is ridiculous. If I say \softline
{\u8220\'93}Genocide is unjust,{\u8221\'94} that{\u8217\'92}s not a simile, but you still know what I mean. The resolution is also a \softline
normative claim, and there aren{\u8217\'92}t any similes in it either.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (2) Even if there we could only express normative claims through simile, that would be a \softline
defect of our language, not of ethics. Since we intuitively understand what is meant by ethical \softline
claims, at least in terms of what behaviors they enjoin on us, ethical concepts can{\u8217\'92}t be empty. \softline
Lacking the language the express them properly doesn{\u8217\'92}t change that. [}{\plain \fs24 \i Wittgenstein was the one \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \b 1. AT {\u8220\'93}Eminent domain promotes economic development.{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (1) Eminent domain isn{\u8217\'92}t needed for land assembly since secret buyers can solve for \softline
holdouts. If people don{\u8217\'92}t know that a large firm needs their land they have no reason to expect \softline
that holding out would lead to a better price. Without holdouts, takings are never needed since \softline
people will sell voluntarily, which by definition isn{\u8217\'92}t eminent domain.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (2) Eminent domain also isn{\u8217\'92}t needed since collective bargaining with landowners can \softline
solve for holdouts too. If everyone gets a fair market price and no one can person can hold out for \softline
more landowners have no reason not to sell.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (3) Eminent domain isn{\u8217\'92}t needed on a third level since the threat of takings is just as \softline
effective. If having my land seized will just get me the market price and a firm offers me five \softline
percent more, I have an incentive to sell rather than hold out.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (4) Even if eminent domain makes one place richer, it won{\u8217\'92}t produce any net gain. The \softline
poor people that get kicked out or can{\u8217\'92}t afford to live in the richer neighborhood have to go \softline
somewhere, and the richer people who replace them have to come from somewhere. That means \softline
eminent domain at best just transfers poverty from one place to another. This does three things: \softline
(1) It takes out the link to all neg benefits stemming from development. (2) It makes all empirics \softline
about the positive effects of eminent domain meaningless since they don{\u8217\'92}t account for the \softline
transfer of poverty. (3) It turns all neg development impacts since takings spend tax dollars for no \softline
return.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab The rest are turns:\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (5) Takings  harm the economy since it makes firms spend money on gaining political \softline
influence rather than production and research. Since firms have to make sure that their land \softline
doesn{\u8217\'92}t get taken and that they benefit from takings as much as their rivals to stay competitive, \softline
they have to waste money on zero-sum political games.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (6) Takings harm the economy since they advantage the most politically powerful firms \softline
instead of the most efficient and economically productive. This destroys market mechanisms that \softline
maximize efficiency.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (7) Cities have incentives to sell land to firms at less than the market price to keep them \softline
from going elsewhere. But this promotes bad investments since if firms don{\u8217\'92}t pay full price for \softline
the land they don{\u8217\'92}t need to recover its market value and can use it inefficiently without losing \softline
money.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (8) Takings force condemnees and firms to waste money on huge court battles. Since \softline
lawsuits aren{\u8217\'92}t economically productive, this harms growth.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (9) Takings destroys competitive pressures towards efficiency. Takings to promote \softline
private enterprise always favor the larger firm since they can bring more resources and hire more \softline
people. Thus, takings make large firms more secure against competition from small ones, \softline
lessening incentives to improve efficiency to stay ahead.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (10) Takings promote wasteful investment. Since takings are proposed publically and go \softline
through a process of political debate as well as a required negotiation process, landowners know \softline
that their land will be taken well before it is and have incentives to overinvest in it to increase \softline
their compensation. Calandrillo in {\u8216\'91}03: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 One of the primary detractions of government payment of just compensation outlined above is that \softline
}{\plain \fs24 \ul guaranteed}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 state-}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 based }{\plain \fs24 \ul reimbursement for takings distorts a landowner's decision regarding whether }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 or not 
}{\plain \fs24 \ul to improve her property. Since she knows that the government must pay }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 her for }{\plain \fs24 \ul the}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 full and fair }{\plain \fs24 \ul market \softline
value of her land (and any improvements to it), she may often proceed with renovations where \softline
they would clearly be socially undesirable}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Recall the example discussed in Part III.B.1: }{\plain \fs24 \ul [For instance,] a $ 1 million \softline
renovation would yield an increase in property value of $ 1.5 million, but would be demolished}{\plain \fs24  \softline
}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 with probability equal to 50% }{\plain \fs24 \ul if the [taking]  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 government }{\plain \fs24 \ul went forward }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 with a potential public transportation project}{\plain \fs24 .{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (11) Since takings only happen when landowners won{\u8217\'92}t sell for the market price, firms \softline
would pay more for the land on the market. Further, lots of firms can compete for valuable land \softline
on the market, driving up prices. This extra spending would put more money into the economy, \softline
boosting growth, and would ensure that the land is put to the most efficient use since a firm \softline
would only pay the higher price if it expected to make a greater profit.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (12) Since {\u8220\'93}just compensation{\u8221\'94} doesn{\u8217\'92}t account for things like moving costs and lost \softline
business ties, cities don{\u8217\'92}t bear the full cost of takings and thus have incentives for inefficient uses \softline
of the takings power. Epstein notes: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 To start with the obvious point first, }{\plain \fs24 \ul the conscious decisions of the Supreme \softline
Court to short-change the compensation formula means that government officials always face the \softline
wrong set of prices}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 every time they resort to the condemnation power, even when it is undoubtedly for public use}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs24 \ul Here is a simple}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  numerical }{\plain \fs24 \ul example}{\plain \fs24  \softline
}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 of how it plays out}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs24 \ul The total losses inflicted on the private owner are $ 10,000. The gain to the \softline
municipality}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 and its other citizens }{\plain \fs24 \ul is $ 8,000. The price required of the state is only $ 5,000. The rational \softline
government official compares the last two numbers}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 and charges ahead}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs24 \ul Its $ 3,000 gain}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  (the value of the property in public \softline
hands less the condemnation price}{\plain \fs24 ) }{\plain \fs24 \ul is duly registered, and the $5,000 loss to the owner}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 (total loss less condemnation proceeds received) }{\plain \fs24 \ul is \softline
}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 wholly}{\plain \fs24 \ul  ignored}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 The law treats a transaction that creates a net social loss of $ 2,000 as though it created a net social gain of $ 3,000.}{\plain \fs24 {\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (13) Takings destroy incentives for good investment in two ways: First, firms are afraid of \softline
having their land taken and have less reason for long-term investment in it. Second, firms are 
afraid of losing returns on their investment to state-favored competition. Ackerman in {\u8216\'91}04: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 Although \softline
seemingly beneficial, }{\plain \fs24 \ul [Eminent domain]}{\plain \fs24 , }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 whereby the city views itself as the }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 {\u8216\'91}honest broker,}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 {\u8217\'92} }{\plain \fs24 \ul destroys the supply-demand market. The \softline
basic standards of supply and demand recognize that market prices diminish when demand is \softline
artificially limited. Entities have no interest in seeking out properties and creating a market}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 for viable \softline
development }{\plain \fs24 \ul so long as the}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 reasonable }{\plain \fs24 \ul investor fears a third-party developer will obtain City assistance}{\plain \fs24 , }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 be it \softline
acquisition }{\plain \fs24 \ul by condemnation or tax abatements not available to the first developer}{\plain \fs24 .{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (14) Forced dislocations of large numbers of people harm the economy by disrupting \softline
market equilibria and creating unemployment, harming long-term growth. Cities have no reason \softline
to take these harms into account since they don{\u8217\'92}t have to deal with the people they{\u8217\'92}re displacing.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (15) Takings harm growth by increasing state spending and thus taxes. The harms of \softline
taxation will always outweigh the benefits of takings on timeframe, since they happen \softline
immediately, and on scale since they effect everyone. Cities won{\u8217\'92}t take them into account since \softline
the benefits are more concentrated and visible, making them more politically important.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (16) State efforts to promote private enterprise always harm the economy on balance \softline
since they replace more efficient market outcomes. The self-interest of investors serves to \softline
allocate funds to the most profitable enterprises; since state policy-makers don{\u8217\'92}t have to consider \softline
profit and loss, they aren{\u8217\'92}t economically accountable and their decisions will always be less \softline
efficient than those of the market. Murray Rothbard notes: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs24 \ul Private businesses must obtain their \softline
funds from investors}{\plain \fs24 .}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  It is this }{\plain \fs24 \ul allocation of funds }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 by investors }{\plain \fs24 \ul on the basis of time preference and foresight}{\plain \fs12 \ul\fs12  \softline
}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 that}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs24 \ul rations funds }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 and resources }{\plain \fs24 \ul to the most}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  profitable and therefore the most }{\plain \fs24 \ul serviceable uses. Private firms can get funds \softline
only from consumers and investors}{\plain \fs24 ;}{\plain \fs12 \fs12  they can get funds, in other words, only}{\plain \fs12 \ul\fs12  }{\plain \fs24 \ul from people who value and buy their \softline
services and }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 from}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs24 \ul investors who are willing to risk }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 investment of }{\plain \fs24 \ul their saved funds }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 in anticipation of profit. In short, payment and 
service are}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 {\u8230\'85}indissolubly linked on the market}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs24 \ul Government, on the other hand, can get as much money as it likes}{\plain \fs24 . }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 The free \softline
market provides a "mechanism" for allocating funds for future and present consumption, for directing resources to their most value-}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 productive uses for all the people. It thereby provides a means \softline
for businessmen to allocate resources and to price services to insure such optimum use. Government, however, has no checkrein on itself, i.e., }{\plain \fs24 \ul [There is] no requirement \softline
for meeting a profit-and-loss test of valued service to consumers, to enable it to obtain funds}{\plain \fs24 .{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \tab (17) State intervention is also harmful since policy-makers lack the skills and knowledge \softline
needed to make sound economic decisions. Rothbard notes: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs24 \ul A further reason for governmental \softline
inefficiency }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 has been touched on already: }{\plain \fs24 \ul [is] that the personnel have no incentive to be efficient. In fact, the \softline
skills they will develop will not be the economic }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 skills of production}{\plain \fs24 , }{\plain \fs24 \ul but political }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 skills}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 {\u8211\'96}}{\plain \fs24 \ul how to}{\plain \fs24  }{\plain \fs12 \fs12 fawn on political superiors, \softline
how demagogically to }{\plain \fs24 \ul attract the electorate}{\plain \fs12 \fs12 , how to wield force most effectively}{\plain \fs24 .}{\plain \fs24 \ul  These skills are very different from the \softline
productive ones, and therefore different people will rise to the top in the government from \par
}{\plain \fs24 \ul those who succeed in the market}{\plain \fs24 .{\u8221\'94} Thus, markets will always allocate land more efficiently than \softline
takings.\par
}\pard \fs12\sa99\sl480\slmult1 
{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (18) State intervention also fails since the complexity of the market makes it impossible \softline
for any agent to calculate the effects of their actions on the economy as a whole. Markets make \softline
such calculations unnecessary since they are self-ordering and require each agent to determine \softline
only their own best interests; since market transactions require the consent of all parties, they \softline
only occur when all effected parties will benefit individually and thus guarantee a net gain. Since \softline
eminent domain actions by definition lack the consent of all parties, they guarantee an economic \softline
loss the extent of which is impossible to predict. F.A. Hayek notes: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 Such an order, }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul [Markets,] although \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b \tab }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 (19) Cities and firms have incentives to use the takings power inefficiently since they{\u8217\'92}re \softline
under no obligation to produce promised economic gain. Somin in {\u8216\'91}04: }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul {\u8220\'93}The danger of eminent \softline
domain abuse was greatly exacerbated by the Poletown court{\u8217\'92}s failure to require new owners of \softline
condemned property to actually provide the economic benefits that justified condemnation in the \softline
first place. The lack of such a binding obligation creates an incentive for}{\plain \fs24 \sa99  }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 both }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul corporations}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12  looking to acquire \softline

that they have no obligation to live up to}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 .{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab But putting firms under binding obligations is just as bad. Somin continues: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 First, requiring }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul a \softline
binding commitment to the creation of specific economic benefits}{\plain \fs24 \sa99  }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 for the community }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul might severely \softline
constrain the discretion of the}{\plain \fs24 \sa99  }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 new }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul owners,}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12  thereby possibly }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul leading to inefficient business practices. For \softline
example, if GM had been required to ensure that}{\plain \fs24 \sa99  }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 at least }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul 6,000 workers were employed at the \softline
Poletown plant, it might have been forced to forego}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12  efficient }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul labor-saving technology}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 . }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 Courts may well be reluctant to \softline
intrude so severely on the new owners' business judgment. While this is a serious problem with requiring binding commitments, it also provides a strong argument against permitting economic \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b 1. AT {\u8220\'93}Eminent domain protects the environment.{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (1) Turn: Eminent domain lowers incentives for long-term investment in environmentally \softline
friendly technology, manufacturing methods and tools, since that investment is at constant risk of \softline
being wiped out by state seizure.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) Turn: States have historically been ineffective and poorly motivated in protecting the \softline
environment. Thus, the most likely outcome of letting them use eminent domain to promote \softline
private enterprise is that they will give land to the most politically powerful firms, not the most \softline
environment-friendly, increasing environmental harms.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (3) Turn: Any private enterprise harms the environment to some degree, since it has to \softline
consume energy, transport goods and personnel, use paper and so on. Thus, anything that \softline
promotes private enterprise on balance will create some level of harm to the environment.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (4) Turn: Takings increase usage of natural resources through new construction projects \softline
both for the firm taking the land and for the people who were displaced and now need new \softline
housing. Thus, it speeds resource exhaustion, harming the environment.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (5) Turn: Letting the state use eminent domain to promote private enterprise fuels a race \softline

build it is on the outskirts of cities, massively speeding urban sprawl.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) Turn: In most development projects, land is sold back to firms at less than market \softline

if a firm develops a vaccine for bird flu and the state seizes it at less than what the firm believes \softline
its economic value to be, the firm will have very little incentive to invest in developing vaccines \softline

the effect continues indefinitely.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) Turn: Even if seizing patents may be necessary to prevent bad stuff from happening, \softline
it{\u8217\'92}s still unjust since it fails to give patent-holders their due. If a firm develops a drug \softline
independently, their research didn{\u8217\'92}t harm anyone else and there{\u8217\'92}s no reason why anyone else \softline
would be due any of the benefits stemming from their research. Thus, depriving firms of part of \softline
the economic value of their patent by preventing them from selling their product at an ideal price \softline
on the open market fails to give them their due since if no one else can be due the value of their \softline
patent they are due its entire value.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (3) According to American Heritage dictionary, in the context of law the term {\u8220\'93}domain{\u8221\'94} \softline

{\u8220\'93}eminent domain{\u8221\'94} refers only to the seizure of land. That{\u8217\'92} why we don{\u8217\'92}t call taxes a use of \softline

enterprise by undermining the stability of their intellectual property rights and slowing

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b 1. AT {\u8220\'93}Impossible to prove negative existentials.{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (1) Negative existential claims can be proved as analytic truths. For instance, I can prove \softline
that {\u8220\'93}No square circles exist,{\u8221\'94} since the inherent features of circles logically precludes square-ness. We treat claims of justice this way all the time{\u8211\'96}for instance, we think that no justification \softline
for the Holocaust could possibly exist however hard we looked. Similarly, if I show that the \softline
inherent features of eminent domain logically preclude justice I{\u8217\'92}ve proven the resolution true.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) Even if it{\u8217\'92}s impossible to prove unqualified negative existentials, qualifiers that \softline
contextualize those claims make them provable. For instance, I can{\u8217\'92}t prove that {\u8220\'93}No unicorns \softline
exist,{\u8221\'94} but I can prove that {\u8220\'93}No unicorns exist on Earth.{\u8221\'94} That makes the resolution provable \softline
since it{\u8217\'92}s contextualized in three ways: (a) The phrase {\u8220\'93}to promote private enterprise{\u8221\'94} limits the \softline
topic to a specific set of takings; (b) the verb {\u8220\'93}is{\u8221\'94} is present-tense, limiting the topic to takings in \softline
the status quo; (c) the topic asks about {\u8220\'93}the use of eminent domain,{\u8221\'94} not eminent domain itself, \softline
limiting it to existing forms of eminent domain.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (3) The topic isn{\u8217\'92}t a negative existential claim at all. Since justice is defined as {\u8220\'93}giving \softline
each their due,{\u8221\'94} I just have to prove the positive existential claim that takings deprive someone of \softline
their due. Even if a justification for eminent domain exists somewhere out in space, that just \softline
makes it a necessary injustice. Further, lots of things that have no justification still aren{\u8217\'92}t unjust, \softline
so injustice is a positive thing rather than just the absence of justification.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (4) The argument is dumb since a {\u8220\'93}justification for eminent domain{\u8221\'94} would just be an \softline
argument that negates the resolution. All s/he{\u8217\'92}s saying is that there could be a true negative 
argument so you can{\u8217\'92}t affirm, but you can{\u8217\'92}t vote on arguments that aren{\u8217\'92}t brought into the round \softline
so until s/he gives you that argument you can{\u8217\'92}t negate.\par

can{\u8217\'92}t affirm. We debate topics because they{\u8217\'92}re debatable, meaning that we{\u8217\'92}re not going to arrive \softline
at absolutely certain answers either way. All his/her argument says is that we can never be certain \softline
that there isn{\u8217\'92}t a justification for takings out there, but that{\u8217\'92}s true of any resolution. I just have to \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (1) From American Heritage, {\u8220\'93}private enterprise{\u8221\'94} is defined as {\u8220\'93}privately owned \softline
business.{\u8221\'94} Eminent domain doesn{\u8217\'92}t violate this concept of private enterprise since it just \softline
interferes with ownership of land, not firms, and since it transfers the land to another private \softline
owner. You prefer this definition for three reasons: (1) Fairness: As s/he tells you, his/her \softline
conception of private enterprise makes the topic internally contradictory and impossible to \softline
affirm, destroying my ground. Fairness matters since debate{\u8217\'92}s a game and no one wants to play a \softline
game that{\u8217\'92}s rigged. (2) Learning: His/her interpretation fo the topic makes its substance \softline
undebatable, destroying incentives to do research and learn about eminent domain. Learning \softline
matters since it{\u8217\'92}s the goal of debate and the reason schools fund it. (3) Common usage: No firm \softline
in history has ever been completely unregulated, but we talk about firms as private enterprises. \softline
Thus, in common usage the term at most implies relatively little regulation, not none at all. \softline
Common usage matters since words are only given meaning by the way they{\u8217\'92}re used, so \softline
questions about the true meaning of the topic can only be resolved by looking at what{\u8217\'92}s meant by \softline
its terms.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) Limiting the free market can promote private enterprise in the long term. For instance, \softline
the state intervenes in the economy to correct market failures like monopolies, which ultimately \softline
promotes private enterprise. Thus, even if eminent domain makes private enterprises less private \softline
right now, it can still promote private enterprise by strengthening the entire system in the long \softline
term.\par

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (1) {\u8220\'93}The state{\u8221\'94} isn{\u8217\'92}t an independent entity. If I tell you to point to {\u8220\'93}the state,{\u8221\'94} all that you \softline
can possibly do is show me a bunch of people performing different tasks of government. Thus, \softline
the state is nothing more than the composite of a bunch of people doing certain jobs, and since \softline
their actions are open to moral evaluation those of the state are as well since the state is identical \softline
with its membership.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) Even if we view the state as an institutional entity separate from persons, it still faces \softline
choices on an institutional level and has the ability to pursue divergent policies. The fact that \softline
these choices aren{\u8217\'92}t made internally by a single person doesn{\u8217\'92}t negate the fact that they{\u8217\'92}re \softline
choices. Thus, when a state pursues policies that do less to give each their due than possible \softline
alternatives, those policies are unjust.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (3) Justice is most commonly defined as {\u8220\'93}giving each their due.{\u8221\'94} This definition is clearly \softline
applicable to states since state policies can give or fail to give people their due as easily as the \softline
actions of persons. Whether or not such state actions are immoral is irrelevant, since justice as \softline
defined is clearly distinct from morality. [}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \i This is the best conception of justice for the round in \softline
terms of fairness, since it makes it logically possible to affirm, and in terms of learning since \softline
there{\u8217\'92}s no incentive to do research if the neg is tautologically true. Fairness matters since \softline
debate{\u8217\'92}s a game and no one wants to play a game that{\u8217\'92}s rigged. Learning matters since it{\u8217\'92}s the \softline
goal of debate and the reason schools fund it.}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 ]\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (4) The argument conflicts with common usage of the term {\u8220\'93}just{\u8221\'94}. Even if concepts of \softline
justice don{\u8217\'92}t apply to states in the same way the apply to persons, we still describe state policies 
as just or unjust all the time, indicating that the terms are meant to be interpreted in a way that{\u8217\'92}s \softline
applicable to states.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (5) Turn: Seeing states as amoral actors purely concerned with political agendas has \softline
horrible real-world consequences. The realist notion that no moral rules can constrain the state{\u8217\'92}s \softline
pursuit of relative power has historically been used to justify both totalitarian and imperialist \softline
policies, as for instance it was in the case of the Third Reich and imperial Japan or on a smaller \softline
scale in modern US policies that sacrifice human rights to national security policy and military \softline
alliances with totalitarian regimes. Public acceptance of this amoralist discourse gives popular \softline
sanction to such policies, so our rhetoric with respect to the moral constraints on state power has \softline
real-world importance. Use your ballot as a tool to reject this discourse and discourage debaters \softline
from using rhetoric and arguments that conceptually justify oppression. Since this is the only \softline
real-world effect of signing your ballot in the round, it outweighs all other impacts.}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b \par

Liberty is an intrinsic good even though it{\u8217\'92}s not treated that way in societies with slavery. Thus, \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (1) Turn: Takings can break up the holding of powerful interests, lessening their political \softline
influence. In }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \i Midkiff}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 , the court upheld the use of eminent domain to split up the holdings of \softline
Hawaii{\u8217\'92}s biggest landowners to distribute them to tenant farmers. Declaring eminent domain \softline
categorically unjust prevents this kind of takings and entrenches inequalities in wealth and \softline
political power.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) Turn: Takings increase the long-term political power of landowners by giving them \softline
incentives for engagement in the political process and by allowing development that strengthens \softline
the economy and thus the economic power of lower- and middle-class property owners by giving \softline
them jobs and other indirect economic benefits.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (3) Even if condemnees have less power than corporations by themselves, they can still \softline
challenge firms in the takings process by organizing through non-profits like the Institute for \softline
Justice or through pro bono lawyers. Since one test case can challenge a whole category of \softline
takings, this is an effective way to compensate for the economic power of firms.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (4) The takings process isn{\u8217\'92}t biased against condemnees since landowners have \softline
significant influence on legislative decision. Elizabeth Gallagher writes: {\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 Too much judicial intervention is not warranted \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (1) Eminent domain isn{\u8217\'92}t inherently tied to the rhetoric of blight. First, the topic isn{\u8217\'92}t US-specific, so it applies to countries where totally different legal terminology applies. Second, most \softline
takings aren{\u8217\'92}t justified in terms of eliminating blight. Many recent cases, including Kelo, have \softline
involved takings in middle-class neighborhoods. Third, there{\u8217\'92}s no reason why takings ever have \softline
to be justified in terms of this rhetoric, so if the rhetoric of blight is unjust that doesn{\u8217\'92}t make the \softline
use of eminent domain unjust since the two are conceptually and practically distinct.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab This means both that the argument doesn{\u8217\'92}t prove eminent domain itself unjust and that \softline
even it did it only does so conditionally. In this case it would only affirm a qualified form of the \softline
topic and not justify you affirming the topic itself.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) Turn: The rhetoric of blight highlights the problem of poverty and denaturalizes the \softline
conditions of the poor. A rhetorical pretense that there{\u8217\'92}s nothing wrong with people living in run-down slums is more stigmatizing since it makes the condition of poor people seem like part of \softline

one area produces a ripple effect of decreased business, employment and consumer spending that \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (3) The argument{\u8217\'92}s conditional since it only talks about transfers from private persons to \softline

topic itself, so it{\u8217\'92}s not a reason to affirm.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (4) Turn: Stronger subjective interests can be served through eminent domain, like \softline
people{\u8217\'92}s subjective desire for opportunity and a decent standard of living. These interests \softline
outweigh on scale since the benefits of a taking apply to the whole community, and on duration \softline
since subjective attachments to land can be replaced by similar attachments to one{\u8217\'92}s new land \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b 1. AT Margaret Radin\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b \tab }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 (1) The need for stable expectations about one{\u8217\'92}s material environment doesn{\u8217\'92}t equate to a \softline
need for absolute property rights. Even if some property is really important to people, that \softline
doesn{\u8217\'92}t mean that other considerations like alleviating poverty can{\u8217\'92}t override their interest in that \softline
property.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) Turn: By promoting economic growth, takings give people a greater baseline of \softline
control over their environments by creating jobs that allow people in slums to acquire and hold \softline
property. Poverty is as bad as forced takings by Radin{\u8217\'92}s standards since it prevents people from \softline
owning significant properties in the first place and can often compel them to part with properties \softline
to which they have strong emotional ties. This impact outweighs the harms of takings on scale, \softline
since the whole community gets the economic benefits of development projects.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (3) At best, Radin only affirms part of the topic since she{\u8217\'92}s only talking about the \softline
property of persons. Since firms don{\u8217\'92}t form emotional attachments, she doesn{\u8217\'92}t problematize \softline
taking land from one firm and giving it to another. Further, not all people have strong emotional \softline
ties to their land so her argument doesn{\u8217\'92}t apply to them either. Thus, the argument only affirms a \softline
qualified version of the topic and doesn{\u8217\'92}t justify you affirming the topic itself.}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b \par

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b \tab }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 (1) Locke{\u8217\'92}s theory of property rights is incoherent in three ways. Robert Nozick writes: \softline
{\u8220\'93}}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 This is best approached by considering Locke's attempt to specify a principle of justice in acquisition. }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul Locke views property rights }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 in an unowned object }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul as \softline
originating through someone's mixing his labor with it. This gives rise to many questions. [First,] \softline
What are the boundaries of what labor is mixed with? If a private astronaut clears a place on \softline
Mars, has he mixed his labor with }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 (so that he comes to own) }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul the whole planet, the whole uninhabited \softline
universe, or just a particular plot}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 ? }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 Which plot does an act bring under ownership? The minimal (possibly disconnected) area such that an act decreases entropy in \softline
that area, and not elsewhere? }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul Can virgin land }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 (for the purposes of ecological investigation by high-}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 flying airplane)}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \ul\fs12  }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul come under ownership by a \softline
Lockean process? Building a fence around a territory presumably would make one the owner of \softline
only the fence }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 (and the land immediately underneath it). }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul [Second,] }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 Why does }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul mixing one's labor with something make[s] \softline
one the owner of it}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 ? Perhaps }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul because one owns one's labor, and so one comes to own a previously \softline
unowned thing that becomes permeated with [it] }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 what one owns. Ownership seeps over into the rest. }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul But why isn't mixing \softline
what I own with what I don't own a way of losing what I own rather than a way of gaining what I \softline
don't? If I own a can of tomato juice and spill it in the sea so that its molecules }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 (made radioactive, so I can check \softline
this) }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul mingle evenly throughout the sea, do I thereby come to own the sea}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 , }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 or have I foolishly dissipated my tomato juice}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \ul\fs12 ?}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12  \softline
Perhaps the idea, instead, is that laboring on something improves it and makes it more valuable; and anyone is entitled to own a thing whose value he has created. (Reinforcing this, perhaps, is the \softline
view that laboring is unpleasant. If some people made things effortlessly, as the cartoon characters in }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \i\fs12 The Yellow Submarine }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 trail flowers in their wake, would they have lesser claim to their own \softline
products whose making didn't cost them anything?) Ignore the fact that laboring on something may make it less valuable (spraying pink enamel paint on a piece of driftwood that you have found). \softline
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul [Third,] Why should one's entitlement extend to the whole object rather than just to the }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \i\ul added \softline
value }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul one's labor has produced? }{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 (Such reference to value might also serve to delimit the extent of ownership; for example, substitute "increases the value of" for \softline
"decreases entropy in" in the above entropy criterion.) No workable or coherent value-}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12 added property scheme has yet been devised, and any such scheme presumably would fall to objections \softline
(similar to those) that fell the theory of Henry George. }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul It will be implausible to view improving an object as giving full \softline
ownership to it, if the stock of unowned objects that might be improved is limited.}{\plain \fs12 \sa99 \fs12  For }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \ul [since] an 
object's coming under one person's ownership changes the situation of all others}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 .{\u8221\'94} Thus, Locke{\u8217\'92}s \softline
argument is logically incoherent and fails to prove that property{\u8217\'92}s a right.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b \tab }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 (2) Locke{\u8217\'92}s theory of property rights is historical; in other words, he only defends claim \softline
to property that has been acquired in a particular way. Since very little has been acquired purely \softline
through Lockean principles of just acquisition and transfer, his argument doesn{\u8217\'92}t justify treating \softline
most claims to property as absolute.}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b \par

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b \tab }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 (1) Turn: Absolute property rights destroy checks on economic power since they prevent \softline
the redistribution of rights. This entrenches existing inequalities in social and economic power by \softline
destroying any political check on them.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) Turn: Eminent domain can increase checks by breaking up large concentrations of \softline
land and dispersing wealth and power more broadly. In }{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \i Midkiff}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 , for instance, the redistribution of \softline
Hawaiian land was the only way to check the political power of Hawaii{\u8217\'92}s biggest land owners.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (3) The interests of big property owners tend to be aligned with those of the state and \softline
politically powerful groups, since both have an interest in maintaining the status quo. Thus, \softline
there{\u8217\'92}s no reason why property owners would ever check state power.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (4) Economic power can never check political power since the state has a monopoly on \softline
force, meaning that it can always redistribute wealth if it wants to. Since property rights exist \softline
only on the state{\u8217\'92}s sufferance, it{\u8217\'92}s absurd to see them as a check on the state.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (5) There are lots of other checks on state power, like voting, judicial review, \softline
international human rights law and so on. There{\u8217\'92}s no reason why property rights are a necessary \softline
check. Further, all liberal, democratic states take property through taxes and private-to-public \softline
takings all the time, meaning both that the necessity of property rights is empirically denied and \softline
that at best the impact is non-unique since other stuff violates property rights.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (6) The claim that property rights check political power is empirically denied. Fascist \softline
states have historically respected private ownership and controlled the economy through \softline
regulation instead, but that respect for property rights didn{\u8217\'92}t limit political power in those states.\par

intent of promoting private enterprise, but it was not {\u8220\'93}to promote private enterprise.{\u8221\'94}\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (3) The argument just highlights an implementation problem of eminent domain. \softline
Assessing the probable impact of a taking is difficult, but there{\u8217\'92}s no reason why it can{\u8217\'92}t be done \softline
adequately. Since I{\u8217\'92}m just burdened to defend the takings power itself, not a particular mode of \softline

have grounds for expecting economic returns that exceed that price. Although these projections \softline

justify the necessary investment in the land, to offset their operating costs, or to give the city an \softline
adequate return on its investment. Since the likelihood of actually getting economic benefits can \softline
be assessed in advance, counting development as a public use doesn{\u8217\'92}t still excludes lots of \softline
potential takings.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (2) The argument is empirically denied. The court has accepted development as a public \softline
use for decades, but it{\u8217\'92}s still struck down takings during that time when the state couldn{\u8217\'92}t \softline
demonstrate a compelling public interest in the taking.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (3) The public use clause still limits takings in another way since, as interpreted by the \softline
courts today, it still requires that the economic benefits of the development project be accessible \softline
to everyone. For instance, eminent domain can be used to build retail venues that are open to the \softline
public at large, but not to build a private country club that the public as a whole can{\u8217\'92}t use.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (4) There{\u8217\'92}s no reason why diluting the public use clause is necessarily bad. If the use of \softline
eminent domain to promote private enterprise violates the public use clause but is just in other \softline
respects, then that means we should amend the constitution to remove the public use clause \softline

groups will have incentives to seek this monopoly in order to maximize their security vis-a-vis \softline
other groups. Thus, the state is inevitable since it is a necessary development from a system \softline

exist in other countries that wouldn{\u8217\'92}t make the topic US-specific.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (4) Limiting the topic to the US harms learning since the range of research we can do is \softline

}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \tab (5) Limiting the topic to the US violates framers{\u8217\'92} intent. If the wording committee had \softline
wanted us to just talk about the US, there{\u8217\'92}s no reason why they wouldn{\u8217\'92}t have put a clause in the \softline

present uses of eminent domain. Thus, debate shouldn{\u8217\'92}t be limited to the status quo.\par

research important historical aspects of the topic and to research broader philosophical arguments \softline

goal of debate and the reason schools fund it.}{\plain \fs24 \sa99 \b \par
