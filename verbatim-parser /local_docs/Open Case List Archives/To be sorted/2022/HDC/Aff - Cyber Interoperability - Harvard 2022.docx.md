### 1AC---Plan + Russia Advantage

#### The United States federal government should substantially increase its security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the area of cyber, by defining proportional response and increasing interoperability. 

#### Russian cyberattacks are [inevitable post-Ukraine]{.underline}, and [current policy]{.underline} of [strategic ambiguity]{.underline} fails at [deterrence]{.underline}. This undermines NATO's [credibility]{.underline} and [unity]{.underline}, which [imperils the alliance]{.underline}. Refining [cyber policy]{.underline} is key.

on the Line with its Cyber Defense Pledge. That's a Bad Idea.\" March
27, 2022, from POLITICO,

President Joe Biden has **[issued grave warnings that [Russia might
launch a cyberattack against the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[in retaliation [for]{.mark} the punishing
[sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}** levied **[[after]{.mark} Moscow's
invasion of [Ukraine.]{.mark}]{.underline}** He's advised American
companies to "accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors," and many
**[[officials expect]{.mark} an [attack against critical U.S.
infrastructure to be inevitable.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

One way **[Biden and]{.underline}** other **[Western leaders are
attempting to deter]{.underline}** potential **[Russian cyber
retaliation]{.underline}** during the Ukraine **[crisis]{.underline}**
is **[through NATO]{.underline}**'s Article 5 collective defense pledge
--- that an attack on one is an attack against all. That's because since
**[the 2014 NATO summit in Wales]{.underline}** (which, coincidentally,
took place following another Russia-Ukraine crisis), **[the alliance has
affirmed that Article 5 extends to cyberspace.]{.underline}** In other
words, **[a cyberattack against any NATO member could conceivably
represent an attack against the entire alliance. The pledge is
the]{.underline}** embodiment of the allies' security guarantee to each
other and the **[beating heart of NATO.]{.underline}**

After Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Jens **[Stoltenberg
confirmed that NATO policy on collective defense and cyberspace holds
strong]{.underline}**, noting that **[NATO has "decided to make clear
that a cyberattack can trigger Article 5."]{.underline}** And following
an extraordinary meeting of heads of state and government on March 24,
the alliance reinforced that it is "ready to impose costs on those who
harm us in cyberspace."

But **[despite]{.underline}** this **[rhetoric, exactly [how]{.mark} and
when [Article 5 applies to cyber]{.mark}space [remains
unclear.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This **[[ambiguity is a
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- **[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}**
potentially **[[disastrous consequences. Staking]{.mark} the
[credibility]{.mark} of Article 5 to]{.underline}** what are often
**[murky activities in cyberspace [threatens to undermine]{.mark} the
[broader]{.mark} principle of [collective defense. We can't risk
fracturing]{.mark} the transatlantic [alliance at a critical
juncture]{.mark} in its history over a debate on what constitutes a
major or minor cyberattack.]{.underline}** For that reason, **[[NATO
should move quickly to clarify]{.mark} its [policy on
cyber]{.mark}attacks]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[explicitly
state]{.underline}** **[the threshold for what would trigger an Article
5 response.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[NATO members should commit to
treating cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of a major attack as
a national matter --- not one for the alliance.]{.underline}**

Such a shift might face some initial resistance, particularly in light
of the Kremlin's history of malicious cyber activities. One of the first
state-initiated cyberattacks was perpetrated by Russia against Estonia,
a NATO member, in 2007. In the intervening years, Moscow has increased
its malicious cyber activities, such as the SolarWinds breach uncovered
in December 2020 in which Russia gained access to a treasure trove of
U.S. data. Russian President Vladimir Putin's maneuvers against NATO
members, along with the annexation of Crimea in 2014, spurred the
alliance to adopt a Cyber Defense Pledge in 2016 that recognized
cyberspace as a military domain. Two years later, NATO created a
Cyberspace Operations Center in Mons, Belgium to improve situational
awareness and coordinate cyber operations. Since then, the alliance has
consistently reaffirmed the application of Article 5 to cyberspace. At
the 2021 summit in Brussels, NATO committed to a new Comprehensive Cyber
Defense Policy, with allies agreeing to employ the "full range of
capabilities" at all times to "deter, defend against, and counter the
full spectrum of cyber threats."

Notably, NATO refined its language with last summer's summit communique
to account for the fact that some cyber incidents may not be
individually decisive, but nevertheless significant when viewed in the
aggregate. Specifically, the allies recognized "the impact of
significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain
circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack." In
practice, however, NATO leaders have avoided clarifying the conditions
under which a cyberattack would trigger Article 5 and how NATO would
respond. When pressed about Russian cyberattacks in the Ukraine context,
Stoltenberg cautioned that, "we have never gone into the position where
we give a potential adversary the privilege of defining exactly when we
trigger Article 5."

This equivocation is not surprising, for several reasons. The **[nature
of cyberspace often confounds unequivocal deterrence declarations.
States tend to operate in cyberspace with plausible
deniability]{.underline}**, which can make it difficult to rapidly
ascertain responsibility for cyber incidents. Also, **[it can be
challenging to understand the intent behind observed cyber behavior, and
there is often a substantial time lag]{.underline}** between when an
initial penetration of a network occurs and when the target even
realizes the breach. And the vast majority of cyber operations cause
virtual, not physical, damage, complicating efforts to assess and
evaluate the implications of the costs inflicted. Moreover, **[it can
take time to develop and identify a way to infiltrate a network as well
as the computer code]{.underline}** that takes advantage of a
vulnerability for malicious ends. This means **[states may lack a
palatable cyber response option for retaliatory purposes]{.underline}**
at the desired time.

**[This creates a slew of practical problems [if Article 5 were]{.mark}
to be [invoked]{.mark} for a cyberattack]{.underline}**. From an
implementation perspective, **[it would trigger
deliberations]{.underline}** within the North Atlantic Council, NATO's
primary decision-making body. **[Decisions made within the NAC require
unanimity,]{.underline}** which can be difficult to achieve for many
issues but is especially **[burdensome]{.underline}** **[for
cyber]{.underline}** ones, **[given]{.underline}** all of the
**[ambiguities]{.underline}** outlined above. **[The]{.underline}** most
likely outcome of **[[this process would be]{.mark} a long,
[drawn-out]{.mark} deliberation [resulting in a divided alliance]{.mark}
unable to agree on how or whether to respond.]{.underline}** Quite
simply, **[some allies are unlikely to want to risk World War III for a
cyberattack]{.underline}** that disrupts the financial infrastructure,
for instance, of another country but doesn't lead to loss of life or
sustained damage.

These **[[challenges have major strategic implications for NATO.
After]{.mark} years of publicly and repeatedly linking Article 5 to
cyberspace and reinforcing that policy in response to the
[Ukraine]{.mark} conflict, a [failure to achieve consensus and respond
to a Russian cyberattack]{.mark} against a NATO member [could imperil
Article 5]{.mark} in other areas.]{.underline}** The
**[[disunity]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that is likely to be
revealed]{.underline}** during NAC deliberations
**[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** then
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[broader political
cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}** has, for
the most part, been remarkably strong throughout the war in Ukraine.
**[This [would make]{.mark} it more [difficult]{.mark} for the alliance
[to respond to other]{.mark} forms of [Russian
behavior.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As Biden emphasized at a press
conference last month, "**[the single-most important thing is for us to
stay unified]{.underline}** ... We have to stay fully, totally,
thoroughly unified."

**[NATO has achieved some strategic ambiguity with its current cyber
policy]{.underline}**, which may help to deter high-stakes Russian
assaults during the present crisis. **[However]{.underline}**, rather
than an all-out Russian cyberattack, **[a far more plausible scenario is
a lower-level attack]{.underline}** carried out **[by]{.underline}** the
**[Russia]{.underline}**n government **[or a proxy group against one or
more allies.]{.underline}** In this case, **[the alliance's interests
--- not to mention [transatlantic security]{.mark} ---]{.underline}**
**[[would be better served]{.mark} by [adopting nationally-tailored
responses]{.mark}]{.underline}** rather than pulling the Article 5
lever. Additionally, **[[to prevent]{.mark} further]{.underline}**
[**[escalation]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[reinforce
the implicit firebreak that currently exists between cyber and
conventional military operations, NATO allies should]{.underline}** also
**[[agree to restrict]{.mark} any [retaliatory response]{.mark} against
Moscow [to the cyber realm or non-military]{.mark} instruments of
[power.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

With little chance of improved NATO-Russian relations any time soon,
**[[time is of the essence]{.mark} to get this right]{.underline}**. The
**[[allies should begin]{.mark} the]{.underline}** hard **[[political
legwork now to ensure members get on the same
page]{.underline}]{.mark}** before NATO's June summit, if not sooner.
Achieving consensus on significant cyber issues has previously taken
time. NATO's attribution of the Microsoft Exchange hack last summer to
China was an important step for the alliance and sent a strong signal to
our adversaries. But it took months to reach agreement on the statement;
the hack was uncovered in March 2021 and the NATO statement was not made
public until July. In the current crisis, the alliance will not have the
luxury of waiting four (or more) months to agree on a response. **[[To
avoid]{.mark} incurring [damaging costs to NATO's credibility
and]{.mark} its [deterrent powers]{.mark}, the [allies should
refine]{.mark} their [cyber policy]{.mark}, now.]{.underline}**

#### NATO needs to present a [multilateral front]{.underline} to deter Russia---otherwise, they'll [devastate the grid]{.underline}

Dina **Aldanova 5/30**---Master's Candidate at Georgetown University's
Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies Program. (\"Will Russia
Launch a New Cyber Attack on America?\" May 30, 2022, from National
Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/techland-when-great-power-competition-meets-digital-world/will-russia-launch-new-cyber-attack)

Nevertheless, **[cybersecurity experts speculate on a range of
consequences in a worst-case cyber scenario]{.underline}**: **[[Russia
might]{.underline}]{.mark}** attempt to **[attack U.S. critical
infrastructure, [turn off the lights, target]{.mark} the operation of
[ATMs]{.mark} and credit card systems, attack Amazon's cloud,
[disrupt]{.mark} the transportation and supply of clean [water, and
target pharma]{.mark}ceuticals companies' manufacturing facilities,
power [grids, and]{.mark} colonial [pipelines.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
But will such a threat manifest?

Not only would a cyberattack against the United States contradict the
historically peripheral nature of Russian cyber warfare, but Russia's
cyber capacity would be insufficient for the task. For the past several
years, the West has largely overestimated Russian military capabilities
in conventional warfare. U.S. intelligence agencies predicted the 2022
war in Ukraine would be the most destructive the European continent has
seen since the end of World War II, expecting the fall of Kyiv to come
within days. However, the still ongoing, drawn-out war has revealed
weaknesses in the Russian armed forces, its military arsenal, and
strategic leadership. Russian officials, for their part, underestimated
the strength of the Ukrainian resistance and the united position of the
international community. Spending slightly more than 4 percent of the
country's GDP on the military, the Russian president mobilizes domestic
support for the military budget by articulating the external threat of
NATO. In a relatively undigitized society like Russia, lobbying to spend
more on the cyber budget would prove less effective. Taking this into
account, it seems possible the West could be overestimating Russian
cyber competence as well.

Furthermore, Russia is unlikely to wage a cyberattack on the United
States due to fear of retaliation on multiple fronts. Russian society is
already experiencing the consequences that the war has wrought: an
economic crisis and the psychological pressure of being cast as a global
pariah. In case of a Russian cyberattack, the consequences of U.S. cyber
retaliation would hit the public first. Given current conditions,
depriving people of water and electricity could trigger public
discontent on an unprecedented scale. Decades of increasingly
authoritarian leadership have undoubtedly engendered public grievances
hidden deep within society. At some point, this simmering disgruntlement
can boil over into outrage. Putin can ill afford to front further
domestic unrest now.

Current U.S. cyber capabilities could also contribute to the fear of
retaliation. For the past few years, the United States has developed an
impressive cyberinfrastructure, restructured its system of governance,
and invested in cyber training and education. As Richard Clarke and
Robert Knake emphasize in their book, The Fifth Domain, following the
Cold War strategy of deterrence and containment, the United States has
largely restrained itself from involvement in cyber counter activities.
Although for a long time America has focused on defensive cyber policy,
today, the U.S. Cyber Command prioritizes offensive measures. As such,
in 2019, the United States successfully targeted the Iranian
intelligence service and missile launch system as a response to an
Iranian strike against an American drone and U.S. oil tankers. Earlier
in 2012, the Stuxnet computer worm, designed in cooperation with Israel,
successfully infiltrated nuclear facilities in Iran.

In addition to an offensive preference, a more consolidated system of
governance and a set of regulations have advanced U.S. cybersecurity. A
clear allocation of roles and responsibilities between the Department of
Homeland Security and U.S. Cyber Command and the relevant leadership
improved the system of reporting incidents and information sharing. It
facilitated communication within federal agencies and between the
government, the private sector, and the public. U.S. private enterprises
now spend billions of dollars on cybersecurity, employee training, and
encrypted channels. The United States also takes a leading role in
collaborating with strategic allies on sharing best practices, detecting
flaws in networks, and promoting cyber hygiene.

International cooperation to this degree is not an asset that Russia
benefits from. **[[With]{.underline}]{.mark}** the support of **[[NATO
Cooperative Cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}** Defense Center of Excellence's
**[[r]{.mark}esearch [and]{.mark} [d]{.mark}evelopment projects,
[expertise, and training]{.mark}, U.S. [retaliation to
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** potential **[[Russian cyber attack could
be]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only detrimental but even **[[more
profound as a multilateral response]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Based on all
this, the fear of retaliation could indeed prevent Putin from engaging
in offensive cyber operations against the United States.

Finally, Putin has lost the upper hand in launching an attack by
surprise. For instance, Russia invaded Georgia during the Olympics Games
in Beijing in 2008, and Ukraine during the Sochi Winter Olympics in
2014. When Putin waged war on Ukraine in 2022---incidentally,
immediately following the Beijing Winter Olympic Games---the West
anticipated it. Putin invaded Ukraine anyway. He is unlikely to act
recklessly in this way again, considering the failures the Russian
military has experienced since the invasion. Furthermore, knowing that
the United States and European allies have shielded up, Putin has no
incentive to strike. Nevertheless, would Putin wait for a more favorable
moment? Or scale back a potential attack, for instance, by meddling in
the U.S. midterm elections in November?

**[It would be misleading]{.underline}**, however, **[to underestimate
Russian cyber capabilities]{.underline}** **[or Putin's mind games and
lose vigilance.]{.underline}** In 2020, despite denying its involvement,
**[Russia]{.underline}** evidently **[hacked U.S. software company
SolarWinds.]{.underline}** By installing malware into the company's
updated Orion software program, **[the attack affected thousands of
customers, a hundred companies such as Microsoft and Intel, and some
federal agencies like the Treasury Department, the Pentagon, and the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.]{.underline}** Cyber
experts acclaimed the code used as phenomenal. More astonishingly, if
not for a performance assessment and proper investigation, the attack
could have easily gone unnoticed. **[For over six months, Moscow tracked
emails and other traffic of sensitive information]{.underline}**. Could
there already be a similar malware in U.S. networks?

Now, **[[on the brink of a new Cold War, the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[must keep its guard up on cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Although there are significant factors that challenge the probability of
an imminent Russian cyber-retaliation, the United States should not
disregard the potential for malicious activity in the near future. **[It
needs to keep a sober view and not act hastily.]{.underline}** Setting
priorities for the long run, the United States needs to continue
advancing cyber mechanisms that detect sensitive activity like the Solar
Winds hack, and invest more in training and education about cyber
hygiene for government agencies, private companies, and the public. It
should not neglect to regularly test offline backups, run software
updates, report incidents, use multifactor authentication, block
unusable domain IP addresses, and assess third-party risks.

Although **[[Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark}** intentions are far from
clear, **[his [decision to]{.mark} pursue a [cyberattack]{.mark} on the
United States' critical infrastructure that [would instantly shut down
electricity or disrupt clean water supply]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the
**[[offense might come unexpectedly, and soon.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Cornered with sanctions and burdened by the bitterness of defeat, Putin
might act furiously. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** Western **[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[need to be vigilant]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[and maintain strong
lines of communication]{.underline}]{.mark}** about any malicious
activity. **[[With a strong multilateral front in the West, Russia will
have fewer incentives to engage in cyber warfare.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### But absent cooperation, allies will disagree and lack an effective, uniform response 

**Jackson 16**---Received his juris doctor degree from George Mason
University School of Law and is currently a Research Associate at the
Center for Infrastructure and Protection at the George Mason University
School of Business (Stephen, 8/16/2016, "NATO Article 5 and Cyber
Warfare: NATO's Ambiguous and Outdated Procedure for Determining When
Cyber Aggression Qualifies as an Armed Attack", George Mason Center for
Infrastructure Protection & Homeland Security,
<https://cip.gmu.edu/2016/08/16/nato-article-5-cyber-warfare-natos-ambiguous-outdated-procedure-determining-cyber-aggression-qualifies-armed-attack/>)

Article 5 is useful for assessing state and non-state actions used in
traditional warfare. However, the **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** allies
drafted Article 5 in light of the technology and tactics of the World
War II era. While NATO continued to successfully adapt Article 5 to the
evolving challenges post-Soviet Union, it **[[cannot]{.mark} properly
[invoke]{.mark}]{.underline}** the principle of **[[c]{.mark}ollective
[s]{.mark}elf-[d]{.mark}efense]{.underline}** **[against cyber attacks
[without]{.mark}]{.underline}** at least **[[new
definitions]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[for the various forms of cyber
events]{.underline}**. In particular, **[[without unambiguous
guidelines]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[for identifying from where a cyber
attack originated, [NATO will face]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[difficulty]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in both [locating]{.mark} the
origin of a cyber attack]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}**
**[determining]{.underline}**]{.mark} whether the cyber
**[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** was sanctioned by the host nation.
Also, **[[without]{.mark} proper [definitions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[for the various forms of cyber attacks, [NATO will]{.mark} likely
[encounter unnecessary debate between]{.mark} NATO
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[over any cyber attack against a NATO
country]{.underline}**. **[Furthermore, [without removing
ambiguity]{.mark} in identifying cyber events that equate to a
traditional armed attack, [the]{.mark} North Atlantic [Council will face
difficulty]{.mark} in [deciding]{.mark} [upon a]{.mark} proper and
[proportionate]{.mark} armed [response]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in
accord with the principles of jus in bello]{.underline}**.

Currently, **[almost [every]{.mark} NATO [ally has an individual]{.mark}
national]{.underline}** security and defense
**[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** related to cybersecurity.\[12\]
**[[These]{.underline}]{.mark}** strategies **[vary in detail and scope,
and [lack uniformity]{.mark}]{.underline}** in defining the elements of
which cyber attacks warrant an aggressive response. Some scholars argue
that the International Court of Justice accurately determined that
collective self-defense is triggered when an act "inflicts substantial
destruction upon important elements of the target state," even if the
attackers used non-traditional weaponry like airplanes or cyber
attacks.\[13\] For instance, this "scale and effects" test does not
adequately address the technical differences between using cyberspace to
create either a kinetic disruption to a power plant or the potential to
dismantle an entire financial infrastructure with zero physical effects.
The potential for a single cyber attack to result in major disturbance,
with or without any physical element, is sufficient to warrant specific
guidelines. However, as long as the North Atlantic Council assesses
individual cyber attacks on a case-by-case basis **[without
predetermined specialized rules, the [various interests of all
28]{.mark} NATO [nations will pose obstacles for]{.mark} a [swift and
efficient NATO response.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Russia will gradually escalate and use cyber as a pretext for military force. This fractures NATO, feeds misperceptions, and sparks nuclear war 

**Fisher 15**---Foreign policy editor at Vox (Max, 6/29/2015, "How World
War III became possible", Vox,
<https://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war#hybridwar>)

This poll is even worse than it looks. It assumes that Russia would
launch an overt military invasion of the Baltics. **[What would actually
happen is something far murkier, and far more likely to leverage
European hesitation: the playbook from Ukraine, where Russia deployed
its newly developed]{.underline}** concepts of postmodern **[[\"hybrid
war,\" designed to blur the distinction between war and not-war]{.mark},
to [make it]{.mark} as [difficult]{.mark} as possible [to
differentiate]{.mark}]{.underline}** grassroots unrest or vigilante
**[[cyberattacks from Russian]{.mark} military
[aggression.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Putin may already be laying the groundwork.]{.underline}**

In March of 2014, shortly after Russia had annexed Crimea, Putin gave a
speech there pledging to protect Russians even outside of Russia, which
many took as a gesture to the substantial Russian minorities in the
Baltics.

Then, in October, Putin warned that \"open manifestations of
neo-Nazism\" had \"become commonplace in Latvia and other Baltic
states\" --- repeating the language that he and Russian state media had
earlier used to frighten Russian speakers in Ukraine into taking up
arms.

This April, several Russian outlets issued spurious reports that Latvia
was planning to forcibly relocate ethnic Russians into Nazi-style
ghettos --- an echo of similar scaremongering Russian propaganda
broadcast in the runup in Ukraine.

Martin Hurt, a former senior official of the country\'s defense
ministry, warned that his country\'s ethnic Russian minority could be
\"receptive to Kremlin disinformation.\"
**[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he said, **[[could generate unrest
\"as a pretext to use military force against the Baltic
s]{.mark}tates.\"]{.underline}**

In early 2007, Estonia\'s parliament voted to relocate a Soviet-era
military statue, the Bronze Soldier, that had become a cultural symbol
and annual rallying point for the country\'s ethnic Russians. In
response, Russian politicians and state media accused the Estonian
government of fascism and Nazi-style discrimination against ethnic
Russians; they issued false reports claiming ethnic Russians were being
tortured and murdered. Protests broke out and escalated into riots and
mass looting. One person was killed in the violence, and the next day
hackers took many of the country\'s major institutions offline.

**[[Russia could]{.underline}]{.mark}** do it again, only this time
**[[gradually escalat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing **[further toward a
Ukraine-style conflict. [NATO is]{.mark} just [not built to deal with
such a crisis.]{.mark} Its mutual defense pledge]{.underline}**, after
all, **[rests on the assumption that war is a black-and-white
concept]{.underline}**, that a country is either at war or not at war.
**[[Its charter]{.mark} is from a time when war was very different than
it is today, [with]{.mark} its many [shades of
gray.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Russia can exploit this flaw]{.mark} by [introducing low-level
violence]{.mark} that more [hawkish]{.mark} NATO [members would
consider]{.mark} grounds for [war]{.mark}]{.underline}** but that
war-averse Western European states might not see that way.
**[Disagreement among NATO\'s member states would be guaranteed as they
hesitated over where to declare a moment when Russia had crossed the
line into war.]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, **[Russian state media]{.underline}**, which has shown real
influence in Western Europe, **[would unleash a flurry of propaganda to
confuse the issue]{.underline}**, make it harder to pin blame on Moscow
for the violence, and gin up skepticism of any American calls for war.

**[Germany]{.underline}**, which is widely considered the deciding vote
on whether Europe would go to war, **[would be particularly resistant to
going to war.]{.underline}** The legacy of World War II and the ideology
of pacifism and compromise make even the idea of declaring war on Russia
unthinkable. **[German leaders would come under intense political
pressure to]{.underline}**, if not reject the call to arms, then **[at
least delay and negotiate --- a de facto rejection of NATO\'s collective
self-defense.]{.underline}**

In such a scenario, it is disturbingly easy to imagine how
**[[NATO\'s]{.mark} European [member]{.mark} state[s could split]{.mark}
over [whether Russia]{.mark} had even [crossed their red line]{.mark}
for war, much less whether to respond. [Under a fog of
confusion]{.mark}]{.underline}** and doubt, **[[Russia could]{.mark}
gradually [escalate until]{.mark} a Ukraine-style [conflict in the
Baltics was foregone]{.mark}]{.underline}**, until it had marched far
across NATO\'s red line, **[exposing that red line as
meaningless.]{.underline}**

But the greatest danger of all is if Putin\'s plan were to stumble:
**[[By overreaching]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by underestimating Western
resolve to defend the Baltics, or by starting something that escalates
beyond his control**[, [it could]{.mark} all too easily [lead to
full-blown war.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

\"That kind of **[[misperception]{.mark} situation [is]{.mark}
definitely [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and **[that's how wars
start]{.underline}**,\" Saideman said, going on to compare Europe today
with 1914, just before World War I. \"The thing that makes war most
thinkable is when other people don't think it's thinkable.\"

In 1963, a few months after the Cuban missile crisis had almost brought
the US and Soviet Union to blows, President John F. Kennedy gave a

Feel Threatened?

language edited change denoted by brackets

According to recent reporting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) announced that its Cyber Operations Center (COC) is expected to
be fully staffed and functional by 2023. The new COC marks NATO's
understanding of the importance that cyberspace plays in conflict,
particularly in times of political tensions that has resulted in cyber
malfeasance that has targeted elections and critical infrastructure. The
establishment of the COC is a natural evolution in how to address cyber
attacks in a more timely manner by integrating cyber actions with more
conventional military capabilities. **[In]{.underline}** early
**[2014]{.underline}**, after notable cyber incidents were a part of
international incidents that occurred in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in
2008, **[the [Alliance updated]{.mark} its [cyber]{.mark} defense
[policy to classify]{.mark} digital [attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** as
the equivalent of kinetic attacks **[[under]{.underline}]{.mark}** its
collective security arrangement under **[[Article
5]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the treaty. In those particular instances,
Russia was suspected in orchestrating or at least tacitly supporting the
cyber attacks that afflicted both states. **[[Since
then]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark}** alleged
cyber **[[activities have only become more brazen
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** their **[[scale and
aggressiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From suspected involvement in
launching cyber attacks against Ukrainian critical infrastructure to
launching a variety of cyber operations to meddle in the elections of
foreign governments, **[[Russia has taken advantage of]{.mark} the
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}** of cyberspace **[[where there is
little consensus on]{.underline}]{.mark}** key issues such as Internet
governance, **[[cyber norms]{.underline}]{.mark}** of state behavior,
**[[or]{.mark} the [criteria by which cyber attacks escalate]{.mark} to
a point of war]{.underline}**.

NATO has always provided a strong military counterpoint to Russian
influence in the European region and projecting a credible threat in
cyberspace is an important complement to NATO capabilities. However,
previously, NATO didn't have any of its own cyber weapons, a significant
problem given Russia's perceived position of a near-peer level adversary
of the United States. With the establishment of the cyber command, the
United States, United Kingdom, and Estonia have offered the Alliance
their cyber capabilities. As described in one news article, **[the
alliance hopes to integrate individual nations' cyber capabilities into
alliance operations, coordinated through the COC]{.underline}** and
under the command of NATO's top general. With this in hand, it will be
interesting to see if this will serve as the deterrent it's intended to
be and how Russia may adjust their cyber activities, particularly
against NATO member countries.

However, there is still the lingering problem the Alliance faces with
regards to the rules of engagement. **[[Classifying cyber attacks under
Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a start but **[[doesn't]{.mark} help
[provide a path forward to how NATO can]{.mark} and should [engage and
respond]{.mark} to cyber attacks. While this provides]{.underline}**
NATO a certain **[[flexibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** in addressing
cyber attacks allowing the Alliance to take each on a case-by-case basis
in determining the extent of its response, **[it [does not
provide]{.mark} adversarial states [an idea of tolerated and
intolerable]{.mark} cyber [activities. This]{.mark}]{.underline}**
shortcoming **[[serves]{.underline}]{.mark}** only to provide states
like **[[Russia enough wiggle-room to continue]{.underline}]{.mark}**
their **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**ffensive
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**yber
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**peration**[[s]{.mark} as long as they don't
cross an undefined threshold.]{.underline}** It's long been hypothesized
that **[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** ~~crippling~~ **[[\[destroying\]
critical infrastructures would meet that
threshold]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but as seen in Ukraine, **[[this bar
keeps being pushed]{.mark} a little [farther]{.mark} each
time.]{.underline}**

#### Russian grid attacks collapse US and European grids AND spark US nuclear retaliation 

**O'Hanlon 19**---Senior fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings
Institution, where he specializes in U.S. defense strategy, the use of
military force, and American national security policy. He is also
director of research for the Foreign Policy program at Brookings. He is

and University of Denver (Michael E., April 2019, *The Senkaku Paradox:

Scenarios, pgs 34-6, Brookings Institution Press, ProQuest Ebook)

If any initial conventional engagements went against its interests,
**[[Russia]{.mark} might]{.underline}** also **[consider limited nuclear
employment options.]{.underline}** Indeed, some of **[its
[strategists]{.mark} currently [entertain]{.mark} an ["escalate to
de-escalate"]{.mark} concept [that would]{.mark} attempt to [intimidate
NATO allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** into reversing their plans. **[Russia
might detonate a nuclear weapon high in the atmosphere to create
a]{.underline}** powerful nuclear-induced electromagnetic pulse **[(EMP)
that could prove lethal to air defense radars, military communications
systems, and much civilian infrastructure over a region]{.underline}**
many hundreds of kilometers in radius. A Russian EMP burst using a
high-altitude nuclear weapon would be an extremely provocative and risky
move, to be sure. 57 But some Russian leaders could argue that it was
not strictly speaking a nuclear attack, since no humans would be killed
by the direct explosive effects of such a weapon---and thus might delude
themselves into thinking it was a relatively low-risk
option**[.]{.underline}** In fact, the risks could be very high. Some
types of **[EMP attacks (or even [cyberattacks) by Russia
could]{.mark}]{.underline}** ~~disable~~ **[[\[shut down\] large chunks
of]{.mark} the [U.S. or European electricity grids for]{.mark} many
[months.]{.mark}]{.underline}**58 A severe **[attack of [this]{.mark}
type [might]{.mark}]{.underline}** even **[[lead to a U.S. nuclear
response, in light of]{.mark} the [new nuclear doctrine]{.mark}
of]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration. 59 Beyond
the EMP option, Russia could use nuclear weapons directly against ships
that carried military equipment, missile defense radars, or other
capabilities. Indeed, it threatened to target nuclear missiles at any
Danish ships joining the U.S.-led missile defense effort in 2015. Again,
the provocation would be enormous--- but the direct human stakes might
be fairly limited, since only dozens of sailors, or at most a couple
hundred, might be on a given naval vessel. 60 **[Moscow
might]{.underline}**, perhaps delusionally, **[think the risks were
acceptable.]{.underline}** Of course, there would be enormous
significance and risk to crossing the nuclear threshold in any way. But
if weapons were used against isolated military targets (as both sides
contemplated in various ways during the Cold War),
**[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}** again [**[might convince
itself]{.underline}**,]{.mark} rightly or wrongly, **[that [escalation
risks could be]{.mark} tolerated and [managed.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
That might be particularly true for attacks limited to the kinds of
target sets that posed disproportionate vulnerability and dependence for
NATO. These could include cargo ships at sea, rail marshaling yards
where train tracks change gauge (necessitating unloading and reloading)
at the Poland- Lithuania border, or particularly weak bridges without
nearby alternative routes. 61 If Russia could limit NATO fatalities to
hundreds of sailors and not itself present any target sets that were
characterized by a similar combination of relatively high military
importance and relatively great separation from vulnerable civilian
populations, NATO might not have a good recourse. **[Moscow might hope
as much, at least---[and]{.mark} so elect to [roll the
dice.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Such a decision would be reckless and
foolish, but perhaps not beyond the pale of how human beings have
behaved historically in wars they felt they were otherwise likely to
lose.

#### Grid collapse causes extinction

Consequences of a sustained power outage The EMP Commission states
"**[Should significant parts of the electrical power infrastructure be
lost for any substantial period of time]{.underline}**, the Commission
believes that the **[consequences are likely to be
catastrophic]{.underline}**, and many **[people will die for the lack of
the basic elements necessary to sustain life]{.underline}** in dense
urban and suburban communities." \[67\]. Space constraints preclude
discussion on how the **[[loss of the grid would render]{.mark}
synthesis and [distribution of oil and gas inoperative.
Telecom]{.mark}munications [would collapse, as]{.mark} would [finance
and banking]{.mark}. Virtually [all tech]{.mark}nology[, infrastructure,
and services]{.mark} require electricity[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** An EMP
**[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** that collapses the electric power grid
**[[will collapse]{.mark} the [water
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}**---the delivery and purification of
water and the removal and treatment of wastewater and sewage. Outbreaks
that would result from the failure of these systems include cholera. It
is problematic if fuel will be available to boil water. **[Lack of water
will cause [death in]{.mark} 3 to 4 [days]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[68\].
**[[Food production would]{.mark} also [collapse. Crops]{.mark} and
livestock [require water]{.mark} delivered by electronically powered
pumps.]{.underline}** Tractors, harvesters, and other farm equipment run
on petroleum products supplied by an infrastructure (pumps, pipelines)
that require electricity. The **[plants that make fertilizer,
insecticides, and feed also require electricity.]{.underline}** Gas
pumps that fuel the trucks that distribute food require electricity.
**[Food processing requires electricity.]{.underline}** In 1900, nearly
40% of the population lived on farms. That percentage is now less than
2% \[69\]. **[It is [through tech]{.mark}nology that [2% of the
population]{.mark} can [feed]{.mark} the other
[98%]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[68\]. The acreage under cultivation today
is only 6% more than in 1900, yet productivity has increased 50 fold
\[69\]. As stated by Dr. Lowell L Wood in Congressional testimony: "If
we were no longer able to fuel our agricultural machine in the country,
the **[food production]{.underline}** of the country **[would simply
stop]{.underline}**, because we do not have the horses and mules that
used to tow agricultural gear around in the 1880s and 1890s". "So the
situation would be exceedingly adverse if both electricity and the fuel
that electricity moves around the country......... stayed away for a
substantial period of time, we would miss the harvest, and **[[we would
starve]{.mark} the following winter]{.underline}**" \[70\]. People can
live for 1--2 months without food, but after 5 days, they have
difficulty thinking and at 2 weeks they are incapacitated \[68\]. There
is typically a 30-day perishable food supply at regional warehouses but
most would be destroyed with the loss of refrigeration \[69\]. The EMP
Commission has suggested food be stockpiled for a possible EMP event. A
prescription for failure **[Even if all the
recommendations]{.underline}** of the Congressional EMP Commission
**[were implemented, there is no guarantee that the grid will not
sustain a prolonged collapse.]{.underline}** There should therefore be
contingency plans for such a failure. There is also another
consideration. The foundational pillars of prior American nuclear
defense policy, in today's climate, are of uncertain validity**[. Mutual
assured destruction is the Maginot line of the 21st
century.]{.underline}** Nonproliferation will prove difficult to
resurrect. The **[consequences of a widespread nuclear attack have been
positioned to the public as massive deaths from blast
effects]{.underline}**, and then further lingering deaths from the
effects of radiation. We suspect there will be no electricity, and
**[[there will be no electricity for a very long time. There should be
a]{.mark}n actionable [plan]{.mark}]{.underline}** in anticipation of a
possible prolonged collapse of the grid---a retro-structure and a skill
**[set [to provide a framework for survival.]{.mark} Our sense is [there
is no plan.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### US-Russia war causes extinction

Dr. Owen **Cotton-Barratt 17**, PhD in Pure Mathematics, Oxford,
Lecturer in Mathematics at Oxford and Research Associate at the Future
of Humanity Institute, et al, "Existential Risk: Diplomacy and
Governance," 2/3/2017,
https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, **[even [in a]{.mark}n
all-out [nuclear war between]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
despite horrific casualties, **[neither country's population is likely
to be completely destroyed by the direct effects of the
blast]{.underline}**, fire, and radiation.8 **[The [aftermath
could]{.mark} be much worse]{.underline}**: the
**[burning]{.underline}** of **[flammable materials could [send
massive]{.mark} amounts of [smoke into the
atmosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which would absorb sunlight and cause
sustained global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural disruption
-- **[[a nuclear winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

According to one model 9 , **[an all-out exchange of 4,000
weapons]{.underline}**10 **[[could]{.mark} lead to a [drop]{.mark} in
[global temperatures]{.mark} of around 8°C, [making it impossible to
grow food]{.mark} for]{.underline}** 4 to **[5 years.]{.underline}**
This could leave some survivors in parts of Australia and New Zealand,
**[but they would be in a very precarious situation and the [threat of
extinction]{.mark} from other sources [would be great]{.mark}. An
exchange on this scale is [only possible between the US and Russia who
have more than 90% of the world's nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads
each, although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models
suggest that even **[[a small]{.mark} regional nuclear [war]{.mark}
involving 100 nuclear weapons would]{.underline}** produce a nuclear
winter serious enough to **[put two billion]{.underline}** people **[at
risk]{.underline}** of starvation,12 **[though this]{.underline}**
estimate **[might be pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 **[Wars on this scale
[are unlikely to lead to]{.mark}]{.underline}** outright **[human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but this does suggest that conflicts
which are around an order of magnitude larger may be likely to threaten
civilisation. It should be emphasised that there is very large
uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global climate.
This remains an area where increased academic research work, including
more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of how
survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns.

It is very difficult to precisely estimate **[[the]{.mark} probability
of existential [risk]{.mark} from nuclear war]{.underline}** over the
next century, and existing attempts leave very large confidence
intervals. According to many experts, **[t]{.underline}**he most likely
nuclear war at present is between India and Pakistan.14 However, given
the relatively modest size of their arsenals, the **[risk of human
extinction [is]{.mark} plausibly [greater from]{.mark} a conflict
between the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Tensions between these countries have
increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the
possibility of them rising further in the future.

#### Ambiguity entangles the US and allies with offensive action---increasing cyber cooperation and defining proportional response solves

**Arts 18**---Program coordinator supporting The German Marshall Fund of
the United States' (GMF) security and defense policy work in Washington
DC, strengthens transatlantic cooperation on regional, national, and
global challenges and opportunities in the spirit of the Marshall Plan
(Sophie, December 2018, "Offense as the New Defense: New Life for NATO's
Cyber Policy," GMF Policy Brief, No. 039,
<https://nato-engages.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offense-as-the-New-Defense-New-Life-for-NATO%E2%80%99s-Cyber-Policy.pdf>)

Perhaps most importantly, **[as NATO stands ready to integrate defensive
and offensive cyber operations, it should further clarify how these
relate to its collective defense provision. Although [NATO holds]{.mark}
that [Article 5 could be invoked]{.mark} following a "significant"
cyberattack against one or more of the allies]{.underline}**,46
**[[officials]{.mark} have [remained]{.mark} deliberately
[ambiguous]{.mark} when it comes to [defining]{.mark} the parameters of
[a qualifying attack]{.mark}]{.underline}** so as to discourage hostile
operations that would fall just below such a specific threshold.47
**[[Without a clear line, allies have more room to maneuver]{.mark} in a
cyber crisis short of invoking Article 5.]{.underline}** However, recent
experience across the **[[alliance has yielded little proof that]{.mark}
the [strategic ambiguity]{.mark} in this domain [is
effective]{.mark}]{.underline}** in preventing hostile operations.

**[As [NATO]{.mark} seeks to address this challenge]{.underline}**, it
[**[will need]{.underline}**]{.mark} to assess how to develop an
**[[effective cyber policy that balances deterrence with]{.mark} the
potential risk for [escalation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** With this in
mind, **[[it should establish]{.mark} more precise [thresholds for
cyber-attacks and define proportional response]{.mark}
scenarios.]{.underline}**48 Without these, it will likely remain very
challenging to mobilize allies to invoke Article 5 in a cyber crisis.
**[[This could be]{.mark} particularly [difficult if]{.mark} a
[crisis]{.mark} were to be [triggered]{.mark}]{.underline}** or
exacerbated **[[by o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber [o]{.mark}peration[s
under]{.mark} the command of [a NATO ally or if such operation]{.mark}
on the part of NATO [were]{.mark} used as a [pretext for crisis.
Considering]{.mark} the potential [escalatory nature of]{.mark} a more
[forward-leaning posture -- within NATO and driven
by]{.mark}]{.underline}** its largest member, **[[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates -- these [questions should be urgently
addressed.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

NATOs cyber-resilience experienced in crisis management and
communication

**[Societal [security]{.mark}]{.underline}**, an emerging phenomenon in
the field of strategy and security, **[[requires
good]{.underline}]{.mark}** crisis management skills but also
**[[communication]{.underline}]{.mark}** effectiveness in both the real
and virtual worlds. **[Business continuity at NATO
requires]{.underline}** as foresaid the Alliance, to be resilient and
surely for the purposes of this research paper, the Alliance and
**[allies to be]{.underline}** or become
**[cyber-resilient.]{.underline}**

By methodological approach, societal vulnerability continues and will
always continue to exist, so far and as long as threats are there.
Considering the current civil need to be always preparing for a new
"cold era," among others, considering the unlawful annexation by Russia
of Crimea in 2014 (BBC, 2014) and following the disintegrating relations
of NATO due to the unlawful act of Russia to Ukraine, the establishment
of the USA and then taken over by NATO, of the Missile installation in
Romania (Reuters, 2016) and the immediate reaction and accusation of
Russia in regard to these developments (New York Times, 2016), the
refugee challenges as an outcome on the constant fight against ISIS (US
Homeland Security Committee, 2015), but also the phenomenal changes in
the financial world (i.e., The Panama Papers (The International
Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICJ), 2016)), **[NATO is
required to become truly resilient NATO, as should also nations and
leaders.]{.underline}**

All aforementioned elements are crisis management factors. NATO provides
the tools and methodologies, in which the Alliance is requested to reply
strategically and operationally. To mitigating plans for pre-crisis,
during crisis and after crises situations. For and during operations,
logistics of deployment or information gathering and or training
purposes, among others.

In such similar cases, **[the [legal and political perspectives]{.mark}
also [on cyber]{.mark} operations [should be clear]{.mark}. The
[success]{.mark} of an operation [lays to effective logistical and
operational support]{.mark}. Therefore, [the legal aspects that come
with sharing]{.mark} of [info]{.mark}rmation, on [how to deploy forces,
identify key threats]{.mark} and elements in cyber-space, [are
important]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The Internet has no borders. And
threats can easily infiltrate the national e-space and boundaries.
Leaders are welcomed upon to take strong strategic-led decisions.

**[NATO is to ensure protection of all infrastructure. The Allies should
be able to anticipate, identify, mitigate, and recover from "hybrid
attacks]{.underline}** (NATO Review, 2016)"---the dimension(s) of
simultaneous attacks, while reducing the threat of destabilization and
or spreading fear.

In a civic society, it is our responsibility to ensure adequate
awareness on cyber-defense and security. **[[To learn about the
necessity]{.mark} [to protect]{.mark} all [infrastructures]{.mark},
[NATO's collective defense should be characterized by]{.mark} [burden
sharing]{.mark}, [openness]{.mark}, flexibility, [and transparency in
coop]{.mark}eration and [info]{.mark}rmation [flow among member]{.mark}
state[s]{.mark}. [Through preparedness]{.mark}, strategic and
operational awareness, [strategic resilience can be achieved]{.mark}.
Response time and framework will then allow NATO to counter threats as
they emerge.]{.underline}**

THE WHAT

[**[Internally]{.underline}**, **[NATO members need to be clear about
specific actions]{.underline}** **[they can reasonably expect the
alliance to deter]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** Clearly, an
armed attack---from whatever direction---is one course of action to be
deterred, but other actions are not so simple.1

**[In the case of Russia]{.underline}** (and other state actors), **[the
focus is also on deterring coercion]{.underline}**: the act of
adversaries imposing their will on NATO allies **[through a combination
of military threats and nonmilitary means.]{.underline}** **[For now,
the thinking at NATO has emphasized deterrence of a territorial grab or
blockade in the Baltic region. However, the characteristics of the
Russian approach to warfare]{.underline}** **[mean that the alliance has
to look beyond the Baltic Sea]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[beyond the physical domain,]{.underline}** **[mainly to the cyber
realm]{.underline}**.2 More and more of the critical systems running
hospitals, carrying electricity, or patrolling the skies are now
connected to the internet and therefore vulnerable. NATO's adversaries
can, in theory, block allied governments from coming to each other's aid
by threatening devastating cyber attacks that will cause populations to
panic and cripple economies.

**[[NATO]{.mark} has already declared that a cyber attack could lead the
alliance to invoke]{.underline}** its **[Article 5]{.underline}**
collective defense clause, **[a [statement]{.mark} that [aims
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[have a [deter]{.mark}rent
effect]{.underline}**---**[[though there is little ev]{.mark}idence that
[it]{.mark} has [stopped adversaries from trying]{.mark}.3 This is
mainly [because]{.mark} most [cyber attacks are designed to stay below
the level that would trigger a response]{.mark} of the whole alliance.
The [allies need a clearer policy on what to do if the line is
crossed]{.mark}]{.underline}** one day. That policy must also address
the thorny issue of credible attribution and should be rehearsed
rigorously.

THE HOW

NATO does not need to mirror the activities of its adversaries to deter
effectively. The idea is to signal that the alliance will not be
intimidated or coerced, but that can be done in multiple ways.

With regard to Russia and the threat of a land incursion, NATO has
decided to rely on limited forward deployments along its Eastern flank
and on the ability to reinforce quickly those small contingents in times
of crisis. The shortcoming of this posture is that if Russia overwhelms
the first line of defense, it may be able to use the strength of its
conventional forces, as well as the threat of nuclear weapon use, to
thwart allied reinforcement.

NATO, as a whole, is adapting its posture to respond, and the United
States is strengthening its military presence in Europe to address these
potential weak points. The mix of U.S. troops and stored equipment and
supplies in Europe is being expanded, including in Poland. And NATO has
taken steps to improve its ability to deploy units from North America
and move them around Europe by creating a Joint Force Command for the
Atlantic and a Joint Support and Enabling Command. Other means of
strengthening deterrence include implicit or explicit threats of
political or economic sanctions or threats of countermeasures in
cyberspace.

Regarding the South, the exact form of deterrence has to match the
threat that NATO chooses to deter. With regard to potential state
adversaries, NATO's existing deterrence tools and military capabilities
can be utilized against threats from that direction. The creation of the
Strategic Direction South Hub---a consultation and coordination body for
allies and partners---at the NATO command in Naples, Italy, also
contributes to the deterrence mission. However, these measures alone
will not deter the main challenge in the South: terrorist groups, with
the potential to strike in Europe, operate in lawless spaces.

RECOMMENDATIONS

NATO may be back to its traditional mission of deterrence, but
deterrence itself has evolved. **[A new approach must be adapted to
today's environment]{.underline}**, in which a number of deterrence
challenges need to be tackled simultaneously and sophisticated
nonconventional means can be used jointly with traditional military
tools to test the alliance.

**[MAINTAIN ALLIANCE COHESION]{.underline}**

While the allies' initial response to deterrence challenges has been
impressive, in the long run, **[deterrence fatigue]{.underline}** **[may
present problems]{.underline}**. **[NATO needs to keep all allies
committed]{.underline}** to the deterrence mission and continue to
secure sufficient contributions of committed forces, capabilities, and
resources. **[The [risk]{.mark} is that [allies' unity and
cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[the]{.underline}** indispensable
**[foundations]{.underline}** **[of
NATO]{.underline}**---[**[will]{.underline}**
**[weaken]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[as]{.underline}]{.mark}** memories
of the Islamic State's caliphate and of Russia's aggression against
Ukraine fade. **[[Adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}** will do their part
to **[sow]{.underline}** **[or]{.underline}**
**[[exploit]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[divisions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[or]{.underline}** **[doubts]{.underline}** about the strength of
solidarity among alliance members.

**[To keep cohesion from fraying, [NATO's
leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[should]{.underline}**]{.mark}
continuously **[[engage]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**[every ally in
dialogue]{.underline}** **[about]{.underline}**]{.mark} the rationale
for the **[[posture]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the **[threat
assessment]{.underline}**, and members' views on, and concerns over, the
implementation of the deterrence mission. National governments have the
same essential responsibility toward their parliaments and publics. NATO
must also make sure that discussions do not focus only on one strategic
direction but rather address both defense and crisis-management tasks.

Engagement with partners should include a dedicated dialogue on
deterrence issues. In some cases, based on mutual consent, NATO should
be ready to explore coordinated deterrence signaling or mutually
reinforced deterrence activities, such as joint statements, deployments,
or exercises.

Engagement with adversaries must be seen as an inseparable companion to
deterrence. Dialogue and multiple contact channels remain crucial to
convey and receive deterrence signals, avoid accidental or inadvertent
escalation, and explore risk-reduction and arms control opportunities.

DETER RUSSIA'S ADVENTURISM

In the foreseeable future, specific **[challenges connected with
deterring Russia will continue to dominate the practical
agenda]{.underline}**. As a priority, the allies should fully implement
the 2018 decisions to adapt NATO's command and force structure.4 The
military credibility of the current deterrence posture depends, to a
large extent, on the alliance's ability to speedily augment its
forward-deployed units with follow-on forces.

Th**[e [allies]{.mark} [should]{.mark} look for new ways of stimulating
the [develop]{.mark}ment of [necessary
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}**
**[interoperability]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [**[A more transparent
discussion]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the major
[gaps]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in allied capabilities [could]{.mark}
help [exert pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[on]{.mark} [members to
make relevant investments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The NATO Military
Committee should play a more active role in the alliance's adaptation by
more visibly highlighting the military requirements for credible
deterrence to civilian authorities and---via individual military
leaders---to NATO populations.

The alliance should continue Article 5--related exercises, especially in
more vulnerable regions, as the exercises play a role in deterrence
signaling. But NATO must also increase the realism of such exercises to
identify the areas where the alliance is lagging behind. The alliance
needs more exercises that test mobility, logistics, and the preparedness
of infrastructure to transport troops.

NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence and Tailored Forward Presence
strengthen deterrence, but the units deployed need to become a more
coherent military force. This calls for further calibrating their combat
potential, particularly by adding enablers such as air and missile
defense, logistical support, and intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance. Flank countries should step up their regional
cooperation to help advance that goal.

The process of adapting deterrence is ongoing, and developments on the
Eastern flank will require the alliance to constantly reassess its
posture. For example, Russia's deployment of the dual-use SSC-8 cruise
missile system and other long-range missiles requires a response.5 On
the deterrence track, NATO will need to react to the threat of Russia
striking targets away from the border such as harbors, airfields, or
command centers, which are crucial for NATO's ability to deploy its
reinforcements. This response should include a mix of bolstering
defensive measures and strengthening NATO's ability to strike back. On
the dialogue track, NATO can signal its openness to potential arms
control talks.

An additional area that requires attention is the nuclear dimension of
NATO deterrence. A more integrated approach to conventional and nuclear
planning and exercises is needed. For example, conventional and nuclear
exercises should be based on the same scenarios, although not
necessarily conducted in the same region or at the same time. NATO needs
to walk a fine line by sending deterrence signals to Russia but without
suggesting a lowered threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. Fully
integrating cyber, space, and information operations into a
comprehensive deterrence posture is a less controversial but equally
pertinent task.

**[DETER UNCONVENTIONAL AND HYBRID THREATS]{.underline}**

NATO needs to be careful about defining and signaling its redlines.
Making these boundaries too specific could embolden adversaries to
intensify their actions below NATO's declared threshold of response.
Being deliberately ambiguous and raising the fear of retribution may be
more useful for encouraging adversaries' self-restraint.

**[At the same time, NATO should aim to deter specific types
of]{.underline}** **[particularly threatening]{.underline}**
**[unconventional activities]{.underline}**. These
**[include]{.underline}** **[major]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[sophisticated]{.underline}** **[cyber attacks]{.underline}**
**[against allies' military forces and critical military
and]{.underline}** **[civilian infrastructure]{.underline}**, **[proxy
military and special forces operations, and state-sponsored
terrorism]{.underline}**. **[NATO could declare that such activities may
lead it to invoke Article 5]{.underline}** **[and respond in various
ways]{.underline}**, including asymmetrically (for example, the response
to a cyber attack may not involve only cyber capabilities).

**[The [alliance must]{.mark} be able to
[identify]{.mark}]{.underline}** early **[[whether]{.mark} [and
when]{.mark} unconventional and [hybrid]{.mark} gray-zone [actions have
become]{.mark} a [more substantial]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[coordinated]{.underline}**
**[campaign]{.underline}**. **[In such a case, [NATO should]{.mark} aim
to [deter]{.mark} [the adversary]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[from
escalating further]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[This requires]{.mark}
[increasing]{.mark} the alliance's [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[to]{.underline}** **[share]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[early-warning
[intel]{.mark}ligence and pool national intelligence-gathering,
investigation, and attribution capabilities]{.underline}**. NATO should
not shy away from attributing ongoing operations to state adversaries,
relying on national data as needed. The alliance and its members should
be prepared to use direct channels of communication and other means to
deliver immediate deterrence signaling in specific cases.

On the Southern flank, NATO faces state actors that use unconventional
tactics and proxy forces (for example, Iran and Syria); state collapse
and the emergence of ungoverned spaces in Libya, Yemen, and parts of the
Sahel; and the activities of a range of nonstate actors, from loose
groups to terrorist and criminal networks to highly organized
quasi-state structures like Hezbollah. Cooperation with regional
partners in addressing these threats will be vital. NATO's primary task,
as elsewhere, should be to deter states in the region from using
unconventional tactics against NATO and its allies, using signaling and
attribution tools. When possible, the alliance should aim to affect the
calculus of nonstate actors to prevent them from harming alliance
interests. This may not work with jihadist groups but may be possible
with actors motivated by political or economic interests.

Since many of the unconventional threats are not linked to specific
regions or actors, a more general approach is called for. The alliance
and its members need to continue investing in passive and active
measures to neutralize unconventional threats, including in peacetime.
Further developing cyber defense and offensive capabilities---NATO's
toolbox for countering hybrid tactics---and strengthening resilience can
affect adversaries' willingness to use unconventional means against NATO
and thus help establish deterrence by denial. The
toolbox---counterterrorism, special forces, information operations,
disruption of terrorist groups' cyberspace activities---that allies
develop for dealing with nonstate and quasi-state entities posing
unconventional threats can also be used to deter state adversaries that
rely on such tactics.

**[ENCOURAGE FURTHER DEBATE]{.underline}**

**[For deterrence to work, the [allies must clearly communicate]{.mark}
their [resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[readiness]{.underline}** **[to respond to an aggressive
action]{.underline}**. **[Clear communication]{.underline}** **[is also
needed [to reassure]{.mark} the [allies]{.mark}
concerned]{.underline}**. At the same time, the alliance faces a
challenge in explaining to many citizens of NATO countries the necessity
of deterrence. This is especially difficult in the area of nuclear
deterrence, where reliance on such destructive weapons remains
politically dubious and morally repulsive for many.

THINK AND SPEAK COHERENTLY

**[[This would]{.mark} greatly [help]{.mark} individual

**[[these]{.mark} strategies]{.underline}**, including that of the

completed---such as Slovenia's 2018 regulation on cyber and information
security or Croatia's 2017 National Security Strategy, which partly
deals with hybrid challenges---have largely opted for different
approaches.

**[[NATO]{.mark} member states [must send a unified message]{.mark}

mind-set]{.underline}**, **[it has to be built]{.underline}** together
**[carefully]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[fundamentally]{.underline}**.12 NATO's communication strategy should
be a result of joint efforts and hence a common instrument against all
threats, not just hybrid ones, at all levels.

**[the attribution of, and [responses to, cyber

ISSUES AT STAKE

Armed forces and vital civilian organizations, such as operators of
energy networks, rely more and more on computer systems for their
operations. This increases both their efficacy and their vulnerability.
NATO saw the significance of this trend some time ago, and **[since
2016, the allies have recognized cyberspace as a domain in
itself]{.underline}**. **[The alliance integrates cyber capabilities
into its thinking and planning for operations]{.underline}**, even if
mainly in defensive terms. The alliance's 2016 Cyber Defense Pledge
helped member states strengthen their national cyber defense
capabilities by working together.2

**[Twenty-four of NATO's twenty-nine member states have issued public
cyber doctrines]{.underline}** **[that deal with military
issues]{.underline}**.3 Dedicated units are being created across NATO
countries, either with a unified cyber command, as in France and the
United States, or with a devoted cyber force, like in Germany. **[This
is the right step overall, although allies' [differing
approaches]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to cyber strategy and organization
[could cause challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[when it comes to joint
and]{.underline}** **[combined]{.underline}**
**[operations]{.underline}**.

NATO is responsible for protecting its networks and infrastructure, as
well as promoting cooperation among allies and with partner nations. For
the moment, the alliance's most important prerogatives and capabilities
lie in the defensive use of cyber capabilities, although individual
countries can volunteer various cyber services---not only defensive
ones---to NATO commanders. In 2018, the alliance set up the Cyberspace
Operations Center in its command structure to help nations and
commanders better understand these possible national contributions and
their uses. NATO also strengthened its cooperation on cyber matters with
the EU through a joint declaration at the alliance's 2016 summit in
Warsaw.4

There is often little difference in offensive cyber capabilities between
criminal groups and some military forces. Hacking tools are becoming
more accessible. In 2017, the U.S. National Security Agency's
sophisticated offensive suite was stolen or leaked and subsequently used
in attacks.5 In parallel, critical civilian infrastructure, such as the
networks that govern energy or water distribution, is becoming more
dependent on the internet, making it a target in potential conflicts.
This infrastructure could even be used as a tool for a large attack: if
corrupted by hackers, it could be turned into a botnet---a network of
computers linked by malware. It has become possible, in theory, to
achieve a strategic effect with cyber attacks on civilian facilities and
infrastructure, which tend to be less protected than military equipment.
As a result, the line between the defense of military and nonmilitary
assets in cyberspace is becoming increasingly blurred.

One consequence of this trend is closer military cooperation with
civilian authorities, including law enforcement. However, military
organizations and armed forces tend to invest more than civilian
ministries or agencies in cyber defense and cybersecurity. In the United
States, for example, the Department of Defense accounted for more than
50 percent of the 2018 federal cybersecurity budget, representing \$8.5
billion out of \$15 billion.6 Unchecked, this trend creates a growing
gap between military and civilian spending.

Several international organizations and, more recently, companies have
decided to address stability in cyberspace and the regulation of cyber
conflicts. Some states and nonstate actors are even suggesting the
adoption of a treaty on the use of information technology and
international security. After meetings of the United Nations (UN) Group
of Governmental Experts failed in 2017 to reach a consensus on what
constitutes states' responsible behavior in cyberspace, the UN initiated
two new negotiation processes. One is a resolution, sponsored by the
United States and European countries, to create a new group of
governmental experts.7 The other is a Russia- and China-sponsored
resolution to set up an open-ended working group.8 The two tracks have
different calendars and mandates, including on consultative meetings.
The outcomes of their work, and the potential codes of conduct for cyber
conflict they could generate, will provide guidance for how all
countries, including NATO allies, should behave in the future regarding
cyber operations

RECOMMENDATIONS

Research and development policies and investment strategies in cyber and
military technologies are key elements to ensure that armed forces are
equipped with up-to-date capabilities. The fast pace of technological
evolution requires NATO member states to make significant, continuous
investments to avoid falling behind in terms of capabilities.

Alongside investments in technology, **[allies need to strengthen
education in cyber matters, not only in engineering, but also in
strategic thinking and social use]{.underline}**. All military personnel
have to be involved to ensure greater cybersecurity awareness and a
better integration of cyber capabilities into military operations.
**[The [most important]{.mark} challenge for NATO as an alliance [is to
bridge]{.mark} the [gap]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[between]{.mark} those
[states with first-rate]{.mark} cyber
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and]{.mark} awareness and
[those that lag behind]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Currently, **[a
[handful]{.mark} of member states [are pulling away]{.mark} from the
others [in]{.mark} terms of the mass [integration of]{.mark} connected
devices, [quantum]{.mark} computing, [and]{.mark} [a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence--based systems. This gap could have
a]{.underline}** **[major impact]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}**
**[burden sharing]{.underline}** **[in NATO,]{.underline}** because a
low level of spending by one or more countries would need to be
compensated by the others to maintain a satisfactory global level for
the alliance.

**[Allies should draw up national cyber rules of engagement for
offensive operations in accordance with principles of international
law]{.underline}**. Certain policies espoused by some member states,
such as hack-back, which allows private firms to pursue attackers into
other companies' networks, or cyber deterrence, could lead to
uncontrolled escalation.9 International law tends to limit this
escalation to mainly economic responses, such as sanctions and
countermeasures. **[All NATO [allies]{.mark} also [need to
ensure]{.mark} that their [rules]{.mark} of engagement [are compatible
with]{.mark} the [alliance's]{.mark}]{.underline}** agreed **[[approach
to cyber defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[At present, different
countries have different views on]{.underline}** offensive **[cyber
policies,]{.underline}** in particular.

The alliance should give technical assistance to member states that are
willing to share information and national best practices. NATO should
expand its rapid-response system to cover attacks that blur the line
between the military and nonmilitary realms, such as an attack on
critical nonmilitary networks in the context of a NATO military mission.

**[Unity]{.underline}** **[is important when it comes to external
communications]{.underline}** **[by the allies,]{.underline}** or by
NATO's secretary general, on attribution. While the decision to
attribute an attack to a particular entity remains a sovereign and
political one, allies should discuss any such communication from
individual capitals before it is made. This would not only prevent
uncontrolled escalation but also preserve the strength and unity of the
alliance.

**[NATO should develop [standards on]{.mark} the [security of
emerging]{.mark} cyber [tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}** in close
partnership with the EU. **[Allies [could address]{.mark} the
[interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[security]{.underline}** **[of connected devices]{.underline}** in the
defense sector **[[by devising a]{.mark} common [policy]{.mark} in the
alliance]{.underline}**. NATO **[should]{.underline}** also **[impose a
minimum standard of cybersecurity in products]{.underline}**, such as
connected devices and systems; computer-based technologies; and command,
control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems during the acquisition process.

**[Quantum computers deserve particular attention from NATO, because
they can be game changers in the military domain. The [alliance]{.mark}
should act [as a gateway between member]{.mark} state[s' militaries and
defense companies to promote]{.mark} further [industrial
cooperation]{.mark}, notably]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}**
**[technical standards]{.underline}**. Such cooperation should be based
on the NATO Industry Cyber Partnership, which provides platforms for the
exchange of information, threat trends, and best practices. **[The
alliance must foster the maximum possible level of
cooperation]{.underline}** **[[to ensure]{.mark} that [NATO]{.mark}
countries [are]{.mark} the [first to implement this]{.mark}
technology.]{.underline}**

escalation risk between nuclear-armed states, Journal of Strategic
Studies, Routledge

The remainder of the article proceeds as follows. First, it
contextualizes the concept of 'catalytic nuclear war' with emerging
security technologies, particularly AI. The article uses this analytical
framework to examine how and under what circumstances the **[nefarious
[(mis)use of these technologies by non-state
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}** (i.e., terrorists, criminals, and
state-proxy actors) **[might [create]{.mark} or exacerbate [escalation
pathways]{.mark} leads [to an accidental nuclear confrontation between
nuclear-armed powers.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Next, in the articles'
empirical core, it considers four aggravating features **[in the
[interaction of emerging tech]{.mark}nology [with nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the **[[pathways to]{.mark} nuclear
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}** examined in the article --
**[[information complexity and asymmetry; greater automation of NC3;
disinfo]{.mark}rmation, misinformation]{.underline}**, and
**[[information manipulation; and nuclear
multipolarity.]{.underline}]{.mark}**15 This article posits that
**[[AI]{.mark}-enhanced [capabilities will]{.mark} likely [amplify these
underlying conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or second-order effects),
**[thus [increasing]{.mark} the risk of sparking [unintentional
escalation]{.mark} between strategic nuclear-armed powers -- especially
in crisis and conflict conditions.]{.underline}** The next section uses
four fictional scenarios -- cyber false flag operation, cyber-attack on
nuclear early-warning systems, drone swarming targeting ISR systems, and
deepfake disinformation -- to demonstrate how **[AI-enhanced
[capabilities]{.mark} in the hands of non-state actors [might]{.mark}
accidentally or inadvertently [drag a competitive nuclear dyad into
conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The final section considers possible
ways of reducing catalytic escalation risk caused by non-state actors,
particularly how militaries can maintain effective command and control
of their nuclear forces in a rapidly evolving and complex conflict
environment.

### Aff---Case---Extend: Strategic Ambiguity Fails

#### Russian cyber adventurism is inevitable. Strategic ambiguity within NATO strains the alliance and wrecks deterrence 

**Patrick 18**---James H. Binger senior fellow in global governance and
director of the International Institutions and Global Governance (IIGG)
Program at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) (Stewart Patrick,
8/8/2018, "NATO\'s Deterrence Problem: An Analog Strategy for a Digital
Age", Council on Foreign Relations,
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/natos-deterrence-problem-analog-strategy-digital-age>)

While the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was founded on the
idea of collective defense, the nature of security threats has changed
since its inception. The Cold War-era alliance is struggling to adapt to
evolving technology and the altered nature of warfare. Nowhere is this
more true than in the cyber realm. **[NATO policymakers]{.underline}**
have **[acknowledged cyberwarfare as a distinct sphere of conflict, but
they have not yet tailored nuclear-era concepts of deterrence and
response to this new domain.]{.underline}** As cyberattacks increase in
destructive potential and remain difficult to attribute, the **[alliance
face the dilemma of whether and how to adapt their policy of strategic
ambiguity to a new era of cyberwarfare.]{.underline}**

**[At their annual summit]{.underline}** last month, the twenty-nine
**[[allies reaffirmed]{.mark} the integral [role cyber]{.mark}security
[plays in NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**, creating a Cyberspace Operations
Center to supplement existing cyber defense facilities and reaffirming
the need for an offensive capability "to deter, defend against, and to
counter the full spectrum of cyber threats." **[[Missing]{.mark} from
the communique]{.underline}**, however, **[[were any rules of
engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the cyber sphere. This raises the
question: **[[How would NATO respond if a]{.mark} member [state were to
invoke Article V]{.mark} of the North Atlantic Treaty following a
cyberattack?]{.underline}**

The **[NATO]{.underline}** alliance has long **[maintained a policy of
strategic ambiguity when it comes to nuclear]{.underline}** policy,
leaving open the possibility that a conventional attack might be met
with a nuclear response. (By contrast, China and India have adopted
"no--first use" policy for nuclear weapons.) **[[NATO]{.mark}'s nascent
cyber policy [exhibits]{.mark} a similar [ambiguity]{.mark},
intentionally [leaving unclear how the alliance would react to a
cyberattack.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Rather than responding in kind,
**[[NATO might]{.mark} instead [conduct conventional
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as missile strikes, **[[allowing
for rapid escalation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Early cyberattacks were largely seen as low-stakes events: an
inconvenience for the financial sector and dangerous for personal data,
but not a threat to national security or justification for a military
response. This is no longer necessarily the case. **[[A coordinated
Russian cyberattack]{.mark} against a nuclear power plant]{.underline}**
in Europe and the United States **[[could have devastating
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**, were it to result in major
radiation leaks. An attack on a country's electric grid, a softer
target, could in theory cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage
and put lives at risk as traffic lights stop working, hospitals lose
power, and unrest erupts.

Given these stakes, **[NATO has]{.underline}** an obvious **[incentive
to strengthen its capacity to deter and punish
cyberattacks]{.underline}**, including through conventional retaliation.
A U.S. Department of Defense memorandum published in early 2017 stated
that at least for the next decade, **[offensive cyber capabilities are
likely to outpace cyber defense, making deterrence the most viable
option.]{.underline}** Both the United States and NATO also recognize
that **[[a devastating cyberattack could quickly escalate to violent
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** by triggering a conventional response.
Unfortunately, **[the [alliance's]{.mark} policy of [strategic ambiguity
falls short]{.mark}.]{.underline}** By **[[failing to define]{.mark} the
[rules of engagement for retaliation]{.mark}, the [alliance leaves
open]{.mark} the [potential for chaos in determining an appropriate
response]{.mark} to cyberattacks]{.underline}**. In doing so, **[[it
invites adversaries to test the waters.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Cyber deterrence is inherently more challenging]{.underline}** than
nuclear or conventional deterrence **[because such attacks are difficult
to definitively attribute to a particular actor.]{.underline}** For
example, it is easier to mask the source of a cyberattack on a power
grid than it would have been for the Warsaw Pact to conceal a massive
incursion into West Germany. This attribution problem could complicate
NATO's capacity to conclusively determine the source of a cyberattack
and justify and conduct a timely conventional response, particularly if
member states diverge in their perceptions. **[[This]{.mark} dilemma
[could strain]{.mark} the [foundations of collective defense]{.mark} and
[undermine any unified front against
cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

For NATO to commit to military action, all of its members would need
certainty, beyond a reasonable doubt, about the identity of the
perpetrator. This is particularly true in the case of Russia---a known
sponsor of cyberattacks. Without conclusive proof, it might be a
challenge to convince a distant country like Portugal or a dangerously
close one like Estonia to join in a counterattack. Complicating matters,
such post-attack decisions would need to be made quickly, given Russia's
precedent of using cyberwarfare as a precursor to kinetic invasion. The
need for speed leaves little room for philosophical debates over what
constitutes an act of war.

To be sure, NATO's strategic ambiguity is not without its benefits.
Uncertainty about the threshold for a military response could persuade
an adversary not to push the envelope with an audacious attack. But that
same **[[ambiguity could lead an adversary to
miscalculate]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Moreover, **[the doctrine also
leaves open the possibility of discord in the ranks of NATO member
states regarding how to deal with any such attack.]{.underline}**

**[NATO's policy of strategic ambiguity]{.underline}** served it well
during the long Cold War nuclear confrontation. But it **[may be less
appropriate to the era of cyberwarfare, particularly given the problem
of attribution and the potential for inter-allied
disagreement]{.underline}** on the appropriate response to any
particular incident. **[[NATO]{.mark} policymakers [need to]{.mark}
resolve this dilemma by [formulat]{.mark}ing [a more explicit
cyber]{.mark}warfare [doctrine]{.mark} to which all of its member states
can adhere. This should include [updating their]{.mark} mutual
[understanding of what constitutes]{.mark} an act of [aggression
under]{.mark} NATO's [collective defense]{.mark}
provisions]{.underline}**, making explicit to potential adversaries just
what its red lines are, and establishing clear procedures and channels
for robust allied response to cyberattacks. **[[Unless NATO clarifies
current ambiguities, Russian aggression in]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark}
realm [could go unchecked]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Through these organizations and agreements, **[[NATO]{.mark} has
improved and strengthened its unified cyber defense
capability,]{.underline}** **[seemingly positioning itself to be a
standard bearer for cybersecurity. However, these [commitments lack
specifics]{.mark} and could [hamper]{.mark} NATO's [ability to respond
to an attack]{.mark} because of bureaucratic and security protocols.
[Following]{.mark} the [inclusion of cyber]{.mark} attacks [under
Article 5, NATO]{.mark} and its allies [could not agree]{.mark} on
[what]{.mark} kind of [attack would trigger the]{.mark} collective
defense [response. Allies]{.mark} still [use their own]{.mark} incident
[standards]{.mark} to define cyber incidents [and]{.mark} in some cases
[do not make these]{.mark} standards [public]{.mark}. This [results in
an uneven response and makes it difficult]{.mark} for NATO and its
allies [to provide a unified, Article 5 response to cyber
incidents]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Stoltenberg has defended this vague
definition by stating that, "a clearly defined threshold only invites
attacks immediately beneath it." This clarification does not address the
larger issue of which attacks would trigger an Article 5 response, as
NATO already defends against low-level cyber attacks daily**[.

to]{.mark} potentially embarrassing]{.underline}** **[[overreactions to
minor incursions or]{.mark} devastating [slow responses
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** ~~crippling~~ **[[\[devastating\]
attacks.]{.mark} Without a clear definition, NATO will struggle to
respond]{.underline}** **[to attacks.]{.underline}**

As stated earlier, **[NATO's focus is on deterring attacks---to such an
extent that the cost of an attack would outweigh any
benefits.]{.underline}** **[However, this focus has resulted in NATO
lacking the offensive capabilities]{.underline}** **[to
respond]{.underline}** **[in the same capacity as its
allies]{.underline}**, like the United States. **[There is some
discussion within NATO over [taking an "offensive defense" role]{.mark}
within cyber in order to respond directly [after an attack.]{.mark} This
change will have its own repercussions, as it [may lead to an attack
being wrongly attributed or a response unnecessarily
escalated.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Despite]{.underline}** the **[necessity of exercises like Defender
2020]{.underline}**, new purchases of advanced military equipment and
the **[expansion]{.underline}** **[of military manpower
(]{.underline}**all underway since 2014), these steps together
**[constitute a growing paradox]{.underline}** **[that the Alliance has
been slow to recognise]{.underline}** and respond to. That is, **[just
as the Alliance is becoming more focused on and]{.underline}** more
**[capable of]{.underline}** **[responding]{.underline}** **[to an
Article 5 threshold-crossing event]{.underline}**, **[the probability of
a conventional]{.underline}** **[manoeuvre]{.underline}** **[warfare
scenario is decreasing]{.underline}**. Put another way, **[major
improvements in the Alliance's ability to defend the territory of its
member states are necessary, but it is becoming]{.underline}** ever more
**[obvious that these steps will not be sufficient]{.underline}** **[for
collective defence in NATO's next decade.]{.underline}**

Many European security analysts believe **[an [Article 5]{.mark}
threshold-crossing [event]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[is]{.underline}**
**[unlikely]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in the coming
years]{.underline}**. **[[Russia is]{.mark} a [declining]{.mark}
state]{.underline}** **[along]{.underline}** **[several measures,
especially in economic terms, and over time the acute
threat]{.underline}** **[that it represents today should
diminish]{.underline}**. Certainly, it has made advances recently in
limited military capability areas, such as indirect fires and precision
munitions. Yet, the Russian playbook evidently continues to
**[eschew]{.underline}** **[frontal attacks]{.underline}** **[on states
that are members of a military alliance, at least in the air, sea, land
and space domains.]{.underline}**

**[A frontal attack]{.underline}** in one of these domains or some other
egregious assault **[compelling NATO to invoke Article 5 would not play
to Russia's strengths]{.underline}** -- **[instead, [it would]{.mark}
actually [expose]{.mark} its many [weaknesses]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[ultimately [resulting in certain defeat]{.mark}. [Moscow's]{.mark}
military and governing [elites know this]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[For
this reason, the [Kremlin has]{.mark} consistently [chosen to
emphasise]{.mark} and]{.underline}** **[leverage]{.underline}** **[its
comparative advantages]{.underline}** **[to make effective use of its
clearly]{.underline}** **[limited resources]{.underline}**. The
**[military policy]{.underline}** tools that facilitate this do not
resemble armoured columns crossing national frontiers. Rather, they
**[include]{.underline}** **[fomenting civil unrest]{.underline}** with
the goal of creating a justification for Russian military or
paramilitary action in unaligned, neighbouring or near-neighbouring
states, **[as seen in Moldova (1992), Georgia (2008) and Ukraine
(2014).]{.underline}** They **[also include [cyber
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[such as]{.underline}** that unleashed
on **[Estonia]{.underline}** in 2007. They **[include]{.underline}**
**[influence peddling]{.underline}** **[and the cultivation of patronage
networks. And]{.underline}** they include **[semi-deniable election
interference]{.underline}**, as occurred in the US in 2016 and 2018 and
in Europe in recent years as well. **[All of these policy tools
represent asymmetric responses]{.underline}** **[to US and Western
power]{.underline}**, especially military capacity and capabilities.
**[They [enable Moscow to cost-effectively]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[pursue]{.mark} the [disintegration of]{.mark} Western
power]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[[the]{.mark} Western
[alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} as a way of achieving
Russia's strategic and material ends. Given the current state of the
Russian economy and the rather grim outlook for the years to come,
**[[Moscow]{.mark} is very likely to continue pursuing these sorts of
policies in the coming]{.underline}** **[decade, because it
[lacks]{.mark} other [options]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[The [fundamental challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[facing
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** between now and the Alliance's 80th
anniversary **[[is]{.mark} figuring out how]{.underline}**,
**[where]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[when]{.underline}**
**[it will counter and compete iteratively with
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- but also China **[-- [in the grey
zone]{.mark},]{.underline}** the space between war and peace, or between
offense and defence. **[Because grey-zone challenges do not neatly
correspond to classical notions of those which fall in the military's
domain and those which do not, they are particularly
vexing]{.underline}**. This is why adversaries such as Russia and China
employ grey-zone tactics and operations -- they allow Moscow and Beijing
to confront the West on more favourable terrain.

The good news is that **[NATO's leaders appear to understand the
character of the competition]{.underline}**, and have taken several
steps to address the challenge. The Alliance has reportedly developed a
strategy outlining NATO's role in responding to grey-zone or hybrid
threats. In some cases, grey-zone scenarios are finding their way into
NATO and member states' exercises. And critical infrastructure
protection, energy security and societal resilience have become
important topics of discussion at Alliance-sponsored events and
seminars, and among Alliance-affiliated entities such as centres of
excellence.

**[However, in several important aspects, the Alliance response
remains]{.underline}** ~~handicapped~~ \[**[weak]{.underline}**\].
**[Although NATO declared in 2016 and again in 2018 that it could
consider a hybrid attack as grounds to invoke Article 5,]{.underline}**
**[the bar seems high]{.underline}** -- **[perhaps]{.underline}**
**[impossibly so.]{.underline}** **[Achieving consensus]{.underline}**
-- **[and quickly --]{.underline}** **[in the face of an ambiguous
attack]{.underline}** **[or in response to ostensibly unrelated
low-level provocations will not be an easy task]{.underline}**. Perhaps
more importantly, **[NATO remains in a defensive crouch when it comes to
grey-zone challenges]{.underline}** -- Alliance rhetoric, exercises and
actions emphasise response and reaction. **[It is precisely for this
reason that grey-zone challenges against NATO are likely to
be]{.underline}** **[effective]{.underline}** -- actors such as
[**[Russia]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and China]{.underline}** **[are
[evidently undeterred]{.mark} by the Alliance's]{.underline}** defensive
**[posture]{.underline}**, and attacks on Western institutions continue
to this day. To be clear, defence is important, but in the current
international security environment, offense and the competitive actions
in between the two are equally important.

**[Given the]{.underline}** arguably **[inadequate]{.underline}**
**[Alliance response to date]{.underline}**, **[some
guideposts]{.underline}** **[may be helpful to illuminate the path ahead
as NATO attempts to ensure collective defence remains robust into its
eighth decade]{.underline}**. First, [**[Article 5]{.underline}**
**[is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[an [imperfect]{.mark}
tool]{.underline}** for determining when and where the West must spend
blood and treasure in defence of its interests and way of life.
**[[Despite]{.mark} [Alliance rhetoric]{.mark} regarding hybrid warfare
as a potential Article 5 trigger, the [threshold]{.mark}
for]{.underline}** **[Alliance-wide [action is too
high]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[adversaries]{.mark} like Russia]{.underline}** and China [**[know
it]{.underline}** -- **[this is why they pursue]{.underline}**
**[grey-zone tactics]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in the first
place]{.underline}**. **[To facilitate the speedy
response]{.underline}** **[that will be necessary]{.underline}** **[to
meet the needs of Allied defence against grey-zone
challenges]{.underline}**, **[greater]{.underline}**, routine **[use can
be made of Article 4 and Alliancewide consultations]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[coordination]{.underline}** **[on
issues]{.underline}** and topics **[that go beyond conventional military
operations that are NATO's bread and butte]{.underline}**r. For
instance, the Alliance can and should conduct more vigorous, regular
consultations and intensified coordination on topics such as keeping
Chinese investment out of sensitive information-technology and logistics
sectors, limiting and rolling back Russian broadcast and print media
penetration of Western markets, undermining the Kremlin's and Putin's
trustworthiness within Russia, and exposing Russian and Chinese official
corruption at home and abroad, all as mechanisms to compete and thereby
strengthen collective defence.

#### Shared understanding now is [impossible]{.underline}---that decks credibility

**Limnell 16** (Jarno Limnéll, Professor of Cybersecurity, Aalto
University, Finland Charly Salonius-Pasternak, Senior Research Fellow,

Cyber Article 5.\"

The current 'cyber warfare playbook' is still a slim volume - but it is
growing by the day. In order to remain a credible defence alliance,
**[[NATO must possess a credible]{.mark} cyber
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including cyber deterrence. Credibility
comes from a largely similar set of actions as NATO has engaged in
regarding conventional military. Doing it in the cyber domain is,
however, harder at the moment. For example, what is the equivalent of
standing up in practice permanent battalions in member states? How do
you exercise, publicly message determination to defend and counter
aggression, in a serious but non-threatening way?

[**[NATO]{.underline}** **[has to find a clear way to deal
with]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a '[Cyber]{.mark} Article 5'
event]{.underline}**. It may be necessary to reinterpret what Article 5
and an armed attack constitute in today´s world. [**[The]{.underline}**
**[biggest challenges]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to
reach [a shared understanding of]{.mark} the
[limits]{.mark}]{.underline}** (physical and cyber) **[which could lead
a member state [to]{.mark} invoke [Article 5 and]{.mark}
delineate]{.underline}** what **[[proportionality]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[in response]{.mark}]{.underline}** means. **[The [decisions
are]{.mark} [political by]{.mark} their [nature and requires]{.mark}
[strong understanding]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Commitment to proportional response restores [deterrence credibility]{.underline} and prevents [escalation spirals]{.underline} 

**Schulze 19** (Dr Matthias Schulze is Associate in the International
Security Division at SWP; "Cyber Deterrence is Overrated" SWP, August
2019; https://www.swp-berlin.org/10.18449/2019C34/)

[[Deterrence fails if]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[threat of
punishment]{.underline}]{.mark} is **[[not]{.mark}]{.underline}**
considered [[credible]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[Deterrence
[fail­ure]{.mark}]{.underline}** often [[leads to the use]{.mark} **[of
capabilities]{.mark}** and]{.underline} thus [escalation]{.underline}.
This [raises questions about the proportionality, effectiveness and
accuracy of cyber retaliation capabilities.]{.underline} How much
objective damage must be in­flicted so that A considers the costs of
further offensive action to be too high? How does D know whether A
considers threats against certain assets to be particularly painful or
not? A and D most likely have different perceptions about what assets
are considered especially sensitive. These different perceptions make
proportional reactions difficult. [[There is no]{.mark} inter­national
[consensus on]{.mark} how [proportional cyber
retaliation]{.mark}]{.underline} might be conceived[.
**[Thus]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[**[increased risk of escalation]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [The
[damage]{.mark} caused [by cyber retal]{.mark}iation **[must be
appropriate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [If the damage threat­ened by D is
too great, the probability of a renewed retaliation by A
increases.]{.underline} It is [well researched in political
science,]{.underline} **[that [escala­tion spirals]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[a consequence]{.mark} [if]{.mark} a
[retal]{.mark}iation [is]{.mark} perceived as **[inappropriate]{.mark}**
or too painful. In these cases, **deterrence fails**.]{.underline} If
the threat of punishment is considered not costly enough and thus not
credible, deterrence does not work either. Determining the correct
measure is highly complex and also a function of the attribution
prob­lem: the lower the chance of being caught, the greater the threat of
punishment by D must be

### Aff---Case---Extend: Russian Cyberattacks

#### Russian cyber operations blur the line between wartime and peace---they'll utilize cyber and AI in tandem to escalate 

**Aaltola 21**---Director of the Finnish Institute of International
Affairs, Finland, and Professor of International Relations at Tallinn
University, Estonia (Mika Aaltola, 2021, *Democratic Vulnerability and
Autocratic Meddling*, Chapter 4: Russian Cyber-Enabled Diversions in the
West, Springer)

The **[[challenge to]{.mark} the [existing]{.mark} regional
[order]{.mark} inevitably [blurs the line between normal and
unconventional.]{.mark}]{.underline}** What is considered legal,
established, and conventional becomes an obstacle as the challenger
tries to reset the rules and expectations. This logic increases the
possibility of unexpected events in the region. The **[[distinction
between peacetime and wartime]{.mark} practices [can become more
blurred.]{.mark}]{.underline}** However, there is no evidence of using
cyberattacks to cause widespread physical damage in the region;
infrastructure has been outside of the targets.

So far, the attacks have been unlikely to attract clear retaliatory
actions. **[[Risks]{.mark} have [clearly]{.mark} been [taken by
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but **[[in a calculated way that
maximizes]{.mark} the [psychological and political effects and
minimizes]{.mark} the chances of [punishment.]{.mark}]{.underline}** On
the other hand, the harm scale that focuses on physical damage misses
the real significance of politically motivated cyberattacks. For
example, the damage caused by rigging an election process far surpasses
some of the physical harm scenarios.

It is important to realize that even when uncovered, the attacks
showcase the perpetrators' capabilities. This can even be useful for the
attacker, as its image as a powerful modern actor is highlighted in
public discussions. When an operation becomes public, the perpetrators
can always point to attribution issues and deny their role in the
operations to delegitimize any retaliation. Perhaps paradoxically,
public revelations about ongoing and active cyber operations can even be
part of the overall strategic goal of demonstrating power and impunity.
This is a possibility that target states and institutions have to
consider.

Although many lessons have been learnt by now, the **[[main
response]{.mark} to cyberattacks [has been to strengthen
deterrence]{.mark} by [bolstering cybersecurity.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
The **[[systems are]{.mark} now [in a]{.mark} much [higher reactive
mode. Vigilance has been increased]{.mark} against different types of
shocks, disruptions, and attacks.]{.underline}** It is likely that the
**[[West will continue to be a target]{.mark} of low- to mediumintensity
cyber operations.]{.underline}** One may argue about whether high
resilience can be achieved without more active deterrent measures. On
the other hand, it takes two to tango online. The higher the active
deterrence, the stronger the counterreaction is likely to be. The fear
is that this may culminate in a destabilizing cyber arms race.

Ever **[higher awareness is needed to recognize that [cyber
op]{.mark}eration[s have strategic aims]{.mark} that go beyond mere
snooping and spying and, especially those, that can be [sowing the seeds
for]{.mark} or be parts of much more [serious societal
destabilization]{.mark} and democracy meddling
operations.]{.underline}** Clearly, **[cyber tools and operations can be
effective in spreading mistrust]{.underline}**, blackmail, and bullying,
**[and in displaying capabilities and deterrence.]{.underline}** They
are useful in combination with other politically pressurizing tools. The
spectrum of these combinatorial tools is still being experimented and
the tools are likely to evolve considerably. The clear concern is that
the **[[situation may escalate]{.mark}, in which case the level of harm
caused by cyber operations in combination with other influence tools
will become higher and more intense for the highly digitalized
democracies.]{.underline}** One should also note that the **[level of
[harm is always realized in hindsight.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The Dukes
and Red October/Turla were identified only a long time after the
infections. This suggests that in the present moment, there might
already be ongoing attack campaigns with a higher level of harm which
are yet to be detected. The analysis **[[cannot exclude]{.mark} the
[possibility of a further escalation in malicious cyber and AI
activities and their use in tandem with destabilizing cognitive
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** and hybrid tool. If such a scenario
materializes, then the **[intensifying cyber operations]{.underline}**
of today **[can be seen as a preparatory phase for a far more aggressive
challenge directed mainly at the key functions and stability of the
Western political systems.]{.underline}**

#### Russia will utilize cyberattacks to spark conflict across the region---the plan solves

**Stojkovski 21**---freelance journalist covering foreign policy and
technology based in Skopje, North Macedonia (Bojan, 1/4/2021,
"**[[Flawed Cybersecurity Is a Ticking Time Bomb for the
Balkans]{.underline}]{.mark}**", Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/01/04/flawed-cybersecurity-is-a-ticking-time-bomb-for-the-balkans/>)

**[On]{.underline}** the night of **[July 15, 2020]{.underline}**, the
**[Balkan nation of [North Macedonia was]{.mark} anxiously
[awaiting]{.mark} the preliminary [results of its]{.mark} parliamentary
[election.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Soon after the polls closed, in what
was first believed to be a minor technical glitch, the website of the
State Election Commission went down.

The polling results were nowhere to be found on the website in the next
several hours, as the commission resorted to manually announcing the
latest updates on a makeshift YouTube channel. And things didn't get any
better in the late hours of the night.

**[That night, the [country suffered]{.mark} the [biggest cyberattack in
its history.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The website of the electoral
commission stayed down for the next few days, recovering from a
full-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that
~~paralyzed~~ its functions, as thousands of IP addresses targeted the
site. Months later, the authorities' probe into the matter has yet to
produce any findings about who might have been behind the attack.

While authorities claimed that the
**[[cyberattack]{.underline}]{.mark}** did not have any serious
consequences on the election process and the results themselves, it
**[managed to [highlight how fragile]{.mark} the [IT systems of
government institutions]{.mark} in the country
[are.]{.mark}]{.underline}** A few weeks later, hackers also targeted
several ministries, again **[demonstrating the urgent need for better
cybersecurity measures.]{.underline}**

The **[[lack of expertise]{.mark} among the staff, [insufficient
financial resources, and]{.mark} the overall [neglect of
officials]{.mark} when it comes to the topic of cyberdefense
[are]{.mark} among the main issues [plaguing]{.mark} state [institutions
across the region.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It's not only North Macedonia;
**[many [other]{.mark} countrie[s in the region]{.mark} just [aren't
doing enough]{.mark} when it comes [to having strong
cyberdefense]{.mark} systems.]{.underline}** And in most cases,
individuals prove to be the weakest link because they have not been
trained and educated on how to defend against such attacks.

In March 2020, North Macedonia became NATO's newest member. Looking to
boost its overall defense capabilities, the **[[country is]{.mark} now
also [putting its hopes on NATO's assets and
expertise]{.mark}]{.underline}** when it comes **[[to improving its
cybersecurity.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

However, during the last few years, **[NATO member states across the
region have also been hit hard by various cyberattacks.]{.underline}**
In 2019, neighboring Bulgaria suffered the largest theft of personal
data in the region, after its National Revenue Agency was hacked. More
than 5 million Bulgarians have had their personal data exposed, and the
hacked database was shared on various hacking forums.

Authorities charged a 20-year-old Bulgarian cybersecurity expert for the
hack, although the motives behind it remained unclear. The attack
illustrated just how weak cybersecurity practices at Bulgarian
government institutions were.

**[[With]{.mark} the [country]{.mark} currently [in a political turmoil
and facing its next parliamentary elections in March 2021]{.mark}, the
[cyberattack]{.mark} on the National Revenue Agency [could]{.mark} also
[serve as a warning of what's about to come.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Apart from ransomware attacks, DDoS and malware attacks are some of the
most common tools that hackers have been using to target state
institutions. In most cases, the damage that these types of attacks can
do could be very expensive.

"DDoS are one of the most common hacker attacks ... due to the fact they
are relatively simple and inexpensive to implement, compared to other
types of attacks," said Ljubica Pendaroska, a Skopje-based privacy and
data protection expert.

"But the potential harm that they can do could be worth
millions---counted in lost earnings, compromised systems, creating
distrust in institutions, data theft, and the like."

According to Pendaroska, such threats should constantly keep state
institutions on alert and maintain an institutional awareness of the
need for highly organized and functional protection systems.

The motives for these cyberattacks can vary. For some, as is the case
with ransomware attacks, the gains could be purely financial. Others,
however, might have more malicious intentions.

Montenegro, a NATO member since 2017 and an EU hopeful, held elections
at the end of August. Fearing a reprisal of meddling attempts like the
one that the Balkan country suffered in 2016, when a Russia-backed
attempted coup took place, Montenegrin authorities held a joint mission
with cybersecurity experts from the United States toward the end of
2019.

The mission aimed to prepare both sides for any possible Russian hacking
attempts that could target the election processes in the two countries.
However, as a recent suspected Russian hacking attack on U.S. government
agencies showed, this might not be such an easy task---no matter how
developed or technologically advanced a country might be.

"This was a cunning cyber-espionage campaign that was very hard to
detect. It reveals that the U.S. government needs to enhance its
cyberdefenses," said Bilyana Lilly, an assistant policy researcher at
Rand Corp.

Even if the U.S. government itself remains vulnerable, **[Washington is
a cyberpower that can aid smaller countries.]{.underline}** Various U.S.
agencies can assist Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, and other U.S.
partners in the region, and they have done so on multiple occasions,
Lilly explained.

**[In the [Balkans]{.mark}, a region [known for its political and
economic instability, cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** on state
institutions **[[could]{.mark} be used to [fuel tensions among]{.mark}
the many [countries that have ongoing disputes]{.mark}, which could in
turn have political and economic consequences.]{.underline}**

The 2014 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**)
Wales Summit further **[affirmed]{.underline}** the UNGGE
recommendations by maintaining that "international law, including
international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in
cyberspace." NATO's assertion is categorical---cyberspace will not be a
lawless space. **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** also
**[[determined]{.underline}]{.mark}** that cyber attacks could threaten
national security and stability, holding that "**[[cyber]{.mark} defence
[is part of]{.mark} NATO's core task of collective
defence]{.underline}**" **[meriting case-by-case [Article 5]{.mark}
consideration]{.underline}**.13 It is worth noting that **[[neither the
UN nor NATO]{.mark} yet [specifies a specific "red line"]{.mark}
response [threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}**, automatically determining
retaliation and strategic options. **[[Without]{.mark}
established]{.underline}** and recognized
**[[norms]{.underline}]{.mark}** of cyber behavior to frame the use of
national instruments of power, "**[[We could be forced to]{.mark}
live]{.underline}** in the worst of all possible cyber
worlds---routinely **[[vulnerable to attack]{.mark} and self restrained
from bringing our own power to bear]{.underline}**."14

There is also significant policy context necessary for any US cyber
response. The US International Strategy for Cyberspace holds that
existing Internet governance bodies should continue to guide and shape
the development of the Internet.15 The US strategy is aimed at
continuing the Internet tradition of innovation, rather than a competing
vision of state control. The United States desires to ensure appropriate
representation from governments, academia, and private and civil
sectors.16 US policy makers insist on not conflating control over
standards and protocols with a perceived (by some) need for sovereign
ability to act unilaterally or multilaterally in cyberspace to preserve
vital national interests.

Policy makers and strategists must likewise endeavor to stay informed by
and ahead of technology. In this way, **[[there must be consensus
about]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[distinguishing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
among sophisticated **[cybercrime]{.underline}**, ubiquitous cyber
**[espionage]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[[legitimate
cyberwarfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[The]{.underline}** current
**[[blurred lines]{.underline}]{.mark}** among these three
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** often **[[used by
adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}** in cyberspace **[[to disguise and
obscure intent]{.underline}]{.mark}** and patronage.17 States should
also realize that **[[policy decisions in cyberspace will]{.mark} likely
[have international consequences due to
interconnectedness]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and there should be
understood requirements for "global interoperability, network stability,
reliable access, multi-stakeholder governance, and cybersecurity due
diligence."18 **[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** well-informed spirit of
transparency in policy **[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** help
**[[mitigate the fog of war]{.underline}]{.mark}** inherent in cyber
incidents **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** potentially **[[avert
unnecessary conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.19 The political landscape
and societal contexts are not the only considerations. There is also the
development of the US whole-of-government approach to respond to cyber
attack.

**[and]{.underline}** **[entrepreneurship]{.underline}** **[in the field
[is]{.mark} also a [tangible]{.mark} reality,]{.underline}** **[due to
the necessary research and development methods]{.underline}**. More so,
the possibility of an open market economy sharing of knowledge and
technological skills makes security and cyber-security or defense for
that matter more attractive. **[What [lacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in
the world wide [legal and political]{.mark} [framework of
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[exchange of
info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}** and protectiveness from new sources
or methods that can be deemed as elements of infiltration.

The article's aim is to examine and recommend a global strategic
framework for operational capacity and management resilience between
allied and cooperative partners in the field of cyber-security. The
current article is a follow up of prior scientific publications made in
2014 first and later in 2018, on NATO's cyber-security strategy,
presented through a framework of Cyber-Development, Cyber-Democracy, and
Cyber-Defense (Carayannis, Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2014; Carayannis,
Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2018). The aim is to converge diversified
information on cyber-security, in a single strategic framework; reflect
to the actual practical needs in understanding operations and tactical
ability to deliver in multi-complex and dimensional world through
management and operational efficiency capabilities. The article requests
interoperability of aims and objectives under a global framework of
cyber-security; through a strategic framework on cyber-security, global
law can be proposed, defined, and adopted by the international
community. The [**[strategic framework]{.underline}** **[will define
structures]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that are [needed]{.mark} to be put
in place]{.underline}** on a global scale, **[when reflecting issues of
cyber-security]{.underline}** and inclusive **[[for
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It will define threats and challenges, as
cyber-attacks are real. **[Cyber-security is not an
asymmetrical]{.underline}** or hybrid **[threat, but an existential
one.]{.underline}** Its destructive capacity can be multi-leveled and
can also lead to human casualties. The future of e-safety lays at both a
global estimation framework of what constitutes cyber-security and how
we react to it; it lays in between cooperation of allies and members of
wider alliances, against specified or approximate threats. **[Yet, its
framework of aims and objectives, management, command and control, and
operations will be defined and decided by allied parties]{.underline}**
only **[such as]{.underline}** is the case of **[NATO.]{.underline}**

**[[Operationally]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[national]{.underline}]{.mark}** and cooperative **[[forces]{.mark}
[need to be]{.mark} continuously [agile and technologically
advanced]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[In an asymmetrical world, which is
complete with unforeseen challenges and threats, we need forces with
flexibility]{.underline}**, **[adaptability]{.underline}**,
**[operational and strategic command structure,]{.underline}** based on
high technologically sophisticated information "coming in," but also
being used while in training or through active operations.

On a theoretical scale, the current **[article requests a cyber-security
strategic framework]{.underline}** **[adoption of
resilient]{.underline}** **[adaptability]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[interoperability policy]{.underline}** in the
framework of safety and defense. The article considers that
**[understanding the realities of threats is]{.underline}** by
definition **[a natural innovation and as we move ahead,]{.underline}**
we structure and operate a single strategy on cyber-security against a
virtual threat from wherever it comes from. **[Its long-term [resilience
may be]{.mark} more [complex]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[as operational
capacity]{.mark} [needs to]{.mark} constantly develop and
[adapt]{.mark}]{.underline}** into the convergence of societal
structures, and methods; where socio-economic, technological, defense
even health, and education issues are affected.

**[When theory on cyber-security, resilience, and operational capacity
will be applied at NATOs level, it will enable allies and members,
jointly, to create a true policy and]{.underline}**
**[strategy]{.underline}** **[for cyber-security
resilience]{.underline}** **[against hybrid virtual
threats]{.underline}**. The methodology on how to is presented through
this current article.

The article's design is based on cross-disciplinary and
interdisciplinary approaches. It combines elements of global security
and strategy, national and international law, economic development, and
technological research and advancement and most importantly is
innovative and entrepreneurial; its understanding will enable us to
comprehend global and regional market establishment and convergence, as
also economic changes. The setting of the study required lapse of time
to showcase the need and the necessity of the subject. Current output
reflects a set of written analyses, rules, and primary experiences. It
methodologically acquired sources of information of related necessity
and relevance, shaped the understanding, and need to point out for a
framework of rules, regulations, management, and operations on
cyber-security.

The article and its author frames a specific policy recommendation with
regards to the creation of not only a regional alliance (NATO-based
scale), Cyber-Security Strategy for the twenty-first century but a
global one. The article defines the "dynamism" of cyber-security both as
a topic and subject. Cyber-security is a twenty-first century element of
policy orientation; a necessity for both collective and individual
defense and security resilience.

Finally, **[[NATO needs to maintain ambiguity on what justifies an
Article 5 response.]{.underline}]{.mark}** As mentioned previously,
**[ambiguity has served NATO well. [A set threshold for]{.mark} when
NATO will invoke an Article 5 [response to a cyber-attack]{.mark} on a
member country [is not necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
**[ambiguity has historically served the alliance well, [as demonstrated
by]{.mark} the [9/11]{.mark} attacks. [If the alliance]{.mark} had [said
weapons]{.mark} were [only include guns,]{.mark} bullets, [tanks, and
bombs, it would]{.mark} have set a threshold [preclud]{.mark}ing a NATO
response to attacks that turned four planes into [improvised
missiles.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[The larger issue of ambiguity is
that there is no set definition of what constitutes an armed attack and
what circumstances dictate a collective response, as per Article 5.
[Remaining ambiguous]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the severity threshold of
a cyber-attack **[[allows the alliance to act in]{.mark} cases of future
cyber-[attacks that cause severe damage, but also]{.mark} allow NATO to
[refrain from over-reacting]{.mark}, even if an event is a cyber, or
kinetic, attack as per a definition. [It would be a mistake to set a
threshold for attacks that cannot]{.mark} currently [be
anticipated.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[understand how to stay below that]{.underline}** threshold. **[This
would]{.underline}** strengthen deterrence of threats above the
threshold but would **[encourage the opponent to [increase attacks just
below the threshold.]{.mark}]{.underline}** A certain degree of
**[[ambiguity is beneficial because it could make opponents wary of

**[[Since]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} world is]{.underline}** still **[so
new]{.underline}** **[and [continues to advance]{.mark} each day
[with]{.mark} new [tech]{.mark}nologies, NATO is still trying to find

response to the new threats to peace and democracy that cyber-attacks
pose on the alliance]{.underline}** and this new world. **[NATO welcomes
and many experts on cyberspace give it recommendations on how to deal
with this new threat. The [cyber world is too new for NATO to bind its
hands]{.mark}]{.underline}**, so to speak**[[,
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** rigid **[[rules and laws regarding when,
how, and why it would invoke Article 5]{.mark} in the case of a
cyber-attack]{.underline}** on a member country. In response, **[at the
2014 summit in Wales, the alliance made it clear that a cyber-attack can
and will invoke an Article 5 response. It also made it clear that
ambiguity has served the alliance well, and [it refused to define the
kind of attack]{.mark} that would invoke an Article 5
response.]{.underline}**

However, **[[that is not to say]{.mark} that [NATO has been
irresponsible]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[or lackadaisical in trying to
give some understanding on when a cyber-attack becomes an armed attack.

it.]{.underline}** Although **[the Manual offers [guidance on]{.mark}
what [scale, effects, and]{.mark} attacker [motivation]{.mark} would be
severe enough to fall into the category of an armed attack, [it does not
give specific details, only a conceptual idea]{.mark} of what an armed
attack might look like in]{.underline}** the **[cyber]{.underline}**
realm. Then, **[with the guidance of the Manual, and
i]{.underline}**nternational **[law, there could be a better

Alexander **Lanoszka 20**, PhD, Assistant Professor in the Department of
Political Science, Balsillie School of International Affairs, University
of Waterloo, "Thank goodness for NATO enlargement", Int Polit (2020)
57:451-470

The defensibility of NATO's northeastern flank NATO enlargement has
provided a key source of insurance by raising the costs of direct
Russian aggression against alliance members. This is true even in
arguably the weakest part of the alliance, the Baltic littoral region.
Conventional wisdom holds that the defense of this region against
Russian aggression is especially costly for the USA and NATO to
undertake. The countries located there are exceptionally vulnerable.
Whereas most benefciaries of NATO enlargement are at least largely
separated from Russia thanks to Belarus and Ukraine, the Baltic
countries are directly contiguous and have only a short land connection
to continental NATO by way of the Polish--Lithuanian border. According
to this perspective, a rebalancing of alliance commitments in Europe is
necessary because the local military balance favors Russia too much and
the political will to defend the Baltic states is too low. The USA will
never 'trade Toledo for Tallinn' (Shifrinson 2017, 111). Note the
contradiction: According to critics, enlarging NATO simultaneously
provokes Russia and weakens the alliance. But what rational cause would
Russia have to be dismayed when a potentially adversarial military
alliance willingly takes on major liabilities? The alliance security
dilemma---whereby the strengthening of one coalition may inadvertently
create insecurity for another---suggests that Russia would be
justifiably concerned if NATO either incorporated states that
meaningfully aggregate capabilities or increased military ties with such
powerful states (Snyder 1984, 477). By NATO enlargement critics' own
admission, the Baltic countries subtract from, rather than add to, what
the alliance can do. Russian might have reasons to protest enlargement,
but these reasons likely concern the perceived slight to its honor when
former Soviet states became formal defense partners of the USA (Götz
2017, 236--239).4 NATO enlargement has not been responsible for Russian
authoritarianism or international revisionism because it never
threatened Russia. Pessimism regarding the defensibility of NATO's
so-called northeastern flank is also unwarranted. To begin with, much of
the policy literature on this region concentrates on Russia's strengths
while ignoring its key weaknesses. The Baltic countries would almost
surely lose set piece battles against Russia, but deterrence ultimately
hinges less on being victorious in a potential war than on imposing
unacceptable costs on the adversary. The Baltic states have already
begun embracing unconventional strategies intended to boost national
resiliency and make occupation difficult (Collins and Beehner 2019).
Guerrilla tactics and territorial defense serve to augment their denial
capabilities that in turn would complicate Russian efforts to hold
territory and pacify the local population. Moreover, **[[Russia may have
local]{.mark} escalation dominance]{.underline}**[, **[but it
does]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[not have global escalation
dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[given the forces that NATO members
possess]{.underline}**. **[A [large-scale land grab]{.mark} made at the
expense of any of the Baltic countries [might precipitate escalatory
dynamics that it could not control]{.mark}. Nuclear war]{.underline}**
may be a remote possibility, but it **[cannot be discounted
altogether]{.underline}**. **[[One reason why Russia has resorted
to]{.mark} so-called [hybrid tactics]{.mark} against the Baltic
countries]{.underline}**---**[such as political subversion and eforts to
foment unrest]{.underline}**---**[[is that it does not wish to provoke a
reaction]{.mark} that [it cannot handle]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Lanoszka
2016). **[Put simply, [Russia may believe in]{.mark} NATO's [Article
Five]{.mark} collective defense commitment [more than NATO members
themselves do.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Neg---AT: Cyber Aff---Deterrence Turn---2NC

#### Redlines embolden aggression *[more]{.underline}* than clarity [AND]{.underline} jeopardize [NATO's credibility]{.underline}

Z'hra M. **Ghavam 16**---Lieutenant Commander, United States Navy, B.S.,
United States Naval Academy. (\"NATO's Preparedness for Cyberwar,\"
September 2016, <https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/50552>)

**[[NATO's]{.mark} publicly declared [policy on cyber threats is
consciously and purposefully vague]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}207
Why? **[Strategic ambiguity has]{.underline}** its
**[benefits.]{.underline}** According to the Atlantic Council panel,
**[[there is no "redline"]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[or "determined
threshold" [that would automatically define a cyber act]{.mark} as an
act of war.]{.underline}**208 **[[Leaving]{.mark} the [rules undefined
affords NATO ample room]{.mark} in which to operate. For a 28-member
multinational organization that operates on the principle of consensus,
time and latitude for solidifying strategic-level decisions are
critical. [If NATO publicized a cyber redline, it would box the Alliance
into a corner. This]{.mark} kind of policy [could embolden cyber
offenders and provoke massive intrusions that target]{.mark} NATO's
networks at [just below this threshold.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[Having a defined redline could]{.underline}]{.mark}** also
**[[invite nefarious]{.mark} cyber [actors to cross it to test NATO's
resolve, damage its reputation as a leader]{.mark} in Euro-Atlantic
security[, and undermine the credibility of]{.mark} its [Article 5
commitments.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Following the Wales Summit in 2014, **[NATO affirmed its stance on law
and cyberspace while refusing to address cyber redlines:]{.underline}**

**[Our policy also recognizes that i]{.underline}**nternational **[law,
including]{.underline}** international **[humanitarian law and the UN
Charter, applies in cyberspace. Cyber attacks can reach a threshold that
threatens national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security, and
stability.]{.underline}** Their impact could be as harmful to modern
societies as a conventional attack. **[We affirm, therefore, that cyber
defense is part of NATO's core task of collective
defense.]{.underline}** A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead
to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic
Council on a case-by-case basis.209

However, an **[invocation of Article 5 does not necessarily mean that a
NATO response would include force.]{.underline}** Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty states the following:

**[The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
and]{.underline}** consequently they **[agree]{.underline}** that,
**[if]{.underline}** such **[an armed attack occurs, each of them, in
exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense
recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will
assist the Party]{.underline}** or Parties so attacked by taking
forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such
action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.210

Thus, **[as long as each Alliance member takes "such action as it deems
necessary," it cannot be found in violation of the collective defense
principle.]{.underline}**211 In the case of a major act of cyberwar
against one of its members, **[NATO could invoke Article 5 as a show of
solidarity but opt to refrain from employing kinetic military
force]{.underline}**; instead, **[the Alliance could use purely
cybernetic means or a hybrid alternative that combined cybernetic tools
with military force to fulfill its objectives.]{.underline}**

**[In all, [NATO's]{.mark} establishment, organization, and employment
of its [sophisticated]{.mark} cyber [response agencies]{.mark} and IT
resources like the NCIRC, NCIO, NCIA, and RRT are [indicat]{.mark}ive of
[how seriously the Alliance]{.mark} has [implemented]{.mark} its [cyber
defense]{.mark} policies at the operational level. [NATO's]{.mark} cyber
[policy,]{.mark} standard operating [procedures, and ambiguous
thresholds]{.mark} for the use of military force [make the Alliance
highly prepared to respond effectively to]{.mark} major acts of [cyber
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}** against one or more of its members. If
an act of cyberwar met the threshold of an armed attack, **[NATO
would]{.underline}** probably **[be prepared to manage, counter, and
resolve the issue in cyberspace]{.underline}**; still, **[one cannot
exclude the possible need to take kinetic measures. Out of a numerical
ranking of 1--3, the Alliance earned a preparedness score of 3 in cyber
strategy.]{.underline}**

**[In light of]{.underline}** the **[recent developments]{.underline}**
of NATO, **[[it would]{.underline}]{.mark}** seem to [**[be in NATO's
best interest to remain ambiguous]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and allow
the organization to approach its response to a cyber-attack on a
case-by-case basis.]{.underline}** For instance, the **[[attacks on
Estonia might require intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}** on behalf of
the Estonian **[people [due to the fact they are]{.mark} a
[smaller]{.mark}, lesser defensible state. Estonia would not be
successful standing up against Russia]{.underline}**, and **[as Russia
becomes more aggressive in the former-Soviet bloc region]{.underline}**,
small states like Estonia are at risk. **[If another attack were to
occur against Estonia, the attacks would have to be more severe to
invoke an Article 5 response]{.underline}**. **[Such a response would
enable NATO states to act as if they too have been attacked as per the
mutual defense announcement against cyber-attacks]{.underline}** at the
Wales Summit. **[Yet, [if the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[is attacked in a similar manner, there]{.mark} likely [does not need
to be the same]{.mark} scale of [defense]{.mark} taken[, because the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[has
more resources]{.mark} and capabilities]{.underline}** to respond on its
own. **[[Remaining ambiguous allows NATO to choose the best
opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[for supporting and
defending]{.underline}** member states.

**[Before it could decide on a response, [NATO would]{.mark} first need
to [consider]{.mark} the [severity of the attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[to determine]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[appropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}** level of **[[response,]{.mark}
whether it be [sanctions, cutting off]{.mark} financial [aid]{.mark} to
the offending country[, or]{.mark} a [boots on the ground]{.mark}
campaign.]{.underline}** However, **[[even while retaining
flexibility]{.mark} in its response to a cyber-attack[, NATO understands
the importance of cyber defense. It aims to deter]{.mark} cyber-attacks
against its networks and member country's networks [through
strong]{.mark} cyber [defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}**, although NATO has
yet to fully seek what Cold War theorists have called "deterrence by
denial," and which could be an effective mechanism.161 With such a
posture, the enemy need not be convinced that a cyber-attack will be
followed by retaliation or punishment; instead, it is only necessary to
convince the enemy that the initial attack will have no effect.16

**[NATO's ambiguity also extends to]{.underline}** the type of
**[punishment]{.underline}** **[it threatens]{.underline}** were it
**[to]{.underline}** suffer **[a cyber attack. The [Alliance]{.mark} has
[made clear]{.mark} that [it neither limits

**[[cyber attacks nor excludes them.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Instead,
**[[it keeps the option]{.mark} open [to use the full range of Allied
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[to deter and
counter]{.underline}]{.mark}** cyber attacks. Once again, **[[this
introduces useful doubt in an opponent's mind.]{.mark} A]{.underline}**
more **[technical reason for the difficulty of restricting retaliation
to cyber attacks is that [it is hard to credibly threaten]{.mark} the
[assets]{.mark} of the attacker in a similar fashion. [If an attacker
shuts down a power plant, would the Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}** have
cyber options to **[[attack]{.mark} an opponent's power plants
or]{.underline}** **[[similar infrastructure? Would NATO]{.mark} even
[want to if it could]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as it complies with the
principle of proportionality and international law in all its
activities**[[? NATO's ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the type of
retaliation **[[serves a convincing purpose. It produces doubts]{.mark}

Between the United States of America and Russia"

On the other hand, **[[both]{.mark} states might [not desire]{.mark}
further [escalation]{.mark}, preferring to restrain the conflict to
cyberspace]{.underline}**. **[Each would follow the "tit-for-tat" logic
and accuse each other]{.underline}** **[while [never reaching]{.mark} a
tipping point where the conflict spills over to a [conventional]{.mark}
war]{.underline}**. Such a tipping point would be linked to the
intensity of the attack or the nature of the targets. **[Both
[nations]{.mark} would [keep]{.mark} the [cyberattacks small]{.mark}
enough not to trigger a bigger reaction. The same would be observed on
the choice of targets, with both avoiding certain critical or sensitive
targets, for instance critical infrastructures.]{.underline}** In order
to contain the conflict in cyberspace, both states would have **[[to
demonstrate]{.mark} their [restraint]{.mark} by selecting [options with
low]{.mark} risk of [miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}** (Lin, 2012,
pp. 64--66). In the future, **[it might also be possible to [see]{.mark}
a [deescalation in]{.mark} the form of the emergence of an international
treaty or at least further bilateral [treaties between]{.mark} the [USA
and Russia]{.mark} on cyberattacks]{.underline}**. For example, during
the last few years, businesses in the USA were often hacked and spied on
by the Chinese military. These intrusions were mostly
cyber-economic-espionage and were said to have supported the theft of
billions of dollars' worth of intellectual property (Bamford, 2016).
**[In]{.underline}** September **[2015, the USA and China signed an
agreement engaging both countries not to support or conduct cyber-theft
of intellectual property]{.underline}**. Moreover, the parties have made
the commitment not to use cyberattacks against each other's critical
infrastructures in peace-time and to support the establishment of
international behavioral norms in cyberspace (Rosenfeld, 2015). **[Both
states also highlighted the fact that they could not control each
individual in their country and therefore could not be held responsible
for individual acts.]{.underline}** Since then it seems that the number
of attacks on commercial targets has diminished (Timm, 2016). Former
President Obama suggested the creation of a position of cybersecurity
ambassador to deal with bilateral or multilateral treaties concerning
cyber-norms (Lee, 2016). For this kind of de-escalation to take effect,
the termination of the conflict at hand must be the stated aim of both
parties. A clear common understanding of the terms of agreement is
required and must be based on trust-building efforts, as well as the
assurance of mutual adherence. The difficulty of tracking the
implementation of such agreements in cyberspace has been an obstacle
preventing more states consenting to such solutions (Lin, 2012, pp.
62--64). Nevertheless, **[a [dialogue on cyberspace]{.mark} already
[exists]{.mark} between the USA and Russia]{.underline}** since July
2013. This **[[cooperation includes]{.underline}]{.mark}** Confidence
Building Measures (**[[CBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[such as the
creation of working groups on the issue of ICT security, exchange of
information between the two national]{.underline}** Computer Emergency
Response Teams ([**[CERT]{.underline}**), **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[the creation of a [direct communication]{.mark} line [to]{.mark}
directly [manage]{.mark} ICT [incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Segal,
2016; The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 2013). In October
2016, former President Obama used the latter to inform Russian President
Putin that the USA was accusing Russia of interference in the election
process (Ignatius, 2016). Furthermore, Russia and the USA take part in
the UN GGE supporting the future establishment of international norms on
actions in cyberspace. **[They stated that international law can be
applied in cyberspace and therefore, the rules of proportionality and
limited collateral damage should also be respected in
cyberattacks]{.underline}** (Ignatius, 2016; United Nations General
Assembly, 2015). These examples demonstrate that **[even though the two
states are involved in a "tit-for-tat" logic in their relations on a
tactical level, [there was]{.mark} still a [dialogue on the strategic
level]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least until 2015. The recent
cyberattacks in USA and the election of Donald Trump as US President,
bring new uncertainties.

#### No nuclear retaliation 

**Tucker 18** (Patrick; Feb 2; Technology Editor for Defense One, MA
from Johns Hopkins University, BA from Sarah Lawrence College, Former
Deputy Editor for The Futurist; "No, the US Won't Respond to A Cyber
Attack with Nukes,"
https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/02/no-us-wont-respond-cyber-attack-nukes/145700)

**[[No]{.mark}, the [US Won't Respond to]{.mark} A [Cyber]{.mark} Attack
[with Nukes]{.mark}]{.underline}** Defense leaders won't completely rule
out the possibility. **[But [it's]{.mark} a very, very, [very
remote]{.mark} possibility]{.underline}**. **[The idea that the U.S. is
building]{.underline}** new **[low-yield nuclear weapons to respond to a
cyber attack is "not true,"]{.underline}** military leaders told
reporters in the runup to the Friday release of the new Nuclear Posture
Review. "The people who say we lowered the threshold for the use of
nuclear weapons are saying, 'but we want these low-yield nuclear weapons
so that we can answer a cyber attack because we're so bad at cyber
security.' That's just fundamentally not true," Gen. Paul Selva, vice
chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday at a meeting with
reporters. **[It's an [idea]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[military
[leaders]{.mark} have been [push]{.mark}ing [back against]{.mark} since
the New York Times ran a]{.underline}** Jan. 16 [**story headlined,
"Pentagon Suggests Countering Devastating Cyberattacks With Nuclear
Arms."**]{.underline} When would the U.S. launch a nuclear attack in
response to a non-nuclear event? The Defense Department says **[[the
threshold hasn't changed]{.mark} since]{.underline}** the
**[Obama]{.underline}** administration's own nuclear posture review in
2010, but a draft of the new review that leaked online caused a bit of
drama in its attempts to dispel "ambiguity." The new review gives
examples of "non-nuclear strategic attacks," Robert Soofer, deputy
assistant secretary for nuclear and missile defense policy, told
reporters on Thursday. "It could be catastrophic attacks against
civilian populations, against infrastructure. It could be an attack
using a non-nuclear weapon against our nuclear command-and-control
\[or\] early-warning satellites. But **[[we don't talk about
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**." In his own conversation with reporters,
Selva broadened "early warning" systems to include ones that provide
"indications of warning that are important to our detection of an
attack." He also emphasized, "We never said 'cyber.'" **[There's a
reason for that]{.underline}**. While **[[cyber]{.mark}
attacks]{.underline}** on physical infrastructure can be very dangerous,
they **[[are unlikely to kill enough]{.mark} people [to provoke
a]{.mark} U.S. nuclear [response]{.mark}]{.underline}**. An National
Academies of Science and Engineering analysis of the vulnerability of
U.S. infrastructure makes that point. **[A]{.underline}** major **[cyber
attack could cut off electrical power]{.underline}**, resulting in
"people dying from heat or cold exposure, etc.," said Granger Morgan,
co-director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and one
of the chairs of the report. "A large outage of long duration could
cover many states and last for weeks or longer. Whether and how many
casualties there could be would depend on things like what the weather
was during the outage." **[It's]{.underline}** a huge problem but
**[[not]{.mark} an event [resulting in]{.mark} tens of [thousands
of]{.mark} immediate [deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Contrast that with
a nuclear attack on a city like Moscow, even one using a device of 6
kilotons, much smaller than the ones the United States used against
Japanese targets in World War II. The immediate result: there would be
40,000 deaths, according to the online nuclear simulation tool NukeMap.
**[Russia]{.underline}** has **[demonstrated]{.underline}** a
**[willingness]{.underline}** to take down power services with cyber
attacks, as they did in Ukraine on Christmas Eve 2015.
**[But]{.underline}** these **[[attacks were brief and occured
in]{.mark} the context of [actual fighting]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
other words, **[the [worst]{.mark}]{.underline}** cyber physical
**[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[top experts believe credible
likely [does not meet the threshold]{.mark} that the [Defense]{.mark}
Department [has]{.mark} set out [for]{.mark} deploying [a
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon]{.underline}**.

#### Cyber-attacks won't take down the grid

**Craig 16** (Victoria; Feb 2; Analyst at Fox Business, Citing the

Power Grid is \'Vulnerable,\' But Don\'t Panic Just Yet",
http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/02/02/u-s-power-grid-is-vulnerable-but-dont-panic-just-yet.html)

The idea of the nation\'s power grids becoming the next battleground for
cyber warriors could make hacking into consumers' credit card accounts
and personal information seem like child's play. **[While U.S. power
companies are likely targeted by foreign governments]{.underline}** and
others in increasingly sophisticated breaches, **[actually [shutting
off]{.mark} the lights]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}** **[causing
chaos]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[far more
[complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[than many pundits make
it seem.]{.underline}** Dan **[Scali]{.underline}**, **[senior manager
of industrial control systems at Mandiant, a cybersecurity consulting
arm of FireEye
([FEYE](http://www.foxbusiness.com/quote.html?stockTicker=FEYE)),]{.underline}**
**[explained]{.underline}** that **[while cyber criminals]{.underline}**
**[may gain [access]{.mark} to power and utility data
systems]{.underline}**, **[it]{.underline}**
**[[doesn't]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily
**[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[the result will be [a]{.mark} power
[outage]{.mark} and a total takedown of power grid control
systems.]{.underline}** In other words, **[the power [grid is]{.mark}
controlled by [more than just]{.mark} a panel of digital [buttons.
]{.mark}]{.underline}**["**[Losing]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the
[control]{.mark} system is bad]{.underline}** from the perspective that
it takes you out of your normal mode of operations of being able to
control everything from one command center, **[but]{.underline}** **[it
[doesn't mean]{.mark} you've lost control or all the [lights go
out]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[in the city\]," Scali explained. While many
of the systems have been modernized to include digitized control panels,
**[if a hacker were to infiltrate the system, [a utility worker could
still]{.mark} have the ability to]{.underline}** **[[manually
control]{.mark} the [machines]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}**[by]{.underline}** **[flipping a switch]{.underline}**,
pushing a button, or tripping a breaker. As the world saw with the
recent attack in Ukraine, which caused a blackout for 80,000 customers
of the nation's western utility, the biggest problem may be ensuring the
power grid's control systems are not vulnerable to cyber break ins. The
January attack in Ukraine was likely caused by a corrupted Microsoft
Word attachment that allowed remote control over the computer, according
to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Scali said **[[there was no
ev]{.mark}idence from the incident in Ukraine that the hacker's
[malware]{.mark} was able to physically [shut down]{.mark} the
[power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "It wiped out machines, deleted all the
files. Kill disk malware made it impossible to remotely control things.
It caused chaos on the business network, and the area where control
system operations sat. But the attacker, we believe, would have had to
actually used the control system to cause load shedding, which caused
the power to go out, or trip breakers to cause the actual problem.
Malware itself didn't turn the power out," Scali said. He said what most
likely happened in that incident was the hacker stole user credentials
and logged into the system remotely. The bottom line: Yes, a similar
event could happen in the U.S. And corporate America is concerned. A
recent survey released in January on the state of information security,
conducted by consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers, showed
cybersecurity as one of the biggest concerns among the top brass at U.S.
power and utilities firms. Part of the problem, Brad Bauch, security and
cyber sector leader at PwC said, is the interconnectedness of the
industry's tools. "Utilities want to be able to get information out of
\[their\] systems to more efficiently operate them, and also share that
information with customers so they have more real-time information into
their usage," he explained. While allowing access to their own
consumption data allows the companies to give their customers more of
what they want, it also opens up a host of access points for hackers,
making the systems more vulnerable than they otherwise would be. But
**[[to say]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} power [grid is susceptible to
cyber]{.mark} hackers [is]{.mark} a bit of an
[oversimplification]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### No Russian war

But **[conventional wisdom is]{.underline}** often
**[wrong]{.underline}**, and so it is this time. The
**[[hysteria]{.underline}]{.mark}** that has engulfed public commentary
throughout Europe about this ostensibly dire military situation on the
brink of getting out of hand **[[has little]{.mark}, if any,
[basis]{.mark} in fact. Both [sides]{.mark} in the standoff
[exaggerate]{.mark} the [tensions and]{.mark} the [danger]{.mark} of
escalation]{.underline}**, and the risks of the military moves---their
own and their adversary's---supposedly driving these tensions.

In reality, **[the military [balance]{.mark} between Russia and NATO [is
stable]{.mark}, the danger of [escalation is hardly]{.mark} approaching
[critical]{.mark} levels]{.underline}**, and **[little needs to be done
militarily to defuse the current tensions. The true [cause of]{.mark}
the [tensions is not military, but political]{.mark} and diplomatic.
Until those causes are resolved, [tensions]{.mark} between Russia and
the West will [remain high]{.mark}. The [likelihood of]{.mark} a
military [confrontation]{.mark} will remain [low]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
however, **[[because neither]{.mark} side's [posture points
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** a heightened state of readiness or
**[[intent]{.mark}ion [to go on]{.mark} the
[offensive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Until that changes, **[political and
diplomatic [tensions]{.mark} will [remain]{.mark} mere
[tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Deterrence and norms solve cyberattacks

Moral Imperative." Philosophy & Technology,

3.4 **[The Failure of Cyber Deterrence? The potency of cyber deterrence
is difficult to judge]{.underline}**. This is partly **[because there
exists no consensus on what constitutes an act of
sufficient]{.underline}** cyber **[aggression]{.underline}**. Therefore,
it is not entirely clear what is to be deterred. Where exactly the
threshold for response should be will be discussed in section three of
this paper. **[For now]{.underline}**, we can state that **[low-level
[nuisance attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[are]{.mark} a
[daily]{.mark} occurrence]{.underline}**. For example, U.S. military
networks are probed and scanned millions of times each day (Work 2015,
1). Similarly, **[acts of cyber espionage are reasonably
common]{.underline}**. **[[However]{.mark}, what is also [evident is the
lack of major]{.mark} cyber [attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For a
while, Stuxnet, Wiper, Shamoon and Bronze Soldier appeared to signal the
rise of cyber attack as a potent new instrument of policy. However,
**[medium to [large]{.mark}-scale [attacks]{.mark} have essentially
[dried-up]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Indeed, reflecting the empirical
evidence, and marking a shift in tone, in his]{.underline}** September
**[2015 testimony]{.underline}** to the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Director of National Intelligence, James [**[Clapper]{.underline}**,
**[talked down]{.underline}**]{.mark} the possibility of **[[an
'electronic Pearl Harbor']{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead, he focused on
ongoing 'low-to-moderate' level threats (Clapper 2015, 2). What does
this all tell us? **[Is deterrence working?]{.underline}** If one
considers low-to-moderate threats as deterrable, then the answer would
seem to be no. From this perspective, and according to some policy
makers, deterrence is already failing. In a 2015 Senate Armed Services
Committee Hearing, Chairman John McCain was scathing in his assessment:
'Our adversaries view our response \... as timid and ineffectual. Put
simply, the problem is a lack of deterrence. The administration has not
demonstrated to our adversaries that the consequence of continued cyber
attacks against us outweigh the benefit.' (Takala 2015) However, **[if
we take the view that cyber [deterrence should]{.mark}]{.underline}**
really **[[concern itself only with large]{.mark}-scale
[attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[the picture is]{.underline}** more
**[positive]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[Valeriano and
[Maness]{.mark}]{.underline}** (2015) have
**[[identified]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[considerable]{.underline}**
levels of [**[restraint]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[state [cyber behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This could be **[[due
to]{.mark} a [lack of confidence in the]{.mark} strategic [utility
of]{.mark} cyber [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[It may also
reflect]{.mark} the development of [norms]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[against aggressive]{.underline}** forms of **[cyber behaviour
[and]{.mark} the efficacy of [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[norms]{.underline}** increasingly **[form part of 'complex
deterrence', within which military and non-military elements operate
together]{.underline}**. In cyberspace, although a settled understanding
of universal rules of behaviour is still lacking, **[[norms]{.mark}
appear to be [crystalis]{.mark}ing [around
acceptable]{.mark}]{.underline}** forms of [**[intrusion]{.underline}**
**[rather than]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a blanket [non-use]{.mark}
position]{.underline}** (Stevens 2012, 25). **[[This]{.mark} may
[explain]{.mark} the continuance of [lowlevel probes]{.mark} whilst
large attacks have trailed off.]{.underline}**

Unlikely. First off, [**[there are three separate grids]{.underline}**
**[in the]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}**: **[[the
Eastern]{.mark} Interconnect]{.underline}**, **[[the Western]{.mark}
Interconnect, [and Texas]{.mark}]{.underline}** (called ERCOT). Yes,
Texas is its own entity. Don\'t act surprised. **[[You can take an
electron]{.mark} and run it [from Louisiana to Maine, but]{.mark} [you
can\'t go to Houston or San Francisco]{.mark}. Several changes were made
due to the Northeast Blackout of 2003. [The grid operates on a principle
of redundancy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[to avoid cascading
failures]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[When a power line
fails]{.underline}**, **[[the electrons near-instantaneously]{.mark} [go
to other lines]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[If the addition of those
electrons cause these lines to overload and fail]{.underline}**, the
failures will continue like a domino effect. **[The [operators]{.mark}
of the grid]{.underline}**, using fancy software, [**[manage the
grid]{.underline}** **[so that]{.underline}** **[no single
failure]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[leads]{.mark} [to a cascading
failure]{.mark}. If one failure does occur, [they
will]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[make]{.underline}** **[necessary
changes]{.underline}**]{.mark} to prevent another single failure from
causing a cascading failure; **[[that could include a starting reserve
generation]{.mark} in particular areas]{.underline}** (even if that
generating resource is more costly) **[[or by turning off the
power]{.mark}]{.underline}** of select areas.

#### No Russia war -- they won't risk it

from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1983,
"Russia's Nuclear Weapons: Doctrine, Forces, and Modernization",
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R45861.pdf

One analyst has postulated that [**[Russia may actually]{.underline}**
**[raise its nuclear threshold]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[as it
bolsters]{.underline}** its **[conventional forces]{.underline}**.
According to this analyst, "[**[It is difficult to understand
why]{.underline}** **[Russia would]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[want to
[pursue]{.mark} military [adventurism]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[that
would risk]{.mark} all-out [confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[with a technologically advanced]{.mark} and [nuclear-armed adversary
like NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [**[While]{.underline}**
**[opportunistic]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[[and]{.mark} possibly even
[reckless]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[the [Putin]{.mark} regime [does not
appear to be suicidal]{.mark}]{.underline}**." 144 **[As a study
from]{.underline}** the **[RAND]{.underline}** Corporation
**[noted]{.underline}**, **[[Russia has "invested considerable sums in
developing]{.mark} and fielding long-range [conventional]{.mark} strike
[weapons]{.mark} since the mid-2000s [to provide]{.mark} Russian
[leadership with a buffer against]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[reaching
the nuclear threshold]{.underline}**]{.mark}---**[a]{.underline}** set
of conventional escalatory options that can achieve strategic effects
without resorting to nuclear weapons."145 Others note, however, that
Russia has integrated these "conventional precision weapons and nuclear
weapons into a single strategic weapon set," lending credence to the
view that Russia may be prepared to employ, or threaten to employ,
nuclear weapons during a regional conflict.

#### Russia war won't escalate

Destroyed in a Nuclear War Yet?," Nautilus Magazine, 1/15/2018,
<http://nautil.us/blog/-why-hasnt-the-world-been-destroyed-in-a-nuclear-war-yet>

But after all these nuclear near-misses, one starts to wonder if it
really is plain dumb luck. The Nash equilibrium accurately describes a
certain kind of rational, perfectly logical approach to choices under
conflict. And exactly in keeping with game theorists' advice, the USSR
and U.S. went to great lengths to make sure their arsenals would be
feared as legitimate threats. **[Yet [each time]{.mark}
they]{.underline}** had an opportunity to make good on those
threats---to launch a crushing response to an apparent attack or
mercilessly exploit a weakness, as many armchair analysts
recommended---**[[something held]{.mark} them [back: a disobedient
soldier]{.mark}, a [circumspect engineer]{.mark}, an [optimistic
leader]{.mark}. The two nations]{.underline}** were engaged in a battle
of wills, staring each other in the eyes, and they **[[both blinked.
Repeatedly]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Maybe, when millions of lives hang in the balance, [people are
not]{.mark} so [rationally cold-hearted]{.mark} as those old game-theory
models imply. [Or]{.mark} maybe they're [using]{.mark} a
[different]{.mark} kind of [rationality]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
