#### Military assistance [does not]{.underline} trade off with State Department involvement

OF US FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH SECURITY ASSISTANCE," *Air War College*,

When the three indicators of militarization are applied to DOD's
security assistance efforts, results indicate that [the United States
relies **heavily** on DOD to pursue foreign policy objectives, but **not
at the expense** of State Department responsibilities. DOD uses security
cooperation to build relationships with partner nations and respond to
humanitarian efforts, and uses security assistance as a flexible tool to
build the capacity of foreign military forces so they can respond to
threats in their regions before conditions require a greater US military
response]{.underline}. Whenever possible, [DOD proactively shapes the
global security environment promoting US interests. DOD has the option
to use its new Section 1206 authority to respond to urgent and emerging
threats based on regional command priorities, or to influence
longer-term State Department programs in support of country
requirements]{.underline}. Also, [DOD's considerable force presence and
commander influence can sway security assistance decisions favorably
toward US interests. However, the State Department maintains a **high
degree of direct involvement** and oversight in all security assistance
decisions]{.underline}.

#### Close collaboration is good

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[A key aspect of the success of the security cooperation enterprise is
the **collaboration** among and within the Department, most notably
DoD's close **collaboration** with the State Department ensures that
programs are designed and executed with broader national security
interests in mind]{.underline}. Internal to the Department of Defense,
we recently reorganized -- bringing the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency under the umbrella of Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities in the
Office of the Secretary of the Defense for Policy to facilitate better
collaboration and coordination. Success requires teamwork, and I can
assure you that our entire team is focused on embracing it.

TIMES" <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA589722.pdf>

How we deal with our adversaries is changing in response to these
developments in the security environment. How we deal with our
international allies and partners also should change. [For many years,
the term "security cooperation" referred to efforts by the]{.underline}
Department of Defense [(DOD) to promote U.S. security]{.underline}
interests through the interaction with and development of friendly and
allied security capabilities.2 [This definition is
evolving]{.underline}, however, [as illustrated by recent strategic
documents and statements by the President and Secretary of
Defense.]{.underline}3 [The term as used recently includes synchronized
efforts by the whole-of-government to build the security
capacity]{.underline} of U.S. friends and allies, [including the
development of economic and political capabilities]{.underline}. The
most recent strategic guidance calls for increased emphasis on an
interagency and interorganizational approach to building partner
capacity and capability, focused on promoting stability and preventing
conflict before it begins, all within a framework that emphasizes
governance and rule of law. Put another way, recent strategic guidance
advocates a whole-of-government approach as the means for translating
national security objectives into the outcome of increased partner
capacity. This change represents recognition that a wide variety of
skill sets is necessary to address these changes in the security
environment. Unfortunately, this change presents challenges for current
security cooperation practices.

The current structure of security cooperation, that is, the
infrastructure of government agencies that participate in security
cooperation activities, does not readily support this new guidance. The
current security cooperation organization originated in the aftermath of
World War II, and continued to evolve through the Cold War. Although the
Department of State ([DOS) has responsibility for planning and executing
security cooperation]{.underline}, the system primarily addresses the
military component of security in terms of equipment and training. The
DOD, under the auspices of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) executes these portions of U.S. Security cooperation endeavors,
which constitute the preponderance of efforts, both in terms of labor
and fund allocation. Furthermore, the DOD's share has grown considerably
in the past five years as Congress significantly increased funding
authorities in order to facilitate stabilization in Iraq and
Afghanistan.4 **[The key issue]{.underline}**, then, [is how to shift
the emphasis from the Department of Defense to efforts shared among
Defense, State, USAID, and other agencies]{.underline} as needed.

#### State [controls]{.underline} security cooperation -- all DOD SC is carried out through embassies under [direct]{.underline} supervision of State

assistance**

[Who Conducts Security Cooperation]{.underline} The following paragraphs
describe the key participants and stakeholders for planning and managing
SC activities at both the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.
Strategic / National Level The National Security Council (NSC) generally
provides the initial guidance and translation of national-level
decisions pertaining to FID, SA, and SC. The Department of
[State]{.underline} (DoS) [is]{.underline} generally [the
lead]{.underline} government [agency for U.S. international
affairs]{.underline}. The Secretary of State advises the President in
forming foreign policy, including the national FID effort. The DoS
assists the NSC in building national FID related policies and
priorities, and is the lead government agency to carry out these
policies. [The DoS Policy Planning Staff, Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs]{.underline} ([PM)]{.underline}, and the new Bureau of Conflict
and Stabilization Operations (CSO) [are the most involved with
interagency planning for]{.underline} FID, [SA, and SC.]{.underline} The
Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security is
the principal advisor and focal point for SA matters within DoS; control
and coordination of SA extends from this office to the Assistant
Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. At the national
level, the PM is the principal channel of liaison between DoS and DoD.
Generally, [DoS directs the overall U.S. Government]{.underline} (USG)
[SA program and DoD executes via SC programs and
activities]{.underline}.

DoD Directive 5132.03, Policy and Responsibilities Relating to Security
Cooperation, dated October 24, 2008, establishes DoD policy and assigns
responsibilities under the GEF, which provides SC guidance to the GCCs,
and titles 10 and 22 of the United States Code (USC), and statutory
authorities, executive orders, and policies relating to the
administration of SC, including SA programs authorized by the FAA and
AECA, as amended. The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy USD(P)
serves as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of
Defense on all SC matters. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Global
Security Affairs) establishes SA policy and supervises SA programs
through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The Secretaries
of the Military Departments (MILDEPs) coordinate on SC policy guidance,
campaign plans, and allocate resources to achieve SC objectives. The
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) provides implementation
guidance for U.S. military plans and programs and provides the Secretary
of Defense with military advice concerning SC.15 Operational and
Tactical Level The Director, DSCA, under the authority, direction, and
control of the USD(P), directs, administers, and provides DoD-wide
guidance to the DoD Components and DoD representatives to U.S. missions,
for the execution of DoD SC programs for which DSCA has responsibility.
Other security SC programs are managed by other Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the GCCs, or MILDEPs. Specifically, GCCs develop
campaign plans to conduct SC programs and activities in accordance with
the GEF, and complete campaign plan and campaign support plan
assessments.16

[The U.S. diplomatic mission to a host nation includes representatives
of all U.S. departments and agencies physically present in a
country]{.underline}. [The President gives the Chief of
Mission]{.underline} (COM), normally **[an ambassador]{.underline}**,
[full responsibility for the direction, coordination, and supervision of
**all** USG executive branch employees in country]{.underline}. The COM
has authority over all USG executive branch employees within the mission
and host country except for employees under the command of a U.S.
military commander (Title 22, USC, Section 3927).17 [The Senior Defense
Official]{.underline} (SDO) or Defense Attaché (DATT) [is the principal
DoD official in a U.S. embassy]{.underline}, as designated by the
Secretary of Defense. The SDO or DATT is the COM's principal military
advisor on defense and national security issues, the senior
diplomatically accredited DoD military officer assigned to a diplomatic
mission, and the single point of contact for all DoD matters involving
the embassy or DoD elements assigned to or working from the embassy. In
addition to being the diplomatically accredited DATT, [the SDO is the
chief of the Security Cooperation Organization]{.underline} (SCO)
[within the Country Team. The SCO includes all DoD elements located in a
foreign country with assigned responsibilities for carrying out SA and
SC management functions]{.underline} under titles 22 and 10 USC. SCOs
typically include military assistance advisory groups, military missions
and groups, offices of defense and military cooperation, liaison groups,
and defense attaché personnel designated to perform security
assistance/cooperation functions.18

#### Substantial security cooperation is funded and controlled by State

Lieutenant Colonel Toney **Filostrat and** Lieutenant Colonel Elizabeth
A. **Medina,** United States Army, **12** -- paper written for the

Assistance in a Period of Constrained Resources"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA568436.pdf> **SC = Security
Cooperation. SA = Security Assistance. FID = Foreign Internal Defense
assistance**

[Significant portions of U.S. military security cooperation are funded
as foreign assistance activities managed by the Department of
State]{.underline}, and appropriated by Congress. With the amount of
funding in the Defense appropriations bills, [it's not common knowledge
that these military programs are funded under DoS budget
authorities]{.underline}. The State Department has always taken its lead
role on foreign assistance seriously, as a significant foreign policy
tool. Over the past ten years, DoS focused on substantial internal
reforms including foreign assistance planning and implementation. The
U.S. government struggles to prepare for a future of persistent conflict
and budget constraints. It is important to solidify reforms and
institutionalize the integrating actions planned in the Quadrennial
Diplomacy and Development Review and the 3D Planning Framework to
implement effective and efficient foreign assistance activities.

### AFF\-\--DOS CP\-\--No Solvency\-\--DOD vs DOS

#### The Department of State is structurally inept and incapable at effective diplomacy

**Zeya** and Finer **20**, \*American diplomat who has served as the
Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human
Rights in the Biden Administration since July 2021, \*\*American
journalist and diplomat who serves as Deputy National Security Advisor
under National Security Advisor (Uzra and Jon, "Revitalizing the State
Department and American Diplomacy," *Council Special Report* No. 89)//BB

It has become an article of faith among policymakers that principled
American leadership has waned but remains in demand around the world.
Moreover, America's network of international relationships is its
foremost strategic asset, even as the agency charged with advancing U.S.
interests through diplomacy---[the Department of State]{.underline}
(DOS)--- [has fallen into a deep and sustained period of
crisis]{.underline}. However, there is a third framing assumption: that
the current crisis offers an opportunity to address this predicament and
revitalize American diplomacy. Despite the decades-long failure to
implement essential reforms---and even in the face of sustained
hostility from the current administration---diplomacy remains the best
tool the United States has to advance its foreign policy interests. [The
role of the State Department has received heightened attention amid the
onslaught it has suffered under]{.underline} the Donald J.
[Trump]{.underline} administration, [which has treated American
diplomats and diplomacy with a mix of neglect and disdain. But many of
the challenges facing the DOS have existed for **decades**]{.underline}.
[Deficits in diversity, institutional culture, and professionalization
are **endemic** to the State Department as an institution, and a
diminished policy role for career officials persisted under previous
administrations]{.underline}. Too often, leaders from both major parties
have taken public support for U.S. leadership in the world for granted
without making a strong enough case to the American public for why it is
essential. Concrete steps can, and should, be taken solely through
executive action in the first year of an administration committed to
revitalizing American diplomacy, with thought to cementing change
through legislation. [The most pressing challenges facing the State
Department include a twenty-first-century policy environment that has,
in some priority areas, evolved beyond the core competencies of most
Foreign and Civil Service officers and an institution **hollowed out**
by three years of **talent flight**, **mired** in excessively layered
structure, and **resistant to reform**]{.underline}. Perhaps most
important, [they include the multigenerational challenge of a diplomatic
workforce that falls woefully short of reflecting the diverse country it
serves, particularly at the senior-most ranks, compromising its
effectiveness and fostering a homogeneous and risk-averse culture that
drives out rather than cultivates fresh perspectives]{.underline}. [The
State Department today risks losing the "war for talent," not only to
the private sector but increasingly to other government agencies, due to
inflexible career tracks, self-defeating hiring constraints, and a lack
of commitment to training and professional development]{.underline}.
Finally, [DOS is **hampered** by Congress's failure over many years to
pass authorizing legislation, leading to budgetary pressures and
diminishing DOS's status in the hierarchy of national security agencies
rather than reinforcing the nation's paramount foreign policy
institution]{.underline}.

#### The military doesn't suffer from the same resource shortages that the State Department does

Background, Major Issues, and Options for Congress," Congressional
Research Service, <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA493001.pdf>)//BB

[In addition to its regional advantage, DOD enjoys two other advantages:
**greater planning and execution capabilities**, and substantially
**greater budgetary resources**. DOD can muster more \[hu\]manpower than
any other agency]{.underline}. [While U.S. military personnel may be
stretched in wartime, there still exist substantial reserves of
personnel that can be tapped to plan and carry out activities. The
combatant commands enjoy considerably more personnel than do individual
embassies, and their personnel are oriented toward planning activities,
whereas State Department personnel are oriented toward collecting
information and furthering U.S. policy through diplomacy, such as
person-to-person contact]{.underline}. Despite waging a war in Iraq,
CENTCOM created a new Joint Task Force in the Horn of Africa (CJT-HOA)
of roughly 2,000 U.S. military personnel (the number fluctuates
regularly) to plan and carry out efforts in the Horn of Africa that
include much foreign assistance activity. In Iraq, DOD temporarily
provided military personnel to fill about 100 State Department PRT
posts, until the State Department could contract persons with the needed
expertise to fill them.

#### Military-to-military contacts are necessary to build trust and avoid miscalculation

Academy, and holds master's degrees in Military Studies, from the U.S.
Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and Strategic Studies, from the

great power competition," Brookings Institute,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/02/12/the-use-of-military-diplomacy-in-great-power-competition/)//BB>

[Within the main elements of national power]{.underline} (diplomacy,
informational, military, and economic, or DIME), [the military is often
considered the last resort. However, the U.S. military has been a **key
player** in, for instance, the **spread of democracy, building partner
countries' strength through military-to-military
relationships**]{.underline} (including in the form of bi- and
trilateral exercises to support standing Operation Plans, NATO, the
United Nations, and Theater Security Cooperation), [personnel exchange,
and humanitarian assistance operations. Through these efforts, among
others, the U.S. military helps to carry out the diplomatic mission of
the United States]{.underline} ([military diplomacy paved the way for
NATO]{.underline}, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization,
[for instance]{.underline}). [When military units participate in
bilateral or multilateral exercises]{.underline} with other countries,
for example, [the purpose is several-fold: The interaction **increases
interoperability** between the militaries, provides for **cultural
exchange and understanding**, and offers an opportunity to expand each
nation's capabilities while exercising potential contingencies. The
importance of military diplomacy in foreign engagement is to **build
dialogue** that may facilitate **further communication and, during a
crisis, avoid confusion between cultures**]{.underline}.

#### The DoD is best for improving strong relationships with host countries

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[Our relationships provide us with a reservoir of strength. They allow
us to operate by, with, and through our allies and partners to meet
shared security challenges]{.underline}. The degree of partnership
should not be measured by the quantity of security cooperation programs,
but rather by their quality. [The Department of Defense has learned from
large-scale assistance programs that for lasting impact, a comprehensive
engagement plan involves more than training and equipping. Importantly,
we are building a culture of **learning and adaptation**, drawing on
lessons from program successes, as well as, from programs that did not
have the desired impact. We are building a learning agenda and
integrating it into decision processes, and measure program impact in a
way that assesses real change, rather than counting our own inputs into
programs as successes in themselves]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} seek
to [learn]{.underline} lessons and avoid the fallacy of sunk costs [by
ruthlessly prioritizing programs that are strategic, and setting
appropriate expectations for programs that provide more of a tactical
advantage. Through this approach, we can unlock the **comparative
advantages our allies and partners** bring as we **collectively work**
together to meet our shared objectives]{.underline}.

#### Military diplomacy builds trust and relations

<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/02/12/the-use-of-military-diplomacy-in-great-power-competition/>)//BB

Moreover, [in places where the U.S. military has maintained a long-term
presence]{.underline} (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Germany), [we see that
military interoperability enhances regions economically---directly
through commercial contracting and the resulting employment,
servicemember contributions through commerce, and in some cases,
contributions of military gear and equipment through foreign military
sales or otherwise]{.underline}. [The resulting "military diplomacy,"
also referred to as "defense diplomacy," "**soft power**," "military
public diplomacy," and "strategic communication," allows the military to
have a **direct impact** on foreign policy through other means. Although
not diplomacy in the traditional sense of a State Department mission,
**military relationships between countries build**]{.underline} a
foundation on which [**further connections** between
nations]{.underline} are developed.

#### State Department assistance fails

Program at The Heritage Foundation ("Don't Shift Security Cooperation to
State Department," *The Heritage Foundation*,

[America spends billions each year on security cooperation and
assistance programs, but the results do not match the
investment]{.underline}. To help improve efficiencies, [the Center for
American Progress recently proposed consolidating **all** these programs
within the State Department]{.underline}. [**That would be a big
mistake**, because it would minimize the Pentagon's role in shaping and
directing security assistance and, ultimately, the program's military
objectives would be subordinated to State Department
interests]{.underline}, such as judicial reform and humanitarian
programs. Those are not the values by which such security assistance
programs should be solely judged. [Security sector assistance programs
deliver arms, military training, and other defense-related services to
allies and partner nation governments]{.underline} via grants, loans,
credit, cash sales, or leasing. [By definition, these programs
**should** prioritize national security. To this end, reforms should
enhance joint State and Defense authorities so programs are evaluated in
terms of America's national strategic goals]{.underline}.

#### Even Bergmann admits structural reforms in the DoS would be necessary for solvency

**1NC Bergmann** and Schmitt **21**, \*senior fellow at the Center for

policy. From 2011 to 2017, he served in the U.S. Department of State in
a number of different positions, including as a member of the secretary
of state's policy planning staff, where he focused on political-military
affairs and nonproliferation; special assistant to the undersecretary
for arms control and international security; speechwriter to
then-Secretary of State John Kerry; and senior adviser to the assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs. Prior to serving in
the State Department, he worked at CAP as a military and
nonproliferation policy analyst and at the National Security Network as
the deputy policy director. Bergmann received his master's degree from
the London School of Economics in comparative politics and his
bachelor's degree from Bates College, \*\*senior policy analyst on the

(Max and Alexandra, "A Plan To Reform U.S. Security Assistance," *Center

https://www.americanprogress.org/article/plan-reform-u-s-security-assistance/)//BB

Moreover, [due to **personnel and resource shortages**, former U.S.
officials found that the State Department is "**not equipped** to
coordinate across the increasingly complex and unwieldy" security
assistance system]{.underline}.80 [Senior policymakers, who often lack
adequate staff or extensive training on security assistance, are not
well equipped to effectively guide the bureaucracy on who should receive
security assistance and how it fits into broader foreign policy
decision-making]{.underline}.81 The State Department's lack of resources
also naturally hampers dual-key provisions that seek to fix coordination
gaps between the State Department and the DOD. This leads to a system
where security assistance policy varies country by country, depending on
the personnel in place and the agency that takes charge. [The added
bureaucracy can make efficient, cost-conscious decisions impossible, and
it opens the process up to political influence]{.underline}.
