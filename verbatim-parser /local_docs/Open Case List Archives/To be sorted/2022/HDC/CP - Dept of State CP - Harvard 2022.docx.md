#### Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its [security assistance]{.underline} with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the area of cybersecurity, by defining proportional response and increasing interoperability.

#### 

#### The counterplan [competes]{.underline}. The plan's "security cooperation" requires the Department of Defense. The counterplan's "security assistance" is administered by the Department of State. 

**Kerr 18**, Visiting Research Fellow at the National Defense University
(NDU) in the Center for Complex Operations (Alexandra, "Defense
Institution Building in the U.S. Context," *Connections*, 17.3)//BB

Finally, [in the U.S. government, "security cooperation" and "security
assistance"]{.underline}---[which]{.underline} [are the chief lines of
effort in the U.S. toolkit to help partners bolster their security and
work with the **U**nited **S**tates to support common security
objectives]{.underline}---[are]{.underline} overlapping but
**[not]{.underline}** necessarily **[interchangeable]{.underline}**.
[**The distinction between "security cooperation" and "security
assistance" activities has to do with the agency administering the
program**: in simplest terms, it is **either** an activity of the
**D**epartment **o**f **D**efense (security cooperation) or the
**D**epartment **o**f **S**tate (security assistance)]{.underline}.
[DOD]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the Department of State
([DOS]{.underline}) [have shared responsibility for engaging with
foreign partner militaries]{.underline} since the mid-twentieth century,
[with]{.underline} the bulk of congressional **[security assistance
funding]{.underline}** [allocated to DOS]{.underline}. [Any security
assistance administered by DOD]{.underline}---whether funded under Title
10 (Armed Services) or Title 22 (Foreign Affairs) of the U.S. Code---[is
a "**security cooperation**" activity]{.underline}.\[21\] After the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the legal framework for the
funding and administration of such activities evolved in response to
emerging threats. Congress increasingly granted funding and authorities
directly to DOD under Title 10 for security cooperation.\[22\]
Therefore, while DOS security assistance programs can include DIB
components, the majority of DIB-specific programming is currently funded
under and implemented by the Department of Defense and is thus
considered security cooperation.

[U.S. security assistance is broken and in need of an
overhaul]{.underline}. Over the past two decades, the bureaucratic
system developed to deliver billions of dollars of military aid to
partner nations has evolved and expanded not by design but as the result
of a series of ad hoc legislative and policy changes. [Though the U.S.
Department of State was initially in charge]{.underline} of security
assistance policy and accounts, [since 9/11, the]{.underline} U.S.
Department of Defense ([**[DOD]{.underline}**) [has established a
separate]{.underline}]{.mark}, well-funded security [[assistance
bureaucracy]{.mark} at the Pentagon. [This]{.mark} [has inhibited
effective]{.mark} congressional [oversight]{.mark}, [harmed
coordination]{.mark} between diplomacy and defense, [and contributed
to]{.mark} the growing [militarization]{.mark} [of U.S. foreign
policy]{.mark}. [It has created a **dysfunctional**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and bifurcated [security assistance [system]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Under
the current security assistance system, the returns on America's
security investments are **limited**, **inconsistent**, and **not**
**strategic**. The consequences of today's broken system include
increased reliance on the military to solve foreign policy challenges; a
perpetuated status quo]{.underline} whereby nondemocratic partners
receive U.S. assistance and where human rights abuses are ignored; [and
an **ineffective and unwieldy** bureaucracy]{.underline}. This matters
because the United States depends on capable allies and partners as a
core component of its national security strategy, but the current system
is not suited to the task. [A new administration can change this by
embracing]{.underline} wholesale [reform]{.underline} of the security
assistance system. To do so, however, a
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}-Harris administration
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} move quickly to work with Congress and
include such reforms in any effort to [[**rebuild and revive** U.S.
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This will require]{.underline}]{.mark}
talking not only about [**[security assistance]{.underline}**
**[authorities]{.underline}**]{.mark}, but fundamentally about **[[money
and resources]{.underline}]{.mark}** as well. [[Any reform]{.mark}
efforts intending to bolster the role of the State Department
[must]{.mark} [start by examining how funding is]{.mark}]{.underline}
oriented and [[balanced between]{.underline} the
[departments]{.underline}]{.mark}. This necessitates close cooperation
with the Hill. There must be a dramatic realignment of U.S. security
assistance. This report provides an overview and a systemic critique of
the current bureaucratic structure of U.S. security assistance and
outlines how transferring resources and responsibilities for security
assistance back to the State Department will better advance U.S.
interests and address the current geopolitical challenges America
confronts. It calls for reviving the centrality of diplomacy by
restoring the State Department's role, as originally intended under U.S.
law, as the overseer of all U.S. foreign assistance. It also offers
recommendations for expanding and training the security assistance
workforce, improving interagency coordination, elevating human rights
concerns in security assistance policy, and adapting best practices from
the DOD. Specifically, this report calls for transferring the following
programs and funding from the DOD to the State Department: The
relatively newly created Section 333 train and equip authority, which
replicates the State Department's Foreign Military Financing (FMF)
authority The DOD's security assistance authorities that focus on
long-term security force reform to the State Department, including the
Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria (ISIS) Train and Equip Fund, and the Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative fund This would result in a roughly \$7 billion transfer,
significantly augmenting the State Department's budget and capacity to
guide security assistance policy. [Putting the State Department back in
charge]{.underline} of security assistance [will]{.underline} be a major
reform and will [require]{.underline} significant operational changes
within the department, as well as [a dramatic expansion of its
administrative capacity]{.underline}. This will take time to implement
and require significant reform within the agency. [The DOD has done an
admirable job]{.underline} in setting up a new institutional structure,
in implementing assistance, and in coordinating with the State
Department. [However, officials across the U.S. foreign policy world
acknowledge that the system is **not working**]{.underline}. Tommy Ross,
a former [[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark} official in charge of overseeing the
Pentagon's security assistance, recently argued that U.S. [[security
assistance is "**not** fit for purpose" and is "**out of sync** with
U.S. priorities]{.underline}]{.mark} when it comes to where resources
are needed most [and]{.underline} the types of [capabilities required by
America's allied and partners."]{.underline}1 Indeed, throughout much of
the last decade, [it has been DOD officials who publicly argued for
increased funding for the State Department]{.underline}.2 Ultimately,
[the current]{.underline} bifurcated security assistance [system is
suboptimal and results in the bureaucratic diminishment of the State
Department relative to the]{.underline} military considerations of the
[DOD]{.underline}. [[Transferring]{.underline}]{.mark} resources and
[[responsibility to the **State** Department would centralize
responsibility for foreign aid under diplomatic
control]{.underline}]{.mark}, while improving interagency cooperation,
as DOD would remain the primary implementer of U.S. assistance. Some of
these ideas will likely be met with innate skepticism from a generation
of security professionals whose experience in Washington has been
characterized by an ever-withering State Department and an
ever-strengthening Pentagon. This report anticipates and rebuts likely
arguments against reform, including the capacity of the State Department
to take on this responsibility, the benefits of the Pentagon's current
management, or the unnecessary disruption that would result from
significant bureaucratic change laid out in this proposal. [[Failing to
reform security assistance not only leaves the United States with a
**wasteful and inefficient** status quo, it also perpetuates the
**marginalization of diplomacy** and locks in the **military's newly
found dominance** in driving U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[The current security assistance system]{.underline} evolved to address
the threats posed by the post-9/11 era and [is now outdated and
ill-suited for a new geopolitical environment]{.underline} characterized
by competition. [If the next administration is to revive U.S. diplomacy
and rebuild the State Department, it must empower the agency to
oversee]{.underline} and direct [foreign assistance]{.underline}. The
[Biden]{.underline}-Harris administration [should]{.underline} seize the
opportunity to work with a new Congress to [reform the
system]{.underline} from its first days in office [and **restore an
effective tool** in the U.S. foreign policy arsenal.]{.underline} A new
[[security assistance]{.underline}]{.mark} system, [[centralized and
coordinated within the State Department, would allow the United States
to wield its security assistance **more effectively and
responsibly**]{.mark} in today's competitive geopolitical
environment.]{.underline} Arms transfers, training, and [support
could]{.underline} also [better support U.S. foreign policy
goals]{.underline}, in particular [bolstering democratic partners and
emerging democracies, making them stronger U.S. partners to counter
threats from authoritarian actors]{.underline}. [Empowering the State
Department to]{.underline} oversee and [manage security assistance would
also ensure that aid is used to advance a values-based foreign policy
that **respects and supports human rights**]{.underline}.3 [[It would
also give U.S. **diplomats greater clout and leverage**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[create greater coherence]{.mark}
to]{.underline} the provision of [foreign assistance
overall]{.underline}. [The result would be to strengthen **a key tool in
the U.S. foreign policy toolbox** and increase the **clout and authority
of America's diplomats**, which is badly needed in this new era of
geopolitical competition]{.underline}.

### PERMS\-\--AT PDCP

#### Security Cooperation is administered by the DoD, Security Assistance is DoS

**McLaren 14**, US Air Force Captain (McKay, "Enhancing the Assessment
of the Costs and Benefits of International Pilot Training (IPT) Within
the U.S. Air Force: Is It Worth It?," RAND Dissertations)//BB

[U.S. Code Title 22 provides congressional authority to conduct DoS
Security Assistance programs]{.underline}. The programs are carried out
through two basic laws, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and the
Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA).24 AECA enacted congressional
legislative controls over export of defense articles and services. The
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs
Committee are responsible for foreign assistance and Security Assistance
program authorization legislation. The Senate and House Armed Services
Committees are responsible for defense programs authorization
legislation. [The term **security cooperation** is used within DoD,
whereas the term **security assistance** is used within the
DoS]{.underline}. It is important to note that these congressional
committees play a role only in FMS authorization. Although Congress
maintains legislative control over exports, FMS is a nonappropriated
program, external to the U.S. budget, and the president is charged with
signing off on spending for the program. Through Executive Order 11958,
as amended, the President delegates selected functions in the AECA to
the secretaries of State and Defense. They are required to provide
reports to Congress and obtain specific congressional approval on
certain exports or transfers. [The DoS has responsibilities relating to
**security assistance**, which include managing the export of defense
articles, services, training, and military technology]{.underline}.25
[DoD has responsibilities relating to **security cooperation**, which
include activities to encourage and enable international partners to
work with the United States to achieve strategic
objectives]{.underline}.26 The military departments and other DoD
agencies involved in managing FMS programs are collectively called
implementing agencies (IAs). The Army, Navy, and Air Force usually have
the responsibility of being the IA in the process of FMS.27 The Air
Force agency for all security cooperation programs is the Office of the
Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs
(SAF/IA). The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition has
oversight in the execution by virtue of having responsibility for Air
Force acquisition. SAF/IA is supported by the Air Force Security
Assistance Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for most FMS
and other logistics functions. The Air Force Security Assistance
Training (AFSAT) squadron at Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is in
charge of planning and, with AETC, managing the Air Force international
military training. It is organized under the authority of AETC.

#### Security Cooperation requires the [DoD]{.underline} to be the source of funding

**Fenell 11**, Captain, US Marine Corps, In Partial Fulfillment of the
Requirements for the Degree MASTER OF ARTS in INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, at
the UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO (Nathan, "Security Cooperation Poorly
Defined" December,
<https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1020&context=thes>)//BB

[Security cooperation is]{.underline} a compilation of [financial,
educational, and material resources, that]{.underline} at their
foundation [are supported by the United States]{.underline}, in
particular the **[Department of Defense]{.underline}**, and are used to
support the peaceful development of democracies in foreign countries.
The [**resources provided by the Department of Defense** are available
to foreign countries after the host nation]{.underline} requests the
peaceful assistance of the U.S. military in response to systemic
deficiencies in the bureaucratic management of a nation state or when a
nation state [recognizes that its military limitations prevent it from
properly defending its geographic borders]{.underline}. The host
nation's request for support from the U.S. is typically an effort by the
foreign country to develop its internal capacity to protect its people
and limit internal or external threats. The security cooperation
exercise Baltic Operation, held in Estonia, is an example of a foreign
country using the resources 9 provided by the United States to improve
its national defense capabilities in direct response to a perceived
threat to its sovereign borders. In this scenario Estonia is attempting
to develop its military capabilities and project an image of strength in
an effort to maintain the freedom it earned, from Russia, at the
conclusion of the Singing Revolution in 1992 and prevent a future
Russian incursion across its borders. [In contrast to this appropriate
use and definition of security cooperation]{.underline} as a strategy to
prevent conflict, the [Obama]{.underline} Administration [is using the
term security cooperation]{.underline} as a way [to]{.underline}
[define]{.underline} a national **[exit]{.underline}** strategy from a
two front war, a strategy that at its heart is based on the
reconstruction of a damaged infrastructure. [The false labeling
of]{.underline} reconstruction operations as [security cooperation is
the foci of this thesis project]{.underline}.

#### Given that basically [any]{.underline} activity is included, the [only functional limit]{.underline} on the topic has to come at the [agent-level]{.underline}

**Mazarr 22**, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation.
Previously he worked at the U.S. National War College, where he was
professor and associate dean of academics; as president of the Henry L.
Stimson Center; senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies; senior defense aide on Capitol Hill; and as a
special assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Michael,
"Security Cooperation in a Strategic Competition," RAND,
<https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA650-1.html>)

To pursue this analysis, we first had to define the bounds of what we
would assess. [Official U.S. government definitions of security
cooperation are very **broad**.]{.underline} [One
definition]{.underline} from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
[states that security cooperation comprises all activities undertaken
by]{.underline} the Department of Defense ([DoD) to encourage and enable
international partners to work with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates to achieve strategic objectives. [It includes
**all** DoD interactions with foreign defense and security
establishments,]{.underline} including all DoD-administered Security
Assistance (SA) programs, that build defense and security relationships;
promote specific U.S. security interests, including all international
armaments cooperation activities and SA activities; develop allied and
friendly military capabilities for self-defense and multinational
operations; and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
access to host nations.3 [Such definitions clearly include almost **any
security-related activity** for **any purpose**.]{.underline} To scope
the focus of the study, [we reviewed]{.underline} official state
documents and strategies and the literature on security cooperation to
identify [11 types of activities]{.underline}: 1. [military
aid]{.underline}, which includes funding through the Foreign Military
Financing (FMF) program, the Excess Defense Articles program, and other
grants and loans 2. [arms sales]{.underline} and transfers,4 such as
U.S. arms sales through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct
Commercial Sales (DCS) programs 3. [military
capacity-building]{.underline}, such as U.S. activities under Section
1206 of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and Sections and
2282 and 333 of U.S. Code, Title 10 (the train and equip authority) 4.
[education and training]{.underline}, including international military
education and training (IMET), professional military education (PME),
and regional centers 5. [personnel exchanges]{.underline}, such as U.S.
activities under the Military Personnel Exchange Program and the State
Partnership Program 6[. military exercises]{.underline}, both bilateral
and multilateral and those that involve foreign partners 7.
[access-related agreements]{.underline}, such as status of forces
agreements (SOFAs) and agreements related to base access and
information-sharing 8. [armament-related agreements]{.underline}, such
as those for co-development of systems and for research, development,
test, and evaluation activities 9. [sustainment of donor-nation
equipment]{.underline} by the donor, the partner, or third parties 10.
[institutional capacity--building]{.underline} to strengthen the partner
institutions that support security services 11. [humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief]{.underline} (HA/DR), which offers support for
efforts to relieve suffering. These categories offered a consistent
template for gathering data across our various study components. [A
major challenge was that reliable and consistent data on each of the 11
categories were not available]{.underline} for all the competitors---not
even for the United States. Especially at the unclassified level,
**[there is simply no comprehensive roster of security cooperation
activities]{.underline}** by the United States, and neither China nor
Russia publishes inclusive data sets of its programs. An additional
challenge was that, in some cases, the different countries define the
categories somewhat differently, so we could not develop data on
entirely comparable sets of security cooperation activities.

### PERMS\-\--AT PDB

#### The permutation is two [simultaneous]{.underline} and [overlapping]{.underline} assistance programs. That dooms solvency for [both]{.underline}. Duplication causes [operational and planning]{.underline} conflicts that cause great power [miscalculation]{.underline}

**Bergmann 21**, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress,
where he focuses on European security and U.S.-Russia policy, and
Alexandra Schmitt, senior policy analyst on the National Security and
International Policy team at the Center, 2021 (Max, "It's time to get
the Pentagon out of the business of administering U.S. foreign aid,"
*Washington Post*,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/11/its-time-get-pentagon-out-business-administering-us-foreign-aid/>)//BB

The result today is that the United States has [two distinct security
assistance systems]{.underline} --- [one at the State Department and one
at the Defense Department]{.underline} --- **[doing the same
thing]{.underline}**. That [has created a bureaucratic mess involving
countless planning and operational conflicts]{.underline} --- one that
also makes it impossible for Congress to conduct effective oversight,
since the two departments answer to different committees. Recognizing
the problem, some policymakers in Congress and the Pentagon have
recently implemented a few useful reforms --- but they go only so far.
Today, when combatant commanders show up in the countries they're
assigned to, they frequently have security assistance funding at their
disposal. But State Department officials of similar rank often lack
comparably flexible funding and yet have to deliver tough messages on
other U.S. foreign policy priorities, from human rights to economic
reform, democratization or even climate policy. This [power imbalance is
not lost on foreign partners, and they act accordingly, often **tuning
out the State Department** while cultivating their relations with the
Defense Department]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} current [bifurcated
system is not just wasteful]{.underline} --- [it's also]{.underline}
potentially [dangerous]{.underline}. Policymakers originally expanded
Defense Department assistance in response to the post-9/11 focus on
counterterrorism, when security assistance was often seen as a technical
tool to smooth collaboration with foreign militaries. But [in a new era
of global great power competition, the provision of arms to another
country sends a loud foreign policy signal, one that **can easily lead
to** **miscalc**ulation. Those assistance decisions need to be well
coordinated and calibrated by **diplomats**, **not
generals**]{.underline}.

#### Security Cooperation is [exclusively funded]{.underline} by the Department of Defense, and Security Assistance is [exclusively]{.underline} Department of State funding.

**White 14**, Major, USMC, a Joint Doctrine Development Officer with the
Joint Staff J7 (Taylor, "Security Cooperation How It All Fits" *Joint
Forces Quarterly*,
https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/jfq/jfq-72/jfq-72_106-108_White.pdf?ver=2014-03-13-152407-220)

Department of Defense (DOD) [security cooperation
activities]{.underline} support or are combined with other assistance
programs and often are a part of nation assistance. This
[often]{.underline} occurs in a manner that may [appear
confusing]{.underline} or convoluted to the joint warfighter. This
article portrays how the programs and activities converge. Although the
various [terms]{.underline} and activities in show in the accompanying
figure appear to have simple names and meanings, they in fact [have
**strict definitions** based on funding **and**
authorities]{.underline}. While some of the activities directly support
one another, others have distinct boundaries between their definitions
and functions. The joint community is beginning to address the framework
of security cooperation in a new joint doctrine publication, Joint
Publication (JP) 3-XX, *Security Cooperation*. [It is important to
embark with clear definitions and understanding of the complex
relationship among these terms]{.underline} to facilitate understanding
by the joint force.

[Security cooperation is]{.underline} referred to in both joint
professional military education programs and joint staffs as [a
tool]{.underline} to be [employed by combatant commands.]{.underline}
However, in other settings, it is a set of programs managed by the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Extensive review of joint doctrine
and policy reveals that the definition of *security cooperation* appears
to encompass these areas and more. After expanding our understanding of
security cooperation, other terms such as [*security force assistance,
foreign internal defense,* and **security assistance**]{.underline}
provide additional specificity for the tasks being conducted, yet some
of these actions [fall **outside security cooperation**]{.underline}.
Even though security cooperation spans the range of military operations
and is inclusive of large-scale operations conducted in support of
foreign nations, it is not all-encompassing of security related support
from U.S. agencies other than DOD.

[Nation assistance is support rendered by foreign forces within another
nation's territory]{.underline} based on mutual agreements.1 While this
term is used to describe the comprehensive approach to assisting other
nations, the definition associated with nation assistance has two
limitations: it does not encompass support to regional organizations,
and it is only assistance by foreign forces. [A better, broader term is
*foreign assistance*, which is assistance to foreign nations ranging
from the sale of military equipment to donations of food and medical
supplies]{.underline} to aid survivors of natural and manmade
disasters.2 When examining the current definitions for *foreign
assistance* and *nation assistance*, we find significant overlap:

> *Foreign assistance to foreign nations* \[ranges\] *from the sale of
> military equipment to donations of food and medical supplies to aid
> survivors of natural and man-made disasters. U.S. foreign assistance
> takes three forms: development assistance, humanitarian assistance,
> and security assistance.3*

This term is likely to resonate with the State Department, which has an
Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance and a designated foreign assistance
budget.

*Nation assistance---assistance rendered to a nation by foreign forces
within that nation's territory based on agreements mutually concluded
between nations.4*

The term nation assistance is not often used in policy or strategy. For
example, the current National Security Strategy mentions foreign
assistance three times but does not use the term nation assistance. The
first opportunity to create some clarity is to replace the term nation
assistance with foreign assistance in the upcoming revisions of JP 3-0,
Joint Operations, and JP 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense.

If foreign assistance were to replace nation assistance in joint
doctrine, the definition would include that portion of security
cooperation that falls outside the realm of nation assistance in
figure 1. Foreign assistance then encompasses all of security
cooperation and reduces some of the ambiguity. [Security
cooperation]{.underline} then [focuses **strictly on the DOD
contribution** to foreign assistance and encompasses all DOD
interactions with foreign defense establishments to build]{.underline}
both national and regional [defense relationships]{.underline} that
promote specific U.S. security interests, [develop allied and friendly
military capabilities for self-defense]{.underline} [and multinational
operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
access to host nations]{.underline}.5

Having addressed the larger constructs, it is possible to review and
clarify the relationships between other programs and activities that
occur within them. First is **[security assistance]{.underline}** with a
specific definition in relation to both DOD and State. It [refers to a
group of programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act]{.underline}
of 1961, as amended, [and the Arms Export Control Act]{.underline} of
1976, as amended. [These programs are **funded and authorized by
State**]{.underline} to be administered by DOD through the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency.6 This is the process by which the United
States provides defense articles, military training, and other
defense-related services. [That portion of security assistance **outside
of security cooperation**]{.underline} in figure 1 [reflects **State and
other civilian agency** involvement]{.underline}.

Conclusion

[Moving resources to the State Department to conduct security assistance
would result in more effective aid that is **less likely to be wasted**
or flow to abusive partners. It would also reduce **unnecessary
bureaucracy** from the current system.]{.underline} [This would be an
important step toward **undoing the militarization** of U.S. foreign
policy and would give an **important foreign policy tool back** to
American diplomats]{.underline}. [The new administration should
move]{.underline} quickly to consolidate [security assistance resources
under the State Department]{.underline}, with accompanying reforms to
the bureaucracy and workforce that handles these issues. [Congress
should support this realignment and transfer]{.underline} the necessary
[authorities and resources from the DOD to the **State**
Department]{.underline}.

#### Achieving consensus at NATO requires [diplomatic]{.underline}, not military, efforts

**Burns 21**, Professor of Diplomacy and IR at Harvard (Nicholas, "A
Time for Diplomacy," *Belfer Center*,
<https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/time-diplomacy)//BB>

**[Diplomacy]{.underline}** also **[works best]{.underline}** when
far-sighted leaders take charge of a crisis and point the way ahead.
[Think of]{.underline}: FDR and [Churchill's organization of a massive
global coalition]{.underline} to defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.
Helmut Kohl, Mikhail [Gorbachev]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} George
H.W. [Bush's negotiations to unite Germany in]{.underline} the
[NATO]{.underline} Alliance and to end the Cold War. Nelson
[Mandela]{.underline} who used a four-year diplomatic negotiation to
dismantle and destroy the apartheid regime. Angela [Merkel]{.underline}
who led the world diplomatically in confronting and sanctioning Vladimir
Putin following Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. Diplomacy
and negotiations, of course, do not always succeed. At its worst, if
diplomacy fails, war, lawlessness, and destruction ensue -- Vietnam,
Rwanda, and Iraq in the past. Syria, Tigray, Myanmar, and China's power
grab in the South China Sea in the present. That is one reason why it is
so important to integrate effectively the work of ambassadors and
Generals combined with the unique power of intelligence officers.
Foreign policy making in the U.S. Government is a team sport. It takes
coordination among all the country's actors to succeed. We diplomats
understand that our ability to succeed is often related directly to the
intelligence on which we depend and the military partners with whom we
share power. It has long been understood that diplomacy and defense are
inextricably tied to each other. [When I was U.S. Ambassador to NATO,
the majority of my staff was from the Pentagon]{.underline} -- both the
uniformed military and Defense Department civilians. [We thought hard
about aligning our diplomatic moves with our military
might]{.underline}. When we responded to the 9/11 attacks, we drew on
the resources of both diplomats and warriors. When NATO went into
Afghanistan, we thought of it as a combined military and diplomatic
mission. What has been missing in the U.S. government in recent years is
a strong, energetic, self-confident diplomatic corps. President
[Biden]{.underline} [and]{.underline} Secretary of State Tony [Blinken
have shown they appreciate the need to elevate diplomacy as a
first-order priority for the United States]{.underline}. From their
first days in office, they have emphasized their determination to
strengthen America's diplomatic power in the world. President Biden
chose the State Department as the site of his first foreign policy
speech. Some of his earliest and most notable appointments immediately
strengthened our diplomatic bench behind Secretary Tony Blinken --
Ambassadors Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Wendy Sherman, Victoria Nuland, and
Samantha Power, as well as an impressive and experienced NSC team led by
Jake Sullivan, Jon Finer, Kurt Campbell, Laura Rosenberger, Sumona Guha,
and many others. For President Biden's new emphasis on diplomacy to
succeed, however, the career Foreign Service, in particular, will need
to be strengthened dramatically. It is no secret that the Foreign and
Civil Service are at their lowest points in morale and effectiveness in
the memory of anyone listening today in this Zoom room. I began my
diplomatic career 41 years ago as an intern at our embassy in
Nouakchott, Mauritania in the Sahara Desert. I have witnessed many highs
and lows of American diplomacy since. Frankly, I have been shocked to
see the damage done to the career Foreign Service during the last four
years. The result is disastrously low morale, a lack of budgetary
support, the debilitating departure of some of our most senior career
diplomats, the sidelining of the Service for a time, and the resulting
lack of confidence in its future by a younger generation of diplomats
who will be most critical to its resurrection. President Biden and
Secretary Blinken have a rare opportunity to lead a radical overhaul at
[the State Department]{.underline}. Under their leadership, this [must
remain a first-order priority for the administration]{.underline}. In
November just following the Presidential election, two former American
Ambassadors, Marc Grossman, Marcie Ries, and I released a Harvard
Kennedy School report entitled, "A U.S. Diplomatic Service for the 21st
Century." Our goal was to recommend the fundamental steps necessary to
reform the Foreign Service and to reposition it for success in the
future. Based on conversations with over 200 people inside the U.S.
government and beyond in over 40 workshops during the past pandemic
year, we reported that the Foreign Service "is confronting one of the
most profound crises in its long and proud history." We recommended a
determined, bipartisan effort to revive and restructure it.
Specifically, we called for a new Foreign Service Act by Congress to set
a renewed mission and mandate for the 21st century diplomatic corps. The
last time Congress passed such an Act was in 1980 when the world was a
very different place with very different challenges. than it is now. We
advocated a "relentless focus on diversity" to counteract the woeful
lack of progress in the percentage of African Americans, women, Latinx
Americans, Asian Americans and other minorities in the senior ranks of
American diplomacy. We called for the creation of a new Diplomatic
Reserve Corps and a Mid-Level entry program to ensure the inclusion in
the diplomatic ranks of experienced citizens with specialized skills.
Given the proliferation of political appointee Ambassadors at the State
Department, we also recommended that, by 2025, 90 percent of Ambassadors
should be career appointees, not 70 percent as is the current practice.
We also recommended that 75 percent of the powerful Assistant Secretary
of State positions be held by career officers. During the Trump
Administration, not a single one of these Assistant Secretary positions
was led by a Senate-confirmed career officer. This was the first time in
memory that the Foreign Service had been entirely unrepresented at that
critical leadership level. Finally, we proposed to rename the "Foreign
Service of the United States" the "United States Diplomatic Service." We
believe it signals transformation and reinforces the vital role our
diplomats perform in service to our nation. This new title would begin
with the two words, of course, that are most important -- United States.
A reinforced career diplomatic corps would help President Biden and his
successors from either party to revive American leadership in the world.
President Biden's great insight has been to see our alliances as the
critical asset we have in this long-term battle for global power and the
future of democracy. [The NATO Alliance is fundamental to a long-term
peace in Europe. It has expanded a zone of security]{.underline} to
encompass the great majority of Europeans, East and West. It protects
all of us, particularly smaller countries, from the Russian Bear. [It
will be **largely a diplomatic task** to return the U.S. to **leadership
of the Alliance** and to maintain allied unity in containing Russia
power in the next few days, weeks, months, and years]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--Trust

#### Only [non-military]{.underline} assistance promotes the trust necessary for Security Assistance to succeed

**Stohl 16**, senior associate with the Managing Across Boundaries
Initiative at the Stimson Center (Rachel, "[The Pitfalls of the Pentagon
Taking the Lead on U.S. Security Assistance]{.underline}," World
Politics Review,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/19963/the-pitfalls-of-the-pentagon-taking-the-lead-on-u-s-security-assistance)//BB

[Oversight and transparency over these myriad programs are often
extremely difficult.]{.underline} Numerous government accounts provide
this money, and depending on the program, different congressional
committees maintain oversight. [The stove-piped nature of U.S. military
assistance and the steadfast secrecy that surrounds decisions made for
reasons of "national security" often create an artificial division
between national security interests and foreign policy
ideals]{.underline}. [They also make it nearly impossible
to]{.underline} identify the exact amount of spending, to [evaluate the
effectiveness and impact of various programs, and to avoid duplicating
resources and efforts across different offices and
agencies]{.underline}. This tension between the State Department and the
Pentagon is not new. For decades, there have been contradictions between
advancing U.S. security interest and foreign policy goals, such as the
protection of human rights. Traditionally, the State Department was the
primary decision-maker that determined who received security assistance
and for what purpose. Yet all of that began to change after Sept. 11.
Before 9/11, Congress had already begun authorizing the Pentagon to
support foreign militaries in roles that had long been filled by the
State Department. Starting with anti-drug training in the Western
Hemisphere, the number and size of these programs has steadily grown
since. In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the purpose of "train and equip"
programs was altered to fill an expanding list of priorities to "build
partner capacity," known as BPC. A RAND Corporation study in 2013 found
that of 184 unique authorities that underwrite 165 BPC programs, at
least 70 are managed and can be utilized by the Pentagon to provide
security cooperation. The mandates of these programs are vast, ranging
from counterterrorism to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
After 9/11, the Defense Department created military assistance programs
to supplement traditional State Department ones. But from the outset,
the appropriated funds that support these programs were subject to fewer
restrictions than their State Department counterparts. For example, the
Pentagon's Regional Defense Counterterrorism Fellowship Program was
originally created in 2002 with a mandate that critics claimed served
the same purpose as the State Department's International Military
Education and Training program. The Pentagon program provided nonlethal
counterterrorism training, but lethal training was made available two
years later. Beyond the lack of transparency and oversight, [a larger
and more philosophical concern is that foreign policy has become
militarized]{.underline}. Similarly, in 2006, the Pentagon was
authorized to use \$200 million of its Operation and Maintenance funds
to equip and train foreign militaries for counterterrorism operations.
In creating these parallel training authorities and
[funding]{.underline} them [through the defense budget]{.underline}, the
Pentagon [is]{.underline}, in effect, [able to implement]{.underline}
its [security assistance without applying Foreign Assistance Act
restrictions, which are intended to ensure that human rights and other
foreign policy concerns are taken into consideration when determining
the provision of security assistance]{.underline}. Experts have counted
a tripling of military assistance out of the Pentagon budget from 2008
to 2015. That money comes with greater influence. And although the State
Department can veto some programs, others are outside its authority, and
program planning is not always shared with State Department personnel.
After 9/11, the Pentagon gained a larger role, not just because it had
the money, but because it was believed that it had the experience and
means to react more quickly to changing situations and needs in an
expansive and fast growing war on terror. While many of the countries
receiving Pentagon military assistance are seen as national security
priorities, their behavior often raises foreign policy concerns that
make diplomatic engagement difficult. Providing arms to these countries
also increases the risk that U.S.-origin weapons could be used against
the United States, its soldiers, its allies and/or its interests. In
many cases, [military]{.underline} and security [assistance is provided
to achieve short-term security gains, which may **undermine** long-term
U.S foreign policy interests]{.underline}. These issues are compounded
by the fact that the Pentagon simply has more money and resources to
address these concerns, and it has become easier for it to simply foot
the bill. Pentagon spending on military assistance has totaled at least
\$122 billion since 2001, compared to approximately \$119 billion for
the State Department. The Security Assistance Monitor, a program of the
Center for International Policy that tracks U.S. security assistance to
countries around the world, has documented a tenfold increase in
Pentagon security aid programs since 2001---from \$1 billion in 2001 to
\$10.8 billion in 2015. State Department spending nearly doubled in that
time from \$4.6 billion to \$8.3 billion. However, it is not the dollar
figure that is worth comparing, but rather the meteoric rise of Pentagon
spending, as opposed to a more gradual increase from the State
Department. This increased spending has made some observers
apprehensive. A Congressional Research Service report last May raised
serious concerns about the roles of the State Department and the
Pentagon with regard to security assistance and reconciling foreign
policy objectives with security goals. It highlighted the lack of
reporting requirements for Pentagon programs compared to the State
Department and the resulting lack of oversight and accounting. In
addition, Pentagon programs are not subject to country-by-country public
reporting, making understanding a recipient country's priorities,
activities and funding impossible. At least 66 Pentagon programs do not
allow any specific country information to be made available at all.
Beyond this lack of transparency and oversight, a larger and more
philosophical concern is that foreign policy has become militarized.
Recipient countries and communities have the impression that help only
comes from the U.S. military, which changes the context of assistance
and the relationship with those receiving it. The mission and its
perception differ depending on whether the help comes from the U.S.
military, or instead from the U.S. Embassy, the United States Agency for
International Development or other civil servants from various U.S.
government agencies. Today, [American security assistance has become
unnecessarily military in nature, simply because there are additional
Pentagon]{.underline} funds and [programs]{.underline} that can quickly
move money. At a fundamental level, [when speaking with members of the
U.S. military]{.underline} involved in these types of missions, such as
building schools or bridges in African countries, [they have recognized
that they are simply there to complete their work and to strengthen
military-to-military relationships]{.underline}. [They]{.underline}
often [don't worry about diplomatic aspects or the types of
relationships they are establishing.]{.underline} To be sure, developing
any relationship, particularly in countries with questionable and at
times poor records of democracy and human rights, is important, and
[military relationships may buy]{.underline} the [security]{.underline}
that is desired [in the short term. But in the long term, without
**deeper diplomatic relationships and nonmilitary engagement**, it will
be **impossible** to achieve larger strategic objectives and foster an
**environment of trust**]{.underline}.

[The use of military forces may also impede the advancement of foreign
policy goals]{.underline}. For instance, [the]{.underline} December 2006
[Senate Foreign Relations Committee report]{.underline}, Embassies as
Command Posts in the Anti-Terror Campaign, [viewed the use of DOD
personnel]{.underline} for counterterrorism programs [as an
**obstacle**]{.underline}: "In Latin America, especially, [military and
intelligence efforts are viewed with **suspicion**, making it
**difficult to pursue meaningful cooperation**]{.underline} on a
counterterrorism agenda."64 As pointed out in Appendix F on
counternarcotics cooperation, Mexico has resisted counternarcotics
assistance that would involve the U.S. military. One analyst claims that
"African [publics and governments have already begun to complain that
U.S. engagement is increasingly military]{.underline}."65

63 2006 SFRC Report, op. cit., states that [there is evidence that some
host country nationals question "the increasingly military component of
America's profile overseas]{.underline}. In Uganda, a military civil
affairs team went to the northern part of the country to help local
communities build wells, erect schools and carry out other small
development projects to help mitigate the consequences of a long-running
regional conflict. Local NGOs questioned whether the military was there
to take sides in the conflict." p. 12.

#### Diplomats are [more likely]{.underline} to follow through on commitments 

**Casler 21**, Ph.D. Candidate, Political Science Department, Columbia
University (Don, "Credible To Whom? The Organizational Politics of
Credibility in International Relations," *Mershon Center Working
Papers*,
<https://mershoncenter.osu.edu/sites/default/files/2021-04/Casler_NWR_Draft.pdf>)//BB

Diplomats' conception of credibility derives from their wide range of
duties: translating between the home government and the world; providing
early warning of troubles and opportunities; building and fixing
relationships; and integrating the military, economic, and intelligence
tools of statecraft.53 [Diplomats are socialized to be experts in
communication, relationship management, and negotiation]{.underline} ---
whether [because they are]{.underline} career civil servants [steeped in
the art of diplomacy]{.underline} or because they enter government from
business or law, where such skills also receive special emphasis. As a
result, their self-image is as the first line of defense against
international strife,54 or the process-oriented analyst and reporter who
keeps the home government informed, represents its interests, and
cajoles others into doing what the home government wants. [Securing
others' trust is essential for each of these objectives, making
diplomats highly focused on the personal and behavioral dimensions of
cultivating relationships]{.underline}.55 [This means that diplomats
constantly and keenly observe how the home government is
perceived]{.underline} across a broad range of issues, events, and
commitments, which they see as tightly interconnected. [The wide scope
of diplomats' core mission inculcates a broad definition of national
interests]{.underline} and a capacious understanding of what the home
government's actions can indicate to international audiences.56 Since
their chief objective is to cultivate strong, durable impressions and
relationships that will persist over anticipated future interactions, I
argue that [diplomats conceive of credibility primarily in terms of
national interests and signaling reputation]{.underline} --- [in other
words, as the **willingness to keep commitments** and bear
costs]{.underline}. [Military officers' conception of
credibility]{.underline} stems from their military education, which
[limits the]{.underline} proper [role of military force in foreign
policy]{.underline} to traditional security goals such as protecting
territory, geostrategic positions, and allies.57 This experience
socializes military officials to be experts in managing violence through
specialized training in military operations, tactics, and logistics.58
As a result, their self-image is as the goal-oriented technician, taking
sober stock of a given task's hard capability requirements.59 Because
they are attentive to the nuts and bolts of military interventions as
well as all that can go wrong in war, military officials hold a
pessimistic professional viewpoint that typically demands maximum
capabilities to address any contingency.60 [This manifests in the
military ethic of "conservative realism,]{.underline}" stressing the
possession of ready forces to meet potential challenges and **[opposing
the extension of commitments]{.underline}** or issuance of threats
unless the capacity to follow through exists.61

While [there are times when it is appropriate for the DOD to have the
authority to directly provide assistance to a partner, these programs
**should be exclusive** to when the United States is at war and fighting
side by side with allied or partner forces]{.underline}. [In these
cases, such as in active combat in Iraq or Afghanistan, it may make
sense for the Pentagon to have its own authorities]{.underline} to
assist foreign partners. [But outside these wartime situations, and
especially in light of today's efforts to end the forever wars, the
State Department is **fully able to oversee** and
**manage**]{.underline} the bulk of [U.S. security assistance
programs]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--AT DoS Fails

#### The State Department is [highly capable]{.underline} and should have total control over foreign assistance

'Independent' Foreign Aid Agency," Heritage,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/america-needs-stronger-state-department-not-independent-foreign-aid-agency)//BB>

Just as is the case overseas, where the U.S. ambassador is the
senior-most official in an American embassy, [in Washington the
secretary of state should have **undisputed authority** over decisions
about allocating U.S. foreign assistance]{.underline}. [The State
Department---**highly competent**, **well-equipped**, **appropriately
staffed and resourced**---should include a foreign assistance component.
That is what countries such as Canada, Denmark, and Sweden already have
done]{.underline}.

# AFFIRMATIVE

### AFF\-\--DOS CP\-\--Perm Do Both

#### Military assistance [does not]{.underline} trade off with State Department involvement

**Early 11**, Lt Col, USAF (Billie, "IMPLICATIONS OF THE MILITARIZATION
OF US FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH SECURITY ASSISTANCE," *Air War College*,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1018707.pdf>)//BB

When the three indicators of militarization are applied to DOD's
security assistance efforts, results indicate that [the United States
relies **heavily** on DOD to pursue foreign policy objectives, but **not
at the expense** of State Department responsibilities. DOD uses security
cooperation to build relationships with partner nations and respond to
humanitarian efforts, and uses security assistance as a flexible tool to
build the capacity of foreign military forces so they can respond to
threats in their regions before conditions require a greater US military
response]{.underline}. Whenever possible, [DOD proactively shapes the
global security environment promoting US interests. DOD has the option
to use its new Section 1206 authority to respond to urgent and emerging
threats based on regional command priorities, or to influence
longer-term State Department programs in support of country
requirements]{.underline}. Also, [DOD's considerable force presence and
commander influence can sway security assistance decisions favorably
toward US interests. However, the State Department maintains a **high
degree of direct involvement** and oversight in all security assistance
decisions]{.underline}.

#### Close collaboration is good

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[A key aspect of the success of the security cooperation enterprise is
the **collaboration** among and within the Department, most notably
DoD's close **collaboration** with the State Department ensures that
programs are designed and executed with broader national security
interests in mind]{.underline}. Internal to the Department of Defense,
we recently reorganized -- bringing the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency under the umbrella of Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities in the
Office of the Secretary of the Defense for Policy to facilitate better
collaboration and coordination. Success requires teamwork, and I can
assure you that our entire team is focused on embracing it.

### AFF\-\--DOS CP\-\--Perm Do CP

#### Security cooperation includes the DOS

TIMES" <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA589722.pdf>

How we deal with our adversaries is changing in response to these
developments in the security environment. How we deal with our
international allies and partners also should change. [For many years,
the term "security cooperation" referred to efforts by the]{.underline}
Department of Defense [(DOD) to promote U.S. security]{.underline}
interests through the interaction with and development of friendly and
allied security capabilities.2 [This definition is
evolving]{.underline}, however, [as illustrated by recent strategic
documents and statements by the President and Secretary of
Defense.]{.underline}3 [The term as used recently includes synchronized
efforts by the whole-of-government to build the security
capacity]{.underline} of U.S. friends and allies, [including the
development of economic and political capabilities]{.underline}. The
most recent strategic guidance calls for increased emphasis on an
interagency and interorganizational approach to building partner
capacity and capability, focused on promoting stability and preventing
conflict before it begins, all within a framework that emphasizes
governance and rule of law. Put another way, recent strategic guidance
advocates a whole-of-government approach as the means for translating
national security objectives into the outcome of increased partner
capacity. This change represents recognition that a wide variety of
skill sets is necessary to address these changes in the security
environment. Unfortunately, this change presents challenges for current
security cooperation practices.

The current structure of security cooperation, that is, the
infrastructure of government agencies that participate in security
cooperation activities, does not readily support this new guidance. The
current security cooperation organization originated in the aftermath of
World War II, and continued to evolve through the Cold War. Although the
Department of State ([DOS) has responsibility for planning and executing
security cooperation]{.underline}, the system primarily addresses the
military component of security in terms of equipment and training. The
DOD, under the auspices of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) executes these portions of U.S. Security cooperation endeavors,
which constitute the preponderance of efforts, both in terms of labor
and fund allocation. Furthermore, the DOD's share has grown considerably
in the past five years as Congress significantly increased funding
authorities in order to facilitate stabilization in Iraq and
Afghanistan.4 **[The key issue]{.underline}**, then, [is how to shift
the emphasis from the Department of Defense to efforts shared among
Defense, State, USAID, and other agencies]{.underline} as needed.

[Who Conducts Security Cooperation]{.underline} The following paragraphs
describe the key participants and stakeholders for planning and managing
SC activities at both the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.
Strategic / National Level The National Security Council (NSC) generally
provides the initial guidance and translation of national-level
decisions pertaining to FID, SA, and SC. The Department of
[State]{.underline} (DoS) [is]{.underline} generally [the
lead]{.underline} government [agency for U.S. international
affairs]{.underline}. The Secretary of State advises the President in
forming foreign policy, including the national FID effort. The DoS
assists the NSC in building national FID related policies and
priorities, and is the lead government agency to carry out these
policies. [The DoS Policy Planning Staff, Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs]{.underline} ([PM)]{.underline}, and the new Bureau of Conflict
and Stabilization Operations (CSO) [are the most involved with
interagency planning for]{.underline} FID, [SA, and SC.]{.underline} The
Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security is
the principal advisor and focal point for SA matters within DoS; control
and coordination of SA extends from this office to the Assistant
Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. At the national
level, the PM is the principal channel of liaison between DoS and DoD.
Generally, [DoS directs the overall U.S. Government]{.underline} (USG)
[SA program and DoD executes via SC programs and
activities]{.underline}.

DoD Directive 5132.03, Policy and Responsibilities Relating to Security
Cooperation, dated October 24, 2008, establishes DoD policy and assigns
responsibilities under the GEF, which provides SC guidance to the GCCs,
and titles 10 and 22 of the United States Code (USC), and statutory
authorities, executive orders, and policies relating to the
administration of SC, including SA programs authorized by the FAA and
AECA, as amended. The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy USD(P)
serves as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of
Defense on all SC matters. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Global
Security Affairs) establishes SA policy and supervises SA programs
through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The Secretaries
of the Military Departments (MILDEPs) coordinate on SC policy guidance,
campaign plans, and allocate resources to achieve SC objectives. The
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) provides implementation
guidance for U.S. military plans and programs and provides the Secretary
of Defense with military advice concerning SC.15 Operational and
Tactical Level The Director, DSCA, under the authority, direction, and
control of the USD(P), directs, administers, and provides DoD-wide
guidance to the DoD Components and DoD representatives to U.S. missions,
for the execution of DoD SC programs for which DSCA has responsibility.
Other security SC programs are managed by other Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the GCCs, or MILDEPs. Specifically, GCCs develop
campaign plans to conduct SC programs and activities in accordance with
the GEF, and complete campaign plan and campaign support plan

#### Substantial security cooperation is funded and controlled by State

[Significant portions of U.S. military security cooperation are funded
as foreign assistance activities managed by the Department of
State]{.underline}, and appropriated by Congress. With the amount of
funding in the Defense appropriations bills, [it's not common knowledge
that these military programs are funded under DoS budget
authorities]{.underline}. The State Department has always taken its lead
role on foreign assistance seriously, as a significant foreign policy
tool. Over the past ten years, DoS focused on substantial internal
reforms including foreign assistance planning and implementation. The
U.S. government struggles to prepare for a future of persistent conflict
and budget constraints. It is important to solidify reforms and
institutionalize the integrating actions planned in the Quadrennial
Diplomacy and Development Review and the 3D Planning Framework to
implement effective and efficient foreign assistance activities.

#### The Department of State is structurally inept and incapable at effective diplomacy

**Zeya** and Finer **20**, \*American diplomat who has served as the
Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human
Rights in the Biden Administration since July 2021, \*\*American
journalist and diplomat who serves as Deputy National Security Advisor
under National Security Advisor (Uzra and Jon, "Revitalizing the State
Department and American Diplomacy," *Council Special Report* No. 89)//BB

It has become an article of faith among policymakers that principled
American leadership has waned but remains in demand around the world.
Moreover, America's network of international relationships is its
foremost strategic asset, even as the agency charged with advancing U.S.
interests through diplomacy---[the Department of State]{.underline}
(DOS)--- [has fallen into a deep and sustained period of
crisis]{.underline}. However, there is a third framing assumption: that
the current crisis offers an opportunity to address this predicament and
revitalize American diplomacy. Despite the decades-long failure to
implement essential reforms---and even in the face of sustained
hostility from the current administration---diplomacy remains the best
tool the United States has to advance its foreign policy interests. [The
role of the State Department has received heightened attention amid the
onslaught it has suffered under]{.underline} the Donald J.
[Trump]{.underline} administration, [which has treated American
diplomats and diplomacy with a mix of neglect and disdain. But many of
the challenges facing the DOS have existed for **decades**]{.underline}.
[Deficits in diversity, institutional culture, and professionalization
are **endemic** to the State Department as an institution, and a
diminished policy role for career officials persisted under previous
administrations]{.underline}. Too often, leaders from both major parties
have taken public support for U.S. leadership in the world for granted
without making a strong enough case to the American public for why it is
essential. Concrete steps can, and should, be taken solely through
executive action in the first year of an administration committed to
revitalizing American diplomacy, with thought to cementing change
through legislation. [The most pressing challenges facing the State
Department include a twenty-first-century policy environment that has,
in some priority areas, evolved beyond the core competencies of most
Foreign and Civil Service officers and an institution **hollowed out**
by three years of **talent flight**, **mired** in excessively layered
structure, and **resistant to reform**]{.underline}. Perhaps most
important, [they include the multigenerational challenge of a diplomatic
workforce that falls woefully short of reflecting the diverse country it
serves, particularly at the senior-most ranks, compromising its
effectiveness and fostering a homogeneous and risk-averse culture that
drives out rather than cultivates fresh perspectives]{.underline}. [The
State Department today risks losing the "war for talent," not only to
the private sector but increasingly to other government agencies, due to
inflexible career tracks, self-defeating hiring constraints, and a lack
of commitment to training and professional development]{.underline}.
Finally, [DOS is **hampered** by Congress's failure over many years to
pass authorizing legislation, leading to budgetary pressures and
diminishing DOS's status in the hierarchy of national security agencies
rather than reinforcing the nation's paramount foreign policy
institution]{.underline}.

#### The military doesn't suffer from the same resource shortages that the State Department does

[In addition to its regional advantage, DOD enjoys two other advantages:
**greater planning and execution capabilities**, and substantially
**greater budgetary resources**. DOD can muster more \[hu\]manpower than
any other agency]{.underline}. [While U.S. military personnel may be
stretched in wartime, there still exist substantial reserves of
personnel that can be tapped to plan and carry out activities. The
combatant commands enjoy considerably more personnel than do individual
embassies, and their personnel are oriented toward planning activities,
whereas State Department personnel are oriented toward collecting
information and furthering U.S. policy through diplomacy, such as
person-to-person contact]{.underline}. Despite waging a war in Iraq,
CENTCOM created a new Joint Task Force in the Horn of Africa (CJT-HOA)
of roughly 2,000 U.S. military personnel (the number fluctuates
regularly) to plan and carry out efforts in the Horn of Africa that
include much foreign assistance activity. In Iraq, DOD temporarily
provided military personnel to fill about 100 State Department PRT
posts, until the State Department could contract persons with the needed
expertise to fill them.

[Within the main elements of national power]{.underline} (diplomacy,
informational, military, and economic, or DIME), [the military is often
considered the last resort. However, the U.S. military has been a **key
player** in, for instance, the **spread of democracy, building partner
countries' strength through military-to-military
relationships**]{.underline} (including in the form of bi- and
trilateral exercises to support standing Operation Plans, NATO, the
United Nations, and Theater Security Cooperation), [personnel exchange,
and humanitarian assistance operations. Through these efforts, among
others, the U.S. military helps to carry out the diplomatic mission of
the United States]{.underline} ([military diplomacy paved the way for
NATO]{.underline}, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization,
[for instance]{.underline}). [When military units participate in
bilateral or multilateral exercises]{.underline} with other countries,
for example, [the purpose is several-fold: The interaction **increases
interoperability** between the militaries, provides for **cultural
exchange and understanding**, and offers an opportunity to expand each
nation's capabilities while exercising potential contingencies. The
importance of military diplomacy in foreign engagement is to **build
dialogue** that may facilitate **further communication and, during a
crisis, avoid confusion between cultures**]{.underline}.

#### The DoD is best for improving strong relationships with host countries

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[Our relationships provide us with a reservoir of strength. They allow
us to operate by, with, and through our allies and partners to meet
shared security challenges]{.underline}. The degree of partnership
should not be measured by the quantity of security cooperation programs,
but rather by their quality. [The Department of Defense has learned from
large-scale assistance programs that for lasting impact, a comprehensive
engagement plan involves more than training and equipping. Importantly,
we are building a culture of **learning and adaptation**, drawing on
lessons from program successes, as well as, from programs that did not
have the desired impact. We are building a learning agenda and
integrating it into decision processes, and measure program impact in a
way that assesses real change, rather than counting our own inputs into
programs as successes in themselves]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} seek
to [learn]{.underline} lessons and avoid the fallacy of sunk costs [by
ruthlessly prioritizing programs that are strategic, and setting
appropriate expectations for programs that provide more of a tactical
advantage. Through this approach, we can unlock the **comparative
advantages our allies and partners** bring as we **collectively work**
together to meet our shared objectives]{.underline}.

Moreover, [in places where the U.S. military has maintained a long-term
presence]{.underline} (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Germany), [we see that
military interoperability enhances regions economically---directly
through commercial contracting and the resulting employment,
servicemember contributions through commerce, and in some cases,
contributions of military gear and equipment through foreign military
sales or otherwise]{.underline}. [The resulting "military diplomacy,"
also referred to as "defense diplomacy," "**soft power**," "military
public diplomacy," and "strategic communication," allows the military to
have a **direct impact** on foreign policy through other means. Although
not diplomacy in the traditional sense of a State Department mission,
**military relationships between countries build**]{.underline} a
foundation on which [**further connections** between
nations]{.underline} are developed.

[America spends billions each year on security cooperation and
assistance programs, but the results do not match the
investment]{.underline}. To help improve efficiencies, [the Center for
American Progress recently proposed consolidating **all** these programs
within the State Department]{.underline}. [**That would be a big
mistake**, because it would minimize the Pentagon's role in shaping and
directing security assistance and, ultimately, the program's military
objectives would be subordinated to State Department
interests]{.underline}, such as judicial reform and humanitarian
programs. Those are not the values by which such security assistance
programs should be solely judged. [Security sector assistance programs
deliver arms, military training, and other defense-related services to
allies and partner nation governments]{.underline} via grants, loans,
credit, cash sales, or leasing. [By definition, these programs
**should** prioritize national security. To this end, reforms should
enhance joint State and Defense authorities so programs are evaluated in
terms of America's national strategic goals]{.underline}.

affairs and nonproliferation; special assistant to the undersecretary
for arms control and international security; speechwriter to
then-Secretary of State John Kerry; and senior adviser to the assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs. Prior to serving in
the State Department, he worked at CAP as a military and
nonproliferation policy analyst and at the National Security Network as
the deputy policy director. Bergmann received his master's degree from

bachelor's degree from Bates College, \*\*senior policy analyst on the

Moreover, [due to **personnel and resource shortages**, former U.S.
officials found that the State Department is "**not equipped** to
coordinate across the increasingly complex and unwieldy" security
assistance system]{.underline}.80 [Senior policymakers, who often lack
adequate staff or extensive training on security assistance, are not
well equipped to effectively guide the bureaucracy on who should receive
security assistance and how it fits into broader foreign policy
decision-making]{.underline}.81 The State Department's lack of resources
also naturally hampers dual-key provisions that seek to fix coordination
gaps between the State Department and the DOD. This leads to a system
where security assistance policy varies country by country, depending on
the personnel in place and the agency that takes charge. [The added
bureaucracy can make efficient, cost-conscious decisions impossible, and
it opens the process up to political influence]{.underline}.
