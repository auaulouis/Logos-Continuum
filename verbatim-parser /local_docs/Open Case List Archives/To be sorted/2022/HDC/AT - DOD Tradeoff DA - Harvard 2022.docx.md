### Aff\-\-- DOD DA\-\--Ukraine Thumper + Not Zero-Sum

#### Ukraine thumps the Asia pivot AND it's not zero-sum

'pivot' complicated by Russia's war in Ukraine," AP News,

President Joe [Biden set out to finally complete the "pivot to
Asia,]{.underline}" a long-sought adjustment of U.S. foreign policy to
better reflect the rise of America's most significant military and
economic competitor: China. [But Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine has
made that vexing move **even more complicated**]{.underline}. China's
government has vacillated between full embrace and more measured
responses as Russian President Vladimir Putin prosecutes his war, making
the decisions for Biden far more layered. Biden and China's Xi Jinping
are scheduled to speak by phone on Friday, a conversation that the White
House says will center on "managing the competition between our two
countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine and other issues of
mutual concern." [The Biden administration is left needing to **focus
east and west at the same time**]{.underline}, [balancing]{.underline}
[not simply economic imperatives but military ones as well]{.underline}.
"**[It's difficult. It's expensive]{.underline}**," Kurt Campbell, the
coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs on the White House National
Security Council, said during a recent forum of maintaining a high-level
U.S. focus in two regions. "**[But]{.underline}** it's also essential,
and I believe [we're entering a period where that's what will be
required of the United States]{.underline} and of this generation of
Americans." [Biden has been deeply invested in rallying NATO and Western
allies to respond to Russia]{.underline} with crippling sanctions,
supplying an overmatched Ukraine military with \$2 billion in military
assistance --- including \$800 million in new aid announced Wednesday
--- and addressing a growing humanitarian crisis. Eastern flank NATO
allies, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, have
made clear to the Biden administration that they want the U.S. to
increase its military presence in the region and do more to address the
worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II. More than 3
million Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in recent weeks.
[Though the war in Ukraine has dominated Biden's focus of
late]{.underline}, [White House officials]{.underline} insist they
**[haven't lost sight of China]{.underline}** --- and are watching
intently to see how Xi decides to play his hand.

[With the **world's attention fixed** on]{.underline} the national
security and humanitarian catastrophe in [Ukraine]{.underline} caused by
Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion, [a similar
disaster is brewing in the Pacific]{.underline}. [Taking a page from
Putin's playbook, the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party, or
[CCP]{.underline}, [is methodically assembling combat power to coerce or
conquer the free people of Taiwan]{.underline}. [Preventing that from
happening will require Washington to learn the right lessons
from]{.underline} the disaster in [Ukraine]{.underline}. [Among them is
the need for Washington to **spend less time worrying** about provoking
authoritarian bullies and more time working to defend]{.underline}
threatened [democracies]{.underline} before the invasion starts. This is
especially critical as U.S. forces are much more likely to be directly
involved in a response to coercion against Taiwan. For 25 years, Beijing
has pursued a determined strategy featuring military modernization,
technological advancements, economic infiltration, cyberattacks and
persistent disinformation campaigns. These efforts have focused on
building a world-class military, erasing American military supremacy in
the seas and skies around Taiwan, and preparing for a potential attack
designed to establish CCP dominion over Taiwan. Meanwhile, **[the United
States has been distracted]{.underline}** elsewhere, **[unable to focus
its strategic and fiscal efforts on the rising power in
China]{.underline}**. [This has been compounded by consistent
congressional failures to provide the Pentagon with the timely,
sufficient and predictable funding necessary to modernize U.S. forces
and maintain sufficient readiness and capacity]{.underline}. Indeed,
[the Department of Defense has received on-time funding only once in the
last 13 fiscal years]{.underline}. Exacerbating these dynamics,
[Washington has been slow in addressing serious concerns and specific
requests for resources identified by Indo-Pacific Command]{.underline}
in successive reports to Congress. Just last year, the command again
warned that [the military balance of power in the region continues to
become "**more** **unfavorable**" for America and its
allies]{.underline}.

#### Security Cooperation with Ukraine is high now

Cooperation with Ukraine,"
<https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine/)//BB>

[The United States, our allies]{.underline}, and our partners worldwide
[are united in support of Ukraine]{.underline} in response to Russia's
premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war against Ukraine. We have
not forgotten Russia's earlier aggression in eastern Ukraine and
occupation following its unlawful seizure of Crimea in 2014. The United
States reaffirms its unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and
territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders,
extending to its territorial waters. Ukraine is a key regional strategic
partner that has undertaken significant efforts to modernize its
military and increase its interoperability with NATO. It remains an
urgent security assistance priority to provide Ukraine the equipment it
needs to defend itself against Russia's war against Ukraine. [Since
January 2021, the United States has invested more than \$4.5 billion in
security assistance]{.underline} to demonstrate our enduring and
steadfast commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
[This includes more than \$3.8 billion since Russia's launched
its]{.underline} premeditated, unprovoked, and brutal [war against
Ukraine]{.underline} on February 24. Since 2014, the United States has
provided more than \$6.5 billion in security assistance for training and
equipment to help Ukraine preserve its territorial integrity, secure its
borders, and improve interoperability with NATO. [United States security
assistance committed to Ukraine includes]{.underline}: Over 1,400
Stinger [anti-aircraft systems]{.underline}; Over 5,500 Javelin
[anti-armor systems]{.underline}; Over 14,000 [other anti-armor
systems]{.underline}; Over 700 [Switchblade]{.underline} Tactical

#### The US [can]{.underline} focus on both regions at once

**Kroenig 22**, deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft
Center for Strategy and Security and a professor in the Department of
Government and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown University (Matthew, "Washington Must Prepare for War With
Both Russia and China," *Foreign Policy*,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/18/us-russia-china-war-nato-quadrilateral-security-dialogue/)//BB>

As Russia threatens the largest land invasion in Europe since World War
II, the most consequential strategic question of the 21st century is
becoming clear: [How can the United States]{.underline}
[manage]{.underline} two revisionist, autocratic, nuclear-armed great
powers ([Russia and China]{.underline}) [simultaneously?]{.underline}
[The answer, according to many]{.underline} politicians and [defense
experts, is that Washington must moderate its response to Russia in
Europe to focus on]{.underline} the greater threat posed by
[China]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific. **[This would be a
mistake]{.underline}**. **[The United States]{.underline}** remains the
world's leading power with global interests, and it **[cannot afford to
choose between Europe and the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. Instead,
[Washington]{.underline} and its allies [should develop a defense
strategy capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating Russia and
China at the same time]{.underline}. In recent weeks, Biden has sent
several thousand U.S. troops to reinforce NATO's eastern flank---and for
good reason. A major war in Ukraine could spill across international
boundaries and threaten the seven NATO allies that border Russia,
Belarus, and Ukraine. Moreover, if Russian President Vladimir Putin
succeeds in Ukraine, why would he stop there? Putin has shown a clear
interest in resurrecting the former Russian Empire, and other vulnerable
Eastern European countries---Poland, Romania, or the Baltic
states---might be next. A successful Russian incursion into a NATO
ally's territory could mean the end of the Western alliance and the
credibility of U.S. security commitments globally. The threat posed by
China is also serious. Adm. Philip Davidson, former commander of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, predicted China could invade Taiwan within the
next six years. This is a war the United States might lose. If China
succeeds in taking Taiwan, it would be well on its way to disrupting the
U.S.-led order in Asia, with an eye to doing the same globally.
Moreover, Russia and China are increasingly working together. As this
month's summit between Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping shows,
Moscow and Beijing are forging a closer strategic partnership, including
on military matters. These dictators could coordinate dual attacks on
the U.S. alliance structure or opportunistically seize on the
distraction provided by the other's aggression. In other words, there is
a serious risk of simultaneous major-power wars in both Europe and the
Indo-Pacific. To address this problem, many have proposed answers that
simply will not work. The Biden administration initially hoped to put
relations with Russia on a "stable and predictable" footing to focus on
China, but Putin had other ideas, as the world is now seeing in Ukraine.
Unfortunately, Washington does not get to decide how its adversaries
sequence their aggression. Others have expressed hope that Washington
can peel these powers apart or even align with Russia against China, but
these are not realistic solutions. The misguided view gaining the most
recent acceptance, however, is that Washington should simply choose the
Indo-Pacific over Europe. Politicians and experts argue that the United
States lacks the resources to take on both Russia and China. They point
to China's power and Asia's wealth and argue that Asia should be the
priority. While Washington pivots to Asia, wealthy European countries,
such as Germany, should step up to provide for NATO's defense. Indeed,
the Biden administration's National Defense Strategy, which has been
delayed due to the Ukraine crisis, is expected to focus on China without
offering a clear solution to the two-front-war problem. A good strategy
starts with clear goals---and Washington's objectives are to maintain
peace and stability in both Europe and Asia. [A good
strategy]{.underline}, however, [starts with clear goals, and
Washington's objectives are to maintain peace and stability in **both**
Europe and Asia]{.underline}. U[.S. interests in Europe are too
significant to let them be worked out solely between Putin and the
United States' European allies]{.underline}. Indeed, the European Union,
not Asia, is the United States' largest trade and investment partner,
and this imbalance is much starker when China (which the United States
seeks greater economic decoupling from), is removed from the equation.
Furthermore, China has conducted military exercises in Europe and the
Middle East. Competing with China militarily means competing globally,
not just in Asia. In addition, Xi is gauging U.S. resolve, and a weak
response in Ukraine might make a Chinese move on Taiwan more likely.
Moreover, [**the United States is not France**; it is **not compelled**
to make gut-wrenching strategic choices about its national security due
to constrained resources]{.underline}. In short, publishing [a defense
strategy that can only handle one of the United States' great-power
rivals]{.underline} (which is what is expected from the forthcoming
national defense strategy) [is planning to fail]{.underline}.

### Aff\-\--DOD DA\-\--No Link

#### Plan's funding comes from [O and M]{.underline} or [new appropriation]{.underline}

**Reynolds 19**, et al, Commandant, Defense Institute of Security
Cooperation Studies (Ronald, "**[The Management of Security
Cooperation]{.underline}**,"
http://cebw.org/images/docs/Legislacao_Webinar/Greenbook_39_0.pdf

[Under the authority of Title 10, Chapter 16, and/or the current
National Defense Authorization Act, DoD provides material assistance and
related training to partner nations]{.underline} to develop specific
capabilities and/or capacities. **[This is normally done
using]{.underline}** **[DoD]{.underline}** Operations and Maintenance
(**[O&M]{.underline}**) **[funding]{.underline}**, [but in some
instances Congress appropriates additional funding for DoD to conduct
these programs]{.underline}. Although it is DoD funding, these programs,
and all security cooperation, must be coordinated with DoS. Security
Cooperation practitioners refer to these programs as Building Partner
Capacity (BPC) programs and execute them using a pseudo Letter of Offer
and Acceptance. All BPC programs require congressional notification.
Below are just a few examples. Examples with four digits in quotes
represent temporary authorities whose authorizations can be found in

#### It\'s cheap

et al, "Security Cooperation Organizations in the Country Team: Options

[The United States conducts a wide range of security cooperation
missions and initiatives]{.underline} that can serve as key enablers of
U.S. foreign policy efforts to assist and influence other countries.
[For a **relatively small investment**, security cooperation
programs]{.underline} can [play an important role by shaping the
security environment and laying the groundwork for future stability
operations with allies and partners]{.underline}. Security cooperation,1
in the form of noncombat military-to-military activities, includes
"normal" peacetime activities, such as building the long-term
institutional and operational capabilities and capacity of key partners
and allies, establishing and deepening relationships between the United
States and partner militaries, and securing access to critical areas
overseas. Security cooperation also can include conducting
quasi-operational efforts, such as helping U.S. partners and allies
manage their own internal defense.

### Aff\-\--DOD DA\-\--No China War

#### **No US-China war**

**Lei 20**, PhD and MA in International Politics, associate research
fellow with the China Institute of International Studies. (Cui,
7-24-2020, \"Despite heated talk, risk of a US-China hot war is small\",
*South China Morning Post*,
<https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3094121/why-risk-us-china-hot-war-small-despite-heated-talk>)

[Many]{.underline} observers [are pessimistic about deteriorating
US-China relations and believe the two countries are **heading
towards**]{.underline} a cold **[war]{.underline}**. Even worse, [some
argue that the situation might be **more dangerous** than the US-Soviet
Union Cold War, and that a **hot war might break out** between the two.
This argument is **unconvincing**]{.underline}. **[First]{.underline}**
of all, [**deterrents** to a flare-up are]{.underline} much
**[strong]{.underline}**er [**in US-China relations** than in US-Soviet
relations]{.underline}. Although economic and people-to-people ties
between China and the US are declining, they are still close compared to
US-Soviet ties. [It is **hard to decouple** two **closely intertwined
economies** and **societies**.]{.underline} Take two examples. [China is
expected to become the world\'s **largest consumer market**, a
temptation **hard to resist** for exporters, **including** those from
the US. And in **education**, more than **300,000 Chinese students**
study in the US, bringing in **huge revenues** for the US education
industry]{.underline}. Many universities go to great lengths to woo
international students. Recently Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology even sued the government over its new visa restrictions,
now aborted, on international students. [Second, **even if** there is
decoupling, the pain would **not be too great** and can be **kept out**
of the **national security sphere**]{.underline} if properly handled. In
fact, for national security reasons, a modest degree of isolation will
make both sides more secure and comfortable. For instance, if China's
information technology equipment cannot capture Western markets, the US
will be more relaxed. If China cannot get advanced technologies from the
US and its technological progress slows down, the US will be less
anxious. In the same vein, China feels assured knowing that if the Trump
administration does impose a travel ban on Communist Party members, it
would be abandoning one of the tools available to the US to promote
"peaceful evolution" in China. Economic decoupling is undeniably more
painful for China than for the US. But unlike Japan during WWII, which
was hit hard by the US oil embargo because of its lack of natural
resources, China has no such problems. Given its large domestic market,
losing the US as a major customer is not a disaster for China, and can
be compensated through more dynamic economic activities at home. China
can also make up for being freezed out of technological exchanges by
turning to indigenous innovation. As for the US, it can import goods
from other developing countries, albeit less cheaply. The relative loss
is acceptable when weighed against the heightened perception of economic
independence and security. [Third, the ideological confrontation between
China and the US is **less intense**]{.underline} than that during the
Cold War. Unlike the obsession with ideology in those days, [the line
between capitalism and socialism is **blurred** today. The **market
economy** has become **universally recognised** as the best way to
promote economic growth]{.underline} and, politically, many countries
have embraced democracy. Even North Korea calls itself the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. Although ideological hawks in the US still
long for the day when the beacon of freedom will light up the world,
[after **many years** of fighting **bloody wars overseas**, most
American people are **not interested** in promoting democracy
abroad]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [China just wants to **preserve its
political system** and has **no interest in exporting it** to other
countries, as the Soviet Union did. Thus, ideological **antagonism** in
China-US relations can easily be **eased** by calculations of realistic
**interests**, which create conditions for **compromise and
cooperation**. **Fourth**, both China and the US have **many options
other than war** to achieve their policy goals]{.underline}. While they
have no allies to serve as a buffer, given the nature of the potential
conflict in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, [both countries are
**adept at operating in grey zones** and fighting psychological, public
opinion or diplomatic warfare **below the threshold of
war**]{.underline}. The forced closure of the Chinese consulate in
Houston by the US government is just the latest act of brinkmanship. In
addition, [given China's huge economic and financial interests in the
US, the latter can **wield the stick of sanctions** when use of force is
**highly risky** or not worth it.]{.underline} [When both sides have
**many tools and options,** why would they **rush to war** to achieve
their goals? **Last**]{.underline} but not least, [the **imbalance of
power** will act as a deterrent]{.underline}. Some say the US and Soviet
Union did not fight a hot war because they were evenly matched. It was
not the case, actually. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet
Union was at a relative military disadvantage. Moreover, [a country
needs the **will to fight** before **going to war,** even if it is
stronger militarily than its adversary. Having fought **years of
meaningless wars**, the US is **weary of war**]{.underline}. [China,
too, **abhors war**. Having a **clear understanding** of US strength,
**especially** when its own economy is **slowing down** and it is facing
**various domestic challenges**]{.underline}, [China would **not wish**
to **recklessly start a war with the US**. In summary, the possibility
of a **hot war** between China and the US is **very
small**]{.underline}. The greatest danger for China is not a cold or hot
confrontation with the US, but policymakers' interpretation of the
momentary hostility towards Beijing of a portion of the American
population and the larger world. An erroneous interpretation could end
China's march to further opening up, and see it turn instead towards
self-isolation.

• Opportunity cost #5: Two decades of military conflict have eroded U.S.
military readiness. [While the U.S. military has global
responsibilities, it has finite resources, and nothing drains U.S.
military readiness like an active war]{.underline}, as made clear by the
2017 report of a Task Force on Defense Personnel co-chaired by former
U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and former National Security
Adviser James Jones.39 For the Pentagon, [prosecuting]{.underline} the
[war]{.underline} in Afghanistan [is a top-level priority that
**requires significant time** from its top officials as well as
tremendous resources]{.underline}---[from regular rotations of thousands
of personnel to equipment to budget expenditures]{.underline}. [With
pressing needs to bolster U.S. force posture in Asia and Europe to deter
threats from Russia and China]{.underline} and adapt the military to
emerging threats such as cybersecurity, [the U.S. military will have a
difficult time dedicating the necessary attention and resources to these
threats while **fighting an indefinite war**]{.underline} with roughly
14,000 troops in Afghanistan.
