Finally, [[NATO needs to **maintain ambiguity on what justifies an
Article 5 response**.]{.underline}]{.mark} As mentioned previously,
[ambiguity has served NATO well. [A set threshold for]{.mark} when NATO
will invoke an Article 5 [response to a cyber-attack]{.mark} on a member
country [is **not necessary**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [ambiguity has
historically served the alliance well, [as demonstrated by]{.mark} the
**[9/11]{.mark}** attacks. [If the alliance]{.mark} had [said
weapons]{.mark} were [only include **guns**,]{.mark} bullets,
[**tanks**, and **bombs**, it would]{.mark} have set a threshold
**[preclud]{.mark}**ing a NATO response to attacks that turned four
planes into [**improvised missiles**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The larger
issue of ambiguity is that there is **no set definition** of what
constitutes an **armed attack** and what **circumstances** dictate a
**collective response**, as per Article 5. [Remaining
ambiguous]{.mark}]{.underline} on the severity threshold of a
cyber-attack [[allows the alliance to act in]{.mark} cases of future
cyber-[attacks that cause **severe damage**, but also]{.mark} allow NATO
to **[refrain from over-reacting]{.mark}**, even if an event is a cyber,
or kinetic, attack as per a definition. [It would **be a mistake** to
set a threshold for attacks that cannot]{.mark} currently [**be
anticipated**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Otherwise, attackers would be *[more]{.underline}* impelled to start cyber wars

[NATO maintains a cyber deterrence **policy of
[ambiguity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, [it [does not draw a clear
line for]{.mark} when a cyber attack is **sufficiently
harmful**]{.underline} [to cross the threshold]{.underline} to an armed
attack. Second, [[it does not]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [[have an
**operational definition**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} what the **[[collective
response]{.underline}]{.mark}** would be [if that threshold were to be
crossed. [Such a]{.mark} cyber deterrence [policy **offers several
advantages**. If the Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} were to [[set a
**clear threshold**, the opponent would]{.underline}]{.mark} better
[understand **how to stay below that**]{.underline} threshold. [This
would]{.underline} strengthen deterrence of threats above the threshold
but would [encourage the opponent to [**increase attacks just below the
threshold**.]{.mark}]{.underline} A certain degree of [[ambiguity is
**beneficial** because it could make opponents **wary of going too
far**]{.underline}]{.mark} in their cyber attacks. [The opponent always
fears [**stepping over the invisible line**, and]{.mark}]{.underline}
thus [[prefers to **tread lightly**]{.mark}. A similar]{.underline}
deterrence [posture]{.underline} arguably [worked well during the **Cold
War**.]{.underline}

### Neg---AT: Cyber Aff---Deterrence Working Now---1NC/2NC

#### They have it [backwards]{.underline} -- the prevalence of grey-zone activities [proves]{.underline} deterrence is *[strong]{.underline}* now.

In many ways, [the [**prevalence of gray zone approaches** is actually a
**testament** to the **strength of the**]{.mark} **liberal international
[order]{.mark}** [that America has led]{.mark} since World War
II]{.underline}. [[Gray zone approaches reflect]{.mark} the fact [that
there are **strong**]{.mark} **international [norms]{.mark}** [against
**outright aggression**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[territorial conquest,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [that [even
moderately revisionist powers]{.mark} often **[hesitate to pay the
costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[from moral opprobrium, to economic
penalties, to the **potential for a military
response**]{.underline}---[[associated with]{.mark} flagrantly
[**violating** those norms]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the same vein,
**[[gray zone conflict]{.mark} actually [underscores the fact that
U.S.]{.mark} military power, [alliances,]{.mark} [and security
guarantees]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[the structures that have long
served as the backbone of the international
order]{.underline}---[[**have generally proven quite effective**
in]{.mark} [**deterring** or **punishing**]{.mark} such
[flagrant]{.mark} military [aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed,
[[these strengths]{.mark} of the international system [have
fostered]{.mark} the very [ambiguity and incrementalism]{.mark} [that
characterize gray zone approaches]{.mark}, persuading revisionist
powers]{.underline}---usually---[to take small steps that sow
doubt]{.underline} about what is really happening, [and that avoid more
dramatic provocations that might cross clearly established "red
lines."]{.underline}[[\[11\]]{.underline}](https://www.fpri.org/article/2016/02/paradoxes-gray-zone/#_ftn11)

#### The status quo is [working]{.underline}---there's a [conceptual understanding]{.underline} of what invokes Article 5, while maintaining [effective ambiguity]{.underline}

[[Since]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} world is]{.underline} still **[so
new]{.underline}** [and [continues to **advance**]{.mark} each day
[with]{.mark} new **[tech]{.mark}**nologies, NATO is still trying to
find the best policies and best course]{.underline} of action to take
[in response to the new threats to peace and democracy that
**cyber-attacks** pose on the alliance]{.underline} and this new world.
[NATO welcomes and many **experts** on cyberspace give it
**recommendations** on how to deal with this new threat. The [cyber
world is **too new** for NATO to **bind its
hands**]{.mark}]{.underline}, so to speak[[, with]{.underline}]{.mark}
rigid [[**rules** and **laws** regarding **when**, **how**, and **why**
it would invoke Article 5]{.mark} in the case of a
cyber-attack]{.underline} on a member country. In response, [at the 2014
summit in Wales, the alliance made it clear that a cyber-attack **can**
and **will** invoke an **Article 5** response. It also made it clear
that ambiguity has served the alliance well, and [it refused to
**define** the **kind of attack**]{.mark} that would invoke an Article 5
response.]{.underline}

However, [[that is not to say]{.mark} that [NATO has been
**irresponsible**]{.mark}]{.underline} [or lackadaisical in trying to
give some **understanding** on when a cyber-attack becomes an **armed**
attack. [With]{.mark}]{.underline} the help of [[experts
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the field of [[cyberspace,]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**]{.mark}nternational [[**law**, and
**policymakers**,]{.mark} the [Tallinn Manual was written]{.mark} and
published [to provide]{.mark} **guidance** to NATO and any other
international or national alliance or **government** seeking
it.]{.underline} Although [the Manual offers [guidance on]{.mark} what
[**scale**, **effects**, and]{.mark} attacker **[motivation]{.mark}**
would be severe enough to fall into the category of an armed attack, [it
does not give **specific details**, only a **conceptual idea**]{.mark}
of what an armed attack might look like in]{.underline} the
[cyber]{.underline} realm. Then, [with the guidance of the Manual, and
**i**]{.underline}nternational [**law**, there could be a **better
understanding** of what would then invoke an Article 5
response.]{.underline} Nevertheless, [it is not, and was not intended to
be, a complete go-to-guide for how each member country should conduct
itself in the cyber world.]{.underline}

**The [whole point]{.underline} of hybrid war is that it [doesn't
escalate *by design*.]{.underline} Russia will take actions
[approaching]{.underline} redlines but won't actually trigger them --
solves conflict**

Political Science, Balsillie School of International Affairs, University

57:451-470

The defensibility of NATO's northeastern flank NATO enlargement has
provided a key source of insurance by raising the costs of direct
Russian aggression against alliance members. This is true even in
arguably the weakest part of the alliance, the Baltic littoral region.
Conventional wisdom holds that the defense of this region against
Russian aggression is especially costly for the USA and NATO to
undertake. The countries located there are exceptionally vulnerable.
Whereas most benefciaries of NATO enlargement are at least largely
separated from Russia thanks to Belarus and Ukraine, the Baltic
countries are directly contiguous and have only a short land connection
to continental NATO by way of the Polish--Lithuanian border. According
to this perspective, a rebalancing of alliance commitments in Europe is
necessary because the local military balance favors Russia too much and
the political will to defend the Baltic states is too low. The USA will
never 'trade Toledo for Tallinn' (Shifrinson 2017, 111). Note the
contradiction: According to critics, enlarging NATO simultaneously
provokes Russia and weakens the alliance. But what rational cause would
Russia have to be dismayed when a potentially adversarial military
alliance willingly takes on major liabilities? The alliance security
dilemma---whereby the strengthening of one coalition may inadvertently
create insecurity for another---suggests that Russia would be
justifiably concerned if NATO either incorporated states that
meaningfully aggregate capabilities or increased military ties with such
powerful states (Snyder 1984, 477). By NATO enlargement critics' own
admission, the Baltic countries subtract from, rather than add to, what
the alliance can do. Russian might have reasons to protest enlargement,
but these reasons likely concern the perceived slight to its honor when
former Soviet states became formal defense partners of the USA (Götz
2017, 236--239).4 NATO enlargement has not been responsible for Russian
authoritarianism or international revisionism because it never
threatened Russia. Pessimism regarding the defensibility of NATO's
so-called northeastern flank is also unwarranted. To begin with, much of
the policy literature on this region concentrates on Russia's strengths
while ignoring its key weaknesses. The Baltic countries would almost
surely lose set piece battles against Russia, but deterrence ultimately
hinges less on being victorious in a potential war than on imposing
unacceptable costs on the adversary. The Baltic states have already
begun embracing unconventional strategies intended to boost national
resiliency and make occupation difficult (Collins and Beehner 2019).
Guerrilla tactics and territorial defense serve to augment their denial
capabilities that in turn would complicate Russian efforts to hold
territory and pacify the local population. Moreover, **[[Russia may have
local]{.mark} escalation dominance]{.underline}**[, **[but it
does]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[not have global escalation
dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[given the forces that NATO members
possess]{.underline}**. **[A [large-scale land grab]{.mark} made at the
expense of any of the Baltic countries [might precipitate escalatory
dynamics that it could not control]{.mark}. Nuclear war]{.underline}**
may be a remote possibility, but it **[cannot be discounted
altogether]{.underline}**. **[[One reason why Russia has resorted
to]{.mark} so-called [hybrid tactics]{.mark} against the Baltic
countries]{.underline}**---**[such as political subversion and eforts to
foment unrest]{.underline}**---**[[is that it does not wish to provoke a
reaction]{.mark} that [it cannot handle]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Lanoszka
2016). **[Put simply, [Russia may believe in]{.mark} NATO's [Article
Five]{.mark} collective defense commitment [more than NATO members
themselves do.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Neg---AT: Cyber Aff---Deterrence Turn---2NC

#### Redlines embolden aggression *[more]{.underline}* than clarity [AND]{.underline} jeopardize [NATO's credibility]{.underline}

Z'hra M. **Ghavam 16**---Lieutenant Commander, United States Navy, B.S.,
United States Naval Academy. (\"NATO's Preparedness for Cyberwar,\"
September 2016, <https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/50552>)

[[NATO's]{.mark} publicly declared [policy on cyber threats is
**consciously** and **purposefully
vague**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}207 Why? [**Strategic ambiguity**
has]{.underline} its [benefits.]{.underline} According to the Atlantic
Council panel, [[there **is no "redline**"]{.underline}]{.mark} [or
"determined threshold" [that would **automatically define** a cyber
act]{.mark} as an act of war.]{.underline}208 [[Leaving]{.mark} the
[rules undefined affords NATO **ample room**]{.mark} in which to
operate. For a 28-member multinational organization that operates on the
**principle of consensus**, **time** and **latitude** for solidifying
strategic-level decisions are **critical**. [If NATO **publicized a
cyber redline**, it would **box the Alliance into a corner**.
This]{.mark} kind of policy [could **embolden cyber offenders** and
provoke **massive intrusions** that target]{.mark} NATO's networks at
[**just below this threshold**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Having a
**defined redline** could]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[invite
nefarious]{.mark} cyber [actors to **cross it to test NATO's resolve**,
**damage its reputation as a leader**]{.mark} in Euro-Atlantic
security[, and **undermine the credibility** of]{.mark} its [Article 5
commitments.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Following the Wales Summit in 2014, [NATO affirmed its stance on law and
cyberspace while refusing to address cyber redlines:]{.underline}

[Our policy also recognizes that **i**]{.underline}nternational
[**law**, including]{.underline} international [humanitarian law and the
UN Charter, applies in cyberspace. Cyber attacks can reach a threshold
that threatens national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security, and
stability.]{.underline} Their impact could be as harmful to modern
societies as a conventional attack. [We affirm, therefore, that cyber
defense is part of NATO's core task of collective defense.]{.underline}
A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of
Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case
basis.209

However, an [invocation of Article 5 does not necessarily mean that a
NATO response would include force.]{.underline} Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty states the following:

[The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
and]{.underline} consequently they [agree]{.underline} that,
[if]{.underline} such [an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise
of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by
Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the
Party]{.underline} or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith,
individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it
deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and
maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.210

Thus, [as long as each Alliance member takes "such **action as it deems
necessary**," it cannot be found in violation of the **collective
defense** principle.]{.underline}211 In the case of a major act of
cyberwar against one of its members, [NATO could invoke Article 5 as a
show of solidarity but opt to refrain from employing **kinetic**
military **force**]{.underline}; instead, [the Alliance could use purely
**cybernetic means** or a **hybrid alternative** that combined
cybernetic tools with military force to fulfill its
objectives.]{.underline}

[In all, [NATO's]{.mark} **establishment**, **organization**, and
**employment** of its [sophisticated]{.mark} cyber [response
agencies]{.mark} and IT resources like the **NCIRC**, **NCIO**,
**NCIA**, and **RRT** are **[indicat]{.mark}**ive of [how seriously the
Alliance]{.mark} has [implemented]{.mark} its **[cyber defense]{.mark}**
policies at the operational level. [NATO's]{.mark} cyber
[**policy**,]{.mark} standard operating [**procedures**, and **ambiguous
thresholds**]{.mark} for the use of military force [make the Alliance
**highly prepared** to **respond effectively** to]{.mark} major acts of
[cyber aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} against one or more of its
members. If an act of cyberwar met the threshold of an armed attack,
[NATO would]{.underline} probably [be prepared to manage, counter, and
resolve the issue in cyberspace]{.underline}; still, [one cannot exclude
the possible need to take kinetic measures. Out of a numerical ranking
of 1--3, the Alliance earned a preparedness score of 3 in cyber
strategy.]{.underline}

#### Retaining flexibility is key for appropriate response

[In light of]{.underline} the [recent developments]{.underline} of NATO,
[[it would]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to [[be in NATO's best interest to
**remain ambiguous**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and allow the organization to
approach its response to a cyber-attack on a **case-by-case
basis**.]{.underline} For instance, the [[attacks on Estonia might
require intervention]{.underline}]{.mark} on behalf of the Estonian
[people [due to the fact they are]{.mark} a **[smaller]{.mark}, lesser
defensible** state. Estonia would not be successful standing up against
Russia]{.underline}, and [as Russia becomes more aggressive in the
former-Soviet bloc region]{.underline}, small states like Estonia are at
risk. [If another attack were to occur against Estonia, the attacks
would have to be more severe to invoke an **Article 5**
response]{.underline}. [Such a response would enable NATO states to act
as if they too have been attacked as per the **mutual defense
announcement against cyber-attacks**]{.underline} at the Wales Summit.
[Yet, [if the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is attacked in a similar manner,
there]{.mark} likely **[does not need to be the same]{.mark}** scale of
[defense]{.mark} taken[, because the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has more **resources**]{.mark} and
capabilities]{.underline} to respond on its own. [[Remaining ambiguous
allows NATO to **choose the best opportunities**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[for supporting and defending]{.underline} member states.

[Before it could decide on a response, [NATO would]{.mark} first need to
[consider]{.mark} the **[severity of the attack]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[to determine]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[appropriate]{.underline}]{.mark} level of [[**response**,]{.mark}
whether it be [**sanctions**, cutting off]{.mark} financial
**[aid]{.mark}** to the offending country[, or]{.mark} a **[boots on the
ground]{.mark}** campaign.]{.underline} However, [**[even while
retaining flexibility]{.mark}** in its response to a cyber-attack[, NATO
understands the **importance of cyber defense**. It aims to
deter]{.mark} cyber-attacks against its networks and member country's
networks [through strong]{.mark} cyber
**[defenses]{.mark}**]{.underline}, although NATO has yet to fully seek
what Cold War theorists have called "deterrence by denial," and which
could be an effective mechanism.161 With such a posture, the enemy need
not be convinced that a cyber-attack will be followed by retaliation or
punishment; instead, it is only necessary to convince the enemy that the
initial attack will have no effect.16

#### Ambiguity produces better *[tailored responses]{.underline}* to [re-establish deterrence]{.underline}

Susan **Davis 19**---General Rapporteur for this report, Congresswoman.

[NATO's ambiguity also extends to]{.underline} the type of
**[punishment]{.underline}** [it threatens]{.underline} were it
[to]{.underline} suffer [a cyber attack. The [Alliance]{.mark} has [made
clear]{.mark} that [it neither **limits
punishment**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} similar
[[cyber attacks nor **excludes them**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Instead,
[[it keeps the option]{.mark} open [to use the **full range of Allied
capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **deter** and
**counter**]{.underline}]{.mark} cyber attacks. Once again, [[this
introduces **useful doubt in an opponent's mind**.]{.mark}
A]{.underline} more [technical reason for the difficulty of restricting
retaliation to cyber attacks is that [it is hard to **credibly
threaten**]{.mark} the [assets]{.mark} of the attacker in a similar
fashion. [If an attacker shuts down a power plant, would the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} have cyber options to [[attack]{.mark} an
opponent's power plants or]{.underline} [[**similar infrastructure**?
Would NATO]{.mark} even **[want to if it could]{.mark}**]{.underline},
as it complies with the principle of proportionality and international
law in all its activities[[? NATO's ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark} on
the type of retaliation [[serves a **convincing purpose**. It produces
doubts]{.mark} in the would-be attacker's mind [and presents **more
options** to **tailor** and scale a response to **re-establish
deterrence**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Neg---AT: Cyber Aff---Impact Defense---1NC 

#### No [large-scale]{.underline} Russian cyberattacks

**Baezner 17** (Marie and Patrice Robin; Feb; Cyber Defense Project
(CDP) Center for Security Studies (CSS), ETH Zürich, "Cyber-Conflict
Between the United States of America and Russia"
https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/184547/Cyber-Reports-2017-02.pdf?sequence=1)

On the other hand, [[both]{.mark} states might [not desire]{.mark}
further [escalation]{.mark}, preferring to restrain the conflict to
cyberspace]{.underline}. [Each would follow the "tit-for-tat" logic and
accuse each other]{.underline} **[while [never reaching]{.mark} a
tipping point where the conflict spills over to a [conventional]{.mark}
war]{.underline}**. Such a tipping point would be linked to the
intensity of the attack or the nature of the targets. [Both
[nations]{.mark} would [keep]{.mark} the [cyberattacks **small**]{.mark}
enough not to trigger a bigger reaction. The same would be observed on
the choice of targets, with both avoiding certain critical or sensitive
targets, for instance critical infrastructures.]{.underline} In order to
contain the conflict in cyberspace, both states would have **[[to
demonstrate]{.mark} their [restraint]{.mark} by selecting [options with
low]{.mark} risk of [miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}** (Lin, 2012,
pp. 64--66). In the future, [it might also be possible to [see]{.mark} a
[deescalation in]{.mark} the form of the emergence of an international
treaty or at least further **bilateral [treaties]{.mark}**
[between]{.mark} the [USA and Russia]{.mark} on
cyberattacks]{.underline}. For example, during the last few years,
businesses in the USA were often hacked and spied on by the Chinese
military. These intrusions were mostly cyber-economic-espionage and were
said to have supported the theft of billions of dollars' worth of
intellectual property (Bamford, 2016). [In]{.underline} September [2015,
the USA and China signed an agreement engaging both countries not to
support or conduct cyber-theft of intellectual property]{.underline}.
Moreover, the parties have made the commitment not to use cyberattacks
against each other's critical infrastructures in peace-time and to
support the establishment of international behavioral norms in
cyberspace (Rosenfeld, 2015). [Both states also highlighted the fact
that they could not control each individual in their country and
therefore could not be held responsible for individual
acts.]{.underline} Since then it seems that the number of attacks on
commercial targets has diminished (Timm, 2016). Former President Obama
suggested the creation of a position of cybersecurity ambassador to deal
with bilateral or multilateral treaties concerning cyber-norms (Lee,
2016). For this kind of de-escalation to take effect, the termination of
the conflict at hand must be the stated aim of both parties. A clear
common understanding of the terms of agreement is required and must be
based on trust-building efforts, as well as the assurance of mutual
adherence. The difficulty of tracking the implementation of such
agreements in cyberspace has been an obstacle preventing more states
consenting to such solutions (Lin, 2012, pp. 62--64). Nevertheless, **[a
[dialogue on cyberspace]{.mark} already [exists]{.mark} between the USA
and Russia]{.underline}** since July 2013. This **[[cooperation
includes]{.underline}]{.mark}** Confidence Building Measures
(**[[CBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [such as the creation of working groups
on the issue of ICT security, exchange of information between the two
national]{.underline} Computer Emergency Response Teams
([[CERT]{.underline}), **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the creation of
a [direct communication]{.mark} line [to]{.mark} directly
[manage]{.mark} ICT [incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Segal, 2016; The
White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 2013). In October 2016,
former President Obama used the latter to inform Russian President Putin
that the USA was accusing Russia of interference in the election process
(Ignatius, 2016). Furthermore, Russia and the USA take part in the UN
GGE supporting the future establishment of international norms on
actions in cyberspace. [They stated that international law can be
applied in cyberspace and therefore, the rules of proportionality and
limited collateral damage should also be respected in
cyberattacks]{.underline} (Ignatius, 2016; United Nations General
Assembly, 2015). These examples demonstrate that **[even though the two
states are involved in a "tit-for-tat" logic in their relations on a
tactical level, [there was]{.mark} still a [dialogue on the strategic
level]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least until 2015. The recent
cyberattacks in USA and the election of Donald Trump as US President,
bring new uncertainties.

**[[No]{.mark}, the [US Won't Respond to]{.mark} A [Cyber]{.mark} Attack

building]{.underline} new [low-yield nuclear weapons to respond to a

reporters in the runup to the Friday release of the new Nuclear Posture
Review. "The people who say we lowered the threshold for the use of
nuclear weapons are saying, 'but we want these low-yield nuclear weapons

[[the threshold **hasn't changed**]{.mark} since]{.underline} the
[Obama]{.underline} administration's own nuclear posture review in 2010,
but a draft of the new review that leaked online caused a bit of drama
in its attempts to dispel "ambiguity." The new review gives examples of
"non-nuclear strategic attacks," Robert Soofer, deputy assistant
secretary for nuclear and missile defense policy, told reporters on
Thursday. "It could be catastrophic attacks against civilian
populations, against infrastructure. It could be an attack using a
non-nuclear weapon against our nuclear command-and-control \[or\]
early-warning satellites. But [[we **don't talk** about
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}." In his own conversation with reporters,
Selva broadened "early warning" systems to include ones that provide
"indications of warning that are important to our detection of an
attack." He also emphasized, "We never said 'cyber.'" [There's a reason
for that]{.underline}. While [[cyber]{.mark} attacks]{.underline} on
physical infrastructure can be very dangerous, they [[are **unlikely to
kill enough**]{.mark} people [to provoke a]{.mark} U.S. nuclear
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}. An National Academies of Science and
Engineering analysis of the vulnerability of U.S. infrastructure makes
that point. [A]{.underline} major [cyber attack could cut off electrical
power]{.underline}, resulting in "people dying from heat or cold
exposure, etc.," said Granger Morgan, co-director of the Carnegie Mellon
Electricity Industry Center and one of the chairs of the report. "A
large outage of long duration could cover many states and last for weeks
or longer. Whether and how many casualties there could be would depend
on things like what the weather was during the outage."
[It's]{.underline} a huge problem but [**[not]{.mark}** an event
[resulting in]{.mark} tens of [thousands of]{.mark} immediate
[deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}. Contrast that with a nuclear attack on a
city like Moscow, even one using a device of 6 kilotons, much smaller
than the ones the United States used against Japanese targets in World
War II. The immediate result: there would be 40,000 deaths, according to
the online nuclear simulation tool NukeMap. [Russia]{.underline} has
[demonstrated]{.underline} a [willingness]{.underline} to take down
power services with cyber attacks, as they did in Ukraine on Christmas
Eve 2015. [But]{.underline} these [[attacks were **brief** and occured
in]{.mark} the **context of [actual fighting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
other words, **[the [worst]{.mark}]{.underline}** cyber physical
**[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[top experts believe credible
likely [does not meet the threshold]{.mark} that the [Defense]{.mark}
Department [has]{.mark} set out [for]{.mark} deploying [a
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon]{.underline}**.

#### Cyber-attacks won't take down the grid

**Craig 16** (Victoria; Feb 2; Analyst at Fox Business, Citing the
Senior Manager of Industrial Control Systems at Mandiant, "The U.S.
Power Grid is \'Vulnerable,\' But Don\'t Panic Just Yet",
http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/02/02/u-s-power-grid-is-vulnerable-but-dont-panic-just-yet.html)

The idea of the nation\'s power grids becoming the next battleground for
cyber warriors could make hacking into consumers' credit card accounts
and personal information seem like child's play. [While U.S. power
companies are likely targeted by foreign governments]{.underline} and
others in increasingly sophisticated breaches, **[actually [shutting
off]{.mark} the lights]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline} **[causing
chaos]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[far more
[complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[than many pundits make it
seem.]{.underline} Dan [Scali]{.underline}, [senior manager of
industrial control systems at Mandiant, a cybersecurity consulting arm
of FireEye
([FEYE](http://www.foxbusiness.com/quote.html?stockTicker=FEYE)),]{.underline}
[explained]{.underline} that [while cyber criminals]{.underline} [may
gain [access]{.mark} to power and utility data systems]{.underline},
[it]{.underline} **[[doesn't]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily
**[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the result will be [a]{.mark} **power
[outage]{.mark}** []{.mark}and a **total takedown** of power grid
control systems.]{.underline} In other words, [the power [grid
is]{.mark} controlled by **[more than just]{.mark} a panel** of digital
[buttons. ]{.mark}]{.underline}["[Losing]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[control]{.mark} system is bad]{.underline} from the perspective that it
takes you out of your normal mode of operations of being able to control
everything from one command center, [but]{.underline} [it [**doesn't**
mean]{.mark} you've lost control or all the **[lights go
out]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[in the city\]," Scali explained. While many
of the systems have been modernized to include digitized control panels,
[if a hacker were to infiltrate the system, [a utility worker could
still]{.mark} have the ability to]{.underline} **[[manually
control]{.mark} the [machines]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}[by]{.underline} **[flipping a switch]{.underline}**, pushing a
button, or tripping a breaker. As the world saw with the recent attack
in Ukraine, which caused a blackout for 80,000 customers of the nation's
western utility, the biggest problem may be ensuring the power grid's
control systems are not vulnerable to cyber break ins. The January
attack in Ukraine was likely caused by a corrupted Microsoft Word
attachment that allowed remote control over the computer, according to
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Scali said [[there was **no
ev**]{.mark}**idence** from the incident in Ukraine that the hacker's
[**malware**]{.mark} was able to **physically [shut down]{.mark}** the
[power]{.mark}.]{.underline} "It wiped out machines, deleted all the
files. Kill disk malware made it impossible to remotely control things.
It caused chaos on the business network, and the area where control
system operations sat. But the attacker, we believe, would have had to
actually used the control system to cause load shedding, which caused
the power to go out, or trip breakers to cause the actual problem.
Malware itself didn't turn the power out," Scali said. He said what most
likely happened in that incident was the hacker stole user credentials
and logged into the system remotely. The bottom line: Yes, a similar
event could happen in the U.S. And corporate America is concerned. A
recent survey released in January on the state of information security,
conducted by consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers, showed
cybersecurity as one of the biggest concerns among the top brass at U.S.
power and utilities firms. Part of the problem, Brad Bauch, security and
cyber sector leader at PwC said, is the interconnectedness of the
industry's tools. "Utilities want to be able to get information out of
\[their\] systems to more efficiently operate them, and also share that
information with customers so they have more real-time information into
their usage," he explained. While allowing access to their own
consumption data allows the companies to give their customers more of
what they want, it also opens up a host of access points for hackers,
making the systems more vulnerable than they otherwise would be. But
[[to say]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} power [grid is susceptible to
cyber]{.mark} hackers [is]{.mark} a bit of an
**[oversimplification]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### No Russian war

But [**conventional wisdom** is]{.underline} often
**[wrong]{.underline}**, and so it is this time. The
[[hysteria]{.underline}]{.mark} that has engulfed public commentary
throughout Europe about this ostensibly dire military situation on the
brink of getting out of hand [[has **little**]{.mark}**, if any**,
[basis]{.mark} in fact. Both [sides]{.mark} in the standoff
**[exaggerate]{.mark}** the [tensions and]{.mark} **the [danger]{.mark}
of escalation**]{.underline}, and the risks of the military
moves---their own and their adversary's---supposedly driving these
tensions.

In reality, [**the military [balance]{.mark}** between Russia and NATO
[is **stable**]{.mark}, the **danger of [escalation]{.mark}** [is
hardly]{.mark} approaching **[critical]{.mark} levels**]{.underline},
and [little needs to be **done militarily** to defuse **the current
tensions**. The true [cause of]{.mark} the [tensions is **not
military**, but **political**]{.mark} **and diplomatic**. Until those
causes are **resolved**, [tensions]{.mark} between Russia and the West
will [remain **high**]{.mark}. The [likelihood of]{.mark} a **military
[confrontation]{.mark}** will remain **[low]{.mark}**]{.underline},
however, [[because **neither**]{.mark} **side's [posture]{.mark}**
[points to]{.mark}]{.underline} a heightened state of readiness or
[**[intent]{.mark}ion** [to go on]{.mark} the
[offensive]{.mark}]{.underline}. Until that changes, [**political and
diplomatic [tensions]{.mark}** will [remain]{.mark} **mere
[tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Neg---AT: Cyber Aff---Impact Defense---2NC 

#### Deterrence and norms solve cyberattacks

Moral Imperative." Philosophy & Technology,
doi:10.1007/s13347-017-0252-8

3.4 [The **Failure of Cyber Deterrence?** The potency of cyber
deterrence is difficult to judge]{.underline}. This is partly [because
there exists no consensus on what constitutes an act of
sufficient]{.underline} cyber [aggression]{.underline}. Therefore, it is
not entirely clear what is to be deterred. Where exactly the threshold
for response should be will be discussed in section three of this paper.
[For now]{.underline}, we can state that **[low-level [nuisance
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[are]{.mark} a **[daily]{.mark}
occurrence**]{.underline}. For example, U.S. military networks are
probed and scanned millions of times each day (Work 2015, 1). Similarly,
[acts of cyber espionage are reasonably common]{.underline}.
[[However]{.mark}, what is also [evident is the **lack of
major**]{.mark} **cyber [attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For a while,
Stuxnet, Wiper, Shamoon and Bronze Soldier appeared to signal the rise
of cyber attack as a potent new instrument of policy. However, **[medium
to [large]{.mark}-scale [attacks]{.mark} have essentially
[dried-up]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Indeed, reflecting the empirical
evidence, and marking a shift in tone, in his]{.underline} September
[2015 testimony]{.underline} to the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Director of National Intelligence, James [[Clapper]{.underline},
**[talked down]{.underline}**]{.mark} the possibility of **[[an
'electronic Pearl Harbor']{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead, he focused on
ongoing 'low-to-moderate' level threats (Clapper 2015, 2). What does
this all tell us? **[Is deterrence working?]{.underline}** If one
considers low-to-moderate threats as deterrable, then the answer would
seem to be no. From this perspective, and according to some policy
makers, deterrence is already failing. In a 2015 Senate Armed Services
Committee Hearing, Chairman John McCain was scathing in his assessment:
'Our adversaries view our response \... as timid and ineffectual. Put
simply, the problem is a lack of deterrence. The administration has not
demonstrated to our adversaries that the consequence of continued cyber
attacks against us outweigh the benefit.' (Takala 2015) However, [if we
take the view that cyber [deterrence should]{.mark}]{.underline} really
[[concern itself only with **large**]{.mark}**-scale
[attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the picture is]{.underline} more
**[positive]{.underline}**. Indeed, [Valeriano and
[Maness]{.mark}]{.underline} (2015) have
[[identified]{.underline}]{.mark} **[considerable]{.underline}** levels
of [**[restraint]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [state [cyber
behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}. This could be [[due to]{.mark} a **[lack
of confidence in the]{.mark} strategic [utility of]{.mark} cyber
[attack]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It may also reflect]{.mark} the
development of **[norms]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against
aggressive]{.underline} forms of [cyber behaviour [and]{.mark} the
efficacy of **[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed,
[norms]{.underline} increasingly [form part of '**complex deterrence'**,
within which military and non-military elements operate
together]{.underline}. In cyberspace, although a settled understanding
of universal rules of behaviour is still lacking, [[norms]{.mark} appear
to be [crystalis]{.mark}ing [around **acceptable**]{.mark}]{.underline}
forms of [**[intrusion]{.underline}** [rather than]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a **blanket [non-use]{.mark} position**]{.underline} (Stevens 2012,
25). [[This]{.mark} may [explain]{.mark} the continuance of [lowlevel
probes]{.mark} whilst large attacks have trailed off.]{.underline}

#### Grid collapse won't cascade -- [impossible]{.underline}

Chris **Marciano 16**, utilities worker and researcher, "Could
terrorists shut down the United State\'s entire power grid?",
https://www.quora.com/Could-terrorists-shut-down-the-United-States-entire-power-grid

Unlikely. First off, [[there are **three separate grids**]{.underline}
[in the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[US]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[the
Eastern]{.mark} Interconnect]{.underline}, [[the Western]{.mark}
Interconnect, [and Texas]{.mark}]{.underline} (called ERCOT). Yes, Texas
is its own entity. Don\'t act surprised. [[You can take an
electron]{.mark} and run it [from **Louisiana** to **Maine**,
**but**]{.mark} [**you can\'t go** to Houston or San Francisco]{.mark}.
Several changes were made due to the Northeast Blackout of 2003. [The
grid operates on a principle of **redundancy**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to
**avoid** **cascading failures**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [When a power
line fails]{.underline}, [[the electrons
**near-instantaneously**]{.mark} [go to other
lines]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If the addition of those electrons cause
these lines to overload and fail]{.underline}, the failures will
continue like a domino effect. [The [operators]{.mark} of the
grid]{.underline}, using fancy software, [**[manage the
grid]{.underline}** [so that]{.underline} **[no single
failure]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[leads]{.mark} [to a cascading
failure]{.mark}. If one failure does occur, [they
will]{.mark}]{.underline} [[make]{.underline} **[necessary
changes]{.underline}**]{.mark} to prevent another single failure from
causing a cascading failure; [[that could include a starting **reserve
generation**]{.mark} in particular areas]{.underline} (even if that
generating resource is more costly) [[or by **turning off the
power**]{.mark}]{.underline} of select areas.

#### No Russia war -- they won't risk it

Amy F. **Woolf 20**, Specialist in Nuclear Weapons Policy in the Foreign
Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of the Congressional Research
Service at the Library of Congress, received a Master's in Public Policy
from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1983,
"Russia's Nuclear Weapons: Doctrine, Forces, and Modernization",
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R45861.pdf

One analyst has postulated that [[Russia may actually]{.underline}
**[raise its nuclear threshold]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as it
bolsters]{.underline} its [conventional forces]{.underline}. According
to this analyst, "[[It is **difficult to understand** why]{.underline}
[Russia would]{.underline}]{.mark} [want to [pursue]{.mark} **military
[adventurism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that would risk]{.mark} **all-out
[confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with a **technologically
advanced**]{.mark} **and [nuclear-armed adversary like
NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[While]{.underline}
**[opportunistic]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} possibly even
**[reckless]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the [Putin]{.mark} regime **[does
not appear to be suicidal]{.mark}**]{.underline}." 144 [As a study
from]{.underline} the [RAND]{.underline} Corporation
[noted]{.underline}, [[Russia has "invested considerable sums in
developing]{.mark} and fielding long-range [conventional]{.mark} strike
[weapons]{.mark} since the mid-2000s [to provide]{.mark} Russian
[leadership with a **buffer** against]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[reaching
the nuclear threshold]{.underline}**]{.mark}---[a]{.underline} set of
conventional escalatory options that can achieve strategic effects
without resorting to nuclear weapons."145 Others note, however, that
Russia has integrated these "conventional precision weapons and nuclear
weapons into a single strategic weapon set," lending credence to the
view that Russia may be prepared to employ, or threaten to employ,
nuclear weapons during a regional conflict.

#### Russia war won't escalate

Amos **Zeeberg 18**, MA in Science Journalism from Boston University, BA
from Harvard University, Contributing Editor at Nautilus Magazine,
Freelance Science Journalist Based in Tokyo, "Why Hasn't the World Been
Destroyed in a Nuclear War Yet?," Nautilus Magazine, 1/15/2018,
<http://nautil.us/blog/-why-hasnt-the-world-been-destroyed-in-a-nuclear-war-yet>

But after all these nuclear near-misses, one starts to wonder if it
really is plain dumb luck. The Nash equilibrium accurately describes a
certain kind of rational, perfectly logical approach to choices under
conflict. And exactly in keeping with game theorists' advice, the USSR
and U.S. went to great lengths to make sure their arsenals would be
feared as legitimate threats. [Yet [**each time**]{.mark}
they]{.underline} had an opportunity to make good on those threats---to
launch a crushing response to an apparent attack or mercilessly exploit
a weakness, as many armchair analysts recommended---[**[something
held]{.mark} them [back]{.mark}**[: a **disobedient soldier**]{.mark}, a
**[circumspect engineer]{.mark}**, an **[optimistic leader]{.mark}**.
The two nations]{.underline} were engaged in a battle of wills, staring
each other in the eyes, and they [[**both blinked**.
**Repeatedly**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Maybe, when **millions of lives hang in the balance**, [people are
**not**]{.mark} **so [rationally cold-hearted]{.mark}** as those old
game-theory models imply. [Or]{.mark} maybe they're [using]{.mark} a
**[different]{.mark} kind of [rationality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
