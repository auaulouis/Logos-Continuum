#### Spreading capitalism creates [global prosperity]{.underline} and [environmental sustainability]{.underline}. Abandoning it is [disastrous]{.underline}.

[It is **not social policy** but **capitalism** that has **created
today's prosperity**]{.underline}.

What is important is that [what **made today's mass prosperity
possible** -- a phenomenon **unprecedented in history** --
was]{.underline} not social policy or social legislation, organised
trade union pressure, or corrective interventions in the capitalist
economy, but rather [**market capitalism** itself, due to its **enormous
potential for innovation** and the **ever-increasing productivity** of
human labour that resulted from it.]{.underline}

[Increasing prosperity and quality of life are **always the result** of
increasing labour productivity. **Only increased productivity** enabled
**higher social standards**, **better working conditions**, the
**overcoming of child labour**, a **higher level of education**, and the
**emergence of human capital**. This process]{.underline} of increasing
triumph over poverty and the constantly rising living standards of the
general masses [is taking place on a **global scale** -- but **only**
where the **market economy** and **capitalist entrepreneurship are able
to spread**]{.underline}.

From industrial overexploitation of nature to ecological awareness

[The **first phase** of]{.underline} industrialisation and [capitalism
was characterised by]{.underline} an enormous
**[consumption]{.underline}** of resources [and]{.underline} frequent
**[overexploitation]{.underline}** of nature, [which]{.underline} soon
[**gave the impression** that this process **could not be
sustainable**]{.underline}. Since the end of the 19th century,
[**disaster** and **doom** scenarios have **repeatedly been put
forward**, but]{.underline} in retrospect they [have **proved to be
wrong**: The combination of **technological innovation**, **market
competition**, and **entrepreneurial profit-seeking** (with the
compulsion to **constantly minimise costs**) have meant that these
scenarios **never occurred**. The **ever-increasing population** has
been **increasingly better supplied** thanks to **innovative
technologies**, **ever-increasing output** with **lower consumption** of
resources **less harmful** to the environment]{.underline} -- e.g.
[**less arable land** in agriculture, or **oil** and **electricity**
instead of **coal**]{.underline} for rapidly increasing mobility. [More
recent disaster scenarios]{.underline}, such as those [spread by
**reputable scientists**]{.underline} since the late 1960s and in the
1970s, [have also proved to be **inaccurate**]{.underline}.

[The **reason** things developed differently was the **always
underestimated innovative dynamism** of the **capitalist market
economy**, a **growing ecological awareness** and]{.underline}, as a
result, [legislative intervention that **took advantage** of the logic
of market capitalism]{.underline}: As a result of the ecological
movement that had come out of the United States since 1970, wise
legislation began to use the price mechanism to apply market incentives
to internalize negative externalities. [Environmental pollution was
**given a price-tag**]{.underline}.

[This led to an **enormous decrease in air pollution** and **other
ecological consequences** of growth, which is **only possible in free**,
**market-based societies**, because the production process here is
characterized by **competition** and **constant pressure to reduce
costs**]{.underline}, i.e. [to the **most profitable use** of
resources]{.underline}. On the other hand, **[all forms of
socialism]{.underline}**, i.e. a state-controlled economy, [have proved
to be **ecological disasters** and have left behind **destruction of
gigantic proportions**, without providing the population with
**anything** that is **near comparable in prosperity**, often even by
**destroying existing prosperity**, such as happened in
**Venezuela**]{.underline}.

Capitalist profit motive combined with digitalization as a solution:
Increasing decoupling of growth and resource consumption

Moreover, [**technological innovations** combined with **capitalist
profit-seeking** and **market competition** have led to a new and
surprising phenomenon]{.underline} over the past decades, [which is
still **hardly noticed**]{.underline} in the public debate: [the
**decoupling** of growth and resource consumption]{.underline}
("**[dematerialization]{.underline}**"). [In a **wide variety** of
industrial sectors, the developed countries]{.underline}, above all the
U.S., [are now achieving **ever greater productive output** with
**increasingly fewer resources**]{.underline}. This has a lot to do with
technology, especially the digitalization of the economy and of our
entire lives.

As the well-known MIT professor Andrew McAfee shows in his book More
from Less, published in October 2019, [this]{.underline} process also
[follows the logic of **capitalist profit maximization**]{.underline}.
To get it going, we do not need politics, even though wise, properly
incentivizing legislation can be helpful and sometimes necessary. Above
all, however, it is [the **combination of technological innovation**,
**capitalist profit-seeking**, and **market-based entrepreneurial
competition**]{.underline} that [will]{.underline} also
**[solve]{.underline}** the problem of man-made **[global
warming]{.underline}**.

In addition, [**property rights** and their protection are **decisive**
for the **careful use of natural resources**]{.underline}. And where
this is not possible, legal support for collective self-governing
structures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, are
important---as is analysed by Nobel Economic Prize winner Elinor Ostrom.
By contrast, the growing ideologically motivated [**anti-capitalist
eco-activism**, and the policies influenced by it, are leading in the
**wrong direction**, **distracting precisely** from what would be **best
for the climate** and the **environment**---and **distracting us** from
what could **help protect us** against the **inevitable consequences of
global warming**]{.underline}.

#### Alt fails\-\--[transition wars]{.underline} and [domestic pressure]{.underline} means the alt [abandons fidelity]{.underline} to the environment.

**Smith \'19** \[Noah; 4/5/19; Bloomberg Opinion columnist, former
assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University; \"Dumping
Capitalism Won't Save the Planet,\"
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/capitalism-is-more-likely-to-limit-climate-change-than-socialism\]

[It has become **fashionable**]{.underline} on social media and [in
certain publications to argue that **capitalism is killing the
planet**]{.underline}. Even renowned investor Jeremy Grantham, hardly a
radical, made that assertion last year. [The **basic idea** is that the
**profit motive** drives the **private sector** to **spew
carbon**]{.underline} into the air with reckless abandon. Though many
economists and some climate activists believe that the problem is best
addressed by modifying market incentives with a carbon tax, [many
activists believe that the problem can't be addressed **without
rebuilding** the **economy**]{.underline} along centrally planned lines.

[The climate threat is certainly dire]{.underline}, and carbon taxes are
unlikely to be enough to solve the problem. [But eco-socialism
is]{.underline} probably [**not** going to be an **effective method** of
addressing that threat. **Dismantling** an **entire economic system** is
**never easy**, and probably would **touch off armed conflict** and
**major asdasd upheaval**. In the scramble to win those battles, even
the socialists would almost certainly abandon their limitation on
**fossil-fuel use**]{.underline} --- [either to support **military
efforts**, or to keep the population from turning against them. The
precedent here is the **Soviet Union**, whose multidecade effort to
**reshape its economy** by **force** amid **confrontation** with the
West led to profound **environmental degradation**. The world\'s climate
does not have several decades to spare]{.underline}.

[Even **without international conflict**, there's **little guarantee**
that moving away from capitalism would **mitigate our impact** on the
environment]{.underline}. Since socialist leader Evo Morales took power
[in Bolivia, living standards have improved substantially]{.underline}
for the average Bolivian, which is great. [But this has come at the cost
of higher emissions. Meanwhile, the capitalist U.S managed to **decrease
its per capita emissions**]{.underline} a bit during this same period
(though since the U.S. is a rich country, its absolute level of
emissions is much higher).

In other words, [in terms of **economic growth** and **carbon
emissions**, Bolivia looks]{.underline} similar to more
[capitalist]{.underline} developing countries. [That suggests that
**faced with a choice** of enriching their people or helping to save the
climate, even **socialist leaders** will often choose the former. And
that same political calculus will probably hold in China and the
U.S.,]{.underline} the world's top carbon emitters --- [leaders who
demand **draconian cuts** in **living standards** in pursuit of
environmental goals will have **trouble staying in power**]{.underline}.

[The **best hope** for the climate therefore lies in **reducing the
tradeoff** between **material prosperity** and **carbon emissions**.
That requires **technology**]{.underline} --- [**solar**, **wind** and
**nuclear power**, **energy storage**, **electric cars** and other
vehicles, carbon-free cement production and so on. The **best climate
policy** plans all involve **technological improvement** as a **key
feature**.]{.underline}

#### The alt [locks in extinction]{.underline} if they're right about [environmental sustainability]{.underline}\-\--there [isn't time]{.underline} for a [global transition]{.underline} from capitalism and [no certainty]{.underline} it [ends emissions]{.underline}.

There are important elements of truth in such views, but we should also
be careful to not push this point too far. [Some commentators have
argued that one **silver lining** outcome of the **pandemic** was that,
because of the **economic lockdown**, **fossil fuel** consumption and
**CO2 emissions** plunged alongside overall **economic
activity**]{.underline} during the recession. While this is true, [I do
not see any positive lessons here with respect to advancing a **viable
emissions program** that can get us to **net zero** emissions by
**2050**]{.underline}. Rather, [the experience demonstrates why a
**degrowth approach** to **emissions reduction** is **unworkable**.
Emissions did indeed fall sharply because of]{.underline} the pandemic
and the [recession. But that is only because **incomes collapsed** and
**unemployment spiked** over this same period. This only **reinforces
the conclusion** that the **only effective** climate stabilization
**path** is the **Green New Deal**, as it is the only one that does not
require a **drastic contraction**]{.underline} (or "degrowth") [of jobs
and incomes to drive down emissions]{.underline}.

[A genuinely **positive development** of]{.underline} the pandemic and
[recession is that **progressive activists** around the world have
fought to include **Green New Deal investments** in their countries'
**economic stimulus**]{.underline} programs. [It is **critical** to
**keep pushing** the **development** and **success** of these
initiatives]{.underline}.

[In support of that end, we must **seriously consider** how to **best
maximize** both the **short-term stimulus**]{.underline} benefits [and
long-term impacts of Green New Deal programs]{.underline}. I know the
importance of such considerations from personal experience working on
the green investment components of the 2009 Obama American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act, in which \$90 billion of the \$800 billion total was
allocated to clean energy investments in the United States. The
principles underlying these investment components were sound, but the
people who worked on the program in its various stages, including
myself, did not adequately calculate the time necessary to execute many
of the projects. We knew that it was critical to identify "shovel-ready"
projects---ones that could be quickly implemented on a large scale and
provide an immediate economic boost. But relatively few green investment
projects were truly shovel-ready at that time, as the green energy
industry was still a newly emerging enterprise. Therefore, the backlog
of significant new projects was thin. It is only moderately less thin
today.

This means that people designing Green New Deal stimulus programs must
identify the subgroup of green investment projects that can
realistically roll into action at scale within a matter of months. One
example that should be applicable in almost every country would be
energy efficiency retrofits of all public and commercial buildings. This
would entail improving insulation, sealing window frames and doors,
switching over all lightbulbs to LEDs, and replacing aging heating and
air conditioning systems with efficient ones (preferably heat pumps).
These programs could quickly generate large numbers of jobs for
secretaries, truck drivers, accountants, construction workers, and
climate engineers. They could also save energy and reduce emissions
quickly and relatively cheaply. Building off of such truly shovel-ready
projects, the rest of the clean energy investment program could then
accelerate and provide a strong foundation for economies moving out of
recession and onto a sustainable recovery path.

CP: [Eco-socialism is becoming a major tenet of the **ideological
repertoire**]{.underline} of green parties in European countries and
elsewhere, which may be the reason for their increasing appeal with
voters and especially the youth. Is eco-socialism a cohesive enough
political project to be taken seriously as an alternative for the
future?

NC: Insofar as I understand eco-socialism---not in great depth---it
overlaps greatly with other left socialist currents. That being said, [I
don't think we're at a stage where **adopting** a **specific "political
project"** is very helpful. There are **crucial issues** that **have**
to be **addressed**, **right now**. Our efforts should be **informed**
by the kind of **future society** that we want, and the kind that **can
be constructed** within our existing society]{.underline}. It's fine to
stake out specific positions about the future in more or less detail,
but for now these seem to me at best ways of sharpening ideas rather
that platforms to latch on to.

[A **good argument** can be made that **inherent features** of
capitalism lead]{.underline} inexorably [to the ruin of the environment,
and that **ending capitalism** must be a **priority** of the
environmental movement. But there's one **fundamental problem** with
this argument:]{.underline} [**time scales**. Dismantling capitalism is
**impossible in the time frame that we have** for taking urgent action,
which requires **national** and **international** mobilization if
**severe crisis** is to be averted]{.underline}.

[Furthermore, the whole discussion]{.underline} around eco-socialism [is
**misleading**. The **two efforts**]{.underline}---[averting
**environmental disaster**, and **dismantling capitalism** in favor of a
**freer** and more **just society**]{.underline}---[should and can
**proceed in parallel**]{.underline}. One [example is Tony Mazzocchi's
efforts to **forge a labor coalition** that would not only **challenge**
owner-**management control** of the workplace, but also be at the
**forefront** of the **environmental movement** while attempting to
**socialize major sectors** of U.S. industry. There's **no time to
waste**. The struggle must be]{.underline}, and can be, [undertaken on
all fronts.]{.underline}

CP: Bob, in your view, can eco-socialism coexist with the Green New Deal
project? And, if not, what type of a politico-ideological agenda might
be needed to generate broad political participation in the struggle to
create a green future?

RP: In my view, [details of rhetoric and emphasis aside, eco-socialism
and the Green New Deal are fundamentally the same project.]{.underline}
[The Green New Deal, as we have discussed the term, offers the **only
path to climate stabilization** that can also expand **good job
opportunities** and **raise living standards** in **all regions** of the
world. It defines an **explicit** and **viable alternative** to
austerity economics on a **global scale**]{.underline}. My coworkers and
I have worked on this issue---advancing the Green New Deal as an
alternative to austerity economics---in different country settings over
the past few years, including in Spain, Puerto Rico, and Greece. [In my
view, the Green New Deal is the **only approach to climate
stabilization** also **capable** of **reversing rising inequality** and
**defeating** global **neoliberalism** and]{.underline} ascendant
**[neofascism]{.underline}**.

[Beyond the Green New Deal, I don't know what exactly "eco-socialism"
could mean. Does it mean the **overthrow** of **all private ownership**
of productive assets for public ownership?]{.underline} As Noam
suggested, [do people **seriously think** that this could happen within
the **time frame we have** to stabilize the climate, that
is]{.underline}, within [less than **thirty years**? And are we certain
that eliminating all private ownership would be workable or desirable
from a **social justice** standpoint]{.underline}---i.e. from the
standpoint of advancing well-being for the global working class and
poor? [How do we deal with the fact that **most** of the world's
**energy assets** are **already publicly owned**]{.underline}? How,
[more specifically, can we be **certain** that a transition to
**complete public ownership** would itself deliver zero net emissions by
2050? To me, the **overarching challenge** is trying to understand
**alternative pathways** to most **effectively building** truly
egalitarian, democratic, and ecologically sustainable
societies]{.underline}---[putting all labels aside and being willing, as
**Marx** himself insisted, to employ "ruthless criticism" toward all
that exists, including all past experiences with Communism and
Socialism.]{.underline} And, for that matter, being open to criticizing
all authors, including Marx himself. Indeed, my favorite quote from Marx
is "I am not a Marxist."

### AFF\-\--Cap K\-\--Perm

#### The perms solve best -- restructuring capitalism is possible

**Mazzucato '21** \[Mariana; Jan 28; Professor in the Economics of
Innovation and Public Value at University College London where she is
the founding director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public
Purpose; "Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism," p.
204-10\]

This book has applied what I believe is the immensely powerful idea of a
mission to solving the 'wicked' problems we face today. In it, I have
argued that [tackling grand challenges will only happen if we reimagine
**government as a prerequisite for restructuring capitalism** in a way
that is inclusive, sustainable and **driven by
innovation**.]{.underline}

First and foremost, this means reinventing government for the
twenty-first century -- equipping it with the tools, organization and
culture it needs to drive a mission-oriented approach. It also means
bringing purpose to the core of corporate governance and taking a very
broad stakeholder position across the economy. It means changing the
relationship between public and private sectors, and between them and
civil society, so they all work symbiotically for a common goal. The
reason for the emphasis on rethinking government is simple: **[only
government has the capacity to bring about transform]{.underline}**ation
**[on the scale needed.]{.underline}** The relationship between economic
actors and civil society shows our problems at their most profound, and
this is what we must unravel.

[We can start by recognizing that capitalist markets are an outcome of
how each actor in the system is organized and governed, and how the
different actors relate to one another]{.underline}. This holds for the
private and public sectors and for other sectors such as non-profits.
**[No particular kind of market behaviour is inevitable]{.underline}**.
[For example, the market pressure often cited as forcing a business to
neglect the long term in favour of the short term, as too many companies
do today, is the product of a particular organization of the
market]{.underline}. **[Nor is there anything inevitable in government
bureaucracies]{.underline}** [being too slow to react to challenges such
as digital platforms and climate change.]{.underline} Rather, [both are
outcomes of agency, actions and **governance** structures that are
chosen inside organizations, as well as the legal and institutional
relationships between them. It is all down to design within and between
organizations.]{.underline}

Capitalism is, indeed, in crisis. But the good news is that we can do
better. We know from the past that public and private actors can come
together to do extraordinary things. I have reflected on how, fifty
years ago, going to the moon and back required public and private actors
to invest, to innovate and to collaborate night and day for a common
purpose. Imagine if that [collaborative purpose]{.underline} today was
to [build a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism: green production
and consumption]{.underline}, [less inequality]{.underline}, greater
personal fulfilment, **[resilient health care]{.underline}** and healthy
ageing, sustainable mobility and digital access for all. But small,
incremental changes will not get us to those outcomes. We must have the
courage and conviction to lift our gaze higher -- to lead transformative
change that is as imaginative as it is ambitious, aiming for something
far more ambitious than sending a man to the moon.

To do this successfully, [governments need to invest in their internal
capabilities -- building the competence and confidenc]{.underline}e to
think boldly, partner with business and civil society, catalyse new
forms of collaboration across sectors, and [deploy instruments that
reward actors willing to engage with the difficulties]{.underline}. The
task is neither to pick winners nor to give unconditional handouts,
subsidies and guarantees, but to pick the willing. And missions are
about making markets, not only fixing them. They're about imagining new
areas of exploration. They're about [**taking risks**, not only
'de-risking']{.underline}. And if this means making mistakes along the
way, so be it. Learning through trial and error is critical for any
value-creation exercise. [Ambitious missions also have the courage to
tilt the playing field.]{.underline}

If [government]{.underline} is indeed a value creator that is driven by
public purpose, its [policies should reflect and reinforce]{.underline}
that. Too many green policies today are just minor adjustments to a
trajectory that still favours the old waste-prone behaviours and the
financial casino that worsens inequality. [A healthy economy that works
for the whole of society must tilt the playing field consistently to
reward behaviours that help us achieve agreed and desirable
goals.]{.underline} That means achieving [coherence in a **multiplicity
of fields**]{.underline}, from **[taxes]{.underline}** to
**[regulation]{.underline}**, from **[business law]{.underline}** to the
**[social safety net]{.underline}**.

As emphasized throughout the book, [it is key to not pretend that social
missions are the same as technological ones]{.underline}. With
challenges that are more 'wicked' it is essential that moonshot thinking
is linked with support to underlying government systems. For example, a
[moonshot around]{.underline} disease testing or **[health
priorities]{.underline}** [must interact closely with the public-health
system, not **replace** or **circumvent** it]{.underline}. Similarly, a
moonshot around [clean growth]{.underline} must [interact with transport
systems and planning authorities and understand behavioural
change]{.underline}. Thus it is [critical to]{.underline} perceive
missions not as siloed projects but as being intersectoral, bottom-up,
and [building on existing]{.underline} systems (such as **[innovation
systems]{.underline}**, among others).

Governments cannot pursue missions alone. They must work alongside
purpose-driven businesses to achieve them. As I've argued in this book,
this requires addressing one of the biggest [dilemmas of modern
capitalism]{.underline}: **[restructuring business]{.underline}** [so
that private profits are reinvested back into the economy rather than
being used for short-term financialized purposes]{.underline}. Missions
can accelerate this shift by shaping expectations about where business
opportunities lie and also getting a better return for public
investment. In this sense they can begin to walk the talk of stakeholder
value. This means creating a more symbiotic form of partnership and
collaboration in different sectors, whether in health, energy or digital
platforms. A market-shaping perspective requires governing these
interactions so that intellectual property rights, data privacy, pricing
of essential medicines and taxation all reflect what needs to happen to
reach the common objective. [In health that must mean health innovation
driven by the mission of better health care for all; in energy it must
mean divestment from fossil fuels and the creation of public goods like
green infrastructure and green production systems]{.underline} that
protect the earthly oasis that Armstrong referred to; and in the digital
domain it must mean the use of [digitalization to improve the access of
all people to the power of the technologies of the twenty-first
century]{.underline} -- while ensuring both data privacy and that our
welfare states are strengthened, not weakened, by digital platforms.

**[Doing capitalism differently]{.underline}** [requires reimagining the
full potential of a public sector driven by public purpose --
democratically defining clear goals]{.underline} that society needs to
meet by investing and **[innovating together]{.underline}**. It requires
a fundamentally new relationship between all economic actors willing and
able [to tackle complexity to achieve outcomes that matter.]{.underline}
