#### NATO is the militarized front for racial capitalism on both a material and ideological level -- psy-ops, imperialism, and weaponization of everything overcodes every move to peace the aff will claim and means their ASSURANCES shore up western imperialism.

**Campbell, 19** \[Horace, Professor of African American Studies and
Political Science @ Syracuse,  author of [Global NATO and the
Catastrophic Failure in Libya]{.underline} (Monthly Review Press, 2013):
"[Global NATO: A 70-Year Alliance of Oppressors in
Crisis](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/09/global-nato-a-70-year-alliance-of-oppressors-in-crisis/),"

The celebration of [NATO's 70 years of existence provides]{.underline}
another [opportunity to unearth the real history of the ideas, practices
and destruction wrought by this military alliance. Even
with]{.underline} the clear [exposure of the cooperation between NATO,
the CIA and the British MI6 to spread terror and psychological
warfare]{.underline} in Europe immediately after the formation of this
military alliance, the [mainstream media, academics and policy makers
remain silent on]{.underline} activities of the 'stay behind armies' and
['false flag' operations that distorted the real causes of
insecurity]{.underline} in the world after 1945. The evidence of the
manipulations of the peoples of the world to ensure the continued
survival of NATO has been well documented in the fraudulent
interventions and bombings in the Balkans right up the present multiple
wars against the peoples of Iran. Vijay Prashad had [identified NATO as
the prime defender of]{.underline} the Atlantic project. This Atlantic
project, he noted was, "a fairly straightforward campaign by the
[propertied classes]{.underline} to maintain or restore their [position
of dominance]{.underline}." This Atlantic Project was anchored in the
military alliance called NATO with its principal work, that of reversing
the South Project; the struggles for peace bread and justice by the
poorer citizens of the planet, especially those who had emerged on the
world stage after the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.
[The ostensive reason for **the founding of NATO was to 'thwart' Soviet
aggression, but in practice the organization was a prop for western
capital** and]{.underline} after the fall of the Berlin Wall, became the
core prop for [Wall Street]{.underline}. In this year, there will be
many commentaries on the fact that the existence of NATO reflects a Cold
War relic, that NATO is obsolete and lost its mandate, but very few will
link the expansion of NATO to the military management of the
international system. Prior to 1991, the planners of NATO could justify
the existence of NATO on ideological and political grounds, but with the
threat of a multi polar world and the diminution of the dollar, NATO
expanded to the point where this author joined with others in labelling
this organization Global NATO to reflect its current imperial mandate.
[The Global thrust of NATO now comprises 29 members from Europe and
North America along with 41 'partners' that had started off under the
banner of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council]{.underline} (NACC) in
1991. [Since that time, NATO has launched a lengthy war without end in
Afghanistan, colluded in the destruction of Iraq and conspired with
militarists to forge 'Partnership for Peace']{.underline}
([with]{.underline} most **[members of the former Warsaw Pact
states]{.underline}**). The core 29 members are now enmeshed with
treaties and undertakings from states involved in the Mediterranean
Dialog and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and
United Arab Emirates. There are also [the 'partners' from across the
globe: Afghanistan, Australia, Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan]{.underline}. This enlargement
[served the military purposes of encircling China and
Russia]{.underline} who military planners in the West targeted. There is
no shortage of literature on NATO and its milestones, but very [few have
documented the real crimes of this **global network of anticommunist
operatives who precipitated real terror and psychological
warfare**]{.underline} against the citizens of Europe and North America
[while supporting]{.underline} mass [atrocities from Algeria to
Indonesia]{.underline}, and South Africa. Books such as that of NATO's
Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe by
Danielle Ganser and The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and
Their Secret World War, by Stephen Kinzer used rigorous research
techniques to uncover the dark history of NATO. These two books can be
distinguished from the bland international relations texts that
discusses NATO inside the old calculations of 'strategy,' 'concert of
democracies', 'security cooperation' and the balance of power,' and
spheres of influence. Most recently, this IR rendering of the history of
NATO has been served up in a document entitled, NATO at Seventy: An
Alliance in Crisis. Published by Harvard University with one of the
coauthors being a former US ambassador to NATO. This document spelt out
ten challenges.\[1\] However, in a testimony before Congress, Nicolas
Burns boiled down the challenge of NATO to one objective; that the
current role of NATO must be to contain Russia and China.\[2\] On the
day before the actual 70thanniversary, on April 3, the Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg delivered an address to a joint session of the US
Congress advocating an expansion of the alliance while promoting a
military buildup against Russia. \[3\] European progressives will have
to reflect deeply on whether the current sanctions regime and the
special propose vehicle called the Instrument in Support of Trade
Exchanges (INSTEX), is ushering in another round of inter imperialist
rivalry reminiscent of the currency wars of 1929-1939. Then, the
[shifting alliances yielded confusion among **working peoples who
ultimately went to fight against each other** in Europe, spreading
barbarism throughout the world, from Auschwitz to
Hiroshima.]{.underline} The continued struggles for bread, peace and
justice ensure that it is only the authoritarian leaders from the Global
South who are compromised on the real meaning of the existence of NATO.
In the present era, [there is a new capitalist competition
while]{.underline} North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}) [serves as **an integral part of the Pentagon's
world command structure**.]{.underline} Recent experiences have
demonstrated in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya that [the moguls of Wall
Street are willing to **wage as many wars, to destroy as many countries
and to kill as many people as necessary to achieve the dominance of US
capitalism**. The destruction of Libya was a classic example of the
**convergence of finance as warfare, the weaponization of information
and incessant bombing to destroy a society**.]{.underline} Where at the
start of NATO the war scare was the propaganda method, [In
the]{.underline} current [digital age, **brain hacking and the
engineering of smart phones** have placed]{.underline} the [giant
technology firms]{.underline} of Apple , Google, Amazon, Microsoft,
Facebook [at the forefront of the new weapons platform of NATO and Wall
Street.]{.underline} This analysis is in three parts spelling out the
rationale for the call for all progressive forces to join together to
concentrate their energies in the dismantling of NATO. NATO at Birth:
Stay behind armies, directed terrorist organizations and psychological
warfare against Europeans. In the period after the fall of the Berlin
Wall there were major press reports on the role of NATO's stay behind
armies that had been operating inside Western Europe since 1949.Ten
years earlier, when [the kidnapping and killing of the former Italian
Prime Minister, Aldo Moro]{.underline} rocked western Europe, it emerged
that his demise [had been authored by]{.underline} clandestine
paramilitary network code-named ["Operation Gladio"]{.underline} that
was a false flag operation of NATO. Danielle Ganser's book, NATO's
Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe had
meticulously documented how [NATO funded and often even **directed
terrorist organizations throughout Europe in what was termed a "strategy
of tension" with the aim of preventing a rise of the left** in Western
European politics]{.underline}. NATO's "secret armies" engaged in
subversive and criminal activities in several countries. In the specific
case of Italy, Aldo Moro had committed the unforgivable crime of
contemplating a government that included Italians who belonged to the
Italian Communist Party Right from the start of the Cold war, [the **CIA
and MI6 had worked closely with former fascists** to oppose]{.underline}
citizens and [organizations]{.underline} in Western Europe [that were
anti-capitalists]{.underline}. Under the leadership of US planners such
as Allen Dulles, William Colby, Frank Wisner and later James Angleton,
these operatives weaned and nursed a network of agents and secret arms
dumps across Europe, a network that would remain secret but active
throughout the Cold War. \[4\] Ganser elaborated on the extensive
operations of Operation Gladio all across Europe with the explicit aim
of subverting the democratic wishes of European citizens who were
opposed to oppression. It is worth quoting at length the role of the
secret armies. ["NATO's "secret armies"]{.underline} engaged in
subversive and criminal activities in several countries. [In
Turkey]{.underline} in 1960, the stay behind army, working with the
army, [staged a coup d'état and killed Prime Minister]{.underline} Adnan
[Menderes; in Algeria]{.underline} in 1961, the French stay-behind army
[staged a coup]{.underline} with the CIA against the French government
of Algiers, [which ultimately failed;]{.underline} in 1967, [the Greek
stay-behind army staged a coup and imposed a military
dictatorship]{.underline}; in 1971 in [Turkey]{.underline}, [after a
military coup]{.underline}, the stay-behind army [engaged in "domestic
terror" and killed hundreds]{.underline}; in 1977 [in Spain, the stay
behind army carried out a massacre in Madrid]{.underline}; in 1980 in
Turkey, the head of the stay behind army staged a coup [and]{.underline}
took power; in 1985 [in Belgium, the stay behind attacked and shot
shoppers randomly in supermarkets]{.underline}, killing 28; in
Switzerland in 1990, the former head of the Swiss stay behind wrote the
US Defense Department he would reveal "the whole truth," and was found
the next day stabbed to death with his own bayonet; and in 1995, England
revealed that the MI6 and SAS helped set up stay behind armies across
Western Europe."\[5\] The mainstream media and University commentaries
have not been able to confront this history in so far as the
manipulation and deception that gave rise to the birth of NATO is still
at work against the citizens of Europe and the United States. War Scare,
NATO and psychological warfare against the citizens of Europe and North
America. [At the end of World War II, the defense Industries in the USA
had been faced with the choice of conversion and retooling]{.underline}
the [factories that made weapons or continue]{.underline} the [massive
subsidies for]{.underline} the [industries vested in
military]{.underline} and armaments [production. The choice
was]{.underline} eventually made to [embark on]{.underline} [**a
propaganda war scare to justify the need for an expanded army** and it
was in this context when NATO was conceived. To sustain the WW II
armaments enterprise, there needed to be **a cycle of war scare and the
fabrication and inflation of threats and enemies**.]{.underline} It was
in this context that Lawrence D. Bell, President of Bell Aircraft
Corporation, in a statement to [the U.S. Air Policy
Commission]{.underline} Finletter Commission) on September 29, 1947,
[stated that "**as soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money
available**."]{.underline} \[6\] According to Andrew Cockburn, "The
aircraft corporations that had garnered enormous profits during the war
on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that peace
was ruinous. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was
proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of
wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by
the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never
lived up to expectations, while efforts to diversify into other
products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved
disappointing and costly." \[7\] [In]{.underline} the spring of [1948,
the U.S. Secretary of Defense]{.underline} James Forrestal and top
officials of the Harry Truman administration [began to sound alarm about
a looming Soviet attack against Western Europe. It is]{.underline} now
[known]{.underline}, [from declassified documents, that the **officials
were aware that there was no credible evidence**]{.underline} to back up
their war scare. Some analysts have argued that the war scare of 1948
was devised to save the aircraft manufacturing industry from plunging
into bankruptcy. And this goal was achieved. In the book Harry S. Truman
and the War Scare of 1948, Frank Kofsky states thatwithin 2 months of
the emergence of the scare, the Trumanadministration revamped the
aircraft industry by embarking on a 57% increase in purchase of military
aircraft, and the total budget of the Pentagon was increased by 30%.
[NATO was born]{.underline} on April 4, 1949 [out of this propaganda war
to deceive the US citizens about a pending attack of the Soviet
Union]{.underline} on Western Europe. [The task of organizing the
deception]{.underline} of the citizens of the West [was assigned to the
C]{.underline}entral [I]{.underline}ntelligence [A]{.underline}gency.
There are now so many books and articles on the role of the CIA in
deception, propaganda and psychological warfare that we will not spend a
great deal of time on the role of the Covert agencies in giving
legitimacy to the idea of a Soviet threat. Stephen Kinzer and David
Talbot are two writers who have documented extensively how the Dulles
brothers ensnared every major profession in the USA in this deception.
\[8\] It was especially chilling how **[Universities were suborned to be
surrogates for this psychological warfare]{.underline}**. Noam Chomsky
has dealt with this aspect of the period of the birth of NATO in the
work on the Universities and the Cold War.\[9\] Racists and
anticommunists in the propaganda war It was not by accident that [the
thinkers and **planners of these secret operations were known racists
and Nazi sympathizers**.]{.underline} Frank Wisner who hailed from
Mississippi in the USA was a good example of the upright US citizen who
was an architect of the false flag operations and the deception
associated with NATO and western intelligence agencies. After the War,
in 1948 Frank Wisner was appointed director of the Office of Special
Projects. Soon afterwards under the direction of Allen Dulles, this
Office of Special Projects was renamed [the]{.underline} Office of
Policy Coordination (OPC). This became the [espionage and
counter-intelligence branch of the C]{.underline}entral
[I]{.underline}ntelligence [A]{.underline}gency. Later James Jesus
Angleton was to take this brand of counter intelligence work to the
highest levels of state assassinations. Wisner [had been
mandated]{.underline} told [to create]{.underline} an organization that
concentrated on ["propaganda, economic warfare; preventive direct
action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition and evacuation
measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to
underground resistance groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist
elements in threatened countries of the free world."]{.underline} It was
from this opaque sounding name of Office of Policy Coordination where
the brainwashing and virulent anti-communism of the Cold War era was
refined. Evan Thomas reported in The Very Best Men: the Daring Early
Days of the CIA, the OPC's charter gave it responsibility for
"propaganda, economic warfare; preventative direct action, including
sabotage, antisabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion
against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance
groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened
countries of the free world." NATO as the principal prop for
international capitalism today. In the celebratory events to memorialize
the founding of NATO in 1949, it is usually forgotten that when the
North American Treaty was signed in April 1949 most of the founding
members were colonial overlords. [**Colonialism and imperialism took a
new form** under the leadership of US capitalists defending the dollar
and Wall Street.]{.underline} At that historical moment in 1949, [the
justification]{.underline} for starting this organization
[was]{.underline} that it constituted [a system of **collective
defense**]{.underline} whereby its member states agreed to mutual
defense in response to an attack by any external party. The external
party in question at that time was the USSR; insofar as NATO had been
formed as an alliance ostensibly to defend Western Europe against
'communist expansion'. In the Treaty's renowned Article 5, the new
Allies agreed "an armed attack against one or more of them... shall be
considered an attack against them all." **[The US military and
industrial leaders studied the terror and propaganda tactics of the
Nazis]{.underline}** in order [to learn the lessons of how to develop an
efficient military machine.]{.underline} James Whitman in the book,
Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race
Law, outlined what the fascists had learnt from the eugenics movement in
the United States.\[10\] Although many anti-fascist scientists from
Germany had found a place in the US academy, [the top planners of the
Cold War **linked the US primacy to the global history of racism to the
efficient, bureaucratic and professionalism of conservative
Germany**.]{.underline} One of the unspoken aspects of the first years
of NATO was the question of containing the possible revolutionary
impulses of the German working peoples. To forestall such a possibility,
[the thinkers and planners of NATO collaborated with the former fascists
to learn their skills.]{.underline} The details of this alliance have
been spelt out in the book on the CIA by David Talbot in the book, The
Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's
Secret Government. [The **merging of fascist ideas with the ideas of Jim
Crow** in the United States were refined in]{.underline} the secret
operation called, [Operation Paperclip]{.underline}. Anne Jacobsen,
Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program to Bring Nazi
Scientists to America, \[11\] elaborated in great detail the secret
program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely
carried out by Special Agents of Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC),
in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians,
such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were taken from
Germany to America for U.S. government employment, primarily between
1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders,
of the Nazi Party. These elements were the foundation of a military
program that has brought us the weaponization of space. [The **creators
of NATO simultaneously mobilized the colonial and fascist elements** in
Belgium, Spain, Italy and France]{.underline}. Of the twelve [founding
members]{.underline}, six [were]{.underline} [outright colonial powers
and]{.underline} at [that]{.underline} moment, countries such as France,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and Portugal **[looked to the USA to
support their plunder of colonial societies]{.underline}**. In the
specific case of France, [in order **to assist French colonialism,
Algeria was named as a territory of NATO**.]{.underline} Sixty years
later when the President of France, Macron, apologized for the crimes of
killing more than one million Algerians, there is no reflection inside
western academic institutions on this role of NATO in Africa. Currently,
the French have been the most aggressive in promoting the fiction that
the defense radius of Europe stretches 4000 kilometers out from
Brussels, up to the arctic, well across the Russian frontier and down
into central Africa. It is not widely known that, initially, the
[Portuguese fascists were some of the principal beneficiaries of the
membership of NATO, with major **deployment of nuclear weapons in the
Azores as reward for the NATO support for colonialism** in Angola,
Mozambique, Guinea and other Portuguese outposts of colonial
domination.]{.underline} Prior to the formation of NATO in 1949, the
1947 document of [the State Department]{.underline} on Cooperative
Development of Africa had [stipulated that **colonialism would assist
the recovery of European capitalism**.]{.underline} \[12\]The State
Department had been explicit in outlining how cheap foodstuffs and raw
materials from Africa would assist Europe's recovery and create the
basis for unity and economic regeneration. [The USA set about creating a
number of international institutions to guarantee the survival of Europe
and of capitalism, the IMF]{.underline}, IBRD ([World
Bank]{.underline}), the [NATO]{.underline}, GATT, to [guarantee the
strength of the USA in international trade and finance]{.underline}. By
the time NATO was formed in 1949, the US planners had already made their
plans with Britain and France to extend their military control over
Africa. France was bequeathed the task of maintaining order in western
Africa while the British sought to maintain naval power incorporating
the British facilities from the Suez Canal down through Aden (Yemen), to
Mombasa (Kenya), Simons town [South Africa]{.underline} across to
Malaysia. \[13\] The racist [apartheid regime]{.underline} had
[persuaded NATO that it was necessary to integrate the South African
military into the western defense planning in order to protect the 'Cape
route.']{.underline} After the Suez crises of 1956 and the 1967 war this
alliance with the racist regime deepened. [Throughout its existence
**NATO assisted in the refinement of the racial status hierarchy in
which whites are dominant and people of color are
subordinate**.]{.underline} \[14\] [This **incorporation of racist ideas
into western defense** continued a **long tradition that shaped the
outlook of NATO** and reinforced the outlook of Frantz
Fanon]{.underline}: "Colonialism is violence in its natural state."
France and Britain excelled in this violence with the Belgians cementing
their communications and logistics coordination to kill Patrice Lumumba
and later support the killing of the Secretary General of the United
Nation, Dag Hammarskjold. \[15\] Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal
deepened their links to NATO but in 1956, Dwight Eisenhower halted the
planned offensive of the British and the French in the Suez war. After
this war, both the currencies of Britain and France suffered sharp
declines with France seeking cover inside the European Coal and Steel
Community (ECSC), while the British pound accepted its place as a prop
to the US dollar in the global economy. Within a year after the Suez
debacle, France had pushed for the Treaty of Rome that paved the way for
the European Economic Community to be a competitive force with US
capitalists. Within the context of the competition between European
capitalists and US capitalists, Charles De Gaulle exhibited pique at the
organization of NATO that supported the armaments culture of US capital.
Charles De Gaulle partially pulled France out of this alliance in 1966
after it became clear that this military organization was dominated by
the United States and Britain (supporting their military industries). De
Gaulle argued for an independent nuclear arsenal while remaining a
signatory to North Atlantic Treaty and participating in the North
Atlantic Council. Nicholas Sarkozy ended the farce when France returned
to the fold of the NATO military structures in 2009. The duplicitous
actions on the part of the French leadership were always based on
calculations meant to preserve the dominance of French capital in
Africa. When the US devalued the dollar in 1971 and broke the agreements
of the Bretton Woods Treaty, it was the French who complained about the
Exorbitant Privilege of the Dollar. For a short period, both the
President of France and the Chancellor of West Germany had chafed under
the privilege and had worked hard to bring into being the Maastricht
Treaty and the Europe Union to end the dominance of the dollar in the
international capitalist system. It was known than the one necessary
aspect of this emerging common currency in Europe would be the
dismantling of the military occupation of Europe by US military
personnel. Hence, both Giscard de Estaing and Helmut Schmidt had linked
the common currency, the European Central Bank and common foreign and
security policy (CFSP), with the expectation that ultimately Europe will
break from the traditions of NATO. It was in the face of this threat and
the fall of the centrally planned economy that the forward planners
expanded NATO. Emergence of Global NATO and the myth of 'humanitarian
intervention' [Usually, when an alliance is formed for a specific
purpose such as halting the spread of communism, that alliance is folded
when the mission is complete.]{.underline} Hence, after the fall of the
Soviet Union in 1991, it was expected by those seeking the 'peace
dividend' that the mission of NATO would be scaled down. [Instead, NATO
expanded, seeking to encircle Russia by extending its membership to
include former members of the Warsaw Pact countries.]{.underline}
Progressive scholars have documented the cynicism of the **[US military
planners who orchestrated the 'humanitarian intervention' in the Balkans
in order to advance the hegemony of US capitalism]{.underline}** [after
the fall of the Soviet Union.]{.underline} The scholarship on this
manipulation of the European working peoples to entrench NATO is rich
and needs to be revisited at this moment of the celebration of the
70thanniversary of the founding of NATO. Richard Aldrich in the book,
The Hidden Hand: Britain, America and Cold War Secret Intelligence'
brought out evidence to expose how the massacres in the Balkans, helped
give a new impetus to US hegemony.' \[16\] David Gibbs had argued, "How
the Srebrenica Massacre Redefined US Foreign Policy." It is worth
quoting at length how the Balkans war was used to manipulate public
opinion in Europe, "Perhaps most importantly, the massacre helped give a
new impetus to US hegemony, contributing to its post-Cold War
legitimacy. In bolstering America's hegemonic position, the significance
of [the Srebrenica massacre]{.underline} cannot be overstated: The
massacre [helped trigger a NATO bombing campaign that is]{.underline}
widely [credited with ending the Bosnian war]{.underline}, along with
the associated atrocities, and this campaign gave NATO a new purpose for
the post-Soviet era. Since that time, the Srebrenica precedent has been
continuously invoked as a justification for military force. [The
**perceived need to prevent massacres and oppression helped justify
later interventions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya**, as well
as the ongoing fight against ISIS.]{.underline} The recent UN doctrine
of Responsibility to Protect, which contains a strongly interventionist
tone, was inspired in part by the memory of Srebrenica." \[17\] The more
nefarious aspect of this manipulation of humanitarianism was the ways in
which elements such as Bernard Kouchner used their credentials as former
members of the left and progressive forces to give cover to US
imperialism. Since the war in the Balkans it is now accepted by the
military planners that humanitarian intervention acts as a force
multiplier. \[18\] This position was explicitly stated by General Colin
Powell who noted, "Just as surely as our diplomats and military,
American NGOs are out there serving and sacrificing on the front lines
of freedom NGOs are such a force multiplier for us, such an important
part of our combat team." These observations can shed light on the
relationship between NGOs such as Doctors without Borders and the
International Rescue Committee in global militarism. The fiction of
collective western security was effectively broken while [after the
Asian economic crisis, US capital mobilized NATO to defend Wall
Street.]{.underline} In this defense of Wall Street, [**NATO incessantly
bombed Kosovo for 79 days** in 1999 as it gave itself a new mission to
enlarge US military power right up to the doorstep of
Moscow.]{.underline} Gingerly, NATO expanded under US President Bill
Clinton from 12 members to 16, then to 19, then to 26 by 2004 and by
2009 to 28 members. Despite vocal opposition from Russia, [the
discussion of expanding NATO now proceeded to develop the idea of Global
NATO]{.underline}. In 2019 there were 29 members of NATO. In his
presentation before the US Congress Stoltenberg advocated for a further
expansion of NATO and boasted of the high state of readiness of the NATO
Response Force (NRF) which had been created in 2002. NATO and the
Weaponization of finance **[Global NATO was the preeminent force to
orchestrate the weaponization of everything.]{.underline}** Michael
Hudson has [outlined]{.underline} finance as warfare and [the
weaponization of finance in the current phase of
imperialism.]{.underline} It will be important to grasp the present
sanctions regime of the USA as a form of warfare. In the current
literature on imperialism, the term weaponization of finance refers to
the foreign policy strategy of using incentives (access to capital
markets) and penalties (varied types of sanctions) as tools of coercive
diplomacy. The [multiple wars agains Iran represent a model example of
the **weaponization of finance, the weaponization of information and the
weaponization of trade**.]{.underline} Under the Presidency of Barack
Obama,Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, noted that the weaponization of
finance offers to the US "a new battlefield...one that enables \[the
US\] to go after those who wish \[the US\] harm without putting \[US\]
troops in harm's way or using lethal force." Instead of fighting
countries militarily, the US can now "cripple them financially. The
Obama administration had retreated from a full scale weaponization of
finance with Iran by signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA ) with Iran in 2015. Under the terms of this agreement in Vienna
on 14 July 2015 between Iran, the P5+1 (the five permanent members of
the United Nations Security Council---China, France, Russia, United
Kingdom, United States---plus Germany),\[a\] and the European Union, it
was agreed that Iran would accept the P5+1 would ensure that Iran did
not develop nuclear weapons. Both Saudi Arabia and Israel had opposed
this agreement. When Donald Tromp became President of the United States,
his administration renounced the JCPOA in 2018 and then signed an
executive order reimposing sanctions on any foreign company that
continues to do business with Iran. The order gave companies 90-day or
180-day grace periods to extract themselves from existing Iranian
contacts or face punitive US measures. Those NATO partners of the USA
who signed the JCPOA refused to accept the sanctions imposed on Iran and
in 2019 agreed to create a special purpose vehicle to manage their trade
with Iran. Britain, Germany and France rolled out INSTEX in February
2019 as one way to break the weaponization of Finance by the USA but in
the cat and mouse game of economic warfare, the Foreign Ministers of
Europe have not yet been transparent on the full mandate of the special
purpose vehicle. These developments mirror the weaponization of trade
\[19\] and finance within NATO and the problems of inter imperialist
rivalry in West Asia. The threats against the countries that created a
special purpose vehicle (SPV) to help facilitate trade with Iran must be
taken very seriously, especially in the context of the political
insecurity generated by BREXIT. This period reminds the world that of
the depression when trade wars and currency wars eventually fueled open
fighting in World War II. Finance as warfare [Since the global financial
crisis of 2008-2009, there have been efforts by countries holding US
debt to limit their exposure to the dollar. In 2009, the Russians and
the Chinese worked to establish]{.underline} an alternative
international institution involving Brazil, Russia, India and China,
later including South Africa and called [BRICS]{.underline}. Within the
context of BRICS, the Chinese set about a slow process to
internationalize its currency, the RMB and undertook currency swaps to
avoid the US dollar. After failing to negotiate successfully within the
Bretton Woods institution for an increase of its drawing rights
commensurate with its volume of international trade, the Chinese
embarked on major economic and financial ventures under the banner of
One Belt One Road and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. When the
AIIB was launched in 2015 with 57 countries, the former Treasury
Secretary of the US, Lawrence Summers noted that the launch of the AIIB
was a turning point and 'the creation of the AIIB will undermine the
leadership role the U.S. has long enjoyed in global finance.' Both
Russia and China intensified their swap trading efforts and Russia
settled its crude sales to China. "In March 2018 news broke that Beijing
is planning a pilot project for the second half of the year to pay for
imported crude oil with renminbi instead of dollars. The two countries
allegedly selected for the pilot are Russia and Angola, with rumors that
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates may become involved. If this
venture is successful, it will act as a spur to similar schemes for
other imports and primary products." China was joining the leaders of
Europe and the countries in Asia and West Asia who were calling for a
multi-currency financial system. Many progressive economists noted that
it was not a matter if more countries would flee the dollar, but when.
One economist writing from Singapore wrote, "the emergence of a
multicurrency or multi-asset international payments system will take
time. It doesn't portend a collapse of the global payments system, but
does point to a redistribution of global wealth. The seigniorage
harvested by the US as the world's banker will gradually fall, narrowing
the room for maneuver in US economic policy, which for the last 70 years
has had the greatest influence on markets globally. As the power of the
dollar wanes, the US will be pressured to adjust to a world economy
vastly changed since 1945." \[20\] The German financial leaders along
with France were maneuvering to speed this change with the establishment
of the special purpose vehicle to continue trading with Iran. At this
time of writing the specific details of the specific purpose vehicle
called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) is still
being worked out, but the statements of former Ambassador Nicholas Burns
before Congress on March 26 made it clear that the Foreign Policy
establishment in the USA will not retreat from the weaponization of
Finance, especially since INSTEX allows members of NATO to continue
trading and financial arrangements with Iran, China and Russia. In so
far as Global NATO is serving the task of defending the dollar, the
extent to which China has created an alternative clearing system in the
Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) will be seen as another
blow to US financial hegemony. Although in its first rollout of the CIPS
system, the Chinese went to great length that it would cooperate with
the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)
system, the current US intelligence war against the Chinese telecom firm
Huawei point to the integration between Finance, information warfare and
cyberwarfare. \[21\] In the book, The Perfect Weapon, David Sanger
discussed the debates within this highest levels of US intelligence and
the Federal Reserve of whether the USA should use its Federal Reserve
and cyber warfare to backdoor into the Russian Central Bank to make
money disappear. It is in this context where one can note in the
planning of NATO strengthening the cyber capabilities is at the top of
the Agenda. The Harvard study emphasized the importance of winning the
Technology Battle in the Digital Age. [The convergence of cyberwarfare,
economic warfare and information warfare is being taken to new levels
under the current administration with its wide ranging sanctions against
countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.]{.underline}
Traditional books on NATO had surveyed the integration of diplomacy,
sanctions and weapons procurement, but [the new push of the USA in
formulating its position of unrivalled dominance is turning out to be
another front for defending the dollar. In a world where the USA had
imposed sanctions on Cuba, Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, Turkey, North
Korea, Syria, Sudan along with individual sanctions against individuals
in Somalia, South Sudan, Libya, Ukraine and Zimbabwe, the logic of these
sanctions]{.underline} enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) of the US Treasury has [now clarified to]{.underline} the allies
of the USA in [NATO the importance finance was warfare.]{.underline} It
was the former Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew, who had warned that the
over use of sanctions could dull their effectiveness. His logic was
simple: Sanctions work because they cut targets off from dealing with
U.S. citizens and American financial institutions---a complete severance
from the world's largest economy and its most important financial
center. If Washington used this power idly, Lew suggested, it could
encourage countries to find partners outside of the United States, and
undermine sanctions' deterrent effect. [What Lew did not acknowledge was
**the relationship between the Treasury, Global NATO and the financial
wars**.]{.underline} Much of the scholarship on the printing of dollars
miss the way in which the infusion of capital in emerging economies
further enmesh these societies into the instability of the system.
Ultimately, the export of the oscillation of the US economy deepens
social and political challenges on the world and reinforces the
militarization of the international political economy. Michael Hudson
outlined three ways in which flooding of dollars through debt leverage
and QE supported the military: (1) the surplus dollars pouring into the
rest of the world for yet further financial speculation and corporate
takeovers; (2) the fact that central banks are obliged to recycle these
dollar inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bonds to finance the federal U.S.
budget deficit; and most important (but most suppressed in the U.S.
media, (3) the military character of the U.S. payments deficit and the
domestic federal budget deficit. He continued, "Strange as it may seem
and irrational as it would be in a more logical system of world
diplomacy the "dollar glut" is what finances America's global military
build-up. It forces foreign central banks to bear the costs of America's
expanding military empire effective "taxation without representation."
Keeping international reserves in "dollars" means recycling their dollar
inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bills U.S. government debt issued largely
to finance the military." After the financial crisis in Europe,
Quantitative Easing was extended to the Eurozone and Japan, but in the
continuing re alignment, of global capitalism, US capital is working
hard to decapitate Russia and China as opponents of Global NATO. [The
currency wars and weaponization of finance is now accompanied by the
weaponization of trade and the weaponization of
information.]{.underline} Sanger's The Perfect Weapon War, Sabotage, and
Fear in the Cyber Agehas opened one window into how [**full spectrum
dominance** and the militarization of space is now linked to the
**weaponization of information and cognitive hacking**. We now have new
terms of warfare, terms such as "fake news", "disinformation,"
"weaponized information," "post-truth" and "alternative
facts."]{.underline} Weaponized information (WI) [defines a new method
messaging and dissemination of content that contains falsehoods, facts
taken out of context and pieces of truth strategically released, in an
attempt **to manipulate knowledge and beliefs**.]{.underline} The NATO
destruction of Libya was one clear example of how falsehoods were
refined to lull workers in Europe to support the destruction of Libya
The weaponization of Finance and the Destruction of Libya [Not enough is
being done to expose the real role of Global NATO and the role of so
called humanitarian operatives in ensuring that humanitarian
interventions become a force multiplier.]{.underline} Currently, many
countries of the EU collaborate with France in the North African region
in the fabrication of terror to ensure the deployment of the US Africa
Command and French forces in Africa. [In Western Europe, NATO has been
very successful in ensuring confusion, demoralization,]{.underline}
paralysis, [and apathy in relation to western imperialism in
Africa.]{.underline} African scholars and progressives are very clear
that while calling for the dismantling of NATO there must be a call for
the EURO to break from the CFA franc zone. Nicolas Sarkozy was very
clear that the intervention in Libya was to save the Euro. Africans
cannot have a Newtonian view of the struggle against imperialism to
assure those from the European left who want solidarity with Africans
while supporting French imperialism in Africa. Global NATO and French
machinations are involved in a delicate dance and there is silence from
the left in the EU when it comes to Europe's 4000 km strategic radius
that covers the entire area of West Africa, North Africa and down
through East Africa to Somalia. It is beyond this commentary to
delineate the ways in which German scholars, religious organizations,
German foundations and non-governmental organizations are now implicated
in the criminal acts of France in Africa, especially the war on terror.
It is the task of the progressive movement to penetrate the areas of
cooperation and conflict between European capitalists and Wall Street so
that European workers do not continue to complicity support
'humanitarian interventions.' [When 200 African scholars wrote the open
letter on the impending crime against the peoples of Libya, there has
been and continue to be **silence on the part of the left in Europe and
the United States**.]{.underline} Barack Obama had described the
intervention in Libya as a mistake and the British Parliamentary
Committee outlined how the Libyan intervention had been based on lies.
Obama may have considered the intervention a mistake, but his
understanding of the process did not reveal how Goldman Sachs was
thoroughly implicated the destruction of Libya. The case in the London
High Court of the Libyan Investment Authority vs Goldman Sachs brought
out revealing evidence of how [firms such as Goldman Sachs and others
involved in the financialization of the energy markets sought to
mobilize the resources of oil rich states]{.underline} with Sovereign
Wealth Funds [to keep alive the]{.underline} private equity, hedge funds
and structured derivatives [markets of the global capitalist
economy.]{.underline} Most societies and peoples in the world want these
banks to be brought under control. But Goldman Sachs benefitted in the
ruling because in 2014, two and a half years after the case was brought
before the High Court, there was a war in Libya and there was no
government therefore one could not represent the Libyan Investment
Authority in this arena. We see therefore that the financial
institutions are direct beneficiaries of the warfare that is going on in
Libya. When the United Nations passed Resolution 1970 and resolution
1973 in 2011, those who had signed these resolutions did not understand
then that the resolution was for regime in Libya.\[22\] The current
fighting in Libya remains one of the most inglorious aspects of the 70
year history of NATO but there is silence among those celebrating 70
years of NATO. \[23\] [Since the writings on Finance capital over a
century ago by]{.underline} Rudolph Hilferding, Vladimir
[Lenin,]{.underline} Rosa [Luxemburg, and]{.underline} Nikolai [Bukharin
the role of finance in the international system has grown beyond the
parameters outlined by those who linked finance capital to modern
imperialism]{.underline}.\[24\] After the collapse of the dollar/gold
system of 1944 **[the financial industry of the West has become the axis
on which international capitalism spins]{.underline}**.

[Capitalism is best understood as a]{.underline} [**competitive

**[exploitation]{.underline}** [of workers' labor power and the private

[designates as a value-generating good or service **anything** that

market**]{.underline} [are]{.underline} **[excluded]{.underline}** [in
this form of valuation and are treated as mere negative "externalities,"
unrelated to the capitalist economy]{.underline} itself---whether in
terms of the shortening and degradation of human life or the destruction
of the natural environment. As environmental economist K. William Kapp
stated, "capitalism must be regarded as an economy of unpaid costs."42

[We have now reached a point]{.underline} in the twenty-first century
[in which the]{.underline} **[externalities]{.underline}** [of
this]{.underline} [**irrational system**, such as the costs

I would argue that within the base building movement, there is a move
towards party organizing, but this trend has not always been explicitly
theorized or forwarded within the movement. My goal in this essay is to
argue that [base building and dual power strategy can be best forwarded
through party organizing, and that party organizing can allow this
emerging movement to solidify into a powerful revolutionary socialist
tendency in the United States.]{.underline} One of the crucial insights
of the base building movement is that [the current state of the left in
the United States is one in which revolution is not currently
possible.]{.underline} There exists very little popular support for
socialist politics. A century of anticommunist propaganda has been
extremely effective in convincing even the most oppressed and
marginalized that communism has nothing to offer them. [The base
building emphasis on dual power responds directly to this insight. By
building institutions which can meet people's needs, we are able to
concretely demonstrate that communists can offer the oppressed relief
from the horrific conditions of capitalism.]{.underline} Base building
strategy recognizes that actually doing the work to serve the people
does infinitely more to create a socialist base of popular support than
electing democratic socialist candidates or holding endless political
education classes can ever hope to do. Dual power is about proving that
we have something to offer the oppressed. The question, of course,
remains: once we have built a base of popular support, what do we do
next? [If it turns out that establishing socialist institutions to meet
people's needs does in fact create sympathy towards the cause of
communism, how can we mobilize that base?]{.underline} Put simply: **[in
order to mobilize the base which base builders hope to create, we need
to have already done the work of building a communist
party.]{.underline}** [It is not enough to simply meet peoples needs.
Rather, we must build the institutions of dual power in the name of
communism.]{.underline} [We must refuse covert front organizing and
instead have a public face as a communist party.]{.underline} When we
build tenants unions, serve the people programs, and other dual power
projects, we must make it clear that we are organizing as communists,
unified around a party, and are not content simply with establishing
endless dual power organizations. [We must be clear that our strategy is
revolutionary and in order to make this clear we must adopt party
organizing. By "party organizing" I mean an organizational strategy
which adopts the party model. Such organizing focuses on building a
party whose membership is formally unified around a party line
determined by democratic centralist decision making.]{.underline} [The
party model creates internal methods for **holding party members
accountable**, unifying party member action around democratically
determined goals, and for educating party members in communist theory
and praxis.]{.underline} A communist organization utilizing the party
model works to build dual power institutions while simultaneously
educating the communities they hope to serve. [Organizations which adopt
the party model focus on propagandizing around the need for
revolutionary socialism. They function as the forefront of political
organizing, empowering local communities to theorize their liberation
through communist theory while organizing communities to literally fight
for their liberation.]{.underline} A party is not simply a group of
individuals doing work together, but is a formal organization unified in
its fight against capitalism. Party organizing has much to offer the
base building movement. By working in a unified party, base builders can
ensure that local struggles are tied to and informed by a unified
national and international strategy. While the most horrific
manifestations of capitalism take on particular and unique form at the
local level, we need to remember that [our struggle is against a
material base which functions not only at the national but at the
international level. The formal structures provided by a democratic
centralist party model allow individual locals to have a voice in open
debate, but also allow for a unified strategy to emerge from democratic
consensus.]{.underline} Furthermore, **[party organizing allows for
local organizations and individual organizers to be held accountable for
their actions.]{.underline}** [It allows criticism to function not as
one independent group criticizing another independent group, but rather
as comrades with a formal organizational unity working together to
sharpen each others strategies and to help correct chauvinist ideas and
actions.]{.underline} In the context of the socialist movement within
the United States, such [accountability is crucial.]{.underline} [As a
movement which operates within a settler colonial society, imperialist
and colonial ideal frequently infect leftist organizing. Creating formal
unity and party procedure for dealing with and correcting these ideas
allows us to address these consistent problems within American socialist
organizing.]{.underline} Having a formal party which unifies the various
dual power projects being undertaken at the local level also allows for
base builders to not simply meet peoples needs, but to pull them into
the membership of the party as organizers themselves. The party model
creates a means for sustained growth to occur by unifying organizers in
a manner that allows for skills, strategies, and ideas to be shared with
newer organizers. It also allows community members who have been served
by dual power projects to take an active role in organizing by becoming
party members and participating in the continued growth of base building
strategy. It ensures that there are formal processes for educating
communities in communist theory and praxis, and also enables them to act
and organize in accordance with their own local conditions. We also must
recognize that the current state of the base building movement precludes
the possibility of such a national unified party in the present moment.
Since base building strategy is being undertaken in a number of already
established organizations, it is not likely that base builders would
abandon these organizations in favor of founding a unified party.
Additionally, it would not be strategic to immediately undertake such
complete unification because it would mean abandoning the organizational
contexts in which concrete gains are already being made and in which
growth is currently occurring. What is important for base builders to
focus on in the current moment is building dual power on a local level
alongside building a national movement. This means aspiring towards the
possibility of a unified party, while pursuing continued local growth.
The movement within the Marxist Center network towards some form of
unification is positive step in the right direction. The independent
party emphasis within the Refoundation caucus should also be recognized
as a positive approach. It is important for base builders to continue to
explore the possibility of unification, and to maintain unification
through a party model as a long term goal. In the meantime, [individual
base building organizations ought to adopt party models for their local
organizing. Local organizations ought to be building dual power
alongside recruitment into their organizations, education of community
members in communist theory and praxis, and the establishment of armed
and **militant party cadres** capable of defending dual power
institutions from state terror.]{.underline} Dual power institutions
must be unified openly and transparently around these organizations in
order for them to operate as more than "red charities." Serving the
people means meeting their material needs while also educating and
propagandizing. It means radicalizing, recruiting, and organizing. [The
party model remains the most useful method for achieving these
ends.]{.underline} The use of the party model by local organizations
allows base builders to gain popular support, and most importantly, to
mobilize their base of popular support towards revolutionary ends, not
simply towards the construction of a parallel economy which exists as an
end in and of itself. [It is my hope that we will see future unification
of the various local base building organizations into a national
party,]{.underline} but in the meantime we must push for party
organizing at the local level. If local organizations adopt party
organizing, [it ought to become clear that]{.underline} **[a unified
national party will have to be the long term goal of the base building
movement.]{.underline}** Many of the already existing organizations
within the base building movement already operate according to these
principles. I do not mean to suggest otherwise. Rather, my hope is to
suggest that we ought to be explicit about the need for party organizing
and emphasize the relationship between dual power and the party model.
Doing so will make it clear that the base building movement is not
pursuing a cooperative economy alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a
revolutionary socialist strategy capable of fighting capitalism. The
long term details of base building and dual power organizing will arise
organically in response to the conditions the movement finds itself
operating within. [I hope that I have put forward a useful contribution
to the discussion about base building organizing, and have demonstrated
the need for party organizing in order to ensure that the base building
tendency maintains a revolutionary orientation.]{.underline} The finer
details of revolutionary strategy will be worked out over time and are
not a good subject for public discussion. I strongly believe party
organizing offers the best path for ensuring that such strategy will
succeed. My goal here is not to dictate the only possible path forward
but to open a conversation about how the base building movement will
organize as it transitions from a loose network of individual
organizations into a unified socialist tendency. These discussions and
debates will be crucial to ensuring that this rapidly growing movement
can succeed.

### NEG\-\--Cap K\-\--Impact\-\--War (General)

#### Global reach of West has resulted in the appearance of interimperial and total warfare which defines the modern era

Dina **Gusejnova '18**, is Lecturer in Modern History at the University
of Sheffeld, "1 Introduction", Cosmopolitanism in Conflict, Palgrave
McMillian, 2018, accessed via PDF -- email caitlinp96@gmail.com for a
copy

The first type of context within which we place the rise of global
consciousness and a cosmopolitan agenda is that of war. The ideas of
Emer de Vattel and even of Carl von Clausewitz may not seem as far
removed from those of Immanuel Kant as the twenty-first century
theorists of cosmopolitanism would have it, especially considering, as
Reinhart Koselleck had once remarked, that Kant's Perpetual Peace was in
fact an echo of the Treaty of Basel (1795), one of several separate
peace treaties signed during the French Revolutionary Wars.24 [From the
War of the Spanish Succession, the Seven Years' War and the War of
American Independence in the eighteenth century, to the Napoleonic and
later the extraEuropean colonial wars in the nineteenth, followed by the
two World Wars and the Cold War in the twentieth century, each moment in
the intellectual development of cosmopolitan thought can be linked to a
series of increasingly global conflicts which also had profound
repercussions for the political imagination]{.underline}. **[The Seven
Years' War marks the conceptual start of the volume because this
conflict had made clear that European interimperial conflicts could no
longer be viewed from one or two sides, as confrontations between
national realms, but demanded a global perspective both from their
participants, and from subsequent interpreters]{.underline}**. What
initially was a conflict between Britain and France escalated into a war
of global proportions in which previous loyalties were caught in the
vortex of two international coalitions involving most of the great
powers, with Prussia on the British and Austria, Russia and Spain on the
French side, and reaching colonies and dominions from Bengal to Quebec.
**[The new realities of interimperial conflict were a product of global
colonial interests, along with a rise in regional aspirations to
sovereignty]{.underline}**. **[In the twentieth century, concepts of
warfare took the form of 'total war' in the age of
Goebbels]{.underline}**. **[While new forms of warfare made the
separation between military and civilian combatants and targets less
significant, the Cold War challenged the very distinction between
wartime and peacetime through a growing expansion of conflict into the
sphere of culture, or]{.underline}** what Joseph Nye has termed '**[soft
power]{.underline}**'.25 '[The connection between cosmopolitanism and
war, we may be tempted to think, is merely sequential,]{.underline}'
Stephen Conway (Chap. 1) points out in his contribution on transnational
aspects of eighteenthcentury European warfare. [But looking at the
practices of conducting war and peace]{.underline} in the War of the
Spanish (1702--1713), Polish (1733--1738), Austrian (1740--1748) and
Bavarian (1778--1779) succession, and the Napoleonic wars, [his chapter
shows how cosmopolitan ideas not only could, but did arise from within
these incidents in the form of social practices, changes in etiquette
and reflections on solidarity]{.underline}. The **[increasingly global
deployment of military officers and mercenaries, which became prominent
in eighteenth-century European wars, changed the relationship of people
to places, as well as stretching the boundaries between 'reason of
state' arguments and imperialist expansion.]{.underline}**26 **[At the
same time, growing commercial connections and information networks
increasingly invited societies to think of global aspirations as a
social reality rather than as a utopian aspiration, even though these
connections remained unevenly spread across the globe]{.underline}**.27
Four areas are examined: [first, the alliance systems that brought
different governments and armed forces into cooperation; second, the
supply and finance of armies and navies]{.underline}, which often relied
on complex transnational networks; [third, the composition of supposedly
national armies; and finally the legal framework that sought to define
the boundaries of acceptable behaviour in war and the values that
underpinned its conduct]{.underline}. In this new light, the
cosmopolitan dimensions of war can be uncovered, focusing on sympathy
for the sufferings of others---outside one's own local, national or
ethnic community---among those engaged in the fighting.

#### Capitalism is the [root cause of war]{.underline}.

**Hathaway \'15** \[William; 3/4/15; adjunct professor of American
studies at the University of Oldenburg in Germany; \"The root cause of
war is oligarchic capitalism,\"
https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/root-cause-war-oligarchic-capitalism/\]

[**Capitalism** is **always at war**. The **violence**, though, is often
**abstract**: forcing us either to accept low-paying, **exhausting
jobs** or **starve**; denying us adequate **healthcare**, **education**
and **economic security**; convincing us that human beings are basically
isolated, autonomous units seeking self gratification. But when this
**doesn\'t suffice** to keep their **profits** growing, the **violence
becomes physical**]{.underline}, the cannons roar, [and the elite
rallies us to war]{.underline} to defend \"our\" country and destroy the
fiendish enemy. [Motivating us to **kill** and **die** for them requires
a massive **propaganda campaign** - America is under
attack!]{.underline} - which we confront whenever we turn on their
media.

No, they\'re not. They\'re just human beings serving an inhuman system.
[Capitalism is **inherently predatory**. It demands **aggressive
growth**. It either **dominates** or **goes under**. This drive for
domination is the **root cause of war**, and until we **eliminate it**,

requires a **global struggle** to **bring down oligarchic capitalism**

roots of the environment crisis,\"

[**Climate change** is only **one aspect** of the problem. Everywhere we
look, the **natural systems** that maintain our planet in its
**habitable state** are rapidly **deteriorating**. Can we survive the
**destruction** of the tropical **rain forests** of the **Amazon** --
the **lungs of Earth**? Can we survive the **spread** of **dead
zones**]{.underline} -- areas too low in oxygen to sustain life --
[across our **oceans**? Can we make do without the **bees** and other
**insects** we]{.underline} currently [depend on to **pollinate** our
**crops**?]{.underline}

[Perhaps the **scariest thing**]{.underline} about the situation [isn't
the **vast scale** of breakdown in natural systems but the fact that
those entrusted with the **leadership** of our society appear determined
to **hasten us to our doom**]{.underline}. Instead of listening to the
advice of the scientists, firefighters, land managers and others who've
been sounding the alarm about climate change for decades, Scott Morrison
and Co. parrot propaganda points from the Murdoch press. Instead of
agreeing, finally, to contribute more to global efforts to reduce carbon
emissions, they double down on the expansion of Australia's booming coal
and gas industries, attempting all the while to distract the public with
fairy tales about greenies preventing back-burning and the fires just
being part of Australia's natural cycle.

Elsewhere in the world, the picture is the same. [Decades of global
**climate negotiations** have gone **nowhere**. Despite the increasingly
urgent warnings of scientists, **emissions continue to
rise**]{.underline}. And with the likes of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin
and Jair Bolsonaro in charge of some of the world's biggest economies,
the prospects for a major shift occurring soon appear terrifyingly dim.

Where did it all go wrong? The answer is suggested by the increasingly
popular slogan System change, not climate change. Morrison, Trump and
their fellow [fossil fuel enthusiasts act not simply in accordance with
their personal whims]{.underline} and desires [but as the **conscious
servants** of a system: **capitalism**. Proponents of capitalism talk as
if it's the **natural form** of human society]{.underline} -- something
that has existed since the dawn of time. [The reality,]{.underline}
however, [is that the age of capitalism spans only the past two to three
centuries.]{.underline} For the vast majority of our 200-300,000 year
history, humans lived in societies, like those of the Indigenous
inhabitants of Australia prior to invasion, characterized by collective
decision making and sharing of resources, not the system of private
property and the endless competitive scramble for individual gain that
define the world today.

If the capitalist system was most befitting of our human nature, you
would expect its emergence to have been embraced by all whose lives were
transformed by it. But [the birth of capitalism]{.underline} in the 17th
and 18th centuries [was an extremely **violent process** that was
**strongly resisted** from the start.]{.underline} As Karl Marx put it
in Capital: "The discovery of gold and silver in America, the
extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal
population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East
Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting
of black-skins, signaled the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist
production." Capital came into the world, he wrote, "dripping from head
to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt."

[Since the earliest days of human existence, we have had a significant
impact on the environment]{.underline}. Scientists believe, for
instance, that hunting, along with the use of fire and other land
management techniques employed by Australia's Indigenous population,
contributed to the extinction of the continent's megafauna.
Deforestation was a major problem in ancient Greece and the Roman
Empire. Air pollution from the burning of wood and coal was an issue in
London as early as the 12th and 13th centuries. [All this, however, was
on a **minuscule scale** compared to the **devastation** of the past
**200 years**, and particularly]{.underline} in the period [after World
War Two -- the era in which **capitalism came to dominate** every
corner]{.underline} of the globe.

In 1950, global carbon emissions totaled 5.28 billion tonnes. By 2017,
they were 36.15 billion tonnes. According to the World Wildlife Fund's
Living Planet Report 2018, [the **total population** of **mammals**,
**birds**, **fish** and **reptiles** has **declined by 60 percent**
since 1970. Every year, the rate of **extinctions** rises,]{.underline}
and scientists estimate that [a million animal and plant species may go
extinct over the coming decades]{.underline}. According to a 2016 report
by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the production of plastic has risen
20-fold since 1964 and is expected to double again in the next 20 years
and quadruple by 2050. Only around 5 percent of plastic ends up being
recycled. If current trends continue, the report predicts, [by 2050
there will, by weight, be **more plastic** in the world's oceans **than
fish**]{.underline}.

No one of these gloomy metrics, considered alone, can capture the depths
of the crisis we face. [In only 200 years]{.underline} of existence,
[capitalism has brought us to the brink of such a **calamitous
breakdown** in the world's natural systems that **our entire
civilization is now under threat**]{.underline}.

[Among Marx's most evocative metaphors for]{.underline} the operation of
[capital is his description of it as "dead labor, that, vampire-like,
only lives by sucking living labor,]{.underline} and lives the more, the
more labor it sucks". It's not only "living labor," however, that
sustains the vampire of capital, [but also the **natural inputs** of the
**productive process** -- the **raw materials** that labor works up into
the products that capitalists sell on]{.underline} the market for their
coveted profits.

[What makes capitalism **uniquely destructive** in
comparison]{.underline} to previous systems [is the **rupture** of the
**connection** between the main drivers of **economic life** and the
**natural world** that sustains us]{.underline}. A capitalist may own a
significant amount of land. But unlike the feudal lords of the Middle
Ages, their wealth isn't tied to the piece of land that they own. [If a
capitalist **destroys** their land]{.underline} -- say by digging up all
the coal or oil it contains, poisoning it with chemicals or exhausting
the fertility of the soil through over-farming -- [they can simply take
the **profits** they've generated from it and **buy more** land
elsewhere]{.underline}.

The vampire metaphor is powerful precisely because it speaks to this
fundamental rift between the lifeblood of capitalism -- profit -- and
society's underlying life systems, including labor and the natural
environment, that are the ultimate source of all wealth. Rolling Stone
contributor Matt Taibbi's description of investment bank Goldman Sachs
as "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity,
relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like
money", can be extended to the whole capitalist class. [The
environmental (or other) **consequences** of their activities don't give
them much **pause** for concern as long as they're **making
money**]{.underline}.

[The wealth of the capitalist ruling class]{.underline} of today [is so
immense that even the **existential threat** posed by **climate change**
won't shake them into action]{.underline}. According to Oxfam, the
combined wealth of the world's 2,153 billionaires exceeds that of the
poorest 4.6 billion people, who make up 60 percent of the global
population. [Catastrophic events]{.underline} like the Australian bush
fires [are unlikely to faze them]{.underline} -- in contrast to the mass
of ordinary people impacted by the fires, they can easily buy their way
to safety.

[The ruling class's **lack of concern** for the **environment** is
reinforced by the **competitive nature** of the system. Each individual
capitalist must keep their **costs low** and their **profits high** to
stay ahead of their rivals. The main way]{.underline} they do this [is
by keeping workers' **wages down**. But if they can save money by not
dealing with the **environmental costs** of their operations, they'll do
that too]{.underline}.

[The capitalist class gains immense savings from treating
**environmental destruction** as an "externality" that they can pass on
to society]{.underline}. The International Monetary Fund calculated that
global subsidies to fossil fuel companies amount to US\$5.2 trillion a
year, approximately 6.4 percent of world GDP. Most subsidies relate to
the cost of dealing with the destructive consequences of all the carbon
emissions produced by burning fossil fuels. This includes the impacts of
climate change, along with the costs of health care associated with air
pollution and so on.

[You might wonder why governments are willing to let]{.underline} fossil
fuel companies and other [**destructive industries** get away with this.
The answer lies in the **role** of the **capitalist state**. We're
taught that it is a neutral body]{.underline} that mediates between the
conflicting interests of different social layers and guides society in
the collective interest. [The state, however, has **never been
neutral**. Modern **capitalist states** emerged in **conjunction** with
the rise of the **capitalist class** as the dominant economic power in
society, and they've always]{.underline}, as Marx put it, [been "a
**committee** for managing the **common affairs** of the **whole
bourgeoisie**]{.underline}."

[The role of the capitalist state]{.underline}, in other words, [is to
**protect** and **advance** the interests of **big business** and the
**rich**, rather than the mass of the population who **suffer the
consequences** of their **environmentally destructive**
practices]{.underline}. And again, this dynamic is reinforced by
competition on an international scale. Each national state defends the
interests of its capitalist class against those of their foreign rivals.
This involves both maintaining good business conditions (e.g. low wages
and a lack of environmental and other regulations) at home and
projecting power externally, through diplomatic and military means, to
ensure access to resources and markets around the world.

[The **destructive consequences** of these dynamics can be seen in
capitalism's almost uninterrupted **history of war**]{.underline}. And
they also help explain the continuing failure of global efforts to
secure agreement on any serious action to reduce carbon emissions or
address other major environmental issues. [Sacrificing **short term
profits** in the name of **long term sustainability** goes against the
DNA of the capitalist nation state]{.underline}. This is particularly
clear in the case of Australia, one of the world's most fossil
fuel-dependent nations. Neither the Liberals nor Labor are prepared to
forgo the tens of billions in profits that flow from coal and gas
exports. The strength of the fossil fuel industry is just too important
to Australia's status as a major regional power.

We're in a battle for our lives. [The **entire future** of the **human
experiment**]{.underline} -- so utterly miraculous and so terrifyingly
fragile -- [depends on what we do in the **coming years**]{.underline}
and decades. As Russian Marxist Nikolai Bukharin, writing a few years
after the revolution of 1917, put it: "[No system, including that of
human society, can exist in empty space; it is surrounded by an
'environment,' on which all its conditions ultimately depend. If **human
society** is not **adapted** to its environment, it is not meant for
this world; all its culture will **inevitably pass away**; society
itself will be **reduced to dust**]{.underline}."

This mainstream vision of how to achieve a sustainable world is coherent
in theory, at best, but demonstrably it does not reflect empirical
reality (see Alexander, 2014). [Although]{.underline} many [economies
around the world are]{.underline} indeed [getting better at producing

as 'relative decoupling'), [overall ecological impact is]{.underline}
nevertheless still [increasing, because]{.underline} every year
[increasing numbers of commodities are being produced, exchanged, and

of the **'Jevons paradox'**]{.underline} that **[permeates market

paradox, so-called, because **[a per unit reduction]{.underline}** in

the **[increasing amounts of commodities]{.underline}** that are

this is that **technology and efficiency improvements are not going to
solve the ecological crisis**]{.underline}, as their most optimistic
advocates and popular consciousness seem to assume they can (Lovins,
1998) -- at least, not [unless]{.underline} the [highly developed

Efficiency without sufficiency is lost.

#### Communism spurs [more]{.underline} and [better]{.underline} innovation than capitalism -- all "innovation" under capital has been due to [restricting]{.underline} corporate decision-making, not the free market

Tony **Smith '15**, is a professor of philosophy at Iowa State
University and the author of Technology and Capital in the Age of Lean
Production., "Red Innovation", Jacobin, 3/31/15,
https://jacobinmag.com/2015/03/socialism-innovation-capitalism-smith

[The technological dynamism of capitalism has always been a powerful
argument in its defense]{.underline}. **[But one of its secrets is that
at the heart of this change we find neither bold entrepreneurs, venture
capitalists, nor established firms.]{.underline}**

**[Investments pushing the frontiers of scientific knowledge are just
too risky]{.underline}**. The advances sought may not be forthcoming.
Those that do occur may not ever be commercially viable. **[Any
potentially profitable results that do arise may take decades to make
any money. And when they finally do, there are no guarantees initial
investors will appropriate most of the resulting
windfall]{.underline}**.

**[There is]{.underline}**, accordingly, **[a powerful tendency for
private capital to systematically underinvest in long-term research and
development]{.underline}**. **[Despite popular perceptions that private
entrepreneurs drive technological innovation, the leading regions of the
global economy do not leave the most important stages of technological
change to private investors]{.underline}**. [These costs are
socialized]{.underline}.

In the quarter-century after World War II, the high profits garnered by
American corporations due to their exceptional place in the world market
allowed corporate labs to engage in "blue-skies research" projects. But
even then**[, public funding accounted for roughly two-thirds of all
research and development expenditures in the United States, creating the
foundations for the high-tech sectors of today.]{.underline}**

With the rise of competition from Japanese and European capital in the
1970s, private-sector funding of research and development increased.
However, long-term projects were almost entirely abandoned in favor of
product development and applied-research projects promising commercial
advantages in the short-to-medium term.

[**Basic research continued to be funded by the government, like the
work in molecular biology that supported the move of agribusiness
companies into biotechnology.** The same was true for projects of
special interest to the Pentagon]{.underline} --- [the developments
associated with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, for
instance, which paved the way for modern global positioning
systems]{.underline} --- [and other government agencies]{.underline}.

**[But medium-to-long-term R&D in general was in great danger of falling
into a "valley of death" between basic research and immediate
development, with neither the government nor private capital providing
significant funding for it]{.underline}**.

[For all their rhetoric touting the "magic of the marketplace," those in
the Reagan administration recognized market failure when they saw it.
They began to offer federal and publicly funded university laboratories
various carrots and sticks to undertake long-term R&D for US
capital]{.underline}.

New programs were created to provide start-ups with resources to develop
innovations prior to the "proof of concept" required by venture
capitalists. Under Reagan, the Small Business Innovation Development Act
even mandated that federal agencies set aside a percentage of their R&D
budget to fund research by small firms. These and other forms of
public-private partnership have granted US capital enormous competitive
advantages in the world market.

It's no surprise that Apple's tremendously successful line of products
--- iPads, iPhones, and iPods --- incorporate twelve key innovations.
All twelve (central processing units, dynamic random-access memory,
hard-drive disks, liquid-crystal displays, batteries, digital single
processing, the Internet, the HTTP and HTML languages, cellular
networks, GPS system, and voice-user AI programs) were developed by
publicly funded research and development projects.

**[It hasn't been the dynamics of the market so much as active state
intervention that has fueled technological change.]{.underline}**

The Promised Golden Age

**[Technology is more than just a weapon for inter-capitalist
competition; it is a weapon in struggles between capital and
labor]{.underline}**. **[Technological changes that create unemployment,
de-skill the workforce, and enable one sector of the workforce to be
played against another shift the balance of power in capital's
favor]{.underline}**. Given this asymmetry, **[advances in productivity
that could reduce work time while expanding real wages lead instead to
forced layoffs, increasing stress for those still employed and eroding
real wages]{.underline}**.

[Two ongoing technological developments further strengthen the power of
capital. Advances in transportation and communication now enable
production and distribution chains to be extended across the globe,
allowing capital to implement "divide and conquer" strategies against
labor to an unprecedented extent]{.underline}.

Astounding new labor-saving machines are also becoming more and more
inexpensive. A recent exhaustive study of over seven hundred occupations
concluded that no less than 47 percent of employment in the United
States is at high risk of being automated within two decades. Anything
approaching this level of labor displacement will yield more misery, not
progress, for ordinary workers.

[But the lower cost and higher capacities of machines have also led to
change of a better sort]{.underline}. [As the prices of computer
hardware, software, and Internet connections have declined, many people
can now create new "knowledge products" without working for big
capitalists]{.underline}.

**[Multitudes across the globe now freely choose to contribute to
collective innovation projects of interest to them, outside the
relationship of capital and wage labor]{.underline}**. The resulting
products can now be distributed as unlimited free goods to anyone who
wishes to use them, rather than being scarce commodities sold for
profit.

**[It is beyond dispute that this new form of social labor has generated
innovations superior in quality and scale to the output of capitalist
firms]{.underline}**. These innovations also tend to be qualitatively
different.

**[While technological developments in capitalism primarily address the
wants and needs of those with disposable income, open-source projects
can mobilize creative energies to address areas capital systematically
neglects, such as developing seeds for poor farmers or medicines for
those without the money to buy existing medications]{.underline}**.
**[The potential of this new form of collective social labor to address
pressing social needs across the globe is historically
unprecedented.]{.underline}**

In order to flourish, however, open-source innovation requires free
access to existing knowledge goods[. Leading capital firms, hoping to
extend their ability to privately profit from publicly supported
research, have used their immense political power to extend the
intellectual property rights regime in scope and enforcement, severely
restricting the access open-source projects require]{.underline}.
Copyright, after all, was extended for twenty years at the turn of the
century, just as Internet access was starting to balloon.

**[Despite these barriers, the success of open-source projects shows
that intellectual-property rights are not required for
innovation]{.underline}**. Further evidence is provided by the fact that
most scientific and technological workers engaged in innovation are
forced to sign away intellectual property rights as a condition of
employment. **[These rights actually hamper advancement by raising the
cost of engaging in the production of new knowledge, and by diverting
funds to unproductive legal costs]{.underline}**.

The World is Flat?

**[Capitalism also hampers the ability of much of the world to
contribute to technological advancement]{.underline}**. **[Whole regions
of the global economy lack the wealth to support meaningful
innovation]{.underline}**. Today, **[only four countries spend over 3
percent of their GDP on research and development]{.underline}**; a mere
six others devote 2 percent or more.

[Capital in these advantaged regions has the opportunity to establish a
virtuous circle, free-riding on the extensive public investment
discussed above]{.underline}. [Privileged access to advanced R&D enables
capitalists to appropriate high returns on successful innovations; these
returns allow those companies to make effective use of technological
advances in the next cycle, setting the stage for future
profits]{.underline}.

**[At the same time, enterprises in poorer regions, lacking access to
high-level R&D, find themselves trapped in a vicious
cycle]{.underline}**. Their present inability to make significant
innovations that would enable them to compete successfully in world
markets undercuts their future prospects. Only a handful of countries
--- such as South Korea and Taiwan --- have ever been able to move
forward from this starting disadvantage.

[Global disparities in technological change alone do not explain why 1
percent of people in the world now own 48 percent of global wealth. But
they are a major part of the story; technological change is a weapon
that enables the privileged to maintain and extend their global
advantages over time]{.underline}.

Creative Non-Destruction

**[The destructive effects examined above are not necessary features of
technological change; they are necessary features of technological
change in capitalism. Overcoming them requires overcoming
capitalism]{.underline}**, even if we only have a provisional sense of
what that might mean.

[The pernicious tendencies associated with technological change in
capitalist workplaces are rooted in a structure where managers are
agents of the owners of the firm's assets, with a fiduciary duty to
further their private interests]{.underline}.

But a society's means of production are not goods for personal
consumption, like a toothbrush. The material reproduction of society is
an inherently public matter, as the technological development of
capitalism itself, resting on public funds, confirms. **[Capital
markets, where private claims to productive resources are bought and
sold, treat public power as if it were just another item for personal
use. They can, and should, be totally done away with]{.underline}**.

It should not come as a surprise that a [change of the dominant mode of
production]{.underline} of human society [takes place by a **clash** of
**brute forces**]{.underline}, of worldwide war. Limiting his attention
to the aspect of equality of men the anthropologist Walter Scheidel
describes in fascinating historical detail how [wars always preceded the
setup of large scale new organization of society]{.underline}, see
\[Scheidel, 2017\]. To which extent such a war again is on the agenda
today - contrary to the existence of DC - clearly is a question of
forecasting. The previous section of this chapter used a scenario
technique to sketch some contours of a possible third World War. These
scenarios are not independent, mixtures of them are to be expected, e.g.
a common strategy of a player in scenario 1 is to stir up national civil
war (scenario 2) in a satellite country of its opponent (e.g.
Yugoslavia); or to use the rhetoric of scenario 3 to support the fight
of national class struggle (scenario 2). But [will WW3 happen at
all?]{.underline}

[Not necessarily,]{.underline} but with a frightening high probability.
[Some **counterstrategies** already have been mentioned]{.underline}
along the discussion of the scenarios. [The **immediate
candidate**]{.underline}, of course, [is a **global peace
movement**]{.underline}. This movement already played a pivotal role in
ending the Vietnam War, being an incubator for the worldwide cultural
revolution of 1968. As the short life and the macroeconomic impotence30
of this rebellion showed, any movement with durable impact needs not
only roots in personal perceptions and feelings, it also needs a very
sophisticated and well-developed blueprint of the overall working of a
global democratic society. [A mode of production is a complicated
political economy entity, which needs a **complicated system design**.
Fortunately, the explosive **accumulation** of **human knowledge**, of
**science**, should]{.underline} be able to [provide just that -- if it
were not handcuffed by]{.underline} the singular tasks tailored by
[Disintegrating Capitalism. The next best counteraction]{.underline}
thus [is to **organize** the carriers of this knowledge]{.underline},
e.g. [scientists, in a **progressive global class**. Even if WW3
happens, chances are that a **restart is possible** and the
**blueprint** of a **better mode of production** is
**needed**]{.underline}. In this case Umberto Eco's vision of an
upcoming new Middle Ages31, with monasteries (today: universities?)
preserving and developing secret knowledge, might become reality.

### NEG\-\--Cap K\-\--Alt\-\--Solvency

#### **International organization and revolution is possible -- now is time to capitalize on energy**

**Tavan \'21** \[Luca; 3/7/21; writer for Red Flag; \"Worldwide
revolution is possible and necessary,\"
<https://redflag.org.au/article/worldwide-revolution-possible-and-necessary/>\]

From the moment [Marx and Engels urged **workers of the world** to
**unite** at the climax of the Communist Manifesto, the
goal]{.underline} of **[international revolution]{.underline}** has been
at the core of Marxist politics.

[International revolution isn't just a romantic dream, but an **urgent
necessity**. It's the **only means** by which **capitalism** can be
**permanently uprooted** and **replaced** with socialism. This is
because capitalism, unlike previous class societies, is a **globally
integrated** system]{.underline}. "For the first time in history", wrote
British Marxist Colin Barker of this phenomenon, "capitalism has created
a genuinely world society, where all our lives are entwined together in
a common history and a common fate".

[Capitalism has linked every nation in a **global chain of
production**]{.underline}. Take your mobile phone for example. It was
likely assembled in China, using computer chips manufactured in Taiwan,
powered by coal exported from Australia and produced with minerals mined
in the Democratic Republic of Congo according to specifications
developed in Europe or the United States. [No single country produces
all the things necessary to satisfy its population's needs, unlike the
various forms of society that came before capitalism]{.underline}, which
were mostly self-sufficient and organised around small local economies.

[Capitalism was established as a **world system** through immense
**robbery** and **violence**---from the international **slave
trade**]{.underline}, which fuelled the Industrial Revolution,
[to]{.underline} the [murderous **colonisation**]{.underline} of what is
now Australia. [That same violence is today used by **states** to
**defend** their **imperialist interests**, and discipline any
movements]{.underline} that get in their way. Movements that aspire to
national independence or that back left-wing reformist governments have
been demolished with the aid of the great capitalist powers countless
times in the past century, from the overthrow of the Allende government
in Chile in 1973 to the 2019 Bolivian coup.

Revolutionary movements that attempt to overturn the entire capitalist
system face a much more severe response. This was confirmed by the
defeat of the Russian Revolution. In 1917 workers, radicalised by years
of war and economic crisis, overthrew the tsarist regime and eventually
took power into their own hands. In response, the capitalist powers of
the world united to crush the workers' state, in alliance with
reactionaries who wanted to restore the tsarist regime. [Unless
revolutions can spread internationally and challenge the imperialist
powers that have an interest in destroying them, they will be
crushed.]{.underline}

A heroic effort by Russian workers and peasants fought off 16 foreign
invading armies, but at a great cost. The working class was decimated,
the factories were depopulated, and the radical working-class democracy
that had been built withered. The [isolation and poverty imposed on
Russia made building socialism an impossibility, and a new Stalinist
regime emerged]{.underline} that reversed most of the gains of the
revolution.

[Because Russian revolutionary socialists]{.underline} who pinned their
hopes on spreading revolution across the globe [were ultimately
defeated, their example is used by defenders of capitalism as a
**cautionary tale**]{.underline} today: [that a **worldwide revolution**
against the system is an **impossible dream**]{.underline}.

[But capitalism's **global nature** means that **revolts tend to
spread** across **national borders**. Workers today **share**
increasingly **similar experiences**: conditions of **work**, forms of
**consumption**, **lifestyles** and political **cultures**. And the
**global integration** of production serves to **transmit struggle**
from one country to another]{.underline}. In 1974, for instance,
[resistance to the brutal military dictatorship in Chile spread to East
Kilbride, Scotland, of all places]{.underline}. Workers at the Rolls
Royce factory there learned that the engines they were repairing were
being used by the Chilean air force to drop bombs on workers resisting
the coup. They downed tools and refused to work on the engines, keeping
them out of the hands of the military junta for four years.

[While nationalism still has a powerful hold]{.underline} on the
consciousness of many, [it's increasingly clear that the real **line of
polarisation** across the **globe** is between the **minority ruling
class** and the **majority working class**. And when **revolts** break
out in one part of the world, people can **identify with the causes and
motivations** of their struggles, and **draw comparisons** with their
own situation]{.underline}. "Languages remain different," observed UK
Marxist Chris Harman in 1992, "but [what they say is increasingly the
same]{.underline}". Harman's words ring true in every wave of political
radicalisation.

[1968 is remembered as a year of **global revolt**, when **millions** of
**workers**, **students** and **oppressed** people drew inspiration from
each other's movements. Activists in the **US**]{.underline} were
[radicalised by the heroic resistance of the **Vietnamese**
people]{.underline} to American imperialism. [**Irish** civil rights
activists emulated the militant politics of the Black
Panthers]{.underline}. When [students and workers united to launch a
massive general strike in **France**]{.underline} in May, [it taught
student radicals in **Australia** that they needed to link
up]{.underline} with the power of the organised working class in order
to win.

[The movements of 1968 **united people** across superficially very
**different societies**]{.underline}. For decades, Cold War common sense
had dictated that the greatest divide on the planet was between Western
liberal capitalism and Stalinist "Communism". But [in 1968, both sides
of the iron curtain **exploded in revolt**. The **triggers** for the
struggles may have been **different**, but they were all **responses**
to **similar** issues: **inequality**, **exploitation** and **war**,
imposed by monstrous **bureaucratic states**]{.underline}.

[In 2011, a]{.underline} poor [Tunisian street vendor set himself
alight]{.underline} to protest against police harassment. [Within days,
his act had inspired anti-government protests across the
country]{.underline}. Within weeks, the [protests escalated into a
**regional revolt** that challenged regimes across the **Arab world**.
One small act **tapped into resentment** against **inequality**,
**unemployment** and **state violence** that engulfed an entire region.
The **radical wave** spread even further: at a massive
demonstration]{.underline} against an anti-union bill [in the US city of
Madison, Wisconsin]{.underline}, a man held up a poster with a picture
of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak beside Republican Governor Scott
Walker. The caption read: "One dictator down. One to go". [The Arab
revolutions went on to **inspire** the **Occupy** movement, which spread
to more than 80 countries]{.underline}.

[Today, more than ever, **insurgent social movements** and working-class
**uprisings** are **spurring action** in other parts of the
world]{.underline}---from Hong Kong to Chile, from Lebanon to France.
One placard at a memorial for protesters murdered while resisting the
military coup in Myanmar took up Marx's incitement: "Workers of the
world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains".

[While the Russian Revolution is cynically held up by capitalist
ideologists]{.underline} as the ultimate argument against international
revolution, [it actually **proves the opposite**. It shows that the goal
is not only **necessary**, but also that it's **possible**. The news of
**workers seizing power** in Russia]{.underline}, overthrowing their
capitalist government [and declaring]{.underline} their [withdrawal from
WWI, created shock waves across the planet. Workers in **Germany** rose
in revolt a year later]{.underline}, ending the war for good and
building soviets, a form of radical working-class democracy inspired by
the Russian example. [This was followed by **uprisings** in **France**,
**Italy** and **Hungary**]{.underline}.

[The **revolutionary wave** spread further.]{.underline} A [classified
British government report]{.underline} from 1919 [noted a "very
**widespread feeling** among workers that thrones have become
anachronisms, and that the Soviet may be the **best form** of Government
for a democracy".]{.underline}

The rising tide of radicalism had an impact in Australia too.
Meatworkers in the Queensland city of Townsville donned red jumpers,
stormed the local police station to free jailed unionists, and placed
the city under workers' control. The editor of the conservative
Townsville Daily Bulletin lamented: "Townsville for the last year or so
has been developing Bolshevism \... the mob management of affairs in
this city, differs very little, from the Petrograd and Moscow brand".

[The Russian Bolsheviks]{.underline}, the revolutionary working-class
party that led the revolution to victory in 1917, [didn't just passively
wait for revolutions elsewhere. They **actively organised to spread the
revolt**]{.underline}. In 1919, [they established the **Communist
International**, an organisation for **debate**, **discussion** and
**coordination** between different revolutionary workers'
parties.]{.underline} Revolutionaries in Russia, Italy, France, Germany,
the US, Australia and elsewhere attempted [to clarify and develop a
strategy for **overthrowing capitalism**]{.underline} everywhere. In
none of these countries was there a party like the Bolsheviks, steeled
in years of organising working-class struggle to overthrow the state,
and capable of leading a revolution. But [for a number of years,
**workers came close** to overthrowing capitalism]{.underline} in
several countries.

[In periods of stability, when social conservatism dominates,
international revolution can **seem like a pipe dream**. Defenders of
the status quo **actively work** to **reinforce this illusion**. But
**history** proves that the **crises** that the **system generates** are
**international**, and that they will inevitably **provoke international
resistance**]{.underline}.

[Capitalism is a **global system**. It requires a **global movement** to
tear it up]{.underline}, root and branch. [But it also makes global
revolution more **possible**, and more **likely**. The most important
thing]{.underline} that socialists can do, whether you live in Hong Kong
or France, Myanmar or Australia, [is to get stuck into **organising for
it** today]{.underline}.

#### Worldwide movement is possible\-\--[latent discontent]{.underline} is mounting but unifying under [collective struggle]{.underline} is a [historical necessity]{.underline} to [preserve humanity]{.underline}.

Indeed, [history has been unkind to all such attempts to provide
detailed forecasts of the future]{.underline}, particularly if they
simply extend current trends and leave the bulk of humanity and their
struggles out of the picture. [It is for this reason that a
**dialectical view** is so important. The actual course of history can
**never be predicted**. The only thing certain about **historical
change** is the **existence** of the **struggles** that drive it forward
and that guarantee its discontinuous character. Both **implosions** and
**explosions** inevitably materialize, rendering the **world** for new
generations **different** than that of the old. History points to
**numerous social systems** that have **reached** the **limits** of
their ability to **adapt** their **social relations**]{.underline} to
allow for the rational and sustainable use of developing productive
forces. [Hence, the human past is dotted by **periods of regression**,
followed by **revolutionary accelerations**]{.underline} that sweep all
before them. As the conservative historian Jacob Burckhardt declared in
the nineteenth century, "a historical crisis" occurs when "a crisis in
the whole state of things is produced, involving whole epochs and all or
many peoples of the same civilization.... The historical process is
suddenly accelerated in terrifying fashion. Developments which otherwise
take centuries seem to flit by like phantoms in months or weeks, and are
fulfilled." He called this the "acceleration of historical processes."91

Burckhardt principally had in mind social revolutions, like the French
Revolution of 1789. This was an acceleration of history that, as the
modern French historian Georges Lefebvre explained, commenced as a
series of widening revolutions, mutating with terrifying speed, from an
aristocratic revolution to a bourgeois revolution to a popular
revolution and then a peasant revolution---finally taking on the
character of a historic "bloc, a single thing," seemingly unconquerable,
which reshaped much of world history.92

Could such a revolutionary acceleration of history, though on an
incomparably greater scale, happen in the twenty-first century? Most
establishment commentators in the hegemonic countries of the world
imperialist system would say no, based on their own narrow experience
and limited view of history. Nevertheless, [**revolutions** continue to
**break out** in the periphery of the world system]{.underline} and are,
even now, only put down by imperialist economic, political, and military
interventions. Moreover, [the **failure of capitalism** on a **planetary
scale** today **threatens all of civilization and life** on the
planet]{.underline} as we know it. [If **drastic changes** are not made,
**global temperature** this century will increase by 4° or even
6°C]{.underline} from preindustrial times, [leading to conditions that
will **imperil humankind**]{.underline} as a whole. Meanwhile, the
extreme capitalism of today seeks to expropriate and enclose all the
bases of material existence, siphoning off almost the entire net social
surplus and robbing the natural environment for the direct benefit of a
miniscule few.

[As a **direct result** of capitalist social relations, the **material
challenges** now facing humanity are greater than anything
ever]{.underline} seen before, [pointing to an **accumulation of
catastrophe** along with the **accumulation of capital**]{.underline}.93
[Hundreds of millions of people]{.underline} under these circumstances
[are already being **drawn into struggles** with the system, creating
the **basis** of a new **worldwide movement** toward
socialism]{.underline}. In his book [Can the Working Class Change the
World?]{.underline} Yates answers [**yes**, it can. But]{.underline} it
can [only]{.underline} do so [through a **unifying struggle** by workers
and peoples]{.underline} aimed at genuine socialism.94

[It may be **objected** that socialism has been tried and has failed and
hence **no longer exists** as an **alternative**]{.underline}. However,
[like the earliest attempts at capitalism]{.underline} in the Italian
city-states of the late Middle Ages, [which were **not strong enough**
to survive]{.underline} amongst the [feudal societies]{.underline} that
surrounded them, [the failure of the first experiments at socialism
presage nothing but its **eventual rebirth** in a new, **more
revolutionary**, **more universal** form, which examines and learns from
the failures]{.underline}.95 [Even in failure, socialism has this
advantage over capitalism: it is motivated by the demand for "freedom in
general," rooted in substantive equality]{.underline} and sustainable
human development---reflecting precisely those collective social
relations, [borne of **historical necessity** and the unending struggle
for human freedom, **crucial** to **human survival**]{.underline} in our
time.96

The great conservative economist Joseph Schumpeter, who, as Austrian
finance minister in Red Vienna, had allied himself for a time with the
socialist government and found himself attacked on all sides, once wrote
that [capitalism would perish not because of "the weight of economic
failure," but rather because its "very success" in pursuing its **narrow
economic ends**, had **undermined** the **sociological foundations** of
its existence. Capitalism]{.underline}, Schumpeter exclaimed,
["'inevitably' creates conditions in which it will not be able to
live]{.underline} and which strongly point to socialism as its heir
apparent."97 He was, it turns out, in many ways correct, though not
entirely in the way he expected. [The **global development** of
**monopoly capitalism** and **financialization** spearheaded by the very
same counterrevolutionary neoliberalism]{.underline} that first arose in
response to Red Vienna in the interwar years---at a time when Schumpeter
himself was a major actor---[has now undermined the material bases, not
so much of capitalism itself, but of global society and planetary
ecology. The result has been the emergence of an "atmosphere of almost
**universal hostility**" to the **prevailing social
order**]{.underline}, though, playing out in the confused context of the
present, less as opposition to capitalism itself than to
neoliberalism.98

[It is capitalism's undermining of the very basis of human existence
that will eventually **compel** the world's **workers** and **peoples**
to **seek new roads forward**. An **inclusive**, **class-based
movement** toward socialism in this century will **open up the
possibility** of qualitative **new developments** that the **anarchy**
of the capitalist-market society with its **monopolistic competition**,
**extreme inequality**, and **institutionalized greed** cannot possibly
offer]{.underline}.99 This includes the development of a socialist
technology, in which both the forms of technology utilized and the
purposes to which they are put are channeled in social directions, as
opposed to individual and class gain.100 [It introduces the prospect of
long-term **democratic planning** at all levels of society, allowing
decisions to be made and distributions to occur outside the logic of the
cash nexus]{.underline}.101 Socialism, in its most radical form, is
about substantive equality, community solidarity, and ecological
sustainability; it is aimed at the unification---not simply
division---of labor.

### AFF\-\--Cap K\-\--!\-\--Cap Good/Transition Bad

#### Spreading capitalism creates [global prosperity]{.underline} and [environmental sustainability]{.underline}. Abandoning it is [disastrous]{.underline}.

**Rhonheimer, 20**---teaching professor at the Pontifical University of
the Holy Cross (Martin, "Capitalism is Good for the Poor -- and for the
Environment,"
<https://austrian-institute.org/en/subjects-en/catholic-social-doctrine-2/capitalism-is-good-for-the-poor-and-for-the-environment/>,
dml)

[It is **not social policy** but **capitalism** that has **created
today's prosperity**]{.underline}.

What is important is that [what **made today's mass prosperity
possible** -- a phenomenon **unprecedented in history** --
was]{.underline} not social policy or social legislation, organised
trade union pressure, or corrective interventions in the capitalist
economy, but rather [**market capitalism** itself, due to its **enormous
potential for innovation** and the **ever-increasing productivity** of
human labour that resulted from it.]{.underline}

[Increasing prosperity and quality of life are **always the result** of
increasing labour productivity. **Only increased productivity** enabled
**higher social standards**, **better working conditions**, the
**overcoming of child labour**, a **higher level of education**, and the
**emergence of human capital**. This process]{.underline} of increasing
triumph over poverty and the constantly rising living standards of the
general masses [is taking place on a **global scale** -- but **only**
where the **market economy** and **capitalist entrepreneurship are able
to spread**]{.underline}.

From industrial overexploitation of nature to ecological awareness

[The **first phase** of]{.underline} industrialisation and [capitalism
was characterised by]{.underline} an enormous
**[consumption]{.underline}** of resources [and]{.underline} frequent
**[overexploitation]{.underline}** of nature, [which]{.underline} soon
[**gave the impression** that this process **could not be
sustainable**]{.underline}. Since the end of the 19th century,
[**disaster** and **doom** scenarios have **repeatedly been put
forward**, but]{.underline} in retrospect they [have **proved to be
wrong**: The combination of **technological innovation**, **market
competition**, and **entrepreneurial profit-seeking** (with the
compulsion to **constantly minimise costs**) have meant that these
scenarios **never occurred**. The **ever-increasing population** has
been **increasingly better supplied** thanks to **innovative
technologies**, **ever-increasing output** with **lower consumption** of
resources **less harmful** to the environment]{.underline} -- e.g.
[**less arable land** in agriculture, or **oil** and **electricity**
instead of **coal**]{.underline} for rapidly increasing mobility. [More
recent disaster scenarios]{.underline}, such as those [spread by
**reputable scientists**]{.underline} since the late 1960s and in the
1970s, [have also proved to be **inaccurate**]{.underline}.

[The **reason** things developed differently was the **always
underestimated innovative dynamism** of the **capitalist market
economy**, a **growing ecological awareness** and]{.underline}, as a
result, [legislative intervention that **took advantage** of the logic
of market capitalism]{.underline}: As a result of the ecological
movement that had come out of the United States since 1970, wise
legislation began to use the price mechanism to apply market incentives
to internalize negative externalities. [Environmental pollution was
**given a price-tag**]{.underline}.

[This led to an **enormous decrease in air pollution** and **other
ecological consequences** of growth, which is **only possible in free**,
**market-based societies**, because the production process here is
characterized by **competition** and **constant pressure to reduce
costs**]{.underline}, i.e. [to the **most profitable use** of
resources]{.underline}. On the other hand, **[all forms of
socialism]{.underline}**, i.e. a state-controlled economy, [have proved
to be **ecological disasters** and have left behind **destruction of
gigantic proportions**, without providing the population with
**anything** that is **near comparable in prosperity**, often even by
**destroying existing prosperity**, such as happened in
**Venezuela**]{.underline}.

Capitalist profit motive combined with digitalization as a solution:
Increasing decoupling of growth and resource consumption

Moreover, [**technological innovations** combined with **capitalist
profit-seeking** and **market competition** have led to a new and
surprising phenomenon]{.underline} over the past decades, [which is
still **hardly noticed**]{.underline} in the public debate: [the
**decoupling** of growth and resource consumption]{.underline}
("**[dematerialization]{.underline}**"). [In a **wide variety** of
industrial sectors, the developed countries]{.underline}, above all the
U.S., [are now achieving **ever greater productive output** with
**increasingly fewer resources**]{.underline}. This has a lot to do with
technology, especially the digitalization of the economy and of our
entire lives.

As the well-known MIT professor Andrew McAfee shows in his book More
from Less, published in October 2019, [this]{.underline} process also
[follows the logic of **capitalist profit maximization**]{.underline}.
To get it going, we do not need politics, even though wise, properly
incentivizing legislation can be helpful and sometimes necessary. Above
all, however, it is [the **combination of technological innovation**,
**capitalist profit-seeking**, and **market-based entrepreneurial
competition**]{.underline} that [will]{.underline} also
**[solve]{.underline}** the problem of man-made **[global
warming]{.underline}**.

In addition, [**property rights** and their protection are **decisive**
for the **careful use of natural resources**]{.underline}. And where
this is not possible, legal support for collective self-governing
structures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, are
important---as is analysed by Nobel Economic Prize winner Elinor Ostrom.
By contrast, the growing ideologically motivated [**anti-capitalist
eco-activism**, and the policies influenced by it, are leading in the
**wrong direction**, **distracting precisely** from what would be **best
for the climate** and the **environment**---and **distracting us** from
what could **help protect us** against the **inevitable consequences of
global warming**]{.underline}.

#### Alt fails\-\--[transition wars]{.underline} and [domestic pressure]{.underline} means the alt [abandons fidelity]{.underline} to the environment.

**Smith \'19** \[Noah; 4/5/19; Bloomberg Opinion columnist, former
assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University; \"Dumping
Capitalism Won't Save the Planet,\"
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/capitalism-is-more-likely-to-limit-climate-change-than-socialism\]

[It has become **fashionable**]{.underline} on social media and [in
certain publications to argue that **capitalism is killing the
planet**]{.underline}. Even renowned investor Jeremy Grantham, hardly a
radical, made that assertion last year. [The **basic idea** is that the
**profit motive** drives the **private sector** to **spew
carbon**]{.underline} into the air with reckless abandon. Though many
economists and some climate activists believe that the problem is best
addressed by modifying market incentives with a carbon tax, [many
activists believe that the problem can't be addressed **without
rebuilding** the **economy**]{.underline} along centrally planned lines.

[The climate threat is certainly dire]{.underline}, and carbon taxes are
unlikely to be enough to solve the problem. [But eco-socialism
is]{.underline} probably [**not** going to be an **effective method** of
addressing that threat. **Dismantling** an **entire economic system** is
**never easy**, and probably would **touch off armed conflict** and
**major asdasd upheaval**. In the scramble to win those battles, even
the socialists would almost certainly abandon their limitation on
**fossil-fuel use**]{.underline} --- [either to support **military
efforts**, or to keep the population from turning against them. The
precedent here is the **Soviet Union**, whose multidecade effort to
**reshape its economy** by **force** amid **confrontation** with the
West led to profound **environmental degradation**. The world\'s climate
does not have several decades to spare]{.underline}.

[Even **without international conflict**, there's **little guarantee**
that moving away from capitalism would **mitigate our impact** on the
environment]{.underline}. Since socialist leader Evo Morales took power
[in Bolivia, living standards have improved substantially]{.underline}
for the average Bolivian, which is great. [But this has come at the cost
of higher emissions. Meanwhile, the capitalist U.S managed to **decrease
its per capita emissions**]{.underline} a bit during this same period
(though since the U.S. is a rich country, its absolute level of
emissions is much higher).

In other words, [in terms of **economic growth** and **carbon
emissions**, Bolivia looks]{.underline} similar to more
[capitalist]{.underline} developing countries. [That suggests that
**faced with a choice** of enriching their people or helping to save the
climate, even **socialist leaders** will often choose the former. And
that same political calculus will probably hold in China and the
U.S.,]{.underline} the world's top carbon emitters --- [leaders who
demand **draconian cuts** in **living standards** in pursuit of
environmental goals will have **trouble staying in power**]{.underline}.

[The **best hope** for the climate therefore lies in **reducing the
tradeoff** between **material prosperity** and **carbon emissions**.
That requires **technology**]{.underline} --- [**solar**, **wind** and
**nuclear power**, **energy storage**, **electric cars** and other
vehicles, carbon-free cement production and so on. The **best climate
policy** plans all involve **technological improvement** as a **key
feature**.]{.underline}

#### The alt [locks in extinction]{.underline} if they're right about [environmental sustainability]{.underline}\-\--there [isn't time]{.underline} for a [global transition]{.underline} from capitalism and [no certainty]{.underline} it [ends emissions]{.underline}.

There are important elements of truth in such views, but we should also
be careful to not push this point too far. [Some commentators have
argued that one **silver lining** outcome of the **pandemic** was that,
because of the **economic lockdown**, **fossil fuel** consumption and
**CO2 emissions** plunged alongside overall **economic
activity**]{.underline} during the recession. While this is true, [I do
not see any positive lessons here with respect to advancing a **viable
emissions program** that can get us to **net zero** emissions by
**2050**]{.underline}. Rather, [the experience demonstrates why a
**degrowth approach** to **emissions reduction** is **unworkable**.
Emissions did indeed fall sharply because of]{.underline} the pandemic
and the [recession. But that is only because **incomes collapsed** and
**unemployment spiked** over this same period. This only **reinforces
the conclusion** that the **only effective** climate stabilization
**path** is the **Green New Deal**, as it is the only one that does not
require a **drastic contraction**]{.underline} (or "degrowth") [of jobs
and incomes to drive down emissions]{.underline}.

[A genuinely **positive development** of]{.underline} the pandemic and
[recession is that **progressive activists** around the world have
fought to include **Green New Deal investments** in their countries'
**economic stimulus**]{.underline} programs. [It is **critical** to
**keep pushing** the **development** and **success** of these
initiatives]{.underline}.

[In support of that end, we must **seriously consider** how to **best
maximize** both the **short-term stimulus**]{.underline} benefits [and
long-term impacts of Green New Deal programs]{.underline}. I know the
importance of such considerations from personal experience working on
the green investment components of the 2009 Obama American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act, in which \$90 billion of the \$800 billion total was
allocated to clean energy investments in the United States. The
principles underlying these investment components were sound, but the
people who worked on the program in its various stages, including
myself, did not adequately calculate the time necessary to execute many
of the projects. We knew that it was critical to identify "shovel-ready"
projects---ones that could be quickly implemented on a large scale and
provide an immediate economic boost. But relatively few green investment
projects were truly shovel-ready at that time, as the green energy
industry was still a newly emerging enterprise. Therefore, the backlog
of significant new projects was thin. It is only moderately less thin
today.

This means that people designing Green New Deal stimulus programs must
identify the subgroup of green investment projects that can
realistically roll into action at scale within a matter of months. One
example that should be applicable in almost every country would be
energy efficiency retrofits of all public and commercial buildings. This
would entail improving insulation, sealing window frames and doors,
switching over all lightbulbs to LEDs, and replacing aging heating and
air conditioning systems with efficient ones (preferably heat pumps).
These programs could quickly generate large numbers of jobs for
secretaries, truck drivers, accountants, construction workers, and
climate engineers. They could also save energy and reduce emissions
quickly and relatively cheaply. Building off of such truly shovel-ready
projects, the rest of the clean energy investment program could then
accelerate and provide a strong foundation for economies moving out of
recession and onto a sustainable recovery path.

CP: [Eco-socialism is becoming a major tenet of the **ideological
repertoire**]{.underline} of green parties in European countries and
elsewhere, which may be the reason for their increasing appeal with
voters and especially the youth. Is eco-socialism a cohesive enough
political project to be taken seriously as an alternative for the
future?

NC: Insofar as I understand eco-socialism---not in great depth---it
overlaps greatly with other left socialist currents. That being said, [I
don't think we're at a stage where **adopting** a **specific "political
project"** is very helpful. There are **crucial issues** that **have**
to be **addressed**, **right now**. Our efforts should be **informed**
by the kind of **future society** that we want, and the kind that **can
be constructed** within our existing society]{.underline}. It's fine to
stake out specific positions about the future in more or less detail,
but for now these seem to me at best ways of sharpening ideas rather
that platforms to latch on to.

[A **good argument** can be made that **inherent features** of
capitalism lead]{.underline} inexorably [to the ruin of the environment,
and that **ending capitalism** must be a **priority** of the
environmental movement. But there's one **fundamental problem** with
this argument:]{.underline} [**time scales**. Dismantling capitalism is
**impossible in the time frame that we have** for taking urgent action,
which requires **national** and **international** mobilization if
**severe crisis** is to be averted]{.underline}.

[Furthermore, the whole discussion]{.underline} around eco-socialism [is
**misleading**. The **two efforts**]{.underline}---[averting
**environmental disaster**, and **dismantling capitalism** in favor of a
**freer** and more **just society**]{.underline}---[should and can
**proceed in parallel**]{.underline}. One [example is Tony Mazzocchi's
efforts to **forge a labor coalition** that would not only **challenge**
owner-**management control** of the workplace, but also be at the
**forefront** of the **environmental movement** while attempting to
**socialize major sectors** of U.S. industry. There's **no time to
waste**. The struggle must be]{.underline}, and can be, [undertaken on
all fronts.]{.underline}

CP: Bob, in your view, can eco-socialism coexist with the Green New Deal
project? And, if not, what type of a politico-ideological agenda might
be needed to generate broad political participation in the struggle to
create a green future?

RP: In my view, [details of rhetoric and emphasis aside, eco-socialism
and the Green New Deal are fundamentally the same project.]{.underline}
[The Green New Deal, as we have discussed the term, offers the **only
path to climate stabilization** that can also expand **good job
opportunities** and **raise living standards** in **all regions** of the
world. It defines an **explicit** and **viable alternative** to
austerity economics on a **global scale**]{.underline}. My coworkers and
I have worked on this issue---advancing the Green New Deal as an
alternative to austerity economics---in different country settings over
the past few years, including in Spain, Puerto Rico, and Greece. [In my
view, the Green New Deal is the **only approach to climate
stabilization** also **capable** of **reversing rising inequality** and
**defeating** global **neoliberalism** and]{.underline} ascendant
**[neofascism]{.underline}**.

[Beyond the Green New Deal, I don't know what exactly "eco-socialism"
could mean. Does it mean the **overthrow** of **all private ownership**
of productive assets for public ownership?]{.underline} As Noam
suggested, [do people **seriously think** that this could happen within
the **time frame we have** to stabilize the climate, that
is]{.underline}, within [less than **thirty years**? And are we certain
that eliminating all private ownership would be workable or desirable
from a **social justice** standpoint]{.underline}---i.e. from the
standpoint of advancing well-being for the global working class and
poor? [How do we deal with the fact that **most** of the world's
**energy assets** are **already publicly owned**]{.underline}? How,
[more specifically, can we be **certain** that a transition to
**complete public ownership** would itself deliver zero net emissions by
2050? To me, the **overarching challenge** is trying to understand
**alternative pathways** to most **effectively building** truly
egalitarian, democratic, and ecologically sustainable
societies]{.underline}---[putting all labels aside and being willing, as
**Marx** himself insisted, to employ "ruthless criticism" toward all
that exists, including all past experiences with Communism and
Socialism.]{.underline} And, for that matter, being open to criticizing
all authors, including Marx himself. Indeed, my favorite quote from Marx
is "I am not a Marxist."

This book has applied what I believe is the immensely powerful idea of a
mission to solving the 'wicked' problems we face today. In it, I have
argued that [tackling grand challenges will only happen if we reimagine
**government as a prerequisite for restructuring capitalism** in a way
that is inclusive, sustainable and **driven by
innovation**.]{.underline}

First and foremost, this means reinventing government for the
twenty-first century -- equipping it with the tools, organization and
culture it needs to drive a mission-oriented approach. It also means
bringing purpose to the core of corporate governance and taking a very
broad stakeholder position across the economy. It means changing the
relationship between public and private sectors, and between them and
civil society, so they all work symbiotically for a common goal. The
reason for the emphasis on rethinking government is simple: **[only
government has the capacity to bring about transform]{.underline}**ation
**[on the scale needed.]{.underline}** The relationship between economic
actors and civil society shows our problems at their most profound, and
this is what we must unravel.

[We can start by recognizing that capitalist markets are an outcome of
how each actor in the system is organized and governed, and how the
different actors relate to one another]{.underline}. This holds for the
private and public sectors and for other sectors such as non-profits.
**[No particular kind of market behaviour is inevitable]{.underline}**.
[For example, the market pressure often cited as forcing a business to
neglect the long term in favour of the short term, as too many companies
do today, is the product of a particular organization of the
market]{.underline}. **[Nor is there anything inevitable in government
bureaucracies]{.underline}** [being too slow to react to challenges such
as digital platforms and climate change.]{.underline} Rather, [both are
outcomes of agency, actions and **governance** structures that are
chosen inside organizations, as well as the legal and institutional
relationships between them. It is all down to design within and between
organizations.]{.underline}

Capitalism is, indeed, in crisis. But the good news is that we can do
better. We know from the past that public and private actors can come
together to do extraordinary things. I have reflected on how, fifty
years ago, going to the moon and back required public and private actors
to invest, to innovate and to collaborate night and day for a common
purpose. Imagine if that [collaborative purpose]{.underline} today was
to [build a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism: green production
and consumption]{.underline}, [less inequality]{.underline}, greater
personal fulfilment, **[resilient health care]{.underline}** and healthy
ageing, sustainable mobility and digital access for all. But small,
incremental changes will not get us to those outcomes. We must have the
courage and conviction to lift our gaze higher -- to lead transformative
change that is as imaginative as it is ambitious, aiming for something
far more ambitious than sending a man to the moon.

To do this successfully, [governments need to invest in their internal
capabilities -- building the competence and confidenc]{.underline}e to
think boldly, partner with business and civil society, catalyse new
forms of collaboration across sectors, and [deploy instruments that
reward actors willing to engage with the difficulties]{.underline}. The
task is neither to pick winners nor to give unconditional handouts,
subsidies and guarantees, but to pick the willing. And missions are
about making markets, not only fixing them. They're about imagining new
areas of exploration. They're about [**taking risks**, not only
'de-risking']{.underline}. And if this means making mistakes along the
way, so be it. Learning through trial and error is critical for any
value-creation exercise. [Ambitious missions also have the courage to
tilt the playing field.]{.underline}

If [government]{.underline} is indeed a value creator that is driven by
public purpose, its [policies should reflect and reinforce]{.underline}
that. Too many green policies today are just minor adjustments to a
trajectory that still favours the old waste-prone behaviours and the
financial casino that worsens inequality. [A healthy economy that works
for the whole of society must tilt the playing field consistently to
reward behaviours that help us achieve agreed and desirable
goals.]{.underline} That means achieving [coherence in a **multiplicity
of fields**]{.underline}, from **[taxes]{.underline}** to
**[regulation]{.underline}**, from **[business law]{.underline}** to the
**[social safety net]{.underline}**.

As emphasized throughout the book, [it is key to not pretend that social
missions are the same as technological ones]{.underline}. With
challenges that are more 'wicked' it is essential that moonshot thinking
is linked with support to underlying government systems. For example, a
[moonshot around]{.underline} disease testing or **[health
priorities]{.underline}** [must interact closely with the public-health
system, not **replace** or **circumvent** it]{.underline}. Similarly, a
moonshot around [clean growth]{.underline} must [interact with transport
systems and planning authorities and understand behavioural
change]{.underline}. Thus it is [critical to]{.underline} perceive
missions not as siloed projects but as being intersectoral, bottom-up,
and [building on existing]{.underline} systems (such as **[innovation
systems]{.underline}**, among others).

Governments cannot pursue missions alone. They must work alongside
purpose-driven businesses to achieve them. As I've argued in this book,
this requires addressing one of the biggest [dilemmas of modern
capitalism]{.underline}: **[restructuring business]{.underline}** [so
that private profits are reinvested back into the economy rather than
being used for short-term financialized purposes]{.underline}. Missions
can accelerate this shift by shaping expectations about where business
opportunities lie and also getting a better return for public
investment. In this sense they can begin to walk the talk of stakeholder
value. This means creating a more symbiotic form of partnership and
collaboration in different sectors, whether in health, energy or digital
platforms. A market-shaping perspective requires governing these
interactions so that intellectual property rights, data privacy, pricing
of essential medicines and taxation all reflect what needs to happen to
reach the common objective. [In health that must mean health innovation
driven by the mission of better health care for all; in energy it must
mean divestment from fossil fuels and the creation of public goods like
green infrastructure and green production systems]{.underline} that
protect the earthly oasis that Armstrong referred to; and in the digital
domain it must mean the use of [digitalization to improve the access of
all people to the power of the technologies of the twenty-first
century]{.underline} -- while ensuring both data privacy and that our
welfare states are strengthened, not weakened, by digital platforms.

**[Doing capitalism differently]{.underline}** [requires reimagining the
full potential of a public sector driven by public purpose --
democratically defining clear goals]{.underline} that society needs to
meet by investing and **[innovating together]{.underline}**. It requires
a fundamentally new relationship between all economic actors willing and
able [to tackle complexity to achieve outcomes that matter.]{.underline}
