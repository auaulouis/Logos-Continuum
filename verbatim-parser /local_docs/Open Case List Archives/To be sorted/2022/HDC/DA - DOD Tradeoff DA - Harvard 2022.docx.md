#### US-Taiwan security cooperation is [expanding now]{.underline}, but success depends on [sustained]{.underline} US support

**[Bilateral military initiatives are]{.underline}** reportedly
**[expanding]{.underline}**, [in accordance with the growing threat
posed by China]{.underline}. [Washington is]{.underline} reportedly
[considering using special **op**]{.underline}erator[**s** to help
Taipei to conduct irregular warfare, including establishing resistance
networks and countering an amphibious landing. This could support
Taiwan's grassroots efforts to mount a **whole-of-society** defense of
the island, integrating civilian militias with active-duty and reserve
military personnel]{.underline}. Earlier this year, [the United States
and Taiwan signed a coast guard cooperation agreement]{.underline}.
Taiwan is fielding coast guard vessels capable of carrying anti-ship
missiles and envisions its coast guard as a second navy during wartime.
[Taiwan is also revamping its military reserve system. These are
**complex** **undertakings** that]{.underline} would **[benefit from
substantial U.S. advice and assistance]{.underline}** --- [especially if
they are to be realized this decade]{.underline}. [Congress is also
**pushing** for more tangible U.S. support to Taiwan's defensive
preparedness]{.underline}, beyond routine U.S. arms sales. The recently
introduced Taiwan Deterrence Act and Arm Taiwan Act would authorize \$2
billion and \$3 billion a year respectively in foreign military
financing for Taiwan. [This could help Taipei to purchase relevant
defense articles]{.underline} like survivable communications systems,
coastal defense cruise missiles (including in shipping containers),
small missile boats, sea mines, loitering munition swarms, and mobile
air defenses. The Taiwan Partnership Act would establish a partnership
between the U.S. National Guard and Taiwan's military. Taiwan's plan to
spend an extra \$9 billion on domestically manufactured missiles and
other capabilities may also generate demand for increased U.S. military
assistance.

#### NATO cyber-defense is [enormously]{.underline} expensive

**Sanger 16**, White House and national security correspondent, and a
senior writer @ NYT (David, "As Russian Hackers Probe, NATO Has No Clear
Cyberwar Strategy," *New York Times*,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/world/europe/nato-russia-cyberwarfare.html)//BB>

[At United States Cyber Command]{.underline}, which has [expanded
rapidly]{.underline} since the United States carried out cyberattacks
against Iran in 2010, Russia's networks are a regular target of
surveillance. By next year, Cyber Command will have more than 130 teams
fully in operation around the world, integrated into Army, Navy, Marine
and Air Force units, in addition to teams that work alongside the
National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md. It has built up a vast early
warning network, placing tens of thousands of "implants" --- sensors
that can also be used to insert malware --- into networks around the
world. [But NATO is **only beginning** to explore what it delicately
calls "active defense,"]{.underline} and says it is not focused on
offensive cyberweapons. [The Russians have no such
compunctions]{.underline}. But it is unclear what Russian hackers hope
to achieve here in the Baltics, other than to make the point, as they
did in 2007 when they brought Estonia to an electronic halt, that they
can get into any system, anytime. "Whatever the Russians have in mind
--- mostly intimidation --- it usually fails," said Estonia's president,
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who grew up in New Jersey before coming here to
turn this small NATO country into a pioneer in introducing new web-based
technology for governing a nation. The 2007 attacks backfired, he noted,
because they drove Estonians far more solidly into the European and NATO
camps. In Sweden and Finland, neutral nations in the Cold War, the
politics are more complex. As the NATO exercise began in Finland last
week, the Finnish foreign minister was in Moscow, meeting his Russian
counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov. The more Sweden and Finland turn to NATO,
the more their networks, their news sites and their government
ministries come under cyberattack. As Adm. John Richardson, the chief of
United States naval operations, said at an event at the Council on
Foreign Relations in May, "[The fact is it's a pretty hot war in the
cyber domain going on right now." A hot war, but a kind that suits
Russia well: It is part of what military strategists call "gray zone"
combat.]{.underline} [For]{.underline} Mr. [Putin]{.underline},
[cyberespionage and cyberattacks keep NATO and its partners off
balance]{.underline}. **[They are enormously difficult and expensive to
defend against]{.underline}**, and, at least for now, they have operated
below the line that is likely to prompt a military or economic response.
"It stays below the radar," Martin Libicki of the RAND Corporation told
a conference sponsored this month by the NATO cyber center here,
officially known as the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of
Excellence. For the Russians, Mr. Libicki said, cyberespionage and
weaponry are part of a larger strategy of information warfare and a
blitz of propaganda that makes sorting out fact from fiction --- say,
the causes of the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine --- all the more
difficult. But the attacks also remind the smaller nations here of their
vulnerability, even if Russia's troops stay on their side of the border.
[So far, NATO has found few effective means of deterring
attacks]{.underline}.

#### Aid to Ukraine is the brink. It's temporary reinforcement. But, doubling-down on permanent security cooperation requires a tradeoff with Asia. Turns the case. 

**Wertheim 22**, senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is the author of
"Tomorrow, the World: The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy." "Europe is
showing that it could lead its own defense," *Washington Post*,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/03/europe-defense-nato-ukraine-war/>)//BB

[Providing **temporary** reinforcements is the right decision **today**
in the face of Russia's bald aggression]{.underline}. [But the United
States **should resist the inclination** to revive its role as the
military protector of Europe]{.underline}, especially [since Europe is
awakening to its responsibilities]{.underline}. Britain is sending
troops to the Baltic states and Poland. France is pushing "strategic
autonomy" for the European Union. And days after halting the Nord Stream
2 pipeline supplying natural gas from Russia, Germany reversed a
long-standing ban on providing military assistance and sent weapons to
Ukraine. Germany also vowed to spend more than 2 percent of its economy
on defense, finally committing to meet NATO's target. German Chancellor
Olaf Scholz declared his country, and Europe, to have reached a
"historic turning point." Both Americans and Europeans would benefit if
Scholz's words prove true. In the coming years, [European states
should]{.underline} move to **[take the lead]{.underline}** in their
collective defense, and the United States should do everything possible
to encourage them. To stake the defense of Europe on the United States,
over the next decade and beyond, would be to answer Putin's rash gamble
with a slow-moving gamble of our own. It might seem as though the United
States will remain able and willing to protect all of NATO's 28 European
countries far into the future. After all, America has orchestrated
Europe's defense for the past eight decades. Yet it did so under two
markedly different conditions. During World War II and the Cold War, the
United States sought to stop totalitarian powers from conquering the
region. An Axis or Soviet takeover of Europe would have closed off the
entire continent to liberal, American-style interaction and influence,
and put the Western Hemisphere on the defensive. After the Cold War,
however, as the Soviet threat collapsed, the United States recommitted
to Europe not because the stakes were high but arguably because they
were low. Threats were so negligible that it seemed U.S. leadership
could keep things that way through modest exertion --- and spread
democracy to boot. Expanding NATO eastward, American officials convinced
themselves that what had been a military alliance was more comparable to
a political club, one that need not become an adversary of Russia.
Russia's assault on Ukraine ends that chapter and begins a new one. The
prospect of further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe cannot be
dismissed as negligible, as it was in the 1990s or 2000s. At the same
time, Russia poses far less a threat to overrun Europe and threaten
American security or prosperity than the Soviet Union did. After all,
the Russian economy is roughly one-fifth the size of that of the
European Union, and that was before the severe sanctions of the past
week. Although Russia has built a formidable military, one that enables
it to launch wars like that in Ukraine, NATO's European members
collectively outspend Russia on defense. During the Cold War, by
contrast, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact boasted land forces superior in
number to those of NATO (including the U.S. share), and the gap between
its economic output and that of Western Europe was several times smaller
than Russia's shortfall today. In the security environment now emerging,
with Russia menacing Eastern Europe, the United States is set to face
major costs and the ultimate risk: great-power war between nuclear
peers. Yet [the threat Russia poses remains one that Europeans could
handle themselves, with America acting as a supporter **rather than the
leader**]{.underline}. [The United States remains a superpower. Why
shouldn't it be the main counterweight in Europe to Moscow?]{.underline}
[There are]{.underline} two [reasons]{.underline} both [the United
States]{.underline} and Europe [would be better off if it declined this
role]{.underline}. One lies in **[Beijing]{.underline}**, and the other
in Washington. [The United States has already identified China as its
primary rival, embarking on "strategic competition" with the world's
number-two power. Taking on China and Russia at once would be **unwise**
and likely **impossible**]{.underline}. True, the Pentagon has
previously planned to fight two wars at once, but those wars were
envisioned as "regional" conflicts against small states like Iran, Iraq
or North Korea. In practice, the United States had difficulty
prosecuting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan simultaneously. [China and
Russia represent challenges of a far greater magnitude]{.underline},
which explains why the Pentagon abandoned its two-war standard in 2018,
even as its budget has grown. [If the United States **doubles down on
European security** while leading the charge in Asia]{.underline}, **[it
may]{.underline}** either **[fall short in both places or default on its
commitments in Europe just when they come due]{.underline}**.

#### Perception is key. Re-commitment to NATO at the [expense of Asia]{.underline} triggers Chinese aggression against Taiwan

**Sacks 22**, research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, where
his work focuses on U.S.-China relations, U.S.-Taiwan relations, Chinese
foreign policy, cross-Strait relations, and the political thought of
Hans Morgenthau (David, "Don\'t Pivot From the Pivot to Asia," *Council
on Foreign Relations*,
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/dont-pivot-pivot-asia)//BB>

[With]{.underline} Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline}, major
[war has returned to Europe and with it calls for the United States to
prioritize countering the present threat posed by Russia
over]{.underline} the threat [China]{.underline} could one day pose.
[But Russia's ineffectiveness on the battlefield, paired with the
increasing investments European nations are making in their defense,
gives the United States a better opportunity than ever **to finally
pivot to Asia** and **focus on the more formidable challenge China
represents**]{.underline}. [A failure to do so could **embolden China**
and give Beijing an **opening to increase its influence**, to the
detriment of U.S. security and prosperity]{.underline}. Over a decade
ago, President [Obama announced the "pivot]{.underline}" or "rebalance"
to Asia in a speech to the Australian Parliament, declaring "the United
States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia
Pacific region." The president's speech followed an essay by Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton entitled "America's Pacific Century," where she
argued for a "strategic turn to the region." All too often, however, the
United States has failed to pair this ambitious rhetoric with policies
that reflected the region's importance. Now, Putin's aggression against
Ukraine has led to a growing consensus that the United States needs
[**to**]{.underline} view Russia as its primary geopolitical challenge
and **[shift resources to Europe]{.underline}**. But such a
reorientation of U.S. strategy **[would]{.underline}** again [**delay
the pivot** to Asia just when it is both **more necessary and more
viable than ever**]{.underline}. The reasoning may be counterintuitive
but holds all the same. The [war in Ukraine has revealed Russia's
military is incapable of waging modern warfare and does not have the
ability to fundamentally threaten NATO]{.underline}. Russia failed to
establish air superiority over Ukraine, its logistics are in shambles,
and morale among its soldiers is reportedly dangerously low. The
defining image of this war thus far is of a stalled Russian convoy
stretching forty miles on a road leading to Kyiv. Overcoming these
issues will take years and require a fundamental overhaul of Russia's
military culture and doctrine. Russia will have to undertake these
difficult reforms with its military in tatters. While it is difficult to
know exactly how many casualties Russia has suffered in Ukraine, it is
well into the thousands, and the Russian military will likely suffer far
greater losses if it attempts to take Kyiv. [Russia has lost some of its
most advanced fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, and artillery, while
depleting its munitions. It will take a long time for Russia to rebuild
its material strength, a prospect that will be even more daunting given
the sanctions that are in force]{.underline}. [The crisis in Ukraine has
also forced European countries to awaken from their slumber, and they
are now willing to shoulder a greater burden for their
defense]{.underline}. Most consequentially, Germany has announced it
will increase its defense spending to 2 percent of GDP and purchase 35
F-35 fighter jets, which will increase interoperability with NATO
forces. Sweden is also looking to increase its defense spending to 2
percent of GDP, while support for joining NATO has surged in the
country. Denmark has pledged to meet the 2 percent target, while Latvia,
Poland, and Romania have signaled they will boost defense spending to
exceed that target. [A depleted and exhausted Russian military and
increased European investments in their defense mean the United States
can meet its obligations to its NATO allies while **shifting resources
to Asia**]{.underline}. As such, [the Department of Defense should
continue to identify China **as the pacing challenge** given its
military might and its regional ambitions.]{.underline} [Taiwan **should
remain the pacing scenario**, as it is the most difficult one for the
United States to address and therefore if the United States gets that
right it will be well-positioned to respond to other regional
contingencies]{.underline}. [**Capabilities**]{.underline} most relevant
[**for** a **Taiwan scenario should be prioritized**]{.underline}, in
particular long-range missiles and submarines, while the United States
should continue to distribute its military presence throughout the
region. With NATO's conventional capabilities set to improve, once this
crisis passes the United States should withdraw the seven thousand
troops it sent to Europe following Russia's invasion and review its
force posture on the continent, where it currently has ninety thousand
service members based. [While Putin has upended European security,
nothing has occurred since the war in Ukraine began that reduces the
challenge that China poses for the United States]{.underline}. China's
military spending shows no sign of slowing down and is projected to
increase by over 7 percent this year. It is continuing to invest in
capabilities designed to prevent the United States from successfully
intervening on behalf of its allies and is rapidly expanding its nuclear
arsenal. China's economy is set to grow by 5.5 percent this year and it
is pulling additional economies into its orbit with the entry into force
of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and ongoing Belt and
Road Initiative investments. While [the United States]{.underline}
certainly needs to deal with the urgent threat to European security, it
[cannot lose sight of the more serious and multidimensional challenge
coming from Beijing]{.underline}. Indeed, [if the **perception takes
root** that the United States is pivoting away from Asia and **toward
Europe** this could prompt China to conclude it has a **window of
opportunity** for remaking the regional order]{.underline}.

#### China-Taiwan war goes nuclear. Deterrence is key. It's fast and more probable than European war.

**Pettyjohn** and Wasser 5-20-20**22**, \*senior fellow and director of
the defense program at the Center for a New American Security,
\*\*fellow in the defense program and co-lead of The Gaming Lab at the
Center for a New American Security (Stacie and Becca, "A Fight Over
Taiwan Could Go Nuclear," *Foreign Affairs*,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-05-20/fight-over-taiwan-could-go-nuclear/)//BB>

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." [Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. But if
China attempted to forcibly invade Taiwan]{.underline} and the United
States came to Taipei's aid, [the **threat of escalation could
outstrip** even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe]{.underline}. A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a
New American Security in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027, with the aim of
examining how the United States and China might act under a certain set
of conditions. The game demonstrated that [China's military
modernization and expansion of its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}---not to
mention the importance Beijing places on unification with Taiwan---[mean
that, in the real world, a fight between China and the United States
could very well go nuclear]{.underline}. [Beijing views Taiwan as a
breakaway republic. If the Chinese Communist Party decides to invade the
island, its leaders may not be able to accept failure]{.underline}
without seriously harming the regime's legitimacy. [Thus, the CCP might
be willing to take significant risks to ensure that the conflict ends on
terms that it finds acceptable]{.underline}. That would mean convincing
the United States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are
so high that it is not worth contesting the invasion. While China has
several ways to achieve that goal, [from Beijing's perspective, using
nuclear weapons may be the most effective]{.underline} means to keep the
United States out of the conflict. China is several decades into
transforming its People's Liberation Army (PLA) into what the Chinese
President Xi Jinping has called a "world-class military" that could
defeat any third party that comes to Taiwan's defense. China's
warfighting strategy, known as "anti-access/area denial," rests on being
able to project conventional military power out several thousand miles
in order to prevent the American military, in particular, from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, [a growing
nuclear arsenal provides Beijing with coercive leverage as well as
potentially new warfighting capabilities, which could increase the risks
of war and escalation]{.underline}. China has historically possessed
only a few hundred ground-based nuclear weapons. But last year, nuclear
scholars at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the
Federation of American Scientists identified three missile silo fields
under construction in the Xinjiang region. The Financial Times reported
that China might have carried out tests of hypersonic gliders as a part
of an orbital bombardment system that could evade missile defenses and
deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the continental United States. The
U.S. Department of Defense projects that by 2030, China will have around
1,000 deliverable warheads---more than triple the number it currently
possesses. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that
as early as five years from now the PLA will have made enough
conventional and nuclear gains that it could fight and win a war to
unify with Taiwan. [Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members
of Congress, former government officials, and subject matter experts
assumed the roles of senior national security decision makers in China
and the United States---[illustrated that a U.S.-Chinese war could
escalate quickly]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed that [both
countries would face operational incentives to strike military forces on
the other's territory]{.underline}. In the game, such strikes were
intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk
a fine line by attacking only military targets. But [such attacks
crossed red lines for both countries, and produced a **tit-for-tat cycle
of attacks that broadened the scope and intensity of the
conflict**]{.underline}. For instance, in the simulation, China launched
a preemptive attack against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region.
The attacks targeted Guam, in particular, because it is a forward
operating base critical to U.S. military operations in Asia, and because
since it is a territory, and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed
striking it as less escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In
response, the United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and
surrounding facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese
mainland. Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on
their home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii. A NEW ERA One particularly alarming finding from the war game is
that China found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start
in order to ward off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was
repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland China had been
attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would
back down from the fight received greater attention by the China team
than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty convincing
the United States that its nuclear threats were credible. In real life,
China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and
readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may
not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its
smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making
nuclear threats. This may push China to preemptively detonate a nuclear
weapon to reinforce the credibility of its warning. [China might also
resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because of constraints on
its long-range conventional strike capabilities]{.underline}. Five years
from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response. The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between
the United States and China are different from those that were most
likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States
feared a massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would
precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over
Taiwan, however, Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited
way to signal resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the
battlefield. It is unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of
limited nuclear use and whether the United States could de-escalate the
situation while still achieving its objectives. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION
[The clear lesson from the war game is that the United States needs to
**strengthen**]{.underline} its [**conventional capabilities** in the
Indo-Pacific to ensure that China **never views an invasion of Taiwan as
a prudent tactical move**]{.underline}. To do so, the United States will
need to commit to maintaining its conventional military superiority by
expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in
undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to conduct offensive
operations inside the first and second island chains even while under
attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute U.S. forces,
enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can effectively defend
Taiwan in the face of China's attacks. Moreover, [the United States
needs to]{.underline} develop an integrated network of partners willing
to **[contribute to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}**. Allies are an
asymmetric advantage: the United States has them, and China does not.
[The United States should **deepen strategic and operational planning**
with key partners to **send a strong signal of resolve** to
China]{.underline}. As part of these planning efforts, the United States
and its allies will need to develop war-winning military strategies that
do not cross Chinese red-lines. The game highlighted just how difficult
this task may be; what it did not highlight is the complexity of
developing military strategies that integrate the strategic objectives
and military capacities of multiple nations. Moving forward, military
planners in the United States and in Washington's allies and partners
must grapple with the fact that, in a conflict over Taiwan, China would
consider all conventional and nuclear options to be on the table. And
[the United States is **running out of time** to strengthen deterrence
and keep China from believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful.
**The biggest risk** is that Washington and its friends choose not to
seize the moment and act: **a year or two from now**, it might already
be too late]{.underline}.

The United States has a nasty habit of firing resources at a military
problem first and asking questions about effective implementation later
--- as recently demonstrated in Iraq and Afghanistan --- but that does
not have to be the case with Taiwan. [U.S. officials are **starting to
get more serious** about supporting Taiwan's ability to defend itself.
They debate competing policy stances on defending Taiwan]{.underline}
(ambiguity versus clarity) [but largely agree that "bolstering Taiwan's
self-defenses is an urgent task and an **essential feature of
deterrence**]{.underline}," as recently stated by the Pentagon's top
official for Asia. [Experienced U.S. officials are raising the alarm
that China may attempt forceful unification with Taiwan]{.underline}
later this decade [if deterrence continues to erode]{.underline}. In the
1970s, the United States used triangular diplomacy to gain leverage over
the Soviet Union by opening relations with China and eventually
switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei, which Washington had
previously recognized as the seat of the legitimate Chinese state and
government, to Beijing. Prior to this switch in 1979, the U.S. Military
Assistance Advisory Group-Taiwan was the central hub for planning,
coordinating, and executing defense cooperation initiatives. It served
as the eyes, ears, and voice of the U.S. military to the Taiwanese armed
forces. It possessed the requisite staff and planning horsepower to
facilitate the large-scale military arms transfers, training, and
advising that contributed to decades of Taiwanese military superiority
over China, which has since evaporated. [U.S.-Taiwanese defense
initiatives are **ramping up** --- to levels unseen since 1979 --- due
to legitimate concerns about Chinese designs on the island]{.underline}.
However, the thick military organizational connective tissue that
existed prior to 1979 is no longer in place to facilitate this
cooperation. Without a military organization focused on the island, the
U.S. personnel, funding, and materiel poured into supporting Taiwan may
be inefficiently applied and generate limited return on investment ---
defined in terms of deterrence and lethality in conflict. To help to
deter Chinese aggression, the United States should establish a 21st
century version of this often forgotten advisory group to provide the
staff capacity, synchronization, and interagency integration required to
facilitate increasingly robust U.S.-Taiwanese military collaboration,
bolster Taiwan's defenses, and strengthen its will to fight. Despite
inevitable Chinese government counterpressure, reestablishing this
organization would probably not trigger military conflict and would be
consistent with the U.S. commitment to the One China policy, guided by
the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six
Assurances.

### Neg\-\--DOD DA\-\--U\-\--Resolve High Now

#### Resolve high now, because Biden is prioritizing Asia above Europe

**Erlanger** 9-28-20**21**, chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe,
based in Brussels (Steven, "The Sharp U.S. Pivot to Asia Is Throwing
Europe Off Balance," *New York Times*,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/world/europe/biden-china-europe-submarine-deal.html>)

[Until this week, the so-called "pivot to Asia" by the United States had
been more of a threat than a reality for Europe. But that changed when
the Biden administration announced a new defense alliance against
China]{.underline} that has left Europe facing an implicit question:
Which side are you on? It is a question [that European leaders
have]{.underline} studiously [sought to avoid]{.underline} since former
President Barack Obama first articulated [that]{.underline}
[America]{.underline} should "**[pivot]{.underline}**" [resources and
attention to Asia as part of its rivalry with China]{.underline}.
European leaders hoped that the relationship between the two superpowers
could remain stable and that Europe could balance its interests between
the two. Then the Trump administration sharply raised the temperature
with China with tariffs and other trade barriers. And now the Biden
administration on Wednesday announced an alliance between the United
States, Britain and Australia that would help Australia deploy
nuclear-powered submarines in the Pacific --- and, in doing so, also
tore up a \$66 billion deal for Australia to buy a French fleet of
diesel-powered subs. "Europeans want to defer the moment of truth, to
not make a choice between the two," said Thomas Gomart, director of the
French Institute of International Relations, or IFRI. "The
**[Biden]{.underline}** administration, like the Trump one, **[is
provoking]{.underline}** the moment of **[choice]{.underline}**." France
was enraged. Yet if it was a humiliation --- as well as the cancellation
of a lucrative defense deal --- it possibly did have a silver lining for
France's broader goals. President Emmanuel Macron of France has been
Europe's loudest proponent of "strategic autonomy," the idea that Europe
needs to retain a balanced approach to the United States and China. "We
must survive on our own, as others do," said Josep Borrell Fontelles,
the European Union's foreign policy chief, echoing the French line. The
French embarrassment --- the Americans also announced the submarine deal
with little if any warning --- came after the disastrous fall of
Afghanistan. European allies were furious with the Biden administration,
blaming the Americans for acting with little or no consultation and
feeding Mr. Macron's argument that the United States is no longer an
entirely reliable security partner. "The submarines and Afghanistan, it
reinforces the French narrative that you can't trust the Americans,"
said Ulrich Speck of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. Emmanuel
Macron's Second Term as President of France With the reelection of
Emmanuel Macron, French voters favored his promise of stability over the
temptation of an extremist lurch. Cabinet: President Macron's new
government combines continuity with change, as newcomers at the foreign
and education ministries join first-term veterans. New Prime Minister:
Élisabeth Borne, the minister of labor who previously was in charge of
the environment, will be the second woman to hold the post in France.
Overcoming Tragedy: Ms. Borne's father, a World War II resistance member
and a Holocaust survivor, killed himself when she was 11, an experience
she has rarely discussed in public. Rape Allegations: Two women have
accused Damien Abad, the newly appointed minister for solidarity and for
disabled people, of raping them. Mr. Abad has denied the allegations.
But whether France will succeed in turning this bilateral defeat into a
way to promote strategic autonomy is doubtful, analysts suggest. "Many
Europeans will see this as a transparent way for the French to leverage
their own interests," said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, the
London-based research institution. Even so, there seems little doubt
that Europe's balancing act is becoming trickier to maintain. "Europe
needs to think hard about where it sits and what it does," said Rosa
Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe. A Europe that spends more on
defense is to be desired, but it also needs allies --- including Britain
and the United States, she said. And a Europe that does more to build
its own security capacity "is the best way to be listened to more by its
partners," she added. The new alliance, known as AUKUS, is an effort to
integrate Australia and Britain into the broader American effort to
create a security deterrent to China. For Australia, which has seen its
once-strong relations with Beijing deteriorate, America and Britain
provide a much stouter deterrent to China in the Indo-Pacific, analysts
agree, than could the deal with France. "[It's **sending a very big
signal to Beijing**, which is useful for the U.S]{.underline}., but
especially useful to Australia," said Ian Lesser, acting director of the
German Marshall Fund and head of its Brussels office. "[And the weight
of that signal is important]{.underline} because of who the partners
are."

*Bloomberg*,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-06-05/niall-ferguson-on-china-biden-should-dust-off-the-word-detente>)

[The most remarkable thing about the foreign policy of the Biden
administration is that helping Ukraine defeat Russia is **not even its
top priority**]{.underline}. "[Even as President Putin's war
continues]{.underline}," **[declared]{.underline}** Secretary of State
Antony **[Blinken]{.underline}** in a speech at George Washington
University on May 26, "[we will remain focused on the most serious
long-term challenge to the international order]{.underline} --- and
that's posed by the People's Republic of **[China]{.underline}**."
Blinken's speech repays close study. About one-tenth of it was
conciliatory. "We are not looking for conflict or a new Cold War," he
declared. "We do not seek to transform China's political system. ... We
will engage constructively with China wherever we can." But the rest was
as hawkish a speech on China as the one delivered by then Vice President
Mike Pence in October 2018, which for me was the moment Cold War II got
going in earnest. In Blinken's words: Under President Xi, the ruling
Chinese Communist Party has become more repressive at home and more
aggressive abroad. We see that in how Beijing has perfected mass
surveillance within China and exported that technology to more than 80
countries; how its advancing unlawful maritime claims in the South China
Sea, undermining peace and security, freedom of navigation, and
commerce; how it's circumventing or breaking trade rules ... and how it
purports to champion sovereignty and territorial integrity while
standing with governments that brazenly violate them. [Blinken spelled
out how the US intends to "shape the strategic environment around
Beijing]{.underline}," citing the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework
for Prosperity, announced by Biden on his recent Asia tour, and [the
Quad]{.underline} of the US, Australia, India and Japan, with [its new
Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness]{.underline},
[not forgetting AUKUS]{.underline}, the US deal on nuclear submarines
with Australia and the UK. But the most startling lines in Blinken's
speech were the ones on "the genocide and crimes against humanity
happening in the Xinjiang region"; on US support for "Tibet, where the
authorities continue to wage a brutal campaign against Tibetans and
their culture, language, and religious traditions"; on Hong Kong, "where
the Chinese Communist Party has imposed harsh anti-democratic measures
under the guise of national security"; on "Beijing's aggressive and
unlawful activities in the South and East China Seas"; and --- the coup
de grace from a Chinese vantage point --- on "Beijing's growing
coercion" and "increasingly provocative rhetoric and activity" toward
Taiwan. The response of the Chinese Foreign Ministry to this
confrontational speech was, I thought, surprisingly restrained.
**[Taiwan is, of course, the key issue]{.underline}**. As if to confirm
Xi Jinping's darkest suspicions, Biden went off script again at a press
conference in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on May
23. A reporter asked if the United States would defend Taiwan in the
event of a Chinese attack. "Yes," the president answered. "That's the
commitment we made. We agree with a one-China policy. We\'ve signed on
to it and all the intended agreements made from there. But the idea
that, that it (Taiwan) can be taken by force, just taken by force, is
just not, is just not appropriate."

(Dustin, "Biden Must Do Better Than Obama on Ukraine," Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/27/biden-obama-russia-ukraine-military-strategy-nato/>)

The Winter Olympics are just around the corner. Russian President
Vladimir Putin has Ukraine on his mind. In Washington, the [Pentagon is
preparing a new defense strategy]{.underline} that looks beyond the
Middle East [to focus on the Pacific and China. The White House,
meanwhile, is concerned about costs and wants to rein in military
spending]{.underline}. Sound familiar? Well, this is exactly what the
world looked like once before---in 2014. When the Obama administration's
defense strategy was released in March 2014, the document was obsolete
the day it was published. It did not mention Ukraine, even though
Putin's little green men had already seized Crimea. It did not mention
the Islamic State by name, though the group's fighters had already
captured Fallujah. With the defense budget under spending caps and the
threat of sequestration, the Pentagon had to spend tens of billions of
dollars in contingency funds to rebuild European deterrence following
Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine and to defeat the Islamic
State in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the Obama administration's attempt
to pivot to Asia stalled, and the U.S. military edge over China
continued to shrink. As history threatens to repeat itself, U.S.
President Joe Biden---who served under Barack Obama as vice
president---looks perilously close to following in his predecessor's
footsteps. [Biden faces the same question as in 2014: How can the United
States stay focused on China while dealing with]{.underline} the crisis
in [Ukraine]{.underline}? Just as it was then, prioritizing the
Indo-Pacific and countering China will not be strategically effective or
politically sustainable if it is premised on sacrificing the commitment
to credible NATO deterrence and defense. But [given **finite
resources**, the United States **cannot** confront China, the most
powerful adversary it has ever faced, without **substantially changing**
how it achieves strategic ends in
Europe]{.underline}---[especially]{.underline} when it comes to
**[military power]{.underline}**. That's not just an urgent strategic
question to answer now, as Washington decides how to deal with Russia's
threatened invasion of Ukraine. It also needs to be at the core of the
Pentagon's strategy that is set to be published as early as March.
**[The administration must resist calls]{.underline}** for a return to a
strategy designed **[to win on two fronts simultaneously]{.underline}**
or in sequence. [**Right now**, the United States can do a lot to
support Ukraine]{.underline}, impose costs on Russia,
**[and]{.underline}** [assure NATO allies without compromising its
strategy to counter China]{.underline}. At the top of the list are
accelerated deliveries of defensive military equipment to
Ukraine---especially anti-armor, anti-ship, and air defense
capabilities---as well as intelligence support and humanitarian
assistance. If Russia does invade, Biden should get much more serious
about sanctions than Obama was in 2014. Washington should target the
wealth of Putin's cronies in Western financial hubs, terminate Russian
access to the SWIFT global payment system, prohibit transactions in
Russian sovereign debt, sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and cut off
access to U.S. technology critical for industries favored by Putin,
including defense. The Trump administration's technology sanctions that
have seriously hobbled the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei are
an excellent precedent for this. The United States should also join NATO
efforts to reinforce its eastern flank, including contributing U.S.
troops to support the temporary activation and deployment of NATO's
Response Force. For this eventuality, the Biden administration has
placed up to 8,500 U.S. military personnel on alert.
**[But]{.underline}** even as Washington reacts to Moscow's threats to
overturn the European security order, **[China]{.underline}** and the
Indo-Pacific **[must remain the primary focus of the United States'
strategic calculus]{.underline}**. To that end, the administration
should ensure sanctions do not inflict collateral damage on Indo-Pacific
allies and partners. In particular, ensnaring India in Russia-focused
sanctions for New Delhi's planned purchase of the Russian S-400 air and
missile defense system would be a mistake. Sanctions won't stop the
S-400 deal, but they would play into the narrative pushed by Moscow and
Beijing that Washington is not a trustworthy partner for New Delhi. [To
keep its focus squarely on the Indo-Pacific, the United States must
exercise **restraint** in what]{.underline} forces **[it sends
to]{.underline}** reinforce **[NATO]{.underline}** should Putin invade
Ukraine, and from where. Forces should not be taken from the Pacific.
They should be relocated within Europe, from the United States, or from
lower-priority theaters. For example, air and ground forces stationed in
the Middle East could be moved to southeastern Europe to bolster NATO
while remaining close enough to respond to any contingency. Deployment
of an additional U.S. Army brigade combat team---of limited utility
vis-à-vis China---may be sensible. But the Pentagon should avoid new,
long-term deployments of assets in low supply, such as missile defense
systems and advanced platforms for intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance. The Biden administration should also remember that
allies provide the bricks, while the United States provides the mortar.
[NATO allies should contribute the bulk of any new forces]{.underline}
deployed to guard the alliance's eastern flank while the United States
provides key military enablers such as command and control, logistics,
and combat medicine. The good news is that allies are in fact stepping
up: Denmark, France, Spain, and the Netherlands have all recently
announced or proposed reinforcements of ships, fighter aircraft, and
ground forces. Even as it responds to the crisis in Europe, Washington
can take parallel steps to bolster deterrence in the Pacific---so that
the current attention on Europe is not interpreted as a sign of weakness
and distraction, as it was in 2014. For example, the Biden
administration could announce plans to station a fifth and eventual
sixth attack submarine in Guam. It could also back legislation on
Capitol Hill to increase security assistance to Taiwan. Taking these
steps during a crisis in Europe would send a powerful signal to Beijing
and allied capitals that the United States' priority on the Pacific
perseveres. The **[Biden]{.underline}**
administration**['s]{.underline}** new defense [strategy needs to
confront the question of overstretch head-on. Given **limited
resources** and the strength of the United States'
adversaries---**especially China**---the U.S. ability to prevail in a
great-power conflict cannot be taken for granted]{.underline}. [That's
why the administration must resist calls for a return to a strategy
designed to win on two fronts simultaneously]{.underline} or in
sequence. [Such a force sizing is simply not realistic and **would
dilute the U.S. military's focus on the Indo-Pacific as its priority
theater**, China as its pacing threat, and Taiwan as **its pressing
scenario**]{.underline}. Critically, [staying on track in the Pacific
requires matching any new military commitments in
Europe]{.underline}---even temporary ones---[with new
resources]{.underline}. [The United States **must not ask its military
to do more with less** or pretend that China]{.underline} and Russia
[can be deterred]{.underline} and confronted [on the cheap]{.underline}.
Now is not the time to cut defense spending as the Biden administration
has proposed. Not when the U.S. military edge relative to China has so
dangerously eroded. Not when inflation, aging platforms, rising
personnel costs, and the failure to pass a budget on time are sapping
the Pentagon's buying power. The Biden administration and the U.S.
Congress must provide the military with the sufficient, timely, and
predictable funding demanded in these perilous times, and which U.S.
service members deserve.

#### Security cooperation with NATO [trades off]{.underline} with commitments to Asian allies

**Bowne 18**, Major, Judge Advocate in the US Air Force (Andrew,
"Defending The New Fulda Gap: Deterring Russian Aggression Against The
Baltic States Through Fiscal Legislation," *Military Law Review*,
226.3)//BB

Although it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the precise
amount of expenditures the United States commits directly to NATO,
estimates by RAND Corporation and the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) place the total costs of keeping U.S.
forces in key industrial nations at less than \$10 billion a year, or
less than two percent of the total defense budget.58 While the United
States increased defense spending by over eighty percent since 2001,
"virtually none of that increase was generated by NATO commitments."59
When compared to the defense posture the United States fielded in Europe
during the Cold War, [the resources currently obligated to defending
Europe are remarkably low.]{.underline} In 1990, approximately fifteen
percent of the total worldwide active strength was stationed in Europe,
whereas only three percent of a significantly smaller total active force
remains in Europe in 2017.60 Thus, despite the political rhetoric and
fact that the United States spends more on defense than all other NATO
members combined, it is clear [the]{.underline} actual [contribution to
NATO is a relatively small portion of the overall U.S. defense budget.
It is critical to understand the parameters of the United States'
contribution to NATO because the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has **finite resources**, and, since enactment
of the Budget Control Act]{.underline} (BCA) of 2011, [**legally binding
caps** on funding]{.underline}.61 [Every dollar spent towards the
objectives of NATO is]{.underline}, in theory, [**a dollar less**
going]{.underline} to fight the Islamic State or **[towards the Pacific
pivot]{.underline}**. However, the misunderstanding of the true costs of
the United States' role in NATO could have dangerous consequences. If
the U.S. budgets and plans for NATO operations based on the false
premise that it already spends too much and its partners do not
contribute enough, U.S. leadership will likely make decisions that
adversely affect its own national security interests.

#### NATO cyber-defense is [enormously]{.underline} expensive

**Sanger 16**, White House and national security correspondent, and a
senior writer @ NYT (David, "As Russian Hackers Probe, NATO Has No Clear
Cyberwar Strategy," *New York Times*,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/world/europe/nato-russia-cyberwarfare.html)//BB>

[At United States Cyber Command]{.underline}, which has [expanded
rapidly]{.underline} since the United States carried out cyberattacks
against Iran in 2010, Russia's networks are a regular target of
surveillance. By next year, Cyber Command will have more than 130 teams
fully in operation around the world, integrated into Army, Navy, Marine
and Air Force units, in addition to teams that work alongside the
National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md. It has built up a vast early
warning network, placing tens of thousands of "implants" --- sensors
that can also be used to insert malware --- into networks around the
world. [But NATO is **only beginning** to explore what it delicately
calls "active defense,"]{.underline} and says it is not focused on
offensive cyberweapons. [The Russians have no such
compunctions]{.underline}. But it is unclear what Russian hackers hope
to achieve here in the Baltics, other than to make the point, as they
did in 2007 when they brought Estonia to an electronic halt, that they
can get into any system, anytime. "Whatever the Russians have in mind
--- mostly intimidation --- it usually fails," said Estonia's president,
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who grew up in New Jersey before coming here to
turn this small NATO country into a pioneer in introducing new web-based
technology for governing a nation. The 2007 attacks backfired, he noted,
because they drove Estonians far more solidly into the European and NATO
camps. In Sweden and Finland, neutral nations in the Cold War, the
politics are more complex. As the NATO exercise began in Finland last
week, the Finnish foreign minister was in Moscow, meeting his Russian
counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov. The more Sweden and Finland turn to NATO,
the more their networks, their news sites and their government
ministries come under cyberattack. As Adm. John Richardson, the chief of
United States naval operations, said at an event at the Council on
Foreign Relations in May, "[The fact is it's a pretty hot war in the
cyber domain going on right now." A hot war, but a kind that suits
Russia well: It is part of what military strategists call "gray zone"
combat.]{.underline} [For]{.underline} Mr. [Putin]{.underline},
[cyberespionage and cyberattacks keep NATO and its partners off
balance]{.underline}. **[They are enormously difficult and expensive to
defend against]{.underline}**, and, at least for now, they have operated
below the line that is likely to prompt a military or economic response.
"It stays below the radar," Martin Libicki of the RAND Corporation told
a conference sponsored this month by the NATO cyber center here,
officially known as the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of
Excellence. For the Russians, Mr. Libicki said, cyberespionage and
weaponry are part of a larger strategy of information warfare and a
blitz of propaganda that makes sorting out fact from fiction --- say,
the causes of the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine --- all the more
difficult. But the attacks also remind the smaller nations here of their
vulnerability, even if Russia's troops stay on their side of the border.
[So far, NATO has found few effective means of deterring
attacks]{.underline}.

<https://time.com/6153902/russia-major-cyber-attacks-invasion-ukraine/)//BB>

It's likely that the combined efforts of Microsoft, the U.S., and many
other countries and companies to ramp up cyber defenses both in and
outside of Ukraine has undoubtedly helped curb the damage caused by
these efforts. But if Russia really had on hand a stockpile of
previously undetected vulnerabilities and sophisticated malware designed
to exploit them, these lines of defense simply would not be enough to
prevent some significant damage and disruption. [Updating critical
infrastructure networks and systems is **slow**, **expensive**,
**complicated** work and it's **impossible** that every potential target
has been hardened to the point where it is no longer vulnerable to
Russian cyberattacks---unless those cyberattacks were never all that
impressive to begin with]{.underline}.

#### Even if the plan [seems]{.underline} cheap, it will [outpace]{.underline} cost projections because of military squandering of resources

Marine Corps officer (Peter, "The Limits of Security Cooperation," *War

<https://warontherocks.com/2013/09/the-limits-of-security-cooperation/)//BB>

SC does work to build capacity in certain, relatively elite units that
perceive a real need for improvement and hard training. Likewise, it
works to build interoperability between already-capable partner forces
and U.S. and coalition militaries. SC in the right doses can be a good
way of showing solidarity with allies against other regional threats.
But [SC \[Security Cooperation\] is not a panacea and must be applied
with significantly more discernment than the usual
some-is-good-more-is-better logic of U.S. military
spending]{.underline}. Planners should go to great lengths to ensure
that SC is seen as a tool for a specific purpose, not a reward to
condition behaviors. SC-as-a-conditioning-tool becomes bribery with
diminishing returns. If policymakers want a quid pro quo, they need to
admit as much and use much more precisely targeted incentives: paying a
fee for access or head-of-the-line transit privileges for example. This
becomes a much more predictable business transaction than trying to use
SC funds, winks, and nudges to get one's way. Finally, [in the land of
perverse incentives, SC is often seen as a means to drive defense
business to U.S. contractors. This is true. By creating arms
races]{.underline} and supplying prestige weapons, however useless, to
unstable areas of the world, [they are creating U.S. jobs. But wouldn't
taxpayer money and efforts be better spent if officials more precisely
targeted]{.underline} domestic [concerns]{.underline} with taxpayer
funds [rather than hoping that efforts trickle down
predictably]{.underline} from collaboration with corpulent and unsavory
foreign generals? [In the land of perverse incentives, SC **funding is
one of the most egregious**]{.underline}---and in the post-9/11 era,
many officials see SC as a critical tool of strategic positioning.
However, [the premises of SC must be reconsidered before the U.S.

<https://time.com/6152096/us-support-ukraine-china-priority/>)

[How should America respond to]{.underline} Russia's abominable invasion
of [Ukraine]{.underline}? This is a question of immense importance.
Right now, there is more heat than light in the discussion. Given the
momentous stakes, Americans must respond to this crisis [with clarity of
mind and sobriety]{.underline}. Moscow's invasion is likely to be a
hinge point in history. If nothing else, it lays to rest the idea that
history is over, that power politics and the threat of war are gone from
the developed areas of the world. This is sad, but it is a reality. In
developing our response to Russia's brazen act, we must face and adapt
to this reality. For too long, we have discounted the hard facts of
international politics. But now America must look at the world situation
much more soberly and strategically, proceeding from these hard facts
rather than ignoring them or wishing them away. Above all, [our response
must be strategic---it must match our response to the threats we face in
light of our resources and the risks we are willing to take
on]{.underline}. [The reality is that we face multiple serious threats
in different parts of the world]{.underline}. The danger Russia poses,
including to our NATO allies, is now very clear. But others have not
gone away. We also must consider Iran, North Korea, transnational
terrorists like al Qaeda, and, above all, the threat of a China that
seeks first hegemony over Asia and then global preeminence. So far this
is familiar. Less familiar but [absolutely critical is the fact that we
do not have a military large or capable enough to fight major wars
against Russia and China in even roughly concurrent
timelines]{.underline}. It is true that Europe is mainly a land theater
and the Western Pacific is mainly a maritime one. But many of the things
our [forces]{.underline} would need [to defeat Russia or China are
needed in both theaters]{.underline}---like heavy penetrating bombers,
attack submarines, advanced munitions, air defenses, and survivable
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems. Even
certain assets once thought most appropriate or necessary for Europe may
well play a critical role in a fight against China, such as Army
long-range missiles and artillery. These and other capabilities like
them would be just as vital for beating back a Russian assault as they
would be for denying a Chinese fait accompli against Taiwan---and are
already in short supply. Unfortunately, this is not a problem that we
can solve easily, quickly, or cheaply. We should seek to redress it,
but, even if we muster the will, it will take years and a significantly
larger defense budget to build more of the things we need to fight a
major war, like penetrating heavy bombers and nuclear-powered attack
submarines. In the meantime, **[what we do have can only be used in one
place at a time]{.underline}**. A missile used in Europe can't be used
in Asia, and a bomber lost over Europe will take years to be replaced.
We do also have an unparalleled network of allies. But a similar problem
confronts us here. In theory our alliance network is far stronger than
the threats we face. But in reality few of our allies have significant
militaries, and it will take those that don't significant time to
develop their armed forces even if they gather the resolve. Over the
long term, then, our strategy should be clear. We should reshape our
military to field far more of the kinds of systems needed to fight a
great power war and, with a few exceptions like sustaining our ongoing
counterterrorism efforts, dispense with those elements that are
ill-suited for it. Meantime, we should press and encourage our allies,
especially Japan, Germany, and Taiwan, to build up their conventional
defenses, and fully enable those, like Poland, Australia, and the United
Kingdom, willing to do more for their and others' defense. But this
strategy will take time to bear fruit. This is the strategy the 2018
National Defense Strategy called for---yet four years later, due to
factors ranging from inertia through political and bureaucratic
resistance to allied footdragging, we still have a long way to go. [In
the coming years]{.underline}, then, [we face]{.underline} what Henry
Kissinger called "**[the necessity for choice]{.underline}**." [We don't
have enough of the right military might to cover all the threats to our
interests. **So we must prioritize**]{.underline}. This is far from
unprecedented. The U.S. and Britain faced this dilemma in 1941, and
elected a "Europe first" strategy, prioritizing defeating much stronger
Nazi Germany before Imperial Japan. Similarly today, **[America must
prioritize]{.underline}** addressing **[the threat China poses in
Asia]{.underline}**. [Asia is the world's "decisive theater" and China
by far the most powerful other state in the world]{.underline}. If China
attains its goal of becoming dominant over Asia, it will control over
half of the global economy. Americans' fundamental liberties and
prosperity will suffer grievously. [This is the most dangerous outcome
for Americans, and preventing it **must be the priority of our foreign
policy**]{.underline}. [In practical military terms, this means that we
must ensure enough of the right military forces]{.underline}---bombers,
submarines, munitions, ISR, and the like---[are ready and available to
defend Taiwan, and on relatively short notice]{.underline}. Taiwan is
China's best target for breaking apart the anti-hegemonic coalition that
is the only way we can prevent Beijing from dominating Asia. If China
seizes Taiwan, it will deal this coalition a huge---possibly
mortal---blow. We cannot allow this. And, crucially, [this is a problem
right now.]{.underline} We don't know Beijing's assessment of the
People's Liberation Army's ability to seize Taiwan. But we do know that
[America's ability to defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan has eroded
very substantially in recent years, that it is continuing to erode, and
that Beijing's perceptions of its ability to take the island **would
rise dramatically** if it knew we had expended]{.underline} or tied down
**[critical parts of our military in or for Europe]{.underline}**. In
other words, [we are in]{.underline} or very close to [the window
**where a successful Chinese attack on Taiwan is possible**, and we
**must hedge against this risk**]{.underline}.

#### The plan [specifically]{.underline} trades off with resources needed to deter China

\[the counterplan defuses threats to NATO without requiring military
spending\]

**Blackwill** and Fontaine **22**, senior fellow at the Council of
Foreign Relations, \*\*Chief Executive Officer of the Center for a New
American Security (Robert and Richard, "Ukraine War Should Slow But Not
Stop the U.S. Pivot to Asia," *Bloomberg*,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-09/russia-s-ukraine-invasion-should-slow-not-stop-u-s-pivot-to-china)//BB>

Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutal and unprovoked invasion of
Ukraine has upended this approach. Now [Washington must deal with
revisionist great powers in two regions]{.underline}, while the Middle
East also continues to demand attention. **[The U.S. should continue
a]{.underline}** long-term **[shift to Asia]{.underline}**, but in a way
that better balances resources and engagements across the three
strategic theaters. Paradoxically, Putin's aggression demonstrates how
this should be done. First, [policy makers should absorb the enduring
strategic logic behind a pivot to Asia. China combines the **greatest
capability and will** to upend the international order. The Indo-Pacific
represents the **primary**]{.underline}, but not the only, regional
[**theater** in which U.S.-China competition takes place]{.underline}.
But a sustainable pivot to Asia is possible only in the absence of
serious national security crises in Europe and the Middle East. No U.S.
president will ignore a Russian-induced emergency in Europe, a major
terrorist threat, or a nuclear and/or hegemonic Iran. America remains a
global and not a regional power. [The central challenge is allocating
national security resources **across**]{.underline} all three
**[regions]{.underline}**, [without]{.underline} either weakening vital
U.S. national interests in one or [imagining that **America can do
everything, everywhere**]{.underline}. [That problem is most acute in
the **military sphere**]{.underline}. An increase in **[defense spending
will be required, but how that money is spent is equally
important]{.underline}**. In the Middle East, for example, regular
troops should relieve the burden placed on elite special operations
forces in security cooperation missions. Washington should move
expensive military equipment --- like F-35 and F-22 aircraft --- to the
two arenas of great-power competition, employing less-capable aircraft,
including unmanned systems, for counterterrorism missions. A combination
of regional diplomacy and continued deterrence could limit Iran\'s
regional ambitions, freeing up some of the forces that have deployed to
the Middle East in recent years to deter a potential Iran threat. [In
Europe, the U.S. should build on its allies' newfound willingness to
enhance their military capabilities and deter further Russian
aggression]{.underline}. This should involve moving American troops
currently stationed in Europe further east, to countries such as Poland,
Romania and the Baltics. Washington should also capitalize on the recent
increase in intelligence sharing -- including to NATO non-members -- by
eliminating barriers to sharing defense technology with allies newly
willing to invest. For **[the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**, Washington
[should **reserve the lion\'s share of military resources**]{.underline}
that matter most, including smaller naval surface ships, long-range
missiles and next-generation fighter aircraft. Building on efforts like
the Aukus security arrangement with Australia and the U.K. would give
regional allies more leverage to strengthen their own defense, helping
them better deter China and serve as the frontline in daily competition
with it. **[Diplomatic resources are less zero-sum than military
power]{.underline}**, and economic engagement less still. [Intense
diplomatic work in Europe]{.underline} and the Middle East [could
**bolster the coalitions** in each that are willing and able to deal
with threats there, and potentially **reduce some of the threats
themselves**]{.underline}. Washington should couple this with an
affirmative economic agenda, beginning with re-entry to or renegotiation
of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.

Finally, [the hefty price tag of]{.underline} an unqualified [commitment
to protect Taiwan would **need to be traded off** against other
potential investments.]{.underline} [The United States must keep its eye
firmly on]{.underline} the larger contest: the broad-based competition
of systems and societies emerging with [the PRC]{.underline}. Historical
lessons on the character of such competitions,\[53\] the geo-economic
character of a wider contest defined by the difficulty of military
conquest, and China's emphasis on gradual, non-military tools of
influence suggest that global economic engagement, technological
rivalries, investments in diplomatic capability, and information
security and cyber capabilities will be more important to the outcome of
the larger competition than the status of Taiwan. At a time, for
example, when the central office charged with overseeing US
cybersecurity has been described as "underfunded, outmatched and
exhausted",\[54\] it does not make sense to pour tens of billions into
capabilities oriented for the defence of Taiwan.

### Neg\-\--DOD DA\-\--!\-\--Turns Case

#### Strategic overstretch causes the US military to fail in [both]{.underline} Europe and Asia

**Wertheim 22**, senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is the author of
"Tomorrow, the World: The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy." "Europe is
showing that it could lead its own defense," *Washington Post*,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/03/europe-defense-nato-ukraine-war/)//BB>

[Providing **temporary** reinforcements is the right decision **today**
in the face of Russia's bald aggression]{.underline}. [But the United
States **should resist the inclination** to revive its role as the
military protector of Europe]{.underline}, especially [since Europe is
awakening to its responsibilities]{.underline}. Britain is sending
troops to the Baltic states and Poland. France is pushing "strategic
autonomy" for the European Union. And days after halting the Nord Stream
2 pipeline supplying natural gas from Russia, Germany reversed a
long-standing ban on providing military assistance and sent weapons to
Ukraine. Germany also vowed to spend more than 2 percent of its economy
on defense, finally committing to meet NATO's target. German Chancellor
Olaf Scholz declared his country, and Europe, to have reached a
"historic turning point." Both Americans and Europeans would benefit if
Scholz's words prove true. In the coming years, [European states
should]{.underline} move to **[take the lead]{.underline}** in their
collective defense, and the United States should do everything possible
to encourage them. To stake the defense of Europe on the United States,
over the next decade and beyond, would be to answer Putin's rash gamble
with a slow-moving gamble of our own. It might seem as though the United
States will remain able and willing to protect all of NATO's 28 European
countries far into the future. After all, America has orchestrated
Europe's defense for the past eight decades. Yet it did so under two
markedly different conditions. During World War II and the Cold War, the
United States sought to stop totalitarian powers from conquering the
region. An Axis or Soviet takeover of Europe would have closed off the
entire continent to liberal, American-style interaction and influence,
and put the Western Hemisphere on the defensive. After the Cold War,
however, as the Soviet threat collapsed, the United States recommitted
to Europe not because the stakes were high but arguably because they
were low. Threats were so negligible that it seemed U.S. leadership
could keep things that way through modest exertion --- and spread
democracy to boot. Expanding NATO eastward, American officials convinced
themselves that what had been a military alliance was more comparable to
a political club, one that need not become an adversary of Russia.
Russia's assault on Ukraine ends that chapter and begins a new one. The
prospect of further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe cannot be
dismissed as negligible, as it was in the 1990s or 2000s. At the same
time, Russia poses far less a threat to overrun Europe and threaten
American security or prosperity than the Soviet Union did. After all,
the Russian economy is roughly one-fifth the size of that of the
European Union, and that was before the severe sanctions of the past
week. Although Russia has built a formidable military, one that enables
it to launch wars like that in Ukraine, NATO's European members
collectively outspend Russia on defense. During the Cold War, by
contrast, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact boasted land forces superior in
number to those of NATO (including the U.S. share), and the gap between
its economic output and that of Western Europe was several times smaller
than Russia's shortfall today. In the security environment now emerging,
with Russia menacing Eastern Europe, the United States is set to face
major costs and the ultimate risk: great-power war between nuclear
peers. Yet [the threat Russia poses remains one that Europeans could
handle themselves, with America acting as a supporter rather than the
leader]{.underline}. [The United States remains a superpower. Why
shouldn't it be the main counterweight in Europe to Moscow?]{.underline}
There are two reasons both the United States and Europe would be better
off if it declined this role. One lies in **[Beijing]{.underline}**, and
the other in Washington. [The United States has already identified China
as its primary rival, embarking on "strategic competition" with the
world's number-two power. Taking on China and Russia at once would be
**unwise** and likely **impossible**]{.underline}. True, the Pentagon
has previously planned to fight two wars at once, but those wars were
envisioned as "regional" conflicts against small states like Iran, Iraq
or North Korea. In practice, the United States had difficulty
prosecuting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan simultaneously. [China and
Russia represent challenges of a far greater magnitude]{.underline},
which explains why the Pentagon abandoned its two-war standard in 2018,
even as its budget has grown. [If the United States doubles down on
European security while leading the charge in Asia]{.underline}, **[it
may]{.underline}** either **[fall short in both places or default on its
commitments in Europe just when they come due]{.underline}**.

[The prospect of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan echoes some of the most
disastrous 20th century instances of great power
expansion]{.underline}---reminiscent, perhaps, of Nazi Germany's
Anschluss or even its subsequent invasion of Poland. Given that the
latter ignited World War II, America's strategic community has been
rightly fixated on the vast military and political contingencies of a
Chinese invasion that would remake Asia. But [Taiwan]{.underline} is not
just the geopolitical fulcrum of the Indo-Pacific; it [is]{.underline}
also [the nexus of a rapidly evolving Sino-American technological
competition]{.underline}. And if 20th century great power competition is
any guide, tech races are just as important to long-term competition as
territorial military contests. The U.S. needs to act now to secure the
technological dimensions of a looming Taiwan crisis, or risk losing far
more than the island. In the domain of Sino-American tech rivalry,
Taiwan is unique in two aspects: First, the Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) remains the world's tightest bottleneck
in the global high-tech ecosystem, with exclusive capabilities to
construct the most valuable, sophisticated computer chips in existence.
Second, [military conflagration in Taiwan would represent a
**hitherto-unknown level of cyber-intensive military
conflict**]{.underline}, the seeds of which likely have already been
planted. Both of [these]{.underline} [realities]{.underline}
**[demand]{.underline}** unprecedented **[cooperation between the United
States and Taiwan]{.underline}**---[cooperation that requires
**significant**]{.underline} trust and openness in Taipei and
significant counter-espionage and [national **security assistance** from
Washington]{.underline}.

long-range hypersonic weapons, 'Trojan Horse' missiles hidden in

Asia,]{.underline}" a long-sought adjustment of U.S. foreign policy to
better reflect the rise of America's most significant military and
economic competitor: China. [But Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine has
made that vexing move **even more complicated**]{.underline}. China's
government has vacillated between full embrace and more measured
responses as Russian President Vladimir Putin prosecutes his war, making
the decisions for Biden far more layered. Biden and China's Xi Jinping
are scheduled to speak by phone on Friday, a conversation that the White
House says will center on "managing the competition between our two
countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine and other issues of
mutual concern." [The Biden administration is left needing to **focus

and I believe [we're entering a period where that's what will be
required of the United States]{.underline} and of this generation of

allies to respond to Russia]{.underline} with crippling sanctions,
supplying an overmatched Ukraine military with \$2 billion in military
assistance --- including \$800 million in new aid announced Wednesday
--- and addressing a growing humanitarian crisis. Eastern flank NATO
allies, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, have
made clear to the Biden administration that they want the U.S. to
increase its military presence in the region and do more to address the
worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II. More than 3
million Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in recent weeks.
[Though the war in Ukraine has dominated Biden's focus of

[With the **world's attention fixed** on]{.underline} the national
security and humanitarian catastrophe in [Ukraine]{.underline} caused by
Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion, [a similar
disaster is brewing in the Pacific]{.underline}. [Taking a page from

conquer the free people of Taiwan]{.underline}. [Preventing that from

from]{.underline} the disaster in [Ukraine]{.underline}. [Among them is
the need for Washington to **spend less time worrying** about provoking
authoritarian bullies and more time working to defend]{.underline}
threatened [democracies]{.underline} before the invasion starts. This is
especially critical as U.S. forces are much more likely to be directly
involved in a response to coercion against Taiwan. For 25 years, Beijing
has pursued a determined strategy featuring military modernization,
technological advancements, economic infiltration, cyberattacks and
persistent disinformation campaigns. These efforts have focused on
building a world-class military, erasing American military supremacy in
the seas and skies around Taiwan, and preparing for a potential attack
designed to establish CCP dominion over Taiwan. Meanwhile, **[the United
States has been distracted]{.underline}** elsewhere, **[unable to focus
its strategic and fiscal efforts on the rising power in
China]{.underline}**. [This has been compounded by consistent
congressional failures to provide the Pentagon with the timely,
sufficient and predictable funding necessary to modernize U.S. forces
and maintain sufficient readiness and capacity]{.underline}. Indeed,
[the Department of Defense has received on-time funding only once in the

#### The US [can]{.underline} focus on both regions at once

<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/18/us-russia-china-war-nato-quadrilateral-security-dialogue/)//BB>

As Russia threatens the largest land invasion in Europe since World War
II, the most consequential strategic question of the 21st century is
becoming clear: [How can the United States]{.underline}
[manage]{.underline} two revisionist, autocratic, nuclear-armed great
powers ([Russia and China]{.underline}) [simultaneously?]{.underline}
[The answer, according to many]{.underline} politicians and [defense
experts, is that Washington must moderate its response to Russia in
Europe to focus on]{.underline} the greater threat posed by
[China]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific. **[This would be a
mistake]{.underline}**. **[The United States]{.underline}** remains the
world's leading power with global interests, and it **[cannot afford to
choose between Europe and the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. Instead,
[Washington]{.underline} and its allies [should develop a defense
strategy capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating Russia and
China at the same time]{.underline}. In recent weeks, Biden has sent
several thousand U.S. troops to reinforce NATO's eastern flank---and for
good reason. A major war in Ukraine could spill across international
boundaries and threaten the seven NATO allies that border Russia,
Belarus, and Ukraine. Moreover, if Russian President Vladimir Putin
succeeds in Ukraine, why would he stop there? Putin has shown a clear
interest in resurrecting the former Russian Empire, and other vulnerable
Eastern European countries---Poland, Romania, or the Baltic
states---might be next. A successful Russian incursion into a NATO
ally's territory could mean the end of the Western alliance and the
credibility of U.S. security commitments globally. The threat posed by
China is also serious. Adm. Philip Davidson, former commander of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, predicted China could invade Taiwan within the
next six years. This is a war the United States might lose. If China
succeeds in taking Taiwan, it would be well on its way to disrupting the
U.S.-led order in Asia, with an eye to doing the same globally.
Moreover, Russia and China are increasingly working together. As this
month's summit between Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping shows,
Moscow and Beijing are forging a closer strategic partnership, including
on military matters. These dictators could coordinate dual attacks on
the U.S. alliance structure or opportunistically seize on the
distraction provided by the other's aggression. In other words, there is
a serious risk of simultaneous major-power wars in both Europe and the
Indo-Pacific. To address this problem, many have proposed answers that
simply will not work. The Biden administration initially hoped to put
relations with Russia on a "stable and predictable" footing to focus on
China, but Putin had other ideas, as the world is now seeing in Ukraine.
Unfortunately, Washington does not get to decide how its adversaries
sequence their aggression. Others have expressed hope that Washington
can peel these powers apart or even align with Russia against China, but
these are not realistic solutions. The misguided view gaining the most
recent acceptance, however, is that Washington should simply choose the
Indo-Pacific over Europe. Politicians and experts argue that the United
States lacks the resources to take on both Russia and China. They point
to China's power and Asia's wealth and argue that Asia should be the
priority. While Washington pivots to Asia, wealthy European countries,
such as Germany, should step up to provide for NATO's defense. Indeed,
the Biden administration's National Defense Strategy, which has been
delayed due to the Ukraine crisis, is expected to focus on China without
offering a clear solution to the two-front-war problem. A good strategy
starts with clear goals---and Washington's objectives are to maintain
peace and stability in both Europe and Asia. [A good
strategy]{.underline}, however, [starts with clear goals, and
Washington's objectives are to maintain peace and stability in **both**
Europe and Asia]{.underline}. U[.S. interests in Europe are too
significant to let them be worked out solely between Putin and the
United States' European allies]{.underline}. Indeed, the European Union,
not Asia, is the United States' largest trade and investment partner,
and this imbalance is much starker when China (which the United States
seeks greater economic decoupling from), is removed from the equation.
Furthermore, China has conducted military exercises in Europe and the
Middle East. Competing with China militarily means competing globally,
not just in Asia. In addition, Xi is gauging U.S. resolve, and a weak
response in Ukraine might make a Chinese move on Taiwan more likely.
Moreover, [**the United States is not France**; it is **not compelled**
to make gut-wrenching strategic choices about its national security due
to constrained resources]{.underline}. In short, publishing [a defense
strategy that can only handle one of the United States' great-power
rivals]{.underline} (which is what is expected from the forthcoming
national defense strategy) [is planning to fail]{.underline}.

[Under the authority of Title 10, Chapter 16, and/or the current
National Defense Authorization Act, DoD provides material assistance and
related training to partner nations]{.underline} to develop specific
capabilities and/or capacities. **[This is normally done
using]{.underline}** **[DoD]{.underline}** Operations and Maintenance
(**[O&M]{.underline}**) **[funding]{.underline}**, [but in some
instances Congress appropriates additional funding for DoD to conduct
these programs]{.underline}. Although it is DoD funding, these programs,
and all security cooperation, must be coordinated with DoS. Security
Cooperation practitioners refer to these programs as Building Partner
Capacity (BPC) programs and execute them using a pseudo Letter of Offer
and Acceptance. All BPC programs require congressional notification.

[The United States conducts a wide range of security cooperation
missions and initiatives]{.underline} that can serve as key enablers of
U.S. foreign policy efforts to assist and influence other countries.
[For a **relatively small investment**, security cooperation
programs]{.underline} can [play an important role by shaping the
security environment and laying the groundwork for future stability
operations with allies and partners]{.underline}. Security cooperation,1
in the form of noncombat military-to-military activities, includes
"normal" peacetime activities, such as building the long-term
institutional and operational capabilities and capacity of key partners
and allies, establishing and deepening relationships between the United
States and partner militaries, and securing access to critical areas
overseas. Security cooperation also can include conducting
quasi-operational efforts, such as helping U.S. partners and allies
manage their own internal defense.

### Aff\-\--DOD DA\-\--No China War

#### **No US-China war**

**Lei 20**, PhD and MA in International Politics, associate research
fellow with the China Institute of International Studies. (Cui,
7-24-2020, \"Despite heated talk, risk of a US-China hot war is small\",
*South China Morning Post*,
<https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3094121/why-risk-us-china-hot-war-small-despite-heated-talk>)

[Many]{.underline} observers [are pessimistic about deteriorating
US-China relations and believe the two countries are **heading
towards**]{.underline} a cold **[war]{.underline}**. Even worse, [some
argue that the situation might be **more dangerous** than the US-Soviet
Union Cold War, and that a **hot war might break out** between the two.
This argument is **unconvincing**]{.underline}. **[First]{.underline}**
of all, [**deterrents** to a flare-up are]{.underline} much
**[strong]{.underline}**er [**in US-China relations** than in US-Soviet
relations]{.underline}. Although economic and people-to-people ties
between China and the US are declining, they are still close compared to
US-Soviet ties. [It is **hard to decouple** two **closely intertwined
economies** and **societies**.]{.underline} Take two examples. [China is
expected to become the world\'s **largest consumer market**, a
temptation **hard to resist** for exporters, **including** those from
the US. And in **education**, more than **300,000 Chinese students**
study in the US, bringing in **huge revenues** for the US education
industry]{.underline}. Many universities go to great lengths to woo
international students. Recently Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology even sued the government over its new visa restrictions,
now aborted, on international students. [Second, **even if** there is
decoupling, the pain would **not be too great** and can be **kept out**
of the **national security sphere**]{.underline} if properly handled. In
fact, for national security reasons, a modest degree of isolation will
make both sides more secure and comfortable. For instance, if China's
information technology equipment cannot capture Western markets, the US
will be more relaxed. If China cannot get advanced technologies from the
US and its technological progress slows down, the US will be less
anxious. In the same vein, China feels assured knowing that if the Trump
administration does impose a travel ban on Communist Party members, it
would be abandoning one of the tools available to the US to promote
"peaceful evolution" in China. Economic decoupling is undeniably more
painful for China than for the US. But unlike Japan during WWII, which
was hit hard by the US oil embargo because of its lack of natural
resources, China has no such problems. Given its large domestic market,
losing the US as a major customer is not a disaster for China, and can
be compensated through more dynamic economic activities at home. China
can also make up for being freezed out of technological exchanges by
turning to indigenous innovation. As for the US, it can import goods
from other developing countries, albeit less cheaply. The relative loss
is acceptable when weighed against the heightened perception of economic
independence and security. [Third, the ideological confrontation between
China and the US is **less intense**]{.underline} than that during the
Cold War. Unlike the obsession with ideology in those days, [the line
between capitalism and socialism is **blurred** today. The **market
economy** has become **universally recognised** as the best way to
promote economic growth]{.underline} and, politically, many countries
have embraced democracy. Even North Korea calls itself the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. Although ideological hawks in the US still
long for the day when the beacon of freedom will light up the world,
[after **many years** of fighting **bloody wars overseas**, most
American people are **not interested** in promoting democracy
abroad]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [China just wants to **preserve its
political system** and has **no interest in exporting it** to other
countries, as the Soviet Union did. Thus, ideological **antagonism** in
China-US relations can easily be **eased** by calculations of realistic
**interests**, which create conditions for **compromise and
cooperation**. **Fourth**, both China and the US have **many options
other than war** to achieve their policy goals]{.underline}. While they
have no allies to serve as a buffer, given the nature of the potential
conflict in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, [both countries are
**adept at operating in grey zones** and fighting psychological, public
opinion or diplomatic warfare **below the threshold of
war**]{.underline}. The forced closure of the Chinese consulate in
Houston by the US government is just the latest act of brinkmanship. In
addition, [given China's huge economic and financial interests in the
US, the latter can **wield the stick of sanctions** when use of force is
**highly risky** or not worth it.]{.underline} [When both sides have
**many tools and options,** why would they **rush to war** to achieve
their goals? **Last**]{.underline} but not least, [the **imbalance of
power** will act as a deterrent]{.underline}. Some say the US and Soviet
Union did not fight a hot war because they were evenly matched. It was
not the case, actually. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet
Union was at a relative military disadvantage. Moreover, [a country
needs the **will to fight** before **going to war,** even if it is
stronger militarily than its adversary. Having fought **years of
meaningless wars**, the US is **weary of war**]{.underline}. [China,
too, **abhors war**. Having a **clear understanding** of US strength,
**especially** when its own economy is **slowing down** and it is facing
**various domestic challenges**]{.underline}, [China would **not wish**
to **recklessly start a war with the US**. In summary, the possibility
of a **hot war** between China and the US is **very
small**]{.underline}. The greatest danger for China is not a cold or hot
confrontation with the US, but policymakers' interpretation of the
momentary hostility towards Beijing of a portion of the American
population and the larger world. An erroneous interpretation could end
China's march to further opening up, and see it turn instead towards
self-isolation.

• Opportunity cost #5: Two decades of military conflict have eroded U.S.
military readiness. [While the U.S. military has global
responsibilities, it has finite resources, and nothing drains U.S.
military readiness like an active war]{.underline}, as made clear by the
2017 report of a Task Force on Defense Personnel co-chaired by former
U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and former National Security
Adviser James Jones.39 For the Pentagon, [prosecuting]{.underline} the
[war]{.underline} in Afghanistan [is a top-level priority that
**requires significant time** from its top officials as well as
tremendous resources]{.underline}---[from regular rotations of thousands
of personnel to equipment to budget expenditures]{.underline}. [With
pressing needs to bolster U.S. force posture in Asia and Europe to deter
threats from Russia and China]{.underline} and adapt the military to
emerging threats such as cybersecurity, [the U.S. military will have a
difficult time dedicating the necessary attention and resources to these
threats while **fighting an indefinite war**]{.underline} with roughly
14,000 troops in Afghanistan.
