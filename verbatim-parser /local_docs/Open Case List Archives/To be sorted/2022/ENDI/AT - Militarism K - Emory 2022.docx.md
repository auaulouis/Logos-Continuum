Commenting on the 'philosophical turn' in IR, Wæver remarks that '\[a\]
frenzy for [words like "**epistemology" and "ontology**" often signals
this philosophical turn']{.underline}, although he goes on to comment
that these terms are often used loosely.4 However, loosely deployed or
not, it is clear that [debates concerning ontology and epistemology play
a central role in the contemporary IR theory wars]{.underline}. In one
respect, this is unsurprising since it is a characteristic feature of
the social sciences that periods of disciplinary disorientation involve
recourse to reflection on the philosophical commitments of different
theoretical approaches, and there is no doubt that such reflection can
play a valuable role in making explicit the commitments that
characterise (and help individuate) diverse theoretical positions. Yet,
**[such a philosophical turn is not without its dangers]{.underline}**
and I will briefly mention three before turning to consider a confusion
that has, I will suggest, helped to promote the IR theory wars by
motivating this philosophical turn. [The first danger with the
philosophical turn is that it has an inbuilt tendency to **prioritise
issues** of ontology and epistemology]{.underline} over explanatory
and/or interpretive power as if the latter two were merely a simple
function of the former. But [while the explanatory and/or interpretive
power of a theoretical account is not wholly independent of its
ontological and/or epistemological commitments]{.underline} (otherwise
criticism of these features would not be a criticism that had any
value), [it is by no means clear that it is, in contrast, wholly
dependent on these philosophical commitments. Thus]{.underline}, for
example, [one **need not be sympathetic** to rational choice theory to
recognise that it **can provide powerful accounts of certain kinds of
problems**]{.underline}, such as the tragedy of the commons in which
dilemmas of collective action are foregrounded. [It may, of course, be
the case that the advocates of rational choice theory cannot give a good
account of why this type of theory is powerful in accounting for this
class of problems]{.underline} (i.e., how it is that the relevant actors
come to exhibit features in these circumstances that approximate the
assumptions of rational choice theory) and, if this is the case, it is a
philosophical weakness---[but **this does not undermine the point that,
for a certain class of problems, rational choice theory may provide the
best account available to us**]{.underline}. In other words, [while the
critical judgement of theoretical accounts in terms of their ontological
and/or epistemological sophistication is one kind of critical judgement,
**it is not the only or even necessarily the most important kind**. The
second danger]{.underline} run by the philosophical turn [is that
because prioritisation of ontology and epistemology promotes
theory-construction from philosophical first principles, **it cultivates
a theory-driven rather than problem-driven approach**]{.underline} to
IR. Paraphrasing Ian Shapiro, the point can be put like this: since it
is the case that there is always a plurality of possible true
descriptions of a given action, event or phenomenon, the challenge is to
decide which is the most apt in terms of getting a perspicuous grip on
the action, event or phenomenon in question given the purposes of the
inquiry; yet, from this standpoint, 'theory-driven work is part of a
reductionist program' in that it 'dictates always opting for the
description that calls for the explanation that flows from the preferred
model or theory'.5 [The justification offered for this strategy rests on
the mistaken belief that it is necessary for social science because
general explanations are required to characterise the classes of
phenomena studied in similar terms. However]{.underline}, as Shapiro
points out, [this is to misunderstand the enterprise of science since
'whether there are general explanations for classes of phenomena is a
question for social-scientific inquiry, **not to be prejudged before
conducting that inquiry'**]{.underline}.6 Moreover, [this strategy
easily slips into the promotion of the pursuit of **generality over that
of empirical validity**. The third danger is that the preceding two
combine to encourage the formation of a particular image of disciplinary
debate in IR]{.underline}---what might be called (only slightly tongue
in cheek) 'the Highlander view'---namely, [an image of warring
theoretical approaches with each]{.underline}, despite occasional
temporary tactical alliances, [dedicated to the strategic achievement of
sovereignty over the disciplinary field. It encourages this view because
the turn to, and **prioritisation of, ontology and epistemology**
stimulates the idea that there can only be one theoretical
approach]{.underline} which gets things right, namely, the theoretical
approach that gets its ontology and epistemology right. [This image
feeds back into IR exacerbating the first and second dangers, and so a
potentially **vicious circle arises.**]{.underline}

Genealogy, biopolitics, and the liberal peace

In the lecture series immediately following Security, Territory,
Population, namely The Birth of Biopolitics, Foucault (2008) more
narrowly focused on the shift from classically liberal to neoliberal
forms of government emerging in the 1930s and growing in the 1950s, and
how neoliberal governmentality worked by shaping subjectivity according
to neoliberal economic imperatives (Foucault, 2008).
[[Foucault's]{.mark} preoccupation with
[biopolitics]{.mark}]{.underline}, understood as a general shift in
modern liberal rule away from territory to population and life, has also
[[inspired]{.mark} a number of IR scholars]{.underline}. Michael
**[[Dillon]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Julian Reid,
[**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} Brad **[[Evans]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
for instance, have [examined the violent propensities inherent in
liberalism, committed to a global war in the name of life
itself]{.underline} (e.g. **[Dillon]{.underline}** and Reid, 2009;
**[Evans]{.underline}**, 2010, 2011; Reid, 2006). Genealogy, understood
as a form of critique played less of a role in the writings of Dillon
and Reid, in part perhaps since Foucault was only one of many sources of
inspiration for their writings. [[In]{.mark} Evans']{.underline} more
[programmatic [writings on]{.mark} Foucault and **[liberal
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, [[the genealogical
commitments]{.mark} reminiscent of the first generation of
post-structuralists [clearly surface]{.mark}. In laying out the "liberal
war thesis," Evans explains,]{.underline}

> Norms as such appear to be the logical outcome of reasoned political
> settlement. Our discourse of battle, however, appreciates that power
> defines the norm such that those who deviate from it pose a threat to
> the biological heritage of life. The norm is another way of
> suppressing political differences. There are then no universal,
> all-embracing, value-neutral, timeless, or eternal a priori norms that
> inhibit some purified and objective existential space where they await
> access by the learned justices of the peace. There is no absolute
> convergence point to human reason. [Every norm is simply the outcome
> of a particular power struggle]{.underline}. (Evans, 2011: 751, and
> see Evans, 2010: 424)

A similar imagery is found in Vivienne [Jabri's]{.underline} (2010)
[biopolitical critique of the liberal peace project]{.underline}, which
[draws out the genealogical critique to issues of vital significance in
IR]{.underline}, in particular the possibility of establishing a lasting
global peace underpinned by international institutions, law, and norms.
Since Jabri forcefully draws out the empirical implications of the
genealogical disposition, her text warrants a closer examination.1 The
liberal peace project, as is well known in IR, aims at promoting basic
liberal values, such as the rule of law, the protection of human rights,
and the establishment of democratic institutions worldwide. Jabri
locates the origins of the renewed interventionist thought in former
United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's Agenda for
Peace from 1992, when absolute sovereignty was put into question
following the end of the Cold War. To use Hedley Bull's (1977) famous
categories, the principle of Order understood as the unconditional
upholding of the principle of sovereignty hence disallowing any
(military) intervention, came to be challenged in the name of Justice,
understood as a global project of making the world a somewhat better
place. State sovereignty became increasingly conditional on the state's
ability to uphold basic human rights. Not only did liberals in IR
perceive of the end of the Cold War as providing an opportunity for a
global restructuring of relations between states (e.g. Kegley, 1993), in
which such a tilt from Order to Justice would be possible, so did
Frankfurt school oriented critical IR (e.g. Booth, 1991). Jabri then,
uncontroversially, regards the 1990s discourse on humanitarian
intervention, and the follow-up UN initiative from 2005 of a
Responsibility to Protect (R2P), as important articulations of the
liberal peace project.

Jabri's (2010) genealogical critique of the liberal peace project starts
from "the premise that to intervene at all in other societies is by
definition colonial, suggestive of dispossession, racialised domination,
and subjugation" (2010: 42). Thus, whether intervention takes the form
of conducting air strikes or the sending of "armies" of advisors on how
institutions best can uphold the rule of law, all forms of intervention
is by definition illegitimate, since "the other" is deemed as
irrevocably other and different from the "Western liberal self," whose
capacity for self-determination should not be violated. What Jabri wants
to cast into doubt is the self-understanding of the liberal peace
project as one of "rescue," "care," and "protection" that denies the
"violence" inherent in the liberal peace project (2010: 42, 48). Jabri
repudiates this benevolent understanding and instead proposes that the
liberal peace project is "a project of war" which is primarily and
ultimately driven by a biopolitical desire to manage populations. At the
end of the day, Jabri asserts, the liberal peace project amounts to
little more than a continuation of Western imperialism, thus a war
against the other, fought in the name of humanity, and like the colonial
European project aiming at the "management of populations through
governmentality" (2010: 53, 54). To that end, the liberal project
employs the twin pillars of, on the one hand, "military and carceral
power" in the form of various police missions, and, on the other hand,
"pedagogical power" as other forms of aid in constructing democratic
institutions (2010: 54). Both forms of exercise of power though, partake
in Euro-Western neo-colonialism.

In support of her thesis of the liberal peace project as one of war,
Jabri's argument rests on two particularizing moves with clear
genealogical underpinnings. First, "the state" that the liberal peace
project wishes to strengthen is seen as a Euro-Western way of organizing
political life, ill-suited and alien to non-Western localities, and is
thus to be understood as an imposition. Second and more importantly,
"the human" which the liberal peace project seeks to protect is but one
rendition of what the human may mean and ultimately resting upon a
Kantian notion of "the autonomous rational individual" originating in
the European Enlightenment (2010: 45). "The human" that the liberal
peace project seeks to protect, Jabri notes, is not understood as "an
empty space," which can be endlessly filled with various articulations,
but as an autonomous decision-maker, precisely the subject protected and
thus conjured up in discourses of human rights (2010: 47). The force
that is used in the liberal peace project (and any intervention in its
name) is thus premised on a particular understanding of the human. Jabri
contrasts this "rational subject" to a cultural subject; the "cultural"
as she uses it then stands in for that which is beyond the grasp of
Western liberal reason (2010: 47). She further notes that "the
epistemological and ontological underpinning of the liberal peace
project is precisely based upon a rationalist construction that is
universal in its articulation" and "aims to shape societies so that they
become self-governing entities within distinctly liberal lines" (2010:
47, 48). So, her main criticism is that the liberal peace project is
premised upon and thereby constitutive of a particular subjectivity,
namely the European liberal self, that now seeks to universalize itself.
The liberal peace project places this subject in a position of hierarchy
over non-liberal conceptions of self and society, and imposes it upon
other localities from "the outside" (2010: 55). In so doing, it
disallows other articulations of subjectivity and is hence understood as
a form of violence even if not undertaken by military means.

The kernel of critique in the arguments examined ranging from the first
generation post-structuralists to the later generation of Foucauldian
scholars inspired by governmentality and biopolitics lies in the
assumption that an alleged universal is nothing but a particular in
disguise, which has forgotten, repressed, or refused its particularity,
and in the claim to being or representing the universal does violence to
various others. The assumption of conflicting particularities, which is
pre-methodological and not inductively derived from the empirical work
itself, is reflective of the ontological assumptions of genealogy
conceived as a form of critique. To better understand what is at stake
in making this assumption and ultimately being able to assume a critical
distance to it, we need to turn to Foucault's genealogical phase, which
immediately preceded his writings on governmentality and biopolitics.

Foucault, genealogy, and critique

It should from the outset be clarified that my object of interrogation
is not Foucault's oeuvre as a whole but rather narrowly his genealogical
phase, from his Nietzsche, Genealogy, History which appeared in print in
1971, until his lecture course "Society Must Be Defended" in 1975--1976.
Some interpreters of Foucault have suggested that he abandoned the
genealogical stance, in part due to the problems that I will raise here
(e.g. Dean, 2010: 58; Lemke, 2012: 11--12). Mitchell Dean (2010), for
instance, noticed that Foucault's genealogical project of thinking
social relations in the vocabulary of war, violence, and battle "found
itself uncomfortably close to a position that tended to identify all
forms of power with domination." (2010: 58). No doubt, after "Society
Must Be Defended" Foucault's vocabulary changed from war, combat, and
violence, to governance, governmentality, and conduct (Walters, 2012:
16). Foucault may in fact never fully have embraced the genealogical
disposition himself. The critique that I advance is therefore not
necessarily aimed at Foucault himself. Moreover, I shall not venture
into the difficult debate on the extent to which Foucault was finally
able to keep relations of power, violence, and domination analytically
apart, but simply note that such questions were pressing concerns until
the very end of his life (for a critical view, see Hanssen, 2000:
148--157). In what follows, I reconstruct the genealogical disposition,
which Foucault elaborated in close dialogue with Nietzsche.

In Nietzsche, Genealogy, History, Foucault offers a reading of
Nietzsche's genealogy, while also laying bare his own philosophical
commitments. The importance of the piece can hardly be exaggerated for
understanding Foucault's project (cf. Rabinow, 1984: 76). These
commitments were to guide the only full-fledged genealogical work
Foucault wrote, Discipline and Punish (Foucault, 1995 \[1975\]) as well
as his second genealogical work, the first part of the History of
Sexuality (Foucault, 1990 \[1976\]). To reiterate, genealogy appears
less as a method in the sense of a set of rules that the researcher
applies onto a historical material, but more as an ethos, a certain
critical disposition. To begin with, genealogy opposes itself to the
search for origins, since such a search "assumes the existence of
immobile forms that precede the external world of accident and
succession" (Foucault, 1984 \[1971\]: 78). In other words, the
genealogist, along with Nietzsche, rejects substance ontology, where
entities exist as already fully formed self-identical, monads. Instead
he or she embraces an ontology of forces in perpetual movement and
becoming without a telos (Schrift, 1996). Whereas a traditional
historian seeks to trace "the beginning," understood as uncovering some
pure state of things, the genealogist, on the other hand, finds only
"the dissension of other things" and "disparity" (Foucault, 1984
\[1971\]: 79). In this context, the genealogist will seek to "cultivate
the details and accidents that accompany every beginning; it will be
scrupulously attentive to their petty malice; it will await their
emergence, once unmasked, as the face of the other" (1984 \[1971\]: 80).
Thus, the genealogist subscribes to what Milbank refers to as a
differential ontology where all identities are to be methodically
disaggregated to demonstrate the estranged nature of identity (Milbank,
2006: 278--326). As Foucault (1984 \[1971\]) summarizes such a
commitment, "history will not discover a forgotten identity, eager to be
reborn, but a complex system of distinct and multiple elements, unable
to be mastered by the powers of synthesis" (1984 \[1971\]: 94).

Furthermore, the genealogist refuses to see historical would be
identities as teleologically predetermined. He or she instead discovers
that "truth or being does not lie at the root of what we know and what
we are, but the exteriority of accidents" (1984 \[1971\]: 81). The
genealogist therefore does not treat emergence as a surface
manifestation of a deep principle or essence realizing itself in history
as coming into being where the endpoint of the movement is already
immanent to the event itself. Contrasting the teleological disposition
to the genealogical, Foucault (1984 \[1971\]) writes that whereas the
former "would convince us of an obscure purpose that seeks its
realization at the moment it arises \[the latter\] seeks to reestablish
the various systems of subjection: not the anticipatory power of
meaning, but the hazardous play of domination" (1984 \[1971\]: 83).
Thus, the genealogist refuses the Aristotelian binary of essence and
accident, in which a deep essence gradually comes to the surface, and if
it is not doing so, it is due to contingent accidents, a theoretical
figure which informs both liberal progressivism and Marxism. And
history, in the genealogist's understanding, is not the sum total of
teleological or dialectical movements in which elements or forces are
being reconciled. This would presuppose a principle of unity or
intelligibility outside and beyond itself, which time makes present onto
itself. To sum up, instead of reading history as progressive shifts
according to a profound logic where the essence or telos of history
realizes itself in surface manifestations that the philosopher
deciphers, for the genealogist there is literally nothing "underneath"
or "beyond" the contingent play of forces (Dreyfus and Rabinow, 1983:
104--118).

Drawing on Nietzsche's notion of active and reactive forces, Foucault
(1984 \[1971\]) understands emergence as "the entry of forces,"
comprehended as a clash and confrontation between forces, which "do not
belong to a common space" (1984 \[1971\]: 84--85). Thus, "in a sense,
only a single drama is ever staged in this 'non-place', the endlessly
repeated play of dominations" (1984 \[1971\]:85). How are we then to
understand the emergence of this space of "non-place"? Such a space does
not exist prior to the clash of forces; it is rather the battle itself
which clears and opens it, and indeed the battle perpetually enacts a
movement of clearing such a space (Dreyfus and Rabinow, 1983: 109).
However, the relationship between forces is not a real
"relationship"---since the forces have nothing in common---only an
endless clash. And the place where this encounter occurs is not really a
"place" at all, but an "inaccessible, impalpable, yet enabling non
space." The domination is therefore manifested throughout all of history
"in meticulous procedures that impose rights and obligations" on some
over others (Foucault, 1984 \[1971\]: 85; Hanssen, 2000: 46). This
primordial endless clash of forces where "the strong" dominates "the
weak" in a myriad of configurations provides the following rendition in
which this relationship of domination, "makes itself accountable for
debts and gives rise to the universe of rules, which is by no means
designed to temper violence, but rather to satisfy it" (1984 \[1971\]:
85).

The clash of forces that constitutes this perpetual battle, it should be
emphasized, is not a surface phenomenon which masks a deeper reality: it
is literally all there is. Thus, at the beginning of every
spatiotemporal order lies domination upheld by violence. This clash
gives rise to the emergence of a "structured field of forces," in which
the battle continues in the rituals of power, inscribed in codes of
conduct, in norms, values, traditions, and laws (Dreyfus and Rabinow,
1983: 110). The law and the norm that are presented as domesticating
struggle and redressing injustices, are nothing more than temporary
inscriptions of a relationship of domination. It should finally be made
clear that power-as-forces stand in hierarchical relations of
domination. After temporary ruptures in the structure of dominations,
new structures of dominations emerge. A balance-of-power type of rough
equilibrium between forces will not last (Hanssen, 2000: 97--157; and
see Coole, 2000: 119--121).

In Truth and Juridical Forms, a lecture series given in Rio in May 1973,
Foucault returns to Nietzsche when further elaborating on the
possibilities of writing a historical rather than philosophical
understanding of the subject. He emphasizes the radical break enacted
between the activity of knowing and the supposed object of that
knowledge. Instead of being a relation in which knowledge, so to speak,
hooks onto the world, "\[k\]nowledge must struggle against a world
without order, without connectedness, without form, without beauty,
without wisdom, without harmony, and without law." The relation between
knowledge and the world to be known may "only be a relation of violence,
domination, power, and force, a relation of violation" (Foucault, 2003
\[1973\]: 9). Foucault credits Nietzsche for breaking with the
previously assumed harmonious relationship between knowledge and world,
in which God ultimately stands as the underwriter of such as relation.
Western philosophy, Foucault asserts, from Plato through Descartes and
culminating in Kant, has always "characterized knowledge ... by
resemblance, by congruence, by bliss, by unity" (2003 \[1973\]: 12).
This assumption of thinking in terms of "congruence, love, unity, and
pacification" in fact makes the philosopher the person who is most
likely to get things wrong since "\[o\]ne can understand what knowledge
consists of only by examining these relations of struggle and power, the
manner in which things and men hate one another, fight one another, and
try to dominate one another, to exercise power relations over one
another" (2003 \[1973\]: 12). The philosopher's categories of unity,
correspondence, truth, reason, and love only work to obscure the endless
violent impositions of power-as-forces.

The genealogical ethos, as so far presented, occupies a central but
ambiguous position in Foucault's later work. On the one hand, the
genealogical ethos is precisely what remains when his historicism is
shed. In that sense, it seems entirely justified to describe it as an
ontology (Oksala, 2012: 18--19). On the other hand, to talk about a
Foucauldian ontology may appear self-contradictory since Foucault (2003
\[1975--1976\]) seeks to thoroughly historicize ontology and comes very
close to a complete embrace of historicism (2003 \[1975--1976\]:
172--173). Foucault's differential ontology of struggle, conflict, and
violence must itself, in accordance with the historicist displacement of
ontology, have a history. Ontology, on Foucault's genealogical
understanding, can, as Johanna Oksala notes (2012), be nothing but "a
politics which has forgotten itself," since every order is nothing but a
temporary stabilization of clashing power-as-forces (2012: 35).

In his lecture course at Collège de France in 1975--1976, "Society Must
Be Defended," Foucault traces the contingent emergence of the
genealogical ethos which enables him to undertake such a genealogy in
the first place. In the course of the lecture series, Foucault expands
on the genealogical ethos, delineated in Nietzsche, Genealogy, and
History, and Truth and Juridical Forms, by historically tracing the
emergence of the conditions that make such an understanding of history
possible. Foucault (2003 \[1975--1976\]) devotes the majority of his
lectures to tracing the emergence of a hypothesis, namely the hypothesis
that, inverting Clausewitz's famous dictum, politics is the continuation
of war with other means (2003 \[1975--1976\]: 15). This is indeed the
logical conclusion of the genealogical ethos that he, up to this point,
only established "philosophically" through Nietzsche. This hypothesis,
which he appropriately refers to as "Nietzsche's hypothesis" entails
that "\[i\]f we look beneath peace, order, wealth, and authority,
beneath the claim order of subordinations, beneath the State and State
apparatuses, beneath the laws, and so on, will we hear and discover a
sort of primitive and permanent war?" (2003 \[1975--1976\]: 46--47). It
is, throughout the lecture series, made clear that this is a discourse
with which he sympathizes a great deal (e.g. 2003 \[1975--1976\]: 65,
111, 173; and see Hoffman, 2007: 769--771).

There is, as Johanna Oksala (2012) writes in her recent book on Foucault
and violence, often a conflation of ontological or "symbolic" violence
and physical violence. She argues that even if we embrace the coding of
knowledge and representation of the world in terms of violence and
imposition---due to a fundamental disharmony between knowledge and
being---this does not necessarily lead to the embrace of the
ineradicability of physical violence. She writes that "the investigation
of the constitutive role of physical violence must be thoroughly
historical and must not rely on any ontologized notion of originary
violence as such," thus seeking to sever the link between the two
(Oksala, 2012: 37). But if we accept violence as ontologically
inscribed, we might also expect physical violence to follow suit, and
the distinction becomes merely one of quantity rather than quality.
Hanssen (2000) makes this point when she writes,

> \[g\]ranted in Deleuzean style, Foucault adopted a nonphysical
> conception of force, which referred to a differential process of
> "evenementality" rather than advocating real, naturalistic combat ...
> the problem still remained that Foucault did glean the differential
> play of forces and politics of difference from the real bloody tussle
> of armed struggle. (2000: 137)

Quite clearly, the distinction between ontological and physical violence
cannot be so easily upheld. In the genealogical Foucault, the basic
problem is his insistence on the tendency of wills to power always to
turn into relations of violent domination.

Genealogy and the hermeneutics of baseless suspicion

[[How may we]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[understand the **suspicion** to
anything]{.mark} common, shared, and [universal]{.mark} that genealogy
is closely linked to and that we find [in IR]{.mark}
scholarship]{.underline} informed by genealogy? To be able to assume a
critical distance from genealogy as a form of critique, it is important
to realize that [the genealogical ontology of violence is but one
option, no more and no less grounded than ontologies which refuse
violence as foundational]{.underline}. In this penultimate section, I
unravel the Nietzschean backdrop to Foucault's genealogy and briefly
contrast the genealogical ontology of violence with one which refuses
violence as foundational by turning to the work of John Milbank.

Paul [Ricoeur]{.underline} (1970) once [referred to Marx, Nietzsche, and
Freud as the "**masters of suspicion**."]{.underline} Instead of taking
surface phenomena such as discourse, culture, or subjective experience
at face value, the "masters of suspicion" sought an underlying
phenomenon which would in turn situate and explain this discourse,
culture, or experience. For Marx, the ideas, values, and culture of a
society would of course ultimately be "conditioned" by the economic
base, and at the end of the day shown to be working toward perpetuating
the interests of a particular class. For Freud, various types of
behavioral neurosis could be explained by reference to an underlying
repressed unconscious, which the psychoanalyst would help "bring to the
surface," and make the patient aware of, in the process of
psychoanalysis. Nietzsche, however, became for Foucault in his
genealogical phase, as Milbank (2006) puts it, "the only true master of
suspicion" (2006: 278). Nietzsche's suspicion, which Foucault takes over
and expands on, lies in that all truth claims can be unmasked and
exposed as nothing but manifestations of underlying wills to power.
Foucault rejects the metaphoric of surface/depth, since the clash of
wills to power goes on in the everyday activities of life. There is no
deep structure "beyond" or "behind" this clash. However, in another
sense, there is still a surface/depth binary at work, which harks back
to Foucault's Nietzschean understanding of a primordial clash in the
"non-place" of emergence of forces. As Foucault puts it in a
Zarathustra-like pronouncement, commenting on his affinities with the
other French neo-Nietzscheans Deleuze, Lyotard, and Guattari, "I would
say that we try to bring to light what has remained until now the most
hidden, the most occulted, the most deeply invested experience in the
history of our culture---power relations." The "hidden truth" which
Foucault (2003 \[1973\]) wants to "bring to light" is precisely that
power relations "permeate the whole fabric of our existence" (2003
\[1973\]: 17).

"The political question," as Foucault (2003 \[1973\]) puts it, before
asserting "the importance of Nietzsche," is not about "error, illusion,
alienated consciousness, or ideology; it is truth itself" (2003
\[1973\]: 75). But [a number of [problems with this view]{.mark} of
politics as conflict always tending to violence and domination as
foundational to the human condition [immediately present
themselves]{.mark}. When all gestures to what is common have been
exposed as expressions of partial wills to power, and [when the **ethos
of** ]{.mark}**baseless [suspicion has been
unleashed]{.mark}**]{.underline} and revealed all ideals, values, laws,
and norms, as partial and biased, [does that mean that human life has
become more truthful, as arriving at the realization of the "reality" of
this ontologized state of primordial clashes? On [Foucault's]{.mark} own
ontology, "Nietzsche's [hypothesis" would itself have to
be]{.mark}]{.underline} unmasked as yet another contender among many to
capture the final truth about the human condition, and shown to mask
[[a]{.mark} partial [will to power]{.mark}]{.underline} (Milbank, 2006:
282; Oksala, 2012: 27). [If one deploys the genealogical suspicion onto
the genealogical disposition itself, it is revealed as but one option
among others.]{.underline}

Reading the genealogical ethos as expressing a distinctive
(anti)theological core, one may, with Milbank (2006), ask whether the
Nietzschean suspicion that Foucault takes over "is the final and truly
non-metaphysical mode of secular reason, or else itself embodies an
ontology of power and conflict which is simply another mythos" (2006:
2). One may also follow Milbank in his suggestion that secular discourse
of which he reads post-Nietzschean genealogy as a radical exponent of
emerged out of an active rejection of some of Christianity's core
teachings. Foucault (2003 \[1975--1976\]) articulates this rejection
when he refers to genealogy as

> the very opposite of those traditional analyses that try to find
> beneath the apparent or superficial confusion, beneath the visible
> brutality and passions, a basic rationality which is both permanent
> and related, by its very essence, to the just and the good. (2003
> \[1975--1976\]: 269)

However, in classical Thomist Christianity, difference does not have to
be suppressed, reduced, or subsumed in any kind of dialectical movement.
Thus, in contrast to Foucault's genealogy, "\[p\]eace no longer depends
upon the reduction to the self-identical, but is the sociality of
harmonious difference. Violence, by contrast, is always a secondary
willed intrusion upon this possible infinite order" (Milbank, 2006: 6).

Once one realizes that the ontology of violence is no more than one
possible mythos, one can put forward "an alternative mythos, equally
unfounded, but nonetheless embodying an 'ontology of peace', which
conceives differences as analogically related, rather than equivocally
at variance" (Milbank, 2006: 279). On the one hand, the reading that
Milbank proposes affirms what we find in genealogy, namely "the
reduction of substance to transition." On the other hand, such a reading
"questions the transcendental reading of transition as conflict"
(Milbank, 2006: 298). So while Milbank retains a differential ontology,
he questions whether the elements would have to relate to one another
arbitrarily and violently. Milbank puts the crux of the issue thus,

> The question of the possibility of living together in mutual
> agreement, and the question of whether there can be a charitable act,
> \[...\] turn out to be conjointly the question of whether there can be
> an "analogy" or a "common measure" between differences which does not
> reduce differences to mere instances of a common essence or genus. In
> other words a likeness that only maintains itself through the
> differences, and not despite nor in addition to them. (Milbank, 2006:
> 290)

The point is not necessarily that IR scholarship should embrace
Milbank's alternative vision, but rather to make clear that [[the
genealogical rendition is]{.mark} but one option, [no more]{.mark} and
no less [grounded than ontologies which **refuse violence as
foundational**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Conclusion

This article has examined genealogy as a form of critique in IR. The
first part of the article demonstrated that Foucault's genealogy was an
important component in the work of the first generation of
post-structuralist IR as well as in contemporary scholarship informed by
frameworks of governmentality and biopolitics. It was shown that [when
genealogy is understood as critique, violence risks being inscribed as
foundational to global political life]{.underline}. However, despite the
fact that it is virtually impossible to understand the meaning of
"critical" in this work without a grasp of genealogy, [the assumptions
of genealogy have been insufficiently engaged]{.underline}. To rectify
this, the second part of the article critically examined the
philosophical underpinnings of genealogy. [Through a close reading
of]{.underline} three core texts where [Foucault]{.underline} grapples
with genealogy, [it was shown that [genealogy **relies on an ontology of
forces**]{.mark}, which are postulated as arbitrarily [and]{.mark}
violently related. Genealogy therefore [tends to **inscribe violence as
foundational**]{.mark}]{.underline} to social relations. It was further
noted that [genealogically informed critique brings a peculiar form of
**suspicion**]{.underline} to all that is presented as common, shared,
and universal. This suspicion was traced back to Nietzsche and
characterized as "baseless," which again reflects a set of particular
ontological commitments idiosyncratic to genealogy. [These
commitments]{.underline}, which inscribe violence as foundational,
[were]{.underline} finally [contrasted to an ontology which]{.underline}
follows the genealogical understanding of emergent forces, but [refuses
the assumption of them as arbitrarily and violently
related.]{.underline}

Finally, [what are the implications for empirical Foucauldian
work]{.underline} for the argument I have pursued in the article? In
empirical [[work informed by governmentality and biopolitics]{.mark}, IR
scholars often examine the encounter between Western and non-Western
countries]{.underline}. The problem to which I ultimately want to draw
attention is not that such scholarship is often critical of military
intervention undertaken by Western powers. On the contrary, it is
important to bring out and critically scrutinize the paternalistic and
indeed hierarchical renditions that no doubt are common in, for
instance, the liberal peace project (e.g. Richmond, 2011). [The problem
is]{.underline} rather [that the genealogical ethos [risks turning into
a]{.mark} global **[interpretive disposition]{.mark}**, with which all
global [interactions]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}by whatever means
[[are made **a priori suspect**. Instead of seeking]{.mark} to engage in
a careful **[empirical consideration]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
merits of forms of intervention in each case, [[the generalized]{.mark}
genealogical [suspicion **disables** ]{.mark}**any [other
understanding]{.mark} of global political life** than]{.underline} a
ceaseless unfolding drama of clashing **[wills to
dominate]{.underline}** and conquer. Since [the liberal
project]{.underline} is exposed as just a particular will to power, it
[must inscribe a relation of violent hierarchy to non-Western
localities]{.underline}, as opposed to an understanding of similar and
harmoniously overlapping subjectivities already existing in those
places. [On such a pre-methodological genealogical disposition,
intervention becomes suspicious in whatever form it may
take]{.underline}. Whether it is in the form of peacekeeping troops or
rule of law advisors assisting local actors in security sector reform,
any involvement can only be read as a manifestation of "the West's"
ongoing will to colonize and impose its will on others.

The genealogical disposition easily lends itself to an assertion of
incommensurability, more often than not coded in terms of "culture,"
since the clashing wills to power in Foucault's ontology of emergence do
not belong to a common space; they have nothing in common. [[What is
made **suspect**]{.mark} to the extent of disabled [is]{.mark} genuine
**social [learning]{.mark} through communication**]{.underline}, which
presupposes that different sociocultural settings may display profound
similarities of aspirations of what is desired. For instance, [holding
out the possibility that whatever goes under the label of human rights,
and especially its minimalist rendition of what human means, is
compatible with a range of walks and ways, may harmoniously blend with,
and may resonate with many traditions around the world is perhaps the
ultimate hope on which the liberal peace project rests]{.underline}
(e.g. Moyn, 2010). [This [hope]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[is
disabled by a]{.mark} peculiar form of [genealogical faith which **lures
the researcher to interpret all**]{.mark}]{.underline} human
**[[interaction as]{.mark} disguising a ceaseless and primordial clash
of]{.underline}** wills to **[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Following the argument pursued in this article, one needs to realize
that the genealogical disposition is reflective of certain ontological
assumptions which are but one option. Empirical work in IR informed by
governmentality frameworks is no doubt valuable in that such work opens
up for a much more extensive power analysis than approaches that reify
state actors as the only relevant actors in global politics. Moreover,
Foucault's writings on biopolitics have served as a starting point for
examining what happens when life rather than territory become the object
of rule, thus broadening the traditional focus in IR to include
geopolitics and biopolitics (e.g. Vaughan-Williams, 2015). However,
[when conducting empirical work in such traditions, [it is important to
**refrain from reading an ontology of violence into** ]{.mark}**the
[empirical analyses]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or at the very least,
reflect on the ethico-political stakes involved in doing so.

[This article seeks to forward an alternative framework]{.underline} and
to question the use of the 'liberal peace' rubric to describe and
analyse post-conflict and international statebuilding interventions in
the post-Cold War period. It will be argued that [the critique of
liberal peace bears much less relation to policy practice than might be
assumed by the **critical**]{.underline} (radical and policy)
[**discourses** and, in fact, appears to **inverse the relationship**
between the critique of the liberal peace and the dominant policy
assumptions. The shared desire to critique the liberal peace leads to a
set of assumptions and **one-sided representations** that portray
Western policy interventions as **too liberal: too fixated on Western
models**]{.underline} and too keen to allow **[democratic freedoms
and]{.underline}** market **[autonomy]{.underline}**. It will be
explained here that [this view of 'liberal' interventions transforming
post-conflict societies through 'immediate' liberalisation]{.underline}
and 'rapid democratization and marketization' **[is a self-serving and
fictional policy narrative]{.underline}**.5 [This narrative fiction
is]{.underline} then [used, in the frameworks of **policy orientated
critiques**]{.underline}, as the basis upon which to reflect upon
Western policy and to limit policy expectations (while often extending
regulatory controls) on the basis that the aspirations of external
interveners were too ambitious, too interventionist, and too 'liberal'
for the states and societies which were the subject of intervention.

[It is **unfortunate** that this policy narrative can **appear to be
given support**]{.underline} by more radical critiques of post-Cold War
intervention, similarly framed through the critique of liberal peace.
For example, Oliver Richmond is not exceptional in re-reading the
catastrophe of the invasion and occupation of Iraq in terms of an
'attempt to mimic the liberal state', which has 'done much to discredit
the universal claims of the transferability of the liberal peace in
political terms'.6 Michael Barnett argues that 'liberal values' clearly
guide peacebuilding activities and that their 'explicit goal' is 'to
create a state defined by the rule of law, markets and democracy'.7
Beate Jahn has argued that 'the tragedy of liberal diplomacy' lies in
the ideological drive of liberalism, in which intervention is
intensified despite the counterproductive results.8
[**Foucaultian-inspired theorists, Michael Dillon** and Julian
Reid]{.underline}, similarly [reinforce the claims that the key
problematic of intervention is its **liberal nature**]{.underline} in
their [assertion that we are witnessing a liberal drive to **control and
to regulate the post-colonial world** on the behalf of]{.underline}
neo-liberal or **[biopolitical power]{.underline}**, seeking 'to
globalize the domesticating power of civil society mechanisms in a war
against all other modes of cultural forms'.9

[This view of a transformative drive to regulate]{.underline} and
control the post-colonial world on the basis of the liberal framings of
power and knowledge [**stands in stark contrast to the policy world**,
in which]{.underline}, by the end of the Cold War, leading [policy
institutions were]{.underline} already highly **[pessimistic of the
capacities of non-liberal subjects to cope with liberal
political]{.underline}**, economic and social forms and suspicious of
even East and Central European states coping with democracy and the
market, let alone those of sub-Saharan Africa. [Bringing the critique
back in relation with the policy practices seems to suggest that the
policy critics of the liberal peace offer succour and **consolation to
the policymakers** rather than critique]{.underline}. This leads to the
concern of this article that more [radical critiques of the liberal
peace may need to ensure that they **are not drawn into a framework in
which their critical intentions may be blunted**.]{.underline}

There are many different approaches taken to the critique of liberal
peace approaches and often authors do not clearly stake out their
methodological frameworks or develop a 'scattergun approach' using a
range of different critiques.10 Nevertheless, for heuristic purposes, it
will be useful to frame these diverse critiques within two broad,
distinctive, but often interconnected, approaches; which are here
categorised as the radical, '[power-based',]{.underline} and the more
policy orientated, 'ideas-based', [critiques]{.underline}. The former
approach tends to [see the discourse of liberal peace as an ideological
and instrumental one, arguing that the **rhetoric**]{.underline} of
freedom, markets and democracy [is merely a representation of Western
self-interest,]{.underline} which has little genuine concern for the
security and freedoms of those societies intervened in. The latter
approach suggests that rather than the concepts being misused, in the
discursive frameworks of the projection of Western power, the problem
lies less with power relations than with the universal conceptualising
of the liberal peace itself.

Ken **Booth 07**. IR @ Aberystwyth *Theory of World Security* p. 132-133

Daryl Glaser. a scholar from South Africa, and therefore somebody
directly familiar with life in a state that was once committed to
institutionalised racism, has offered an important counter to the Bauman
thesis and the simplistic interhnkinil by postmodern writers of the
Holocaust and modernimJ°\" In a book written a decade after Mandela\'s
release, Glaser argued that [it was **not the surveillance, statistics,
and regulation** that were the aspects of Nazi behaviour demanding
attention]{.underline}. [Nor was it the \'lawfulness, planning,
**bureaucratic regulation or the professionalisation** of knowledge\'
that fed into Nazi racial policies]{.underline}. That is, Glaser claimed
that the features of modernity showcased by the Bauman thesis were not
what demanded attention; [rather, it was the \'institutionalisation of a
racial hierarchy of wealth, status and power]{.underline}, enforced by
repressive, often arbitrary [state authority]{.underline}, assisted by
bad laws\'. [What was wrong in Nazi Germany]{.underline} (and in
apartheid South Africa) [was **not \'modernity\'**]{.underline}, but
[laws and politics that served ideas of racial superiority - a prejudice
that was directly contrary to \'modern ideals like social
justice\']{.underline}. [Modernity]{.underline} for Glaser [delivered
ideas of social justice to South Africa]{.underline}, while [its
modalities in the form of statistics and regulation]{.underline}, and so
on [constituted the]{.underline} very [means by which illiteracy could
be overcome, and the health of the disadvantaged improved.]{.underline}

Rejecting the logic and political implications of the Bauman thesis,
[Glaser advocated \'more and better law, **effectively enforced, and
more \"scientific\" information about the condition of the
people**]{.underline}, not less of these \"modern\" goods\'. His view
was that the people(s) of post- apartheid South Africa were in a better
position than in the recent past albeit still a perilous one, because
the oppressed had identified with modernity\'s ideas of tolerance and
equality, and had found solidarity in the global human rights
supporters. [Social development]{.underline} (improved literacy and
better health), he stressed, [requires planning, profession- alised
knowledge, and other modalities of modernity - **not their
rejection**.]{.underline} What Glaser called the \'organisational
machinery of \"modernity\" to give effect to \"modern\" ideas like
social justice\' 107 does not guarantee the security and hence prospects
for emancipation for South Africa\'s peoples, but it does give them
hope.105

The idea of progress is not what it was, but is more useful as a result.
It should never be considered as part of nature\'s plan for history, or
pursued with hubris, but always with reflexivity [The ideals of
emancipation that inform progressive politics are guides for judgement
and action; without them societies will **replicate
structural**]{.underline} and other **[oppressions]{.underline}**, and
humanity will never be what it might become.

Anastasia **Berg 20**. Junior research fellow in philosophy at the
University of Cambridge and an editor at The Point. This article is part
of The Point's Quarantine Journal. "Giorgio Agamben's Coronavirus
Cluelessness."
https://www.chronicle.com/article/Giorgio-Agamben-s/248306?key=z5yodZPXH1-Hi8hgwdp9akWH-jXrno6FVQZE24qkIFpuxgIOSVaMjuRtSAg7_lBhSjNkRkZwNTBOR1RVbUlDYWFwc0VzOU93TXZka2U1QVJRUkFwZGJhdElSbw&cid=wsinglestory_41_1&fbclid=IwAR3g67ghodcyGmnV3_q9OFqTKh83Hvn3DRUL2CuVNHUDBP1QN-L-Oo9yUvM

[Like a]{.underline} bemused [**Fox News anchor**, Agamben concludes
that travel bans, canceling]{.underline} public and private [events,
closing]{.underline} public and commercial [institutions, and enforcing
quarantine and surveillance are all simply \"disproportionate\": a cost
too high to pay]{.underline} to protect oneself from just one more
ordinary disease.

In a widely circulated response, the French philosopher
[Jean-Luc]{.underline} Nancy, who identifies Agamben as an \"old
friend,\" takes exception to Agamben's focus on government as the sole
culprit of the crisis, but concedes his general argument about the
perils of a perpetual state of panicked existence: \"an entire
civilization is involved, there is no doubt about it.\" Yet the most
noteworthy part of [Nancy's reply is]{.underline} its closing note:
\"[Almost thirty years ago doctors decided that I needed a heart
transplant. Giorgio]{.underline} was one of the very few who [advised me
not to listen to them. If I had followed his advice **I would have
probably died soon enough**. It is possible to make a
mistake]{.underline}.\"

Nancy is right: Mistakes can be made. But [is Agamben's dogmatic
skepticism toward institutional intervention]{.underline} of all kinds
[rightly classified as a mistake? Or has an intellectual habit become a
pathological compulsion?]{.underline} Either way, [Nancy's small
personal anecdote reveals **just what is at stake in
Agamben's**]{.underline} polemical pose, applied to the real [**world:
the life of loved ones**, especially the old and
vulnerable.]{.underline}

Not that Agamben would allow his old friend's words, not to mention the
devastation that has continued ravaging Italy, to rattle his confidence.
The deaths of hundreds of Italians per day seems only to have hardened
his resolve.

In his second piece, titled simply \"Clarifications,\" Agamben
graciously concedes that an epidemic is upon us, leaving behind the
misleading empirical claims. (Well, almost, and the exception is worth
noting: Agamben claims that \"There have been more serious epidemics in
the past, but no one ever thought for that reason to declare a state of
emergency like the current one, which prevents us even from moving.\"
This is false. As Agamben's intellectual godfather Michel Foucault
details in Discipline and Punish, as early as the 1600s, preparations
for the plague included the complete restriction of movement between and
within towns in Europe: \"Each individual is ﬁxed in his place. And, if
he moves, he does so at the risk of his life, contagion or
punishment.\") For the most part, Agamben focuses his clarification on
another, principled objection to the draconian measures implemented
across the world: How much sacrifice is too much?

Agamben correctly observes that the question of the proportionality of
the response is not a scientific one; it is moral. And the answer is not
obvious. Here, at least, Agamben arrives at a serious question. This is
exactly the kind of question we had hoped the humanist could help us
answer.

Agamben's way of addressing it is framed by a distinction between \"bare
life\" --- our biological survival --- and something he holds in higher
regard; call it social or ethical life. \"The first thing that the wave
of panic that has paralyzed the country obviously shows is that our
society no longer believes in anything but bare life,\" he observes. In
our hysterical panic, exerting herculean efforts to avoid physical harm,
we have made ourselves vulnerable to loss of a far higher order:
sacrificing our work, friendships, extended families, religious rites
(first among them, funerals), and political commitments. In this way, we
might preserve ourselves biologically, but we will have eliminated in
the process anything that gives life meaning, that makes it worth
living.

What is more, the exclusive focus on survival at any cost, on the
preservation of \"bare life,\" not only constitutes a spiritual defeat
in its own right, but turns us against one another, threatening the
possibility of meaningful human relationships and thus any semblance of
\"society\": \"Bare life --- and the danger of losing it --- is not
something that unites people, but blinds and separates them.\" Paranoia
drives us to view other human beings \"solely as possible spreaders of
the plague,\" to be avoided at all costs. Such a state, where we all
dedicate ourselves to a battle against an enemy within us, lurking in
every other person, is \"in reality, a civil war.\" The consequences,
Agamben predicts, will be grim and will outlast the epidemic. He
concludes:

> Just as wars have left as a legacy to peace a series of inauspicious
> technology, from barbed wire to nuclear power plants, so it is also
> very likely that one will seek to continue even after the health
> emergency experiments that governments did not manage to bring to
> reality before: closing universities and schools and doing lessons
> only online, putting a stop once and for all to meeting together and
> speaking for political or cultural reasons and exchanging only digital
> messages with each other, wherever possible substituting machines for
> every contact --- every contagion --- between human beings.

To be clear, [Agamben is right that the costs]{.underline} we are paying
[are]{.underline} exceedingly [high: The response to the epidemic exacts
great sacrifices]{.underline} from us as individuals and from society as
a whole. Moreover --- and putting to one side the conspiratorial
paranoia --- [there is a real risk that the virus will lower public
resistance]{.underline} to political measures that threaten democratic
self-governance: increased use of surveillance, the expansion of
executive powers, and restrictions on the freedom of movement and
association.

**[Observing]{.underline}** potential [**costs, however, is the easy
part**. What is]{.underline} much more [difficult and]{.underline} much
more [perilous is getting clear on what it is exactly that we are
sacrificing for]{.underline}. Agamben is right that a life dedicated
solely to our own biological survival is a human life in name only, and
that to voluntarily choose such a life is not merely a personal
sacrifice but a form of societywide moral self-harm. But is this really
what we are doing?

[There are]{.underline} of course [those who **refuse**]{.underline} to
bow to **[the recommendations of the authorities]{.underline}** --- the
[Florida spring breakers]{.underline}, the [St. Paddy's Day pub
crawlers. Are these the **moral heroes** Agamben is calling
for?]{.underline} In the meantime, [those of us who have, with heavy
hearts, embraced the restrictions on our freedoms, are **not merely**
aiming at our own biological survival. We have welcomed the various
institutional limitations on our lives]{.underline} (in fact sometimes
hoped our governments would introduce these sooner), and we have urged
our friends and family (especially our stubborn parents!) to do the
same, [not to ward off \"the danger of getting sick,\" **not for the
sake of our bare life**, and indeed not for the sake of the bare life of
others, but out of an **ethical imperative: to exercise the tremendous
powers of society to protect the vulnerable**, be they our loved ones or
someone else's.]{.underline}

[We are doing]{.underline} all of [this]{.underline}, in the first
place, [for our **fellow people**]{.underline} --- our
[parents]{.underline}, our [grandparents, and all those who
are]{.underline}, by dint of fate, [fragile. Nothing could be further
from our minds than]{.underline} the maintenance of their \"[bare
life]{.underline}\": [We care about these people because they are **our
kin, our friends, and the members of our community**.]{.underline}

My fiancé and I canceled our summer wedding last week. We did it so that
our guests, including my partner's high-risk father, might be able at
some later date to safely attend the social celebration of our decision
to tie our lives to one another's. We are now cooped up in our
apartment, \"isolating,\" so that we may be able to visit his father,
later, without endangering his health, if we ever make it back to
London. With any luck, we may all get to celebrate that wedding together
one day after all. With any luck, our children will one day meet their
grandfather. [Agamben laments that we are sacrificing \"social
relationships, work, even friendships, affections, and religious and
political convictions\" to \"the danger]{.underline} of getting sick.\"
But [we are not making sacrifices for the sake of]{.underline} anyone's
[**mere survival**. We sacrifice because **sharing our joys and pains,
efforts and leisure**, with our loved ones]{.underline} --- young and
old, sick and healthy --- [is the very substance of these so-called
\"normal conditions of life.\"]{.underline}

\"[What is a society]{.underline},\" Agamben asks, \"[that has no value
other than **survival**?\" Under certain circumstances, this is a good
question; under these circumstances, **it is a blind one**.]{.underline}
Is this the society Agamben believes he is living in? [When this
philosopher looks around him, does he truly see nothing but the fight
for \"bare life\"?]{.underline} If so, Agamben's \"clarification\" may
be revealing in a way he hadn't intended. We might think of it as a very
lucid example of \"bare theory\": the dressing up of outdated jargon as
a form of courageous resistance to unreflecting moral dogma. [Sometimes
it is advisable to hold off on deploying the heavy theoretical machinery
until one has looked around. If we are after wisdom about how to live
today, **we should look elsewhere**]{.underline}.

reduce the rate of its expansion are taken.

One might say that contra Agamben, [the concept of '**naked life' can
better describe the pensioner on a waiting list for a respirator or an
ICU bed**, because of a collapsed public health system, than the attempt
to adjust to the **practical exigencies** of social distancing or
quarantine measures]{.underline}. In light of the above [I
would]{.underline} like to [suggest a different return to
Foucault]{.underline}. I think that sometimes [we forget]{.underline}
that [Foucault had a highly relational conception of power
practices]{.underline}.4 In this sense, [it is legitimate to ask whether
a **democratic or even communist biopolitics is possible**]{.underline}.

To put this question in a different way: [Is it possible to have
collective practices that actually help the health of
populations]{.underline}, including large-scale behaviour modifications,
without a parallel expansion of forms of coercion and surveillance?

[Foucault himself]{.underline}, in his late work, [points towards such a
direction]{.underline}, around the notions of truth, parrhesia and care
of the self.5 In this highly original dialogue with ancient philosophy,
in particular Hellenistic and Roman, [he suggested an alternative
**politics of bios**]{.underline} that combines individual and
collective care, [based on a certain obligation and courage to tell the
truth, in non-coercive ways]{.underline}.

[In such a perspective, the decisions for the reduction of movement and
for social]{.underline} distancing in times of epidemics, [or for not
smoking]{.underline} in closed public spaces, [or for avoiding
individual and collective practices that harm the environment, would be
the result of democratically discussed collective decisions based on the
knowledge available and as part of a collective effort to care for
others and ourselves. This means that]{.underline} from simple
discipline [we move to **responsibility**]{.underline}, in regards to
others and then ourselves, [and from suspending sociality to consciously
transforming it. In such a condition, **instead of a permanent
individualized fear**]{.underline}, which can break down any sense of
social cohesion, [we move towards the idea of collective effort,
coordination and solidarity]{.underline} within a common struggle,
elements that in such health emergencies can be equally important to
medical interventions.

[This offers the possibility of a **democratic
biopolitics**]{.underline}. This can also be based on the
democratization of knowledge. [The increased access to knowledge, along
with the need for popularization campaigns makes possible collective
decision processes that are based on knowledge and
understanding]{.underline} and not just the authority of experts.

Biopolitics from below

The battle against HIV, the fight of stigma, the attempt to make people
understand that it is not the disease of 'high risk groups', the demand
for education on safe sex practices, the funding of the development of
therapeutic measures and the access to public health services, would not
have been possible without the struggle of movements such as ACT UP. One
might say that this was indeed an example of a biopolitics from below.

And in the current conjuncture, [social movements have a lot of room to
act. They can ask of immediate measures to help public health systems
withstand the extra burden]{.underline} caused by the pandemic. [They
can point to the need for solidarity and collective self-organization
during such a crisis]{.underline}, in contrast to individualized
"survivalist" panics. [They can insist on **state power (and coercion)
being used to channel resources from the private sector to socially
necessary directions**. They can organize struggles for paid sick
leave]{.underline} and for an end to measures such as eviction. [They
can put their collective ingenuity in practice to create forms of
**support for the elderly and those without any assistance**. They can
project]{.underline}, in all possible ways, [the fact that today the
struggle against the pandemic is a struggle waged by labour, not
capital, by doctors and nurses in understaffed public health systems, by
precarious workers in the vital supply chains, by those that keep basics
infrastructure running during the lock-down. And they can **demand
social change as a life-saving exigency**.]{.underline}

Kathryn **Sikkink 08**. Professor of Political Science at the University
of Minnesota. "The Role of Consequences, Comparison, and Counterfactuals
in Constructivist Ethical Thought" 2008
http://www.polisci.umn.edu/centers/theory/pdf/sikkink.pdf

Ethical arguments of these different types are ubiquitous and necessary.
But because they are also slippery and open to manipulation and misuse,
we also need to be very careful and precise about how we go about using
them. I would recommend that first we distinguish very carefully between
the comparison to ideals and historical empirical comparison. I believe
that many [critical]{.underline} constructivist [accounts rely on the
comparison to the ideal or to the conditions of possibility
counterfactual argument]{.underline}. In almost every critical
constructivist work [there is an implicit ideal ethical
argument]{.underline}. This argument is implicit because [it is rarely
clearly stated, but it is found in the nature of the]{.underline} 36
[critique.]{.underline} So, for example, in her discussion of U.S. human
rights policy, Roxanne [Doty critiques a human rights policy carried out
by actors who sometimes use it for their own self
aggrandizemen]{.underline}t and [to denigrate others]{.underline}. 42
[The implicit ideal]{.underline} this presents [is a human rights policy
that is not used for denigration or surveillance or othering those it
criticizes]{.underline} or conversely, of elevating those who advocate
it. [What would be examples of such a policy? The book does not provide
examples]{.underline}. [We do not know if examples exist in the world.
So the implicit comparison is a comparison to]{.underline} an ideal --
[a never fully stated ideal, but one present in the critique of what is
wrong with the policies discussed.]{.underline} Nicolas
[Guilhot]{.underline} makes a similar argument in his recent book. The
promotion of democracy and human rights, he argues, are increasingly
used in order to extend the power they were meant to limit. "The
promotion of democracy and human rights defines new forms of
administration on a global scale and generates a new political science."
He historically [examines how progressive movements for democracy and
human rights have become hegemonic because they "systematically managed
to integrate emancipatory and progressive forces in the construction of
imperial policies]{.underline}." [But]{.underline} once again, **[the
book offers no alternative political scenario.]{.underline}** In the
final sentence of the book, the author clarifies that "this book has no
other ambition than to contribute to the democratic critique of
democracy." 43 In the introduction, he clarifies, "This book does not
provide answers to these dilemmas. At most, its only ambition is to
highlight them, in the hope that a proper understanding constitutes a
first step toward the invention of new courses of action."44
[Ethically]{.underline}, I believe [this is a cop-out. Politically and
intellectually, I find it too comfortable and too easy.]{.underline}
This [critique has a crucial role to play in pointing to
hypocrisy]{.underline} (as Price highlights in the introduction). [It
could also serve as a catalyst for policy change in the direction of
policy that would include less surveillance or less cooptation of human
rights discourse]{.underline}. **[But it is unlikely to serve as a
catalyst for new action or policy change unless it ventures something
more than pure critique, unless it risks a political or ethical
proposal]{.underline}**. [Without that, it has the impact of
delegitimizing any human rights policy without suggesting any
alternative.]{.underline} [Any policy to promote human rights of
democracy policy is]{.underline} shown to be deeply flawed or even
pernicious. It is [portrayed as part of the problem]{.underline},
certainly not as offering any kind of solution. Human rights policy
appears to make the situation worse, not better. The critique has the
effect of telling us clearly what we do not want, what we can not
support---human rights policies by imperfect and hypocritical actors
like the U.S. In its historical comparisons, [it]{.underline} also
[lumps human rights policy together with colonialism and does not
provide any elements to distinguish between one policy of surveillance
and other.]{.underline} All are equally flawed. [The ethical effect is
to remove normative support from existing policies without producing any
alternatives]{.underline}. This is similar to what Price means when he
says that ["critical accounts which do not in fact offer constructive
normative theorizing to follow critique ironically lend themselves to
being complicit with the conservative agenda opposing erstwhile
progressive change in world politics." Neither Doty]{.underline} nor
Guilhot, for example, [contrast two human rights policies to give
examples of policies that are more of less hypocritical or where there
has been more or]{.underline} 44 Guilhot, p. 14. 38 [less
surveillance]{.underline}. **[They don't contrast human rights policies
or democracy promotion policies to previous policies that were also
hypocritical and self aggrandizing, but more pernicious]{.underline}**
-- e.g. national security ideology and support for authoritarian regimes
in the third world. By presenting no contrasts, **[the critique would
appear to say that there is no ethical or political difference between a
policy that supports coups and funds repressive military regimes and a
policy that critiques coups and cuts military aid to repressive
regimes.]{.underline}** [These policies would appear to be ethically
indistinguishable.]{.underline} Indeed, [by these standards, a realist
policy (a la Kissinger) might be preferable. Kissinger didn't denigrate
his authoritarianism allies. He took regimes as they were]{.underline}.
He treated them as valuable allies. [He didn't lecture them on how they
should change]{.underline}. [He also, in doing so, encouraged, in some
cases, coups and mass murder. **But at least he didn't
"Other".**]{.underline} [Doty]{.underline} and Guilhot
[give]{.underline} me [no ethical criteria to distinguish between the
policies of the Kissinger administration, the Carter administration, and
current Bush administration policy. Because the comparison is an
implicit ideal, never an empirical real world example, the
critique]{.underline} is very telling and [can delegitimize the
critiqued policy. But nothing is put in its place.]{.underline} So,
[**it demobilizes any support we might have for any human rights
policy**.]{.underline} **[It puts the analyst in an ethically
comfortable position, but by not proposing any explicit comparison, it
demobilizes the reader]{.underline}**. [We learn what to oppose, to
critique, but we don't learn explicitly what to support in its stead.
**The result can be political paralysis.**]{.underline} One finds it
difficult to act.

### AT: Antiwar Movement Alt\-\--2AC

#### Antiwar movements fail. 

James Jay **Carafano 08**. Senior research fellow for national security
at The Heritage Foundation. \"The Wilting Anti-War Movement\". Heritage
Foundation. 7-22-2008.
https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/the-wilting-anti-war-movement

One thing\'s certain: **[[The anti-war movement in the United States
won\'t drive foreign policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, [such
factions never do]{.underline}.

[Anti-war movements are a fixture]{.underline} of American culture
dating back to the Revolution. Americans argue about their wars before,
during and after. That\'s an inherent feature of how democracies go to
war. [Nevertheless, [the role]{.mark} of dissenters [in shaping]{.mark}
American [attitudes is]{.mark} particularly **[overblown]{.mark}**.
Americans like to make up their own minds.]{.underline}

[**[Anti-war movements don\'t drive public will]{.mark}**. They ride the
crest of the public opinion wave]{.underline}. For example, there was a
vocal and well-organized movement to keep America out of World War II.
It was led by aviator Charles Lindberg, an all-American hero, and Gerald
Nye, the irrepressible populist senator from North Dakota. Their
following collapsed after Pearl Harbor.

Today\'s [[anti-war movement didn\'t]{.underline}]{.mark} so much
[[shape]{.underline}]{.mark} public [[opinion as **feed off
it**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Americans had been
frustrated]{.underline}]{.mark} by the lack of progress in stabilizing
Iraq after the conflict and the death spiral of violence dragging the
country into civil war. But [[contrary to]{.mark} what [anti-war
activists]{.mark} fervently claimed, that [angst wasn\'t the result of
Americans\' feeling repelled by]{.mark} a long [war]{.mark} or by
causalities]{.underline}.

[Americans are averse to failure]{.underline}, sending their sons and
daughters and national treasure into harm\'s way when there seems no
purpose. Americans can accept sacrifice as long as they believe that the
cause serves their national interest and that the goal is attainable.

A new U.S. strategy in Iraq has stemmed violence, put Al Qaeda on its
heels, frustrated Iran\'s hope to dominate the country and renewed hopes
for establishing a stable state. Indeed, for many Americans, the
ferocity with which Al Qaeda and Iran have tried to exploit conditions
in Iraq is a grim reminder of how dangerous America\'s enemies really
are.

In turn, Americans have become more sanguine about meeting our
responsibilities in Iraq, even though it appears the effort will take
years and all the troops won\'t be coming home soon. The anti-war
movement is continuing the charge, but most Americans aren\'t following.

[Nor do the anti-war movements share any political
coherence]{.underline}. All they have in common is opposition to the
war. **[When that cause goes away, the movement will fall
apart]{.underline}**. This is already happening with the anti-Iraq war
movement.

It\'s ironic to watch the veterans against the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan trying to mimic the Vietnam era \"Winter Soldier\" project
by allegedly documenting widespread atrocities by U.S. military forces.

The Vietnam project produced sensational, but highly dubious, results.
America\'s Army was never the \"barbarian horde\" that young John Kerry
famously claimed it was. Likewise, virtually every one of today\'s men
and women in uniform serve honorably, as well. Most Americans believe in
their soldiers, so a new \"Winter Soldier\" project will only further
distance the movement from mainstream politics.

The Constitution designed a government that insulates the president from
such political factions. A newly elected president has a mandate from
the American people and usually is able to rise above the demands of
divisive groups.

Only one American president, Gerald Ford, was ever forced to quit a war.
He is the exception that proves the rule. Congress voted to cut funds
supporting South Vietnam even though by 1975 our country had largely put
the war behind it. The problem was Ford was an unelected president with
no support from either the left or the right.

In contrast, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} next [[president will have
**more than enough political will to push back against a**]{.mark} now
wilting [anti-war movement]{.mark}]{.underline}. The winner will,
however, have to put America\'s interests first and have the courage to
deal with the realities of international affairs rather than the whims
of political factions here at home - no matter what he has promised.

[While]{.underline} politicians and [commentators in the West continue
to promote the comforting notion that Russians are themselves victims of
Putin's regime]{.underline}, virtually **[all]{.underline}** the
**[available evidence points to strong Russian public support for the
war in Ukraine]{.underline}**. [A recent survey conducted by Russia's
only internationally respected independent pollster]{.underline}, the
Levada Center, [found that **81% of Russians back the invasion of
Ukraine** with just 14% opposed]{.underline}. Another recent
[Levada]{.underline} Center poll [identified a **12% surge in Vladimir
Putin's approval rating** since the beginning of the war]{.underline}.
[These results have been **mirrored in numerous other
polls**]{.underline} and surveys.

Meanwhile, **[the anti-war movement inside Russia remains
underwhelming]{.underline}**. There have been some public protests in
major Russian cities, but these [rallies have **failed to attract
significant numbers** and been **easily contained by the
authorities**]{.underline}. [Rather than engaging in anti-war activism,
most of the Russians who claim to oppose the regime have **stayed
silent**]{.underline} or chosen exile and voluntarily left the country.

Positive Russian attitudes toward the war are rooted in longstanding
perceptions of Ukraine as part of Russia's imperial heartlands. Despite
the passage of three decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
many Russians have never fully come to terms with the idea of an
independent Ukraine and continue to regard the country as an indivisible
element of historic Russia that has been artificially separated from the
motherland.

Putin did not invent such sentiments but he has proven highly skilled at
exploiting them. In his many speeches and essays on the Ukraine issue,
he has consistently appealed to Russia's imperial aspirations while
playing on widespread resentment at the country's post-Soviet
humiliations and loss of superpower status. When Putin laments the fall
of the USSR as the "demise of historical Russia," ordinary Russians
understand that it is primarily Ukraine he has in mind.

The Russian leader's refusal to recognize Ukrainian statehood is not
only a rejection of the post-1991 settlement. It is entirely in line
with traditional Russian thinking and echoes key tenets of Czarist
imperial doctrine dating back centuries. Putin routinely denies
Ukraine's right to exist and has frequently accused modern Ukraine of
occupying historically Russian lands while dismissing Ukraine's entire
centuries-long statehood struggle as a Western ploy to destabilize
Russia. On the eve of the invasion, he called Ukraine "an inalienable
part of our own history, culture and spiritual space."

Putin is particularly fond of declaring that Russians and Ukrainians are
"one people." This insistence that Ukrainians and Russians are part of
the same whole has long been a central theme of Russian imperial
propaganda toward Ukraine and provides the ideological basis for the
current war. By positioning Ukraine as rightfully Russian, it reframes
the unprovoked invasion of a peaceful neighbor as a justified response
to a grave historical injustice.

In recent months, the Russian ruler has gone even further. He has
branded modern Ukraine an "anti-Russia" that can no longer be tolerated
while claiming the country has been taken over by the West. This
resonates deeply with the Russian public, which has traditionally
associated any manifestations of Ukrainian statehood with treachery and
extremism.

We are currently witnessing the criminal consequences of these imperial
delusions. Russian soldiers who have been encouraged to dismiss
Ukrainians as traitors and view Ukraine itself as an anti-Russian
invention are now engaging in war crimes that are entirely in keeping
with the genocidal tone adopted by Putin and other Kremlin officials. As
Voltaire once warned, "Those who can make you believe absurdities can
make you commit atrocities."

On the domestic front, the Kremlin-controlled mainstream media openly
discusses the need to destroy Ukraine. For example, an article published
by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on April 3 made clear that
Putin's talk of "de-nazification" is actually code for the
"de-Ukrainianization" of Ukraine. This chilling text laid out a detailed
plan for the elimination of the Ukrainian nation and was branded a
"genocide handbook" by Yale historian Timothy Snyder.

[If Russian imperialism is not confronted and defeated]{.underline} in
Ukraine, **[other countries will soon face similar
threats]{.underline}**. While Ukraine appears to be a particular
obsession for both Putin and the wider Russian public, [the list of
other potential victims is long. The Baltic states and Moldova are among
the most likely]{.underline} to become targets of Russian imperial
aggression, [while the nations of Central Asia are clearly
at]{.underline} risk. It is also worth noting that Poland and Finland
were once part of the Russian Empire that Putin longs to resurrect.

For almost three decades, Western leaders have approached successive
acts of Russian imperial aggression as isolated incidents and have
sought to downplay their significance while focusing on the economic
advantages of continuing to do business with Moscow. This has only
served to encourage the Kremlin. The Chechen wars of the early
post-Soviet years were followed by the 2008 invasion of Georgia and the
2014 seizure of Crimea. The current war is the latest milestone in this
grim sequence but it will not be the last. [Resurgent Russian
imperialism now clearly poses the **biggest single challenge to global
security**. Countering this threat must be the international community's
top priority]{.underline}.

**[Don't blame NATO]{.underline}** expansion **[for]{.underline}** this
pointless and terrifying **[crisis]{.underline}**. [Don't blame the
post-Cold War hubris of the West]{.underline}. **[Blame Russian
imperialism]{.underline}** and the monumental sense of historical
grievance that animates every decision the Kremlin makes.

[Many]{.underline} American academics, [pundits]{.underline}, and
politicians [vehemently disagree with this assessment]{.underline}.
Harvard professor Stephen Walt argues that the \"great tragedy is this
entire affair was avoidable.\" Avoidable because Putin manufactured a
military threat from Ukraine to justify his imperial ambitions? Of
course not.

Like so many realist scholars, Walt blames the West: \"Had the United
States and its European allies not succumbed to hubris, wishful
thinking, and liberal idealism and relied instead on realism's core
insights, the present crisis would not have occurred.\" This has been
Walt's position for years -- whether it's the Russian invasion of
Georgia or Crimea or Ukraine itself, the expansion of NATO is always the
trigger for Moscow's aggression. Walt's fellow realist John Mearsheimer
makes the same argument.

But for all its pretensions of hardheadedness, realism fails to account
for [the most significant determinant of Russia's behavior]{.underline}
over the past two decades: **[Putin's imperialism]{.underline}**.
[After]{.underline} the invasion and annexation of [Crimea, Putin
delivered a speech about the grievous historic injustice of Ukrainian
independence.]{.underline}

At the end of the Cold War, he said, \"Russia realized that it was not
simply robbed, it was plundered.\" He celebrated the "culture,
civilization and human values that unite the peoples of Russia, Ukraine
and Belarus.\" He argued that \"Crimea has always been an inseparable
part of Russia.\" He observed that Crimea was originally \"transferred
within the boundaries of a single state. Back then, it was impossible to
imagine that Ukraine and Russia may split up and become two separate
states. However, this has happened.\"

[Putin still finds it impossible to imagine that Ukraine is an
autonomous state]{.underline} -- a democracy, no less, which poses a
direct ideological challenge to his own sputtering oligarchy. As he
explained to President George W. Bush during a NATO summit in April
2008: \"George, you have to understand that Ukraine is not even a
country. Part of its territory is in Eastern Europe and the greater part
was given to us.\"

A brief glimpse at the historical record gives the lie to this empty
revanchist claim -- the Ukrainian parliament supported independence by a
vast margin in 1991. In fact, Russia was one of the first states to
recognize Ukrainian sovereignty -- as the Economist essay notes,
Ukrainian independence and cohesion \"set a precedent for Russia to
define itself the same way, and refuse independence to restive
territories such as Chechnya.\" Granted, Moscow still expected to have
strong ties with Ukraine, but Putin's insistence that it's \"not even a
country\" is as absurd and ahistorical as it is nakedly self-serving.

[It's possible to read a whole lot of commentary about Russia and
Ukraine today without]{.underline} confronting any of this history -- or
[considering]{.underline} the lens through which [Putin]{.underline}
views that history. [The view that **NATO**]{.underline} expansion
**[was a catastrophic mistake assumes that Russian aggression is a
'natural' reaction to the perceived threat of Western
encroachment]{.underline}**. In other words, massing 100,000 troops on
Ukraine's border is what any great power would do in similar
circumstances.

[Those]{.underline} who make this argument present NATO expansion as the
primary culprit because they evidently [haven't considered the
possibility that **Putin would have found some other pretext for the
expansion** of Russia's sphere of influence at gunpoint]{.underline}.
Nor do they seem interested in discussing the likelihood that **[Putin
would have taken advantage of NATO's absence]{.underline}** in Eastern
Europe. Nor do they seem to care about the democratic aspirations or
self-determination of the countries in the region.

Although the majority of the left has condemned the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, the left camp's unity is still lacking. [We would like to
address those on the left who still stick to "a plague on both houses"
position]{.underline} that views the war as an inter-imperialist war.

[It is high time the left woke up and carried out a "concrete analysis
of the concrete situation" instead of reproducing worn-out frameworks
from the Cold War]{.underline}. **[Overlooking Russian imperialism is a
terrible mistake]{.underline}** for the left**[. It is Putin, not NATO,
who is waging war on Ukraine]{.underline}**. That is why [it is
essential to **shift our focus from Western imperialism to Putin's
aggressive imperialism**, which has an ideological and political basis
in addition to an economic one.]{.underline}

[Russian imperialism]{.underline} consists of two elements. Firstly, it
[involves **revisionist Russian nationalism**]{.underline}. After 2012,
[Putin]{.underline} and his establishment [moved]{.underline} from a
civic concept of the nation (as rossiysky, "related to Russia") [to an
**exclusive, ethnically based** concept of Russianness]{.underline} (as
russkiy, "ethnically/culturally Russian"). [His aggression in 2014 and
in 2022 was legitimized by the return of **"originally" Russian
lands**]{.underline}. Moreover, this concept of (ethnic)
"[Russianness]{.underline}" revives the nineteenth-century imperial
concept of the Russian nation, which [reduces Ukrainian and Belarusian
identity to regional identities]{.underline}. According to this view,
Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians are a single people. Employing
this concept in official rhetoric implies the negation of independent
Ukrainian statehood. [That is why we cannot say with any degree of
certainty that Putin only wants the recognition of Russian sovereignty
over Crimea and the Donbas]{.underline}. Putin may desire to either
annex or subdue the whole of Ukraine, threats which appear in his
article "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians" and in his
speech on February 21, 2022. Finally, the perspective of Ukraine-Russia
peace talks look rather bleak, as Russia's negotiation team is headed by
former Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky, one of the most dedicated
believers in the ideology of russkiy mir (the ethnic Russian world) -- a
world where, believe us, no one will be happy.

Secondly, even though Putin's aggression is hard to explain rationally,
[current events have demonstrated that it may be reasonable
enough]{.underline}, nevertheless, [to take **Russian imperialist
rhetoric at face value. Russian imperialism is fueled by the desire to
change the**]{.underline} so-called "**[world order]{.underline}**."
Thus, [Putin's demand for NATO's withdrawal from Eastern Europe may
signal that **Russia may not stop with Ukraine, and Poland, Latvia,
Lithuania, or Estonia may be the next targets** of Putin's aggression.
It is very naïve to demand to demilitarize Eastern Europe]{.underline},
because in the light of current circumstances, [that will only be
**appeasing Putin** and will make Eastern European countries
**vulnerable to Putin's aggression**]{.underline}. **[Discourse about
NATO]{.underline}** expansion **[obscures Putin's desire to divide the
spheres of influence in Europe]{.underline}** between the US and Russia.
Being in the Russian sphere of influence means a country's political
subordination to Russia and subjection to the expansion of Russian
capital. [The cases of Georgia and Ukraine demonstrate that **Putin is
ready to use force**]{.underline} to influence the political affairs of
countries which he believes wish to leave the Russian sphere of
influence. It is important to understand that Putin's understanding of
key agents in the world order is basically limited to the US and China.
He does not recognize other countries' sovereignty, regarding them as
satellites of one of these agents of the international order.

[Putin and his establishment are very cynical]{.underline}. They use the
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, American intervention in Afghanistan, and
the invasion of Iraq as a shield for the bombing of Ukraine. In this
context, the left must show consistency and say no to all imperialist
aggression in the world. [Today **the imperialist aggressor is Russia,
not NATO**, and if Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, it will definitely
**continue its aggression**.]{.underline}

Furthermore, **[we must have no illusions about Putin's regime. It
offers no alternative to Western capitalism]{.underline}**. [It is an
authoritarian, oligarchic capitalism. The level of **inequality** in
Russia has **risen significantly** during the 20 years of his
leadership. Putin is not only an enemy of the working class, but also an
enemy to all forms of **democracy**]{.underline}. Popular participation
in politics and voluntary associations is treated with suspicion in
Russia. **[Putin is essentially an anti-Communist]{.underline}** and an
enemy to everything the left fought for in the twentieth century and is
fighting for in the twenty-first. **[In his worldview, the strong have a
right to beat the weak, the rich have the right to exploit the poor, and
strongmen in power have the right to make decisions on behalf of their
disempowered population]{.underline}**. This worldview must be dealt a
severe blow in Ukraine. In order for political change to come about
inside of Russia, the Russian army must be defeated in Ukraine.

[We]{.underline} have [presented the argument that a shift needs to
occur in cybersecurity theory and policy]{.underline}. [One way of
achieving this is through]{.underline} the application of the [societal
security]{.underline} approach [and its adaption and application to
cyberthreats]{.underline}. The approach has been applied to other policy
areas with considerable benefit to our understanding of contemporary
security issues and in finding ways to actively address them. To shift
responsibility to the societal sector, **[a process of de-securitisation
is necessary]{.underline}**. This involves framing cyberthreats
differently, both through general discourse, but also consciously,
through policy formulation and in the media. We recognise that this
process will be confronted by powerful political, bureaucratic and
commercial interests.

[In making this argument, **we do not propose that military cyberthreats
should not be taken seriously**, or that the **military**]{.underline}
and intelligence **[agencies should not have a role in
cybersecurity]{.underline}**. [Buzan's conceptualisation of security
recognised that **the military had an ongoing role**]{.underline}. The
arguments that cyberattacks can be used for force protection and/or in
place of the use of military force have merit. [What we are arguing for
is that the military and intelligence community 'stay in
lane']{.underline}, recognise the spillover effects of strategic
cyberconflict, [and]{.underline} are not the lead players in societal
security efforts, but **[play a coordinating role]{.underline}**. [There
are]{.underline} two other **[potential perils]{.underline}** in this
approach -- the first is [that society itself is **not coordinated
enough to address societal threats effectively**]{.underline}. This is
rooted in one of the core critiques of societal security as a theory,
which is that there has been a tendency to reify societies as
independent social agents (Theiler 2003). As others have argued, [there
has been a reluctance]{.underline} in the private (and indeed societal)
sector [to take on responsibility or liability for
**cybersecurity**]{.underline} (Carr 2016), especially where it would
entail considerable costs and a reluctance by governments to pass on
responsibility for security to the private sector (Dunn Cavelty and
Brunner 2007). There are very strong headwinds here, including a
continued predisposition to use securitising discourse, the ongoing
power of the national security state, a deteriorating global
geopolitical environment, and the continued dominance of big tech.
Nevertheless, [it is a **fundamental requirement** for a more effective,
less conflictual cybersecurity environment to emerge]{.underline}.
Second, the role that society takes in cybersecurity should not lead to
the same practices that intelligence agencies and military institutions
have been engaged in, including surveillance, intrusions into privacy
and the creation of fear and mistrust within and between communities. In
other words, moving towards a societal cybersecurity approach should not
entail securitising society itself. This concern has been addressed in
some detail through the Foucauldian school of securitisation theory (see
Schuilenburg 2012) and highlights that avoiding negative consequences
will involve effective multi-stakeholder management of cyber issues at
the local level.

### AT: Democracy/Law K\-\--2AC/1AR 

#### No link\-\--Coercive democratization is categorically distant from the aff\-\--nuance is key. 

Laurence **Whitehead 09**. Politics Fellow @ Nuffield College. "Losing
'the Force'? The 'Dark Side' of democratization after Iraq"
Democratization 16 (2) p. 237-238

In this exploratory article, I have highlighted several main areas for
reconsideration. They are illustrative rather than exhaustive, and the
points raised are preliminary rather than final. [The teleology of
liberal universalism is an easy target for criticism. But Iraq should
not trigger a wholesale abandonment of that type of
analysis]{.underline}. Instead, [we need a more complex and **nuanced
assessment** of the interactions between geo-strategic needs and
calculations]{.underline}, and the partially autonomous influence of
democratic norms and values. [Dis-aggregation between sets of cases can
help]{.underline} here. Different historical periods, different degrees
of exposure to external pressure, and different 'large region' settings
can all affect both the content and the quality of democratization
processes in individual cases. [But in the cases of Afghanistan, Iraq,
and]{.underline} a few [more, we are **not just dealing
with**]{.underline} severe external **[pressures]{.underline}**. Regime
change in these cases has been imposed wholesale and coercively in the
name of international doctrines of humanitarian intervention and the
right to democracy[. This category of coercive democratizations may need
to be separated out from all the rest.]{.underline} Arguably **[they are
not democratizations at all.]{.underline}** At any rate, the declared
motives, revealed intentions, and measurable outcomes of such forced
regime changes require detached comparative analysis and critical
scrutiny. It may be that in the light of the accumulating evidence on
these cases, the theoretical arguments for this type of operation will
need to be reassessed. I have also touched on the possibility that the
'quality' of democracy in the most long-established Western polyarchies
could decline as a side effect of their resorting to coercive
democratization overseas. This is a very underdeveloped topic, in part
because [the Iraq experience is]{.underline} so recent and perhaps so
[atypical]{.underline}. Nevertheless, it merits careful monitoring in
the years to come.

[There is a long tradition on the Left of ambivalence towards
democracy]{.underline}, and scepticism regarding the idea of democracy
[promotion]{.underline}. There are various underlying reasons which are
often present in an undifferentiated amalgam. From Marxism there is
doubt about 'bourgeois democracy', related to the view that the state is
the 'armed wing of the bourgeoisie'. In other words, the state is not a
neutral arbiter between different interests but systematically acts to
repress the common interest in favour of the ruling class. Marx was
ambivalent about the potential of democracy and although his schema of
socioeconomic progress involved the overthrow of bourgeois rule and the
installation of a dictatorship of the proletariat, he also indicated
that in established democracies such as Britain, transformatory change
might be possible through democratic elections. This ambivalence
solidified into a full‐blown split in the socialist movement in the
first years of the twentieth century with the communist wing arguing
that only revolution could bring about real change, while social
democrats proposed change through constitutional means, rejecting the
concept of revolutionary transformation in favour of democratic
gradualism; evolutionary socialism (Bernstein, \[1911\] 1961). It is
important to historically contextualize the debate within the socialist
movement about democracy. Universal suffrage was not instituted in any
country prior to the beginning of the 20th century, and thus the battle
for social justice was waged against largely authoritarian regimes. Once
democratic systems were established in the most developed countries, it
became crucial to understand why socialists did not automatically win
elections. Much of early twentieth Western Marxism was devoted to
understanding the phenomenon of workers apparently acting against their
self‐interest by voting for -- and supporting -- anti‐socialist
political parties. In this context, the work of Lukacs (\[1920\] 1967)
and Gramsci (1989) on class consciousness, reification, and hegemony is
particularly significant. Despite the continued application by Leftist
movements and leaders of the Bonapartist model for several decades,
particularly in the developing world, there was a gradual
acknowledgement within the Left that hegemonic orders in complex
contemporary societies depend on multi‐faceted consent. The democratic
institutions in contemporary society are only one of the markers of
consent, but political movements need to dominate those institutions in
order to secure the formal and symbolic legitimacy required to implement
a political programme. Therefore, [notwithstanding an acknowledgement of
the structured disadvantage faced by progressive social movements in the
democratic system, engagement with the democratic system is a
**necessary component of leftist strategy**, and rejectionism is likely
to **disengagement and apathy**]{.underline} (Laclau, 2000: 290). Moving
beyond instrumental reasons for democratic engagement I would like to
present two normative arguments in favour of democracy as an important
aspect of the critical governance agenda. First, [democracy provides an
**opportunity for engagement in debate** about the nature of
society.]{.underline} It is not necessary to accept the arguably naïve
precepts of Habermas's deliberative democracy to comprehend that [a
social order based on non‐violent resolution of conflict is more likely
to present opportunities for **egalitarian social change** than one
enforced by violence that is more likely to be held by
elites,]{.underline} or more definitively, violence defines elitism.
Mouffe (2000) describes the objective of democratic engagement as
agonism. Agonism essentially entails acknowledgement of irreconcilable
difference between political programmes, but common acceptance that
debate should remain within the institutional framework of democracy.
More fundamentally, one of the experiences of actually existing
socialism has been that the practice of power is problematic
notwithstanding the overt objective with which power is sought and held.
Blaug (2000, 2010) argues that the exercise of power leads inevitably to
a form of anti‐social madness. Power has a metamorphic effect on
personality; "emergence of an overestimated self", in which its holders
tend to lose touch with others' interests, and tend to disparage and
oppress subordinates. Power corrupts both leaders and subordinates,
corrupting elites and creating collusion in subordinates through a
practice of learned helplessness. Power is internalized and tends to be
unseen and internalized. Power holders are generally unaware of the
changes in their perspectives and subalterns unaware of their
subordination. Hierarchies do have efficiency benefits in certain
circumstances, but they have costs in terms of the corruption of power.
Complete elimination of hierarchy is impossible, but Blaug believes we
can have less hierarchy and more democracy and still achieve
organisational effectiveness. Transposing this general argument on the
nature and abuse of power to the political arena, it is clear that
[democracy is necessary to have any possibility for achieving
egalitarianism,]{.underline} and further, that the [**progressive
struggle** is for the extension of democracy to ever wider
domains.]{.underline} Within the development community there is a common
tendency to present democracy in terms of its instrumental value in
facilitating economic development. There is significant evidence --
albeit contested -- that democracy facilitates economic growth (Olson,
1993; Siegle et al., 2004; UNDP, 2002). Those who dispute this
relationship normally argue not that democracy reduces economic growth
but that there is no clear relationship between the two, or that
democracy only benefits certain parts of the population such as the
middle class (Ross, 2006). Further, there is significant evidence that
democracy improves outcomes for measures of human development when
controlled for factors such as per capita income, in a wide range of
domains including overall population longevity, reduced child mortality,
improved nutrition, better child welfare, and improved educational
attainment (Harding and Wantchekon, 2010). The logic of the mutually
supportive relationship between democracy and development is presented
below: However, a stronger argument in favour of democracy is that it is
an indissoluble part of development, a perspective made famous by
Amartya Sen (1999). Indeed, [Sen turns the democracy development debate
inside out in arguing that without political rights we cannot define
what development means for us and therefore determine our own economic
needs:]{.underline} \"Political rights, including freedom of expression
and discussion, are not only pivotal in inducing social responses to
economic needs, they are also central to the conceptualization of
economic needs themselves.\" (Sen, 1999: 154) An important consideration
in justifying support to democracy promotion is the perspective of
citizens. [Numerous surveys have been carried out on public attitudes to
democracy, with results that are surprisingly consistent across regions.
**A great majority** of the population, whether living in democracies or
under dictatorship, **support democratic governance**, notwithstanding
frequently expressed disappointment in the actual performance of
democracies]{.underline} (Shin and Tusalem, 2007). In this section we
have considered the merits of democracy from a critical or Leftist
perspective. The preference of democratic transformation over
revolutionary change is argued on the grounds of the necessity of
securing consent through broad legitimacy in complex contemporary
societies. From an instrumental point of view, [violent overthrow is an
unlikely vehicle for improving social equity because by definition **the
tools of violence are primarily controlled by elites**]{.underline}. It
is preferable to promote and insist upon non‐violent debate, which does
not require a naïve presumption that consensus can be achieved. The work
of Ricardo Blaug is helpful in explaining why **[authoritarian orders of
either the Right or Left are unlikely ultimately to benefit the majority
of the population]{.underline}**. [Hierarchical power leads to a type of
madness in which leaders lose touch with the needs of **the
subaltern**]{.underline}, [and the subaltern in turn tends to become
dependent on the Leader. The result will be political decisions
consistently benefiting the elite over the masses, with a diminished
capacity of subalterns to understand and combat their own
repression]{.underline}. [This psychological explanation is buttressed
with empirical evidence showing improved human development outcomes for
democracy]{.underline}, explained by Sen as others as deriving from the
necessity of freedom to identify and strive for the realisation of
economic needs. Finally, and importantly, a considerable majority of the
population, whether living in democracies or dictatorships, consistently
supports democracy over authoritarianism.

The problem is that [the case for Russian decline is
**overstated**]{.underline}. Much of the [evidence for]{.underline} it,
such as [Russia's shrinking population and its resource-dependent
economy, is **not as consequential**]{.underline} for the Kremlin [as
many]{.underline} in Washington [assume]{.underline}. [Nor should the
United States expect that Russia will automatically abandon
its]{.underline} course of [confrontation once]{.underline} President
Vladimir [Putin leaves]{.underline} office. [[**Putin's foreign policy**
enjoys **widespread support**]{.underline}]{.mark} among the country's
ruling elite, [[and]{.mark} his legacy [will include a **thicket of
unresolved disputes**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [chief among
them]{.underline} that over the annexation of [Crimea]{.underline}. Any
**[[disagreements]{.mark} with the United States [are]{.mark} here [to
stay]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Put simply, [Washington cannot]{.underline} afford to fixate on China
while [hop]{.underline}ing [to]{.underline} simply [wait Russia out.
Rather than viewing Russia as a declining power, U.S. leaders should see
it as a **persistent one**]{.underline}---and have a frank conversation
about the country's true capabilities and vulnerabilities.
[Rethinking]{.underline} American [[assumptions about Russian
power]{.mark} would [allow policymakers]{.mark} to [address]{.mark} what
will be a period of **prolonged [confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[with a **capable adversary**]{.underline}.

FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS

Expectations of Russian decline contain important truths. The country's
economy is stagnant, with few sources of value other than the extraction
and export of natural resources. The entire system is rife with
corruption and dominated by inefficient state-owned or state-controlled
enterprises, and international sanctions limit access to capital and
technology. Russia struggles to develop, retain, and attract talent; the
state chronically underfunds scientific research; and bureaucratic
mismanagement hinders technological innovation. As a result, Russia lags
considerably behind the United States and China in most metrics of
scientific and technological development. Military spending has largely
plateaued in the last four years, and the population is forecast to
decline by ten million people by 2050.

With such a dismal outlook, [it is natural [to assume]{.mark} that
[Russia's]{.mark} capacity for disruption and
[hostility]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}on the international stage
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} soon [[diminish]{.underline}]{.mark},
too---that the Kremlin will simply run out of resources for its
aggressive foreign policy. But **[those data points [miss the broader
picture]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [They highlight Russia's weaknesses and
**downplay its strengths**]{.underline}. Russia may be "a downshifter
country," as Herman Gref, the head of Russia's largest bank, complained
in 2016. But [[its **economic, demographic, and military** potential
will remain **substantial**]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather than entering a
precipitous decline.

Consider [the country's economy]{.underline}, which, stagnant as it may
be, [is]{.underline} still [larger and more resilient than many
believe]{.underline}. Analysts like to point out that Russia's GDP of
\$1.5 trillion is comparable to that of Italy or Texas. But that \$1.5
trillion is calculated using market exchange rates. [Factor in
purchasing power parity, and it balloons to \$4.1 trillion, which would
make Russia the second-largest economy in Europe and the sixth-largest
in the world]{.underline}. Neither measure is wholly accurate---one is
likely an underestimate, the other an overestimate---but the comparison
shows that **[Russia's economy is nowhere near as small as the
conventional wisdom holds]{.underline}**. At any rate, raw GDP is often
a poor measure of geopolitical power: it no longer translates easily
into military potential or international influence.

To be sure, Russia's economy has not been kind to its citizens. Real
disposable incomes are ten percent lower today than they were in 2013,
wiping out nearly a decade of growth. But [macroeconomic
indicators]{.underline} are stable enough to [allow Moscow to project
power well into the future]{.underline}. After Russia's annexation of
Crimea and occupation of eastern Ukraine in 2014, international
sanctions and falling oil prices caused its economy to tumble. In the
years since, however, [[the government has]{.mark} reined in its
spending and adapted to lower oil prices, creating budget surpluses and
[a **growing war chest**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The latest estimates, as
of August 2021, put the value of Russia's National Wealth Fund at about
\$185 billion and its foreign currency reserves at \$615
billion---hardly a picture of destitution. A new policy of import
substitution, devised in response to international sanctions, has
breathed new life into the agricultural sector, whose exports now rake
in more than \$30 billion annually. The Kremlin has also reoriented
trade away from the West and toward China, currently its number one
trading partner. Trade with China is expected to exceed \$200 billion by
2024, twice what it was in 2013.

What of Russia's dependence on extractive industries? Oil and gas sales
continue to account for about 30--40 percent of the government's budget,
meaning that a future shift away from fossil fuels will sting. But it is
unclear how near that future really is. And Russia produces energy at
such a low price that other exporting countries are likely to get
squeezed well before it sees its budget crimped. In addition, Russia is
the main energy supplier to the European Union, whose dependency has
only grown over the past decade: the EU gets 41 percent of its natural
gas, 27 percent of its oil, and 47 percent of its solid fossil fuels
from Russia. The problem Moscow faces is that its resources are not
infinite. Russia's oil production will peak in the coming decade---some
think it may have done so already---meaning that the country's capacity
to export easily extractable (and thus cheap) oil will hit a ceiling.

Meanwhile, [although Russia lags behind the United States in
technological innovation, it still ranks among the **top ten worldwide
in research-and-development spending**]{.underline}. In the case of
artificial intelligence, it may not even matter whether the country is a
leader or a follower: given the many applications and the commercial
utility of this technology, [Moscow will likely realize some
**second-mover advantages**]{.underline} while letting the United States
and China take on the costs and risks of pioneering its development.
Moreover, Russia has a struggling but viable technology sector and has
developed its own analogs to Facebook, Google, and other popular online
platforms, all of which are fairly successful within Russia.

OF MILITARY AND MEN

Among the most common misconceptions about Russia is that the country's
demographic outlook will dramatically constrain its future capabilities.
Such demographic determinism has historically failed to predict Russia's
fortunes. According to UN forecasts, Russia's population will shrink by
about seven percent by 2050; more pessimistic projections see a decline
of up to 11 percent. Even in the latter case, [Russia would remain the
most populous country in Europe and Eurasia by a wide
margin]{.underline}. It may lag behind highly developed Western
countries in life expectancy and mortality rates, but it has
substantially narrowed those gaps since the 1990s. [The country is
certainly **not on the brink of demographic collapse**.]{.underline}

More important, [the relevance of demographics to state power needs
rethinking. Modern great powers are defined not by the size of their
populations but by their populations' quality]{.underline}: people's
health, educational levels, and labor productivity, among other
indicators. Were it otherwise, countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia,
and Nigeria would be among the world's most powerful states. As the
American scholar Hal Brands has written, "All things equal, countries
with healthy demographic profiles can create wealth more easily than
their competitors." On this front, [Russia has shown considerable
improvement since the **1990s**]{.underline}, [with reduced mortality,
increased lifespans, and an improved fertility rate]{.underline}. Until
2015, it steadily rose on indexes such as the UN's Human Development
Index and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's
labor productivity measures. An economic recession has since slowed down
this trend, and undone some of the progress, but Russia's overall
situation has considerably improved from a demographic crisis in the
1990s and predictions of demographic doom in the early years of this
century.

Brain drain remains a major problem, with many of Russia's brightest
leaving the country. Its economic impact, however, has been difficult to
measure. And even as many middle-class Russians who are essential to the
knowledge economy leave, Russia benefits from substantial immigration by
job seekers from the former Soviet republics. Russia's demographic
profile is composed of mixed indicators that show qualitative
improvements alongside quantitative decline. Meanwhile, the demographic
outlooks for many of the United States' allies and partners are equally
problematic, if not more so.

MILITARY MIGHT

Above all, **[[Russia will remain a military force to be reckoned
with]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Military power has historically been a
Russian **strength**]{.underline}, compensating for the country's
relatively undiversified economy, technological backwardness, and lack
of political dynamism. It is in part why Russia managed to sustain
prolonged competitions with economically much stronger states in the
past, whether it was the United States or the British Empire. After its
nadir in the early post-Soviet era, Russian military power has been
revived---and will only improve in the coming decade, even as American
policymakers turn their attention to China.

[[Russia remains the]{.mark} United States' [primary peer in
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark} technology**]{.underline}. Aside
from NATO, it also fields the strongest conventional military in Europe,
reforged following a period of military reforms and investments since
2008. That transformation was largely overlooked prior to 2014, which
explains why [Russia's military [moves in Ukraine and]{.mark}, later, in
[Syria took many]{.mark} analysts [by surprise]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Today, [[the Russian military is at its **highest level** of
readiness]{.mark}, mobility, and technical capability in
decades]{.underline}. NATO remains superior on paper, but much is
contingent in war, and [NATO's]{.underline} apparent [superiority does
not guarantee victory or the ability to deter Russia]{.underline} across
the range of possible conflicts. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[fields a **flexible** ]{.mark}**array of special forces, mercenaries,
and [military]{.mark} intelligence operatives**]{.underline}. [This is
before considering]{.underline} the country's status as a leading power
in **[space or]{.underline}** its extensive **[[cyberwarfare
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which [were]{.mark} recently
[demonstrated by]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the so-called
[[SolarWinds]{.underline}]{.mark} breach, in which Russian hackers
penetrated and spied on several U.S. government agencies.

Adjusting for purchasing power parity and for the peculiarities of
autarkic defense sectors such as Russia's, analysts have estimated that
[[Russia spends]{.mark} somewhere between \$[150 billion]{.mark} and
\$180 billion [per year on defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, considerably
more than the market exchange rate figure of \$58 billion suggests.
[Half of Russia's annual defense budget is spent on procuring new
weapons, modernizing old ones, and researching military
technology]{.underline}, which is a far greater share than is spent in
these areas by most Western militaries.
**[[Those]{.underline}]{.mark}**, moreover, **[[are conservative
estimates]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [since some Russian expenditures
remain hidden, obscured, or classified]{.underline}. Using these
generous budgets, [[the]{.mark} Russian [military]{.mark}-industrial
complex has [developed]{.mark} **many [next-gen]{.mark}eration
[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [from **[hypersonic]{.mark}
missile[s]{.mark}** to **[d]{.mark}irected-[e]{.mark}nergy
[w]{.mark}eapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} (such as lasers),
[**[e]{.mark}lectronic [warfare]{.mark} systems, advanced submarines,
[and]{.mark} integrated air defenses**, along with
**[a]{.mark}**]{.underline}nti**[[sat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ellite
weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** of various types.

The Russian military is not without its problems and remains a laggard
in some areas. In practice, however, [[Russia is]{.mark} well
[positioned to]{.mark} remain a dominant actor]{.underline} in the
post-Soviet space [and]{.underline} to [[**challenge U.S.
interests**]{.mark} in other regions, such as the Middle
East]{.underline}. Russia retains the airlift and sealift capabilities
needed to deploy its troops at some distance from its borders. Its
defense spending looks stable at current levels, despite the triple
shock of an economic recession, low oil prices, and international
sanctions. [[The]{.mark} Russian [military]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}still sees itself as a relative underdog, but it [[has **grown
more confident**]{.underline}]{.mark} that it can deter NATO even
without nuclear weapons, and the outcome of a prolonged war between
Russian and NATO forces is difficult to predict. [Under these
circumstances, the United States and its allies should **[stop
dismissing Russia]{.mark} as a mere "disrupter" [and recognize it as a
serious military adversary in]{.mark} both [ability and
intent]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

IT'S NOT JUST A PUTIN PROBLEM

Tied up in the narrative of Russian decline is the notion that the
United States primarily has a Putin problem---that once the Russian
president leaves office, his country's foreign policy will grow less
assertive. Yet that is unlikely to be the case. For one thing, Putin can
legally remain in office until 2036, thanks to a referendum that he
pushed through last year that allows him to serve two more six-year
terms after his current term expires in 2024. Research that one of us
(Kendall-Taylor) conducted with the political scientist Erica Frantz
showed that such longevity is common for leaders like the Russian
president. In the post--Cold War era, autocrats who, like Putin, had
made it to 20 years in office, were at least 65 years of age, and had
concentrated power in their own hands ended up ruling for 36 years, on
average.

Research on longtime authoritarian leaders also suggests that [once
Putin does depart]{.underline}---even if earlier than expected---[there
will be **little prospect for substantial political
improvement**]{.underline}. Most often, the [regimes that such longtime
leaders create **persist**]{.underline}, or a different dictatorship
emerges. [The odds that democratization will follow]{.underline} a
regime like Putin's---run by an older, personalist leader who has clung
to power for 20 years or more---[are **less than one in
ten**]{.underline}. [Extending term limits, as Putin did after last
year's referendum, is also a bad sign]{.underline}. According to data
from the Comparative Constitutions Project, 13 leaders around the world
pursued term-limit extensions in the period from 1992 to 2009. In all
but one case, their regimes either are still in power or simply
transitioned to a new authoritarian regime after the leader's departure.

This is not to suggest that Russia is doomed to authoritarianism or that
a change in the president would not matter. Nonetheless, [the empirical
record shows that the actions longtime authoritarian leaders typically
take to ensure control]{.underline}---such as undermining civil society
and hollowing out institutions that could constrain their
power---**[create barriers to the emergence of democracy]{.underline}**.
Likewise, [a mere change in leadership would likely matter only at the
margins]{.underline}. Unless Putin's departure ushers in a significant
turnover in the ruling elite, **[[key]{.mark} pillars of [Russian
foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as the notion that Russia
maintains the right to a sphere of influence in the post-Soviet space,
**[[will remain incompatible with]{.mark} the values of [the United
States]{.mark} and its allies]{.underline}**. Simply put, [American
policymakers must prepare for the possibility that the contours of
Russian foreign policy, and thus [the Kremlin's intent to **undermine
U.S. interests**, will endure]{.mark} long after Putin leaves
office.]{.underline}

THE PERSISTENT POWER

[The United States should [think of Russia]{.mark} not as a declining
power but [as]{.mark} a **persistent one**]{.underline}, **[[willing and
able to threaten]{.mark} U.S. [national security]{.mark}
interests]{.underline}** for at least the next ten to 20 years. Even if
China proves to be the more significant long-term threat, Russia will
remain a long-term challenger, too---a "good enough" power, as the
political scientist Kathryn Stoner has put it, with the ability to shape
global affairs and substantially affect U.S. interests. [[The former
Soviet space remains a **tinderbox**]{.underline}]{.mark}, still
reckoning with the dissolution of the Soviet Union[, which should be
[thought of **not as an event but** ]{.mark}**as a
[process]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as the historian Serhii Plokhy has
aptly put it. No matter how much [Washington]{.underline} would like to
focus on the Indo-Pacific, therefore, it [must [consider]{.mark} the
prospect of [another **Russian-Ukrainian war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [a
**military [conflict]{.mark}** []{.mark}resulting from political unrest
[in **Belarus**, or]{.mark} crises akin to the 2020 **[Nagorno-Karabakh
war]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Compared with China, [**[Russia]{.underline}**]{.mark} also
**[[poses]{.mark} a more significant [danger to the]{.mark} U.S.
[homeland]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For one thing, [[it remains
the]{.mark} United States' preeminent **[nuclear
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}, despite China's growing arsenal of
strategic nuclear weapons. The same goes for Russia's ability to reach
the continental United States with long-range conventional missiles.
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[[troops]{.mark} stationed abroad]{.underline} than does China, [with
bases [in the **Caucasus, Central Asia, Europe, and the Middle
East**]{.mark}, putting its military in regular proximity to U.S. and
NATO forces. When it comes to indirect warfare, [Moscow's]{.mark} record
of **[election interference]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}and hacking
demonstrates that it can **[and [will employ emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}** against the United States and its
allies. It is also worth underscoring that the Kremlin can endanger U.S.
interests on the cheap. [[Russia's]{.mark} military [interventions in
**Ukraine, Syria, and Libya**]{.mark} have been]{.underline} limited and
[inexpensive]{.underline}. So, too, are its cyberattacks and
disinformation efforts.

It is perhaps [in]{.underline} these domains---[cyberwarfare and attacks
on liberal democracy]{.underline}---where [[Russia is likely to]{.mark}
pose the most **sustained threat.**]{.underline} [Russia has refined a
low-cost toolkit]{.underline} that allows it **[to]{.underline}**
bolster other authoritarian regimes, [**[amplify illiberal
voices]{.underline}**]{.mark} in established democracies, **[[poison
info]{.mark}rmation [ecosystems, and subvert
elections]{.mark}]{.underline}** and other democratic institutions.
Since Moscow believes that weakening democracy can accelerate the
decline of U.S. influence, [it will persist in its efforts on this
front]{.underline}. Other states have taken note of Russia's success in
this sphere and have begun to emulate it, as shown by China's adoption
of Kremlin-style information warfare during the pandemic.

A final concern is that Moscow is increasingly finding common cause with
Beijing. In effect, the two governments have formed a strategic
partnership, exchanging technical and material support to offset Western
pressure and focus their resources on competing with the United States
rather than with each other. Their defense and military cooperation has
grown, too. The impact of this alignment will be greater than the sum of
its parts, amplifying the challenge to U.S. interests that each state
poses individually. The challenge, therefore, will be not just properly
prioritizing China and Russia in U.S. strategy but recognizing that the
problems presented by the two countries are not necessarily discrete and
separable.

RIGHTSIZING RUSSIA

**[Washington must [move past the myth that Russia
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}a beleaguered or
[**[cornered]{.underline}**]{.mark} state, lashing out in recognition of
its own demise. [In truth, there is little evidence that [Russia's
leaders]{.mark} see their country in this way]{.underline}---on the
contrary, [they [consider Russia]{.mark} to be the center of power in
its own region and an [**assertive**]{.mark} player
globally]{.underline}. Events such as the bungled U.S. withdrawal from
Afghanistan only reinforce Moscow's perception that it is rather the
United States that is in decline. [[Ignoring that]{.mark} view [will
create **false expectations for Russia's behavior**, leaving the United
States]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}and its allies [[**poorly
positioned**]{.mark} to anticipate Russian actions.]{.underline}
