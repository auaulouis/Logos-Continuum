\"political [decision for NATO]{.underline} Allies to make,\" they
added.

Britain and the United States have warned of potential cyberattacks on
Ukraine which could have international consequences should, for example,
malicious software designed to target networks in Ukraine start to
spread elsewhere. read more

[There has]{.underline} also [been concern among **cybersecurity
experts**]{.underline} that [Russia could team up]{.underline} with some
of the gangs [and]{.underline} people who [release **malicious
software**]{.underline}, such as malware used to hold Colonial Pipeline
to ransom in the United States last year.

[U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee]{.underline} Chairman Mark Warner
[said there were **no clear guidelines** on how **NATO**]{.underline}
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization) [should **respond**]{.underline},
should such an attack take place.

\"These are things that have been in hypothetical discussion for a
decade, but because we\'ve not come to any universal conclusion on what
those standards should be, what level of attribution is needed,
[we\'re]{.underline} kind of [in a very **grey area**]{.underline},\" he
told Reuters.

He posed the hypothetical case of a Russian cyberattack on Ukraine that
impacts NATO member Poland, triggering power outages that result in
hospital patients dying or knocking out traffic lights, causing fatal
road accidents involving U.S. troops deployed there.

\"The West may have wanted strategic ambiguity in this area, and that
may still be the right choice,\" he added.

\"But [have we sufficiently made clear to the Russians the **red lines
on cyber**]{.underline} or frankly to the NATO public, the American
public, on red lines on cyber? **[I don\'t think we\'ve done
that]{.underline}**.\"

Warner said he was \"pleasantly surprised\" [a **massive Russian
cyberattack**]{.underline} had not occurred. But he added that such an
attack \"[becomes even **more dangerous** with Putin elevating the
readiness of his **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}.\"

There are multiple ways [cyber conflict around]{.underline} the
[Ukrain]{.underline}ian invasion [might escalate into a **direct
conflict** between Russia and NATO]{.underline}, possibly as a result of
either side's offensives.

First, [Russian offensive cyber operations might spark a **wider
war**]{.underline}. President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} has declared
sanctions "are akin to a declaration of war" and [may see aggressive
cyber attacks as]{.underline} the [perfect]{.underline} response,
[particularly since they are reversible and non-lethal. Russia has been
entangled with Western economies]{.underline} for decades, especially in
the realms of energy and finance. [But now, as ties are being
severed]{.underline} quickly and viciously, [Russia no longer has to
fear the backlash if its cyber forces were to **disrupt Western banks**
or **l**]{.underline}iquified **[n]{.underline}**atural
**[g]{.underline}**as [terminals]{.underline}. If you are dealt out of
the game, why not just flip the table?

[Russia's cyber generals may be]{.underline} just as
[enthusiastic]{.underline} as their Army counterparts. [They may assure
Putin their forces are ready for battle and can]{.underline} quickly and
bloodlessly [get the West to back down]{.underline}. [Putin could be
convinced disruptive attacks]{.underline} against the West
[are]{.underline} no big deal, a **[low-cost signal]{.underline}** that
the West should de-escalate or just the next natural move in a
non-escalatory intelligence contest. After all, U.S. research found that
in response to cyber attacks, "Americans are less likely to support
retaliation with force" compared to a more traditional strike.

[This can lead to **escalation**]{.underline} in two ways. [The United
States]{.underline} --- [along with countries like the
U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom, France, and the Netherlands
--- [might]{.underline} well decide to **[defend]{.underline}** forward
against such attacks. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the commander of [U.S. Cyber
Comm]{.underline}and, has [insisted]{.underline} his [forces "must
**take this fight to the** enemy]{.underline}, just as we do in other
aspects of conflict." His then-deputy has also argued that [the United
States "**cannot cede any territory**"]{.underline} to adversaries [as
the "**Russians will keep pushing**]{.underline} until we push back on
them."

Worse, Dmitri Alperovitch recently warned that [if Russia launches cyber
attacks]{.underline} after "\[h\]aving already exhausted the power of
economic sanctions, [America and its European allies would have few
choices other than to **respond to these attacks**]{.underline} with
offensive cyber-strikes of their own." [Such dynamics can feed a
**spiraling escalation**]{.underline} in cyberspace [that might take on
a life outside of the control of policymakers]{.underline}.

Second, [Western offensive cyber operations might **spark
war**]{.underline}. U.S. cyber espionage and operations against Putin,
his cronies, or Russia's military forces will appear far more ominous to
Putin if he believes they are aimed at regime change. [Could Putin turn
the other cheek if the United States were to electronically raid the
cryptocurrency wallets of]{.underline} Russia's sanctions-avoiding
[kleptocrats]{.underline}? [He might feel the need to
**escalate**]{.underline} his own cyber operations as part of his own
version of defending forward.

**[Escalation could happen on the battlefield]{.underline}** as well.
According to the New York Times, teams from U.S. Cyber Command are "in
place to interfere with Russia's digital attacks and communications."
Other teams are almost certainly collecting digital intelligence on the
location and intent of Russian combat forces. The United States is
sharing such intelligence with the Ukrainians but apparently not yet
providing any real-time targeting. That may change soon, as the United
States seeks to alleviate intensifying attacks on civilians. And with
his KGB-bred paranoia, Putin might already see the presence of U.S.
defensive and intelligence teams operating on or against Russian
military networks as evidence of direct U.S. involvement in the war.
Confirming his apparent belief that Ukraine is just a NATO puppet, this
might force a response, either inside or outside of cyberspace.

Further, if Western governments have infiltrated Russia's operational
military networks, they may feel pressure to disrupt those networks to
prevent civilian massacres. Because cyber capabilities are billed as
non-lethal, reversible, and non-escalatory, tub-thumping newspapers may
push decision-makers to take shots they might not otherwise: "We can't
create a no-fly zone but can use cyber capabilities to prevent civilian
harm." Some well-meaning national leaders may succumb to this pressure,
potentially causing a larger conflict.

Future Risks

[Even if Russia and the West avoid]{.underline} direct [conflict this
time, they might not be so lucky the next. As relations
worsen]{.underline}, future [disruption of critical Western
infrastructure by Russian intelligence]{.underline}, such as the
NotPetya and Olympic Destroyer attacks, [are less likely to be viewed as
mere crimes]{.underline}. **[Repeated crises]{.underline}** bordering on
war **[may further erode]{.underline}** the tacit agreements and
relative **[restraint]{.underline}** of quieter times. After repeated
iterations of intensifying cyber operations, [both Russia and the West
may feel their backs to the wall with few options left other than
**military force** when]{.underline} the next crisis --- physical or
[cyber]{.underline} --- [emerges]{.underline}. Under extreme conditions,
some of the same characteristics that lead [cyber
capabilities]{.underline} to be a pressure release [might
have]{.underline} the opposite effect, a mechanism that Bob Jervis and I
have described as the [Escalation Inversion]{.underline}.

If [Putin]{.underline} believes a direct conflict with NATO is likely
and expects its adversaries to take measures to reduce vulnerabilities,
he [could]{.underline} conclude that the best possibility for success is
to [launch a]{.underline} massive **[preemptive cyber
attack]{.underline}**. Since the U.S. military may seem otherwise
unbeatable, this may lead Russia to "compensate with audacity in order
to redress the balance." The more the United States brags about its
overwhelming offensive cyber advantage, but frets over weak defenses,
the more any adversary might feel the need to target the United States
as early and as hard as possible.

If Russia fears war with the United States may happen on Saturday, it
might feel the need to get in its cyber punches on Friday. If the United
States thinks the same, it may need to start on Thursday. [Cyber
capabilities may be to World War III as mobilization timelines were to
World War I.]{.underline}

[Since a cyber sucker punch may]{.underline} also [seem less escalatory,
adversaries could be **tempted to take risks**]{.underline} they would
not otherwise. In this situation, [the sense that cyber is a
pressure-release]{.underline} valve [becomes]{.underline} positively
**[dangerous]{.underline}**: If the system is seen to be stable, then
there is less reason to act with restraint, thereby making it less
stable. Fortunately, the good news is leading U.S. policymakers appear
attuned to this risk.

Avoiding Escalation

How can Washington reduce the risk of cyber attacks escalating into a
direct conflict with Russia? First, by recognizing it. Cyber conflict
may be an intelligence contest or a pressure release in peacetime and
something quite different during or after a major war in Europe. Cyber
war may be far easier to stumble into when states fear the wolf at their
door.

Second, escalation control requires a better understanding of political
psychology --- specifically the mindset and desperation of one
inscrutable, increasingly isolated, and blood-covered tyrant. There were
more than enough expert commentators who believed that Putin would never
invade Ukraine because it objectively seemed so irrational. Assessments
of cyber escalation must also cover seeming irrationality, including the
misperceptions, mistakes, and miscalculations that can lead even the
most rational leaders to get caught up in an escalatory spiral that is
no longer under their control.

Third, preventing escalation requires military and intelligence leaders
to understand and respect cyber capabilities. Cyber capabilities are not
"magic invisible weapons" but rather real weapons with massive,
cascading consequences. They have a range of advantages and restrictions
that sober-minded national leaders should approach as they would any
other weapon.

Finally, [even if we dodge a bullet]{.underline} this time, [we should
**not become complacent**]{.underline}. Personally, I would put the
chances of cyber conflict escalating into a Russia--NATO war at less
than 10 percent. With luck, escalation will not happen, and I will be
written off as a "cyber catastrophist." ["Cyber doesn't work like that,"
we will tell ourselves]{.underline}. "Remember the lessons of the
Ukrainian cyber non-war. Cyber doesn't escalate. It isn't useful on the
battlefield or for coercing other states."

This will hopefully continue to be true for weeks or even years. [But
the world is in the first few decades of an **information age** that
will continue for a long time]{.underline}. [The **existential stakes**
of cyber conflict rise as more countries become more digitized and more
reliant on vulnerable information technology.]{.underline}

[It isn\'t hard to see why [NATO is worried about]{.mark} threats in
[cyberspace]{.mark}, given [Russia\'s]{.mark} recent use of on-line
attacks against Ukraine and other countries]{.underline} in a style of
combat that has come to be called \"hybrid warfare.\" However, a report
by the Pentagon\'s prestigious Defense Science Board released last year
suggests that the cyber challenge reaches far beyond the use of botnets
and distributed denial-of-service tactics. Describing the extensive
vulnerability of U.S. military forces to cyber assault, the report then
observed,

[The **[impact]{.mark}** of a destructive cyber attack]{.underline} on
the civilian population [[would be]{.mark} even [greater with **no
electricity, money, communications**]{.mark}, TV, radio or
[fuel]{.mark}]{.underline} (electrically pumped). In a short time,
[**[food and medicine]{.mark}** distribution systems would be
ineffective; **[transportation would fail]{.mark}**]{.underline} or
become so chaotic as to be useless. [**[Law]{.mark} enforcement, medical
staff, [and emergency personnel]{.mark}** capabilities [could be]{.mark}
expected to be barely functional]{.underline} in the short term and
[**[dysfunctional]{.mark}** over sustained periods]{.underline}.

[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} sustained [[periods]{.underline}]{.mark},
the science board stated, **[might last \"months or
years\"]{.underline}** as government and industry sought to rebuild
damaged infrastructure \-- [a possibility that led the panel to
[compare]{.mark} the specter of state-sponsored cyber attacks
[to]{.mark} the threat of **[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So if
you think that 56 million payment cards being compromised at Home Depot
is about as bad as cyber threats can get, think again. [Civilians and
soldiers alike have hardly begun to experience how **destructive** the
coming age of information warfare is going to be.]{.underline}

[The danger]{.underline} here is that [**economic attacks** of this
sort]{.underline}, if undertaken during a period of tension and crisis,
[**could lead to [an escalating series of tit-for-tat attacks]{.mark}**
[against]{.mark}]{.underline} ever more vital elements of an adversary's
[[**critical infrastructure**, producing]{.underline}]{.mark} widespread
**[[chaos]{.underline}]{.mark}** and harm and [[eventually leading one
side to **initiate kinetic attacks**]{.underline}]{.mark} on critical
military targets, [[risking the **slippery slope to nuclear
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, **[[a Russian
cyberattack]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the U.S. power grid [[could
trigger U.S. attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} on Russian energy and
financial systems, [[causing]{.underline}]{.mark} widespread
[**[disorder]{.underline}**]{.mark} in both countries [[and]{.mark}
generating an impulse for even **[more]{.mark} devastating
attacks**]{.underline}. At some point, [[such attacks "could lead
to]{.mark} major conflict and possibly [**nuclear
war**."]{.mark}]{.underline}14

#### \[[OPTIONAL]{.mark}\] Lack of [clarity]{.underline} about escalation increases the [probability]{.underline} of [nuclear use]{.underline}.

This reorientation might seem a positive development by possibly
lowering the threat of nuclear conflict. But this optimistic conclusion
is not clear-cut. To be sure, the destruction from massive cyberattacks
against critical infrastructure would be orders of magnitude less than
that caused by nuclear war. It is also true that calibrated
infrastructure cyberattacks provide additional pre-nuclear rungs to the
escalation ladder, possibly making resort to nuclear arms more remote.6
[Massive infrastructure cyberattacks]{.underline}, however,
[could]{.underline} nonetheless [cause catastrophic devastation, leading
to years of national hardship and considerable loss of life from the
collapse of food, water, medical, and other essential
systems]{.underline}.7 Moreover, [the very fact that such infrastructure
attacks avoid the unbounded cataclysm of nuclear war increases the
**likelihood that this cyber capability could be used**]{.underline},
potentially [to the great harm of the targeted state. Nor can the threat
of **retaliation with nuclear arms to an unrestrained cyberattack be
ruled out**, a possibility the United States]{.underline}, at least,
[appeared to invoke]{.underline} in the US 2018 Nuclear Posture Review.

[left the door open to **responding with nuclear weapons** to such an
attack]{.underline}.9

[Most]{.underline} Americans seem to [assume]{.underline} that [a cyber
attack]{.underline}, even [by]{.underline} an avowed adversary like
[Russia]{.underline} or Iran, [would be answered in
kind]{.underline}---that the U.S. would cause an annoying power outage
or a brief internet failure. But [[**experts** and]{.mark} former
intelligence and cyber-security [**officials** tell]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}Newsweek [that [hackers linked to Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}have launched cyber attacks on the U.S. that have
[[come]{.underline}]{.mark} frighteningly [[close to the red
line]{.underline}]{.mark}: a digital incursion [[that would prompt a
**deadly** ]{.mark}**real-life [response]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As the U.S. continues to prove vulnerable to ransomware attacks from
shadowy groups believed to be operating out of Russia or other former
Soviet bloc countries, [those with experience]{.underline} in
[advising]{.underline} the White House on challenges from the region
[urge Biden to take the opportunity to **send a message**]{.underline}.

\"What [[I want]{.underline}]{.mark} is for [[Biden to **very clearly
explain**]{.underline}]{.mark} what the risk is to Vladimir Putin,
**[that [we are not going to back down]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}if we are attacked by Russia,\" says Evelyn Farkas, who served
as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and
Eurasia, \"and that we\'re going to be the ones that decide what a
\'cyber Pearl Harbor\' is, which means Russia doesn\'t control the
escalation dynamic.\"

At least Japanese leaders knew that bombing Pearl Harbor would
inevitably provoke a military response. [[It\'s not clear]{.mark} that
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}or the
[[cyber-militants]{.underline}]{.mark} operating within its borders
[[have]{.mark} that [awareness]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}now. [[A
shooting war]{.mark} between Russia and the U.S.]{.underline}, avoided
for more than a half-century, [[would leave **only
losers**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [cyber warfare is]{.underline} so
[new]{.underline} that [[there\'s no agreed upon]{.underline}]{.mark},
widely understood [[Rubicon]{.underline}]{.mark}, as was established
during the Cold War with the use of traditional weapons of mass
destruction. (Think: Cuban Missile Crisis. After that near-catastrophe,
the two sides have played it safe.)

The [[lack of clarity]{.underline}]{.mark}---of a shared algorithm for
escalation---[[is **tinder** that could **easily turn into** ]{.mark}**a
deadly [fire]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In short, [there\'s]{.underline} a
growing [danger of a response **far more devastating**]{.underline} than
the temporary internet outage or compromised credit score or muddled
train schedule that Americans might think would be the worst-case
scenario.

Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn\'t directly run the hackers
who\'ve recently infiltrated high-level government networks and
paralyzed critical infrastructure. U.S. intelligence believes the
digital operatives behind those attacks work with the Russian
president\'s blessing but stay at arm\'s length---the better to give
Moscow plausible deniability. It\'s part of a familiar pattern:
Russian-affiliated groups have long harassed U.S. companies and
government agencies and even had a hand in swinging the 2016 election to
Donald Trump. The Biden administration has not directly accused the
Kremlin of sponsoring these attacks but blames the Russians allowing
such activity to continue.

The recent [[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to mark an
intensification. They tend to be more [focused [on **physical
infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}like food, oil and gas
pipelines, and hospitals, upon [which Americans rely every day for
their]{.underline} health and [economic well-being. The trend [has
**national security** ]{.mark}**analysts**
[worried]{.mark}]{.underline}. It\'s one thing to make Americans wait in
line at the pump or to hit hospitals with ransom bills that drive up the
cost of health care. It\'s something else entirely to cause real
economic harm and even loss of life. And yet, [[hackers]{.mark} seem to
be [flirt]{.mark}ing [with]{.mark} crossing]{.underline} what
[**[national security]{.underline}**]{.mark} experts say is a \"**[[red
line]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"

The red line was high on the agenda in the June 16 talks between Biden
and Putin. Biden handed the Russian president a list of no-go targets
upon which a cyber attack presumably might be considered an act of war
that demands retaliation. Although [it\'s not clear where that red line
is]{.underline}---the White House has not released the list---[[it\'s
not hard to imagine]{.mark} how easy it would be for
[hackers]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}acting with some degree of
autonomy from Moscow, and not directly answerable to the consequences of
their actions, [to [cross it]{.mark}]{.underline}. To take one example,
it\'s become a truism in cyber-security circles that hackers working
with the backing of the likes of Russia and China may have the ability
to cause a shutdown of a large swath of the U.S. electrical grid, which
could kill millions.

In other words, [[the next]{.mark} big [cyber attack could
trigger]{.mark} a **[war with Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and not the
virtual kind, but one [[**involving**]{.mark} troops, tanks, missiles,
aircraft carriers and]{.underline} possibly **[[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \"If a nation-state adversary were to
set foot on our homeland and physically destroy our infrastructure, we
would view this as an act of war,\" Brian Harrell, former Assistant
Director for Infrastructure Security at the U.S. Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), told Newsweek.

History of Russia's Cyberwarfare Against NATO Shows It Is Time to Add to

The [NATO]{.underline} Alliance [has served]{.underline} for over
seventy years not only [as a foundation of preventing armed attacks from
Russia and other major powers]{.underline} against most of Europe and
North America, but also [a foundation of one of the **most peaceful and
prosperous eras** in world history]{.underline}. But [there is one major
type of warfare that has been hitting NATO member states
intensely]{.underline} for years **[and increasingly]{.underline}** so:
**[cyberwarfare]{.underline}**. And [virtually all cybercampaigns of
this cyberwarfare have been waged by **Russia**]{.underline}, [part
of]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir Putin's overall [war
**against**]{.underline} the West, especially NATO but also even Western
**[democracy]{.underline}**.

Apart from some Chinese hacking/cyberespionage known to have begun at
least by 2003, the first two serious cyberassaults (in these cases
carried out much more so as part of geopolitical cyberwarfare campaigns)
were Hezbollah's and Israel's surprising cyberattacks against each other
during their 2006 war and Russia's less-surprising but far larger
cybercampaign against NATO-member Estonia in 2007, just three years
after it had joined the Alliance. It was not long after that when it
became clear Russia was absolutely a bad-faith actor with which we have
needed, since the last years of the George W. Bush Administration and
through the Obama and Trump Administrations, to take a much tougher
stance, as I have argued before.

Unsurprisingly, then, the two countries that have led in cyberwarfare
since are Russia and China, the first being the weaker of the two but
also NATO's (and America's) clearest top state enemy and the second
being the overall stronger of the two, but more restrained and America's
clearest top state rival for global power and influence. Though China
has conducted its own massive hacking and espionage operations (not
uncommon among major powers) and has its own influence operations, it is
[Russia]{.underline} that [has]{.underline} without question [been the
**dominant aggressor** with acts far more hostile than hacking
operations focused mainly on espionage]{.underline}. In fact, **[Russia
is unique among major powers]{.underline}** in [carrying out significant
acts of **hostile cyberwarfare**]{.underline} beyond espionage ever
since its Estonia campaign. And while espionage against NATO states is
bad for any of those states, espionage has long been viewed as separate
from acts of war and should remain in a different category from acts of
war in all but the most extreme of cases, a select level in which the
latest Russian cybercampaign (detected to be only espionage so far even
if at a historic level) seems begging to be included.

Since the Estonia campaign, [Russia become dramatically more
**aggressive against NATO**]{.underline}, often skillfully
**[manipulating nationalisms]{.underline}** (as I discussed recently)
[and **flooding NATO member states** with **cyberwarfare**, with
**election interference** and **boosting secessionism** as common
features]{.underline}. Notable cybercampaigns have been directed at the
United States, the United Kingdom (including the Scottish independence
and Brexit referenda), Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
Bulgaria, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic,
Canada, Turkey, Denmark, Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Montenegro, and even
(North) Macedonia, unsurprisingly focused there on preventing its recent
accession to NATO (and these do not even get into campaigns carried out
beyond NATO territory).

These [cybercampaigns involve thousands of Russian government
paid-trolls and Kremlin-created bots operating thousands of fake
accounts that create millions of Tweets, comments, and
posts.]{.underline} And the way [these operations]{.underline} tend to
work is by [promot]{.underline}ing [politicians and political parties
**coopted** or **compromised**]{.underline} by or even favorable to
Russia and Putin's agenda and slamming their opponents or anyone
critical of Russia and willing to stand up to Putin.

Many of the [parties]{.underline} getting the most help (including
funding) from Russia [exhibit]{.underline} the same hackneyed brand of
thoroughly boring **[right-wing ethnonationalism]{.underline}** of the
type embraced by Putin's own United Russia party, which has in recent
years forged alliances with several major political parties in Europe,
including in major NATO states Italy, Germany, and France (and there are
suspicions about the UK, where details of this remain redacted in the
recent British parliamentary Russia report). Similar political
interference efforts are known to extend beyond NATO countries.

Using its primary hybrid mix of disinformation, hacking, and propaganda,
and with a network that combines top Kremlin figures, shadowy Russian
government operatives, oligarchs in Putin's pocket, and various
state-linked media "outlets," [these operations have had far more effect
than most people in NATO countries realize]{.underline}: [helping to
sway the views of many millions and dramatically **distorting public
discussion**]{.underline}, politics, and policies in countries [on
everything from **Ukraine**]{.underline} (see the Hunter Biden "story,"
for years a Russian disinformation campaign) [**and Syria to sanctions**
and]{.underline} even the current coronavirus [pandemic]{.underline}.
This model is skilled at preying on ignorance and confirmation bias to
turn media outlets and citizens alike in these NATO states into Kremlin
allies, whether as unwitting "useful idiots" or witting Fausts. From
Donald Trump and France's Marine Le Pen and Brexit champion Nigel Farage
to Fox News' all-stars and "contrarian" journalists Glenn Greenwald and
Matt Taibbi, for a variety of reasons, extremists not only on the right
but also on the left embrace or parrot Kremlin talking points and
narratives after years of these effective influence operations, shaping
debate from both within the halls of government power and newsrooms,
corrupting and bending the debate to Russia's ends. [Russian
disinformation is]{.underline} thus [vastly amplified]{.underline} and
passed on further as misinformation by the duped and again as
disinformation by the corrupted so that public opinion, media, and even
laws [and policies become]{.underline} more **[anti-NATO]{.underline}**,
more **[anti-EU]{.underline}**, more **[anti-American]{.underline}**,
more **[pro-secession]{.underline}**, more **[pro-Russia]{.underline}**,
more **[pro-Putin]{.underline}** as a result. And [when the Kremlin's
candidates win, they]{.underline} and their allies may [spout Russian
disinformation]{.underline} to suit their ends, as former FBI
counterintelligence agent Asha Rangappa explains is the case with the
Trump Administration. [They]{.underline} can also can move to [obstruct
efforts to both investigate Russian infiltration and hold Russia
accountable for its cyberwarfare]{.underline}, with clear and
indisputable examples of late from the Trump Administration and Boris
Johnson's UK government as illustrated clearly in the Mueller report and
the aforementioned British parliamentary report, respectively. Even when
the Kremlin's chosen do not win, these Russian operations still manage
to weaken their victorious opponents and skew political atmosphere.

All [this has been]{.underline} the case to varying degrees from
Washington to Rome, from London to Berlin, **[weakening NATO and its
ability to collectively defend itself]{.underline}**. Over time, the
degree to which the pendulum has swung to more pro-Russian positions and
people has been nothing short of remarkable and very much in part
because of Russia's concerted cyberwarfare effort. And all this further
divides the Alliance and even member states' own societies internally,
which itself is also a major goal of Russia's.

**[Time to Adapt NATO's Article 5 for]{.underline}** the
**[Cyberwarfare]{.underline}** Era

Thus, what Russia and the Soviet Union before it had been unable to do
for decades with conventional armed forces Putin is now to a significant
degree accomplishing through cyberwarfare. And [while]{.underline} the
[NATO]{.underline} Allice [had been incredibly effective in preventing
and deterring armed attacks, it has]{.underline} had [a **dismal record
at**]{.underline} preventing and **[deterring
cyberattacks]{.underline}**, a trend that is only increasingly so as
Russia's cyberassaults become more and more brazen, with Russia's
only-just-detected massive months-long and ongoing cyberespionage
campaign (and perhaps much more than cyberespionage, we may discover
over time) making this only pathetically more obvious.

[While NATO's Article 5 does not exclude cyberwarfare]{.underline} from
being considered a pretext for a collective response, [it has not been
one in practice and the **extreme lack of clarity**]{.underline} or
cohesion **[from NATO]{.underline}** only **[has Russia acting on the
cyberwarfare front with impunity]{.underline}**.

To this end, [cyberwarfare]{.underline}---[including information
warfare]{.underline}---**[must be explicitly included in Article
5]{.underline}**, with "or cyberattack" added after the three instances
of "armed attack" in the Article.

I will elaborate much more on how this will work in the future, but for
now, even [this]{.underline} brief historical overview of the
intersection of NATO, Russia, and cyberwarfare [makes obvious the dire
need for a new approach for NATO to **reinvigorate a domain of
warfare**]{.underline} that has been nothing but a grand embarrassment
for the Alliance [in the face of sustained Russian aggression. Only with
a **new, clear, and bold policy** that make cyberattacks as off limits
as "armed attacks" can NATO continue to secure its members
states]{.underline} as it has for most of its history **[and reverse its
loss of power]{.underline}**, prestige, [and]{.underline} effectiveness
[Russia's]{.underline} relentless [cyberassaults have already initiated
and inflicted]{.underline}.

[[Europe]{.mark} is currently [experiencing]{.mark} escalating
**[political and military tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are
rekindling fears of [war between Russia and NATO]{.underline}. Any such
conflict [would]{.underline} inherently [include a [risk of **nuclear
weapons** use]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Stimson Center, partnered with
Project High Hopes, is examining the results of such nuclear exchanges
and, more importantly, developing initiatives to avoid such
catastrophes.

Vladimir [Putin has]{.underline} revealed that he was
[prepared]{.underline} to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine crisis and
would protect ethnic Russian populations through any means necessary.
[There are]{.underline} significant **[[ethnic Russian populations in
Estonia and Latvia]{.underline}]{.mark}** with a history of
disagreements and some conflict with the national governments. [Any
armed **[conflict between]{.mark} a [Russian secessionist
movement]{.mark} and a Baltic government** could provide Russia an
excuse for military intervention, which could easily **[devolve into a
war with NATO and]{.mark} a [risk]{.mark} of [nuclear
use]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Illustratively, one could [imagine]{.underline} a scenario we call
Escalation in Estonia, beginning with [the seizure by pro-Russian rebels
of local government buildings]{.underline}. Responding to an Estonian
request, **[[NATO mobi-lizes]{.underline}]{.mark}** against the rebels,
and Russian troops move across the border. [Desperate to end the
conflict]{.underline} before more NATO forces can arrive, in conformity
[with its [doctrine]{.mark} "**[escalate to deescalate]{.mark}**," the
Russians [launch]{.mark}]{.underline} two **[[nuclear-armed
missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}** on NATO forces. [NATO]{.underline}, in
turn, [responds with]{.underline} two **[nuclear bombs]{.underline}**
delivered by US B-2 bombers on Russian military headquarters within
Estonia. As a result, Tallinn is largely destroyed and nearly 100,000
civilians and military service men and women could be expected to die as
a result of the conflict and its aftermath.

Bradshaw, who will become NATO commander later this month, said
**[Russia posed a "hybrid threat" to NATO members]{.underline}**.

"[It's not just]{.underline} the threat of overt [military]{.underline}
attack, [but]{.underline} it's a raft of other measures, including
[covert, paramilitary, and non-military activities]{.underline}, some of
which will be [coordinated by the **intelligence arms** of
Russia]{.underline}," General Bradshaw added.

"And we as NATO need to have our antenna tuned to the signs that this
sort of hostile activity is going on."

He accused the Kremlin of "showing a proclivity to disobey the rules of
international relations" with its military incursion into Crimea and
alleged backing for rebels in eastern Ukraine.

"[We need to put in place]{.underline} thoroughly effective and
[**convincing deterrence** so that everybody knows where the red lines
are]{.underline}," General Bradshaw said.

"We are effectively building and sustaining military capability so that
we never have to use it."

Bradshaw's comments come against the backdrop of growing calls in the
United States for a thorough investigations of the Russian government's
broad campaign to secure the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president
-- and the nature and scope of contacts between several Trump's
surrogates and high-level campaign aides and operatives of the two
Russian intelligence services -- the FSB and the GRU. These two
organizations were behind the hacking campaign against the computer
systems of the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton's campaign.

[The unanimous conclusion of the]{.underline} seventeen [agencies making
up the U.S. intelligence community was that]{.underline} "We assess
Russian President Vladimir [Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016
aimed at the U.S. presidential election]{.underline}," in the words of a
report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

"[Russia's goals were to **undermine public faith in the US democratic
process**]{.underline}, denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her
electability and potential presidency.

"We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear
preference for President-elect Trump."

A recent report by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said
the "rise of fake news" emanating from Russia was a cause of growing
concern, pointing to the role of state-owned outlets Russia Today and
Sputnik in spreading Russian propaganda and fake news masquerading as
journalism.

[European intelligence agencies have said that Russia's success in
helping elect Trump]{.underline} to the presidency of the United States
[has emboldened Moscow to **replicated in Europe the methods it used in
its interference in the U.S.**]{.underline} presidential campaign.
[European security services have already seen signs of **Russia's
hacking** and **disinformation campaign** aiming to help **far-right,
ethno-nationalist, and populist politicians** win the coming elections
in France, the Netherlands, and Germany.]{.underline}

As is the case with Trump, [these politicians]{.underline} -- Marine Le
Pen and the National Front in France, the AfD (Alternative für
Deutschland) in Germany, and Geert Wilders and his Party of Freedom in
the Netherlands -- [aim to **weaken the West**]{.underline} by
undermining or **[dismantling]{.underline}** the two central pillars of
Western post-Second World War security and prosperity -- the system of
military alliances, including NATO, and [**the liberal international
economic order**, including the **EU** and the **WTO.**]{.underline}

Not coincidentally, as is the case with Trump, [the]{.underline} three
[European]{.underline} political [movements]{.underline} being helped by
Russia [are]{.underline} openly pro-Russian and [critical of Western
economic and political sanctions]{.underline} taken [to punish
Russia]{.underline} for its actions in Crimea and Ukraine.

#### Illiberal leaders [escalate hotspots]{.underline} and [fracture institutions]{.underline}\-\--ends the [cooperative world order]{.underline} which is key to solve [every global existential threat]{.underline}. 

Cassidi **Beck 20**. Masters Thesis in Political Science at Stellenbosch
University. "The Rise of Strongmen Leaders: A Threat to Global
Security".

[With the rise of]{.underline} Strongmen like **[Orban, Putin and
Erdogan]{.underline}**, where these [populists have **accessed
government**, a subsequent erosion of liberal democratic principles has
been followed]{.underline} (Albertazzi & Mueller, 2013:350).
**[Authoritarian countries are openly challenging global
rules]{.underline}** and ideas about freedom and making the case that
their socio-political systems work better than liberal democracy.
[These]{.underline} Strongmen [pose a "substantial negative effect on
democratic quality"]{.underline} (Huber & Schi\`mpf, 2017:146 as [they
"increasingly reject liberal values"]{.underline} (Cederman, 2019:61).

Even if one disagrees with Francis Fukuyama's thesis, there is still
evidence that highlights that, despite its shortcomings, [democracy
inherently has important tenants]{.underline} that other regimes do not
offer. [Democracy stresses the intrinsic importance of **transparency,
civil liberty, rule of law, horizontal accountability, and minority
rights**. It **guarantees fundamental rights**]{.underline} and civil
liberties -- freedom to pursue one's legitimate interests, to hold
political, social and cultural beliefs, and to be able to express them
without interference from the state (Albertazzi & Mueller, 2013:350;
Mounk & Fao, 2018). High-minded defenders of liberal democracy argue
that [there is something uniquely legitimate about the political
system]{.underline}. Its democratic element, they claim, ensures
citizens' equality, while its liberal element ensures citizens' freedom.
As such, the genius of liberal democracy is that it can honour both
these values simultaneously. It allows each citizen access in the public
sphere while giving them the ability to have a private life; "only
liberal democracy can fulfil some of the deepest and most universal
human aspirations" (Mounk, 2018:129-130).

Thus, in conclusion, the use of Fukuyama's original essay The End of
History and the Last Man is not to disagree with or critique his thesis.
It is rather a reflection on his thesis and posits that political events
currently arising pose an obstacle to this perceived future. Rather, to
highlight that current events, specifically the rise of political
Strongmen, are incompatible with a future that was believed to be marked
by democracy, stability and security. The turbulence of current
geopolitics does not have to be read as a rebuttal of Fukuyama's
original thesis, however, an assessment of Strongman leadership and the
fluctuations such leadership may bring towards geopolitics are an
important contrast to what Fukuyama predicted. The next section will
examine more specifically the possible outcomes these Strongmen could
have on geopolitical security -- the ramifications of their tendency to
erode democratic institutions, to violate human rights, promote
nationalistic populism and break the principle of sovereignty and
international law.

4.3. The Strongman's Ramifications for Geopolitical Security

Although the rise of the Strongman and their **[illiberal
democracy]{.underline}** offers an alternative to democracy, their
actions, policies and leadership style indicate that they [**pose a risk
to geopolitical security**. In an increasingly connected and globalised
world, what appears to be local in nature is in fact global in impact as
most elements contain global dimensions]{.underline} (Kaldor, 2001).
[These rising and existing Strongmen across the globe and their
leadership style has the potential of **negative ramifications for
global security**]{.underline}. The [actions]{.underline} undertaken [by
leaders]{.underline} such as Putin, Orban and Erdogan towards democratic
institutions, human rights and international law, as well as their
nationalistic populism [will likely have a **far-reaching
impact**]{.underline}. As noted in Chapter Three, in a regional capacity
[these leaders have not only undermined their nations' democracy but
have also created an **environment of hostility and
insecurity**]{.underline}. Reflecting on Chapter Three, the next section
will examine how [these]{.underline} Strongmen's ability to [create
regional instability could possibly lead to **geopolitical instability
and insecurity**.]{.underline}

4.3.1. A New Global Order

US [Hegemony]{.underline} or "the American century" was born amid the
collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the Cold War (King,
2017:215; Zakaria, 2019:10). Following the collapse of communism, it
seemed the West's model of liberal democracy and free-market capitalism,
supported by a clear set of US-sponsored international rules, would
spread across the globe. Under the guise of the Washington Consensus, it
[laid the foundations for recommendations on how nations should interact
with one another on the premise of **creating wealth and championing
liberal democracy**]{.underline} (Banos, 2017:92; Rose, 2019:11). In the
advocating of the Washington Consensus, the foundation of
[**international law** was said to be based on the principles of mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity;
non-aggression]{.underline} towards others,
[non-interference]{.underline} in the internal affairs of others,
equality [and]{.underline} mutual benefit, [peaceful co-existence,
respect for human rights and basic freedoms and national
self-determination]{.underline} (Banos, 2017; King, 2017; Rose,
2019:11).

However, politically and economically, the West's vision has seemed to
reach its limits, as geopolitical and ideological rivals undermine the
foundations of the liberal world order (Frankopan, 2018:52; Kazan &
Park, 2019; Russell-Mead, 2018:15). Mounting opposition from emerging
superpowers, increasing resistance to globalisation and the core tenants
of liberal democracy from emerging political movements, and the rise of
political Strongmen across the world, could lead to the creation of a
new world order. This rebalancing of power with [Strongmen]{.underline}
at the helm [could have potential implications for global security, as
nations like]{.underline} Russia, **[Hungary and Turkey]{.underline}**
[forge their own political orthodoxy]{.underline} (Banos, 2017:121;
Frankopan, 2018:147; Weiss, 2019:92).

Evidence suggests that [**the new world order**, one not championed by a
liberal consensus, could potentially lead to a **more insecure
geopolitical future**. This]{.underline} argument [extends from the
Strongman's tendency to **reject the international rules-based system**,
as]{.underline} previously [noted by]{.underline} Putin, Erdogan and
Orban's **[dismissal of international law, treaties and the core
principle of sovereignty]{.underline}**. While the new world order will
still be based on a foundation of rules, scholars argue that with
Strongmen becoming more prominent and powerful, [the resulting new norm
will be characterised by **geopolitical competition, doubts about
security commitments to allies, challenges to the fundamentals of the
global trading regime and the abandoning of the promotion of freedom and
democracy**; these will become the **defining features** of a new
foreign policy]{.underline} (Daalder & Lindsay, 2018:72; Haass, 2019:30;
Kazan & Park, 2019). As Orban, Putin and Erdogan have shown, [there will
be little regard for democratic institutions and tenants, civil rights
and political freedoms will be restrained while international law and
the principle of sovereignty will hold little value. This could have the
potential of **escalating rivalries** and thus create **unstable
implications for global security**]{.underline} (Frankopan, 2018:144).

[This new global order could]{.underline} also potentially [see the end
of]{.underline} important [**international institutions and treaties**,
such as the Trans-Atlantic partnership, the EU,]{.underline} the
[W]{.underline}orld [T]{.underline}rade [O]{.underline}rganisation
[and]{.underline} the [I]{.underline}nternational [M]{.underline}onetary
[F]{.underline}und. International [institutions are important as they
provide the framework within which countries can **happily
engage**]{.underline} with each other **[and]{.underline}**, help
**[co-ordinate]{.underline}** the actions of different countries in
order to set stable expectations (Blackwill & Harris, 2016:74;
Frankopan, 2018:237). [Treaties and international
institutions]{.underline} also help to **[foster security]{.underline}**
as they provide frameworks through which countries interact, [creating
cooperation, helping to foster mutual **understanding and
stability**]{.underline} (Haass, 2019:30; Frankopan, 2018:222; King,
2017:225). [They]{.underline} also help [foster **global
security**]{.underline} as through their **[creating]{.underline}** of
[**cooperation** they help to ensure a **global response to the creation
of solutions for global problems**.]{.underline}

Many global issues and threats such as **[climate change, the refugee
crisis]{.underline}**, growing **[terrorism and]{.underline}** rising
socioeconomic **[inequalities require]{.underline}** the
**[harmonizing]{.underline}** of domestic and foreign
**[policies]{.underline}** and the willingness of countries to work
together. Therefore, [without established and agreed upon
**institutions**, the way in which states interact]{.underline} with
each other [could]{.underline} potentially [be]{.underline}
characterised as **[strained]{.underline}** and difficult. [Future
security threats demand a more **pluralistic response**]{.underline}
that can be best accomplished by combining resources (Drozdiak, 2017:91;
Frankopan, 2018:74). [Prosperity]{.underline} and well-being [may depend
on **global solutions**]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, under the
guise of [leaders like **Orban**]{.underline}, Putin and Erdogan, many
politicians and governments **[are taking steps to diminish
co-operation]{.underline}** with each other, **[disengaging
from]{.underline}** bilateral agreements and **[international
co-operation]{.underline}**. Instead [these leaders **erode confidence**
in international institutions]{.underline} and perceptions of stability
as they "operate on a tornado of impulses" (Frankopan, 2018:157). As
[the Strongman is more likely to choose **aggression**]{.underline} and
isolationism [**over collaboration and cooperation**, the world could
possibly descend into further **conflict as frictions are
elevated**]{.underline} (Haass, 2019:30; Kazan & Park, 2019; King,
2017:244).

[A world order led by]{.underline} Russia under Vladimir
**[Putin]{.underline}**, with the support of Turkey's Erdogan and
Hungary's Orban, [would]{.underline} possibly [be]{.underline} one
[characterised by **competition**]{.underline} over cooperation,
**[protectionism]{.underline}** rather than free trade,
**[authoritarianism]{.underline}** rather than democracy. Henceforth,
evidence suggests that [the possible thawing of the liberal democratic
world order could be problematic to geopolitical security]{.underline}
(Mounk, 2018:114).

An extension of this new global order and how it could potentially lead
to increased geopolitical security is that the Strongman's disregard for
democratic norms is contributing to a growing sense of license among
autocrats worldwide (Diamond, 2019:20). [As more Strongmen come to power
and are able to enact their policies, **their 'successful
run'**]{.underline} at authoritarianism **[is making it easier for it to
thrive elsewhere]{.underline}**. Albright (2018:246) argues that [herd
mentality is powerful within international affairs and if one leader can
follow a specific form of leadership, other leaders around the world are
likely to **observe and mimic**]{.underline}. Thus, with growing
assertiveness, disregard for international law yet few consequences and
increased economic success, [**more leaders are turning towards the
'Strongman playbook'.** Strongmen]{.underline} such as Putin, Orban and
Erdogan look to others for help in endorsing their regime, favouring
one's authoritarian adversaries over democratic allies (Albright,
2018:246; Mounk, 2018:2). Nudging followers away from the consensus and
support for democratic norms, these leaders **[portray an image that
this type of illiberal, autocratic leadership is
acceptable]{.underline}** (Lendvai, 2017:198). Once where a nation may
have consistently held another nation and its leadership in discontent,
once in power, the strongman may reverse this decision and instead seek
to build a trusting, cooperative relationship (Kearns, 2018:4). For
instance, despite the actions of some states towards the negation of
human rights and democracy, Russia under Putin has increasingly used its
power status to shield other authoritarian states from international
demands to protect human rights and block interventions that would force
governments to end abuses (Weiss, 2019:95). [By allowing nations to
continue with their erosion of human rights and political freedoms of
its citizens **without consequences**, it signals to other authoritarian
states and Strongman leaders that their actions are **acceptable**.
This]{.underline} then [can]{.underline} potentially [lead to the
possibility of an increased scale across the globe of **human rights
abuses**]{.underline} as autocratic [states are not fearful of harmful
consequences]{.underline}. Henceforth, this could have serious
implications for geopolitical security as more states negate human
rights.

When these actions come from [democratic]{.underline} countries that
have before been strong advocates of democracy, this [**reversal** can
have a harmful effect]{.underline} (Albright, 2018:218), particularly in
countries where there are already few checks on executive power. The
issue with a leader showing these characteristics, especially in a free,
liberal and democratic society, is that it signals to other leaders all
over the world with these autocratic tendencies are acceptable. If one
leader can argue that the press always lies, or the democratic
institutions are erroneous, it becomes difficult to fault another across
the globe when they make the same claim (Albright, 2018:5; Nance, 2018).

For example, on the invasion of the Ukraine and the illegal annexation
of Crimea, leaders across the globe praised Russia's decision. The
leader of the Hungarian fascist party Jobbik praised Putin and Greece's
Golden Dawn praised Russia for defending Ukraine from "ravens of
international usury" and France's Front National lauded Putin's
courageous position against the international lobby (Snyder, 2018:149).
With Putin's actions, and the endorsement he received from other
nations, the impression is given that breaking international laws and
sovereignty is acceptable.

Together, these Strongmen are creating an alliance of nations led by
strong authoritarian leaders who will increasingly pose a risk to the
liberal, democratic world order as democratic states fail to stand up to
this alliance or prove to be more successful (Lendvai, 2017:214; Nance,
2018). **[The current world order has not completely
eroded]{.underline}** but is spearheaded by the rise of Strongmen into
political power. [The **possibility of a new global order emerges** --
one that appears to create significant geopolitical
insecurity]{.underline}. While [the Washington Consensus]{.underline}
may be faulted, it [did help foster a global environment of cooperation
and consideration between states, while helping to promote the
principles of liberal democracy. A stable world order requires a stable
distribution of power and **broad acceptance of the rules that govern
the conduct of international relations**]{.underline} (Haass, 2019:22).
However, what the [Strongmen]{.underline} champion poses a [risk to
increased geopolitical insecurity as their policies and ideologies are
often **centred on conflict, isolationism and
protectionism**]{.underline}. Instead, **[they foster a world of
unbalanced power]{.underline}** and the formulation of their own rules.
Further, as more and more nations create a coalition of Strongmen, it
will become increasingly difficult to not only stand up to them but also
to foster democracy and stability (Kazan & Park, 2019). In a world of
'complex interdependence' (Rose, 2019:19), nations cannot fully operate
in isolation and such attitudes that fail to acknowledge this and
instead foster relationships based on self-interest can only create
instability.

[Deterrence in cyber age]{.underline}

Together, [NATO countries have become better at defending
themselves]{.underline} against dangers [in cyber space]{.underline}.

But **[we should not be content with]{.underline}** just **[making
ourselves tougher targets]{.underline}** -- crucial though that is. [Our
primary goal must be to **deter**]{.underline} this kind of behaviour
from happening in the first place.

[NATO]{.underline} is the most successful military alliance in history
precisely because of our collective power of [deterrence]{.underline},
and that [**prevented nuclear war** and helped to **keep the
peace**]{.underline} for 70 years. Our profound insight is [that
strength is the **surest guarantee of peace**]{.underline} -- and [when
we stand together, **no aggressor can hope to win** a war so it **never
makes sense to start one**.]{.underline}

[The challenge]{.underline} today [is]{.underline} therefore [to apply
the eternal verities at the heart of NATO's success to the Alliance's
newest operational domain]{.underline}. And **[that means
deterrence]{.underline}** -- [strengthening]{.underline} our joint
[ability to **deter**]{.underline} those who would harm our citizens
**[in cyberspace]{.underline}**.

We have already made important progress.

In 2014 the Allies agreed that a cyber attack could result in the
invoking of Article V of the Washington Treaty, meaning that the
incident would then be treated as an attack on every member of NATO.

The North Atlantic Council would take any such decision on a
case-by-case basis. Britain was the first ally to offer our offensive
cyber capabilities to NATO. Another 8 countries have since done the
same.

Then in 2016, NATO leaders endorsed the Cyber Defence Pledge,
recognising the 'new realities of cyber threats'.

But [we]{.underline} can and [must do more to improve our
response]{.underline}. In particular, **[we should be more emphatic
about what we consider to be unacceptable behaviour and the
consequences]{.underline}** for any breach of international law.

[Interference in free elections]{.underline}

[At particular risk are the **democratic processes in all**]{.underline}
of our **[countries]{.underline}**.

[In the cyber age, authoritarian states possess ways of **undermining
free societies** that dictators of earlier]{.underline} times [would
have envied]{.underline}. Time and again, [we have seen attempts by
states to **interfere in democratic elections**]{.underline}, often
through the use of proxies.

[In 2014, Russian hackers]{.underline} calling themselves 'CyberBerkut'
[sought to disrupt the presidential election in Ukraine]{.underline},
including by tampering with the voting system and delaying the final
result.

[In 2016, the Russian state interfered in the presidential election in
the United States]{.underline} with the aim of damaging one party's
candidate.

**[Free elections are at the heart of]{.underline}** our way of
[**life**. The leaders and ministers of NATO countries have been raised
up by]{.underline} the decisions of millions of [voters]{.underline},
expressed through the ballot box. [We can all be cast down in the same
way]{.underline}.

But recent events demonstrate that [**our adversaries** regard
democratic elections as a **key vulnerability**]{.underline} of an open
society. [If cyber interference were to become commonplace, the danger
is that **authoritarian states would damage public confidence** in the
very **fabric of democracy**.]{.underline}

[We cannot]{.underline} afford to **[wait until]{.underline}** one of
**[our adversaries succeeds]{.underline}** in changing the result of an
election. [We must be **crystal clear** that any cyber operations
designed to manipulate another country's electoral system and alter the
result]{.underline} would breach international law -- and **[justify a
proportionate response]{.underline}**.

Together, we possess options for responding to any attacks that fall
below the threshold for Article V. We should be prepared to use them.

[Deciding to do nothing would be an important decision in
itself]{.underline} -- and **[the consequences could be
escalatory]{.underline}**.

[The more we **communicate our resolve to act**]{.underline}, the more
**[we lower the risk of miscalculation]{.underline}**. [The more
we]{.underline} work together to develop an array of appropriate
response options -- and **[signal our willingness to employ
them]{.underline}** -- [the greater our power of
**deterrence**]{.underline}.

As always, we need to balance clarity about our determination to act
with constructive ambiguity about exactly what we would do in specific
circumstances.

The EU gained one further option last week when we adopted a new
sanctions regime, allowing the imposition of travel bans and asset
freezes on those who carry out 'cyber attacks with a significant
effect'.

In conclusion let us remember that throughout history, every new
technology has created risks and hazards. The problems have often seemed
daunting; the responses costly or uncertain. Yet so far, despite such
challenges, we have always been equal to dealing with every advance.

So [it must prove this time as we strengthen and adapt NATO's power of
**deterrence**]{.underline} -- our priceless asset -- [to meet the
challenge of the **cyber age**.]{.underline}

At the outset of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
([NATO]{.underline}) founding, the original 12 Western nations included
[Article 5]{.underline} within the Washington Treaty, which
[codified]{.underline} the concept of **[collective
self-defense]{.underline}**, first featured in the Charter of the United
Nations of 1945.\[1\] [NATO Article 5 provides that "an armed attack
against one or more]{.underline} of \[the NATO allies\] in Europe or
North America [shall be considered an attack against them
all]{.underline}...."\[2\] In the event of an armed attack against a
NATO Party, "each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or
collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the
United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
forthwith . . . such action as it deems necessary, including the use of
armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic
area."\[3\] Although only formally invoked once,\[4\] **[Article 5 is
the main pillar of NATO]{.underline}**, [and serves as a
**deterrent**]{.underline} against hostilities by non-NATO nations and
non-state actors.

Since NATO's creation in 1949, the manner in which nations engage in
warfare has changed dramatically. This evolution includes incorporation
of cyberspace into conducting warfare and securing national defense. For
instance, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Aaron Hughes recently
testified before the Congress that "\[the Department of Defense\] relies
heavily on cyberspace for virtually everything we do."\[5\] Possibly the
most blatant use of cyberspace in modern warfare occurred on December
23, 2015, when the Ukrainian power grid experienced major disruption
from a sophisticated external cyber attack, largely rumored to be linked
to the Russian Federation's hostile occupation and annexation of
Crimea.\[6\]

In an expression of NATO's current abilities to counter advanced armed
attacks, the Heads of State and Government of the North Atlantic Council
issued the Wales Summit Declaration (Wales Declaration) on September 5,
2014. In the Wales Declaration, the Heads of State and Government
outlined the threat of cyber threats and attacks, reaffirming NATO's
policy of "prevention, detection, resilience, recovery, and
defence."\[7\] The Wales Declaration further stated that the norms of
international law, which include humanitarian law (jus in bello) and the
UN Charter, directly apply to the realm of cyberspace.\[8\] [At the core
of]{.underline} these [international norms is the concept of
**collective self-defense** incorporated in NATO Article 5]{.underline}
and UN Charter Article 51. The Wales Declaration concluded by providing
that NATO Article 5 in fact applies to cyber attacks, as determined by
the North Atlantic Council on a "case-by-case basis." Less than a year
later, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated that a cyber
attack could amount to an armed attack and trigger Article 5's
collective defense provisions.\[9\]

[Although NATO has declared Article 5's application to certain cyber
attacks, the manner in which the North Atlantic Council will assess each
cyber attack remains **ambiguous**]{.underline}. [The **lack of
predetermined standards** for assessing cyber attacks poses **issues for
NATO countries**, which all hold **various and differing internal
criteria**]{.underline} for countering cyber attacks. [To remove this
ambiguity, NATO should **strive toward adopting a uniform
standard**]{.underline} for assessing individual cyber attacks to
determine whether each attack rises to the level of an armed attack.
[Without adopting these measures, the North Atlantic Council will likely
face **internal strife** among member nations while simultaneously
facing **external pressures** during a major cyber event]{.underline}.

NATO Article 5: An Outdated Tool in the Age of Cyber Aggression

As with any international treaty, the Washington Treaty is a product of
its historical and technological context. Directly after World War II
and at the dawn of the Soviet Union, the NATO allies sought to counter
Soviet aggression in the Euro-American region. After the Soviet Union
disbanded, NATO began preventing non-state actors from infiltrating NATO
territories while also expanding its operations to regions like the
Middle East.\[10\] Although NATO continues to use the express language
of Article 5 to govern all forms of armed attacks, cyber attacks pose a
new and unique obstacle. Cyber attacks are different than traditional
methods of warfare because while they often have devastating
consequences for the targeted nation or private entity, they rarely
result in physical events like the cyber event in Ukraine.

Secretary General Stoltenberg's announcement regarding the application
of international law to cyberspace signifies that the doctrine of jus in
bello, which regulates the proper conduct for waging war, also governs
how nation states use cyber attacks. Traditional principles of jus in
bello include the rules of proportionality and distinction, which
dictate how a nation targets oppositional force while avoiding
unnecessary civilian casualties.\[11\] If NATO seeks to enforce the
application of international law to cyberspace, the North Atlantic
Council will face much difficulty in using Article 5 to define when a
cyber attack reaches the threshold of an armed attack based on these
doctrines.

Article 5 is useful for assessing state and non-state actions used in
traditional warfare. However, the [NATO]{.underline} allies [drafted
Article 5 in light of]{.underline} the [technology]{.underline} and
tactics [of the World War II era]{.underline}. While [NATO]{.underline}
continued to successfully adapt Article 5 to the evolving challenges
post-Soviet Union, it [cannot]{.underline} properly [invoke]{.underline}
the principle of [collective self-defense against cyber attacks
**without**]{.underline} at least [**new definitions** for]{.underline}
the various forms of [cyber]{.underline} events. In particular, [without
unambiguous guidelines for]{.underline} identifying from where a
[cyber]{.underline} attack originated, [NATO will face
**difficulty**]{.underline} in both locating the origin of a cyber
attack and determining whether the cyber attack was sanctioned by the
host nation. Also, [without **proper definitions**]{.underline} for the
various forms of cyber attacks, [NATO will]{.underline} likely
[encounter **unnecessary debate between NATO allies over any cyber
attack**]{.underline} against a NATO country. Furthermore, [without
removing **ambiguity**]{.underline} in identifying cyber events that
equate to a traditional armed attack, [the North Atlantic Council will
face difficulty in deciding upon a **proper and proportionate armed
response** in accord with the principles of jus in bello]{.underline}.

[Currently, almost every NATO ally has an **individual**]{.underline}
national **[security]{.underline}** and defense [**strategy** related to
cybersecurity]{.underline}.\[12\] [These strategies
**vary**]{.underline} in detail and scope, **[and lack
uniformity]{.underline}** in defining the elements of which cyber
attacks warrant an aggressive response. Some scholars argue that the
International Court of Justice accurately determined that collective
self-defense is triggered when an act "inflicts substantial destruction
upon important elements of the target state," even if the attackers used
non-traditional weaponry like airplanes or cyber attacks.\[13\] For
instance, this "scale and effects" test does not adequately address the
technical differences between using cyberspace to create either a
kinetic disruption to a power plant or the potential to dismantle an
entire financial infrastructure with zero physical effects. [The
potential for a single cyber attack to result in major
disturbance]{.underline}, with or without any physical element, [is
sufficient to warrant **specific guidelines**]{.underline}. However, [as
long as the North Atlantic Council assesses individual cyber attacks on
a case-by-case basis **without predetermined specialized rules**, the
various interests of all 28 NATO nations will pose **obstacles** for a
**swift and efficient NATO response**.]{.underline}

The Adoption of Cyber Attack Guidelines to Supplement Article 5

[To]{.underline} properly **[dissuade and combat]{.underline}** future
**[cyber attacks]{.underline}**, [NATO should adopt cyber attack
guidelines to **reduce ambiguity** and address the uniqueness of cyber
aggression]{.underline}. In doing so, NATO will afford all member
nations a unified procedure in which the North Atlantic Council may
examine cyber attacks. [This does not necessarily mean that bright line
rules should be adopted]{.underline}. According to Department of State
Coordinator for Cyber Issues M.E. Painter, "\[a\]s a general matter,
states have not sought to define precisely (or state conclusively) what
situations would constitute armed attacks in other domains, and there is
no reason cyberspace should be different."\[14\] [Instead]{.underline},
Coordinator Painter argues that nations like **[the United States should
define specific "norms of responsible behavior" for
cyberspace]{.underline}** that embrace traditional international law
[while adapting them to the intricacies of
cyberspace]{.underline}.\[15\]

While Coordinator Painter speaks on behalf of the United States
Government, his ideas of broad norms created specifically for regulating
cyberspace is an important concept that NATO must at least consider for
a framework dictating proper identification of cyber attacks,
understanding whether a cyber attack rises to an armed attack under
Article 5, and what are the proportional responses to such attacks. The
United Nations has already embraced this line of thinking by issuing its
annual Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in
the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of
International Security (UN GGE Report). The most recent UN GGE Report
included several U.S. recommendations for how nations should and should
not utilize information and communications technologies.\[16\]

Following the United Nations' example, [NATO should]{.underline} also
[form cyber attack guidelines that illustrate a set of norms related to
cyberspace, but focus solely on **cyber attacks, Article 5, and jus in
bello**]{.underline}. [NATO can form the first coherent set of
international guidelines]{.underline} for cyber attacks,\[17\] [which is
vital for maintaining **dominance in the international
sphere**]{.underline}. NATO should begin its formation of the guidelines
by analyzing the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to
Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual). Issued in 2013 for the benefit of NATO,
experts in international law comprised "black letter" rules
incorporating traditional jus in bello principles to cyber
warfare.\[18\] Although the Tallinn Manual is not binding legal
authority, it offers international organizations the best attempt at
combining international law with the new realm of cyberspace. In
consulting the Tallinn Manual, [NATO should begin to draft binding
authority]{.underline} for the North Atlantic Council [in the form of an
amendment to the Washington Treaty]{.underline}, or at least a
persuasive document codified within NATO's Military Committee or Allied
Command Operations. [By **codifying principles**]{.underline} similar to
those included in the Tallinn Manual, [NATO would]{.underline}
drastically **[reduce]{.underline}** the **[ambiguity]{.underline}**
surrounding the current case-by-case analysis identified in the Wales
Declaration.

The formation of binding cyber attack guidelines for all NATO members
and the North Atlantic Council will not be an easy task. As stated
earlier, each NATO nation has independently formed its own set of
standards for combating cyber aggression. Individualization among
members will assuredly create friction in drafting these guidelines.
However, [NATO would be wise to **begin the process** before these
individualized standards become too offensive for a uniform NATO
procedure.]{.underline}

Conclusion

The evolution of modern warfare shows that as weaponry becomes more
advanced, nations attempt to curtail their devastating effects. To this
point, international treaties and protocols, like the Geneva Protocol
prohibiting asphyxiating and poisonous gases in battle,\[19\] tend to
follow atrocities on the battlefield. Though only in the early stages of
use for military purposes, cyberspace offers a unique opportunity to
break the trend of following devastating events. [By adopting a set
standard before a major cyber attack is used against a NATO member, NATO
may curtail these potential attacks by offering non-NATO members a
**clear set of rules**]{.underline}. These [rules may serve as a
**deterrent**]{.underline} for these cyber attacks while simultaneously
[limiting the time in which NATO may effectively and proportionately
respond]{.underline}.

First, [the Alliance should consider reformulating **Article
5**]{.underline} of the Treaty. Currently the article only speaks of 'an
armed attack' against one or more of the members. [Cyber-attacks do not
necessarily 'fit]{.underline} the picture' of conventional, armed
attacks. [Therefore the definition should be changed. Collective
self-defense mainly functions as a deterrent against potential
adversaries. To **maximize the impact of the deterrent**, its underlying
doctrine should leave **no room for guessing**. It should **specifically
include cyber-attacks**]{.underline}.

Second, [the Alliance should come up with a **clear doctrine on what
constitutes an attack**]{.underline} that would qualify the invocation
of Article 5, and what would be an accepted retaliatory action. Although
this is important concerning conventional attacks as well, it becomes
even more pressing for cyber-attacks. Everyone understands it is
unacceptable to bomb a country as a reaction to petty cybercrime, but
[what if an actor succeeds in shutting down important parts of the
economy of a country -- for example the New York Stock Exchange? An
option could be to **openly formulate clear redlines to maximize the
deterrent**]{.underline}. [Some]{.underline} however [say]{.underline}
that a dose of strategic [ambiguity is more important]{.underline},
arguing that formulating clear redlines would invite potential
adversaries to push up to the red line. [In this case developing the
**doctrine is still important**, but would then be for internal use
only.]{.underline}

Third, the Alliance should further focus on information sharing and
mutual assistance concerning the cyber domain. [Putting cyber on top of
the agenda will give a **clear signal to all NATO
members**]{.underline}, especially those who are lagging behind. It is
time to not only invest in our conventional capabilities; we have to
start improving our cyber capabilities as well.

cyber threat

Whereas Article 5 mainly relies on deterring potential adversaries, [it
is important to understand the notion of deterrence in the cyber
field]{.underline}. In the conventional field, deterrence is pretty
straightforward: you just count the numbers of soldiers, rockets, tanks,
fighter jets etc. [In the cyber field this is more difficult; how do you
actively show what you are capable of, without giving away strengths and
weaknesses? That is why the]{.underline} three aforementioned [steps are
important: it makes **clear** NATO takes **cyber threats seriously** and
**will not hesitate to act**.]{.underline}

[Only when the Alliance collectively pursues an active cyber policy,
they will be able to successfully prepare themselves for cyber
threats]{.underline} to their national security. **[The idea of
collective self-defense will only survive as long as it proves to be
successful in defending its members against all]{.underline}** possible
**[threats. Cyber-attacks will be]{.underline}** among **[the biggest
challenges]{.underline}** of the next decades. Let us make sure we are
prepared.

Safety and security in the Netherlands

A safer world also means a safer Netherlands. Why? [Take]{.underline}
for instance **[terrorism]{.underline}**, **[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[cyberattacks]{.underline}**.
[These threats]{.underline} have one thing in common: they [don't stop
at borders]{.underline}.

So our own [safety and security]{.underline} often [starts
**abroad**]{.underline}. That's why [it's important to have **good
relations** with other countries]{.underline}. And [to protect stability
in the world]{.underline} together. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
works hard to do this. [NATO]{.underline} also [plays an **important
role**]{.underline}. But what exactly is NATO?

What is NATO?

NATO stands for 'North Atlantic Treaty Organization'. It is a military
alliance of 30 countries in Europe and North America. Its headquarters
is in Brussels. The Netherlands is a member of NATO. NATO was set up in
1949, not long after the end of the Second World War. Its aim: to
protect the security and freedom of all the countries that are members
(the Allies). And right now, that Alliance is perhaps more important
than ever.

Worldwide security challenges

[The world is a **less safe place** than before]{.underline}. Even in
areas near the Netherlands. [Take]{.underline} for instance the war in
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** started by President **[Putin. Or
China]{.underline}**: a growing global economic and military power that
is [flexing its muscles more and more often]{.underline}.
**[Technological developments]{.underline}** also [lead to **new
threats**]{.underline}, like cyberattacks. Or the use of **[modern
weapons]{.underline}**, like drones, that [can attack]{.underline}
targets [without humans having to risk their lives]{.underline}.

And [**climate change** can]{.underline} also [lead to **more
conflicts**, or **make conflicts worse**]{.underline}. [Countries need
each other so they can **prevent and combat**]{.underline} these
**[global threats]{.underline}**.

NATO and diplomacy

NATO is a defensive military alliance. You might think
[NATO]{.underline} is all about military action. But there
[is]{.underline} another [very important]{.underline} step that comes
first. [**NATO's main priority is diplomacy**. By talking]{.underline}
to each other and with other [countries]{.underline}, we try to **[solve
conflicts without using force]{.underline}**.

[Within NATO, the Allies work together]{.underline} and make agreements.
For instance on **[protecting democratic values]{.underline}**. Examples
are: [being able to hold **free and fair elections**]{.underline}, equal
rights for everyone, and freedom of expression.

Within NATO, military and non-military experts meet to exchange
information about what is happening in the world. In this way, [NATO
prepares itself for the challenges and threats of today and of the
future. With military and diplomatic action.]{.underline}

NATO in the world

[NATO]{.underline} also [helps]{.underline} other
[countries]{.underline} -- [that aren't members of NATO]{.underline} --
[with]{.underline} their [security]{.underline}. For instance by helping
them train their soldiers. [NATO soldiers can]{.underline} also be sent
to [deal with a **crisis**]{.underline}. This is important for the
Netherlands too. Because the world is becoming more and more closely
connected. And our safety and **[security is]{.underline}** also
**[connected]{.underline}** to that of other countries.

Introduction

[[**Article 5** of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}'s foundational 1949 North
Atlantic Treaty demands that if an "armed attack" is carried out against
even just one member state, all other member states "shall" consider
that attack (and any armed attack) on a member state "an attack against
them all" and "will assist," up to and "including the use of armed
force." This [**bedrock** [is the **centerpiece**
for]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}over seven decades of the **[[Pax
Americana]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [[the **U.S.-led global system** of
**military power**, **alliances**, **collective defense**, and ability
to project]{.underline}]{.mark} combined [[strength **anywhere** on the
planet. For it to continue]{.underline}]{.mark} in these roles, [[NATO
must]{.mark} adapt]{.underline} to current and future threats [by
**[add]{.mark}**ing **[cyberwar]{.mark}fare**]{.underline}---[[including
info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation [[war]{.mark}fare]{.underline}---**[[to
Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Cyberwarfare a Defining Part of Modern Warfare]{.underline}

Most cyberattacks against NATO states are carried out by Russia. A key
element of these involve what is called "information warfare" ("a new
face of war," quoting a RAND Corporation report), heavily involving
disinformation and that includes "warfare" to indicate these are hardly
benign/normal influence operations but those that have always been part
of any serious conventional war in modern times.

[The ever-evolving concept of [warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} in our
digital age, then, [**[does not have to include]{.underline}**]{.mark}
shots being fired from **[[guns]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [[it is
naïve to not consider **cyberwarfare as**]{.underline}]{.mark} simply
another form of [**[war]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the twenty-first
century that uses force in the digital realm to achieve results in some
of the same spirit as traditional armies: attack, defense, deception,
sabotage, destruction, and to pressure actors to change behavior.
[Clausewitz]{.underline} most famously wrote that "war is merely the
continuation of policy \[or politics\] by other means" and [would
have]{.underline} well [understood cyberwarfare to be war and well
within that "other means" category.]{.underline}

Russia and China are the two countries that have led in cyberwarfare.
Bolder but weaker Russia is NATO's---and America's---foremost enemy
(even if unofficially but obviously in a de facto sense), while China is
stronger but more reserved as the West's clearest top rival.
[China]{.underline} has [carried out]{.underline} and been a leader in
[non-weaponized hacking and espionage]{.underline} (admittedly common
among all major states), but has not, say, publicly released
disinformation or stolen information in a manner timed to seriously
interfere with NATO countries' elections (as Russia has). And though
China has its own complex influence operations,
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} undoubtedly [[has led]{.mark} by far [in
cyberattacks]{.mark} more hostile than espionage]{.underline} (uniquely
so among major powers) since its game-changing 2007 Estonia
cybercampaign.

**\[Figure Omitted\]**

Figure 1. Where the political warfare fits within the implements of
power. "All activities are illustrative, rather than an exhaustive list
of possible actors." From RAND\'s The Growing Need to Focus on Modern
Political Warfare

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} officially considers NATO a "threat," and
since that 2007 Estonia cybercampaign, [[has been]{.underline}]{.mark}
far more **[[aggressive and threatening]{.underline}]{.mark}** towards
NATO states, often [[stoking **internal divisions** and flooding them in
**cyberattacks**, including **election interference**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} boosting [**[secessionism]{.mark}**,
with]{.underline} notable [cybercampaigns being carried out against over
twenty NATO member states]{.underline} (apart from campaigns against
non-NATO states).

Furthermore, de facto, undeclared wars are the most common type of war
in modern history even if the term "war" is not used. America, for
example, has a long history of undeclared war going all the way back to
the nation's earliest days involving conflict with Native Americans and
also the 1798-1800 Quasi-War, then popularly termed "The Undeclared War
with France." As one scholar notes, "the legal state of war is possible
without actual fighting."

The Nature of Russian Cyberwarfare Confronting NATO

Thus, [it is hardly extreme to consider NATO and Russia in an undeclared
cyberwar]{.underline} and, therefore, a state of undeclared war. NATO
Review, NATO's flagship journal, even in 2017 published analysis noting
that Russia was waging "non-kinetic political war on the West," as I
have also maintained.

[[Russia's weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} in its undeclared war on NATO
are not tanks, bombs, bullets, or jets; rather, they [[are **illicit
financing**, **trolls**, **bots**, and **fake news**]{.mark}, with the
Kremlin often fomenting, funding, and [promoting]{.mark} the rise of
far-right **[ethno-nationalist extremists]{.mark}**, all while
disparaging those in the center and mainstream left]{.underline}.
Putin's party, the banally nationalist United Russia, has even formed
formal and informal alliances with significant like-minded political
parties in major NATO countries.

These [campaigns, relying on [**hacking**, **disinformation**,
**propaganda**, and **other cyber-methods**, are coordinated
through]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}major components of [the
[Russia]{.mark}n government]{.underline} and close Putin allies in and
out of the Kremlin, often using thousands of fake accounts to
artificially boost their impact, which, in turn, are bolstered within
the target states by agents and local allies along with unwitting true
believers long dubbed "useful idiots." [In]{.underline} many [NATO
countries]{.underline}---including the U.S.---[Putin is even liked by
far-rightists]{.underline}. Domestic media, then, can become loud voices
augmenting Russia's propaganda, especially right-wing media outlets, but
also some on the far-left. Repeated enough, [top]{.underline}
traditional [outlets latch onto this disinformation]{.underline},
sometimes mainstreaming it, other times critiquing yet still
propagating, as I have previously explained.

Reigning as the supreme disruptor on social media, Russia spews a
"firehose of falsehoods" that has been massively effective, distorting
and gaslighting public discussion to wildly amplify Russia's preferred
narratives beyond any natural organic reach, influencing many millions,
thus helping to create an atmosphere where disinformation is sometimes
consumed even more than actual news and doubt about even basic truths
becomes widespread.

And [[once]{.mark} Putin's favored are [in office]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}partly [because of Russian disinformation,
[they]{.mark}]{.underline} in turn further **[[spread Russian
disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the highest levels of their
governments, even mimicking Kremlin tactics and adopting policies
favorable to Russia, even covering up Russia's trail (both America's
2019 Mueller report and the British Parliament's Intelligence & Security
Committee's exceptional Russia report released last year note damning
examples of obstruction in their respective governments).

Most notably for NATO, the American presidential candidate Putin twice
ordered Russian election interference on behalf of had expressed
hostility to NATO repeatedly during the campaign, even contemplated
leaving the Alliance as president, and may still have done so if
reelected.

Cyberwarfare a Larger Threat Now to NATO than Terrorism

By far, the most damaging, destabilizing, and effective attacks NATO
countries since 9/11 have been Russian cyberattacks, campaigns that have
been able to affect political outcomes and internal dynamics in numerous
NATO countries to suit Putin's agenda.

[[Russian cyberwarfare efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} against the U.S.
have [[included **election
interference**]{.underline}]{.mark}---beginning with what I called back
in December 2016 the First Russo-American Cyberwar---that has already
**[[caused damage to America]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its
**[[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[**reputation** that is **hard to exaggerate**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[with effects]{.underline}]{.mark} not only still being felt by the
U.S. but [**[guaranteed to]{.underline}**]{.mark} still **[[be felt for
some time]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Russia is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
clearly and **[[repeatedly promoting unrest and
division]{.underline}]{.mark}**, recently [[pushing]{.underline}]{.mark}
both [[disinformation about]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**coronavirus**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} bogus conspiracy [[theories of
**fraud**]{.underline}]{.mark} 2020 U.S. presidential election. In the
run-up to that election, the Russians targeted the main political rival
of their preferred incumbent, just as in 2016.

[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} efforts produced
[[results]{.underline}]{.mark}: multiple respectable surveys and any
casual look at social media show that vast numbers of Americans---even
key leaders---are supporting this disinformation, even spreading
nonsense about both the 2020 presidential election, [**[damaging faith
in]{.underline}**]{.mark} the very foundations of
[**[democracy]{.underline}**]{.mark} coronavirus (including millions
doubting coronavirus vaccines, literally helping kill Americans).
[[There are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[**global effects** on opinion of
**America**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the rest of the West along with
international views on coronavirus and vaccines.

Most recently coming to light are the devastatingly far-reaching
SolarWinds operation; a cyberattack against USAID that ensnared some 150
government agencies, non-profits, think tanks, and human rights groups
globally that have criticized Russia; a recent attack on top U.S.
cybersecurity firm FireEye; and the Colonial Pipeline and JBS meat plant
ransomware attacks, with Russia playing a role with these ransomware
groups similar to how the Taliban gave al-Qaeda safe harbor, resulting
in the 9/11 attacks---incidentally, the only time NATO ever invoked
Article 5.

In contrast, physical terrorist attacks in NATO countries since 9/11,
while tragic, have still had comparatively limited effects. Even
Russia's own 2018 Novichok chemical weapon attack on British soil in
Salisbury against Russian military intelligence officer turned spy for
the UK Sergei Skripal had more symbolic an effect than anything else,
dwarfed by the damage from Russian efforts to move the 2016 Brexit vote
in the direction of Leave or the effect of Russia's campaign to amplify
Scottish secessionism (now increasingly likely and sooner rather than
later, an outcome that would obviously dismember and damage a UK already
acutely damaged by Brexit). To quote journalist George Packer,
"antisocial media has us all in its grip."

Falling Short

NATO currently has a Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE) in Tallinn, Estonia. Yet even presently, one-sixth of NATO---
Albania, Canada, Iceland, Luxembourg, and North Macedonia---are not
members of this Centre, though, encouragingly, Canada and Luxembourg are
going to join, new states were recently added, and non-NATO states
Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland are "Contributing
Participants," a status available to those outside of NATO; Australia,
Ireland, Japan, South Korea, and---most recently---Ukraine will join
that second group. There is also set to be a new military cyberdefense
command center fully operational in 2023 at NATO's military base in
Belgium.

[[NATO considers "cyber]{.mark} defence...part of NATO's]{.underline}
core task of [collective defence]{.underline}" and has since 2014, when
the Alliance first specifically articulated the possibility of invoking
Article 5 in reaction to cyberattacks (but only "on a case-by-case
basis"). NATO has since "pledge\[d\] to ensure the Alliance keeps pace
with the fast evolving cyber threat landscape and that our nations will
be capable of defending themselves in cyberspace as in the air, on land
and at sea," repeatedly reiterating that Article 5 being invoked in
response to a cyberattack is a possibility, including just this
September 2020 and in June 2021.

[**[Yet]{.underline}**]{.mark} official working papers, conferences,
interviews, [[statements]{.underline}]{.mark}, and raising possibilities
[[are **no substitute for** ]{.mark}**a concrete, [clear
policy]{.mark}**[, and NATO]{.mark} simply [does not have
this.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} vague [[idea seems to be]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[if a cyberattack was "serious"]{.underline}]{.mark} enough,
[[Article 5 could be activated]{.underline}]{.mark}, but **[[this seems
myopic]{.underline}]{.mark}**: **[[death by a thousand cuts is still
death]{.underline}]{.mark}** and has [the same]{.underline} effect [as
decapitation, so [tolerating many smaller attacks]{.mark}, thereby
[transmit]{.mark}ting [a clear indication that there will **not be a
collective Article 5 response**]{.mark} to them, is]{.underline} just
**[bad policy]{.underline}**. It is also most decidedly not the case for
armed attacks, in which any by a nation-state or sponsored by one would
trigger Article 5. [[Years of unrelenting cyberwar]{.mark}fare [has done
**more damage to NATO than any Soviet Army**]{.mark} did during the Cold
War, in part, **[because of Article 5]{.mark}**]{.underline}: the USSR
and then **[[Russia did not dare use armed force]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to strike any NATO country [[for fear of Article 5]{.mark}'s unequivocal
guarantee of a collective response]{.underline}, even in 2015 when
NATO-member Turkey shot down a Russian military jet over Syria.

[[Yet when it comes to cyber]{.mark}warfare]{.underline}, [**[NATO
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} practically [**[inviting Russia to
attack]{.underline}**]{.mark} and get away with it,
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the Alliance quite consistently
demonstrating an unwillingness, even [[**inability** under its existing
framework to **collectively respond to Russia's
cyberaggression**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the aforementioned UK Russia
report noted, "[[Russia is not]{.mark} overly [concerned about]{.mark}
individual [reprisal" against]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}its
aggressive acts, including its [[cyberattacks, with]{.underline}]{.mark}
even [**[the U.S.]{.mark} demonstrably [inspiring little
hesitation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Clearly, [pretending cyberwarfare is not war and allowing
[cyberwarfare]{.mark} in real-world practice to be kept [out of]{.mark}
NATO's [Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[leaving
individual]{.underline}]{.mark} members [[states flailing
independently]{.underline}]{.mark} and ineffectively against an
organized, determined, and capable de facto enemy content to stand down
its conventional military against NATO [[while unleashing]{.mark} its
[cyberunits]{.mark} upon it [with impunity]{.mark}]{.underline}---has
**[[failed]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

At the end of New York Times cybersecurity reporter Nicole Perlroth's
recent book This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends---the indispensable,
terrifying, definitive account of the development of cyberwarfare and
the mess in which we currently find ourselves---the author warns that
"[many will say]{.underline}" that "these...critical assignments of our
time" [to deter and defend ourselves from cyberwarfare "are impossible,
but we have summoned the best of our scientific community, government,
industry, and everyday people to overcome existential challenges before.
Why can't we do it again?...]{.underline}We don't have to wait until the
Big One to get going."

As a main advantage of the West over Russia is that people like the West
a lot more than Russia---materializing in close economic, diplomatic,
and military ties Russia can only dream of---**[[the easiest
way]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the West [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} face
and [[fight this]{.underline}]{.mark} dire and metastasizing
[[cyberthreat from Russia is by **leveraging its**
]{.mark}**alliances**, and, most of all, this means involving
**[NATO]{.mark}** and doing so in a big way.]{.underline}

As there is no statute of limitations on cyberattacks and the
just-proposed framework not precluded by the current NATO treaty, [NATO
would]{.underline} even [be in its full rights]{.underline} (and is
overdue) [to now invoke Article 5 against Russia for its
cyberwarfare]{.underline} so that this cyberwarfare will result in far
more pain for Russia than any damage it inflicts.

How to [**[Revise Article 5 and]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
[**[NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark} Treaty Overall

[[With Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} rampant
[[cyberwar]{.mark}fare]{.underline} only [[**intensifying** and
its]{.underline}]{.mark} obvious [[pattern as a **hostile bad-faith
actor**, it is]{.mark} absolutely [**necessary** for a **paradigm
shift** in]{.mark} the international system for **[deterring
cyberattacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Because [[NATO is the
premier]{.mark} Western defensive [alliance, **crystalizing
cyberwarfare's relationship to Article 5 is a must**, the only way for
**NATO to maintain credible collective defense**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the twenty-first century.

To this end, "or [[cyberattack]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[must be
added]{.mark} after]{.underline} every occurrence of the words "[armed
attack]{.underline}" [[in Article]{.underline}]{.mark} 5 (e.g., "The
Parties agree that an armed attack or cyberattack against one or more of
them...").

In a longform, earlier version of this proposal, I have proposed a new
detailed Article 15 that defines cyberwarfare in the Article 5 context
and who/what would be covered. [[Any attacks that cause]{.mark} damage
and [harm would be included, as would]{.mark}]{.underline} digital
information warfare/[[disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} campaigns. Yet
fairly standard [espionage]{.underline} operations [will
not]{.underline} be included (say, China's hacking) [unless]{.underline}
either [the scale is so exceptional]{.underline} (as was the case with
Russia's unprecedented SolarWinds hack) [or if what is hacked is
weaponized]{.underline} or threats to weaponize that information are
made.

By "weaponized," I mean any action that tries to coerce, influence, or
target publicly. Targets that would trigger Article 5 include all NATO
citizens, residents, or entities---public sector or private---or anyone
operating on NATO member state territory, as NATO cannot tolerate its
territory being used for any such attack. Any attacks targeting family,
friends, or connections of these folks for the same purposes would also
be covered. This would apply to all state or state-sponsored
cyberattacks, while terrorist or non-state actors would also be covered
under certain actions but other activities would default to being
handled by normal counterterrorism and/or law enforcement agencies.

[Conclusion]{.underline}

**[[Expanding Article 5 is necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}** and overdue.
[The]{.underline} early [twenty-first century's second decade has been
something of a Wild West, with Russia using the lawlessness of the cyber
domain to its devastating effect]{.underline}. [The time for lawlessness
is over, and [revising]{.mark} NATO's [Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}as suggested herein will not only clarify the rules for NATO
enemies and rivals, but also for the members of a NATO Alliance itself
that is in desperate need of clarity and strength on this issue. It
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[make NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} once
again [[an alliance that **instills fear in** ]{.mark}**the minds of
[Russia]{.mark}n leaders**]{.underline} (as it did with Stalin and
subsequent Soviet leadership) [[who would engage in **reckless**
]{.mark}**acts of [aggression]{.mark}** []{.mark}against NATO or its
states, even if "just" through cyberwarfare.]{.underline}

#### The plan is key to [NATO credibility]{.underline} and [defense]{.underline}\-\--the alliance must [adapt]{.underline} to the [changing mode of war]{.underline}.

SILVER SPRING---[Alliances between nations must **adapt to retain
power**]{.underline} over time, [and in no area has warfare evolved more
in recent years than in cyberwarfare]{.underline}. **[Article
5]{.underline}** of NATO's founding 1949 North Atlantic Treaty
[mandates]{.underline} that [if an "armed attack" is carried out against
a member state, all member states]{.underline} (currently thirty,
including the most powerful Western nations) "shall" consider that
attack and any armed attack on even just one member state "an attack
against them all" and "[will assist]{.underline}" it, up to and
"including the use of armed force." [As the **centerpiece**]{.underline}
for over seventy years **[of]{.underline}** the West's **[Pax
Americana]{.underline}**, [global military power, system of **alliances
and collective defense**, and ability to project combined strength
anywhere on the planet, **NATO must adapt to the present by adding
cyberwarfare**]{.underline}---**[including information
warfare]{.underline}**---**[to Article 5.]{.underline}**

Cyberwarfare As Modern Warfare

[An obvious point in favor of including cyberwarfare in Article 5 is
that, by far, the most effective, damaging, and destabilizing attacks
against NATO]{.underline} countries since 9/11 **[have been
cyberattacks]{.underline}**, most carried out by Russia. The term
"[information warfare]{.underline}" ("a new face of war," quoting a RAND
Corporation report) [refers to a key element of this cyberwarfare and
includes the word warfare to indicate these are **hardly benign, normal
influence operations**]{.underline} and are, indeed, the types of
operations that have always been part of any serious conventional war in
modern times. Even in the nineteenth-century, von Clausewitz wrote that
"War is...an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will."

[The ever-evolving concept of warfare in our digital age]{.underline},
then, [does not have to include shots]{.underline} being fired from
guns, [and it is **naïve** to not consider cyberwarfare as simply
**another form of war**]{.underline} in the twenty-first century that
uses force in the digital realm to achieve results in some of the same
spirit as traditional armies: attack, defense, deception, sabotage,
destruction, and to pressure actors to change behavior. Clausewitz most
famously wrote that "war is merely the continuation of policy \[or
politics\] by other means" and would have well understood cyberwarfare
(sometimes just termed cyberwar) to be war and well within that "other
means" category.

The two countries that have led in cyberwarfare are Russia and China,
the first (and weaker, but bolder) being NATO's (and America's) clearest
top state enemy (even if unofficially but clearly in a de facto sense),
the second (and stronger, more reserved) being America's clearest top
state rival in a holistic sense, as China has engaged and led in much
non-weaponized hacking and espionage (admittedly common among major
powers), but has not, say, brazenly released stolen information or
disinformation in a way timed to significantly interfere with NATO
member states' elections (as Russia has). And though China has its own
sophisticated influence operations, Russia undisputedly has led by far
in acts more hostile than espionage (uniquely so among major powers)
since its watershed 2007 Estonia cybercampaign (such campaigns might
better be termed cyberassaults than cyberattacks, the latter a broader,
far more common term which can even apply to a single high school
student's cyberattacks against his own school district).

[Russia]{.underline} officially views NATO as a "threat," and since that
2007 Estonia cybercampaign, [has become far more aggressive and
threatening towards NATO]{.underline}, often **[playing with internal
NATO nationalisms and blanketing NATO nations in
cyberattacks]{.underline}**, [including **election interference
and**]{.underline} bolstering of **[secessionist
campaigns]{.underline}**, [with notable cybercampaigns being carried out
against **over twenty NATO member states**]{.underline} (leaving aside
its campaigns waged against non-NATO states).

**\[FIGURE OMITTED\]**

Furthermore, de facto, non-declared wars are the most common type of war
in the modern era even if the term "war" is not specifically used.
America, for example, has a long history of undeclared war going all the
way back to the Articles of Confederation and the early days of the
Washington Administration involving conflict with Native Americans and
also the John Adams Administration's 1798-1800 Quasi-War, then popularly
termed "The Undeclared War with France." Furthermore, as one scholar
notes, "the legal state of war is possible without actual fighting."

Taking all this into account, then, [it is hardly unreasonable to
consider Russia and NATO in a state of undeclared
cyberwarfare]{.underline} and, therefore, a state of undeclared war. One
of NATO's flagship publications, NATO Review, even published analysis in
2017 acknowledging that Russia was waging "non-kinetic political war on
the West."

In fact, as I have argued for some time, [a]{.underline} truly [deep
look would expose Putin]{.underline} and his Kremlin [conducting a clear
de facto war to **destroy NATO, the West, the EU, and Western
democracy**]{.underline}; [**to fracture trans-Atlantic and European
unity** and even the unity of individual Western nations; and
to]{.underline} foment, fund, and **[favor the rise of far-right
ethno-nationalists and secessionists friendly to Russia and hostile to
the U.S. and NATO]{.underline}** in NATO countries and elsewhere, all
while savaging those in the center and mainstream left not preferred by
Putin. [The parties Putin helps usually have much in common
with]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin's]{.underline}
banally [nationalist United Russia party]{.underline}, which has struck
up mixes of formal and informal alliances with several significant
European political parties in major NATO states.

Though there have been military moves by Russia in Ukraine and
Georgia---two NATO aspirants---[the main weapons in its undeclared war
on NATO are **not tanks, bombs, or jets**; rather, they are **bots,
trolls, and fake news**.]{.underline}

#### [Certainty]{.underline} and [severity]{.underline} are key\-\--lack of threshold [invites Russian cyberwar]{.underline} and [erodes Article 5]{.underline}.

Falling Short

[Official working papers, conferences, interviews, statements, and
raising possibilities]{.underline} on the subject [are one thing, but a
**concrete, clear policy is another**]{.underline}, and **[NATO has
nothing of the sort]{.underline}**.

[The vague idea seems to be that if a cyberattack was "serious" enough,
Article 5 would be invoked]{.underline}, but **[there is no definition
of]{.underline}** what this **[threshold]{.underline}** would be,
[and]{.underline}, frankly, [this idea seems rather
**myopic**]{.underline}: **[death by a thousand cuts is still death and
has the same effect as decapitation]{.underline}**, so [tolerating many
smaller attacks and sending a **clear signal that there will not be a
collective Article 5 response to them is simply bad
policy**.]{.underline}

Consider, too, that [Russia would never be able to get away with flying
over NATO skies and dropping leaflets of hostile
disinformation]{.underline} by the millions onto NATO populations. [It
could never get away with doing so once or once in a while, let alone
consistently and during sensitive times]{.underline} of pivotal
political decisions or unrest in the targeted countries, **[and yet this
is exactly the cyber-equivalent]{.underline}** of what Russia is getting
away with against NATO's most significant member states and many of its
smaller ones, too. And [while Russia sending in Spetsnaz special forces
to steal sensitive information from U.S. bases in Alaska or use physical
weapons to sabotage or destroy government computer systems in Lithuania
would be viewed automatically as an Article 5-triggering act of war, the
same results over and over again from several years of unrelenting
cyberwarfare are not]{.underline}, even though this has done more damage
to NATO than any Soviet Army did throughout the decades-long Cold War.
This is, in part, because of NATO: the USSR and then Russia did not dare
use armed force to attack any NATO state for fear of that explicitly
guaranteed Article 5 collective response (even when NATO-member Turkey
shot down a Russian military jet over Syria in 2015).

Yet [when it comes to cyberwarfare, NATO is practically **inviting
Russia to attack and get away with it**, with the Alliance quite
consistently **demonstrating its**]{.underline} inability and
**[unwillingness]{.underline}** under its current framework **[to
respond collectively to Russian cyberaggression]{.underline}**. As noted
in the aforementioned UK Russia report, ["Russia is not overly concerned
about individual reprisal" against]{.underline} its aggressive acts,
most certainly including its [cyberattacks, with]{.underline} even
[**the U.S. clearly inspiring no fear**.]{.underline}

Language can often be tricky, and terms like "war" should never be
thrown about lightly. But with the advent of the internet and the
realities of the modern world, [NATO cannot become complacent with
preventing traditional warfare while **failing to adapt to
cyberwarfare**]{.underline}. [Pretending cyberwarfare is not war and
allowing cyberwarfare in real-world practice to be kept out of NATO's
Article 5]{.underline}---leaving individual members states flailing
independently and ineffectively against a determined, capable, and
organized de facto enemy content to stand down its conventional forces
against NATO while unleashing its cyberunits upon it with
impunity---**[has not discouraged Russian cyberwarfare against NATO, it
has encouraged it.]{.underline}** [Article 5 makes no exception for
smaller armed attacks, and any serious collective cybersecurity defense
should **make no exception for smaller cyberattacks**.]{.underline}

#### The [US]{.underline} must act through [Article 5]{.underline}\-\--its key to [credibility]{.underline}.

[How to **Revise Article 5**]{.underline} and the NATO Treaty Overall

Considering that the West's main advantage over Russia is that people
like the West a lot more than Russia---manifesting itself in close
diplomatic, military, and economic ties about which Russia can only
fantasize---[the easiest way for the West to face and counter this dire
and worsening cyberthreat from Russia is by **leveraging its
alliances**, and]{.underline}, more than anything else, [this means
**involving NATO and involving it in a big way**]{.underline}.

U.S. President Joe [Biden]{.underline} himself [penned a
recent]{.underline} Washington Post [op-ed]{.underline} in advance of
his upcoming trip to Europe for a NATO summit and [to]{.underline}
confront Putin face-to-face, writing: "In Brussels, at the NATO summit,
I will [affirm the United States' **unwavering commitment to Article 5**
and to **ensuring our alliance is strong** in the face of]{.underline}
every challenge, including threats like **[cyberattacks]{.underline}**
on our critical infrastructure."

[He can do that by **proposing to strengthen Article 5
itself**.]{.underline}

With Russia's rampant cyberwarfare only intensifying and its clear
pattern as a bad-faith hostile actor, [a paradigm shift in the
international system for deterring cyberattacks is **absolutely
necessary**]{.underline}. [Since NATO is the premier defensive alliance
of the West, **formalizing cyberwarfare's relationship to Article 5 is a
necessary leap**]{.underline} forward on this much-needed path [and the
**only way forward for NATO to maintain credible collective defense** as
the twenty-first century progresses.]{.underline}

To this end, "or **[cyberattack]{.underline}**" **[must be
added]{.underline}** after each instance of the words "armed attack"
**[in Article 5]{.underline}** (e.g., "The Parties agree that an armed
attack or cyberattack against one or more of them..." \[emphasis
added\]).

Conclusion: **[Expanding Article 5 Is Necessary]{.underline}** and
Overdue

[The early twenty-first century's second decade has been something of a
Wild West, with Russia emerging as the biggest beneficiary in terms of
cyberwarfare as defined above]{.underline}. While China has also
benefitted in terms of massive espionage and acquisition of Western
intellectual property, it is Russia that has used the lawlessness of the
cyber domain from a collective security standpoint to engage in the most
egregious acts (most recently and most notably with the unprecedented
SolarWinds) and ransomware attacks), acts that could easily be defined
as hostile acts of war.

[The time for **lawlessness is over**]{.underline}, and, with no statute
of limitations on cyberattacks and the just-proposed framework not
precluded by the current NATO treaty, NATO would be in its full rights
(and is overdue) to invoke Article 5 against Russia now for its
cyberwarfare so that Russia's cyberwarfare will cause Russia far more
pain than any damage it inflicts.

This has not been the case, but it must be.

[Revising NATO's Article 5]{.underline} as suggested herein (leaving
aside invocation) [will not only clarify the rules for NATO enemies and
rivals, but also for the members of a NATO Alliance]{.underline} itself
that is in desperate need of clarity and strength on this issue. [It
will also make NATO once again an alliance that **instills fear in the
minds of Russian leaders**]{.underline} (as it did with Stalin and
subsequent Soviet leadership) who would engage in reckless acts of
aggression against NATO or its states, even if "just" through
cyberwarfare.

[Member states recognizing that they are in a state of
war]{.underline}---cyberwar, but still war---[with Russia]{.underline}
and unambiguously making cyberwarfare a key plank of the Alliance's main
collective defense mechanism **[is essential]{.underline}**, then, **[to
keeping NATO the force for deterring aggression]{.underline}** it has
been for many decades.

**[Projecting such strength]{.underline}**, both on paper and in
practice, **[will serve as a real-world check against further Russian
cyberattacks]{.underline}** when **[inaction and lack of clarity has
not]{.underline}**, [enhancing the security of every NATO member state
and perhaps even]{.underline} eventually [forcing Russia to a point
where **productive engagement, not adventuristic brinksmanship, is its
chosen priority**]{.underline}.

attacks** at higher levels of confidence]{.underline}. **[Forensic tools
have improved]{.underline}**, and private and [state analysts have built
up **databases and characteristic patterns**]{.underline} for known
intruders. [On a technical level, truly harmful cyber attacks are very
complicated]{.underline} and involve many moving pieces. Thus, [the more
complicated the cyber attack, the more likely the attacker is to commit
mistakes along the way, **enabling**]{.underline} a **[forensics expert
to trace the origin]{.underline}** of the attack (Lindsay, 2015).
Indeed, [governments within the Alliance and beyond are **increasingly
attributing malicious cyber incidents** to states and their proxies.
Such transparency on cyber incidents is increasingly collective,
coordinated in policy and time, and independent of the scale, nature, or
impact of the incident]{.underline} (Giles and Hartmann, 2019). The
Rapporteur supports this emerging policy of naming and shaming
perpetrators and encourages further conversations at the NATO level.

16\. [Even if states and their proxies could be confident they will
remain anonymous, truly convincing strategic rationales for large-scale
surprise attacks are lacking. Anonymous cyber attacks are not
well-suited for coercion]{.underline}, for example. Coercion only works
if the attacked entity knows whom to yield or make concessions to. As
one analyst points out succinctly, "\[p\]urely anonymous coercion is
almost impossible because communicating and understanding the power to
hurt implies that there is someone doing the hurting and a target
concerned about avoiding getting hurt" (Lindsay, 2015). As a result,
**[if an opponent wishes to coerce through cyber attacks, he cannot hide
himself]{.underline}**. This would defeat the purpose. How can the
victim give in to demands if it does not know who the attacker is? (In
contrast, cyber criminals want to stay anonymous when, for example, they
attempt to extort money from victims.)

[Since World War II]{.underline}, however, [U.S. leaders
have]{.underline} reversed course and [signed defense pacts with more
than 60 countries]{.underline}. As a result, the United States is
legally obligated to defend a patchwork of nations that spans five
continents, contains 25 percent of the earth's population, and accounts
for nearly 75 percent of global economic output. [To what extent does
this massive **commitment entangle the United States in
wars**]{.underline} it would otherwise avoid?

This is a pivotal question for U.S. foreign policy --- and one that
increasingly divides U.S. policymakers from many of the nation's most
prominent international relations scholars.

U.S. political leaders almost uniformly support allied engagement, and
President Barack Obama recently reaffirmed U.S. commitments to defend
allies during crises between North and South Korea, Iran and Israel,
Russia and Ukraine, and China on the one hand and Japan and the
Philippines on the other.

A growing number of scholars, however, argue that such commitments are
dangerous and should be abandoned. According to these scholars,
America's alliances are not assets but rather "transmission belts for
war" that "risk roping the United States into conflicts over
strategically marginal territory." Several scholars even compare the
U.S. alliance network to the tangled web of European security
commitments that helped catalyze World War I. To avoid getting sucked
into foreign wars, these scholars argue, the United States should scale
back its alliance network or scrap it altogether --- measures that, if
implemented, would constitute the biggest shift in U.S. grand strategy
in two generations.

[Are]{.underline} these [fears of entangling alliances
warranted]{.underline}? To find out, **[I analyzed every U.S. military
conflict since 1948]{.underline}** ([the year the United States signed
its first peacetime alliance]{.underline}) [and asked]{.underline} a
basic question: [To what extent was U.S. involvement driven by formal
alliance commitments?]{.underline}

[The results]{.underline}, which are published in an article in
International Security, are surprising: U.S. entanglement almost never
happens. [Over a 65-year period in which the United States had more than
60 formal allies, there have been **only five ostensible episodes of
U.S. entanglement**]{.underline} --- the 1954 and 1995/96 Taiwan Strait
Crises; the Vietnam War; and the interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo in
the 1990s --- [and even these cases are **far from clear-cut**. In
each]{.underline} case [there were **other**]{.underline} important
[**drivers of U.S. involvement**, U.S. policymakers carefully limited
support for allies, allies restrained the United States from escalating
its involvement, the United States deterred adversaries and allies from
escalating the conflict, or all of the above.]{.underline}

[Against]{.underline} this [limited evidence of entanglement, I find
many cases in which **alliances restrained the United
States**]{.underline}, or in which the United States restrained its
allies or sidestepped costly commitments. I only examine U.S. military
conflicts and therefore cannot evaluate fully the prevalence of such
cases of peace, but even within my biased sample, there are at least
four cases in which alliances prevented U.S. escalation, and another
seven cases in which the United States reneged on security commitments
and/or restrained an ally from attacking a third party.

Of course, the United States has fought alongside allies on numerous
occasions. But in most cases, U.S. actions were driven by an alignment
of interests between the United States and its allies, not by alliance
obligations. In fact, in many cases, U.S. policymakers were the main
advocates of military intervention and cajoled reluctant allies to join
the fight.

At worst, therefore, alliances have had a mixed effect on U.S.
involvement in military conflicts --- some alliances at times have
encouraged U.S. military involvement, others have discouraged it, and
some have simply been ignored by U.S. policymakers. The risk of
entanglement is not trivial, but historically, U.S. policymakers have
managed this risk by inserting loopholes into alliance agreements,
shirking costly commitments, maintaining a diversified alliance
portfolio that generates offsetting demands from different allies, and
using explicit alliance commitments to deter adversaries and restrain
allies from initiating or escalating conflicts.

Ultimately, this indicates that [allied engagement does not preclude,
and may even facilitate, U.S. **military restraint**]{.underline}. [When
the United States has overreached militarily, the main cause has not
been entangling alliances but]{.underline} rather what Richard Betts
calls "**[self-entrapment]{.underline}**" --- the tendency of U.S.
leaders to define national interests expansively, to exaggerate the
magnitude of foreign threats, and to underestimate the costs of military
intervention.

**[Scrapping alliances will not correct these bad habits]{.underline}**.
In fact, **[disengaging]{.underline}** from alliances
**[may]{.underline}** simply **[unshackle the United States and enable
it to intervene recklessly abroad]{.underline}** while leaving it
without partners to share the burden when those interventions go awry.

Allied Assurance: Key Concepts and Current Challenges for U.S. Policy".
https://www.usafa.edu/app/uploads/OCP69.pdf

From the end of the Second World War to the present day, many **[U.S.
allies have generally (if sometimes reluctantly) accepted U.S.
leadership in regard to alliance policymaking and
strategizing]{.underline}**. This reflects the fact that [the United
States represents the **strongest member within a defense
pact**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [many U.S. allies believe their
defense requirements exceed what they can independently develop or
afford; they **depend on their alliance with the United
States**]{.underline} to meet their remaining needs. As a result, [many
U.S. allies rely on U.S. extended deterrence and assurance strategies to
guarantee their national defense.]{.underline} Over time, these U.S.
strategies -- and the forces associated with them, particularly if
deployed on an ally's home territory -- often become part of an ally's
long-term foreign policy and defense planning.

As a result, once the general strategy for its assurance, and the
extension of deterrence to its key adversaries, is established between
the United States and a foreign ally, the latter often proves resistant
to any significant change to either. Allied objections stem from
concerns that any changes imply an alteration in the U.S. political
resolve or military capabilities that are critical for their defense
against foreign adversaries. Many allies are well aware, for example,
that foreign deployments are frequently a target on Capitol Hill; both
during the Cold War and afterward, Senators reviewing the U.S. defense
budget have perennially pressed for allies to shoulder a greater share
of the burden for their defense. In addition, although conflicts and
contingencies have occasionally raised the number of U.S. troops posted
overseas, in general over the past 20 years the United States has slowly
but perceptibly reduced the numbers of forces permanently stationed
abroad.

As a result, any change to U.S. strategies, regardless of how these
changes are depicted, may lead allies to question whether their status
has somehow changed within the eyes of U.S. leaders. Allies may wonder
if their defense concerns are still important to Washington; if they are
surprised or unprepared by a shift in U.S. policy or strategy, they may
conclude their views on these changes were not considered or deemed
important. Changes in the U.S. military capabilities deployed in-country
or in-theater may also raise issues for allies, as many are unable to
replace these forces using resources available to their own militaries.

In addition, allies resist change because many have an acute sense that
U.S. extended deterrence and assurance strategies operate within a
complex network of political relationships at the domestic, regional,
and international levels -- and as a result, any changes to these
strategies can cascade throughout the entire system, often with negative
impacts for their own country (or political regime, in cases where these
strategies touch on sensitive local issues). They prefer maintenance of
the status quo over changes that may give rise to some uncertainty --
whether in their own country, in the minds of adversaries, or both --
regarding whether the United States remains a reliable and predictable
security partner.

Most **[U.S. allies]{.underline}**, however, also **[regard the United
States as critical to the deterrence of significant or existential
threats to their national security]{.underline}**. As discussed in the
historical survey above, [they will debate but **rarely flatly oppose
U.S. proposals to change extended deterrence or assurance
strategies**]{.underline}. Significantly, [withdrawals from defense
partnerships or alliances featuring the United States are
**rare**]{.underline} -- and even when they occur, the states involved
often seek to retain some kind of defense relationship with Washington.
As a result, **[allied resistance to alterations]{.underline}** in
extended deterrence and assurance strategies **[does not make change
impossible]{.underline}**, but does underline the importance of close
communication and consultation between Washington and allied capitals in
advance of altering or amending these strategies. Viewed over the time
period discussed in Part 3, their interest in maintaining the status quo
represents a phenomenon that was sometimes overlooked within the U.S.
strategic community -- despite dramatic geopolitical change, to include
superpower détente, the end of the Cold War, and 9/11. Many longtime
U.S. allies remained continually reliant on their partnership with the
United States to shield them from current enemies, prospective threats,
regional instability, and shocks to the geopolitical system.

President-Elect Joe [Biden's]{.underline} transition [team has declared
cyber threats as "one of the defining challenges of our
time."]{.underline} In its early days, the incoming US administration
must take on cybersecurity threats as one of its key priorities.
[Nowhere will that effort be more important than with the United States'
closest Allies at **NATO**]{.underline}, a cornerstone for Western
security. Today, **[NATO's security is threatened]{.underline}** by
Russia's and China's continuous cyberattacks on the Alliance and its
members. To accomplish its mission of deterrence and defense, [NATO
needs to implement a strategy of **proactive, continuous
responses**]{.underline} to China and Russia in cyberspace, where great
power competition is playing out in real time.

Russia and China challenge NATO and its members in cyberspace on a daily
basis, as part of ongoing hybrid campaigns to undermine the
transatlantic community. The Kremlin's actions have involved intrusions
into Allies' critical infrastructures, manipulating Allies' elections
through hacks and disinformation, and even blocking GPS information
critical to NATO activities. The Chinese government has engaged in cyber
espionage against Allies' military capabilities; intellectual property
theft related to sensitive technologies, industries, and infrastructure;
and disinformation against transatlantic countries, including around the
coronavirus. These efforts to weaken NATO countries and Alliance
cohesion represent a persistent threat to Allied security.

NATO has recognized the collective dangers of these hybrid attacks in
cyberspace. Up to this point, however, the Alliance has taken a reactive
approach, responding as if Russian and Chinese cyber attacks are each
isolated incidents. But because Russian and Chinese cyber efforts are
part of continuous campaigns directed at the overall capability of the
Alliance, NATO's response has been insufficient, failing to reduce or
dissuade further attacks. To assure the security of its members going
forward, NATO needs its own continuous response campaign to these
threats.

President-elect [Biden]{.underline} and his team have [pledged to renew
US leadership in cooperation with Allies]{.underline} and partners.
**[That agenda should start at NATO, and a key focus should be on
cybersecurity]{.underline}**. In early NATO meetings, the
**[Biden]{.underline}** administration **[should champion a
cybersecurity]{.underline}** continuous-**[response
campaign]{.underline}**, built around three key actions.

Ukraine conflict\". No Publication. 2-24-2022.

Following the shortcomings of the 2015 United Nations Group of
Governmental Experts report on information and telecommunications in the
context of national security, a lack of consensus continues to exist on
the severity of cyberspace operations targeting critical infrastructure
requiring collective and even national responses. Individual nations
constructed individual criteria and response actions, utilising
diplomacy, information, military, or economic action. They largely did
so alone or in combination with other states. [NATO]{.underline},
however, [did not formulate a coherent]{.underline} analogous
[response]{.underline} [and]{.underline} as a result, [**lacks publicly
acknowledged policy addressing cyberspace activities** that would
constitute a necessary collective response under **Article 5**. In order
for **NATO to maintain its relevance** in the present moment and sustain
it through the coming years, **this paradigm must change**.]{.underline}

[NATO must adjust its thinking regarding methods of warfare as
cyberspace operations]{.underline}---both destructive attacks and
disinformation---[continue to grow]{.underline} in complexity and in
certain areas even replace traditional kinetic operations. To fulfill
this role in kinetic as well as non-kinetic realms, [NATO must be
prepared for hybrid]{.underline} forms of [warfare]{.underline} and
present slated to join the alliance a cohesive and tailored response to
transgressions. [This is increasingly important as Russia continues to
threaten potential future NATO members]{.underline} such as Finland and
Sweden, who are slated to join the alliance in the coming months. Russia
has overtly stated that the invasion of Ukraine was, in part, a response
to NATO's eastward expansion. Although Russia has deemed NATO expansion
into former Soviet states to be problematic since the collapse of the
USSR, recently, Moscow has also begun to denounce potential expansion
beyond its perceived immediate sphere of influence. For example, on
April 14, 2022, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov
cautioned that the inclusion of Finland and Sweden into the military
alliance would have dire consequences, including Russia reinforcing
nuclear weapons in the Baltic Sea region.

Considering the increased emphasis and relevance of the transatlantic
alliance leading up to and during Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [it is
imperative for the organisation's member states to identify and agree
upon **more pronounced "triggers" or "red lines"** that determine **what
constitutes a sufficiently egregious action in cyberspace for Article
5** to be discussed]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} if need be,
potentially **[invoked]{.underline}**. Furthermore, in enhancing its
preparedness in cyberspace, specific policies must be crafted that
delineate synchronised actions taken collectively by members to prevent
Russian malign activities in the cyber domain under Article 5 to allow
for a rapid and coordinated response. The dominance of the US, the UK,
Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, known in government as the FVEY, or
Five-Eyes, highlights the urgent need for the alliance to develop policy
addressing the collective defence of NATO members. Effective policy for
NATO should address collective and coordinated cyberspace operations,
both offensive and defensive. Currently, NATO, as a military
institution, lacks "rules of engagement" for cyberspace and individual
member states lack a standardised threshold or response guidance.
Therefore, **[NATO must define the activities, "red lines", and
threshold incurring response]{.underline}**, as well as what a
coordinated kinetic/cyber response would entail. The interconnectedness
of European critical infrastructure, as illuminated by the Russian
ViaSat communications attack impacting German wind power generation and
distribution, highlights the requirement for NATO to address cyberspace
as the critical domain it is. As a result, we recommend:

- In the event of adversarial cyberspace actions warranting Article 5
  action, the NATO Commander becomes the commander and coordinator for
  all cyberspace activities, both defensive and offensive, by NATO
  nations within the area of hostilities.

- NATO identifies, establishes, prioritises, and continually refines
  critical infrastructure and key resources within member nations, as
  well as criteria for what constitutes necessary action for collective
  responses.

- NATO identifies limits of activity, or "red lines" resulting in
  Article 5 response discussions.

- NATO members present the NATO Commander intelligence identifying
  indications, warnings, and attribution of cyberspace attacks, both for
  response action and, where applicable, public consumption.

- NATO members present legal constraints and capabilities of nations to
  the NATO commander allowing maximisation of nations' capacity and
  capability.

NATO must recognise cyberspace for what it is---an interlocutor of
networks and devices from control systems for critical infrastructure to
seemingly anonymous devices operating in the background of our lives.
This interconnectedness by an invisible thread of information, however,
is the critical vulnerability in the stability of societies. [NATO must
plan to protect the infrastructure and key resources of member states as
a unified effort]{.underline}, not a piecemeal operation undertaken by a
few nations. In order to do this, NATO must identify and prioritise
infrastructure for protection, as well as criteria and policy for
action. [Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's increased
aggression, not solely in kinetic but also in non-kinetic realms, is a
stark reminder that the alternative to **further delay** of the
inevitable recognition of cyberspace for what it is will]{.underline},
ultimately, [prove to be **all the more costly**.]{.underline}

DALLAS, TEXAS, UNITED STATES, March 31, 2022 /EINPresswire.com/ \--
[Should Russia's attacks against us in the cyberwar space be considered
an **attack on NATO as a whole**]{.underline}?

This is a complicated question to answer. However, [in light of the
damage cyber warfare can inflict on society]{.underline}, from shutting
down computers at our nation's medical centers, water treatment plants,
transportation centers and banks, to disrupting the flow of capital from
financial institutions for our national defense, one should consider [a
cyberattack]{.underline} a violation of the Geneva Convention, a Crime
Against Peace, and an act that [should **trigger Article 5 of NATO's
treaty**]{.underline}.

Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty states that an attack on one is an
attack on all. This article is meant to foster a spirit of solidarity
with, and commitment to, all the members of this treaty, which now
numbers 30 nations. The only time Article 5 has been enacted to date was
after 9/11, when NATO collectively declared war against terrorism in
general, and specifically against the terror groups located in
Afghanistan under the command of Osama bin Laden.

**[Russia's guilt is clear]{.underline}**. We already know [Russia
meddled in America's elections in 2016]{.underline}. We have evidence
they continue to collect and interfere with our day-to-day operations in
business and private life. [Russia has large military outfits whose
focus is strictly on attacking civilians of nations it deems
hostile]{.underline} (like the United States). And [the White House
recently warned that the Putin government is searching out "options for
potential cyberattacks" on critical American infrastructure]{.underline}
in retaliation for Western sanctions following Russia's invasion of
Ukraine.

Cyberwarfare is a form of warfare with offensive and defensive
capabilities. Going forward, [NATO needs to send a **strong message**
that if Russia presses a **cyberattack** on any NATO nation, it is an
**act of war**]{.underline}---[and **NATO will respond
strongly**]{.underline} in kind.

[Russia needs to be stopped from **bullying the world**]{.underline}. In
light of Putin's anger at how pathetic his military is performing in
Ukraine, how isolated he must be feeling as the world cuts off the flow
of trade to and from his nation, and how the hatred for Russia grows as
its military kills innocent women and children (a clear violation of the
Geneva Convention), [Putin]{.underline} will likely resort to areas
where he can inflict harm. He will especially do so in a realm where the
world until now has not really held him accountable. After he [meddled
in the 2016 U.S. elections]{.underline}, shouldn't the world have
sanctioned him? [That was a direct attack on a
**democracy**]{.underline}. However, nothing was done. Isn't it time to
do something?

[How might we counterattack a cyberattack? According to Article 5, it
would be a full-on conventional attack]{.underline} across the board
from NATO. If Article 5 is to be taken seriously, the 30 nations of
**[NATO need to send a strong message to Putin]{.underline}** and his
Russian military goons that they cannot get away with causing death and
chaos in the world like they have been doing for years. Yes, Putin has
nuclear rockets and missiles---but [will he try and nuke the entire NATO
world? And what would that accomplish for him in return? It would mean
the nuclear obliteration of his own nation.]{.underline}

Dictators throughout time have repeatedly shown that as their power
increases, their reason decreases. With this in mind, [Putin's
threats]{.underline} about using atomic warfare against the West [needs
to be taken seriously.]{.underline} However, [if we want to remove Putin
from power and prevent his legions from causing further chaos, we must
**stand up to him and show him and the Russian people** that just
because you are willing to use nuclear weapons does not mean that enemy
nations are also not willing to use those same type of weapons against
you]{.underline}. In this respect, **[using Article 5 in the broadest
sense of its meaning should give Putin]{.underline}** (or at least his
military leadership) **[pause]{.underline}** before they enact
cyberwarfare, because they will understand the type of response it would
elicit from NATO countries. [Bullies usually **stand down when the
people they are picking on hit back**---and **hit back
harder**.]{.underline}

that's to blame]{.underline}. [**Insufficient response to its
non-kinetic military operations** helped equip the Kremlin with an
effective virtual complement to the traditional invasion]{.underline}.
[The West in effect conducted a policy of **digital appeasement in
response to multiple cyberattacks**]{.underline}. How did we get here,
and what can we do going ahead?

In 2015, Russia's military intelligence directorate launched a
cyberattack that knocked out power for over 200,000 Ukrainians two days
before Christmas. This was followed in June 2017 when shadowy Russian
actors compromised a popular tax accounting software called M.E. Doc,
which was later distributed to hundreds of thousands of customers via a
corrupted software update. Malware that was apparently intended for
local effects propagated globally, resulting in billions of dollars in
damages. It cost pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. an estimated \$1.3
billion alone.

More recently in the U.S., we have seen ransom attacks by Russian
cybergangs against various corporations and critical infrastructure,
including the Colonial pipeline and parts of the food chain. The 2020
SolarWinds Corp. attack, which affected hundreds of the largest
corporations in the U.S. and many government agencies, almost certainly
originated in Moscow.

Thus it should have come as no surprise that in recent days Ukraine's
largest bank and defense agencies reported being hit with the biggest
denial-of-service attack in the country's history. This, and subsequent
hacks, set the stage for the Thursday's military thrust.

Cyberwarfare is a powerful asymmetric capability for any nation-state
seeking to prepare the battlefield for an invasion; to support
operations at sea, in the air or on land; and to achieve disruptive or
destructive effects against digital or physical targets. Despite this
military effectiveness, however, far too often the West has failed to
respect cyberwarfare's role as a strategic instrument of power
projection.

[Russia wields the power of cyber]{.underline} not necessarily to cause
widespread damage, but [to operate with precision below the perceived
threshold of war, and thus beyond the reach of political
consequences]{.underline}. Cyberattacks are at the heart of Putin's
so-called hybrid warfare, central to the current Kremlin playbook. And
[the Western allies have allowed Russia to act virtually
unchallenged]{.underline} --- even when it has involved meddling in U.S.
and European elections --- **[evoking legitimate comparisons of European
appeasement]{.underline}** of the Nazis **[in]{.underline}** the lead-up
to **[World War II.]{.underline}**

[As cyberattacks start to resemble traditional acts of war in their
destructive power]{.underline}, initiatives like the EU's planned Joint
Cyber Unit aimed at "coordinated detection and response" will prove
inadequate for dealing with the problem. [Only a **bold doctrinal
innovation** of the **mutual defence clause** in **Article 5** of the
**North Atlantic Treaty**]{.underline}, based on a clear and
proportional deterrent which updates the contemporary meaning of "an
armed attack", [will prevent cyberwarfare from **escalating** and
compelling the use of **even more destructive means of waging war** in
the foreseeable future.]{.underline}

Point 32 of the Brussels Summit Communiqué of 14 June 2021 announcing
NATO's Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy (CCDP) takes the first
tentative step toward doing this. The statement asserts that: "the
Alliance is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all
times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum
of cyber threats... in accordance with international law." The CCDP also
recognises that "significant malicious cumulative cyber activities
might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed
attack", and it "reaffirm\[s\] that a decision as to when a cyberattack
would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North
Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis."

Despite the tough words, the communiqué merely reaffirms a strategically
muddled and dangerously ambiguous ad hoc policy of crisis management,
damage control, and maybe retaliating -- but only "in certain
circumstances". [An effective CCDP would]{.underline} instead [delineate
clearly where inviolable national boundaries lie in
cyberspace]{.underline}; formulate what a "proportionate response" could
look like after a debilitating attack on any of the 16 critical
infrastructure sectors; [and incorporate these policies into an
**updated mutual defence doctrine** based on a **revised version of
Article 5**.]{.underline}

[China's increasingly aggressive approach to cyber warfare]{.underline}
-- which has recently evolved from an established pattern of technology
theft to Russian-style disruption employing a wide range of
highly-skilled domestic hackers who attack without restraint -- [gives
further context to the urgency of effective cyber
deterrence]{.underline}.

[We have a clear choice: the transatlantic democratic alliance will
either **vigorously deter**]{.underline} potentially costly aggression
in any theatre of conflict, including cyberspace, and defend the values
fought for in two world wars and numerous other bloody conflicts since
1945; [or we will **surrender** to the current **assault** on **liberal
democratic norms**]{.underline} from Russia, China and their
opportunistic allies, [and accept their vision of a **post-liberal,
post-democratic world** as our inevitable collective future, as we cede
the new art of modern warfare to them]{.underline}.

[The stakes could not be higher.]{.underline}

Yet beyond use of military force, [Russia would be even bolder with
different approaches]{.underline}. The year [2014 saw]{.underline}
Russian "active" [hybrid measures support]{.underline} the 2014
**[Scottish secession]{.underline}** campaign in the UK;
**[2016]{.underline}**, the **[Brexit]{.underline}** campaign, [a failed
**coup attempt** in Montenegro]{.underline} designed to thwart its entry
into NATO, among other aims; [the campaign to weaken and destabilize the
U.S. by installing]{.underline} Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** as the
U.S. president in what I called back in December, 2016, the First
Russo-American Cyberwar, which involved major efforts by Prigozhin in
one of his other major capacities: helping to run Russia's cyberwarfare
(indeed, as I have written before, he is a real nexus of Russian
international aggression). Since then, [Russia has interfered with
**Catalonia's secessionist campaign** and German, French, Austrian,
Italian, British, Dutch, Swedish, (North) Macedonian, Ukrainian,
Bulgarian, Moldovan, and, even]{.underline} now in 2020, [American
votes]{.underline}. Also currently, Putin may be prepping for a military
intervention in Belarus to crush a democratic uprising there, and [we
should not forget more general cyberattacks on Finland and the steady
stream of cyberattacks against the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania.]{.underline}

There seem to be [even]{.underline} still [more countries]{.underline}
that [have been the target of Russian political interference and
cyberwarfare]{.underline}.

With a large portion of these [Russian campaigns]{.underline}, Putin has
expertly [manipulated]{.underline} what czars and comrades alike had
often skillfully manipulated throughout Russian and Soviet history both
within Russia and throughout is periphery:
**[nationalism]{.underline}**. And [many of these campaigns are
part]{.underline}, as I have noted before, of a larger Russian [war
against the West mean to **destroy, NATO, European unity,
and**]{.underline} even **[Western democracy]{.underline}** as we know
it.

In his 1931 book Conversations with Oscar Wilde, A. H. Cooper-Prichard
presented the following exchange with the book's namesake: "'How is it,'
I once asked him, 'that people who are not possessed of a single other
virtue should come out at times as patriots?' 'Exaggerated patriotism,'
he answered, 'is the most insincere form of self-conceit.' And at
another time he said, 'Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious.'" And in
his "Notes on Nationalism," Orwell---who would use the term
"nationalism" as Wilde used "patriotism,"---wrote that "nationalist
thought" could be characterized primarily by "obsession," "instability,"
and "indifference to reality," that one of the great dangers he saw for
nationalism was that it "may work in a merely negative sense, against
something or other and without the need for any positive object of
loyalty." Orwell here famously defined nationalism as

> first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified
> like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of
> people can be confidently labelled 'good' or 'bad'. But secondly --
> and this is much more important -- I mean the habit of identifying
> oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and
> evil and recognizing no other duty than that of advancing its
> interests.

As [Putin acts as a **maestro** conducting an **orchestra of nationalism
on a global scale**]{.underline} to his ends in 2020 in ways most of us
could have hardly imagined back in 2008, it is useful to look at how the
Georgia war---this first great foreign campaign of Putin's---can be a
window into the world of nationalism, showing how banal and, sadly,
normal ethno-nationalism can be. This is true globally, and I used
excerpts from my 2009 graduate school paper that discussed nationalism
in Georgian history to shed light---just weeks before his socking
victory in the United States---on the rise of the similarly thoroughly
unoriginal, bland, and boring nationalism of then-candidate Trump.

That exploration of my older 2009 work---which in important ways was
especially enriched by Ronald Grigor Suny's deconstruction of
nationalism as a very much consciously constructed phenomenon with two
main sides: inclusion and exclusion---in a 2016 context has only
increased in relevance thanks to what President Trump and Trumpism have
become: the largest force in American politics since George Wallace to
be built so nakedly on inclusion and exclusion. The president does not
even attempt to hide that white ethno-nationalism is what will be
included in, and other identities excluded from, the top position in the
national hierarchy. This [white, exclusionary
ethno-nationalism]{.underline}, which he fanned and flamed into the
White House with substantial Russian support, [has only gotten more
extreme and more powerful]{.underline} since then and [today has plenty
of sensible people worried about the prospects of both **civil war and
the death of true American democracy**]{.underline}.

divide?\". 8-6-2021.
https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/

[The **divergence in cyber policy** across NATO member states is
**problematic**. Allies **disagree** on]{.underline} both the [**goals

operating on each other's [national systems and networks]{.underline}.

Some may argue that these differences result from differences in
maturity. Some states simply have not caught up with the latest
developments, goes the argument. This assumes a single path to cyber
maturity or that the dynamics of cyberspace pull all states in the same
direction. It suggests that -- even without major policy coordination --
allies' cyber policies will converge over time. But a more persuasive
understanding of the current trend is that even though states can learn
from each other's institutional progress, [differences do not merely
stem from states "lagging behind." These states are on a **different
policy path**]{.underline}. This means it requires dedicated and
sustained policy attention to, at a minimum, coordinating the different
policies of states -- and potentially bring them closer together.

Strategy for a Digital Age\". Council on Foreign Relations.
https://www.cfr.org/blog/natos-deterrence-problem-analog-strategy-digital-age

Given these stakes, NATO has an obvious incentive to strengthen its
capacity to deter and punish cyberattacks, including through
conventional retaliation. A U.S. Department of Defense memorandum
published in early 2017 stated that at least for the next decade,
[offensive cyber capabilities are likely to outpace cyber defense,
making **deterrence the most viable option**]{.underline}. Both the
United States and NATO also recognize that **[a devastating cyberattack
could quickly escalate]{.underline}** to violent conflict by triggering
a conventional response. Unfortunately, [the alliance's policy of
strategic ambiguity falls short]{.underline}. By failing to define the
rules of engagement for retaliation, [the alliance leaves open the
potential for chaos in determining an appropriate response to
cyberattacks. In doing so, it invites adversaries to **test the
waters**]{.underline}.

**\-\--1NC CARDS STARTS\-\--**

[Cyber deterrence is **inherently more challenging** than nuclear or
conventional deterrence because such attacks are **difficult to
definitively attribute**]{.underline} to a particular actor. For
example, [it is easier to **mask the source of a
cyberattack**]{.underline} on a power grid than it would have been for
the Warsaw Pact to conceal a massive incursion into West Germany. [This
**attribution problem** could complicate NATO's capacity to conclusively
determine the source of a cyberattack and justify and conduct a timely
conventional response, particularly if **member states diverge in their
perceptions**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} dilemma [could **strain
the foundations of collective defense** and **undermine any unified
front** against cyberattacks.]{.underline}

[For NATO]{.underline} to commit to military action,
**[all]{.underline}** of its **[members would need
certainty]{.underline}**, beyond a reasonable doubt, [about the identity
of the perpetrator]{.underline}. This is particularly true in the case
of Russia---a known sponsor of cyberattacks. [**Without conclusive
proof**, it might be a challenge to convince a distant country like
Portugal or]{.underline} a dangerously close one like [Estonia to
join]{.underline} in a counterattack. [Complicating matters, such
post-attack decisions would need to be made quickly]{.underline}, given
Russia's precedent of using cyberwarfare as a precursor to kinetic
invasion. The need for speed leaves little room for philosophical
debates over what constitutes an act of war.

**\-\--1NC CARD ENDS\-\--**

To be sure, NATO's strategic ambiguity is not without its benefits.
Uncertainty about the threshold for a military response could persuade
an adversary not to push the envelope with an audacious attack. But that
same ambiguity could lead an adversary to miscalculate. Moreover, the
doctrine also leaves open the possibility of discord in the ranks of
NATO member states regarding how to deal with any such attack.

NATO's policy of strategic ambiguity served it well during the long Cold
War nuclear confrontation. But it may be less appropriate to the era of
cyberwarfare, particularly given the problem of attribution and the
potential for inter-allied disagreement on the appropriate response to
any particular incident. [NATO policymakers need to resolve this dilemma
by **formulating a more explicit cyberwarfare doctrine**]{.underline} to
which all of its member states can adhere. [This should include updating
their mutual understanding of what constitutes an act of aggression
under NATO's collective defense provisions, **making
explicit**]{.underline} to potential adversaries just what its **[red
lines]{.underline}** are, and establishing clear procedures and channels
for robust allied response to cyberattacks. [Unless NATO clarifies
current ambiguities, **Russian aggression in the cyber realm could go
unchecked**.]{.underline}

### AT: Only Deterrence by Denial\-\--2AC 

#### Both punishment and denial are cybersecurity strategies.

[**Denial and deterrence cybersecurity strategies** are **different
approaches to achieve the same goal**]{.underline}: a safer digital
environment. [These strategies are not mutually exclusive]{.underline}.
As seen by the Commission's recommendations, particular activities can
serve both strategies, and combining activities can have a multiplier
effect on the actions.

Generally, [for **cybersecurity**]{.underline}, [denial]{.underline}
strategies [seek to improve technology]{.underline}, processes, and
practices over something in one's own control so that despite an
adversary's efforts, their success rate is low. **[Deterrence strategies
seek to affect the behavior of other individuals or
entities]{.underline}**--- stopping them from engaging in an unwanted
activity. The DOD developed descriptions of "denial" and "deterrence,"
which are used in this report in the context of cybersecurity to
categorize activities and provide a framework for discussing policy
options.

Glossary

Denial [A denial measure is an action to hinder or deny the enemy the
use of territory, personnel, or facilities]{.underline}. It may include
destruction, removal, contamination, or erection of obstructions. 11

Deterrence [Deterrence prevents adversary action through the
**presentation of a credible threat**]{.underline} of unacceptable
counteraction and belief that the cost of the action outweighs the
perceived benefits.12

### XT\-\--Includes Offensive\-\--1AR 

#### [Offensive usage]{.underline} is [cybersecurity]{.underline}!

[Cybersecurity includes a broad range of tools, applications, and
concepts which are closely related to informational and operational
defence. It involves the **offensive usage of information technology for
attacking adversaries**]{.underline}. According to technology
practitioners the term cybersecurity should only be used for security
purposes that involve information or operational technology systems51.
[Cybersecurity is defined as the development, management, governance and
use of operations security]{.underline}, information security, and
Information Technology security techniques and tools [in order to defend
assets, **compromise the assets of adversaries**, and achieve regulatory
compliance]{.underline}52. Cyber defence is a computer-based network
defence mechanism that provides responses to certain actions and
protection to precarious infrastructure and information assurance for
government entities, organizations and other related networks. [Cyber
defence]{.underline} is very important in order to prevent sensitive
data and information and to safeguard assets. It [involves]{.underline}
prevention, detection, and provision of timely **[responses to threats
or attacks]{.underline}**. It provides assurance to work and run
different processes and activities without worrying about threats or
attacks53.

Cyber operations are an emerging field in which the DOD and the
intelligence community are highly integrated with the private sector and
where contractors perform mission critical functions. In 2017, the
United States government authorized \$19.8 billion in unclassified
spending for all cyber related activities performed by defense
contractors, an increase of 120 percent over 2012 levels.8 Scholars have
advanced several typologies to classify varying types of cyber
operations. While academic debate in this area is likely to persist,
[there is emerging consensus that distinct differences exist among
**cybersecurity**]{.underline}---**[which includes defensive cyber
operations]{.underline}**,9 **[offensive cyber operations, and data
analytics]{.underline}**.10 What follows is an analysis of outsourcing
in these three strategically important cyber markets.

\"[The President directed a]{.underline} 60-day, [**comprehensive,
\'clean-slate\' review** to assess **U.S. policies**]{.underline} and
structures [**for cybersecurity**. Cybersecurity policy includes
strategy, policy, and standards regarding the security of and operations
in cyberspace, and encompasses the full range]{.underline} of threat
reduction, vulnerability reduction, [**deterrence**, **international
engagement**, **incident response**]{.underline}, resiliency, **[and
recovery policies]{.underline}** and activities, [including]{.underline}
computer network operations, information assurance, law enforcement,
diplomacy, **[military]{.underline}**, and intelligence [**missions** as
they relate to the security and stability of the global information and
communications infrastructure]{.underline}. The scope does not include
other information and communications policy unrelated to national
security or securing the infrastructure. [The review team of
**government cybersecurity experts** engaged and received input from a
**broad cross-section** of **industry, academia, the civil liberties and
privacy communities, State governments, international partners, and the
Legislative and Executive Branches**]{.underline}. This paper summarizes
the review team\'s conclusions and outlines the beginning of the way
forward towards a reliable, resilient, trustworthy digital
infrastructure for the future.\"
