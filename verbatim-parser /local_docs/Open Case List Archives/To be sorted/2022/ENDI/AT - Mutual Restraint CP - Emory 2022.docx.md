Let me be clear at the outset about what I am not arguing: **[I do not
advocate]{.underline}** that political and **[military leaders
abandon]{.underline}** current [**objectives of bolstering cyber
deterrence** in favor of a singular reliance on international
diplomacy]{.underline} to manage cyber rivalry. Just like during the
Cold War's nuclear standoff, [international arms control and strategic
deterrence **must go hand-in-hand** if we are to succeed in reducing the
risk of global cyber conflict]{.underline}. However, I argue, creating
an international legal framework to govern cyber warfare would abet
efforts to achieve stable cyber deterrence. Indeed, many of the problems
that currently undermine effective cyber deterrence (including
difficulties of attribution, difficulties in distinguishing hostile
attacks from innocent mistakes, lack of clarity about what constitutes
an attack under international law, and---closely related to
this---lacking credibility of retaliatory threats) would be greatly
alleviated by the articulation of clear, binding international rules and
norms that would both serve to distinguish lawful from unlawful behavior
and facilitate punishment of cyber aggressors. [My
argument]{.underline}, in other words, [is that international arms
control and the desire to strengthen states' individual
capacities]{.underline} to deter cyber aggressors **[are not
antithetical goals but present mutually supportive
strategies]{.underline}**.

[One common reaction to coordination problems]{.underline}, particularly
in the international sphere, [is to **negotiate a treaty and make
binding or "hard" law** on the topic]{.underline}. There are obvious
advantages to this. Treaties have the force of law. Theoretically, there
should be enforcement by governments of their provisions. Treaties also
offer at least an illusion of clarity since they usually spell out
details of the agreement and explain rules in great detail. But
**[negotiating treaties can be a slow and cumbersome process, ill-suited
to fast-changing issues like cyber security]{.underline}** and Internet
governance. [Governments may also not be the best or only actors to be
making rules in this area since so much of the technology is in private
hands.]{.underline}

\"Hacks Are Prompting Calls For A Cyber Agreement, But Reaching One
Would Be Tough\". NPR.org. 7-2-2021.
https://www.npr.org/2021/07/02/1009925791/hacks-are-prompting-calls-for-a-cyber-agreement-but-reaching-one-would-be-tough

Such discussions have been kicking around for years, but many [cyber
experts remain deeply skeptical that]{.underline} such [an agreement
could be **reached**, let alone **enforced**.]{.underline}

Cyber strikes are low-cost and high-reward

[The first big challenge would be simply getting everyone to
agree]{.underline} to the rules. [Russia]{.underline}, China, Iran and
North Korea [have all been blamed for significant hacks against the
U.S.,]{.underline} and analysts say those countries see cyber strikes as
cheap, effective and easy to deny.

[It\'s not]{.underline} even [clear]{.underline} if [such countries
would be willing to **actually agree to terms**, because cyber attacks
for them are \"really useful in their **geopolitical
positioning**]{.underline},\" April Falcon Doss, a former National
Security Agency official who now heads a technology program at
Georgetown\'s law school, tells NPR.

Compared to the arms agreements between the U.S. and Soviet Union, **[a
cyber treaty would be extremely difficult to monitor and
enforce]{.underline}**. That\'s because the [production, development and
stockpiling of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons is fundamentally
different from]{.underline} the ephemeral nature of [cyber
weapons]{.underline}, says Doss.

\"If the question is whether or not a signatory to a nuclear arms
control treaty is building up their nuclear stockpile, there will almost
certainly be some evidence, factory production, storage of nuclear
weapons,\" she says. \"There will be satellite imagery or there will be
on the ground reports.\"

Tests of nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles, such as those carried
out by North Korea in recent years, are also relatively simple to
monitor compared to the challenge of keeping an eye on the dark corners
of the Internet to track down new cyber weapons, Doss says.

\"**[Detecting their development is much harder because you don\'t have
big stockpiles]{.underline}** of missiles sitting around and there\'s
nothing that\'s visible in that sense,\" she says.

Thomas Graham, a U.S.-Russia expert at the Council on Foreign Relations,
says [any analogy to a Cold War-style arms agreement would be
**tenuous**.]{.underline}

\"**[We\'re dealing with computer code. So this is radically
different]{.underline}** from some nuclear weapons,\" he tells NPR.

[Prospects for meaningful cyber negotiations with the Russian
Federation]{.underline}, **[let alone a bilateral agreement or cyber
treaty]{.underline}**, [seem]{.underline} almost **[impossible to
imagine today]{.underline}**. Our [anguish over Russia's meddling in
**American elections**]{.underline}, preoccupation with alleged ties
between the Trump administration and the Russian government during the
recently concluded Mueller investigation, [and major disagreements on
geopolitical issues including **Ukraine**, **Syria**, and **Venezuela**,
have left us at an **impasse**. Instead of genuine dialogue]{.underline}
between the United States and Russia, [we see the two nations **talking
past each other** and **posturing** to both domestic and international
audiences.]{.underline}

More alarmingly, **[the very framework of bilateral and multilateral
arms control]{.underline}** treaties that got us through the last
decades of the Cold War, starting in 1972 with the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty and the interim Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement
(SALT I), [**is in disarray**. This]{.underline} process of
[unraveling]{.underline} likely [began in 2002 when the U.S. withdrew
from the ABM Treaty. The Russian Federation suspended its participation
in the1992 Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty]{.underline} in
2007 and completely halted its participation in 2015. Most recently,
[the U.S. announced, on]{.underline} February 22, [2019, its intent to
withdraw from the]{.underline} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
([INF]{.underline}) Treaty signed in 1987.

[Given these developments, **proponents of treaties with
Russia**]{.underline}, whether bilateral or multilateral, now **[seem
few and far between]{.underline}**. Even [the architects of past
agreements must justifiably wonder **what has become of their life's
work**]{.underline}. How, then, might negotiations leading to a cyber
treaty be a viable policy option?

[The cyber operations]{.underline} detailed in Chapter 2
[vary]{.underline} greatly in scale and scope. The victim states
responded to the operations with varying types and levels of
countermeasures. Because nation-state use of cyber operations is
increasing in frequency year on year, the need for an international law
framework is growing. Chapter 3 explores the application of existing
international law to cyber operations with the specific focus on pre-war
conditions. This research does not focus on cyber operations as they
relate to the law of armed conflict. A nation's understanding of this
application applies directly to its use of cyber operations and can shed
significant light on an adversary's possible actions. [**Agreement
between Moscow and the West on the threshold of cyber-attacks below the
level of armed conflict may be difficult**. Russia and the West have
**quite different views on what is a retaliation-worthy
attack**]{.underline} (Segal The Hacked World Order : How Nations Fight,
Trade, Maneuver, and Manipulate in the Digital Age 105). [In 1996, the
US and Russia secretly met in Moscow to discuss a possible international
treaty framework, specifically relating to cyberspace, but **no
agreement was reached.**]{.underline}

#### Concedes negotiations are fraught! 

NOTE\-\--ICWC = International Cyberwar Convention

World Needs an International Cyberwar Convention\". SpringerLink.

[The arguments presented in this article should not be read as a
statement of ingenuous optimism]{.underline}. **[Negotiating an ICWC
will be fraught with difficulty]{.underline}** given the diverse
interests at stake, **[and the task will not be accomplished
overnight]{.underline}**. Nonetheless, I argue, most standard objections
to embarking on a process of international negotiation (including
difficulties of verifying compliance and problems of rapid technological
change) fail on closer inspection. In the end, [the main barrier to an
international agreement on governing cyberconflict may be **opposition
by powerful**]{.underline} (mainly) western [**states**, whose desire to
exploit current strategic advantages in the cyber-domain leads them to
reject a treaty]{.underline}. For example, many observers judge that
America's enduring hostility towards binding international rules for
cyberspace is driven largely by its technological superiority in the
realm of tactical electronic warfare, which provides a strong incentive
to maintain maximum freedom of action in this domain (see Baruah 2013;
Clarke and Knake 2010; Sanger 2015; Lindsay 2015, 46, 61--62; Sanger
2015; Goldsmith 2011). Not only would America be reluctant to bargain
away its ability to exploit current tactical advantages, but as the
world's strongest cyber power, American decision-makers may fear that by
accepting binding international constraints on the conduct of cyber
warfare, they would be trying their own hands while allowing other
nations to rapidly catch up (see Singer and Friedman 2014).

### Internet Freedom DA\-\--2AC 

#### Russia uses the counterplan to shut down [internet freedom]{.underline}. 

Todd **Prince 19**. Senior correspondent for RFE/RL based in Washington,
D.C. \"U.S. Concerned Russia-Backed UN Resolution Will Hurt Online
Freedom\". RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty. 12-20-2019.
https://www.rferl.org/a/us-russia-internet-un/30335318.html

The resolution \-- Countering The Use Of Information And Communications
Technologies For Criminal Purposes \-- would create a new cybercrime
treaty written by [Russia]{.underline}, a country analysts have said [is
cracking down on Internet freedom]{.underline} at home to stifle
opposition to the Kremlin.

"**[The Russians clearly are interested in pushing their vision of what
the Internet should look like]{.underline}** in the future, and [that's
conflating]{.underline} this idea of cybercrime with [cybersecurity and
cyber controls]{.underline}," a State Department official told media on
December 19.

[Russia wants "a form of **lockdown on information**" over the Internet
and a "**curtailment of those freedoms**"]{.underline} that the United
States stands for, the State Department official said.

The UN General Assembly vote comes less than two months after Russia's
so-called "sovereign Internet" law came into force. The controversial
law requires providers to install equipment that could route Russian web
traffic through points that are controlled by the state. Critics say
"sovereign Internet law" legislation is an attempt to increase
censorship.

Pass The UNGA

Washington fears the UN General Assembly will pass the bill because many
countries don't understand the complexities, the official said. Russia
has also been lobbying countries for years about the issue.

"On its surface, certainly a cybercrime treaty sounds like a good idea.
Who wouldn't want it? The problem is in trying to explain to those
countries not as familiar with this issue set that there are mechanisms
already existent and that [what the Russians are really driving at is a
problematic issue]{.underline}," the official said.

#### That collapses [human rights]{.underline}.

matters\".

Defining and **[preserving internet freedom is a key and growing
challenge]{.underline}**. In an astonishingly short period of time [the
internet has become the greatest purveyor of news and
information]{.underline} in history **[and a potent catalyst for
innovation and commerce]{.underline}**. From a small band of university
researchers sharing documents to more than a billion people now
connecting in real-time around the globe, [the internet has proven to be
a **force multiplier for freedom**, in even the most remote corners of
the globe.]{.underline}

But [the internet has]{.underline} also [become a lightning rod for
**repressive governments**]{.underline} as they try to restrict or block
freedom of expression. Right now [there are people imprisoned in
countries like China, Cuba, and Iran simply for expressing their
peaceful views online. The United States is determined to
**maximise**]{.underline} the free flow of **[information]{.underline}**
over the internet **[and minimise success by repressive
regimes]{.underline}** in censoring information and silencing legitimate
debate in this global town hall. Nonetheless, we oppose illicit online
activities, such as copyright infringement, child pornography crimes,
and criminal incitement to commit violent acts.

In recent months, numerous journalists have detailed the complex moral
calculus that emerges when governments --- such as China's --- try to
control freedom of expression on the internet.

Fundamentally, [internet freedom stems from the principles of freedom of
expression enshrined in]{.underline} the Universal Declaration of
**[Human Rights and human rights law]{.underline}**. On this basis, [we
oppose the efforts of non-democratic governments to misuse the internet
to **restrict freedom of expression**]{.underline} or to track and
prosecute dissidents. [Promoting access to information over the Internet
can advance the goals of **good governance**, **economic development**,
support for **innovation**, and a vibrant **civil
society**]{.underline}. Transparency --- informing users about changes
or restrictions on content --- holds governments engaged in censorship
accountable for their actions. More broadly, **[effective rule of law is
essential]{.underline}** when companies are asked to turn over internet
user data or to block Internet information.

#### Allowing human rights abuses is morally unacceptable and causes war

Correlation", The Harvard Human Rights Journal, Spring, 17 Harv. Hum.
Rts. J. 249, Lexis)

This Article presents a strategic\--as opposed to ideological or
normative\--argument that [the promotion of human rights should be given
a more prominent place in U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. It does so
by suggesting a correlation between the domestic human rights practices
of states and their propensity to engage in aggressive international
conduct. [Among the chief threats to]{.underline} U.S. [national
security are acts of aggression by other states]{.underline}. Aggressive
acts of war may directly endanger the United States, as did the Japanese
bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, or they may require U.S. military
action overseas, as in Kuwait fifty years later. [Evidence]{.underline}
from the post-Cold War period  \[\*250\]  [indicates that states that
systematically abuse]{.underline} their own citizens\' [human rights
are]{.underline} also [those most likely to engage in aggression. To the
degree that improvements in various states\' human rights records
decrease the likelihood of aggressive war]{.underline}, a foreign
[policy informed by human rights can significantly enhance]{.underline}
U.S. and **[global security]{.underline}**.

Since 1990, [a state\'s domestic human rights policy appears to be a
telling indicator of that state\'s propensity to engage in international
aggression]{.underline}. A central element of U.S. foreign policy has
long been the preservation of peace and the prevention of such acts of
aggression.

If [the correlation]{.underline} discussed herein is accurate, it
[provides U.S. policymakers with a **powerful new tool to enhance
national security through the promotion of human rights**]{.underline}.
A strategic linkage between national security and human rights would
result in a number of important policy modifications. First, it changes
the prioritization of those countries U.S. policymakers have identified
as presenting the greatest concern. Second, it alters some of the policy
prescriptions for such states. Third, it offers states a means of
signaling benign international intent through the improvement of their
domestic human rights records. Fourth, it provides a way for a current
government to prevent future governments from aggressive international
behavior through the institutionalization of human rights protections.
Fifth, [it addresses the]{.underline} particular [threat of]{.underline}
human rights abusing [states obtaining]{.underline} weapons of mass
destruction (**[WMD]{.underline}**). Finally, it offers a mechanism for
U.S.-U.N. cooperation on human rights issues.

[A global comprehensive treaty to counter cybercrime]{.underline} first
[proposed by Russia]{.underline} has gained enough support at the United
Nations for negotiations to begin early next year. In addition to the
irony of a government that faces criticism for turning a blind eye to
cybercriminals operating within its borders pushing a global cybercrime
treaty, the proposal [is **dangerous**]{.underline}. [A binding
international treaty has the potential to **expand government
regulation**]{.underline} of online content **[and reshape law
enforcement access]{.underline}** to data [in a way that could
**criminalize free expression** and **undermine privacy**]{.underline}.

Until now, [there has been very little scrutiny of this process from a
**human rights**]{.underline} -- as opposed to a geopolitical --
**[perspective]{.underline}**. A closer look at who is proposing the
treaty, [the way many states have defined "crime" in the cyber
context]{.underline}, how efforts to fight cybercrime have undermined
rights, and the shortcomings of multilateral negotiating processes
[reveals the **dangers**]{.underline} that this treaty process poses.

In recent years, there has been a surge in cybercrime laws around the
world, some of which are overly broad and undermine human rights.
[Governments]{.underline} often use them to [persecute journalists,
human rights defenders, technologists, opposition politicians, lawyers,
religious reformers, and artists]{.underline}. Many
**[governments]{.underline}**, including some that are most supportive
of a global treaty, **[treat forms of free expression]{.underline}**
such as criticism and dissent [**as crimes**. A cybercrime treaty that
normalizes this approach runs **counter to human rights
obligations**]{.underline}.
