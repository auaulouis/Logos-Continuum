## AT: Midterms Disad

### Too Soon\-\--2AC 

#### [Too soon]{.underline}\-\--elections are decided the [day before]{.underline}.

The Republican Party rarely polls ahead of Democrats on the generic
ballot, according to political scientist Lara Brown, who directs the
Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University.
For Democrats to come back and win elections, they need to make
significant gains in public support. But, she added, [**it's too early,
and political churn is too volatile**, to know which party will emerge
victorious from the midterms]{.underline}.

"**[Twelve hours is an eternity in politics]{.underline}**," Brown said.

### UQ\-\--Dems Win\-\--2AC

#### Dems win now\-\--conventional wisdom doesn't apply to modern politics.

Republicans retake Congress\". . 3-29-2022.
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/29/nancy-pelosi-democracy-republicans-congress

But [Pelosi said: "I don't have any intention of the Democrats losing
the Congress in November."]{.underline}

[Rejecting]{.underline} "so-called [conventional wisdom]{.underline}"
about midterm elections[, the speaker said: "**There's nothing
conventional anymore**]{.underline}, because of [the way people
communicate with social media and how they receive their information,
how they are called to action, how they're called to
meetings]{.underline} and the rest is quite different. So **[any past
assumptions about elections are obsolete]{.underline}**."

"**[We]{.underline}** do **[have a plan]{.underline}**," she added. "[We
have a vision of the **victory**. We will plan]{.underline} to get it
done **[and we're going to own the ground]{.underline}**."

[Pelosi]{.underline} also [cast doubt on the accuracy of polling about
Biden's favourability and said redistricting]{.underline}, a process
widely thought to favour Republicans, who control more state
governments, [would not]{.underline} necessarily [leave Democrats at a
disadvantage.]{.underline}

"Everybody said redistricting was going to be horrible for the
Democrats," Pelosi said. "Remember that? Not so. Not so. If anything,
**[we'll pick up seats rather than lose 10 to 15]{.underline}**, which
conventional wisdom said that we would. **[There's nothing conventional
anymore]{.underline}**, and it certainly ain't wisdom.

"And **[nobody's going to be rejecting the president]{.underline}**."

### UQ\-\--AT: Polls\-\--2AC 

#### Can't predict bias in this cycle's polling

Have Plenty To Tell Us About November,\" FiveThirtyEight,
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-early-senate-and-governor-polls-have-plenty-to-tell-us-about-november/

But [[good luck guessing]{.mark} the direction of the [bias]{.mark} of
early 2022 polls]{.underline}. True, [[in the last four cycles, early
Senate polls]{.mark} have been about 3 to 6 points [too good for
Dem]{.mark}]{.underline}ocrat[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[But]{.underline} [in three of the four cycles before
that]{.underline}]{.mark}[, early Senate [polls]{.mark} had
[overestimated]{.mark} [Republicans]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and early
gubernatorial polls overestimated Republicans in 2018, too. Moreover,
[as the 2018 cycle showed, [one set]{.mark} of polls [could be skewed
toward one party]{.mark}, while surveys for [another]{.mark} office
could end up [biased toward the other]{.mark} party.]{.underline} Though
the 2022 electoral environment is shaping up to be advantageous for the
GOP, [[just how accurately]{.mark} the [polls gauge races remains to be

### UQ/No Link\-\--Structural UQ Overwhelms\-\--2AC

#### Dems will lose\-\--fundamentals\-\--Russia-based popularity boost is irrelevant. 

Ed **Kilgore 3/10/22**. \"Biden's War Bounce Isn't Big Enough to Save
the Midterms\". Intelligencer. 8-30-2021.
https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/03/bidens-war-bounce-isnt-big-enough-to-save-the-midterms.html

The question we really can't answer now is whether future developments
in Ukraine will help or hurt Biden's popularity. [Short of an **outright
Russian defeat**]{.underline} or the deployment of U.S. troops, [it's
not easy to envision a trajectory of events that will greatly affect
Biden's standing]{.underline}. The short-term economic fallout is likely
to be negative; if it's very negative, and Biden fails to make a
Churchillian appeal for sacrifice, it could make it very hard for him to
recover popular support for the most important "real life" indicator,
particularly among independents.

[What we do know is the party controlling the White House **almost
always loses ground in the midterms**]{.underline} except for rare
occasions where the president was unusually popular. And [even if
Biden's job-approval rating stabilizes or]{.underline} modestly
[improves]{.underline}, **[he's a long way from what he'd need for his
party to triumph in November]{.underline}**. As Vox's Andrew Prokop
recently put it:

> [The historical pattern is **clear**]{.underline}, and ominous for Joe
> Biden and Democrats this year: [The president's party usually does
> poorly in midterm elections.]{.underline}
>
> "[It's not quite a law of physics, but it's probably **as close as
> you're going to get in the social sciences**]{.underline}," says
> Carlos Algara, a professor of political science at Claremont Graduate
> University.

[On the two occasions since 1934 when that near law of physics has been
broken, the president in office had job-approval ratings **above 60
percent**]{.underline}. [In 1962]{.underline}, John F. [Kennedy had an
approval rating of 61 percent, and **Democrats still lost four House
seats**]{.underline}, which happens to be exactly the maximum number of
seats Democrats can afford to lose in November without losing the House
and their governing trifecta.

So [even with the modest good news Democrats have been
given]{.underline} in the redistricting process, **[they will need a lot
more than a "bump" in Biden's approval ratings]{.underline}** to
overcome history and logic. Yes, stabilizing and marginally improving
Biden's popularity can place a floor on Democratic losses and perhaps
(with some luck and a lot of Trump-fueled Republican stumbling) even
save the Senate. But [the blunt truth is that barring a dazzlingly
successful Biden presidency]{.underline} --- one that extends his
popularity beyond his party deep into the ranks of independents and even
Republicans --- [Democrats have **already lost**]{.underline}. **[They
sealed their fate in November 2020 when they carried the House by such a
surprisingly small margin]{.underline}**. [Nothing]{.underline} Biden
has done right or wrong since then [has changed that fundamental
reality]{.underline}.

### UQ/No Link\-\--Other Issues Outweigh\-\--2AC

Washington Post. 5-16-2022.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/big-picture-2022-midterms/

[Every election has a story.]{.underline}

In 2010, the story was an angry tea party movement and a rebellion
against President Barack Obama's newly enacted Affordable Care Act. In
2018, it was a backlash, fueled by the energy and fury of suburban
women, against the chaotic governing style and misogynistic belligerence
of President Donald Trump.

[The stories]{.underline} of some elections are often clearer in
retrospect than they are in the moment, but there [were blinking lights
throughout 2010 and 2018 that the party in control of the White House
was heading for trouble. **The same can be said for 2022**]{.underline}.
President [**Biden's approval ratings are in the danger zone**,
putting]{.underline} the [Democrats']{.underline} slender majorities
[in]{.underline} the House and Senate in **[jeopardy]{.underline}**.
Many [Democratic leaders are already braced]{.underline}, at a minimum,
[to lose control of the House.]{.underline}

Political volatility has become commonplace in a nation as deeply and
closely divided as America today. [Seven of the last eight elections
qualify as change elections]{.underline} --- a shift in the balance in
some important way. And, if Republicans were to capture the House and
Senate in November, Biden would become the fifth consecutive president
to see his party lose both chambers of Congress on his watch.

But other than Democratic nervousness, **[what is the story of this
year? What is motivating voters?]{.underline}** What forces are steering
the election, other than the tides of history?

[Analysts point to a nation weary]{.underline} at a time in which there
seems no escape from disorder, [whether it be]{.underline} the long bout
with the **[coronavirus]{.underline}** or **[soaring prices or rising
crime rates]{.underline}** in cities **[or]{.underline}** surging
crossings of undocumented **[immigrants]{.underline}** at the southern
border. Added to all of that is the brutal war of aggression in Ukraine
launched without provocation by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a
conflict that is redrawing the international order.

"[This is a country that is **exhausted from politics**]{.underline},"
said Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik, who served in the Clinton
administration. "**[It's exhausted from covid]{.underline}**. [It's
exhausted from uncertainty]{.underline}. [It's **exhausted from
inflation**]{.underline}. It's exhausted from the world unraveling.
[That's not great when you're in charge]{.underline}. But the second
factor is disappointment. There was a notion that with Biden taking
office we were going to come back to a sense of normalcy in the world."

"[Independent voters decide elections]{.underline},\" said Richard
Czuba, a Michigan-based analyst. \"Right now \[[in
Michigan]{.underline}\] [they are really worried about
**inflation**]{.underline} --- and it's [not just gas
prices]{.underline}. You talk to people in focus groups and
[they]{.underline} will [talk about milk and bread and
cereal]{.underline}. They understand that gas prices have soared because
of the war in Ukraine, but that's not the case for food."

[There is another element]{.underline} that now threatens to affect the
direction of these elections: **[the prospect that the Supreme Court
will overturn Roe v. Wade]{.underline}**, a monumental action that would
elevate a battle over the future of abortion rights into the campaign
debates. Such a decision in the case involving Mississippi's restrictive
abortion law could cut into what is now a Republican advantage in
enthusiasm to vote in November.

[Biden]{.underline} administration officials [and Democratic candidates
will offer]{.underline} their own story as a counter to the prevailing
gloomy predictions. Their [narrative]{.underline} will highlight passage
[of]{.underline} a major **[economic stimulus package and a bipartisan
infrastructure bill]{.underline}**, the creation of roughly 8 million
jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in a half-century. [Their
story]{.underline} now also [includes confirmation of the first Black
woman to the Supreme Court]{.underline} --- a promise kept by the
president to one of his party's most loyal constituencies. Democrats
also will seek to offset their disadvantages by mobilizing voters around
abortion and other cultural issues.

GAZETTE: **[Foreign policy matters are not known to motivate
voters]{.underline}** unless American casualties are involved, but the
U.S. support for Ukraine is widely popular. [Could Ukraine be an
important issue in the midterms]{.underline}?

SEIB: [It's]{.underline}, at the moment, a **[secondary not a primary

about **economics and domestic issues first**]{.underline},
**[international issues second]{.underline}**, unless they're forced to
do otherwise, and that's what prevails right now.

frantically sound the alarm ahead of midterm elections\". Washington

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/democrats-urge-president-joe-biden-to-focus-on-inflation-economic-issues-rather-than-vladimir-putin-ahead-of-2022-midterm-elections

[There\'s]{.underline} a growing sense of [panic among]{.underline}
Washington [Democrats]{.underline} about the party\'s midterm election
prospects, [with a number of them calling on]{.underline} President Joe
[Biden to focus **more heavily on domestic problems rather than the war
in Ukraine.**]{.underline}

**[Numerous polls show voters]{.underline}** of both parties **[are
overwhelmingly focused on the economy]{.underline}** heading into
November. Biden and the White House launched the year with a pledge to
travel the country more to explain how the president\'s fiscal policies
will \"grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.\"

However, for the past two months, [Biden\'s attention has been consumed
by]{.underline} coordinating the West\'s economic pressure campaign
against **[Russia]{.underline}**. John Anzalone, Biden\'s campaign
pollster, has said publicly that [the president\'s inability to advance
his economic agenda]{.underline}, not to mention liberal social
proposals, has [forced voters into a \"**what have you done for me
lately**\" mode.]{.underline}

\"**[They don't feel Democrats can get their s\*\*\*
together]{.underline}** and get things done,\" he told Politico. \"No
one's going to sit there as a Democratic consultant and try to
bulls\*\*\* you that this is anything but a really sour environment for
Democrats.\"

Anzalone called 2022 \"the worst political environment that I've lived
through in 30 years of being a political consultant,\" maintaining that
Democrats have the \"ability\" to maintain a majority in the Senate but
could suffer catastrophic losses in the House.

\"There's a big difference between losing 7 and 10 seats in the House
and getting your ass kicked and losing 35, 40,\" he added.

White House officials, cautiously avoiding Hatch Act violations that
plagued the Trump administration, have avoided publicly weighing in on
Democrats\' midterm election hopes but argue that the administration can
\"walk and chew gum at the same time.\"

Top administration officials have spent 2022 highlighting the
president\'s legislative victories, the American Rescue Plan and
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Biden is also ramping up the national
tour he promised in January. The president traveled to a bioethanol
plant in Menlo, Iowa, on Tuesday to discuss the administration\'s
efforts to cut rising gas prices, and he visited North Carolina A&T
State University to pressure Congress to pass a competitive
manufacturing bill while simultaneously highlighting the
administration\'s support of HBCUs.

The White House has also sought to blame Russian President Vladimir
Putin and the war in Ukraine for the current inflationary run, referring
to elevated gas prices as \"Putin\'s price hike.\"

Still, polling indicates voters are much more likely to blame Democrats
and the Biden administration for historic price increases than give them
credit for adding a record number of jobs to the economy in Biden\'s
first year-plus in office. A February poll conducted by liberal firm
Navigator Research shows that 40% of the country actually believes the
economy has shed jobs under Biden\'s stewardship.

[A Democrat strategist told the Daily Mail that Democrats are also
\"losing the blame game\" on inflation.]{.underline}

\"**[No one is going to have to vote on]{.underline}** Vladimir
**[Putin]{.underline}** anytime soon,\" that person added.

[while Biden enjoyed a small rise in his approval ratings in the

(CNN)President Joe [Biden and his aides are actively working to
**refocus on**]{.underline} the litany of **[domestic
issues]{.underline}** threatening Democrats\' prospects in the midterm
elections [following]{.underline} weeks of the President\'s days being
consumed by the war in [Ukraine]{.underline}.

Since [Biden returned from]{.underline} a last-minute diplomatic outing
to [Europe last month, **he\'s held no scheduled events about Russia\'s
invasion**]{.underline} \-- a stark contrast to the previous weeks, when
the President emerged regularly to update Americans on new sanctions,
intelligence and Western military assistance.

Even as the atrocities of Bucha played out on television screens across
the world this week --- including in the West Wing, where an outraged
Biden and his team watched with horror --- there were no specific events
to address the grim footage.

Instead, **[Biden\'s focus has been squarely at home]{.underline}**.
[From]{.underline} the cost of [health care to supply chain]{.underline}
bottlenecks [to prices at the pump and a robust economic
recovery]{.underline} --- one that officials believe simply hasn\'t
broken through --- [Biden\'s public focus has lately been guided
**entirely by domestic issues**]{.underline}.

The shift comes as Biden and his team assess a concerning political
landscape complicated by the ripple effect of severe economic sanctions
imposed on Moscow. [Other recent developments]{.underline} \--
[including]{.underline} a decision to lift pandemic-era restrictions on
[the **border**]{.underline} \-- [have contributed to growing unease
among Democrats about November\'s elections. And]{.underline} a recent
surge of **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 cases among Biden\'s circle has
[acted as a reminder of the virus\' continued presence]{.underline}.

**[Biden\'s response to Russia\'s]{.underline}** invasion of Ukraine has
**[done little to boost his sagging political standing]{.underline}**,
despite generating unprecedented unity among Western allies. As the
White House settles in for what officials believe will be a prolonged
conflict, [there has been a clear effort to try and **break
through**]{.underline} wall-to-wall **[war coverage with Biden\'s
domestic priorities.]{.underline}**

\"We can do more than one thing at a time,\" [a senior administration
official told CNN. \"We have a **story to tell at home**]{.underline}
and it\'s only natural that we would focus on that as much as
possible.\"

much worse than the potential benefits could be," said Coleman.

### AT: Dems Cause Financial Regs\-\--2AC 

#### Dems [won't cause]{.underline} financial regs\-\--it's a [party fault line]{.underline}. 

**Politico 3/23/22**. \"Democrats want to crack down on Wall Street.
Guess who\'s getting in the way.\"

President Joe [Biden pledged to bring financial oversight]{.underline}
back in style after four years of rule rollbacks under Donald Trump. But
**[more than a year into Biden's first term, none of the government's
major bank regulators have Senate-confirmed leaders.]{.underline}**

Sarah Bloom [Raskin withdrew]{.underline} last week as Biden's nominee
for the top job overseeing banks at the Federal Reserve [after facing
**opposition from**]{.underline} Republicans and Sen. Joe
**[Manchin]{.underline}** (D-W.Va.). **[Moderate Democrats earlier
rejected]{.underline}** Saule **[Omarova]{.underline}**, Biden's pick to
head another bank regulator, [because she had advocated for a dominant
role for government in finance]{.underline}. The other key overseer, the
FDIC, was just taken over by an Obama appointee on an acting basis ---
though his term technically expired three years ago.

The result is that **[regulators have done little]{.underline}** to
reverse what many Democrats saw as a weakening of the guardrails around
banks during the Trump administration. [Progressive
priorities]{.underline}, like making it tougher for banks to merge or
pressing financial institutions to prepare for climate change, [are
moving slowly]{.underline}. And there's no point person on the Fed board
during an especially risky moment for the financial system as banks deal
with soaring inflation, rising interest rates and disruption caused by
the war in Ukraine.

"This is a moment, similar to what was happening in the late 1990s and
early 2000s, with tremendous technological shifts in the financial
sector," Omarova said in an interview, referring to the years leading up
to the 2008 financial crisis. "At that time, a lot of what was happening
was allowed to happen because there was not sufficiently attuned and
careful oversight."

[The administration's difficulties in getting bank cop nominees through
a Democratic-controlled Senate underscore the **fault lines within the
party over how to approach financial regulation**]{.underline}. [In
2018, fully a third of the Democratic caucus voted in favor of
**bipartisan legislation aimed in part at slashing regulations** on
regional lenders that were put in place after the financial
crisis]{.underline}, a bill that was fiercely opposed by progressive
Democrats as a giveaway to bigger banks.

### AT: Financial Regs Hurt Growth\-\--2AC 

#### Dems better for [financial stability]{.underline}\-\--key to solve [stock]{.underline} and [crypto]{.underline} nosedive\-\--08 proves. 

**RockyMount Telegram 5/20/22**. \"Editorial: Midterms looming, Dems
must act on financial regulation\". . 5-20-2022.

President [Biden]{.underline} likes to [tout his role as "Sheriff
Joe"]{.underline} in the Obama administration, where [he helped
distribute and monitor billions in recovery aid in response to the Great
Recession]{.underline}. But [another key part of the cleanup from the
2008 financial crisis was **tighter regulation of Wall Street
banks**]{.underline}. In that area, [Biden is in danger of not getting
his own sheriffs in place.]{.underline}

At the top of the list is the need to fill the role of the Federal
Reserve vice chair of supervision. This post has been vacant since Oct.
13, 2021. [If **midterm elections** go the way polling currently
predicts, Biden will have an **even tougher time**]{.underline} getting
much done with a GOP-led House and possibly Senate, too. So this is
likely Biden's last window to get his picks in place in top bank cop
positions. It's inexplicable how slowly the White House and Senate
Democrats have moved to fill these roles.

[Financial regulators]{.underline} aren't household names, but they can
[have a **massive impact** on everything from **bitcoin to bank mergers
to market stability**]{.underline}. They have wide discretion to make
regulations, largely without any additional input from Congress. The
Trump administration used regulatory channels to severely curb
immigration. [Democrats could make a similarly large impact on financial
regulation]{.underline}, but they have been slow to nominate and confirm
key appointments.

It was well known since Biden's first day in office that the Fed's
banking supervision position would be open in October 2021, yet the
White House waited until January 2022 to nominate Sarah Bloom Raskin for
the role. She was unable to garner enough Democratic votes for
confirmation and was forced to withdraw. On April 15 --- six months
after the position became vacant --- Biden nominated former Treasury
official Michael Barr for the Fed role. His confirmation hearing has
been scheduled for Thursday. Senate Democrats need to move swiftly after
that to confirm him.

[Barr was instrumental in implementing the Dodd-Frank]{.underline} Wall
Street Reform [and Consumer Protection Act]{.underline} during President
Barack Obama's first term. [He is widely seen as a moderate Democrat and
is well known in the financial industry]{.underline}. He was an acolyte
of Robert Rubin when he was Treasury secretary during the Clinton
administration. While some on the left are concerned that Barr would be
more lenient on the banks than they would like, it's clear he is
qualified for the role. In a less polarized world, he would garner
Republican votes, too.

The comptroller of the currency post also remains open after Biden's
nominee, Saule Omarova, was forced to withdraw in December after a rocky
confirmation hearing, and there's no confirmed chair of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. At both the OCC and FDIC, there are
acting heads, which, while not ideal, at least allows Biden to have some
sway over the agencies. But the Fed needs to have a confirmed person for
the role.

[At a time when **stocks are nosediving** and **various cryptocurrencies
are collapsing**]{.underline}, Biden and fellow [Democrats need to make
these appointments a more urgent priority]{.underline}. This opportunity
may not come again.

### Impact D/No Economic War\-\--2AC

#### Economic collapse doesn't cause war 

Daniel **Drezner 14**. professor of International Law at Tufts, The
System Worked: Global Economic Governance during the Great Recession,
World Politics, Volume 66. Number 1, January 2014

The final significant outcome addresses [a **dog**]{.underline} that
**[hasn\'t barked]{.underline}**: the effect of the Great Recession on
cross-border conflict and violence. [During the initial stages of the
crisis, multiple analysts asserted that the financial crisis would lead
states to increase their use of force]{.underline} as a tool for staying
in power.42 They voiced genuine concern that the global economic
downturn would lead to an increase in conflict---[whether
through]{.underline} greater internal [repression, diversionary wars,
arms races, or a ratcheting up of great power conflict]{.underline}.
Violence in the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and
even the disruptions of the Occupy movement fueled impressions of a
surge in global public disorder.

[**The aggregate data suggest otherwise**, however]{.underline}. The
Institute for Economics and Peace has concluded that \"[the average
level of peacefulness in 2012 is approximately the same as it was in
2007]{.underline}.\"43 [Interstate violence]{.underline} in particular
[has declined since the start of the financial crisis, as have military
expenditures]{.underline} in most sampled countries. Other [studies
confirm that]{.underline} [the Great Recession has not triggered any
increase in violent conflict]{.underline}, as Lotta Themner and Peter
Wallensteen conclude: \"\[T\]he pattern is one of relative stability
when we consider the trend for the past five years.\"44
[The]{.underline} secular [decline in violence that started with the end
of the Cold War has not been reversed]{.underline}. Rogers Brubaker
observes that \"**[the crisis has not]{.underline}** to date
**[generated the surge in protectionist nationalism or ethnic exclusion
that might have been expected]{.underline}**.\"45

#### No diversionary war.

Watanabe, Waseda University. \"Could Leaders Deflect from Political
Scandals? Cross-National Experiments on Diversionary Action in Israel

[The **diversionary theory of war** is one of the best-known conflict
initiation theories focusing on democratic leaders' incentives.
According to the theory]{.underline}, democratic [leaders]{.underline}
who face greater electoral challenges, either [due to]{.underline}
political scandals or an **[economic downturn]{.underline}**, are more
likely to [choose provocative foreign policies and seek to lead the
country into diplomatic crises, in hopes of inciting nationalistic
sentiments]{.underline} that will boost their approval ratings via the
so-called "rally around the flag" effect (e.g. Gaines 2002; Hetherington
and Nelson 2003; Mueller 1973).

Despite the intuitive appeal of this theory, **[empirical studies have
been largely unable to find consistent evidence to corroborate the
purported theoretical mechanisms]{.underline}**. Findings from
observational studies have been quite mixed. The fact that a
[diverse]{.underline} set of [findings]{.underline} have been reported
from observational studies [suggests that **unobservable confounders**
arising from strategic interactions greatly hinder our ability to tease
out the causal effect of electoral hardship on conflict
behaviors.]{.underline}

In this research note, we claim that **[the key assumption of the theory
does not work as expected]{.underline}**. That is, a [political leader
cannot divert attention]{.underline} from his/her political scandals [by
emphasizing a foreign threat and alerting the general public that the
country may go to war]{.underline} against an enemy. [Although the
assumptions that the threat or use of force is salient]{.underline} and
that an acute enemy threat would create a rally-around-the-flag effect
are common, [they have rarely been tested at a micro-level in an
experimental setting. Our team conducted a **cross-national
experiment**]{.underline} to find out whether and how political leaders
could divert the public's attention away from their political scandals.

#### Collapse won't cause war

Even if war is still seen as evil, the security community could be
dissolved if severe conflicts of interest were to arise. [Could the more
peaceful world generate new interests that would bring the members of
the community into sharp disputes]{.underline}?45 A zero-sum sense of
status would be one example, perhaps linked to a steep rise in
nationalism. More likely would be a worsening of the current economic
difficulties, which could itself produce greater nationalism, undermine
democracy and bring back old-fashioned beggar-myneighbor economic
policies. While these dangers are real, [**it is hard to believe that
the conflicts could be great enough to lead the members of the community
to contemplate fighting each other**. It is not so much that economic
interdependence has proceeded to the point where it could not be
reversed]{.underline} -- states that were more internally interdependent
than anything seen internationally have fought bloody civil wars.
[Rather it is that even if the more extreme versions of free trade and
economic liberalism become discredited, it is hard to see how without
building on a preexisting high level of political conflict leaders and
mass opinion would come to believe that their **countries could prosper
by impoverishing or even attacking others**]{.underline}. Is it possible
that problems will not only become severe, but that people will
entertain the thought that they have to be solved by war? While a
pessimist could note that this argument does not appear as outlandish as
it did before the financial crisis, [an optimist could reply (correctly,
in my view) that the very fact that we have seen such a sharp economic
down-turn without anyone suggesting that force of arms is the solution
shows that **even if bad times bring about greater economic conflict, it
will not make war thinkable.**]{.underline}

Rep. Eric [Swalwell]{.underline} (D-CA) [said]{.underline} Monday on
MSNBC [that Republicans choosing \"violence over voting\" gives him
pause to believe that if Republicans win the midterm elections it may be
\"the **last election\" in the United States**]{.underline}.

\"I\'m worried that if [Republicans win in the midterm elections, that
**voting as we know it in this country will be gone,\"**]{.underline}
Swalwell told MSNBC host Chris Hayes. \"[They\'re already putting as
many barriers to the ballot box as possible]{.underline} in Arizona,
Florida, Texas, Georgia. And on the other side of the finish line,
they\'re putting in place processes where they could reverse the outcome
even if we crawl through glass and run through the fire to get to the
ballot box, and [so if they are able to win the House, the damage they
could do, you know, to **permanently make it difficult to vote and just
alter the way that we participate in a democratic process could be
irreversible**]{.underline}.\"

\"**[This]{.underline}** may not be \-- as I said, this is not only the
most important election, if we don\'t get it right, it **[could be the

reverse the outcome and the electoral college]{.underline},\" Swalwell
said.

Koppelman underscored what we should all be clear about by now: that
[most of the Republican Party publicly touts the lie that]{.underline}
Donald [Trump won the 2020 election]{.underline} but that the vote was
rigged and victory stolen from him. [The Republican elected officials
who won't back Trump are being driven out]{.underline} of office by his
faithful. "[Those true believers think there is no way Trump could lose
a presidential election]{.underline}," he wrote, "and maybe that no
Republican nominee could."

[That makes the outcome of this year's **midterm elections
extraordinarily consequential**]{.underline}. [If Republicans take one
or both houses of Congress, and if Trump or another Trump-inspired
Republican runs]{.underline} for president in 2024, Koppelman added,
"**[there may be no stopping the tide]{.underline}**." These [true
believers will **see to it that the Republican nominee is declared the
winner**]{.underline} --- **[even if it takes a coup]{.underline}** to
do so. (Let's face it: [We saw that very thing attempted on Jan.

[A base for **2024**]{.underline}: [Successful midterm elections can
become a platform to prepare for a successful run against the president
in his reelection bid]{.underline}. [In 1966]{.underline}, for instance,
[Republicans gained seats in the midterm]{.underline} elections even
though Democrats retained control of the House and Senate (which, other
than when the Republicans controlled the Senate from 1981 to 1987, the
Democrats held from 1955 to 1995). Teaming up with southern Democrats,
in 1967 and 1968, [Republicans put pressure on]{.underline} President
Lyndon B. [Johnson to cut Great Society spending and to deal with the
inflationary effects of the war in Vietnam, all of which **helped
Richard Nixon win office in 1968.**]{.underline}

To be sure, strong midterm performances don\'t always have this effect.
Though Democrats were devastated when the GOP took control of Congress
in 1994, President Clinton was able to decisively defeat Senator Robert
Dole in 1996.

[In 2023, Republican control of the House or Senate would **likely help
the GOP**]{.underline}. Republican senators hoping to run for the White
House in 2024 would have new opportunities for national attention. A
Republican House or Senate could shift attention toward questions that
would benefit possible candidates who are currently serving as
governors. And [given the close alignment of Congressional Republicans
to former President Trump, **this would clearly boost his chances for
reelection.**]{.underline}
