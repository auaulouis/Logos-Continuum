5.1. "Perpetuall feare"

[Cyber security is]{.underline} often [characterised as
**fearful**]{.underline}, [with **cyber threats** being both
**permanent** and **evolving**]{.underline} (Ehrlicher, 2021), [and
cyber attacks being seen as **inevitable**]{.underline} (Pearlson et
al., 2021). The businesses in our study seemed to agree, with cyber
threat appearing to be normalised. Participants, both CISO and non-CISO,
considered these threats to be enduring and businesses needed to accept
that they would be compromised. [This implies a "perpetuall cyber
warre"]{.underline} (Stevens, 2016, p. 120). These [businesses existed
in "continuall feare"]{.underline} (Hobbes, 1985, p. 186), **[threatened
by "death]{.underline}**, poverty, or other calamity" (Hobbes, 1985, p.
169) arising from something, i.e, cyber security, that was not well
understood, even mystical,18 as "perpetuall feare, \[is\] always
accompanying mankind in the ignorance of causes" (Hobbes, 1985, p.
169-70).19 The role of the CISO may be valued as one "that can make the
Holy Water" (Hobbes, 1985, p. 692) that provides protection from fearful
things, and, therefore, is motivated to maintain the fear and dread that
underpins their value.20

Survival was clearly a concern for these businesses. [Cyber security was
positioned as a **threat**]{.underline} to viability by many of these
organisations, [with fear of]{.underline} regulatory action and
associated fines and **[reputational damage]{.underline}** in particular
being a prime concern. Such [concerns with]{.underline} viability and
**[survival]{.underline}**, arguably the primary motivation for
businesses (Beer, 1979), [are analogous with seeking to
**avoid**]{.underline} punishment that could lead to "pain, and
disability" and, ultimately, "**[death]{.underline}**" (Gert, 2001, p.
243). The punishments they sought to avoid were enacted by the larger
Leviathan of the state and, as mini-Leviathans, these businesses
cascaded this concept, instituting their own mechanisms of punishment
for their employees, as we discuss below. [Internal experts were
positioned]{.underline} by many of these organisations [as "**guards**"
that protected them against the various harms that they
faced]{.underline}. Cyber security functions were seen as assuagement
against threats to business viability and helped these businesses to
manage the uncertainty they experienced as a result of these threats and
ensure their continued survival. This allowed them to shape their future
to a certain extent, aligning with Hobbes' encouragements towards
continued attentiveness to threats (Stevens, 2016), but also provided a
resource that articulated and predicted those threats, based on both
past, and imagined future, events.

5.1.1. Permanent cyber emergency

Many of [these organisations played a role in **national cyber
security**]{.underline}, including participating in invitation-only
national security working groups. [Such fora]{.underline}, in which
government intelligence services share details of cyber threats with
specific industries, [demonstrate the role that **governments play** in
maintaining a state of **permanent cyber emergency**. They provide a
mechanism through which governments can both **maintain fear** and
**amplify it**. This could be]{.underline} achieved through
**[exaggeration or]{.underline}** even [**fabrication**, particularly
when considering the **reliance of the state Leviathan on**]{.underline}
the **[persistence of]{.underline}** this **[fear]{.underline}**.21

A [**permanent emergency** offers]{.underline} benefits as [a "**master
narrative**"]{.underline} (Smith and Sparkes, 2008, p. 18) [that can be
invoked to]{.underline} support actions taken by businesses and
individuals within that business, whether to justify investment
[or]{.underline} to [**justify restrictive controls** such as
surveillance]{.underline}, as we discuss in Section 5.3. The
[positioning]{.underline} of **[cyber security as
warfare]{.underline}**, which is a narrative repeated by both media and
governments (Stevens, 2016), [establishes that concept in the minds of
all parties to that war]{.underline}, whether attacker or attacked.
Adversaries, or even just those who disagree, will respond to the
narrative of cyber security-as-war and then treat it as such, [focusing
on attack and defence]{.underline}, rather than seeing it as anything
else, for example, as a collective problem of identifying and addressing
weaknesses that threaten all. This [could lead to]{.underline} actions
that have [**unintended consequences**, such as state purchasing, and
**hoarding**, of vulnerabilities]{.underline}, e.g. Hoeksma (2017).
Cyber security-as-collective-problem could be considered a "flattened
narrative" (Farley, 2001), with preference instead provided to the cyber
security-as-war concept which supports the maintenance of existing power
structures. [This can]{.underline} also [be considered]{.underline} as
indexing [a "**meta-narrative**"]{.underline} (Symon et al., 2014, p. 3)
[of]{.underline} existing or ['traditional' enemies]{.underline}
(Stevens, 2016), [and the "**superiority of \...the West**"]{.underline}
(Neocleous, 2008, p. 172), as suggested by the references to
(ex-)communist states22 observed in the data. [There is]{.underline} an
almost [paradoxical relevance of]{.underline} both [Foucault's
and]{.underline} von [Clausewitz's perspectives on war, with **cyber war
being**]{.underline} a "mere continuation of **[policy by other
means]{.underline}**" (von Clausewitz, 1873, p. 12) [and **cyber
politics being**]{.underline} "the continuation of **[war by other
means]{.underline}**" (Foucault, 2004, p. 15).23 Each of these also
provides economic benefits (Neocleous, 2008), as we discuss below.

[Positioning **cyber security** as an **existential
threat**]{.underline}, [as a **war** with "**apocalyptic**"]{.underline}
(Stevens, 2016, p 121) **[consequences]{.underline}**, [may]{.underline}
also [allow for **exceptionalism and deviance**]{.underline} from
existing laws, **[both national and supranational]{.underline}**. Hobbes
explicitly permitted defiance of law if motivated "by the terrour of
present death" (Hobbes, 1985, p. 345). Such [**exceptionalism** based on
**existential threat** can be observed in modern societies]{.underline},
e.g. Government, Government; USA (2001), [including in relation to
**cyber security threats**]{.underline} (Walker, 2006). References to
national security also connect with this warfare motif. [As the nation
is '**under threat**']{.underline} then there is a collective sense of
conflict and, therefore, a suggestion that everyone has to play their
part.

The [fear]{.underline} generated by these threats [propels citizens into
"the waiting arms of whoever might be ruling"]{.underline} (Chapman,
1975, p. 88). Such [fear may be a "necessity-justification"]{.underline}
(Chapman, 1975, p. 89) [for]{.underline} enduring
**[power]{.underline}**, and, as Chapman suggests, [it is
straightforward to conceive of such "justification]{.underline}
\...\[occurring\] at the state level, [as a function of]{.underline}
real or manufactured [inter-state crises]{.underline}" (Chapman, 1975,
p. 89), [particularly with]{.underline} regard to [threats that are hard
to understand]{.underline} or somewhat ephemeral in nature, **[such
as]{.underline}** those related to **[cyber security]{.underline}**. If
cyber-security threats result in fearful and bewildered citizens, those
citizens are easier to moderate. Educating citizens on, or even
communicating the existence of, cyber threats may couple "paranoia with
pacification" (Chapman, 1975, p. 90).

[Businesses that]{.underline} publicly [articulate their cyber-security
capability]{.underline}, through references to the existence of
dedicated personnel and the actions they are taking to mitigate cyber
risk, [are demonstrating]{.underline} their [strength and]{.underline}
their [readiness for war in a "calculated presentation"]{.underline}
(Foucault, 2004, p. 92). Such pronouncements, particularly in annual
reports, also serve to maintain the organisation's power by
"memorializ\[ing\]" what the organisation has achieved, arguably also
creating "an obligation" (Foucault, 2004, p. 67) for future leaders of
that organisation.

5.1.2. Cyber discourse

The collocation of certain [words]{.underline} observed in the data,
e.g. 'sophisticated' and 'threat', which are also seen [in]{.underline}
broader [cyber-security discourse]{.underline}, e.g., Noonan (2021),
[may carry "**encoded ideologies**]{.underline}" (Benwell and Stokoe,
2006, p. 113) [that]{.underline} also serve to **[maintain power
structures]{.underline}**. [References to '**nation state'** alongside
'**cyber threat'** carry an association of **war being
waged**]{.underline}, particularly [by]{.underline} previously
**[established 'enemies of the West']{.underline}**. As "packaged,
homogenized violence" (Baudrillard, 1998, p. 160), [such
references]{.underline} not only [maintain **hegemonical
power**]{.underline} (['we' are threatened by 'them' therefore we must
take action]{.underline}) [but also provides a means by which citizens
are **mollified**]{.underline}, arguably even tranqullised, as well as
driving consumption (Baudrillard, 1998), as we discuss in Section 5.3.

[Hobbes saw the importance of]{.underline} the [**Leviathan** having
control over **language**. By maintaining **discourse** that
defines]{.underline}, or repeats, [who and what are
**threats**]{.underline}, and the relative urgency of those threats,
[the state can maintain **broader narratives** of **fear**, **war**,
**friend and enemy**, **good and bad**, and **right and
wrong**]{.underline}. Such narratives in connection with cyber security
featured in our data but, in particular, the articulation of cyber
threats in moral terms was consistent. [A moral association may
strengthen the power and importance of these threats]{.underline} for
citizens [but also result in unquestioning acceptance of those
positions]{.underline}. Although morality may (arguably) be subjective
(Zimmerman, 2006),24 it may be experienced objectively in everyday life
(Hofmann et al., 2014) and, therefore, [by assigning a moral dimension
to cyber security, citizens may be **discouraged** from challenging the
'need' for **intrusive controls** associated with it]{.underline}.

The use of [specialist cyber-security language]{.underline}, which is
inaccessible to non-specialists, [provides power to those that can
understand it]{.underline}, and this power is increased when there is an
interpretation being provided. [An interpretation provides an
opportunity]{.underline}, conscious or unconscious, [to
imbue]{.underline} its **[translation with]{.underline}** other
**[meanings]{.underline}**, whether moral, political or emotional.
[**Language** is a means by which reality is]{.underline} both
**[experienced and constructed]{.underline}** (Benwell and Stokoe,
2006), [with those who have]{.underline} the [power to
interpret]{.underline} specialist or 'foreign' language also [having the
power to **construct reality**]{.underline} for their audience. [**Cyber
security** may offer a channel through which sentiments and
**beliefs**]{.underline} that are beneficial to the Leviathan [can be
**established** and **maintained**, such as those relating to '**enemy
threats**' or]{.underline} those relating to ['**security versus
privacy**']{.underline}, a questionable dualism (Neocleous, 2008) that
we discuss below.

[Cyber security]{.underline} in both academic and mass media
communication [abounds with **military tropes**]{.underline}, e.g. Bond
(2018); Corera (2017); Kanniainen (2019); Limnéll (2016)
[and]{.underline} many **[metaphors of war]{.underline}** were observed
throughout our data. [Such **militaristic references** may be motivated
by a]{.underline} desire for those who work in cyber security, most of
whom are male (Peacock and Irons, 2017),25 to cast themselves as
**[heroic]{.underline}**, a [**masculine** trait that is strongly
Hobbesian]{.underline} (Di Stefano, 1983). [The perception of **always
being 'at war'** from a cyber-security perspective, besides the
ontological 'comfort' this may provide]{.underline} Mitzen (2006),
[may]{.underline} also [be motivated by a **masculine desire
for**]{.underline} such [**valorous narratives**, demonstrating
masculinity through "metaphor, and bravado"]{.underline} (Carver, 2014,
p. 115). [Such language may]{.underline} also [be]{.underline} deeply
**[performative]{.underline}** (Butler, 2002 (1990; Carver, 2014). Cyber
security professionals may possess a distinctive and exceptional "power"
that helps form their heroic identity, namely "knowledge" and "right
method" (Di Stefano, 1983, p. 642) which represents "the requisite
special weapon of the epic hero" (Di Stefano, 1983, p. 642), and,
similar to Hobbes' self-conception as heroic, cyber-security
professionals may be "proposing a solution to a predicament that \[is\]
more masculine than human in tenor" (Di Stefano, 1983, p. 643).

#### [Securitized governmentality]{.underline} justifies [extinction]{.underline} in the name of [saving life]{.underline}. 

Michael **Dillon 96**. University of Lancaster. "Politics of Security:
Towards a Political Philosophy of Continental Thought".

The way of sharpening and focusing this thought into a precise question
is first provided, however, by referring back to Foucault; for whom
Heidegger was the philosopher. Of all recent thinkers, Foucault [was
amongst the most committed to the task of writing the history of the
present in the light of the history of philosophy as
metaphysics]{.underline}. 4 That is why, when first thinking about the
prominence of security in modern politics, I first found Foucault's mode
of questioning so stimulating. [[There was]{.underline}]{.mark}, it
seemed to me, [[a parallel]{.mark} to be drawn [between]{.mark} what he
saw the technology of [disciplinary power]{.mark}/knowledge]{.underline}
[doing to the body]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} what the principle of
[security]{.mark} does to politics]{.underline}.

What truths about the human condition, he therefore prompted me to ask,
are thought to be secreted in security? What work does securing security
do for and upon us? [What power-effects issue out of the regimes of
truth of security]{.underline}? If the truth of security compels us to
secure security, why, how and where is that grounding compulsion
grounded? [How was it that seeking [security became]{.mark} such [an
insistent and relentless (inter)national preoccupation for
humankind]{.mark}]{.underline}? What sort of project is the pursuit of
security, and how does it relate to other modern human concerns and
enterprises, such as seeking freedom and knowledge through
representative-calculative thought, technology and subjectification?
Above all, how are we to account---amongst all the manifest
contradictions of our current (inter)national [[systems of
security]{.underline}]{.mark}: which **[[incarcerate rather than
liberate; radically endanger rather than make safe; and engender fear
rather than]{.mark} create [assurance]{.mark}]{.underline}**---for that
terminal paradox of our modern (inter)national politics of security
which Foucault captured so well in the quotation that heads this
chapter. 5 [A terminal paradox which not only subverts its own predicate
of security, most spectacularly [by rendering the future of terrestrial
existence conditional]{.mark} on the strategies and
[calculations]{.mark} of]{.underline} its hybrid regime of [sovereignty
and [governmentality]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [which]{.underline} also
[[seems to furnish a new predicate of global]{.mark} life]{.underline},
a new experience in the context of which the political has to be
recovered and to which it must then address itself: [the globalisation
of politics of security in the global extension of nihilism and
technology,]{.underline} [[and the advent of]{.mark} the **real prospect
of [human]{.mark} species [extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### The alternative is [abolition]{.underline}\-\--reject [militarized framing]{.underline} that responds to threats with [violence]{.underline} for a movement of [international solidarity]{.underline}.

[People-centred solutions for peace]{.underline}

Beyond this immediate context, [action is needed to prevent **future
armed conflict** and]{.underline} threats of **[nuclear
war]{.underline}**.

[Instead of]{.underline} maintaining [opposing military alliances, all
parties should engage in **building a common, demilitarised security
strategy**]{.underline} that places cooperation and the collective
fulfilment of the needs of people and planet in the forefront of all
policies and actions. **[NATO]{.underline}**, for example, **[should be
disbanded and non-militarised]{.underline}**, non-divisive
**[alliances]{.underline}** for peace and cooperation [**should be built
instead**, with **international solidarity**]{.underline} as its
**[guiding]{.underline}** principle. [All countries should **reduce
their military spending**]{.underline} immediately, [and agree to phased
reductions]{.underline} through the implementation of Article 26 of the
UN Charter, the mandate for which should be taken from the UN Security
Council and given to the UN General Assembly.

[All countries should join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons and work urgently for the timebound **elimination of all nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}. Through the treaty's provisions for disarmament,
the [elimination of]{.underline} nucelar [weapons could be pursued
through verifiable process]{.underline} and achieved within a decade.
[The process of nuclear weapon abolition could provide a foundational
path to broader changes in the world order]{.underline}. Eliminating
nuclear weapons would help [**establish a new cooperative paradigm** in
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [and free up
resources]{.underline} help [address the climate crisis]{.underline}. It
would also help generate momentum for broader disarmament and
demilitarisation and redirection of money and human ingenuity towards
meeting human and planetary needs.

At the core of our efforts, [we must put]{.underline} the lives of
civilians and [care for the planet **above perceived military,
political, and economic interests**]{.underline}. To this end, [a
**people-centred peace** process is imperative]{.underline}. As Almut
Rochowanaski writes, "[We must apply]{.underline} the lessons of
21st-century peacebuilding to create [a peace process that is
**people-centred**]{.underline}, women-led and rights-based." [Without
this]{.underline}, "patterns of **[exclusion]{.underline}** and
victimisation **[will not be remedied]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
memories of [pain and injustice will turn into]{.underline} grievance
and **[alienation]{.underline}** lasting generations. A broad range of
[stakeholders can be heard]{.underline} and validated
[through]{.underline} proven [peacebuilding]{.underline} practices, and
can go on to build a different future for their country."

In the Ukraine context, [we echo the call of the **Ukrainian Pacificist
Movement** for]{.underline} "open, inclusive and comprehensive
negotiations on [peace]{.underline} and disarmament in the format of a
public dialogue [between all state and non-state parties]{.underline} to
the conflict with the participation of pro-peace civil society actors."
[This type of **inclusive process**]{.underline}, a process that is
**[not driven]{.underline}** or dominated [**by those who created the
crisis in the first place**, must be applied to other
contexts]{.underline}. We know that [more inclusive processes lead to
more stable peace, yet time after time, **only men with guns dictate the
terms of "peace".** These solutions invariably lead to the imposition of
**neoliberal**]{.underline} economic **[policies, gender and racial
oppressions]{.underline}** and **[inequalities, and endless
militarisation]{.underline}**.

The old ways of doing things have proven over and over again that they
do no work. [We need a **new vision of global peace**]{.underline},
[grounded in]{.underline} the intersectional [experiences of people and
the needs of the]{.underline} entire [planet]{.underline}. Creating and
achieving [that vision requires **changing who is invited to the
table**]{.underline}: [out with the]{.underline} ruling
[elites]{.underline}, who are bound to personal interests and gains,
[and in with everyone who stands to lose from conflict]{.underline}.
Land and [water protectors]{.underline}, [feminists]{.underline},
[antinuclear activists]{.underline}, [those organising for
demilitarisation]{.underline}, equality, [and care must lead the work
for peace]{.underline}, **[not the people who profit from
conflict]{.underline}**.

Abolition for transformation

[We need a **paradigm shift**]{.underline} in international relations,
[stemming from this kind of people-centred peace process. We need to
alter]{.underline} the [relations]{.underline} between United States and
Russia, but more broadly **[we need to dismantle the militarised global
order]{.underline}**, **[militarised conceptions of
security]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} the [dominance of the
**military-industrial complex**]{.underline} over world affairs. [The
hegemony of colonial-corporate extractivism must]{.underline} also [be
transformed]{.underline} --- [for the **climate**]{.underline}, for
relations with First Nations, for the protection of land, water, air,
and animals.

[An **abolitionist framing** is useful for cultivating such
transformation. Instead of investing in weapons and **preparing for
war**]{.underline}, [we must be investing]{.underline} instead [of care
for people and planet]{.underline}. **[Abolition is a tool to build a
world]{.underline}** that works **[for all, instead of]{.underline}**
just a **[few]{.underline}**. **[The abolition of war]{.underline}**,
globally, **[requires disarmament]{.underline}** and arms control,
systems for demilitarisation and reduction of military spending. But
[it]{.underline} also [requires]{.underline} building structures for
[peace]{.underline}, solidarity, cooperation, and nonviolence to
flourish. [It means replacing weapons with renewable energy, war with
diplomacy, capitalism with a redistributive]{.underline} feminist
[political economy]{.underline} that is centered on equality, social
justice, degrowth and ecological sustainability.

**[Unlearning the necessity of violence is essential]{.underline}** to
exploring what could be built in its place. [This means **turning on its
head**]{.underline} so [much of what we are taught about what's
necessary for **safety and security**]{.underline} in our world. It
means **[learning to reject violence as a solution]{.underline}** to all
problems, interrogating and challenging systems of power that assert
they exist to protect while instead they persecute and oppress.

### Framework\-\--Competing Imaginaries\-\--2NC

#### Evaluate [competing imaginaries]{.underline}\-\--the [only question]{.underline} is if our assumptions are [desirable]{.underline}. [Policy frameworks]{.underline} make [slavery]{.underline} and [extinction]{.underline} [inevitable]{.underline}.

Princeton University and Fellow of the Orfalea Center of Global Studies
at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "Global Solidarity:
Toward a Politics of Impossibility." Opening Essay for a GTI Forum.
https://greattransition.org/gti-forum/global-solidarity-falk

[We must start by **rejecting conventional foreclosures
of**]{.underline} the [**imagination**. We cannot accept that politics
is "the art of the possible" if the "**possible**" remains
**circumscribed** by]{.underline} the play of current forces of [stasis,
confining the idea of change to **policy shifts at the margin**
or]{.underline}---at the most ambitious---[**elite-driven national
revolutions**. The structures of state and **market
remain**]{.underline} essentially **[untouched]{.underline}** and
continue to run the show. [As long as these constraints are not removed,
the **Great Transition will be stymied**. The]{.underline} first
[challenge is to find effective ways to **subvert**]{.underline} and
transform these primordial **[structures]{.underline}**. Meeting this
challenge starts with **[liberating the mind from ingrained conventions
that solidify the ideological biases of modernity]{.underline}**.

If we carefully consider our own lives, we are likely to [appreciate how
many epochal public happenings had been previously deemed
"**impossible**," or only seemed possible after the fact.]{.underline} A
potent illustration of the tyranny of a status quo bias is Winston
Churchill's derisive attitude toward Gandhi during the early stages of
the rise of Indian nationalism. Dismissive of any threat to Indian
colonial rule, [Churchill described Gandhi as a "malignant subversive
fanatic"]{.underline} and "a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing
as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the
steps of the Viceregal palace." [The great British war leader displayed
his **attachment to a Western understanding of power** that had little
insight into historical circumstances vulnerable to anti-colonial
nationalism.]{.underline}

[Similar patterns of the seemingly impossible happening are evident in
contemporary history, such as the **peaceful ending of the Cold War**
followed by the collapse of the Soviet Union; the **American defeat in
the Vietnam War**]{.underline} despite overwhelming military
superiority; [China's]{.underline} half-century [rise]{.underline} from
mass impoverishment and backwardness to prime geopolitical challenger,
including threatening Western mastery of innovative technology such as
AI, G5 connectivity, robotics, and genetic engineering; [and the
**abandonment of apartheid by South Africa** in the face of **nonviolent
resistance**]{.underline} from within **[and anti-apartheid
solidarity]{.underline}** from without.

What [these examples demonstrate is that our **understanding of the
scope of the possible** has been **artificially circumscribed** in ways
that protect the interests of]{.underline} various [elites
in]{.underline} the maintenance of [the status quo]{.underline}, making
it seem reckless and futile to mount structural challenges however
justified they may be morally or bio-politically. [**Such foreclosures
of imagined futures** have been key to the protection of]{.underline}
institutions like [**slavery, discrimination, and warfare** but often
remain limited in scope to specific]{.underline} locales or [policy
areas]{.underline}. The uniqueness of the Anthropocene is to restrict
the possible to unsustainable and [dysfunctional structures]{.underline}
and modes of behavior, while [bring]{.underline}ing [to a head the
question of finding more viable ways of **organizing life**]{.underline}
on the planet and living **[together]{.underline}** in a manner that
protects future generations.

Such **[foreclosures of the imagination inflict damage]{.underline}**
both [by **shortening our temporal vision** and by **constraining our
understanding** of useful knowledge]{.underline}. Despite what science
and rationality tell us about the future, our
[leaders]{.underline}---and, indeed, most of us---[give scant practical
attention to what is needed to preserve]{.underline} and improve the
[life]{.underline} prospects for future generations. Given the scope and
depth of the challenges, responsible anthropocentrism in the
twenty-first century should incorporate a sense of urgency to temporal
axes of concern. **[We]{.underline}** now [**need a "politics of the
impossible,"** a necessary **utopianism**]{.underline} that stands [as
an avowal of the **attainability of the Great Transition**. We must
begin by **interrogating**]{.underline} the [**semantics of the
possible** as]{.underline} a cultural, political, economic, and
**[ideological construct]{.underline}** binding humanity to a system
that is increasingly bio-politically self-destructive for the species
and its natural habitat.

[Closely connected to this foreclosure]{.underline} of our temporal
vision [has been]{.underline} a scientifically conditioned
**[epistemology asserting the limits of useful knowledge]{.underline}**.
Within the most influential epistemic communities, an [Enlightenment
ideology]{.underline} prevails that **[sets boundaries
limiting]{.underline}** productive **[intellectual
inquiry]{.underline}**. The positive legacies of the Enlightenment in
grounding knowledge on scientifically verified evidence rather than
cultural superstitions and religiously guided prejudice and dogma are
real and important, but there have been costs as well. Notably, [a bias
against subjectivity discourages normative inquiry and
advocacy]{.underline}, which is dismissed as "non-scientific." The noted
Confucian scholar Tu [Wei-Ming]{.underline} has powerfully
[criticized]{.underline} the impact of what he calls "[**instrumental
rationalism**" on the capacity]{.underline} of Western civilization [to
embrace]{.underline} the value of [**empathy**, which he views as
integral to **human dignity** and **humane governance**.]{.underline}

**[We need a moral epistemology]{.underline}** to achieve responsible
anthropocentrism, exploring right and wrong, and distinguishing between
desirable and diminished futures, not as matters of opinion, but [as the
underpinnings of "normative knowledge." Universities]{.underline}, split
into specialized disciplines and privileging work within the
Enlightenment paradigm, [are]{.underline} largely [oblivious to the need
for a holistic understanding of the complexities and solidarities with
which we must grapple in order for humanity to extricate itself from
present structures]{.underline} that divide and fragment the human
experience, strangling possibilities.

It may be helpful to distinguish "the feasible," "the necessary," and
"the desirable" to further illuminate "the pursuit of the impossible."
In short, "**[the feasible]{.underline}**" [from the perspective of the
**status quo** seems incapable]{.underline}, under the best of
circumstances, [of achieving "**the necessary**" and "**the
desirable**."]{.underline} [We]{.underline} will [need to pursue "**the
desirable**" to mobilize]{.underline} the [capabilities needed to engage
effectively in realizing "**the necessary**."]{.underline}

[If existing conditions continue]{.underline}, the bio-political destiny
of [the human species seems destined for dark times]{.underline}. In the
past, before the Nuclear Age, we could ignore the future and address the
material, security, and spiritual needs of bounded communities, and
success or failure had no ramifications for larger systems. Now [we
must]{.underline} find ways to [**attend to the whole**, or the parts
will perish and likely **destroy one another in the
process**]{.underline}. St. Francis found some fitting words for such an
emancipatory path: "Start by doing what is necessary, then what is
possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible."

[Cyber-security practice is]{.underline} increasingly recognised as

[The]{.underline} application of [sociological and political viewpoints
to such practice]{.underline}, particularly in organisations,
[is]{.underline} becoming more and more [common]{.underline}, e.g.,
Burdon and Coles-Kemp (2019); Stevens (2016). In this paper, we build on
these foundations by applying a number of lenses based on the work of
Thomas Hobbes to a study of 15 Chief Information Security Officers
(CISOs) and six senior organisational stakeholders representing 18
UK-based, but predominantly multinational, businesses. [This
work]{.underline} contributes to and [extends cyber security scholarship
by considering cyber security]{.underline} within [business as a
component of **wider societal power structures**]{.underline}. First,
this research indicates that [cyber security functions]{.underline}
within businesses [serve the interests of the **state Leviathan**. This
positions those functions as indirect and]{.underline} possibly
[unwitting agents of the state, and cyber security itself as beneficial
to **the state**]{.underline} and associated
**[hegemonies]{.underline}**. Second, it shows that [cyber security
functions]{.underline} within businesses [operate as a **Hobbesian form
of control**]{.underline} within the micro-societies of
[businesses]{.underline}, who [are themselves
**mini-Leviathans**]{.underline}. Third, it provides a novel
sociological lens with which to explore cyber security within businesses
and wider societies. We consider the key contribution of this research
as being to provide a novel viewpoint on cyber-security practice that
enables greater reflexivity and reflection for practitioners, as well as
offering a pathway for future research.

5.3. [Cyber security and the Leviathan(s)]{.underline}

[It is not in the interests of a Hobbesian society to achieve
"**complete security**"]{.underline} (Arendt, 2017 (1951, p. 184).
[Both]{.underline} the relative novelty of [cyber]{.underline}-security
[threats and]{.underline} the continued emergence of [new types of such
threats]{.underline}, including the 'sophisticated' aspects thereof,
[can be viewed as "**new props from the outside**"]{.underline} (Arendt,
2017 (1951, p. 184) [that stoke the flames of the possibility of
**war**]{.underline}, particularly when attributed to nation states.
These [threats]{.underline} also [offer "new and ever-growing fields
for]{.underline} the honorable and profitable employment" (Hobson, 1900,
p. 28) of citizens,28 particularly [the bourgeoisie who are appeased by
new job opportunities, and further stimulate consumption and
growth]{.underline} (Arendt, 2017 (1951).

[In a **(post)modern world** where threats to the state are
less]{.underline} obvious or [apparent]{.underline}, i.e., [there is no
obvious invader]{.underline} on the doorstep, particularly since the end
of the Cold War, [the inclination of the **citizen towards obedience**
may be **weaker**]{.underline}. [The state may]{.underline}, therefore,
feel the [need to motivate obedience by making]{.underline} it clear
that it is still offering [protection]{.underline}, but not against
obvious invaders. Rather, [it is against]{.underline} opaque,
mysterious, and highly **[sophisticated threats]{.underline}**, from
[which the state is providing protection]{.underline}. Not only do these
[threats]{.underline} need to be explained by specialists, due to their
complexity, they also [need to be **'sold' to citizens** through
education]{.underline}. It is even conceivable that [such **teachings**
could be **contrary** to "true Philosophy"]{.underline} (Hobbes, 1985,
p. 703) [but serve the **benefit of the state**]{.underline}, as well as
securing the continued employment of the teacher (Arendt, 2006). [This
could motivate the **embellishment** of any **threats communicated**. It
may be]{.underline} more **[advantageous for the state Leviathan to have
such education]{.underline}** delivered not through a state organ but
rather [through]{.underline} another component of [society]{.underline}
such as businesses. Rather than a conscious decision taken by the
Leviathan this may be a fortuitous benefit, but one that it seeks to
encourage through, e.g., communicating the 'responsibility' that
businesses have in protecting wider society against cyber threats
(Government, 2016).

Dedicated **[cyber-security]{.underline}** functions support, [and
repeat, messages relating to a **broader security agenda**]{.underline}
(Neocleous, 2008), both among a company's employees and their customers.
There [is a **wider security industry** that "must]{.underline}Ǫ[ensure
that **security is never really achieved**]{.underline}" (Neocleous,
2008, p. 156). [This provides]{.underline} commercial
[benefits]{.underline}, as well as [supporting an **insecurity** that is
**relied on by the state** to achieve its aims]{.underline} (Neocleous,
2008), as previously noted by Arendt (2017 (1951). [If states ultimately
seek the **perpetuation of**]{.underline} (at least partial)
**[insecurity]{.underline}**, then [it may be in their interests to
**define 'security'**]{.underline} in an insecure manner, at the same
time [encouraging]{.underline} organisations and wider [society to
achieve a level of **'insecure security'**.]{.underline} Recent attempts
by governments to weaken or circumvent strong encryption, e.g. Google
(2019); Thomson (2019), some successful, e.g. Taylor (2019), can be
argued as demonstrating this desire.29 In addition, [motivating
organisations to operate a cyber-security function]{.underline} that
inures employees, who are also citizens, [to increased and intrusive
**surveillance** and **monitoring** may]{.underline} also [contribute
to]{.underline} this same "**[insecure security]{.underline}**", albeit
potentially providing associated benefits to those employees, such as
greater privacy.

### Link\-\--Democracy Promotion\-\--2NC

#### Promoting American constitutional democracy is [imperialist]{.underline}\-\--it assumes the [inevitability]{.underline} and [supremacy]{.underline} of the West.

Richard **Falk 09**. Emeritus Int'l Law @ Princeton Achieving Human
Rights p. 52-53

The transition to a regulated structure of world order is underway and
is assured unless a catastrophic breakdown occurs, due to ecological,
economic, or political collapse. That is, the Westphalian form of world
order, based on the state system, while resilient, is essentially being
displaced from above and below. It is not only the case that the main
struggle since 9/11 is being waged by a global state on the one side and
a loosely linked headless network on the other side; the impact of
multi-dimensional globalization is also making borders less important in
most respects (although more important in some-for instance, restricting
transnational migrants). And [normative developments]{.underline} [are
now]{.underline} [associated with international
accountability]{.underline} [for gross violations of human
rights]{.underline} and for the commission of such crimes as genocide,
torture, and ethnic cleansing. [Much of the literature that recognizes
this emergent global governance stresses the **inevitability of American
leadership**]{.underline}. [The mainstream debate is whether this
leadership will take a cooperative, economic form as it did in the 1990s
or move in direction of the unilateralist, coercive form]{.underline} of
the early years of the twenty-first century.36 The outcome of the
November 2004 American presidential elections, together with the impact
of the purported transfer of sovereignty to Iraq on June 30, 2004, as
well as the anti-war outcome of the 2006 congressional elections seemed
to supply a short-term answer. [The main argument being made seems
likely to be unaffected by a change in the elected
leadership]{.underline} of the United States, [although]{.underline} the
2008 [presidential elections might produce]{.underline} some [tactical
adjustments]{.underline} [associated with the high costs of]{.underline}
continuing the Iraq [War]{.underline}. [Either foreign policy path is
essentially Orientalist]{.underline} [in the sense of building a
**future world order** on the basis of **American
interests**]{.underline}, [an **American worldview**]{.underline}, [and
an **American model of constitutional democracy**]{.underline}. Neither
is sensitive, in the slightest, to the ordeal of the Palestinian people,
and [thus bitter resentments directed at the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will be kept alive,]{.underline} especially in the
Arab world. [International law will continue to play a double
role]{.underline}, f[acilitating the pretensions of the **American model
of \"democracy\"** as an expression of a commitment to the realization
of international human rights and offering opponents of this model legal
standards and principles by which to validate their anti-imperial,
antiAmerican resistance]{.underline}. In my view, [only a
**non-Orientalist reshaping of global governance** can be **beneficial
for the peoples of the world and sustainable over time**. In that
process, the de-Orientalizing of the normative order is of paramount
importance, providing positive images of accountability, participation,
and justice that do not universalize the]{.underline} mythic or
[existential realities of the American experience]{.underline} [and that
draw fully upon the creative energies and cultural worldviews of the
diverse civilizations that together constitute the world]{.underline}.
[Such expectations may presently seem utopian , but that is only because
our horizons are now **clouded by warmongering \"realists\" and global
imperialists**.]{.underline} [To dream freely of a benevolent future is
the only way to **encourage the moral and political imagination** of
people throughout the world to take responsibility for their own
future]{.underline}, [thereby repudiating in the most decisive way the
deforming impacts of Orientalism in all of its sinister
forms]{.underline}.

#### Democracy promotion assumes a [universal Western subject]{.underline}

David **Trubek and** Alvaro **Santos 06**. Trubek Law @ Wisconsin and
Santos Law @ Texas \[The New Law and Economic Development: A Critical
Appraisal eds. Trubek and Santos p. 17-18\]

False universalism [Another feature of the new critical practice is the
challenge it poses to the idea that there is **one model** of
development and thus one model for law in development]{.underline}. At
the height of the neoliberal Moment, Margaret Thatcher issued her famous
dictum that "there is no alternative" and the development agencies of
that time adopted the so-called "Washington Consensus," which preached
market fundamentalism and economic integration as the solution for all
countries. In the legal sphere, [this view led to]{.underline} what
Newton calls "[**prescriptive transplantism**" in which Western legal
models are imposed on transitional and developing
countries]{.underline}. Although Third Moment development thinking has
expanded to include issues of democracy and the social, and to recognize
the need for limited interventionism, the development [agencies still
are]{.underline} largely [committed to the idea that there is one basic
model]{.underline} that should be followed by all developing and
transition countries. While [revisionist mainstream thinkers accept the
need for **limited differences** and **sequencing** of
reforms]{.underline}, the [critics]{.underline} seek to [challenge the
continued adherence to a **basic universalism** and suggest the
possibility of alternative development paths and legal
models]{.underline}. The hegemony of the world economic order The new
critical practice questions the relationship between the legal systems
of developing and transition countries and the hegemony of the world
economic order. Although the focus of critical practice is on the
policies of the development agencies, critics recognize that their
actions are only one of many international forces that affect the legal
orders of developing and transition economies. These legal orders are
affected by trade regimes like the W orld Trade Organization (WTO) and
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), by the role played by
transnational legal actors, by cultural flows, and other factors. To the
extent that these forces constrain alternatives to a one-size-fits-all
model of capitalism, critics seek to expose their impact and question
their necessity. The possibility of contestation [Fundamental
to]{.underline} the [**critical practice** is the desire to **open
things up for challenge and contestation**]{.underline}. Contributors to
this volume believe that more equitable and fairer approaches to
development are possible. They think that [legal rules, practice,
culture, and consciousness are arenas in which false universalism and
appeal to professional expertise can be contested and alternatives
proposed]{.underline}. They all hope that this volume will encourage
such contestation. CONCLUSION The current literature reveals several
very different approaches to law and development that contrast with the
argument of this volume. The first are the "[chastened
neoliberals]{.underline}" who [think]{.underline} that [minor
adjustments]{.underline} in the neoliberal model, [plus better
implementation]{.underline} of reforms, [are all that is
needed]{.underline}. Included in that group are those [who see the
problems as]{.underline} largely [technical]{.underline}, simply
requiring better indicators and more empirical studies to perfect the
model. The second are those who think that all that we need is a turn to
a holistic view of development to fully implement the move to the social
and the embrace of policy analysis and public law formalism. [In
contrast]{.underline}, these essays suggest that the practice of [law
and development must pay close attention to issues of **distribution**,
question the alleged **neutrality of both policy analysis and public law
formalism**]{.underline}, [and explore **alternative models of
development**]{.underline} and the role law might play in advancing
them.

#### [Rule of law]{.underline} depoliticizes global life\-\--the [narrow ideological spectrum]{.underline} of legal experts eliminates [space for contestation.]{.underline} 

Duncan **Kennedy 06**. Law @ Harvard \[The New Law and Economic
Development: A Critical Appraisal eds. Trubek and Santos p. 171-173\]

[Focus on the rule of law as a development strategy fits well with a
resistance among today's center and center-left]{.underline} students
[to think of themselves as rulers, making contestable distributive
choices with real consequences]{.underline}. Partly this represents a
retreat from the cold realization that policy making breaks eggs,
imposes costs, intervenes in foreign places with a view to changing
them. [One encounters]{.underline} instead [the vague sentiment that
getting governance right, injecting the rule of law, enforcing human
rights, will]{.underline} somehow [bring a **softer gentler
development**]{.underline} graciously in its wake. Partly the resistance
to rulership arises from the intuition that political and economic
debates about what development is and how to make it happen have not
generated a technical consensus on how to bring about development. As a
result, [focus on politics or economics places the ruler in the awkward
position of having to choose in a way that will have consequences that
cannot be accurately predicted]{.underline} or guaranteed---[but will
undoubtedly make some people worse off]{.underline}. This makes people
who aspire to act from expertise uncomfortable[. The "rule of law"
promises an alternative---a domain of expertise, a program for
action---that obscures the need for distributional choices or for
clarity about how distributing things one way rather than another will,
in fact, lead to development]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [this turns
out to be a **false promise**. The focus on rights, constitutions,
government capacity, or **judicial independence**]{.underline} may all
be to the good---but without a sharp sense for how one is intending to
affect the economy, it is hard to compare building the rule of law with
leaving the economy to operate more informally, and hard to compare
building the rule of law one way with building it another. In this, [the
focus on law as a development policy shares a great deal with other
efforts to replace political and economic thinking with a general appeal
to **technical expertise**]{.underline} and ideas about best practice.
[The result]{.underline}, by default or design, [is a narrowing of the
**ideological range**. Political choices fade from view---as do choices
among different economic ideas about how development happens or what it
implies for social, political, and economic life. Where once there might
have been ideological and theoretical contestation, there
is]{.underline} a somewhat [muddy consensus]{.underline}. It need not be
this way. One could focus on law in ways that sharpened attention to
distributional choices and rendered more precise the consequences of
different economic theories of development.The choices between import
substitution and export-led growth, or between neoliberal marketbased
development and strategies of either import or export promotion, offer
the opportunity for sharp debate about economic theory and political
preferences. Even during periods of broad consensus---on import
substitution or neoliberalism---there were numerous implementation
decisions to be made that required both economic theory and political
commitment. The choices within and between regimes are made and
implemented in legal terms. In short, development strategy requires a
detailed examination of the distributional choices effected by various
legal rules and regimes to determine, as best one can, their likely
impact on growth and development. It requires that we identify the
choices that might lead to different development paths and compare them
in social, political, and economic terms---even if we lack a strong
consensus or decisive expertise about how to make them. One makes policy
to distribute---by price or administrative action---hoping to allocate
resources to their most productive, most developmentally promising, use.
It is unfortunate that there is no distributional recipe for
development, but that is our situation. There are contending ideas,
contending interests, contested theories, and complex unknowables.Not
knowing,we must decide.We might even experiment. [The law should be a
terrain for these inquiries and a site for this experimentation---not a
substitute for them]{.underline}. Building a legal regime involves
choices that distribute differently and contribute to development in
different ways. Sometimes, no doubt, increasingly formal legal rules
would be a good idea. Sometimes less governmental discretion, sometimes
more vigorous criminal enforcement, broader distribution of supply
relationships, less local preference in contracting, all might be very
helpful. But sometimes we would also expect the opposite. [The emergence
of the rule of law as a development strategy has become an unfortunate
substitute for engagement with the politics and economics of development
policy making]{.underline}.

a Future Without War\". Jacobin. 2-26-2022.
https://jacobinmag.com/2022/02/antiwar-movement-uk-ukraine-russia-nato

One lesson is this: [we must be able to **criticize our own
governments**]{.underline}. [The path to war is paved with the
**nationalist mythologies of great powers**]{.underline} and the
impunity of their leaders. [In Russia's case, this has been
on]{.underline} clear [display]{.underline} in recent days, with Putin's
hour-long lectures laying out a particularly distorted version of
history. [But it isn't only in Russia where **great powers have
mythologies** and **leaders go to war with impunity**.]{.underline}

In [Britain]{.underline}, our leaders have [invaded sovereign states
without provocation. They did in **Iraq**]{.underline} in 2003, taking
part in the killing of hundreds of thousands. The people who lied to
take us into that war faced no consequences. Their careers continued, as
did their luxurious lives, as an entire region of the world was plunged
into the depths of hell for decades. We are still living with its
consequences today, including here in Britain, whether it be the refugee
crisis or the restriction of civil liberties brought about by the "war
on terror."

But they did not only do it in Iraq. We hear very little today about
Britain's role in the NATO-led war **[in Libya]{.underline}** in 2011,
which demolished that state, left its people in the hands of warlords,
and pushed thousands to flee and drown in the Mediterranean. Nor do we
hear about Britain's complicity [in the ongoing war in **Yemen**,
conducted by our ally]{.underline} Saudi Arabia [with our
weapons]{.underline}, £17.6 billion of which have been provided by BAE
systems to the Saudis since 2015. The United Nations estimates that
377,000 Yemenis have died in that conflict.

**[These lives are not any less]{.underline}** or any more **[important
than]{.underline}** the lives of [**Ukrainians**. We should fight to
**end all of these wars**, and **all of the wars yet to
come**.]{.underline}

One thing is for certain: **[we will not end war by saying that our side
represents virtue and the other side represents evil.]{.underline}** But
[that is the **mythology** we swallow]{.underline} from our leaders and
media [in the West]{.underline} every single day. Ever since the Cold
War, [the West has framed itself as a **defender of
democracy**]{.underline} and freedom of expression [across the globe.
Liberal opinion in our home countries has repeated this ad nauseam. But
it was hardly ever true.]{.underline}

Even in Russia, when the Cold War ended and the West reigned supreme and
unchallenged across the face of the earth, [the West]{.underline} could
not and would not stand up for democracy. It [**intervened brazenly in
the 1996 Russian election** to help the fraudsters who won it for Boris
Yeltsin]{.underline}, a result [that]{.underline} in many ways [paved
the way for the Russia we see today]{.underline}.

[The world is terrified to watch]{.underline} the war in
[Ukraine]{.underline}, which has global importance because it involves
the second largest nuclear power. But [the world did not go to war with
Russian military operations]{.underline}. [[There are]{.mark} other
**[wars going on]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though not reported. [Starting
with the unauthorised UN occupation of Palestine, [the Israeli military
killed]{.mark} 219 **[Palestinians]{.mark}**, including 63 children in
May 2021 alone. There is also **[the war in Yemen]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that continues to claim lives every day and with more than 20 million
people in need of humanitarian aid, without access to water or food;
[the war **[in Myanmar]{.mark}**]{.underline}, where in a peaceful
demonstration, in March 2021, more than 500 people were murdered by the
military and it is a conflict that mobilises powerful economic
interests, especially in the United Kingdom, a country of which Myanmar
is a former colony; [the war **[in Syria]{.mark}** that has already left
500,000 people dead, half of them civilians and that the opposition to
the government receives military support from the US and European
countries.]{.underline}

In addition to these, [[there are **numerous regional
conflicts**]{.underline}]{.mark}, almost all [[financed by the **US war
industry**]{.mark} and countries like the United Kingdom and
Israel]{.underline}. The reality is that [[the world **has been in
wars** since]{.underline}]{.mark} the end of [[World War II]{.mark}.
Lists circulating on social media show that, since then, [**only the US
has declared war**, sending weapons, armoured vehicles, helicopters,
missiles and thousands of soldiers against **more than 50
countries**]{.mark} **in all parts of the world**.]{.underline}

[[The logic of war]{.mark} is]{.underline} morally [based on the idea
that it is lawful for human beings to murder]{.underline} other human
beings [to defend their own rights]{.underline}. Therefore, people,
[groups]{.underline}, collectives [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} countries
[arm themselves and the United Nations itself defends the principle of
[self-protection]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[This practice, however,
[creates a spiral of violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [If [a country
arms itself]{.mark}]{.underline} to \"feel\" safe, [[neighbouring
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[feel threatened
and]{.underline}]{.mark}, necessarily, will [[arm
themselves]{.underline}]{.mark} to protect their security. The practice
of [war]{.underline}, therefore, [is]{.underline} nefarious and
[ineffective by its own logic]{.underline}. [[The **more a country
arms**]{.mark} itself to defend itself, [the more **other**
]{.mark}**countrie[s]{.mark} will [arm]{.mark}** []{.mark}themselves
[and **insecurity will increase**, in an **endless
spiral**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Logic tells us the opposite way. **[[The way out is
disarmament]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But for that, it is necessary to
[dismantle the war industry, the main economic \"asset\"]{.underline} of
the US and Israel. In fact, [[wars have **everything to do with
capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. During World War II, the US remained
\"neutral\", if it could, building a powerful war industry and military
inputs to, so to speak, fuel the conflict. After 1945, this industry was
strengthened with the cold war and with several wars supported by US
governments, such as in Vietnam and Korea. Regrettably, common sense
indicates that if the US were to declare war on Ukraine, there would be
no surprises and the event would be within the normal range. After all,
the US government, with the connivance of the UN, is treated as a global
army, free to carry out atrocities without international reprisals.

On the other hand, despite being a nuclear power, Russia was not having
the same behaviour. The very annexation of Crimea to the Russian
Federation took place, not on its own initiative, but because of the
Ukrainian civil war after the 2014 coup. Hence, the surprise of most
people with the Russian initiative towards Ukraine. However, in this
case, [Russia chose the wrong path, because the logic that fuels this
conflict is the logic of war, where there is no right side]{.underline}.
Russia, on the grounds of self-defence, wants to impose its protection
rules on Ukraine. Ukraine, in logic of serving as an instrument of NATO
and the USA, seeks to strengthen its military and political power,
threatening Russia. More than that, in both countries, [[what
fuels]{.mark} the [conflict is]{.mark} an **[ultranationalist
sentiment]{.mark}**]{.underline} that has, as its moral basis, **[[the
denial of the other]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a phenomenon that in Ukraine
is amplified with Nazi-fascist elements.

What is certain is that the outcome of this crisis will not be promising
for humanity. Even if the conflict ends in the next few days, the trend
will be an increase in arms policy in all countries, as Germany has
already decided by tripling its military budget. Everything indicates
that other countries will follow the same path. In this moment of
enormous challenges, the worst scenario is the increase in military
tensions and the breakdown of global alliances for peace. [[The world
should be **mobilised**]{.underline}]{.mark} to face the pandemic that
costs thousands of lives daily, [to combat global warming]{.underline}
and its effects on the lives of people and the planet, [to combat the
inequalities]{.underline} that generate millions of deaths from hunger,
lack of access to water, health, sanitation, housing, work and a basic
income.

[The **W**orld **S**ocial **F**orum has always been a **privileged space
for civil society**]{.underline}, autonomously in relation to its
governments and with a perspective of universal citizenship. [[It is up
to the WSF to **stand against all wars**]{.underline}]{.mark} --
[against the wars in Ukraine, Yemen, Palestine, Syria and
Myanmar]{.underline}. [[Promote a **global internationalist movement in
defence of peace** ]{.mark}**and for a new world order**]{.underline}.
[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} global citizenship does
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} revolt against its rulers, [[escalating arms
will dominate the agenda]{.mark} for decades to come, with unimaginable
consequences. It is a very big challenge, for sure. But a necessity that
imposes itself.]{.underline}

I repeat here what I already wrote in 2012, when the Free Palestine WSF
took place in Porto Alegre: [the WSF was born with a radically
democratic path, where there are no]{.underline} institutional
[hierarchies]{.underline} that overlap the rights of people and
universal citizenship. [It was born with a methodology of dialogue and
consensus, where the most diverse and different points of view are free
to be presented, heard and criticised]{.underline}. It is not the place
of single thought or absolute truths. [[In the WSF]{.mark}, many new
[struggles arose]{.mark}, many [social subjects emerged]{.mark} from
invisibility and the horizons of human [and]{.mark} social [rights were
expanded]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It is [[this new]{.mark} political [culture]{.mark} that [can]{.mark}
offer a democratic perspective and dialogue as a **way of
[confront]{.mark}ing [conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The WSF defends
the right of peoples to self-determine, to build autonomous and
democratic states and, in the same way, believes that it is possible to
create a context of peaceful coexistence among all peoples. We place
ourselves in the field of peace building. [Global citizenship needs
peace and must mobilise to demand it.]{.underline}

It takes a good dose of solidarity and empathy to understand what is
happening right now. It is necessary to seek common points for the
conflict to end and for it to end in a respectful and dignified way for
all sides. [Defending peace is our main mission these days. I sincerely
hope that we can.]{.underline}

What is happening right now over Ukraine is bigger than Ukraine.
Tectonic [shifts in global geopolitics are taking place and Ukraine is
but one field of "play" for the heavily militarised states]{.underline}.
Gamesmanship between the United States and China is on the rise; proxy
wars, occupations and aggression, and military and economic pressure is
occuring throughout the world; extraction primarily by the global north
and exploitation of the so-called global south is rampant, exacerbating
and accelerating poverty and inequalities and environmental devestation;
[militarism]{.underline} and military spending [is on the rise
globally]{.underline}. [Approaching]{.underline} the situation in
[Ukraine without recognising this larger context is like **applying a
bandaid to a global hemorrage**. It is a piece of a much bigger puzzle:
of a **world order dictated** and **dominated by the militarised
elite.**]{.underline}

[This is a world order that sees **war as a legitimate means to an
end**. It celebrates militarised masculinities, empowering the **culture
of militarism and violence**]{.underline} as brave and noble pursuits,
while [rendering invisible the **gendered and racialised** harms of
militarism]{.underline}. It is a world order that uses a technostrategic
language to sanitise the image of war. [Think tanks and politicians,
media, and war gamers act as if **countries are chess pieces and people
are numbers**]{.underline} on a page. US government officials, for
example, have estimated that a war in Ukraine could kill 25,000 to
50,000 civilians, 5,000 to 25,000 Ukrainian military personnel, and
3,000 to 10,000 Russian soldiers. The fighting since 2014, in eastern
Ukraine it should be noted, has already killed more than 14,000 people
and displaced millions.

[Instead of seeing these people as individuals]{.underline}, whose lives
have value and meaning, who are part of families and communities, **[the
number crunchers calculate "acceptable loss"]{.underline}** and risks of
"collateral damage," and look the other way as the bodies pile up. Also
accounted for is the disruption to daily life --- the interruption of
education, of food production, of supply chains; the destruction of
hospitals, homes, markets, water and sanitation facilitations, and all
of the other critical infrastructure that people rely on to survive.
These numbers don't take into account the psychological terror of living
in conflict, of hearing bombs dropped or drones hovering overhead, of
being afraid to leave your house, of watching loved ones die. These
figures also don't take into account the environmental impacts of war,
the toxic or explosive remnants of weapons, the damage to land and water
and animals.

These [humanitarian and environmental impacts]{.underline} should be at
the forefront of all policy making decisions. Yet they [are completely
ignored by]{.underline} those talking in board rooms in capital cities
far from where the harm will be felt, deciding what choices to make for
the sake of "**[geopolitical strategy]{.underline}**" [or]{.underline}
"**[balance of power]{.underline}**".

The urgency of demilitarisation and disarmament

**[This must change]{.underline}**. [Instead of]{.underline} encouraging
the sending of **[more weapons]{.underline}** and soldiers into this
situation, instead of justifying the militarism of one side because of
the other, [we must instead strive to de-escalate this crisis through
**disarmament, demilitarisation, and diplomacy**.]{.underline}

Permanent emergency, warfare and power. [Within]{.underline} the domain
of International Relations ([IR]{.underline}), [the concept of
**permanent emergency** has been established and discussed]{.underline}
by a number of scholars, e.g. Neocleous (2008). [This refers to the
perpetuation of a **state of threat**, whereby a population's
security]{.underline}, and often its way of life, [are subject
to]{.underline}, or positioned as being subject to, various forms of
[continuing menace. This environment facilitates the establishment of
**various responses to those threats that restrict**]{.underline} the
**[freedoms]{.underline}** of citizens, **[in the name of
'security']{.underline}** (Bubandt, 2005, Neocleous, 2008), a concept
which has many parallels with Hobbes' state of nature.

In a Hobbesian society, [there is a **never-ending need** for the state
to expand its **power**]{.underline}; ["only by constantly extending its
authority]{.underline} and only through the process of power
accumulation [can it remain stable]{.underline}" (Arendt, 2017 (1951, p.
184). [If]{.underline} such a [society were to achieve "complete
security",]{.underline} then [the state's power would
crumble]{.underline} (Arendt, 2017 (1951, p. 184). [Therefore, there is
a need for the continual provision of "new props from the
outside"]{.underline} (Arendt, 2017 (1951, p. 184), [such as **novel
threats**. The "**ever-present possibility of war** guarantees the
Commonwealth]{.underline} a prospect of [permanence because it makes it
possible for the state to increase its power at the expense of other
states]{.underline}" (Arendt, 2017 (1951, p. 184-5). According to
Hobbes, "\[[i\]t is]{.underline} rationally [required to seek peace,
but]{.underline} when peace is unattainable it is rationally **[allowed
to wage war]{.underline}**" (Gert, 2001, p. 245). Arendt further
elaborates [the need for a "**never-ending accumulation of
power**]{.underline} \[as being\] [necessary for the protection of a
never-ending accumulation of capital]{.underline}" (Arendt, 2017 (1951,
p. 186) [and how this has **underpinned imperialism** and]{.underline}

Duffield's principal message here is clear and provocative: [Liberalism
proceeds on the basis that **'[Others' are the problem to be
solved]{.mark}**[. With politics]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore
[[becoming the **handmaiden of necessity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, mired
in the instrumental pursuit of power, [any form of political
[subjectivity]{.mark} that stands against]{.underline} the technical
recovery of the good [life [is]{.mark} **necessarily [rendered
dangerous]{.mark}** [for the **greater**]{.mark}]{.underline} social
**[[good]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is significant. Since
[**de-politicization** is]{.underline} said [to occur when life is being
**primed for its own betterment**]{.underline} -- that is, within the
remit of humanitarian discourses and practices -- it is possible to
offer an alternative reflection on Agamben's bare life. Bare life for
Agamben is seen to be a product of the sovereign encounter. Life, in
other words, becomes bare since it is beyond the recourse of any legal
frameworks/obligations -- hence set outside ('abandoned' in Agamben's
terms) the juridical protections that normally guarantee the subject a
place in our moral and political universe of obligation. What Duffield
implicitly suggests, however, is that [the [bare life]{.mark} of the
biopolitical encounter [is the product]{.mark}]{.underline} of a
different logic. No longer banished from the realm, [[life]{.mark} is
[denied]{.mark} its [political quality as]{.mark} the **'[bare
essentials' for]{.mark} species [survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} take
precedence. [No longer]{.underline} then [made bare in order to be
rendered inactive]{.underline} to the society it endangers, [[life is
**stripped**]{.mark} **bare [of its]{.mark} pre-existing
[values]{.mark}** [on the basis that those]{.mark}]{.underline} precise
[qualities [impede]{.mark} its potential productive
[salvation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence, while this [[life is]{.mark}
equally assumed to be **[without]{.mark} meaningful [political
quality]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- though in this instance because of
some dangerous lack of fulfilment -- [permitting the restitution in the
life of the body implies that exceptional politics are displaced by
the]{.underline} no less imperial and no less politically [charged bare
activity of **species survival**. Barely active life]{.underline}
accordingly [has not only become the privileged object of global
security governance. **[Global battle lines are]{.mark}**]{.underline}
effectively **[[drawn around]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[[hollowed-out
form]{.mark} in order [to gain mastery over]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
productive spoils of **[[global existence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[The Liberal War]{.underline}** Thesis

[[Imposing liberalism]{.mark} has often come at a price. That price has
tended to be a continuous recourse to war]{.underline}. While the
[**militarism** associated with liberal internationalization has already
received scholarly attention]{.underline} (Howard, 2008), [Foucault was
concerned]{.underline} more with [the **continuation of war** once peace
has been declared]{.underline}.4 Denouncing the illusion that 'we are
living in a world in which order and peace have been restored'
([Foucault]{.underline}, 2003: 53), he [set out to [disrupt
the]{.mark}]{.underline} neat [[distinctions
between]{.mark}]{.underline} times of
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**/military exceptionalism
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** times of
**[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**/civic normality. [War]{.underline}
accordingly now [appears to condition the type of peace that
follows]{.underline}. None have been more ambitious in mapping out this
war--peace continuum than Michael Dillon & Julian Reid (2009). Their
'liberal war' thesis provides a provocative insight into the lethality
of making live. Liberalism today, they argue, is underwritten by the
unreserved righteousness of its mission. Hence, while there may still be
populations that exist beyond the liberal pale, it is now taken that
they should be included. [With 'liberal peace']{.underline} therefore
[predicated on the]{.underline} pacification/**[elimination
of]{.underline}** all forms of political [**difference** in order that
liberalism might meet its own moral and political objectives, **[the
more peace is commanded, the more war is declared]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in order [to achieve it: 'In proclaiming peace . . . liberals are
nonetheless committed also to making war.']{.underline} This is the
'martial face of liberal power' that, contrary to the familiar
narrative, is 'directly fuelled by the universal and pacific ambitions
for which liberalism is to be admired' (Dillon & Reid, 2009: 2).
[Liberalism thus stands accused]{.underline} here [of universalizing
war]{.underline} in its pursuit of peace:

> However much liberalism abjures war, indeed finds the instrumental use
> of war, especially, a scandal, [[war has **always
> been**]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[**instrumental to**
> **liberal**]{.underline}]{.mark} as to **[[geopolitical
> thinkers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In that very attempt to
> instrumentalize, indeed universalize, [war in the pursuit of its own
> global project]{.underline} of emancipation, [the practice of liberal
> rule itself becomes profoundly shaped by war.]{.underline} However
> much it may proclaim liberal peace and freedom, its own allied
> commitment to war subverts the very peace and freedoms it proclaims
> (Dillon & Reid, 2009: 7).

While Dillon & Reid's thesis only makes veiled reference to the
ontotheological dimension, they are fully aware that its rule depends
upon a certain religiosity in the sense that [[war has]{.mark} now [been
turned into a veritable human crusade with only two possible outcomes:
'**endless war or the transformation** of other societies]{.mark} and
cultures into liberal societies and cultures']{.underline} (Dillon &
Reid, 2009: 5). Endless war is underwritten here by a new set of
problems. Unlike Clausewitzean confrontations, which at least provided
the strategic comforts of clear demarcations (them/us, war/peace,
citizen/­soldier, and so on), these [wars no longer benefit from the
possibility of]{.underline} scoring outright [victory]{.underline},
retreating, [or]{.underline} achieving a lasting negotiated
[peace]{.underline} by means of political compromise. Indeed, deprived
of the prospect of defining enmity in advance, [war itself becomes just
as complex, dynamic, adaptive and radically interconnected as the world
of which it is part.]{.underline} That is why 'any such **[[war to end
war becomes a war without end]{.underline}]{.mark}**. . . . [[The
project]{.mark} of removing war from]{.underline} the [life]{.underline}
of the species [[becomes]{.mark} a lethal]{.underline} and, in
principle, continuous and [unending process']{.underline} (Dillon &
Reid, 2009: 32). Duffield, building on from these concerns, takes this
unending scenario a stage further to suggest that since wars for
humanity are inextricably bound to the global life-chance divide, [it is
now possible to write of [a '**Global Civil War'**]{.mark} [into which
all life is]{.mark} openly [recruited]{.mark}:]{.underline}

> [Each crisis of global circulation]{.underline} . . . [marks out a
> terrain of global civil war]{.underline}, or rather a tableau of wars,
> which is fought on and between the modalities of life itself. . . .
> [What is at stake in this war is the West's ability to contain and
> manage international poverty while maintaining the ability of mass
> society to live and consume beyond its means]{.underline} (Duffield,
> 2008: 162).

Setting out civil war in these terms inevitably marks an important
departure. Not only does it illustrate how [liberalism gains its mastery
by posing fundamental questions of life and death]{.underline} -- that
is, who is to live and who can be killed -- disrupting the narrative
that ordinarily takes sovereignty to be the point of theoretical
departure, [civil [war]{.mark} now appears to be [driven by a **globally
ambitious biopolitical imperative**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see below).

[[Liberals]{.underline}]{.mark} have continuously made
[[reference]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[humanity]{.mark} in order [to
justify]{.mark} their use of [military force]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Ignatieff, 2003). [War]{.underline}, if there is to be one, [must be
for the unification of the species]{.underline}. This humanitarian
caveat is by no means out of favour. More recently it underwrites the
strategic rethink in contemporary zones of occupation, which has become
biopolitical ('hearts and minds') in everything but name (Kilcullen,
2009; Smith, 2006). While criticisms of these strategies have tended to
focus on the naive dangers associated with liberal idealism (see Gray,
2008), insufficient attention has been paid to the contested nature of
all the tactics deployed in the will to govern illiberal populations.
[Foucault returns here with renewed vigour.]{.underline} He understood
that [**forms of [war have always been aligned with]{.mark} forms of
[life]{.mark}**. Liberal wars are no exception]{.underline}. Fought in
the name of endangered humanity, [humanity itself finds its most
meaningful expression through the battles waged in its
name:]{.underline}

> At this point [we can invert Clausewitz's proposition]{.underline} and
> say that **[[politics is]{.mark} the continuation of [war by other
> means]{.mark}]{.underline}**. . . . While it is true that [political
> power]{.underline} puts an end to war and establishes or attempts to
> establish the reign of peace in civil society, it certainly [does
> not]{.underline} do so in order to [suspend]{.underline} the effects
> of [power or to neutralize the disequilibrium revealed in the last
> battle of war]{.underline} (Foucault, 2003: 15).

[What]{.underline} in other words [occurs beneath the semblance of
peace]{.underline} is far from politically settled:

> political struggles, these clashes over and with power, these
> modifications of relations of force -- the shifting balances, the
> reversals -- in a political system, all these things must be
> interpreted as a continuation of war. And they are interpreted as so
> many episodes, fragmentations, and displacements of the war itself.
> [We are always writing the history of the same war, even when we are
> writing the history of peace and its institutions]{.underline}
> (Foucault, 2003: 15).

David Miliband (2009), without perhaps knowing the full political and
philosophical implications, appears to subscribe to the value of this
approach, albeit for an altogether more committed deployment:

> NATO was born in the shadow of the Cold War, but we have all had to
> change our thinking as our troops confront insurgents rather than
> military machines like our own. The mental models of 20th century mass
> warfare are not fit for 21st century counterinsurgency. That is why my
> argument today has been about the centrality of politics. People like
> quoting Clausewitz that warfare is the continuation of politics by
> other means. . . . We need politics to become the continuation of
> warfare by other means.

Miliband's 'Foucauldian moment' should not escape us. Inverting
Clausewitz on a planetary scale -- hence promoting the collapse of all
meaningful distinctions that once held together the fixed terms of
Newtonian space (i.e. inside/outside, friend/enemy, citizen/soldier,
war/peace, and so forth), he firmly locates the conflict among the world
of peoples. [With global war therefore appearing to be an internal state
of affairs, vanquishing enemies can no longer be sanctioned for the mere
defence of things. A new moment has arrived]{.underline}, in which [the
destiny of humanity]{.underline} as a whole [is being wagered on the
success of humanity's own political strategies]{.underline}. No
coincidence, then, that authors like David Kilcullen -- a key architect
in the formulation of counter-­ insurgency strategies in Iraq and
Afghanistan, argue for a global insurgency paradigm without too much
controversy. [Viewed from the perspective of [power]{.mark}, global
insurgency is after all nothing more than the advent of a global civil
war fought for the biopolitical spoils of life]{.underline}. Giving
primacy to counterinsurgency, [it [foregrounds]{.mark} the problem of
[populations so]{.mark} that questions of [security
governance]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e. population regulation) [[become
**central to**]{.mark} **the [war]{.mark} effort**]{.underline} (RAND,
2008). Placing the managed recovery of maladjusted life into the heart
of military strategies, it insists upon a joined-up response in which
sovereign/militaristic forms of ordering are matched by
biopolitical/developmental forms of progress (Bell & Evans,
forthcoming). [[Demanding]{.underline}]{.mark} in other words [[a
planetary outlook,]{.mark} it [collapses the local into the
global]{.mark}]{.underline} so that life's radical interconnectivity
implies that absolutely nothing can be left to chance. While liberals
have therefore been at pains to offer a more humane recovery to the
overt failures of military excess in current theatres of operation,
[warfare has not in any way been removed from the species. Instead,
humanized in the name of local sensitivities, doing what is necessary
out of global species necessity now implies that [war]{.mark}
effectively **[takes place by every means]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Our
understanding of civil war is invariably recast.

Necessary Violence

Having established that [the principal task set for biopolitical
practitioners is to sort and adjudicate between the
species]{.underline}, modern societies reveal a distinct biopolitical
aporia (an irresolvable political dilemma) in the sense that making life
live -- [selecting out those ways of life that are fittest by
design]{.underline} -- inevitably writes into that very script those
lives that are retarded, backward, degenerate, wasteful and ultimately
dangerous to the social order (Bauman, 1991). [Racism]{.underline} thus
[appears here]{.underline} to be a thoroughly modern phenomenon (Deleuze
& Guattari, 2002). [This takes us to the heart of our concern with
biopolitical rationalities. When '**life itself' becomes the principal
referent** for political struggles, power necessarily concerns itself
with those **biological threats to human existence**]{.underline}
(Palladino, 2008). That is to say, [since life becomes the author of its
own (un)making, the biopolitical assay of life **necessarily portrays a
commitment to the supremacy of certain species types**: 'a race that is
portrayed as the **one true race**, the race that holds power and is
entitled to define the norm, and against those who deviate from that
norm, **against those who pose a threat to the biological
heritage'**]{.underline} (Foucault, 2003: 61). Evidently, what is at
stake here is no mere sovereign affair. Epiphenomenal tensions aside,
[racial problems occupy a **'permanent presence' within the political
order**]{.underline} (Foucault, 2003: 62). [Biopolitically
speaking]{.underline}, then, [since it is precisely through the
**internalization of threat**]{.underline} -- the constitution of the
threat that is now from the dangerous 'Others' that exist within --
[that societies reproduce]{.underline} at the level of life [the
ontological commitment to secure the subject]{.underline}, since
**[everybody is now possibly dangerous and nobody can be exempt, for
political modernity]{.underline}** to function one always has to be
capable of killing in order to go on living:

> [Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign]{.underline} who
> must be defended; [**they are waged on behalf of the existence of
> everyone**; entire populations are mobilized]{.underline} for the
> purpose of wholesale slaughter in the name of life necessity;
> massacres have become vital. . . . The principle underlying the
> tactics of battle -- that [one has to become capable of killing in
> order to go on living]{.underline} -- has become the principle that
> defines the strategy of states (Foucault, 1990: 137).

[When Foucault refers to 'killing', he is not simply referring to the
vicious act of taking another life]{.underline}: 'When I say "killing",
I obviously do not mean simply murder as such, [but also every form of
indirect murder: the fact of exposing someone to death, increasing the
risk of death]{.underline} for some people, [or, quite simply, political
death]{.underline}, expulsion, rejection and so on' (Foucault, 2003:
256). Racism makes this process of elimination possible, for it is only
through the discourse and practice of racial (dis)qualification that one
is capable of introducing 'a break in the domain of life that is under
power's control: the break between what must live and what must die'
(Foucault, 2003: 255). While killing does not need to be physically
murderous, that is not to suggest that we should lose sight of the very
real forms of political violence that do take place in the name of
species improvement. As Deleuze (1999: 76) duly noted, [when notions of
security are invoked in order to **preserve the destiny of a species**,
when the defence of society gives sanction to very real acts of violence
that are justified in terms of **species necessity**]{.underline}, that
is when the capacity to legitimate murderous political actions in all
our names and for all our sakes becomes altogether more rational,
calculated, utilitarian, hence altogether more frightening:

Global Solidarity Must Rise as the Great Transition Unfolds

**[Without global solidarity]{.underline}**, the [structural features of
the status quo will remain **too deeply entrenched** to allow a more
**cooperative**, **peaceful**, **just**, and **ecologically** mindful
world to emerge. Such a benevolent future is blocked by]{.underline} the
prevailing consciousness in government and corporate board rooms, a
paralyzing blend of ignorance, denial, **[incrementalism]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} most of all, **[an unconscious respect
for]{.underline}** and deference to fragmenting [**boundaries** that
make global solidarity seem "**impossible**"]{.underline} to achieve.
[Assuming the paralysis has been overcome]{.underline} by an enhanced
conception of the possible, **[then what?]{.underline}**

[Global solidarity would **benefit humanity functionally, ethically,
ecologically, and spiritually**. Its functional role is most immediately
obvious from a **problem-solving perspective**. Whether we consider
**vaccine diplomacy**, **climate change**, or **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}, it becomes clear that [only on the basis of
**human solidarity** will we treat **vaccines**]{.underline} in the
midst of epidemics or pandemics [as part of the **global commons**
rather than]{.underline} as a source of national diplomacy,
international **[property]{.underline}** rights, **[and]{.underline}**
pharmaceutical [**profits**. With **climate change**, whether we will
manage]{.underline} a displacement of national and financial interests
[on the basis of]{.underline} general [global well-being depends on
achieving an unprecedented level of global solidarity.]{.underline}
Similarly, [with **nuclear weapons**, will we find the courage to live
without]{.underline} such **[weaponry]{.underline}** within a security
framing that represents the well-being of people [rather than the
shortsighted hegemony of a few governments and their self-regarding
societal elites?]{.underline}

### Alt\-\--AT: Unrealistic\-\--2NC

#### Abolition [changes the parameters]{.underline} of what is [realistic]{.underline}\-\--[history proves]{.underline}.

Ray **Acheson 3/1/22**. Director of WILPF's Disarmament Programme, which
provides analysis, research, and advocacy across a range of disarmament
issues from an antimilitarist feminist perspective. Acheson represents
WILPF on the steering committees of the International Campaign to
Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, and
the International Network on Explosive Weapons. \"End war, build
peace\". . 3-1-2022. https://www.wilpf.org/end-war-build-peace/

[The value of being "unrealistic"]{.underline}

**[The abolition of]{.underline}** nuclear weapons, of
**[war]{.underline}**, of borders, of all the structures of state
violence that we can see clearly at play in this conflict [is at the
core of the demand for **real, lasting, paradigm-shifting change that we
need in the world.**]{.underline} It can feel like vast, overwhelming,
and inconceivable. But [most change is **inconceivable until we achieve
it**]{.underline}.

Even [in the midst of crisis, we need to **plant the seeds for peace**.
If the broader context of what led to war is not addressed, if the
process to achieve peace]{.underline} itself is not feminist, [does not
put human and planetary well-being at its centre, then we will be find
ourselves **right back here again**]{.underline} as we have so many
times before.

[Many will say that]{.underline} doing anything other than sending more
weapons or bolstering global militarism [is "unrealistic" as a response
to this crisis]{.underline}. But **[it is the credibility of the
militarists that must be put in question]{.underline}** in this moment,
not those working to build the structures and culture for peace,
cooperation, and well-being.

[Everyone who has ever tried to do anything progressive throughout all
of history has been accused of being **unrealistic**]{.underline}. [The
only reason change has ever been occurred in the world is because
**people ignored those criticisms and kept working**]{.underline}.
**[Change is not bestowed]{.underline}** upon us **[by benevolent
leaders. Change is compelled]{.underline}**, by people. [Being
"unrealistic" means being on the front line of change. It means helping
to **alter what people conceive of as unrealistic**, who they see as
credible to speak or act on an issue]{.underline}. And ultimately, [it
means helping to **dismantle the systems of harm and oppression and
building something better**.]{.underline}

### Alt\-\--AT: Ukraine\-\--2NC

#### Justifying [militarism]{.underline} with Ukraine [sanitizes war]{.underline}\-\--only the alt causes [true peaceful solutions]{.underline}. 

Nela Porobić **Isaković 5/9/22**. Leads WILPF's work on feminist
political economy. This work involves researching and analysing the
political economy of conflict and post-conflict reconstruction and
recovery interventions; advancing WILPF's work in this area; networking
and advocacy; and participation in feminist knowledge sharing and
dialogues. \"Holding Onto Nonviolence and Feminism in the Midst of
War\". WILPF. 5-9-2022.
https://www.wilpf.org/holding-onto-nonviolence-and-feminism-in-the-midst-of-war/

[Dedication to war, indifference to peace]{.underline}

[The doubling down on the militarisation that is piggybacking
on]{.underline} the Russian invasion of [Ukraine has led us to a point
where **war has become sanitised**]{.underline}, perhaps **[even
glorified]{.underline}**; a point where [our empathy and desire to stop
criminal and aggressive acts of Putin has become **co-opted into the
militarised and binary ways of the political and economic
elite**]{.underline}, [where the only option presented is **more
escalation, never de-escalation**]{.underline}, never dialogue and
negotiations. [It has brought us to a point where **nonviolent voices
are actively silenced** and where **peacebuilders are being dismissed,
or even worse, made into villains**.]{.underline}
