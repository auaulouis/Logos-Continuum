## Midterms Disad

### OFF

#### Republicans [winning now]{.underline}\-\--only [reviving popularity]{.underline} can save Dems.

Senate --- and how Democrats could stop them\". Vox. 4-26-2022.
https://www.vox.com/23030164/senate-2022-midterm-elections-battlegrounds

[Democrats' control of the 50-50 Senate could well be **washed away by a
red wave**]{.underline} in this fall's midterm elections.

**[Republicans appear favored to win back the Senate]{.underline}** for
two simple reasons. First, [the national environment has moved in their
favor. **Biden's approval rating is low**]{.underline}. [The GOP has
improved in generic ballot polls]{.underline} and won the governor's
seat in Virginia last November.

Second, [the Senate is already split 50-50, so a net gain of even just
one seat for Republicans would flip the chamber into their
hands.]{.underline}

**[However, Democrats do still have a way to hold on.]{.underline}** The
main thing **[they have]{.underline}** going for them is **[a decent
map]{.underline}** --- [they aren't defending any seats in states Trump
won in 2020]{.underline}, while Republicans are defending two states
Biden narrowly won. [If Democrats manage to hold their losses to a
minimum, or make up for them by defeating Republicans elsewhere, **they
could keep Senate control**]{.underline}. But [if the national
environment **keeps looking so dire for the party** and the president,
**that would be a tall order**.]{.underline}

#### The plan [flips the election]{.underline}\-\--dems [sink or swim]{.underline} on defending against [Russian attacks on democracy]{.underline}.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/politics/2022-midterm-elections-russia-ukraine-invasion/index.html

(CNN)[Russia\'s]{.underline} invasion of Ukraine [opened up a **new
front in the 2022 US midterm cycle**]{.underline}, [with America\'s role
in the conflict taking]{.underline} a [place alongside]{.underline} the
culture war clashes, economic worries and fights over pandemic [policy
that had driven the early stages of the election.]{.underline}

The global implications of the war in Europe has forced candidates in
both parties to adjust their political playbooks to account for a
rapidly evolving new issue that, at its core, has united voters in
support of aiding the Ukrainian resistance to Russian President Vladimir
Putin\'s aggression, but also underscored the rigid partisan divide that
defines modern American politics.

[For Democratic candidates who are likely to **sink or swim on public
perception of**]{.underline} President Joe **[Biden\'s]{.underline}**
job **[performance]{.underline}**, [Russia\'s war on]{.underline} a
fledgling [democracy]{.underline} on its doorstep [has presented a **new
opportunity** to derail a despairing narrative that many believe ends
with Democrats **losing both chambers of Congress**. It
could]{.underline} also potentially [advance **Biden\'s**]{.underline}
climate agenda and revive his **[poll numbers]{.underline}**.

#### Republicans are [key]{.underline} to [financial innovation]{.underline}\-\-- they [check overregulation]{.underline}.

WASHINGTON --- [The top Republican on the House Financial Services
Committee promised a **reversal of Democratic financial-policy
priorities should control of the House flip** after the 2022
elections]{.underline}.

Speaking during the American Bankers Association's annual Washington
summit on Tuesday, Rep. Patrick [McHenry]{.underline},
[R]{.underline}-N.C., [said that if Republicans win majority control of
the House in the upcoming midterm elections, they would "**unleash the
free market**" by pursuing **innovation-friendly
policies**.]{.underline}

He also said that [GOP lawmakers would seek "a lot more **oversight of
the financial regulators** than what we\'ve seen in this
Congress."]{.underline}

"What you\'ll see from Republicans on the Hill this year, and going into
the next Congress, is [we\'re going to continue to look for policy
initiatives that **unleash the free market** and enable]{.underline} you
to use **[new technology]{.underline}** and new tools to reduce the cost
of accessing credit and make it more available," McHenry said in
prepared remarks. "[Artificial intelligence, bank and third-party
partnerships, easier reporting requirements and **more innovation** will
help **everyone in this ecosystem**]{.underline} --- your customers as
well as your shareholders."

The North Carolina Republican also promised sharp scrutiny of the Biden
administration's banking regulators, arguing [the GOP would be "the
check and balance on]{.underline} the few of these **[regulators trying
to run roughshod over a whole industry]{.underline}** unchecked."

In particular, [McHenry accused]{.underline} Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau Director Rohit [**Chopra** of pursuing a "really
**scorched-earth approach**" with]{.underline} "his adoption of
[regulation]{.underline} by enforcement or intimidation."

Without mentioning specific names, [he]{.underline} also [accused the
Biden administration's nominees]{.underline} to the Federal Reserve [of
wanting to "**manipulate the financial services industry**"]{.underline}
into combating climate change. Senate Banking Republicans have boycotted
the confirmation process for the White House's Fed nominees partly
because of Sarah Bloom Raskin's views on the role of climate-risk
regulation in the financial system .

"[It will be incumbent upon **Republicans**]{.underline}, next Congress,
**[to lead the charge to expose these agencies]{.underline}** and what
they're trying to do," McHenry said.

House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine [Waters]{.underline},
[D]{.underline}-Calif., [also spoke]{.underline} during the summit on
Tuesday, where she largely reviewed the recent policy focuses of the
committee she has led since 2019, including the preservation of minority
depository institutions.

But **[in a clear contrast to McHenry's appeal to
innovation]{.underline}**, [Waters told the audience]{.underline} that
[banks should be]{.underline} extremely **[cautious]{.underline}**
before working with the cryptocurrency sector and handling digital
assets.

#### [Financial innovation]{.underline} is key to [growth]{.underline}\-\--they [multiply efficiencies]{.underline} through [every industry]{.underline}. 

Lauren **Hill 20**. Writer for Yodlee. \"Financial Innovation
Examples\". No Publication. 12-3-2020.
https://www.yodlee.com/financial-solutions/keeping-financial-innovation

[Financial innovation]{.underline} is a broad term used to describe
advances in financial technologies and systems. Innovation within the
financial services industry [allows consumers to have more ownership and
control over their financial wellness, and empower financial
institutions to **improve products**]{.underline} and services offered
to customers.

Why Is Financial Innovation Important?

The [improvement of financial instruments and financial products is
beneficial to consumers, businesses, and financial institutions
alike.]{.underline}

With better financial technologies, [financial institutions can improve
risk management]{.underline} when making lending decisions, or providing
consumers investment advice backed by market data that's updated in real
time.

[Businesses]{.underline} with stronger financial technologies [can
manage]{.underline} their corporate finances [more efficiently and
accurately]{.underline}, [and use]{.underline} payment systems with
built in [fraud protection]{.underline} services to give them greater
peace of mind their transactions are secure.

[Consumers can take more control]{.underline} over their financial
wellness when given access to superior financial technologies, and
experience better ways to manage their finances than ever before.

This betterment of the financial services for all players in the
financial industry is exactly the goal of FinTech companies. Using their
expertise in application programming interface (API) development to
create new financial tools for consumers, businesses, and financial
institutions to take advantage of, they have spearheaded the influx in
financial innovation.

What Drives Financial Innovation?

[Financial innovation is driven by]{.underline} inadequacies or
[inefficiencies in the financial market]{.underline}. These are the
problems that **[new technologies]{.underline}** or systems **[seek to
solve.]{.underline}**

In the case of behavioural finance, the study of how investors behave
and the subsequent effects on the market, human bias in investing was
exposed and has led to increasing amounts of investors using Big Data to
drive investment decisions.

**[AI and machine learning]{.underline}** powered technologies use Big
Data and natural language processing to automate processes and
[eliminate]{.underline} the human [bias]{.underline} in Financial
Innovation Examples

[There have been countless improvements to financial
technologies]{.underline} and systems in recent years. These examples of
financial innovation showcase their wide reach in creating a better
financial world for everyone.

Mobile Banking

When a gap was found in the Australian financial services market for a
financial institution that provided consumers comprehensive mobile
banking services and greater control over their money, the smartbank 86
400 was created. The bank gets its name from the number of seconds in a
day to reiterate how customers can access all of their banking services
on their phones anytime they need to.

By identifying a gap in the market, 86 400 was challenged to innovate
beyond existing services for consumers, and become Australia's first
smartbank. While looking for data aggregators to partner with to enrich
the platform with relevant financial data, 86 400 came to Envestnet \|
Yodlee for market leading data aggregation tools.

To learn more about how Envestnet \| Yodlee and 86 400 delivered an
innovative financial solution to consumers, read the full case study.

Lending Platforms

Online lenders are modernizing lending by using AI and machine learning
technologies to automate and streamline the clunky processes of
traditional lending platforms. Calculating interest rates, providing
more tailored lending options, and more accurately identifying
fraudulent borrowers to mitigate risk are all made possible thanks to
financial innovation in APIs and natural language processing.

Accounting

To help make accounting for small business owners easier, Xero was
created by providing a modernized way for small businesses to do all
things accounting. As a cloud-based accounting solution, Xero enables
small business owners with the ability to check balances, send invoices,
or keep track of businesses expenses all from their phone.

Xero is a solution aimed at small businesses accustomed to using
traditional solutions like Quickbooks for their accounting needs, and
who would appreciate an accounting solution that plays nicely with
mobile devices and tablets. Xero partnered with Envestnet \| Yodlee, a
leader in online and mobile personal finance management (PFM) solutions
for data aggregation services.

To learn more about how Envestnet \| Yodlee and Xero worked together to
innovate accounting solutions for small businesses, read the full case
study.

Payments Systems

Businesses looking for a better user experience while reducing the fraud
and fees typically associated with online payments and credit cards can
look into innovative payment solutions. Implementing the right payment
system lets business owners focus on their customers first while letting
their payment platform flag any potential fraud risks for them
automatically.

Does Financial Innovation Help Economic Growth?

**[Financial innovation drives economic growth]{.underline}** across
industries because [financial economics have **such an impact** on both
businesses and consumers. As we move towards a more **global economy**,
we see innovations in international finance impacting **economies across
the globe**.]{.underline}

[[The link between **financial crises** and]{.mark} a **[deterioration
in]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}democracy, [**[peace]{.mark} and
security** [has been highlighted by **several
studies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As noted by Matthias Goldmann, \'in
recent years, [**[more and more data]{.mark}** has become available
which [reveals]{.mark} a [correlation between]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}sovereign **[debt [crises and]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}the outbreak of **[civil [wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 225
Thomas [Piketty and]{.underline} Branko [[Milanović]{.underline}]{.mark}
have [[stressed]{.mark} the [link between **financial
crisis**]{.mark}**, inequality [and]{.mark} social
[collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 226 In addition to economic recession
and falling trade volumes, global economies are strongly affected by
chronic deflation. Historically, there is a correlation between
inflation-deflation cycles and the debt cycles: deflationary pressure
increases during peace years, and inflationary, during war years. 227
Writing for The Economist, Qian [[Liu]{.mark} has [warned]{.mark} that
the next [**economic crisis** could **cause a \'global
conflict\'**]{.mark}]{.underline}.228 [This is concerning]{.underline},
particularly [in the context of]{.underline} the current debate on [a
new \'cold war\' brewing between the US and China]{.underline}, in the
paradigm of a \'Thucydides\'s trap\'.229

The combination of [global social risks, increased]{.underline}
international [[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} due to rising
protectionism and the Covid-19 pandemic, has
[[raised]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[concerns regarding]{.mark} the risk
of [a **repetition of the 1930s** ]{.mark}**scenario**]{.underline},
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually [[led to World War
II]{.mark}.]{.underline} 230 The US \'America first\' protectionist
trade policy developed under former president Donald Trump could
reignite under Joe Biden\'s stimulus package. Under the Biden
administration, protectionism may be more targeted and subtle, but it is
not going to disappear. Furthermore, [high rates of
unemployment]{.underline}, and unconventional monetary policy measures,
including possible \'modernisation\' of the main central banks\' legal
mandates and their impact on debt cycles and inequality,
[have]{.underline} all [been cited as causes for concern]{.underline}.
231 [[**The dangerous link** between]{.mark} the **state of [the]{.mark}
global [economy and peace]{.mark}** [has]{.mark}]{.underline}, once
more, [[come to the fore]{.underline}]{.mark} -- this time as a result
of the 21st century\'s gravest health crisis. Massive stimuli by central
banks and governments, such as US\$120billion in monthly bond purchases
by the US Federal Reserve, or the \$1.9 trillion stimulus bill adopted
by US Congress (American Rescue Plan Act of 2021) awoke, in January
2021, not only hope of economic growth but also fears of rising
inflation. The US Treasury yield curve has steepened to four-year high
and, as noted by Standard & Poor\'s Global Market Intelligence Unit, \'A
steep yield curve -- when there is a large spread in interest rates
between shorter-term Treasury bonds to longer-term bonds -- often
precedes a period of economic expansion, as investors bet that a central
bank will be forced to raise rates in the future to tamp down higher
inflation\'.

### UQ\-\--Brink\-\--2NC

#### GOP will [win now]{.underline} but its [not a sure thing]{.underline}. 

Jordain **Carney 4/12/22**. \"McConnell: 'Actually possible' for GOP to
screw up midterms with 'unacceptable' candidates\". Hill. 4-12-2022.
https://thehill.com/news/senate/3265655-mcconnell-actually-possible-for-gop-to-screw-up-midterms-with-unacceptable-candidates/

Senate Minority Leader Mitch [McConnell]{.underline} (R-Ky.) on Tuesday
[said the political atmosphere is **good for Republicans heading into
the midterms**]{.underline} [but]{.underline} warned that [the party
**could**]{.underline} bungle its chances if "unacceptable" candidates
win their primaries but **[go on to lose in November]{.underline}**.

[Republicans are]{.underline} feeling [**optimistic about their
chances** to win back the Senate]{.underline}, but they face several
messy primaries that could have ramifications for the general election
map and the GOP's chances of picking up, or holding on to, a seat.

McConnell, speaking at a chamber event in Kentucky, said that [1994 had
been the best year for Republicans and that the atmosphere heading into
November "**is better than it was in 1994**."]{.underline}

"[From an atmospheric point of view, it's a **perfect storm of problems
for the Democrats**]{.underline}," McConnell said. "[How could you screw
this up? It's **actually possible**]{.underline}. And **[we've had some
experience]{.underline}** with that in the past."

"[In the Senate]{.underline}, if you look at where we have to compete in
order to get into a majority, [there are places that are
**competitive**]{.underline} in the general election. So you can't
nominate somebody who's just sort of unacceptable to a broader group of
people and win. [We had]{.underline} that [experience in 2010 and
2012]{.underline}," McConnell added.

To win back the Senate in November, [Republicans]{.underline} would
[need a net pickup of just one seat]{.underline} to tip the current
50-50 balance. Republicans are defending 21 seats, compared to
Democrats' 14, including two seats currently held by Republicans that
are in states President Biden won in 2020.

Five seats are rated by The Cook Political Report as toss-ups. Three of
those --- Nevada, Georgia and Arizona --- are currently held by
Democrats, while two --- Pennsylvania and Wisconsin --- are currently
held by Republicans. In Pennsylvania, GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring.

Meanwhile, three of the seats currently held by Republicans are ranked
as "lean" Republican: Florida, Ohio and North Carolina. In Florida, GOP
Sen. Marco Rubio is running for reelection, while Ohio and North
Carolina are open races because GOP Sens. Rob Portman and Richard Burr
are retiring.

Only one seat currently held by Democrats is ranked "lean" Democrat: New
Hampshire, where Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is running for
reelection.

Despite having to play defense on a larger swath of seats,
**[Republicans are increasingly confident about their chances of winning
back the majority]{.underline}** in November [as Biden **struggles to
rebound in polling**]{.underline} and Americans remain concerned about
inflation and the economy more broadly.

### UQ\-\--GOP Leading\-\--2NC

#### Republicans winning now.

Watching\". Intelligencer. 5-18-2022.
https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/2022-midterms-guide.html

[The primaries get into full]{.underline} swing in May, with 11 states
holding elections to nominate candidates for November. [The 2022
midterms will determine whether Democrats **retain or
lose**]{.underline} their fragile control over **[the]{.underline}**
U.S. **[Senate and House]{.underline}**, along with the balance of power
in many states holding legislative and gubernatorial contests.
[Typically the president's party loses ground in midterms]{.underline},
[particularly if]{.underline} he's as **[unpopular as]{.underline}** Joe
**[Biden]{.underline}** and the economy is troubled. [The odds are high
that **Republicans will take the House**]{.underline} and make some
state-level gains. [Democrats **may be able** to hold onto the
Senate]{.underline} thanks to a favorable landscape, [though the **size
of the likely Republican "wave" will make a lot of difference** up and
down the ballot.]{.underline}

#### Republicans leading now.

[With just over six months until the midterm elections, **Republicans
appear to have an edge over Democrats**]{.underline} as [just under 50
percent of Americans say they are **more likely to vote for the
GOP**]{.underline} in a new poll released Friday.

[The NPR/PBS]{.underline} NewsHour/[Marist poll found that 47% of
registered voters are **more likely to vote for a
Republican**]{.underline} candidate in their district if the midterms
were held today. [Approximately 44% said they would vote
Democratic]{.underline}.

**[Republicans]{.underline}** also **[saw a key advantage among
Independents]{.underline}**, with [45% of registered independent voters
saying they would vote for the GOP while 38% said they would vote for a
Democratic candidate]{.underline}.

#### Republicans have lost clearer midterms before. 

Russell **Berman 4/25/22**. \"Mitch McConnell's Nightmare Scenario\".
Atlantic. 4-25-2022.
https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/04/republicans-senate-midterm-elections/629657/

[On paper, Republicans have a prime opportunity to recapture the
Senate]{.underline} majority this fall. [They need to pick up just a
single seat]{.underline} to break the current 50--50 tie, and [the
political environment is tilting heavily in their favor]{.underline}.
President Joe [Biden's approval rating is mired in the low
40s]{.underline}, inflation is rampant, and the Democratic majority
rests on a trio of vulnerable incumbents in states---Arizona, Georgia,
and Nevada---that the president carried by fewer than 60,000 votes
combined in 2020.

[Yet the GOP may be stuck with candidates whose]{.underline} pockmarked,
and in a few cases, [scandal-filled, résumés could render them
**unelectable**]{.underline}---or at least they would have in an earlier
era. In Missouri, a state that should not be attainable for Democrats,
the Republican nominee could be Eric Greitens, a former governor who
resigned in disgrace over sexual-misconduct allegations and whose
ex-wife has accused him in court filings of abusing her, as well as
their son. The likely GOP nominee in Georgia, Herschel Walker, is a
former NFL star with his own stormy past. Former President Donald Trump
has endorsed celebrities making their first runs for office, J. D. Vance
in Ohio and Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, whose reversals on key
issues---including, in Vance's case, Trump himself---offer ripe targets
for critics on the left and the right. The lone vulnerable Republican
incumbent, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, has campaigned against
COVID-19 vaccines and has seen his popularity plummet in a state that
Biden narrowly won two years ago.

**[McConnell is well aware of the GOP's good fortunes this
year]{.underline}**---and how easily [**the party could blow it**. "How
could you screw this up?"]{.underline} the once and perhaps future
majority leader mused recently in Kentucky. "[It's **actually
possible**. And we've **had some experience with that in the
past**]{.underline}."

[Recent polling]{.underline} of the generic congressional ballot over
the cycle [shows a Real Clear Politics average of 45.8% support for
Republicans compared to 42.3% for Democrats. One would expect the
Republican congressional ballot poll average to be higher, especially
with a President in office with an abysmal **51.7%
unfavorable**]{.underline} RCP **[average]{.underline}** but [even that
small advantage translates to enough seats to take the House. Liberal
pundits are seeming to sense something big is coming.]{.underline}
MSNBC's Chuck [Todd referred to the upcoming midterm elections as being
"**bad or catastrophic**" for Democrats]{.underline}. With inflation
hitting 8.5% over the last year as of March 31st, and continuing to
rise, who can blame Americans for not being on board with the Democratic
agenda?

[Two of the nation's top political ratings forecasters, the Cook
Political Report and]{.underline} the [University of Virginia's Crystal
Ball, moved 8 and 11 competitive House races]{.underline}, respectively,
[**all in favor of Republicans**. Cook's analysis summed up the mood
most Americans are feeling today, stating "President Biden's approval
rating remains stuck at 42 percent]{.underline}, and **[if anything the
political environment has deteriorated for Democrats]{.underline}**
since January as inflation concerns have soared and Build Back Better
has stalled. [That means no Democrat in a single-digit
Biden]{.underline} (or Trump-won) [district is secure, and even some
seats Biden carried by double-digit margins in 2020 could come into play
this fall, giving the GOP surprising 'reach'
opportunities."]{.underline}

[Given all of these factors, political observers are now saying that the
**question is not if Republicans will take back Congress**]{.underline},
but the question is **[by how much?]{.underline}**

### UQ\-\--AT: Abortion/Roe Thumps\-\--2AC 

#### Our uniqueness assumes Roe\-\--it changes nothing. 

Harry **Enten 5/7/22**. CNN. \"Analysis: GOP still favored in midterms,
despite possible overturning of Roe v. Wade\". CNN. 5-7-2022.
https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/07/politics/republicans-midterms-roe-v-wade/index.html

(CNN)[The national political environment has **favored
Republicans**]{.underline} since last fall. And it has only gotten worse
for Democrats in the months since as inflation has skyrocketed and
President Joe Biden\'s approval rating has dropped.

[The recent leak of a]{.underline} draft US [Supreme Court opinion that
would overturn Roe]{.underline} v. Wade [seemed to give Democrats a
winning issue]{.underline} to rally base and swing voters in the midterm
elections. After all, most Americans support the landmark 1973 high
court decision that legalized abortion nationwide.

**[Our new]{.underline}** CNN **[poll]{.underline}** conducted by SSRS,
however, **[shows that such hopes are likely unfounded]{.underline}**.
[Republicans look like they **remain in the driver\'s
seat**]{.underline} for November because voters don\'t trust Democrats
on the all-important issue of the economy.

[The]{.underline} May 3-5 CNN [survey, conducted after the draft opinion
became public, **shows Republicans with a 49% to 42% advantage on the
generic congressional ballot**]{.underline}. If that 7-point lead held
through the election, it would be as large a win for the GOP in the
national House vote as it was in 2010 \-- when Republicans regained the
House majority and ended up with 242 seats out of 435.

More to the point, it\'s the widest edge for Republicans on the generic
ballot in a CNN poll this entire cycle. Just before the draft opinion
leaked, an April 28-May 1 CNN poll gave Republicans 45% and Democrats
44% on the generic ballot question. A CNN survey conducted from January
to February put Republicans at 44% and Democrats at 43%.

It would be a mistake, at this point, to interpret these results as
Republicans benefiting from a potential Supreme Court overturning of Roe
v. Wade. Polls shift all the time for many reasons, and my guess is this
is just statistical noise.

But [it definitely does seem]{.underline}, at this time, [that the news
of the draft abortion opinion **hasn\'t shifted voters toward
Democrats**.]{.underline}

#### Pundits [overemphasize]{.underline} Roe. 

Charlie **Cook 5/12/22**. \"Are We Overestimating Roe's Impact on
Politics?\". Cook Political Report. 5-12-2022.
https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/are-we-overestimating-roes-impact-politics

[Everyone has their own take on what impact]{.underline} a reversal of
[Roe]{.underline} v. Wade [will have on November's midterm
elections]{.underline}. Here's mine: [To the extent that overturning
the]{.underline} 49-year old [decision benefits Democrats at
all]{.underline}, **[it won't be nearly enough]{.underline}** to make up
for the substantial headwinds they were already facing. In short, **[it
will help out less than they hope and far less than they
need.]{.underline}**

[Why]{.underline} would it not have quite the impact that Democrats pray
it will have---and many in the media seem convinced it will have?

First, [public opinion is]{.underline} considerably **[more
nuanced]{.underline}** than many seem to think. Obviously, the precise
wording of questions asked is important, so it is good to look at more
than one set of results.

[Anyone else sick and tired of hearing so-called political experts
predict that Democrats are going to lose badly in]{.underline} this

President Joe Biden's first year, 6.6 million new jobs were reported,
the strongest first year of job gains of any president since our
government began collecting such data in 1939. Nor does it appear to
matter that unemployment is down from 6.7 percent in former President
Donald Trump's last full month in office to 3.8 percent and that wages
are up 5 percent over the past year.

[Pundits tell us it's an **"ironclad" rule**]{.underline} --- as

congressional seats in midterm elections. Hence, headlines that predict
Democrats will lose this November in a "wipeout" and a "bloodbath." [If
you listen to these people, you might be tempted to **cancel the 2022
election and simply crown the GOP the winners of the House
and**]{.underline} the **[Senate]{.underline}**.

**[Democrats should be concerned]{.underline}** going into November.
[They hold only a nine-seat margin in the House, and the Senate is
divided 50-50]{.underline}, with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as
a tie-breaking vote. **[However]{.underline}**, there are multiple signs
that tell us **[Democrats could]{.underline}** not only
**[hold]{.underline}** on to **[the House]{.underline}** but
[even]{.underline} **[pick up]{.underline}** a few **[Senate
seats]{.underline}** given that there is an open Senate seat in
Pennsylvania and a vulnerable GOP incumbent in Wisconsin, both states
Biden won in 2020.

For starters, while Biden won the White House in 2020, Democrats lost 13
seats in the House. That wasn't good for the party, obviously, but for
2022 purposes, it means the most vulnerable Democrats are already gone.
On the flip side, not a single Republican incumbent in the House lost in
2018. Good luck with GOP pulling that trick twice and not losing even
one of the 213 House seats they currently hold in 2022. For example, in
New York, the recently finalized congressional map that reflects the
2020 census data is expected to result in Democrats picking up three
current Republican seats in November.

Plus, history tells us [that there have been two times in the modern era
that a president's party gained seats during midterm
elections]{.underline} ---and the [circumstances that led to those
victories apply to 2022 in varying degrees.]{.underline} In 1998, with
**[Bill Clinton]{.underline}** in the White House, Democrats **[gained
five House seats]{.underline}**. How did Democrats buck history? GOP
arrogance and overreach. The House GOP, led by then-Speaker Newt
Gingrich, impeached Clinton for lying about his affair with an intern,
Monica Lewinsky. But as midterm exit polls found, two thirds of voters
didn't think Clinton --- who was leading a strong economy --- should
have been impeached, and they cast their votes accordingly.

[Today's GOP is]{.underline} even more [arrogant and
heavy-handed]{.underline} than Gingrich's GOP was. Consider the Texas
law that bans abortion after six weeks and forces a woman who is raped
to carry her rapist's fetus to term. That abomination of a law is being
copied by numerous Republican-controlled states despite the fact that 65
percent of Americans believe the Supreme Court should uphold its
landmark Roe v. Wade decision and only 29 percent support the Supreme
Court striking down the constitutional right to abortion access. The
Republicans don't care what a majority of Americans think; they only
care about imposing their extreme religious beliefs upon the rest of us.

Ditto for the party's overreach by banning books and what they wrongly
call critical race theory (CRT). Americans are becoming increasingly
aware that so-called CRT bans are racist laws designed to prevent
teachers from sharing the history of Black achievement and Black
suffering at the hands of white bigots. Look at Virginia where
Republican Glenn Youngkin won the governor's race in 2021 based in part
on his attacks on CRT. A recent poll found that 57 percent of Virginians
oppose banning CRT and only 37 percent support it. That finding helps
explain why Youngkin, who won in November with 51 percent of the vote,
is already underwater with a 41 percent approval rating.

With only a few exceptions, these extreme abortion bans, bans on books
and CRT, and voter suppression efforts in 19 states are embraced by
Republicans nationwide. To animate their own voters, Democrats can and
should use the GOP's tyranny against them in 2022.

[The second time in recent history that a president's party picked up
seats during a midterm election was 2002]{.underline}, the year after
the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when President George W. Bush was in the
White House with a sky-high approval rating and Republicans gained eight
House seats and two in the Senate.

[**More than half of Americans** are worried about **Russian
interference in the 2022 midterm**]{.underline} elections, according to
a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.

The poll released on Tuesday found that **[52% of Americans were
worried]{.underline}** about Russian misinformation on the internet
negatively affecting the 2022 midterm elections. [The same percentage of
Americans also fear that Russia will send illicit financial support to
some American politicians.]{.underline}

[American fear of Russian interference]{.underline} in elections [has
been **elevated since**]{.underline} the **[2016]{.underline}**
presidential elections, when the Russian organization, the Internet
Research Agency, created thousands of fake social media accounts to
promote Russian political aims in the elections. [In]{.underline} a
[2020]{.underline} Pew survey, [three-quarters of Americans said they
thought it was somewhat or very likely that Russia or other foreign
governments would attempt to influence the 2020 presidential
election]{.underline}.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll delved into several other American concerns,
regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its impact on Americans.
Sixty-nine percent of Americans said they were worried about fuel and
gas prices but 8 in 10 said that the United States should not buy oil or
gas from Russia during the conflict, even if it causes gas prices to
increase. Additionally, more than three quarters of Americans said both
that the United States should put further economic sanctions on Russia
and send weapons to Ukraine.

[American perceptions of how]{.underline} President Joe [Biden is
handling Russia remain]{.underline} virtually unchanged from last month
-- [38%]{.underline} of Americans approved of Biden's handling of the
crisis in March and 38% approve in April. [A little over
**three-quarters of Americans** said they were more likely to support a
candidate who **helped Ukraine**]{.underline} with military aid.
Seventy-eight percent said they were more likely to support a candidate
who supports Ukrainian refugees. A similar percentage -- 74% of
Americans -- said they favored the United States taking in refugees.

[A majority of American voters]{.underline} in a new Reuters-Ipsos poll
say they [are concerned about **Russia's potential influence on the 2022
midterm elections**.]{.underline}

The poll found that [52 percent of respondents are concerned about
Russian misinformation]{.underline} and propaganda online and Moscow
indirectly giving money to campaigns.

Russia is known for trying to interfere with the elections of Western
countries, including the U.S.

[Concerns of Russian interference spiked in the wake of its 2016
meddling, which included both misinformation efforts and the hacking of
American political groups.]{.underline}

Relations between Washington and Moscow have soured significantly in
recent months over Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked
invasion of Ukraine.

The U.S. has provided billions of dollars in aid and weapons to Ukraine
to help them fight off Russian forces.

Russia has condemned the U.S.'s actions and sanctioned more than 100
U.S. lawmakers and leaders as a result.

**[A vast majority of Americans]{.underline}** in the poll **[said they
are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports sanctions against
Russia]{.underline}** and aid to Ukraine and its refugees.

The poll was conducted between April 25 and April 26 among 1,005 adults.

[Russia's]{.underline} deadly [invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine [could
throw a wrench into the **midterms as voters scrutinize**]{.underline}
President **[Biden's efforts to counter aggression from a global
superpower]{.underline}** and U.S. adversary.

Foreign policy rarely touches down-ballot elections. But **[Russia's
moves]{.underline}** in Europe, **[and the U.S.'s response, could have
domestic implications]{.underline}** that hit Americans' pocketbooks and
would come on top of already high gas prices and record inflation ---
issues voters rank among the most important.

Additionally, [deep networks of immigrants from Eastern Europe reside
in]{.underline} some of the nation's most **[critical battleground
states]{.underline}**, and [the president's approval rating, a predictor
of]{.underline} his party's [midterm performance, remains
low]{.underline}.

"**[This is]{.underline}** going to be **[a backdrop to a lot of the
elections]{.underline}** now," said Dave Pepper, the former chair of the
state Democratic Party in Ohio, a key swing state with the country's
fifth-highest population of Ukrainian residents.

Some Democrats believe [Biden is well-positioned to explain his
decisions]{.underline} on Ukraine and defend the increasingly severe
sanctions he is levying against Moscow. The president this week called
Russia's invasion a "brutal assault on the people of Ukraine" and a
"premeditated attack." He placed new economic and technology sanctions
on the country on Thursday, and officials said they still have options
on the table.

Pepper speculated that **[Biden's posture on the crisis]{.underline}**
--- and the isolationist response from some GOP candidates --- [**could
create an opening for down-ballot Democrats** in November's
elections]{.underline}.

Ohio Republican Senate candidates Josh Mandel and J.D. Vance have
questioned why the U.S. is focused on the foreign conflict while
domestic issues mount. Vance went as far to say on a right-wing podcast
that he doesn't "really care what happens to Ukraine one way or
another," before walking back the statement.

Other Ohio GOP contenders, including Jane Timken, Mike Gibbons and Matt
Dolan, have called for economic retaliation against Russia. All the
candidates have condemned Biden's handling of the situation.

"I wasn't really thinking about the race in this way, but all of a
sudden my own heritage is relevant in how I vote," Pepper said,
referring to how Midwest residents who have a connection to Eastern
Europe may perceive the crisis.

He added, "It does add a wrinkle."

[Biden and aligned Democrats are **desperate**]{.underline} to avoid a
repeat of the chaotic U.S. pullout from Afghanistan last year, for which
the president still receives criticism --- and which Republicans have
claimed gave Russian President Vladimir Putin the green light to move on
Ukraine.

While Democrats denounce the conservatives aligned with former President
Trump, who praised Putin during his term in office and in statements
last week, many are fretting about how the geopolitical realities of the
invasion could hit working populations in the U.S. over the next eight
months.

Recent polling shows **[Americans' faith in Biden's ability to handle
the situation is low]{.underline}**. A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll survey
obtained by The Hill on Friday found 37 percent of Americans said they
were confident in the administration's ability to effectively counter
Russia, while 63 percent said they were not confident. The same poll
found Biden's approval rating at a record low 38 percent.

"[Voters believe **the Biden administration can and should do
more**]{.underline} to protect Ukraine," said Dritan Nesho, co-director
of the poll. "They see the sanctions so far as too weak and ultimately
ineffective, and **[a majority say the United States should
defend]{.underline}** Ukraine **[in case of a full Russian
invasion]{.underline}** --- including a majority of Democrats[. A
stronger posture appears to be]{.underline} both the right policy and
**[good politics]{.underline}** for the administration."

https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2022-03-11/politics-war-ukraine-scrambles-plans-2022-midterm-election-essential-politics

[The domestic political impact of]{.underline} the war in
[Ukraine]{.underline} --- now in its third week --- has
**[scrambled]{.underline}** the two parties' **[strategies going
into]{.underline}** this year's **[midterm elections]{.underline}**.
Both have started to maneuver for advantage.

No one knows whether either side will benefit come November --- [a lot
depends on how voters end up **perceiving the**]{.underline} war's
**[course]{.underline}**.

But [for]{.underline} President **[Biden and the
Democrats]{.underline}**, who have been tracking toward a significant
defeat, [attention to a foreign crisis could **provide a**]{.underline}
badly needed **[shakeup of the campaign debate]{.underline}**.

An overwhelming issue

"[As a general rule, Americans don't vote on foreign policy]{.underline}
unless American men and women are dying in a war, [but we've rarely had
an international event not involving the United States directly that has
so **totally consumed our news and attention** as the **Russian
invasion**]{.underline} of Ukraine," said Republican pollster and
strategist Whit Ayres.

"[This war has become symbolic for the **survival of democratic
regimes**]{.underline} against authoritarian dictatorships," Ayres
added. "[That symbolism has given it a much broader
meaning]{.underline}."

A poll this week by Navigator Research, a Democratic firm, found that
[37% of American voters said they were "very closely"
following]{.underline} news from Ukraine, [and nearly 8 in 10 said they
were following it at least somewhat closely --- high numbers for a
foreign issue.]{.underline}

**[National security and foreign policy]{.underline}** had **[jumped to
the top of American concerns]{.underline}**, tied with jobs and the
economy, **[displacing]{.underline}** worries about the **[coronavirus
and inflation]{.underline}**, the poll found.

Amid that intense focus, [Americans have clearly picked a
side]{.underline} --- **[overwhelmingly favoring the
Ukrainians]{.underline}**. That could be seen in Wednesday's House vote
to suspend oil imports from Russia, which passed 414-17 with just two of
the chamber's most left-wing Democrats, Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri and
Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and 15 right-wing Republicans voting no.

That level of [attention]{.underline} makes the Ukraine war the kind of
event that [could significantly shift U.S. politics]{.underline}.

"Politics isn't the most important thing right now," said Democratic
strategist Steve Schale, chief executive of the pro-Biden super-pac
Unite the Country.

But, he added, since 1992, "the only two midterm elections that were not
absolute debacles for the incumbent president's party were held during a
window where there was something significant in the country that
reshaped the conversation."

Those two were 1998, when voters rejected Republican efforts to impeach
President Clinton and Democrats gained four seats, and 2002, when
Republicans under President George W. Bush gained seats in the aftermath
of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

[Biden and the Democrats have a long way to go to emulate]{.underline}
the **[midterm successes]{.underline}** those two presidents
enjoyed[.]{.underline} A new Wall Street Journal [poll]{.underline}
released Friday [continues to show **Democrats trailing the
GOP**]{.underline} as the party voters say they expect to back in
November.

[But]{.underline} polls have also shown an uptick in voters' assessments
of how Biden is doing his job. The change is just a few percentage
points, but after nine months of nearly steady decline, it's a welcome
sign for the president.

[Ukraine has clearly contributed to the **boost in Biden's
ratings**]{.underline}. A poll by Morning Consult for Politico found
this week, for example, that by 46% to 42%, voters approved of Biden's
response to the crisis.

Voters' assessments of how Biden has dealt with Ukraine have improved
notably since last month and are also significantly higher than how they
assess his presidency overall.

The shift comes primarily from Democrats and independents; Republicans
mostly remain highly critical of Biden. The Navigator poll, however, did
identify a slice of Republicans, mostly moderately conservative men, who
approve of Biden on Ukraine even as they disapprove of his performance
otherwise.

In any case, [winning back **wavering partisans** and **independent
voters** is]{.underline} a **[key]{.underline}** task for Biden right
now, one that could be [critical in the small number of **swing House
districts and Senate elections** in which the midterms will be **most
intensely contested**.]{.underline}

[If voters]{.underline} continue to [approve of Biden's response, it
could help with one of his **key problems**]{.underline} --- [the
perception by many Americans that he's not a strong leader.]{.underline}

#### Foreign affairs will [determine vote]{.underline}.

https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/sagging-global-economy-burdens-biden-ahead-of-us-midterm-elections-122051900013_1.html

What\'s clear is that [**foreign affairs and geopolitics** have returned
as issues that could **shape the opinions of U.S. voters.**]{.underline}

Even [as the midterm races intensify, Biden is **devoting his time
to**]{.underline} other world leaders and not just Russian President
Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}** and his attack on Ukraine. Biden\'s
trip to South Korea and Japan follows recent meetings with the heads of
Italy, Greece and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations. He is also meeting with the leaders of Finland and Sweden, who
are seeking NATO membership, before he departs for Asia.

Yes, **[geopolitics will matter for U.S. elections again]{.underline}**,
[said]{.underline} Doug Elmendorf, [dean of Harvard University\'s
Kennedy School of Government]{.underline} and a former director of the

potent, China is not becoming that much like us, and **[Putin has gone

### Internal Link\-\--Financial Regulation Bad\-\--2NC 

#### Overregulation collapses the [economy]{.underline} and [innovation]{.underline}. 

Thomas **Pollack 18**. Partner in the capital markets practice at Paul
Hastings, an international law firm. \"US risks losing market leadership
thanks to overregulation\". Hill. 5-13-2018.
https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/387467-us-risks-losing-market-leadership-due-to-overregulation/

But another critical reason is that [**U.S. regulation** that was
intended to improve and stabilize the capital markets has had the
**opposite effect.**]{.underline}

{mosads}[It]{.underline} has [caused a dramatic decline in the number of
U.S. public companies and the number of U.S. companies going
public]{.underline}, and a dramatic increase in the average time between
formation and an IPO (from seven to 10 years). Simply put, **[the U.S.
risks losing market leadership through overregulation and a lack of
innovation]{.underline}**.

Thirty years ago, a company could do a cost-effective IPO for \$6-8
million. Today, unless a company is raising at least \$100 million with
a market cap of around \$300 million, an IPO generally does not make
sense. The reasons for this include the continued institutionalization
of the investor base, growing regulation of public companies and the
increased litigation and administrative costs for issuers.

Good regulation should be driven by the need to fix poor practice or
systemic flaws --- and be clear and proportionate. In the case of
Sarbanes-Oxley, regulations that sought to improve internal accounting
and disclosure controls post-Enron were clearly warranted.

In other cases, regulations directed at social engineering, such as "say
on pay," are not essential to a financial understanding of, and
investment decision in, a business. In addition, Dodd-Frank, with its
thousands of pages of initial law, and an equivalent amount of
regulation, is a perfect example of the reverse.

Many have argued that all that was needed was the reinstatement of
Glass-Steagall and to ensure greater diversity among banks by building a
system where no bank was too big to fail.

The consequence of ill-considered regulation is that there are only
about 5,000 U.S. public companies today, down from over 10,000 in 1980.
Not coincidently, there are less than 5,000 banks today, down from over
13,000 in 1980.

In fact, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has issued
only seven new bank charters since 2009; in four of those years, no bank
charters at all were issued. Vibrant local economies need locally
knowledgeable banks.

[The declining number of public companies increases securities
litigation risks. With a declining number of companies to pursue, the
plaintiffs' bar has filed complaints against ever smaller securities law
infractions]{.underline}, even if not material. More plaintiffs' lawyers
focused on fewer companies is never a good result for shareholders.

[Today's economy is being reshaped by technology and digitization, but
current securities regulation is not aligned with it, **nor does it
support the robust capital markets that underpin innovation and capital
formation**.]{.underline}

To date, the SEC has responded to changes in the economy by introducing
more and more amending regulations, carving out niches from the overall
monolith of the Securities Act of 1933. This has made the act overly
complex because companies must understand when regulations apply to them
and when they do not.

The **[securities laws need to be rewritten]{.underline}** from scratch
to reflect the reality of today's investment world. U.S. markets should
not only compete with other international capital markets, **[they
should promote U.S. innovation and business growth.]{.underline}**

Disclosures should focus on information that is material to today's
investors, avoid social engineering and be available through different
media, including webcasts. Investors today do not focus on three years'
worth of comparative financial results --- business is moving too fast
for that.

They want to know what is happening now and in the future, and they want
the disclosures to be made to them through streaming media. There should
be a simple set of regulations for companies whose market capitalization
is under \$100 million and another set for larger companies.

Ultimately, the securities laws that underpin processes like IPOs should
prime the economy for the benefit of all stakeholders --- including the
issuers themselves, institutional and retail investors, the broader
market and the national economy.

[Greater innovation and **access to capital energizes the economy and
allows more companies to succeed**. This in turn provides more
employment opportunities for American workers. This is
critical]{.underline} in an age where labor is being curtailed through
automation. It is time for the Securities Law of 2020 to make this
happen.

#### Financial regulations wreck [innovation]{.underline} and the [economy]{.underline}\-\--[every crisis in history]{.underline} proves. 

George **Selgin 16**. Senior Fellow and Director Emeritus, Center for
Monetary and Financial Alternatives. \"The Perils of Financial
Over-Regulation\". Cato Institute. 10-25-2016.
https://www.cato.org/blog/perils-financial-over-regulation

For some reason Rogoff doesn't seem to mind this. Yet surely it ought to
be obvious that, [when governments "win‐​out" by suppressing "much better
ways of doing things," **the public as a whole**]{.underline} --- and
not just or mainly drug dealers and tax evaders ---
**[looses]{.underline}**.

But [the]{.underline} more serious [consequences]{.underline} of a
"Whac‐​a‐​mole" approach [to financial innovation consist]{.underline},
not of its immediate costs to consumers, but **[to the downstream
innovations that it prevents.]{.underline}**

As economist Israel Kirzner puts it in an excellent essay, "The Perils
of Regulation," while [regulations]{.underline} of the sort Rogoff
favors are only supposed to block particular innovations that [may have
some undesirable features]{.underline}, those
**[regulations]{.underline}** also **[end up blocking desirable
innovations]{.underline}** that haven't been foreseen by anyone,
including the regulators. [What's more, the same regulatory interference
is instead likely to "**set in motion a series of entrepreneurial
actions that ... may well lead to wholly unexpected and even undesirable
final outcomes**."]{.underline}

In any event, Rogoff is surely mistaken in claiming that governments are
bound to prevent financial innovations from taking place even when they
are desirable. Whether they do so or not depends on public opinion.

It's true that the public has mixed feelings about financial innovation;
it has seen both good and bad consequences of such. But there are good
reasons for believing that **[unhindered financial
innovation]{.underline}**, whatever its risks, **[is ultimately a lot
safer than heavy‐​handed government interference in the financial
sector]{.underline}**. Those reasons are necessarily based on the
historical record, since no one, except perhaps some of you, can know
just what sorts of financial innovations the future may offer.

[Consider U.S. experience]{.underline}. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
unwise **[regulations have been responsible for most if not all of the
19th-century woes of the U.S. financial sector]{.underline}**, [from
wildcat banking and counterfeiting prior to the Civil War to recurring
banking crises afterwards]{.underline}. I would regale, or more likely
bore you, with the details if I had time. But instead I must settle for
pointing out that Canada, with its then‐​identical gold dollar, avoided
practically all of them. Yet Canadian banks were less, not more, heavily
regulated than their U.S. counterparts. Nor did Canada establish a
central bank until 1935. (Can anyone guess how many of its banks failed
during the 1930s?)

#### [Overregulation]{.underline} crushes [small banks]{.underline} and customers\-\--[markets are best]{.underline}. 

**Herald-Times 15**. \"Overregulation hurts bank customers, destroys
incentives to engage in banking\".
https://www.heraldtimesonline.com/story/opinion/2015/04/27/overregulation-hurts-bank-customers-destroys-incentives-to-engage-in-banking/117487452/

A recent Wall Street Journal story noted that in the three decades
[before]{.underline} the [Dodd-Frank]{.underline} bank regulation law
passed in 2010, an average of [more than 100 new banks opened each year.
In the five years since 2010]{.underline}, exactly [one new bank has
opened]{.underline} --- a small bank in Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania,
serving the Amish community.

[Going from more than 100 new banks each year to only one new bank in
five years is an **amazing decline**]{.underline}. The article notes:
"Bankers say **[the drought is a sign of new regulatory
requirements]{.underline}** in the wake of the financial crisis, which
are boosting expenses and discouraging potential startups from even
trying."

Certainly, low interest rates and a struggling economy are also factors.
But from my experience, **[onerous federal regulations are playing a
large role in destroying incentives to engage in the banking
business]{.underline}**. The small staff at the new Bank of Bird-in-Hand
includes one officer whose full-time duty is to deal with regulatory
affairs. In addition, the bank must hire consultants to help it comply
with regulations.

In March, a representative of the banking industry testified before the
House Financial Services Committee, saying that "an avalanche of new
rules, guidance and seemingly ever-changing expectations of the
regulators" is hindering hometown banks in their efforts to serve
customers.

Community banks have been the backbone of hometowns across America. But,
according to the American Bankers Association (ABA), some 1,200 fewer
community banks exist in the United States today than just five years
ago. "That trend will continue until some rational changes are made that
will provide some relief to America's hometown banks."

[Examples of regulatory overkill abound]{.underline}. The ABA testimony
before Congress cited a Texas bank that was forced to use a computerized
underwriting model to avoid inadvertent fair lending violations,
eliminating lending discretion by loan officers. But the
one-size-fits-all system rejected applications from loyal bank customers
of many decades, some of whom had never made late loan payments.

[Over-regulation]{.underline} often [reduces bank
flexibility]{.underline} to meet the unique circumstances of customers.
Common sense is replaced by complex rules. Fear of violating regulations
and potential lawsuits leads to fewer loans, hurting customers and their
communities.

Some members of Congress are proposing legislation to improve the
regulatory environment for banks. The ABA is specifically asking
Congress for four things:

1\. Remove impediments to serving customers.

2\. Improve access to home loans.

3\. Ensure proper oversight of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
which is the source of many byzantine regulations.

4\. Redefine a "systemically important financial institution" to make
the designation more practical and apply to the largest banks.

The ABA noted in its testimony that unnecessary regulatory requirements
distort the marketplace and constrict the natural cycle of facilitating
credit, job growth and economic expansion --- "leading to inefficiencies
and higher expenses which reduce resources devoted to lending and
investment."

It makes no sense to treat all banks as if they were the largest and
most complex institutions. [In trying to prevent excesses that occurred
before the 2008 financial crisis, federal regulators **swept up smaller
banks in regulatory regimes** better suited for the gigantic Wall Street
institutions.]{.underline}

I'm not suggesting that banks be deregulated. Reasonable regulations are
absolutely needed to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking
system. But **[the natural constraints and incentives of the free
market]{.underline}** system also **[play an important
role]{.underline}**. [Banks obviously won't be successful if they don't
treat customers fairly and if they aren't careful and wise in loan and
investment policies and decisions]{.underline}.

### Internal Link\-\--AT: Financial Deregulation Bad\-\--2NC

#### Deregulation doesn't cause crisis\-\--their evidence is myth. 

Norbert **Michel 16**. Forbes Contributor. \"Time To Fix The
Overregulation Problem In Financial Markets\". Forbes. 5-3-2016.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/norbertmichel/2016/05/03/time-to-fix-the-overregulation-problem-in-financial-markets/?sh=4bcb6de63db8

Today [I'm]{.underline} unabashedly [promoting three new policy
publications]{.underline}, all [related to]{.underline} the causes and
the misguided cleanup of [the 2008 financial crisis]{.underline}.
They're available here, here and here. Free of charge.

[The first]{.underline} paper [examines an **unrelenting myth: that the
crisis was caused by financial market deregulation**]{.underline}.
**[This]{.underline}** notion [**is demonstrably wrong**. The U.S. has
not substantially reduced financial regulations at any time during the
last 100+ years.]{.underline}

A deregulated market is one where no government agency regulates the
types of products and services people are allowed to produce and
purchase. [That sort of financial market did not exist prior to the 2008
crisis]{.underline}. For at least three-quarters of a century, federal
regulators have increasingly micromanaged financial firms' activities,
despite the fact that this approach has repeatedly failed to prevent
market turmoil.

It is true that U.S. regulators have sometimes allowed financial
institutions to engage in activities from which they were previously
restricted. But it's a giant leap to call these changes deregulation
because virtually all financial market activity has increasingly taken
place under the watchful eye of federal regulators. That's been the
trend since at least the 1930s, and it didn't slow down during the
Reagan, Bush I, Clinton or Bush II years.

The paper presents a comprehensive collection of examples (mostly from
the last 35 years) frequently cited to support the financial
deregulation hypothesis, and it details what the new rules and
regulations actually did.

For instance, a 2004 amendment to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) net capital rule is often cited as deregulatory. This amendment,
as the story goes, allowed companies such as Lehman and Goldman to take
on so much debt that they became too risky.

There are several problems with this story. First of all, [the numbers
show that the major investment banks were actually more highly
leveraged]{.underline} (more debt relative to equity) [in 1998 than in
2006]{.underline}, after the rule was changed (and just prior to the
2008 crisis).

### Internal Link\-\--Dems Cause Inflation\-\--2NC

#### Dems cause [inflation]{.underline}\-\--decks the [economy]{.underline}. 

Byron **York 5/19/22**. Chief political correspondent for The Washington
Examiner. \"What if Democrats had made the economy even worse?\".
https://www.times-news.com/opinion/columns/what-if-democrats-had-made-the-economy-even-worse/article_eaa46cd4-d791-11ec-8a1a-9b8c0411710c.html

President Biden likes to blame inflation on the COVID pandemic and the
war in Ukraine --- or, as he says, "Putin's price hike." But the fact
is, [Biden's]{.underline} own [**actions**, and those of **his
party**]{.underline}, have also [contributed]{.underline} significantly
[to the rise in the cost of living that is making it **harder and harder
for many Americans to make ends meet**]{.underline}. And [that
rise]{.underline}, in turn, [is feeding a terrible pessimism among
Americans]{.underline} about the state of the country.

Even some liberal commentators are admitting that **[Biden and Capitol
Democrats fed inflation]{.underline}** [by passing **enormous spending
bills**]{.underline}, measures that provided far more stimulus to the
economy that it needed. That was certainly true of the giant \$1.9
"COVID relief" bill called the American Rescue Plan, signed into law by
Biden on March 11, 2021. The left-leaning website Vox recently published
a story with the headline, "Biden's American Rescue Plan worsened
inflation. The question is how much."

The answer that Vox gave was --- a lot. "Inflation has been happening
across the world, caused by pandemic-related disruptions and exacerbated
this year by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's COVID-19
lockdowns," Vox said. "But [regarding]{.underline} the exact amount of
[inflation, the **U.S. stands out**]{.underline}. And it started to
stand out shortly after President Biden took office. The U.S. did a lot
more stimulus than these other countries, and now it's seeing a lot more
core inflation."

"**[We put gasoline on the fire]{.underline}**," Marc Goldwein of the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told Vox. "That's basically
what the American Rescue Plan did." Democrats simply did not take the
prospect of inflation seriously enough. "The American Rescue Plan wasn't
the primary cause of today's inflation," Vox concluded. "But [if
inflation was always going to be a problem, then it's important to
**avoid policies that could make it a much worse
problem**]{.underline}."

[The inflation that Biden and his Democratic colleagues have worsened is
taking a **terrible toll**]{.underline} both on the American household
budget and the American sense of optimism. In a new NBC News poll,
answering the classic right track-wrong track question, 75% of
respondents said they believe the country is on the wrong track. Just
16% said the country is headed in the right direction. That 75% is the
highest number since the terrible days of the economic collapse in 2008.
And the 16% is the lowest since the same time.

The situation has sent Biden's job approval rating even lower --- 39%
among all Americans, and 42% among registered voters. And there is one
big reason why. When NBC asked respondents the most important issue
facing the country, a full 40% named inflation and jobs and the economy
--- far and away at the top of the voters' priority list. To give you a
comparison, the war in Ukraine placed seventh on the list, and COVID was
barely on the list at all. A full 65% said their income is not keeping
up with rising costs. How could they not be worried?

So there's no doubt things are bad. But **[it's important to remember
that last year Democrats tried]{.underline}** very, very hard ---
indeed, made it the party's top priority --- **[to make things
worse]{.underline}**. Remember Build Back Better? It was the massive
social spending scheme that Biden and the Democratic Party made the
centerpiece of their agenda. At times, the proposal was about \$3.5
trillion --- dwarfing the \$1.9 trillion of the American Rescue Plan ---
even though progressive Democrats wanted it to be much more, closer to
\$6 trillion. Then it shrank to \$2.5 trillion, and then, perhaps, less
than that.

In November of last year, the House passed a bill that would spend
roughly \$2.2 trillion. All but one House Democrat voted for the bill,
and no Republicans were in favor of it. GOP lawmakers were emphatic that
passing another huge spending measure, on top of the American Rescue
Plan and the \$1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which a
minority of Republicans in the Senate and House had signed on to, would
worsen inflation. They were, of course, correct.

Then Build Back Better got bogged down in the Senate, thanks to the
stand taken by one man --- Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.
Like Republicans, Manchin expressed fear that the spending would create
what he called "inflation taxes that are real and harmful to every
hardworking American at the gasoline pumps, grocery stores and utility
bills with no end in sight."

Manchin took a beating in the liberal press, but he was right. And now
recognition of that is coming from unexpected places. Over the weekend,
Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, world's second-richest man and owner of
the Washington Post, reminded the world of what Democrats had hoped to
do. "In fact, the administration tried hard to inject even more stimulus
into an already overheated, inflationary economy and only Manchin saved
them from themselves," Bezos tweeted. "Inflation is a regressive tax
that most hurts the least affluent."

It's true. Now, [with inflation raging, many hope **Democrats will stop
pushing for more trillion-dollar bills**]{.underline}. But [in midterm
campaigning, do not be surprised to hear Republican candidates charge
Democrats not only with **making the economy worse, but with planning to
do even more damage**]{.underline}, if only they had the chance.

https://voxeu.org/article/understanding-global-role-us-economy

[Because of its size and interconnectedness, [developments in the US
economy]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}are bound to **[[have important
effects around the world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The US has the
world's]{.mark} single [largest economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP]{.underline} (at market
exchange rates), one-fifth of global FDI, and more than a third of stock
market capitalisation. [[It is the **most important export destination**
for one-fifth of countries]{.mark} around the world. [The]{.mark} US
[dollar is the **most widely used currency**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}in global trade and financial transactions, [and
[changes]{.mark} in US]{.underline} monetary policy and [investor
sentiment play a major role in **[driv]{.mark}ing [global
financing]{.mark} conditions**]{.underline} (World Bank 2016).

At the same time, the global economy is important for the US as well.
Affiliates of US multinationals operating abroad, and affiliates of
foreign companies located in the US account for a large share of US
output, employment, cross-border trade and financial flows, and stock
market capitalisation. Recent studies have examined the importance of
global growth for the US economy (Shambaugh 2016), the global impact of
changes in US monetary policy (Rey 2013), or the global effect of
changing US trade policies (Furman et al. 2017, Crowley et al. 2017).

It is likely that there will be shifts in US growth, monetary and fiscal
policies, as well as uncertainty in US financial markets. What will be
the global spillovers? Our recent work (Kose et al. 2017) attempts to
answer these questions:

- How synchronised are US and global business cycles?

- How large are global spillovers from US growth and policy shocks?

- How important is the global economy for the US?

- How synchronised are US and global business cycles?

[[Business cycles]{.mark} in the US, other advanced
economies]{.underline} (AEs), [and emerging market and developing
economies]{.underline} (EMDEs) [[have been **highly
synchronous**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Figure 1.A). [[This]{.mark} partly
[reflects]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the strength of
[[global]{.underline}]{.mark} trade and financial [[linkages]{.mark} of
the US economy with the rest of the world, [but also]{.mark} that global
[shocks]{.mark} drive common]{.underline} cyclical [fluctuations. [This
was]{.mark} particularly [the case at]{.mark} the time of
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}2008-**[[09]{.mark} Global
[Crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is not a new phenomenon, however.
Although the four recessions the global economy experienced since 1960
(1975, 1982, 1991, and 2009) were driven by many problems in many
places, they all overlapped with severe recessions in the US (Kose and
Terrones 2015).

Other countries tend to be in the same business cycle phase as the US
roughly 80% of the time (Figure 1.B). The degree of synchronisation with
US financial cycles is slightly lower, but still significant -- credit,
housing, and equity price cycles are in the same phase about 60% of the
time. Although it is difficult to establish empirically whether the US
economy leads business and financial cycle turning points in other
economies, recent research indicates that the US appears to influence
the timing and duration of recessions in many major economies (Francis
et al. 2015).

How large are global spillovers from US growth and policy shocks?

[A surge in US [growth]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}-- whether due to
expansionary fiscal policies or other reasons -- [**[could]{.mark}
provide a significant [boost]{.mark} to [the global economy]{.mark}**[.
Shocks]{.mark} to the US economy **[transmit]{.mark} to the rest of the
world**]{.underline} through three main channels.

[An [acceleration]{.mark} in US activity [can lift]{.mark} growth in
[**trading partners**]{.mark} directly]{.underline} through an increase
in import demand, [and indirectly by [strengthening productivity
**spillovers**]{.mark} embedded in trade.]{.underline}

[[Financial market]{.mark} developments in the US may [have]{.mark} even
wider [global implications]{.mark}. US]{.underline} bond and equity
[markets are the largest and most liquid]{.underline} in the world [and
the US dollar is the currency mostly widely used in trade and financial
transactions. This makes US]{.underline} monetary [policy]{.underline}
and investor confidence important **[drivers of global financial
conditions]{.underline}** (Arteta et al. 2015, IMF2015).

[[Given its role in global **commodity markets**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(the US is both the world's largest gas and oil consumer and producer),
[changes in [US growth]{.mark} prospects [can affect **global**
]{.mark}**commodity [prices]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This affects
activity, fiscal and balance of payment developments in commodity
exporters.

Estimates indicate that [[a percentage]{.mark}-point [increase in US
growth could boost]{.mark} growth in [advanced economies by 0.8]{.mark}
of a percentage point, [and]{.mark} in [emerging]{.mark} market and
[developing economies by 0.6]{.mark} of a percentage point after one
year]{.underline} (Figure 2.A). [[Investment could respond]{.mark} even
**[more strongly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A boost to investment could
come for instance from fiscal stimulus measures -- but the effect would
largely depend on the circumstances of the implementation of these
measures, including the amount of remaining economic slack, the response
of monetary policy, and the adjustment of household and business
expectations to the prospect of higher deficit and debt levels. A faster
tightening of US monetary policy than previously expected could, for
instance, lead to sudden increases in borrowing costs, currency
pressures, financial market volatility, and capital outflows for more
vulnerable emerging market and developing economies.

\"I think [we are living at a moment]{.underline} in time [where [the

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Organization for Economic

estimates for 2020 of downside economic damage to the United States and
other countries from COVID, but [most of the world won't get back to
pre-2020 GDP]{.underline} even [by the end of 2021]{.underline}. Only
one major economy---China---will experience significant growth (almost 2
percent) in 2020, ending up 10 percent larger by the end of 2021. The
situation could become worse for the West if there's inadequate fiscal
stimulus. Many economists believe the [slow]{.underline} US [recovery
from the 2008 financial crisis]{.underline} was partly due to the
premature withdrawal of stimulus and an emphasis on deficit-reduction
starting in 2010. In Europe, post-2008 austerity measures exacerbated
the problem of slow growth. Keep in mind as well that the 2008 financial
crisis **[spawned the ongoing populist surge in the United States and

### AT: Democracy Impact Turn\-\--2NC

#### Democracy impact turn is all [partisanship]{.underline}\-\--if people [want the GOP in 2022]{.underline}, it is democratic. Their evidence is [dem propaganda]{.underline}. 

Zaid **Jilani 22**. Freelance journalist who has previously worked for

University of Georgia and received his master's from Syracuse
University. \"It's Coups All the Way Down\". Tablet Magazine. 1-11-2022.
https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/coups-all-the-way-down

[The Democratic Party's message ahead of the 2022 midterms]{.underline}
appears to be simple: **[Vote for us or democracy gets
it]{.underline}**.

"I'm worried that [if Republicans win in the midterm elections, that
voting as we know it in]{.underline} this country [will be
gone]{.underline}," warned California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell
during a recent MSNBC appearance. "This is not only the most important
election. If we don't get it right, [it could be the last
election]{.underline}."

Across the progressive Democratic messaging infrastructure, the party
and movement have rebranded themselves as the protectors of the
democratic ideal, which, in their telling, is on the verge of
extinction.

President [Biden]{.underline} has [warned that GOP election
laws]{.underline} that would, among other things, require voters to
write down their state ID number on absentee ballots, [are]{.underline}
the equivalent of "[Jim Crow on steroids]{.underline}," while more or
less comparing Virginia's Republican Governor-elect Glenn Youngkin to a
Capitol rioter.

Heads of influential progressive political action committees worry aloud
that we will see a swing of "power to Republican politicians, which ends
American democracy." Liberal opinion columnists lament that the GOP is
plotting to "take control of more and more of the apparatus of voting to
ensure that Republicans can never lose."

But **[if you sincerely value liberal democracy]{.underline}**---not
just majority rule but open debate and the protection of individual and
minority rights---**[it can be hard not to notice the
irony]{.underline}**: [A political movement]{.underline} that has worked
so hard to censor and marginalize its opponents in virtually all
institutions [is claiming that it now represents the **vanguard of
democracy**]{.underline}.

I'm not pointing this out to prove to progressives that they are just a
bunch of hypocrites who don't really value liberal democracy.

[I'm]{.underline} writing this because I am [worried about
democracy]{.underline} in the United States. [I **won't validate Biden
or Swalwell's outlandish claims about democracy ending in the next
election**]{.underline} or Jim Crow reasserting itself in GOP-run
states, but I do think [it's]{.underline} deeply [unhealthy that so many
people]{.underline} in our country [distrust]{.underline} the news
media, public institutions, and their [elected
representatives]{.underline}.

Take Swalwell, who ominously predicted that a GOP victory in the midterm
elections---leaving the Democrats in control of the executive branch, of
course---would mark the extinction of American democracy.

When Twitter decided to ban Georgia Republican Congresswoman Marjorie
Taylor Greene because she espoused skepticism toward COVID vaccines,
genuine advocates for free speech and open debate were outraged. How can
a private company that runs the modern public square, the equivalent of
a public utility, unilaterally decide to silence an official elected by
the people?

Even House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has been skeptical of
bipartisan congressional oversight of Silicon Valley, criticized Twitter
for shutting down what he called "constitutionally protected speech."
But Swalwell was unsympathetic to Greene losing her right to speak on
the platform. "Kevin McCarthy hates free markets. He wants government to
have absolute control over private businesses," he thundered. "Is there
a word for this?"

Suddenly, the defender of democracy transformed into an advocate for
corporate control of public debate, using an argument that wouldn't be
out of place in a Milton Friedman tract. As hypocritical as it was, it
was hardly surprising.

Last year we saw Twitter work with Facebook to suppress the spread of a
New York Post story about Joe Biden's son Hunter. The announcement that
the story would be throttled on Facebook came from Andy Stone, a
Facebook communications staffer who previously worked for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.

No prominent Democratic elected official protested the suppression of
the story, which quickly became a bigger story than the content of the
Post article itself. And why would they? It was clear that, in this
case, [the Democrats weren't after **democratic legitimacy** but
**political hegemony**]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} stood to
[benefit more from having the world's most powerful digital
communications companies actively suppress speech that could assist
their political opponents than from standing by the principle of freedom
of expression]{.underline}.

Daniel **Larison 12**. PhD in history from the University of Chicago

Rojas' claim depends entirely on the meaning of "genuine democracy."
Even though there are numerous examples of wars between states with
universal male suffrage and elected governments (including that little
dust-up known as WWI), the states in question probably don't qualify as
"genuine" democracies and so can't be used as counter-examples.

understand it is that democratic governments are more accountable to
their populations, and because the people will bear the costs of the war
they are going to be less willing to support a war policy. This
supposedly keeps democratic states from waging wars against one another
because of the built-in electoral and institutional checks on government
power. One small problem with this is that it **[is
rubbish]{.underline}**.

[**Democracies in antiquity fought against one another**. Political
equality and voting do not abolish conflicts]{.underline} of interest
between competing states. [Democratic peace theory doesn't account for
the effects of **nationalist and imperialist ideologies**]{.underline}
on the way democratic nations think about war. [Democratic nations that
have professional armies to do the fighting for them are often
enthusiastic about overseas wars. The Conservative-Unionist government
that waged the South African War]{.underline} (against two states with
elected governments, I might add) [enjoyed great popular support and won
a huge majority in the "Khaki" election that followed]{.underline}.

As long as it goes well and doesn't have too many costs, [**war can be
quite popular**, and even if the war is costly it may still be popular
if it is fought for nationalist reasons that appeal to a majority of the
public]{.underline}. If the public is whipped into thinking that there
is an intolerable foreign threat or if they believe that their country
can gain something at relatively low cost by going to war, the type of
government they have really is irrelevant. Unless a democratic public
believes that a military conflict will go badly for their military, they
may be ready to welcome the outbreak of a war that they expect to win.
[Setting aside the flaws and failures of U.S.-led democracy promotion
for a moment, the idea that reducing the number of non-democracies makes
war less likely is **just fantasy**. Clashing interests between states
aren't going away, and the more democratic states there are in the world
the more likely it is that two or more of them will **eventually fight
one another**.]{.underline}

### AT: Trump 2024 Impact Turn\-\--2NC

#### 2022 [doesn't impact]{.underline} 2024 AND its [too soon]{.underline}.

Using The Midterms To Predict Presidential Elections\". FiveThirtyEight.

[The 2022 midterm election hasn't even happened yet]{.underline}, but
**[speculation about the 2024 presidential race is already
underway]{.underline}**, with many potential candidates positioning
themselves for a possible run --- and in the case of former President
Donald Trump, doing so quite publicly. [Early general election polls are
already testing Trump]{.underline} against President Biden, too, [with
many **questioning whether Biden will even run again in
2024**]{.underline}, when he'd be 81 years old. Some Democrats have even
gone as far as to venture that a rough midterm election for their party
--- which seems quite possible --- might discourage Biden from running
again, opening the door for Vice President Kamala Harris or another
Democrat to win the party's nomination.

But while a strong Republican performance in 2022 might influence
Biden's thinking on 2024, **[it's a mistake to expect the midterm result
to predict]{.underline}** how the country will vote in
**[the]{.underline}** ensuing **[presidential election]{.underline}**.
As the chart below shows, **[there's little relationship]{.underline}**
between the margin in the national popular vote for the U.S. House in a
midterm election and the national popular vote margin in the next
presidential contest.1 So [whatever happens in the House this November,
**don't expect it to forecast the results of the next presidential
race**.]{.underline}

**[More often than not]{.underline}**, [midterm and presidential results
have been **miles apart**]{.underline}. For instance, in 1994, the GOP
captured Congress in the midterm "Republican Revolution" amidst
then-President Bill Clinton's poor approval ratings, winning the House
popular vote by about 7 percentage points. But in 1996, Clinton ended up
claiming a sleepy reelection victory by 8.5 points over Bob Dole --- a
swing of more than 15 points. In fact, on average, there's been a swing
of about 12 points from the midterm to the subsequent presidential
contest.

That said, midterm elections and their following presidential races have
sometimes run close together: Democrats swept back into power in the
2006 midterm election with an 8-point edge in the House vote, for
instance, and then-President Barack Obama won by a similar 7-point
margin nationally in 2008. In fact, midterm and presidential elections
have run closer together in recent years --- but importantly, there is
still not much of a relationship despite this. Rather, this seems to be
happening because landslide presidential wins are increasingly a thing
of the past. Instead, lopsided midterm results for the party not in the
White House are increasingly becoming the norm, then followed by highly
competitive presidential races.

One big reason [midterm and presidential elections]{.underline} have
such different outcomes is that they [are **fundamentally different
kinds of contests**]{.underline}. [Midterm elections]{.underline}, for
instance, tend to [have]{.underline} much [lower turnout]{.underline}
than presidential elections, and what's more, [voters from the party
that's not in the White House are often much more likely to turn
out.]{.underline} Additionally, [some voters **switch**]{.underline}
from the president's party because of dissatisfaction with the status
quo. And because the president's party usually loses ground in a
midterm, you still often see narratives that suggest a president's
reelection chances may now be in peril just after a midterm election.

Yet **[presidents]{.underline}** can, of course, **[change their
approach following a]{.underline}** difficult **[midterm]{.underline}**
and/or their opponents in Congress can overstep after winning power,
both of which can help improve the president's public standing.
[And]{.underline} perhaps most importantly, **[two years is a lifetime
in politics]{.underline}**, **[leaving plenty of time for important
factors]{.underline}** like the state of the economy or war and peace
**[to change]{.underline}** in meaningful ways that will influence the
electorate. For instance, [a struggling economy, mediocre approval
ratings, and a bad midterm can become a roaring economy, "Morning Again
In America," and a landslide victory]{.underline} in that narrow span of
time, as was the case for former President Ronald Reagan's 1984
reelection bid.

Given all this, Biden and **[Democrats]{.underline}** who are uncertain
about the party's standing probably **[shouldn't look to the 2022
election result as a sign of]{.underline}** whether the president can
win in **[2024]{.underline}**. It's true that the midterm outcome could
alter the public's perception of Washington if Biden is facing off with
a GOP-controlled Congress. But the actual midterm results won't really
tell us whether Biden is doomed or can win reelection. After all, we
have no idea where things will stand in a couple years when it comes to
the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and the overall economy, much less
sudden developments like the U.S.'s potential role in the conflict in
Ukraine.

Of course, with all this said, [it is indeed fun to take a look at the
early polling of the 2024 race]{.underline} --- trust me, it's like
catnip. [Nevertheless, we need to **take those early polls with many
grains of salt**]{.underline}. After all, [even polls taken six months
out from the general election are only **moderately
predictive**]{.underline} of the final result --- and at that point, we
usually know who the nominees are.

The 2024 election is likely to be pretty competitive considering how
divided our politics are, but the candidates do matter at the margins.
So [regardless of how many polls test Biden against Trump, time will
tell whether we will really see the first general election rematch since
1956]{.underline} --- or if one or both parties end up nominating
someone else entirely. But one thing is for certain: [The result this
November **will not guarantee any result for November
2024**.]{.underline}

Grady **Means 5/16/22**. Opinion Contributor \"We need a reset with the
midterms --- and then Biden's impeachment\". Hill. 5-16-2022.
https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3487514-we-need-a-reset-with-the-midterms-and-then-bidens-impeachment/

[The upcoming midterm]{.underline} elections [could represent the most
complex political calculus in history. The question is whether a
potential Republican majority]{.underline} in the House and Senate,
combined with a bloc of pragmatic Democratic senators, **[might decide
to impeach]{.underline}** President **[Biden and]{.underline}** Vice
President Kamala **[Harris]{.underline}**. [Doing so could
be]{.underline} the one **[key to reducing]{.underline}** the
**[polarization]{.underline}** of American politics **[and salvaging
American civil society.]{.underline}**

Joe Biden has set the stage for his demise. The American economy is in a
death spiral. Inflation is skyrocketing, and most of the voting public
understands that the disaster is because of Biden's policies. His lame
attempts to blame everyone but himself ("conspiracies" among energy
companies, auto companies, food companies, irrational consumers, etc.)
are falling on deaf ears. The polls are clear: the majority of voters
feel Biden is mishandling the economy. His tone-deaf message that more
government spending will heal the problem is not resonating with voters.

Pension plans --- yes, those plans that provide pensions for teachers,
firefighters, police, other public employees, union members and all
other private sector workers --- are in serious jeopardy. IRA and 401(k)
savings are collapsing. Inflation is eating up the incomes and wage
gains of all middle-class and low-income workers. The Fed's rising
interest rates will crush the market and further raise the net cost of
financing business, houses, cars, etc.

Biden's energy policies have been a disaster. Every American, every day,
sees the results of his policies when they fill up their cars with gas
or pay their utility bills. Prices have skyrocketed under Biden and some
Americans may be forced to travel less, live more in the dark, have
colder homes in the winter and hotter homes in the summer, and suffer
more regular blackouts. Biden's progressive utopia: The New and
Primitive Dark Ages.

Additionally, Biden's Transportation and Treasury leadership have been
abject failures at stemming supply chain problems, trade issues, and
economic collapse.

Many Black and Hispanic American citizens reportedly are leaving the
Democratic Party as they realize that Biden's illegal and criminal
open-border policies have led to millions of illegal immigrants flooding
the country, taking away lower-wage jobs and diluting the voting power
of minorities. American citizens also realize that these policies are
bringing in criminals with illegal drugs, spiking urban crime and
drug-related deaths.

The Biden administration's COVID policies and lockdowns were abject
failures and led to accelerated deaths, mental illness, and economic
contraction.

Biden's notion that teachers "own" America's children, and have as much
or more rights than parents in teaching children values and beliefs, is
straight from the communist playbook. The Justice Department's reported
branding of upset American parents as "domestic terrorists," if true, is
beyond appalling.

And Biden's fully incompetent, politically motivated defense and foreign
policies and leadership have invited aggression and adventurism by our
enemies --- which will only get worse.

Most importantly, Biden's politics and rhetoric, and his weaponization
of the Justice Department against ordinary Americans, has been
unprecedented in its divisiveness, corrosive to American civil society.
His overt support for progressive street riots, burning cities, and
physical intimidation of his opponents represents a new low in American
democracy.

[Biden and Harris **need to go now**, and the **2022 elections provide a
unique opportunity**]{.underline} for a desperately needed reset.

[Without such a reset, the **future is clear**]{.underline}. Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** almost assuredly [**will return as president**.
Americans will choose the devil they know, rather than the devil they no
longer can stand. It is time for aggressive, "radical moderation," and
the first step is for the next House and Senate to **impeach, convict
and remove Biden and Harris**]{.underline}.

How would that work?

If Republicans take control of the House, they can move quickly on
Articles of Impeachment. The Biden administration has been breaking the
law to a level that dramatically exceeds the threshold of "high crimes."
The immigration policies alone qualify for summary judgment. The
weaponization of the Justice Department follows close behind. Various
Republican groups are assembling a list of investigations into rampant
law-breaking by the Biden administration.

Harris, with her portfolio covering illegal immigration and her overt
support for urban violence, is an equally guilty target.

Of course, the indication on Hunter Biden's laptop that Joe Biden likely
was involved in potential criminal activity involving payoffs from
foreign enemies could become additional evidence of high crimes.

The Senate should convict and remove Biden and Harris before the end of
January 2023. The House Speaker would then succeed Biden --- most
Americans would agree that anyone would be a vast improvement --- and,
in the spirit of national reconciliation, a hard-as-nails moderate
Democrat should be chosen as vice president. Two obvious candidates
would be Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) or Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.),
with Manchin getting the nod because he'd be one-term.

Moderate Democratic senators should leap at this opportunity. If they
don't, they almost certainly will get Trump in 2024, along with another
red wave in the House and Senate.

[Such a reset would pay **huge dividends**]{.underline} for America and
both political parties. It would reverse Biden's destructive economic
and energy policies and stop his and Harris's divisive rhetoric. [It
would lead to open, competitive presidential primaries for both parties,
and provide some hope for **stopping the next Trump train
wreck**]{.underline}. [It would **moderate**]{.underline} and, perhaps,
return some civility to **[American politics. It would save
America]{.underline}**.

### XT\-\--Trump Now\-\--2NR

#### Trump is the favorite 

Todd **Dewey 10/14/21**. \"Donald Trump now betting favorite to win 2024
presidential election\". Las Vegas Review-Journal.
https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/betting/donald-trump-now-betting-favorite-to-win-2024-presidential-election-2459354/

For the first time since Donald [Trump]{.underline} left office, he [has
surpassed]{.underline} Joe [Biden as the **betting favorite to win the
2024 presidential election**.]{.underline}

[Trump emerged as the favorite Monday at multiple offshore
sportsbooks]{.underline} to return to the White House in 2024. On
Wednesday, [he became the top choice over]{.underline} President [Biden
at Smarkets]{.underline}, a London-based betting exchange.
[Trump]{.underline} also [is now the favorite at Ladbrokes sportsbook in
London.]{.underline}

According to Smarkets, [the former president has a 20 percent chance,
which equates to odds of 4-1, of winning the 2024]{.underline} election
after having fallen as low as 3 percent, or 32-1, in the wake of the
U.S. Capitol attack in January.

Biden's odds dropped to 19 percent (+426), and Vice President Kamala
Harris' odds dropped to 13 percent (+669).

"It's a pretty staggering development to find a defeated one-term
president taking over as favorite from the incumbent who beat him, but
we know by now that Donald Trump is no ordinary politician," Smarkets
head of political markets Matthew Shaddick said. "It's early days, but
the latest market signals suggest there is every chance we could be
heading for a Biden vs. Trump rematch in 2024 with Trump currently
having a very slight edge, according to the betting."

**[At Ladbrokes, Trump is a +350 favorite over Biden]{.underline}**
(4-1) and Harris (5-1).

All betting odds can be converted into an implied chance, or percentage,
of something happening, and that is how Smarkets presents its odds.

[**Trump is the heavy favorite at Smarkets** to be the 2024 **Republican
nominee** with a 45 percent chance]{.underline} (+122).

"[Trump's odds have been **improving all year**]{.underline} and in
particular since Biden's poll ratings began declining this summer,"
Shaddick said. "[There is absolutely no sign of Republican voters
deserting him, and **he leads every primary poll by a
distance**.]{.underline}

However, **[recent odds]{.underline}** byBetfair Exchange
**[found]{.underline}** Mr **[Trump is now 4.8 to win in
