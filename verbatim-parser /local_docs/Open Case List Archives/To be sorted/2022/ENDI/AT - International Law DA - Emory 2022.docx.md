the term to the employment of either kinetic force or non-kinetic

[The UN Charter creates a system whereby the Security Council is
responsible for resolving international conflict]{.underline}. But what
happens when [a permanent member of the Security Council that has the
power to veto resolutions is the actor engaging in cyber election
interference]{.underline} against another nation? [This
article]{.underline} does not deal with the question of how a nation
should respond to election interference via cyberspace; it simply [deals
with the question of whether a nation can respond to cyber election
interference under the UN Charter]{.underline}. The only recourse that a
nation has to defend itself under this circumstance is through Article
51 of the UN Charter.

Article 51 states that "\[n\]othing in the present Charter shall impair
the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed
attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations." Some
international law scholars construe Article 51 as barring a nation from
responding to election interference via cyberspace through self-defense.
[This blog utilizes Russia's]{.underline} 2016 [cyber election
interference]{.underline} in the United States [as a case study to argue
that a **nation should be able to act in self-defense against cyber
election interference under Article 51** of the UN Charter]{.underline}.

The UN's Purpose

Article 1 of the UN Charter outlines the four fundamental purposes of
the United Nations. First, maintaining international peace and security;
second, developing friendly relations among nations that are grounded in
the belief that people must have equal rights and self-determination;
third, achieving international cooperation in promoting respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all; and fourth, being the
center for achieving these common goals.

These four purposes are interconnected and should not be conceived of
independently from one another. This is especially true for the first
two purposes of the charter because international peace is impossible if
one State does not recognize the equal rights and self-determination
(political sovereignty) of the people of another State. In other words,
international peace exists in conjunction with principles of liberty,
equality, and self-determination.

[Cyber Election Interference Threatens Political
Sovereignty]{.underline}

A U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report details how [the
Russian government attempted to influence "democracy]{.underline} in the
United Kingdom through disinformation, cyber hacking, and corruption."
For example, in the period leading to the Brexit referendum, a Russian
organization was "actively posting about Brexit" in an attempt to
influence the vote and magnify social discord. In 2017, a Russian
cyberespionage group launched phishing attacks against French
presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron\'s campaign. Days before the
runoff vote in France's presidential election, hacked emails from
Emmanuel Macron's campaign were leaked online in an attempt to influence
the result of the election.

An indictment by Special Counsel Robert Mueller against several members
of Russia's military intelligence agency describes how, in 2016, [Russia
"conducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S.
Presidential election]{.underline}." Russian agents hacked into the
emails of multiple Hillary Clinton campaign employees, including the
campaign chairman. They also infiltrated the computer networks of the
Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee to steal emails and documents. Russia also engaged in a
targeted information warfare campaign through social media by creating
fake social media accounts to instigate Americans to join a flash mob
opposing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential candidacy.
Furthermore, a report by the Senate Intelligence Committee extensively
details how Russian operatives specifically targeted African American
voters on social media.

[The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber
Operations explains that internal sovereignty includes the "authority of
a State to independently decide on its political]{.underline}, social,
cultural, economic, [and legal order." Cyber operations that disregard
another State's "exercise of its sovereign prerogatives constitute a
violation of such sovereignty and are prohibited by international law."
Russia's cyberattacks during America's]{.underline} 2016 presidential
[election disregarded the UN Charter's purposes of maintaining
international peace or respecting the right of self-determination, and
violated America's internal sovereignty.]{.underline}

Whether a State May Act in Self-Defense when Cyber Election Interference
Occurs

One view of cyber election interference is that these acts exist in a
"gray zone" of international law. Professor Gary Corn explains how
hostile activities in the "gray zone" of international law occur in "the
far more uncertain space between war and peace." They are understood as
actions that are aggressive and rise above normal but are "deliberately
designed to remain below the threshold of conventional military conflict
and open interstate war." International actors exploit this gray zone in
the law because they alter the status quo while not clearly violating
international law or starting war.

A second view, that of Professor Michael N. Schmitt, suggests that
Russia's cyber election interference "is not an initiation of an armed
conflict" and that, therefore, the U.S. cannot respond in self-defense
under the UN Charter. It is "impossible to draw definitive red lines
regarding cyber election meddling in the context of the territorial
aspect of sovereignty, except with respect to situations causing
physical damage or at least a significant impact on functionality."
Scholars also point to how armed attacks are typically those that can
cause death.

For example, international law experts who contributed to the Tallinn
Manual on International Law Rule 71(5) explain that a critical factor in
deciding whether a cyber intrusion is an armed conflict is determining
whether the cyber operation is analogous to actions "otherwise
qualifying as a kinetic armed attack." Moreover, the cyber operation
must involve the use of a cyber weapon, defined in the Tallinn Manual on
International Law Rule 103(2) as "cyber means of warfare that are used,
designed, or intended to be used to cause injury to, or death of,
persons or damage to, or destruction of, objects, that is, that result
in the consequences required for qualification of a cyber operation as
an attack."

A final view is that a nation may respond in self-defense when facing
cyber election interference. President Joe Biden has characterized
foreign election interference as a threat to "America's sovereignty,
democratic institutions, and national security." He has asserted that he
"will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act"
and make full use of "executive authority to impose substantial and
lasting costs on state perpetrators." These assertions are in line with
the long held view in the United States that Article 51 of the UN
Charter may be interpreted to mean that the country may act "in
self-defense in response to any amount of force by another State."

[A State Must be Able to Act in Self-Defense in the Face of Cyber
Election Interference]{.underline}

[The creation of cyberspace and the advancement of technology have
fundamentally changed the methods nation states may use to violate the
sovereignty of other nations]{.underline} or pose threats to
international peace. [Sovereignty is the first principle outlined in the
UN Charter]{.underline}, which declares that the "organization is based
on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members." The
fourth principle of the United Nations expounds on the importance of
sovereignty by establishing that "all members shall refrain in their
international relations from the threat or use of force against the
territorial integrity or political independence of any state." Finally,
sovereignty is connected with the U.N. Charter's second purpose, which
is to foster relations among nations based on respect for equal rights
and the self-determination of people.

Russia's [interference in the 2016]{.underline} American presidential
[election threatened the political integrity and sovereignty of the
United States and contradicted the principles and purpose of the UN
Charter. Any nation must be allowed to defend itself against such an act
of aggression. The United States' interpretation of Article 51 is the
**only means of upholding the purposes of the UN Charter**, especially
when cyberattacks are perpetuated by other members of the UN Security
Council]{.underline} that can veto UN Security Council resolutions.

Even if it were the case that cyber election interference were not
considered an "armed attack," Judge Simma noted in his separate opinion
for the Oil Platforms case, that a State is able to respond to an attack
that does not reach the "armed attack" threshold of Article 51 of the UN
Charter. Importantly, the State being attacked may defend itself "within
a more limited range and quality of responses...and bound to necessity,
proportionality and immediacy in time in a particularly strict way."
This viewpoint is in line with the International Court of Justice
opinion in the Nicaragua case that explained how even though one
nation's actions did not rise to the level of an armed attack, the acts
could have "justified proportionate counter-measures on the part of the
State which had been the victim of these acts."

Conclusion

[A nation must be able to respond to hostile acts by international
actors that threaten the soundness of its electoral system. This is not
only normatively beneficial but]{.underline} also **[comports with the
UN Charter's purpose]{.underline}**. Our perception of international
conflict often does not account for the technological advancements that
permit cyberspace to be exploited for harmful means. [It is critical
that we develop an understanding of international law that accounts for
the new challenges we face in world affairs.]{.underline}

[Taking stock of the state of the Law of Armed Conflict]{.underline}
(LOAC) [may be one of the most important tasks facing international law
today]{.underline}. In that vein, [it is well worth asking whether the
Law of Armed Conflict is still "fit]{.underline} for purpose"?

[As]{.underline} the current conflict in **[Ukraine illustrates all too
well]{.underline}**, [the answer is not an optimistic one. LOAC
increasingly faces an **existential challenge**]{.underline}. Namely,
growing **[lack of compliance by States and non-State
actors]{.underline}** (NSAs) threatens its entire legitimacy. [Failure
of States and NSAs to openly and consistently apply, affirm, and
legitimize the fundamental underlying principles of LOAC in today's
armed conflicts will put LOAC into **serious disuse**]{.underline}. It
will profoundly threaten the rule of law and humanity.

### XT\-\--Noncompliance\-\--1AR 

#### No one complies now\-\--[outweighs]{.underline} the link to the aff. 

Blaise **Cathcart 22**. Served as the Judge Advocate General (JAG) of
the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) from 2010-2017. \"The Creeping Normality
of LOAC Noncompliance\". Lieber Institute West Point. 4-13-2022.
https://lieber.westpoint.edu/creeping-normality-loac-noncompliance/

Armed conflict today is massively complex and challenging for States,
NSAs, and civil society. The operating environment is multi-domain,
hyper-violent, ambiguous, and often blurred. [Conflicts are
increasingly]{.underline} described as "new wars," "[grey
zone]{.underline} wars," [and]{.underline} "[hybrid]{.underline} wars."
They are more frequent, more protracted, more influenced by NSAs, more
violent, and exponentially more dangerous and deadly for civilian
populations. However, from the perspective of LOAC, it appears that
these "new wars" or "grey zone wars" present many of the same
challenges, albeit more of them, as "old wars" or "black and white zone
wars."

[A review of contemporary armed conflicts since the end of the Second
World War leads to a somewhat pessimistic view of the effectiveness,
credibility, and legitimacy of LOAC. Examining today's conflicts in
**Ukraine, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Somalia, and South Sudan, and past conflicts in the former
Yugoslavia, Chechnya, Rwanda, Columbia, Nicaragua, and Vietnam**, the
sheer number of **gross LOAC breaches and human rights violations**,
particularly against civilian populations, is **shocking and
abhorrent**]{.underline}. Whether such conflicts are considered
international armed conflicts (IACs), non-international armed conflicts
(NIACs), or a mix of both, LOAC applies. Every State is a Party to the
four Geneva Conventions (GCs) and they are considered reflective of
customary international law (CIL) binding on all States.

Yet, [in virtually every contemporary conflict]{.underline}, these
**[basic rules]{.underline}**---many of which are universally accepted
and fundamental rules of humanity---**[are consistently breached by
States and NSAs]{.underline}**. The International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC), along with most States, have acknowledged that
**[noncompliance with LOAC remains an "intractable
problem."]{.underline}** To my mind, [this problem is the **greatest
current challenge to the continued credibility of LOAC**]{.underline}
and there is an "imperative need" to improve compliance.

#### International law [norm violation is common]{.underline}\-\--even [unrelated fields]{.underline} thump the impact.

Windows" Problem?\". Lawfare.
https://www.lawfareblog.com/does-international-law-have-broken-windows-problem

[Many norms of international law]{.underline}, especially international
human rights law, [are **widely violated**. The international legal
system **as a whole may suffer as result**.]{.underline}

[International human rights law has changed international
law]{.underline}. The two primary sources of [international legal
obligations]{.underline}---treaties and custom---[have become more
expansive]{.underline} and looser so as to bring more human rights norms
into the ambit of international law, [despite **wide-spread
non-compliance with those norms**]{.underline}. In one sense, the
success of the effort is clear: international law now regulates a vast
array of human-rights-related conduct. Whether the expansion is an
effective way to promote human rights is widely-debated.

The broader, unacknowledged problem, however, is the potential effect of
the expansion on international law as a whole, as I discuss in detail
here. Today, international law includes a broad range of human rights
norms which are routinely violated, from the U.N. reporting requirements
to gross violations of human dignity. **[Wide-spread violations of some
legal norms may]{.underline}**, in turn, **[make it harder to enforce
others]{.underline}**. As a (very) imperfect analogy, consider the
"broken windows" theory of crime prevention: [widespread violations of
human rights law may be a **symbol of unaccountability**, a signal that
**no one cares** about violations of international law and that **no one
is in charge**]{.underline}. Accountability is a fundamental concern of
public international law because the system lacks a centralized
enforcement mechanism. Whatever the merits of the "broken windows"
argument in the context of domestic law enforcement, [behavior which
signals a **lack of accountability** may be especially **damaging to
international law writ large**.]{.underline}

Theoretical literature on compliance with international law suggests
that **[non-compliance in some areas makes other norms of international
law harder to enforce]{.underline}**. Work on rational choice posits,
for example, that states comply with international law in part to
protect their reputations. If [states as a whole tend to expect
non-compliance from each other, the costs of]{.underline} entering into
treaties or developing [norms]{.underline} of customary international
law [become higher for all states. A baseline reputation of
non-compliance among states generally harms interstate
cooperation]{.underline} because it means that states will have to do
more in a treaty agreement to generate trustworthy commitments (such as
monitoring non-compliance), and because it makes some agreements not
worth the time or effort. To be sure, [these effects depend upon states
having **reputations**]{.underline} for compliance **[which are
not]{.underline}** entirely **[issue-specific or compartmentalized, a
plausible assumption]{.underline}** for reasons explained here (pages
103-06).

### AT: UN Security Council Impact\-\--2AC

While the last century's great wars resulted in setting international
rules to regulate conduct during conflicts, and significantly advanced
international law (especially IHL), [international [norms around
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}-- [[and]{.mark} the
**[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}meant to face them,
[[particularly the **UN**]{.mark} Security Council]{.underline} --
[[have fallen **devastatingly short in resolving
conflicts**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This trend could **deepen**]{.mark}
in the context of the **evolving great-power competition**]{.underline}.

A reframing effort of such norms is overdue. The world needs a legal
instrument to aim at encouraging and supporting peace negotiations for
the peaceful settlement of internal armed conflicts.

The Middle East: Nexus of the World´s Challenges

The Middle East has the dubious distinction of hosting some of the
world´s most persistent and dire conflicts and crises. It is home to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one of the most enduring struggles. [The
UN]{.underline} Secretary General [declared the situation in Yemen to be
the world's worst humanitarian crisis]{.underline} with 80% of the
country's population in need of humanitarian assistance and protection.
Meanwhile, Syria has by far the largest forcibly displaced population
worldwide: 6.6 million refugees and more than 6 million internally
displaced people, constituting around half the Syrian population. The
conflict in Libya is characterised by a weak government, a constellation
of militias, and a political class in which many are not only backed by
foreign governments but also divided across ideological and tribal
lines. Meanwhile, Tunisia, Sudan, Lebanon, Algeria, and Iraq are facing
varying degrees of instability and civil strife. The Iranian nuclear
file and Iranian policies are also a source of major tension and
instability in the region.

Today, [[not a **single conflict in the Middle East** is on a]{.mark}
solid [path]{.mark} towards a political solution. A series of **[UN
peace envoys have come and gone to no avail]{.mark}**]{.underline},
while several of the [[parties]{.underline}]{.mark} involved continue to
[[pay lip service]{.mark} to political settlements [but act in a manner
more consistent with a military solution]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
polarisation witnessed in the region, with different countries
supporting opposing parties in conflicts, is making it exceedingly
difficult to achieve political settlements.

### XT\-\--UN Fails\-\--1AR

#### UN rules can't solve peace\-\--empirically [fails]{.underline} and great powers have [vetoes]{.underline}.

**[The UN]{.underline}**, however, **[failed utterly]{.underline}** --
as it was destined to -- [in instrumenting effective international
diplomacy]{.underline}. How worthy is it then to maintain a white
elephant like the UN? One may recall that the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988
was awarded to the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces "for preventing
armed clashes and creating conditions for negotiations."

However, **[the United Nations has failed to prevent war and fulfil
peacekeeping duties]{.underline}** many times during its history: [in
Palestine]{.underline}, ever since the creation of the Jewish state in
1948, in [Cambodia]{.underline} during the 1970s, in [the Somali civil
war]{.underline} since 1991, in [the Rwandan civil war]{.underline} in
1994, [during the Srebrenica Massacre]{.underline} in 1995, [during the
Darfur conflict in Sudan]{.underline} since 2003, [in the Iraq
invasion]{.underline} during 2003-11, [in the Syrian civil
war]{.underline} since 2011, [in South Sudan]{.underline} since 2013,
[in the Yemen civil war]{.underline} since 2014, [during the Rohingya
crisis in Myanmar]{.underline} since 2017, [among others]{.underline}.

On the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide in Kigali, Ban KiMoon
admitted that the UN had done a lot to prevent the slaughter of hundreds
of thousands of Tutsis but "could have done much more". [Certainly, it
could have done more with the Rohingya crisis, in Afghanistan, in the
Arab Spring, amid disasters in Haiti, the Philippines, and in many other
places]{.underline}. And, of course, [there is the classic example of
the Security Council's authorisation of force to turn back Saddam
Hussein's Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait]{.underline} in the early
1990s. [Is the 76-year-old UN a **toothless** and **clawless body that
no one takes seriously? Is it almost defunct?**]{.underline}

António [Guterres described Russia's move]{.underline} (to recognize the
so-called 'independence' of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk
regions) [as "a **death blow" to the Security
Council**]{.underline}endorsed [Minsk Agreements]{.underline}, the
fragile peace process regulating the conflict in eastern Ukraine. [One
serious problem of the UN is deeply rooted in the veto power bestowed on
the five permanent members. **Any of the Big Five can stop any
resolution unilaterally**]{.underline}.

When the UN was founded in 1945, permanent membership of the Security
Council and the veto power ensured that America and the Soviet Union had
nothing to worry about -- however undemocratic that may sound. [Due to
this veto power, **each of the Big Five could act without any fear of
reprisal from the UN**]{.underline}. Amnesty International claimed that
the five permanent members had used their veto to "promote their
political self-interest or geopolitical interest above the interest of
protecting civilians".

### Impact D/Case Turns DA\-\--2AC

#### International law that can't accommodate CDOs is [self-defeating]{.underline}\-\--collapses [stability]{.underline} and is terminally [unsustainable]{.underline}. 

NOTE: CDOs = Cyber Disinformation Operations.

Wenqing **Zhao 20**. J.D., Yale Law School, 2020; B.A., College of
William & Mary, 2017. "Cyber Disinformation Operations (CDOS) and a New
Paradigm Of Non-Intervention."
https://jilp.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/volume-27-1/27.1_ZHAO.pdf

Drawing on the observations on CDOs and existing international laws, I
offer the following possible events: (1) [current international legal
doctrines]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} UN Article 2(4)'s "[use
of force]{.underline}," the principle of nonintervention, and the
prohibition of perfidy, all [presume certain levels of aggression and
coercion]{.underline}, notions both derived from a narrative of
traditional armed conflicts and made to address measures effectuating
results similar to those achieved by armed conflicts; (2) technology and
[cyber capacity have gradually made it **unnecessary to effectuate
political results through facially aggressive or coercive means** on the
physical territory of a foreign state]{.underline}; (3) [old standards
of aggression and coercion consequently become **ill-suited to address
covert cyber operations**, leaving a **gap in international
law**]{.underline}; (4) [the twilight zone of international law in turn
**incentivizes states to exploit the gap and to engage in shady cyber
practices like CDOs**]{.underline}; (5) during this process, [CDOs that
are fraudulent and covert greatly **undermine interstate trust** because
of states' worry of asymmetrical information]{.underline}, which also
creates significant inefficiency as states engage in expensive remedial
measures of discerning and filtering disinformation; (6) [the lack of an
international consensus on cyber countermeasures]{.underline} also
[exacerbates **interstate instability** as states may adopt
over-defensive tactics that are not proportionate in scope;]{.underline}
and (7) [as]{.underline} technology and [cyber]{.underline} capacity
[continues to advance while international law lags behind,
**international peace and security will inevitably deteriorate** to the
point where the current **international laws**]{.underline}, in refusing
to adapt to the changes in cyber space, **[destroy their own primary
objectives of peace-keeping]{.underline}**.

Many of these events have already happened, as various reports cited in
Section II suggest; the rest are highly likely to happen absent an
eventbreaker of international cyber consensus adopting a new paradigm
other than "use of force," coercion, or territoriality. For instance,
the proliferation of cross-border CDOs will almost certainly ensue given
how cheap, accessible, and innocent CDOs are in comparison to
conventional military measures. CDOs will also destabilize inter-state
relationships, as they are perceived as threatening yet inconspicuous
and un-punishable under current international laws. As I have mentioned,
Russia claimed that its CDOs into other states were responding to
threats from external cyber informational activities, which are
themselves a form of CDOs. The U.S. also put forward several
presidential executive orders imposing economic sanctions through OFAC
in the event of foreign interference,139 culminating in the most
draconian one - Executive Order 13848. This Order, on top of its regular
making of SDN, also provides authority to the Secretary of the State and
the Secretary of the Treasury to sanction the largest business entities
licensed or domiciled in the interfering state in sectors of particular
"strategic significance" to that interfering state, regardless of
whether or not those business entities have engaged in foreign
interference140.

While we previously questioned the effectiveness of economic sanction
regimes, as those regimes targeting individuals and entities might be
insufficient to deter CDOs, here we have a different worry of
over-punishment when no standard of international law can provide
guidance on the proper counter responses. Targeting the largest business
entities could significantly undercut the economy of the entire
sanctioned state, which might seem to many as an unjustified
over-response to CDOs. Executive Order 13848 contains an implicit
proportionality requirement as "all recommended sanctions shall be
appropriately calibrated to the scope of the foreign interference
identified,"141 but the standard of proportionality is not discussed and
seems to be within the discretion of "appropriate agencies." Without
clearer international laws on CDOs, such discretionary countermeasures
would be one of the only few resorts for a state to seek justice.

Even if the prisoner's dilemma is overstated in the event cascade, and
that interstate stability would not be significantly undermined by the
lack of international cyber norms, it is still to states' great benefit
to start establishing international cyber norms, to provide deterrence
against cyber interference, and to commit to information integrity and
cost-effective mechanisms to mitigate the externality of cyber chaos.

[Although abiding by]{.underline} the [LOAC might appear to be a clearly
good idea]{.underline}---[better to be legal than
illegal]{.underline}---[we should not assume that it provides good
guidance for US nuclear strategy]{.underline} and, in turn, US national
security policy. [Instead, we need to consider the **implications of the
LOAC for the probability of a nuclear war**]{.underline} and the damage
that would result if war occurs. In particular, [we need to consider the
impact on **deterrence** and **crisis stability**, and on incentives for
**escalation** and **arms racing**]{.underline}. Our analysis finds that
the [LOAC provides **dangerous guidance** across **multiple dimensions
of nuclear strategy**.]{.underline}

First, depending on one's understanding of the LOAC, [the required
strategy would leave the United States with an **inadequate
deterrent**]{.underline} when facing certain types of adversaries.
Second, and more importantly, [the counterforce strategies that are
legal under the LOAC would in practice]{.underline} (if not necessarily
in theory) [help to preserve and reinforce the long-standing US emphasis
on **counterforce targeting**]{.underline}, including [supporting
**improvements in**]{.underline} its large and sophisticated
**[counterforce arsenal]{.underline}**. US nuclear doctrine includes a
spectrum of counterforce options---ranging from limited attacks intended
to deter conventional war and nuclear escalation to full-scale attacks
against nuclear forces, command and control, and leadership that are
designed to reduce the damage the adversary can inflict against the
United States and its allies.

The problem is that [a counterforce doctrine is not the United States'
best option for dealing with opposing states]{.underline} that have
deployed [large]{.underline} capable [arsenals]{.underline}, which [make
significant **damage-limitation** essentially **infeasible**. Under
these conditions, a doctrine that targets civilians and]{.underline} the
[infrastructure]{.underline} that is necessary for their survival
("**[countervalue]{.underline}** attacks" in the terminology of nuclear
strategy)9 [avoids a variety of dangers, including]{.underline}:
**[incentives to launch a massive counterforce]{.underline}** attack
**[during]{.underline}** a severe **[crisis]{.underline}** or
conventional war, [which undermines **crisis stability**; and
intensified **arms competition** with]{.underline} the United States'
majorpower nuclear competitors, **[Russia and China]{.underline}**,
[which]{.underline} unnecessarily [strains political relations and
**increases the probability of conflict**]{.underline}. In addition, [a
countervalue strategy that includes a spectrum of options]{.underline},
ranging from small attacks against isolated infrastructure targets to
large attacks against civilians, is [the **deterrent strategy** that
flows]{.underline} logically [from]{.underline} the defining feature of
[nuclear weapons]{.underline}--- their ability to inflict enormous
damage. The increasing acceptance and **[legitimacy of]{.underline}**
the **[LOAC]{.underline}** within the US government [works to preserve
the US **counterforce strategy**]{.underline} by adding another
influential argument [opposing the]{.underline} coercive [countervalue
logic of nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

Before jumping into this analysis, we raise a couple of reasons for
skepticism about applying the LOAC to nuclear strategy. The [LOAC is not
designed to]{.underline} deal with the core challenge posed by nuclear
weapons---how to **[avoid nuclear war]{.underline}**. The
[LOAC]{.underline} was developed over centuries of armed conflict and
was formalized in the 1864 Geneva Convention as well as the 1899 and
1907 Hague Conventions. It [governs]{.underline} the conduct of forces
when engaged in armed conflict (jus in bello), but [neither the decision
to go war]{.underline} (jus ad bellum), [nor the preparation for
deterring]{.underline} or fighting a [war. The purpose of the LOAC is to
**not to deter or prevent war**]{.underline}, but rather to moderate the
conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering it causes.10
[The premise is that war will occur, but that the horrors of war can be
limited through applying certain legal and ethical
principles.]{.underline}

[This would]{.underline} appear to [make]{.underline} the [LOAC less
relevant to nuclear strategy]{.underline}, for which the primary goal is
to prevent nuclear war in the first place. [The horrors of nuclear war
can be limited primarily by **deterring**]{.underline} the **[use of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}** in the first place---and, if deterrence
fails, by limiting escalation to large-scale attacks. We should not
simply assume that legal and ethical principles that were developed to
moderate the conduct of conventional conflicts would be optimal or even
suitable for deterring nuclear war and limiting escalation. Additional
skepticism is due because the logic of nuclear strategy differs
dramatically from the logic of conventional strategy.11

[More important]{.underline} than the deterrence problem
[is]{.underline} the **[counterforce]{.underline}** problem. [The
targeting policies allowed by the LOAC lend support to **dangerous US
force structures** and **nuclear strategies**]{.underline}. [This
counterforce/damage-limitation emphasis generates a variety of
well-known **dangers**]{.underline}, especially when facing another
major nuclear power, [including **reducing crisis
stability**]{.underline}---[creating]{.underline} both [real and
exaggerated incentives to **launch preemptive
attacks**]{.underline}---[and fueling **military competition** and
**straining political relations**]{.underline}.18 In other words, an
[LOAC-compliant US nuclear strategy would not just limit the US ability
to **deter nuclear conflict**]{.underline}, [but by allowing large-scale
counterforce targeting, the LOAC allows a strategy that makes **nuclear
conflict more likely through accident, miscalculation, or preemption in
a crisis**, and makes crises themselves **more likely** by **damaging US
relations with its major-power adversaries**.]{.underline}

The problem we see is that in practice the [LOAC]{.underline} will (and
[already does]{.underline}) [lend significant support to US pursuit of
large, sophisticated counterforce/damagelimitation forces. US nuclear
strategy has a long history of emphasizing large counterforce
missions]{.underline}, including pursuit of a damage-limitation
capability against the Soviet Union during the Cold War,19 and the
United States has been unwilling to foreswear the pursuit of a
damage-limitation capability against China's growing nuclear force.20
During the Cold War, the United States offered a variety of weak
arguments to explain and justify the acquisition of large counterforce
forces. These included deterring additional limited nuclear attacks,
protecting one's own forces from additional attacks, ensuring that the
adversary could not gain an advantage in a counterforce exchange, and
threatening nuclear forces because the adversary places great value on
them.21 Still more worrisome, the United States pursued
damage-limitation for decades even when its prospects were clearly
poor.22 Even though many of these specific arguments have had reduced
currency since the end of the Cold War, the US commitment to
counterforce continues and much of this is driven by pursuit of
damage-limitation capabilities. Especially given the development of
technologies that increase the prospects for making mobile forces
vulnerable,23 [it is likely that the United States will continue to
pursue the ability to destroy all of China's forces, and possibly
Russia's]{.underline}.

The **[LOAC support this outcome]{.underline}** by [presenting a simple
and appealing conclusion that proponents of counterforce forces can
employ in support of their preferred strategy]{.underline}: [with
countervalue targets prohibited, **all that is left is
counterforce**]{.underline}; and [if attacking opposing forces is all
that is permitted, the United States should do this as effectively as
possible]{.underline}. Doing anything less would leave the United States
with a weakened and possibly ineffective deterrent. [Consequently,
although a nuanced understanding of the LOAC prohibits damage-limitation
counterforce attacks against states with truly massive retaliatory
capabilities, the United States is likely to ignore this
constraint]{.underline} when policy and plans are being made. [The
result is that the **LOAC lends support to a dangerous US nuclear
strategy**]{.underline}.

[During the Obama administration, retention of substantial counterforce
capabilities was justified]{.underline} [partly by]{.underline} the
requirement that all plans must be "consistent with the fundamental
principles of the [Law of Armed Conflict]{.underline}." 24 US [nuclear
planners embraced the LOAC as justification for the pursuit of
counterforce]{.underline} and damage-limitation capabilities, especially
because the LOAC is interpreted to impose a strict ban on countervalue
retaliation. They rejected reductions to "minimum deterrent" force
levels partly because the countervalue targeting that would be required
for a small nuclear force to be an effective deterrent would be
incompatible with the LOAC. The **[LOAC is therefore a barrier to deep
reductions in nuclear arsenals]{.underline}**, which is ironic for those
who believe LOAC compliance can be achieved only through a prohibition
on nuclear weapons and who see deep reductions as an essential
waystation on the path toward nuclear disarmament.

#### We control the probability and magnitude of impacts

[Preventing Nuclear War Should **Guide Nuclear Strategy**]{.underline}

In sum, we believe that the [LOAC provides poor guidance for US nuclear
policy]{.underline}. Although intuitively appealing---because attacking
civilians would be horrible--- this appeal is misleading. [Nuclear
policies guided by the LOAC risk leaving the United States **without an
adequate deterrent** and]{.underline}, more importantly, [support force
postures that make both **nuclear war and escalation to all-out war more
likely**.]{.underline} Moreover, [a nuclear war driven by the pressures
created by large counterforce forces would likely inflict the very huge
costs to civilians]{.underline} that abiding by the LOAC seeks to avoid.

So long as [the United States]{.underline} retains nuclear weapons, it
[should rely on a strategy that meets its deterrence requirements while
minimizing incentives and pressures for nuclear use during crises, the
probability of accidents and unauthorized use, and strains in political
relations that are generated by arms races]{.underline}. In addition,
[if deterrence fails, the strategy should create incentives for the slow
and deliberate use of nuclear weapons, not impulsive, rapid, or massive
attacks. This can be achieved by a **countervalue
strategy**]{.underline} that includes a range of limited nuclear options
and little or no counterforce capability. The United States could adopt
this policy unilaterally, but cooperation with major-power nuclear
adversaries would increase both the prospects for and effectiveness of
this policy. Arms control agreements that constrain counterforce forces,
thereby reducing incentives to attack early and massively, would reduce
the probability of nuclear war and, if desirable, pave the way to
reductions in the size of states' forces. [This]{.underline} type of
agreement [would]{.underline} also [reduce the danger posed by the
targeting allowed by the LOAC]{.underline}, although the logic for
targeting nuclear forces would remain weak.

The LOAC misguides US nuclear policy. [The most ethical and moral
nuclear policy is the one that minimizes the **probability of nuclear
war and the probability as well as extent of escalation**]{.underline}
if nuclear war does occur. [This strategy is **precluded by the law of
armed conflict**.]{.underline}
