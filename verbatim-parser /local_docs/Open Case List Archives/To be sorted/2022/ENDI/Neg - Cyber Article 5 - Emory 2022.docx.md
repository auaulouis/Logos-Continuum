[[Cybersecurity defined]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Cybersecurity is [the act of implementing]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}sophisticated [**[layers of]{.mark} network defense and
[firewalls]{.mark}** []{.mark}to protect]{.underline} critical
[systems]{.underline} and sensitive information against threats from
digital attacks.

The reality is that the types and severity of cybercrime are constantly
evolving and multiplying.

- There are malware attacks such as viruses that attempt to destroy
  data.

- Ransomware is a particularly nasty type that locks down systems and
  threatens to erase data unless a ransom is paid.

- Phishing scams try to trick unsuspecting end users into giving up
  sensitive personal information such as social security (SSI) and
  credit card numbers to sell on the dark web.

- There are Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that overwhelm
  a website with traffic.

- Man-in-the-Middle attacks involve hackers trying to intercept messages
  between two parties to steal company data.

- And not all threats are external. Current or former employees with a
  grudge and intimate network knowledge can wreak havoc on a business
  from behind the firewall. Companies must be on the lookout for
  cybercrime from all directions.

[[Cybersecurity]{.mark} solutions]{.underline}, therefore, [are
applications, measures, and devices that]{.underline} constantly
**[monitor network traffic]{.underline}** for suspicious activity. [Upon
detecting a threat, it **[isolates and quarantines affected
files]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}and devices, [and]{.underline}
immediately **[alerts IT]{.underline}** staff as to the exact location
and proper response to the breach, [**[limiting its
impact]{.underline}**]{.mark} and assisting with recovery.

**[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[**deterrence by denial** is]{.mark}
essentially [synonymous to **cybersecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At
its core, [[the conceptual idea is]{.mark} that better **cybersecurity

[**[network penetration]{.mark}**, and thus influence the cost-benefit
calculations of an adversary to the degree that it either disincentives
an attack or grinds an attacker to halt over time]{.underline}.
**[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**deterrence by
[punishment]{.mark}** [seeks to discourage the
adversary]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}from attacking,
[recognizing]{.underline} the costly [consequences]{.underline}
following their actions outweigh the benefits. We have seen variations
of this logic being proposed as well. According to Lucas Kello, instead
of trying to deter individual acts, countries should go for punctuated
deterrence: "a series of actions that generate cumulative effect, rather
than tit for tat response".Footnote35 **[[Third]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[**deterrence by entanglement** rests on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
unresolved discussion in international relations theory on whether
state-to-state [[interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark} mitigates

creation of [[norms]{.underline}]{.mark} and rules for state behaviour
in cyberspace, will over time translate into a general principle of
restraint, raise the reputational costs of bad behaviour, and shrink the
battlespace to only encompass military combatants.

[Cybersecurity operations protect]{.underline} United States government
computer [networks]{.underline}. **[By contrast, offensive cyber
operations seek to penetrate enemy cyberspace]{.underline}** and, at
times, to impair adversaries' hardware and critical physical
infrastructure.25 The Joint Chiefs of Staff note that all cyber
operations conducted outside of "blue cyberspace"---areas in cyberspace
protected by the government and its mission partners---are classified as
offensive cyber operations.26 Therefore, causing kinetic damage is not a
necessary criteria for a cyber operation to be considered offensive in
nature. In fact, much offensive cyber activity carried out by the DOD
and the intelligence community consists of efforts to gather
intelligence, with no intent to cause immediate physical or functional
damage to adversaries' computer systems or infrastructure. These types
of nondestructive offensive cyber operations are referred to as "cyber
exploitation" and constitute the primary activity of defense contractors
operating in the offensive cyber market.

#### They are [distinct fields]{.underline}.

This article argues that structural economic [differences in **three
distinct cyber markets**]{.underline}---**[cybersecurity, offensive
cyber operations, and data analytics]{.underline}**---[have **important
implications**]{.underline} for the quality of outsourcing carried out
by United States defense and intelligence agencies. In the
[cybersecurity]{.underline} market, which [has existed for over 20
years]{.underline}, contracting is relatively efficient. The market is
characterized by numerous suppliers, and government agencies possess
detailed information about corporations' capabilities and past
performances. [**By contrast**, the emerging market for **offensive
cyber operations** has a small number of suppliers]{.underline}, and the
tools companies develop for offensive cyber missions have limited
utility outside national security settings. These two factors are likely
to lead to an inefficient market in which government agencies are highly
dependent on contractors. Finally, the market for "big data"
analytics---which involve collection, analysis, and visualization of
information using algorithms---is relatively new. Thus, the Department
of Defense (DOD) and intelligence community have little experience
assessing the capabilities of competing firms. This feature of the
analytics market means that government agencies are more likely to make
suboptimal choices when assessing the relative capabilities of companies
in the field. However, the competitive nature of the analytics market
coupled with the wide applicability of analytics products outside
defense-specific settings suggests that assessment and oversight of
firms will become more efficient as information about companies
increases through repeated contracting.

But despite this rhetoric, exactly how and when Article 5 applies to
cyberspace remains unclear. This ambiguity is a problem --- with
potentially disastrous consequences. [Staking the **credibility of
Article 5** to]{.underline} what are often [murky activities in
cyberspace threatens to **undermine**]{.underline} the broader principle
of **[collective defense]{.underline}**. [We can't risk **fracturing
the**]{.underline} transatlantic **[alliance]{.underline}** at a
critical juncture in its history over a debate [on what constitutes
a]{.underline} major or [minor cyberattack]{.underline}. For that
reason, NATO should move quickly to clarify its policy on cyberattacks
and explicitly state the threshold for what would trigger an Article 5
response. Furthermore, [NATO]{.underline} members [should commit to
treating cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of a major attack as
a **national matter**]{.underline} --- **[not one for the
alliance]{.underline}**.

This equivocation is not surprising, for several reasons. [The nature of
**cyberspace**]{.underline} often **[confounds unequivocal deterrence
declarations.]{.underline}** [States tend to operate in cyberspace with
**plausible deniability**]{.underline}, [which can make it difficult to
rapidly ascertain responsibility for cyber incidents]{.underline}. Also,
[it can be challenging to understand the intent behind observed cyber
behavior, and there is often a substantial time lag between when an
initial penetration of a network occurs and when the target even
realizes the breach]{.underline}. And [the vast majority of cyber
operations cause virtual, not physical, damage, complicating efforts to
assess and evaluate the implications]{.underline} of the costs
inflicted. [Moreover, it can take time to develop and identify a way to
infiltrate a network as well as the computer code that takes advantage
of a vulnerability for malicious ends. This means states may **lack a
palatable cyber response option** for retaliatory purposes at the
desired time]{.underline}.

[This creates a]{.underline} [**slew of practical problems if Article 5
were to be invoked** for a cyberattack]{.underline}. From an
implementation perspective, [it would trigger deliberations
within]{.underline} the North Atlantic Council, [NATO's]{.underline}
primary [decision-making body. Decisions]{.underline} made within the
NAC [require **unanimity**, which can be difficult to
achieve]{.underline} for many issues but is **[especially burdensome for
cyber ones]{.underline}**, given all of the ambiguities outlined above.
[The most likely outcome of this process would be a **long, drawn-out
deliberation** resulting in a **divided alliance**]{.underline} unable
to agree on how or whether to respond. Quite simply, **[some allies are
unlikely to want to risk World War III]{.underline}** for a cyberattack
that disrupts the financial infrastructure, for instance, of another
country but doesn't lead to loss of life or sustained damage.

These challenges have major strategic implications for NATO. After years
of publicly and repeatedly linking Article 5 to cyberspace and
reinforcing that policy in response to the Ukraine conflict, [a failure
to achieve consensus and respond]{.underline} to a Russian cyberattack
against a NATO member [could **imperil Article 5 in other
areas**]{.underline}. The [disunity that is likely to be revealed during
NAC deliberations would]{.underline} then [**undermine the broader
political cohesion** that has]{.underline}, for the most part, [been
**remarkably strong**]{.underline} throughout the war in Ukraine. [This
would make it more difficult for the alliance to respond to **other
forms of Russian behavior**]{.underline}. As Biden emphasized at a press
conference last month, "the single-most important thing is for us to
stay unified ... We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly unified."

NATO has achieved some strategic ambiguity with its current cyber
policy, which may help to deter high-stakes Russian assaults during the
present crisis. However, rather than an all-out Russian cyberattack, a
far more plausible scenario is a lower-level attack carried out by the
Russian government or a proxy group against one or more allies. In this
case, the [alliance's interests]{.underline} --- not to mention
transatlantic security --- [would be better served by]{.underline}
adopting [nationally-tailored responses **rather than pulling the
Article 5 lever**]{.underline}. Additionally, to prevent further
escalation and reinforce the implicit firebreak that currently exists
between cyber and conventional military operations, NATO allies should
also agree to restrict any retaliatory response against Moscow to the
cyber realm or non-military instruments of power.

29\. [NATO maintains a cyber deterrence policy of
**ambiguity**]{.underline}. First, [it does not draw a clear line for
when a cyber attack is sufficiently harmful to cross the threshold to an
armed attack]{.underline}. Second, it does not currently have an
operational definition of what the collective response would be if that
threshold were to be crossed. [Such a cyber deterrence policy offers
**several advantages**. If the Alliance were to set a clear threshold,
the opponent would]{.underline} better [understand how to **stay below
that threshold**. This would]{.underline} strengthen deterrence of
threats above the threshold but would **[encourage the opponent to
increase attacks just below the threshold]{.underline}**. A certain
degree of **[ambiguity is beneficial]{.underline}** because [it could
make opponents **wary of going too far** in their cyber attacks. The

**prefers to tread lightly**. A similar deterrence posture]{.underline}

[Cyber deterrence is **inherently more challenging** than nuclear or
conventional deterrence because such attacks are **difficult to
definitively attribute**]{.underline} to a particular actor. For
example, [it is easier to **mask the source of a
cyberattack**]{.underline} on a power grid than it would have been for
the Warsaw Pact to conceal a massive incursion into West Germany. [This
**attribution problem** could complicate NATO's capacity to conclusively
determine the source of a cyberattack and justify and conduct a timely
conventional response, particularly if **member states diverge in their
perceptions**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} dilemma [could **strain
the foundations of collective defense** and **undermine any unified
front** against cyberattacks.]{.underline}

[For NATO]{.underline} to commit to military action,
**[all]{.underline}** of its **[members would need
certainty]{.underline}**, beyond a reasonable doubt, [about the identity
of the perpetrator]{.underline}. This is particularly true in the case
of Russia---a known sponsor of cyberattacks. [**Without conclusive
proof**, it might be a challenge to convince a distant country like
Portugal or]{.underline} a dangerously close one like [Estonia to
join]{.underline} in a counterattack. [Complicating matters, such
post-attack decisions would need to be made quickly]{.underline}, given
Russia's precedent of using cyberwarfare as a precursor to kinetic
invasion. The need for speed leaves little room for philosophical

These [predictions suggest]{.underline} that [cyber operations will
provide significant strategic advantages to Russia]{.underline} either
as complements to military force, or as standalone instruments --- or at
least that policymakers and commentators think that they will. Current
[warnings of **escalating cyber warfare** conjure]{.underline}
deep-seated [fears of cyber doom and]{.underline} the recurring specter
of a "**[cyber Pearl Harbor]{.underline}**" strategic surprise attack.
[In practice]{.underline}, however, **[cyber warfare has been a
failure]{.underline}**. Our [research shows that **cyber
operations**]{.underline} have **[remained irrelevant on the
battlefield]{.underline}**, while standalone operations to weaken
Ukraine through [**election interference**, **critical infrastructure
sabotage**, and **economic disruption** largely **failed** to contribute
to Russia's strategic goals of making Ukraine abandon its pro-European
Union and pro-NATO foreign policy]{.underline}. Consequently, [current
fears of cyber warfare defy not only **Russia's track
record**]{.underline} in Ukraine, **[but also]{.underline}** strategic
**[logic]{.underline}**. [Given that Russia's cyber operations have
**failed**]{.underline} to produce significant strategic value to date,
[why would we expect this to]{.underline} suddenly [change]{.underline}
now? Or, to put it more pointedly: [If cyber operations offer such
effective and potent instruments, why did Russia go through
the]{.underline} trouble (and [costs]{.underline}) [to mobilize its
troops?]{.underline} Current **[predictions of cyber onslaught do not
offer a persuasive answer]{.underline}**.

Giving in to [these fears risks]{.underline} fighting [phantom threats,
playing into Russia's hands]{.underline} by [distracting from
the]{.underline} need to counter its [military threat and sowing fear
and confusion]{.underline} --- at least among Western audiences. A
level-headed [analysis of]{.underline} the threat that distinguishes
what is theoretically possible from [what is practically feasible
is]{.underline} urgently [needed]{.underline}. Our research suggests
that, [contrary to hysteria, **cyber operations** will remain of
**secondary importance** and at best provide **marginal gains** to
Russia.]{.underline}

Expectations Versus Evidence: Cyber Operations and Their Limits

There are three distinct perspectives on the strategic role and value of
cyber operations in conflict. [Early scholarship]{.underline} on cyber
conflict [expected cyber operations to be primarily important in
conventional military conflict]{.underline}, enabling crippling
strategic strikes analogous to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor
during World War II. If successful, cyber operations could thus be
substituted for the use of force. Yet [research throughout the 2010s
made the **limitations of cyber operations** as a means of force
projection increasingly clear.]{.underline}

Subsequent scholarship thus sees cyber operations primarily as
complements to force. Possible effects include disrupting command and
control and communications systems, sabotaging equipment and
infrastructure, spreading disinformation, and conducting psychological
warfare to undermine morale among enemy troops.

The third and increasingly influential perspective instead suggests
cyber operations are primarily relevant in "gray zone" conflict short of
war. In this view, cyber operations offer standalone instruments of
power that can influence and weaken an adversary through critical
infrastructure sabotage, economic disruption, and influence operations.
Hence, as in cyber Pearl Harbor scenarios, it also suggests that cyber
operations could substitute for the use of force --- achieving similar
goals without going to war. However, rather than through a massive
surprise strike, this third school of thought expects the effects to be
gradual and cumulative, eroding adversary strength over multiple
operations.

[The empirical record of cyber conflict]{.underline}, however, [suggests
that what is feasible in practice is **far more limited**]{.underline}.
Ukraine has been a "giant test lab" where [Russia]{.underline}, one of
the world's foremost cyber powers, has experimented with cyber
operations for eight years. Yet these [operations have **failed to
produce significant strategic value** either as force complements or
standalone tools.]{.underline}

The substitutability argument --- that states can or do substitute cyber
operations for the use of force --- has little empirical support since
[Russia levied no major cyber operations against Ukraine in the runup to
the military escalation of the conflict in 2014.]{.underline} While it
is possible that we do not know about such operations given their veil
of secrecy, it is clear that [any attempted but undetected cyber
surprise strike **failed** to produce any **measurable
effects**.]{.underline}

[Evidence supporting the complementarity perspective is similarly
sobering]{.underline}. One of us has examined the role of low-level
disruptive cyber operations in the military conflict and their relevance
for battlefield events (and outcomes). Disruptive attacks can directly
affect military operations as they seek to sabotage an opponent's
ability to fight. For example, the Russia-backed separatists in the
Donbas and Luhansk regions used malware to retrieve data from mobile
devices on the locations of Ukrainian artillery troops, facilitating
better reconnaissance against these troops. Pro-Ukrainian hackers
hijacked CCTV cameras behind enemy lines to obtain intelligence on the
movement of Russian artillery in the separatist-controlled territories.

[Focusing on the period of the most intense fighting]{.underline},
between 2014 and 2016 --- the time when, if cyber tools are an effective
complement to armed force, Russia would have been most likely to use
them --- [we applied a series of statistical tests to **thousands of
cyber and military operations**]{.underline}. [The findings
showed]{.underline} a strong, escalatory dynamic between military
operations by both sides but **[no significant
correlation]{.underline}** in either direction [**between military and
cyber operations**, and no reciprocity between cyber operations. This
evidence demonstrates]{.underline} that in one of the first armed
conflicts where both sides used low-level cyber operations extensively,
[digital operations unfolded independently from the events on the ground
and had **no discernible effect**]{.underline} on them. Hence, [in stark
contrast to expectations about the force-multiplying
advantages]{.underline} of cyber operations, these [findings suggest
hacking groups faced **considerable difficulties** in responding to
battlefield events, much less shaping them.]{.underline}

Finally, [the track record of cyber operations]{.underline} as
standalone instruments in gray zone conflict [in Ukraine]{.underline}
also [falls far short of expectations. One of us]{.underline} has
[examined]{.underline} the [operational]{.underline} mechanisms,
[effects]{.underline}, and strategic value [of]{.underline} five major
Russia-sponsored cyber operations, including [election interference,
critical infrastructure sabotage, and economic disruption]{.underline}.
Contrary to prevailing expectations, [the majority made **no measurable
contribution towards Russia's**]{.underline} strategic
**[goals]{.underline}**. The [NotPetya]{.underline} operation, whose
large-scale disruption of businesses wiped off half a percentage point
of Ukraine's gross domestic product in 2017, [is the
exception]{.underline}. Yet [this]{.underline} operation [underlined a
key **shortcoming** of cyber operations: the risk of losing
control]{.underline} over the spread of effects, [producing unintended
consequences, added costs, and]{.underline} correspondingly **[lowering
strategic value]{.underline}**. Forensic analysis by internet security
company ESET revealed that the Sandworm [hacking]{.underline} group
underestimated how far NotPetya's data-destroying malware would spread.
It "went out of control" and spread far beyond Ukraine, even [disrupting
targets in Russia]{.underline} --- including the state-controlled oil
giant Rosneft. These disruptions within Russia will have caused
additional costs, as did the sanctions that Western countries imposed on
Russia in response to NotPetya's international disruption.

[Evidence]{.underline} from Ukraine [thus supports **neither the force
substitute nor the force complement argument**]{.underline}. Instead,
[cyber operations have been]{.underline} most relevant as standalone,
[lower-intensity]{.underline} alternatives to the use of force --- more
in line with the third school of thought. Yet [by and large they **fell
short of providing measurable strategic value**]{.underline}. Indeed,
[all]{.underline} available [evidence indicates that Russia's cyber
warfare efforts against Ukraine]{.underline} --- combined with its
larger gray zone campaign --- have [**failed** to make Ukraine abandon
its rapprochement with the West]{.underline}. That is why Russia has

Western alliance through threat of invasion.

Plausible Threats in the Conflict Ahead

[Considering the underwhelming track record of cyber warfare in
Ukraine]{.underline} to date, [there is little reason to expect cyber
doom of the kind that some now predict]{.underline}. For these warnings
of a Russian cyber onslaught to become reality, cyber operations would
need to produce effects at a scope and scale that they have previously
failed to attain. Importantly, current warnings fail to make a
persuasive case on why we should expect such a transformation.

Rather, they rest on the implicit assumption that with the change in
strategic context, the role of cyber operations will change as well.
This comes out clearest in Maggie Miller's recent commentary suggesting
that military escalation in Ukraine would finally herald "a true
cyberwar" where Russia could "take down the power grid" or launch a
disinformation campaign to undermine the government in Kyiv. Dmitri
Alperovitch offers a more level-headed analysis, underlining that cyber
operations alone will fall short of achieving Russia's goals. However,
he also suggests that they can complement force as an "extension of
warfare itself," disrupting command and control to provide battlefield
advantages, sabotaging critical infrastructure, and undermining public
trust in the government to "send a powerful signal that resistance is
futile." Yet, as we have seen, [Russia has attempted most]{.underline}
of these [objectives in the past and has **failed**]{.underline}. Even
in a full-scale invasion, we have the same aggressor, with the same
hacking groups, with the same skill level going after the same sets of
possible targets. Why would we expect different results?

Changing the strategic context of deployment does not change the
mechanism of action that cyber operations rely upon to produce outcomes
--- and its intrinsic constraints. Cyber operations rely on a mechanism
of subversion that exploits vulnerabilities in adversary systems to use
them against the adversary. This mechanism holds great strategic promise
but poses significant operational challenges. It requires creativity and
cunning to remotely manipulating complex systems that others designed
and operate without alerting the victim to one's presence. These
challenges produce an operational trilemma between the speed, intensity
of effects, and level of control that actors have over these effects.
This trilemma limits strategic value, since [in most circumstances cyber
operations will be **too slow**, **too weak**, and **too volatile** to
contribute measurably to strategic goals]{.underline}. The constraining
role of this trilemma is evident across all five of Russia's disruptive
cyber operations against Ukraine thus far, underlining their relevance.
Importantly, [all available evidence indicates that]{.underline} these
[**intrinsic constraints** limit the strategic value of cyber operations
regardless of strategic contexts]{.underline}.

4\. [The Alliance]{.underline} first [publicly recognised the need to
strengthen cyber security and defence]{.underline} at the 2002 Prague
Summit. [In 2008, NATO adopted its first cyber defence
policy]{.underline}. However, [the crucial turning point came in
2014]{.underline} at the Wales Summit, when [the Alliance adopted an
Enhanced NATO Cyber Defence Policy]{.underline}. Among other key
decisions, **[NATO leaders explicitly stated a cyber attack could lead

[Allied leaders made clear that "\[c\]yber attacks can reach a threshold
that threatens national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security, and
stability"]{.underline} (NATO, 2014).

5\. Since the Wales Summit, [NATO and the Allies have made cyber
security, defence, and deterrence an unambiguous part of NATO\'s core
tasks]{.underline} and implemented the steps to make this a reality. By
now, [**any potential opponent should have realised** that a
**sufficiently harmful cyber attack** against one Ally will be
considered an armed attack against all and that Allies **will invoke
Article 5 to collectively defend themselves**]{.underline}. [At the 2018
NATO Summit]{.underline} in Brussels, [Allied leaders once again
reiterated this commitment: "Reaffirming NATO's defensive mandate, we
are determined to employ the full range of capabilities, including
cyber, to deter, defend against, and to counter the full spectrum of
cyber threats, including those conducted as part of a hybrid

First, there are a number of flaws in the militarisation of the cyber
domain. The majority of those with the necessary technical skills to
respond to the cyber security challenges work outside of the military
sector. In addition, [a large proportion of the infrastructure within
the cyber domain is **privately owned and operated**. This **prevents
NATO** from making a substantial contribution]{.underline} to its
protection. Crucially, [NATO does **not have any rights**]{.underline},
or powers, **[to intervene in the private sector]{.underline}**. Given
NATO's current lack of expertise in the area, [private sector firms are
**unlikely to welcome NATO** assistance]{.underline}.

#### \[[IF APPLICABLE]{.mark}\] 8\-\--No democracy impact\-\--democratic peace theory is wrong 

Daniel **Larison 12**. PhD in history from the University of Chicago
Democratic Peace Theory Is False
http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/democratic-peace-theory-is-false/

Rojas' claim depends entirely on the meaning of "genuine democracy."
Even though there are numerous examples of wars between states with
universal male suffrage and elected governments (including that little
dust-up known as WWI), the states in question probably don't qualify as
"genuine" democracies and so can't be used as counter-examples.
Regardless, [democratic peace theory draws **broad conclusions from a
short period** in modern history with very few cases before the 20th
century. The core of democratic peace theory]{.underline} as I
understand it is that democratic governments are more accountable to
their populations, and because the people will bear the costs of the war
they are going to be less willing to support a war policy. This
supposedly keeps democratic states from waging wars against one another
because of the built-in electoral and institutional checks on government
power. One small problem with this is that it **[is
rubbish]{.underline}**.

[**Democracies in antiquity fought against one another**. Political
equality and voting do not abolish conflicts]{.underline} of interest
between competing states. [Democratic peace theory doesn't account for
the effects of **nationalist and imperialist ideologies**]{.underline}
on the way democratic nations think about war. [Democratic nations that
have professional armies to do the fighting for them are often
enthusiastic about overseas wars. The Conservative-Unionist government
that waged the South African War]{.underline} (against two states with
elected governments, I might add) [enjoyed great popular support and won
a huge majority in the "Khaki" election that followed]{.underline}.

As long as it goes well and doesn't have too many costs, [**war can be
quite popular**, and even if the war is costly it may still be popular
if it is fought for nationalist reasons that appeal to a majority of the
public]{.underline}. If the public is whipped into thinking that there
is an intolerable foreign threat or if they believe that their country
can gain something at relatively low cost by going to war, the type of
government they have really is irrelevant. Unless a democratic public
believes that a military conflict will go badly for their military, they
may be ready to welcome the outbreak of a war that they expect to win.
[Setting aside the flaws and failures of U.S.-led democracy promotion
for a moment, the idea that reducing the number of non-democracies makes
war less likely is **just fantasy**. Clashing interests between states
aren't going away, and the more democratic states there are in the world
the more likely it is that two or more of them will **eventually fight
one another**.]{.underline}

More important, [the nationalist prospect was and remains **hopelessly
impractical**]{.underline}. In the world today, there are 6,800
different dialects or languages that might gain political recognition as
independent linguistic groups. [Does anyone seriously suggest that the
200 or so existing states should each, on average, be cut into 34
pieces? The doctrine of national self-determination reaches its
**reductio ad absurdum** at this point.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the one-nation, one-state principle is unlikely to prevail
for four good reasons. First, [governments today are more responsive to
their ethnic minority communities]{.underline} than were the imperial
agglomerations of yesteryear, [and they]{.underline} also [have more
resources at their disposal]{.underline} than their predecessors did.
[Many provinces populated by discontented ethnic groups are located in
territories **adjacent to national capitals, not
overseas**]{.underline}. And many governments in this era of
globalization have annual budgets equivalent to nearly 50 percent of
their GDPs, much of which is spent on social services.
[They]{.underline} can \-- and do \-- [accommodate the economic needs of
their states\' differentiated units. They]{.underline} also [respond to
those units\' linguistic requests. Basques, Bretons, Punjabis,
Québecois, and Scots **live quite well inside the bonds of multinational
sovereignty** and in some cases **better than residents of other
provinces** with no claims of being a distinct nation.]{.underline}

Second, the achievement of [separate sovereignty]{.underline} today
[depends on]{.underline} external recognition and [support. Prospective
new states cannot gain independence without military assistance and
economic aid]{.underline} from abroad. International recognition, in
turn, requires the aspiring nationalist movement to avoid international
terrorism as a means of gaining attention. If a separatist group uses
terrorism, it tends to be reviled and sidelined. [If an ethnic group
does not have enough support to win independence by peaceful electoral
means inside its country, its resorting to terrorism **only calls into
question the legitimacy of its quest for independence**.]{.underline}

Recognizing this, the [Québecois abandoned the terrorist
methods]{.underline} of the Quebec Liberation Front. Most Basques
castigate Basque Homeland and Freedom (known by its Basque acronym ETA).
Enlightened [Europeans have withdrawn their support for the Chechen
rebels]{.underline}. And the continued terrorist shelling of Israeli
cities from a Hamas-dominated Gaza might undermine the previous
international consensus in favor of a two-state solution to the
Palestinian problem, or at least warrant an exceptional approach to
Gaza.

With the possible exception of the Palestinians, [the notion that any of
these peoples would be better off in smaller and weaker independent
states in a hostile neighborhood is **unrealistic**]{.underline}.
Occasionally, dissidents make the case that if they were to leave the
state unit, they would be taken into the comforting embrace of the
European Union or the North American Free Trade Agreement, thereby
gaining access to a large market. But that would depend a great deal on
outsider support for their cause. [The United Kingdom might not wish to
see Scotland in the EU]{.underline} and would be in a position to veto
its membership. The United States and Canada might not agree to let an
independent Quebec join NAFTA. The belief that when a tiny nation is
born it falls automatically into the loving hands of international
midwives is questionable. The truth varies from case to case.

Third, although globalization initially stimulated ethnic discontent by
creating inequality, it also provides the means for quieting discontents
down the road within the fold of the state political system. Distributed
economic growth is a palliative for political discontent. Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand contain different ethnic groups that
have largely profited from the intense economic resurgence of their
states stimulated by globalization. Northern and southern Vietnam are
culturally different, but both have benefited from the country\'s
economic growth. Cambodia has a diverse population, but it has gained
greatly from China\'s move to externalize some of its production.

Fourth, [a discontented population]{.underline} may react to ethnic
discrimination, but it also [responds to economic need, and whatever its
concerns, it does not always have to seek independence to alleviate
them. It has **another safety valve**]{.underline}:
**[emigration]{.underline}** to another country. The state of [Monterrey
has not sought independence from Mexico; rather, many of its inhabitants
have **moved**]{.underline}, legally or illegally, to the United States.
[The huge emigration from the Maghreb to France and Italy reflects a
similar attitude and outcome]{.underline}; the dissatisfied populations
of North Africa can find greater welfare in Europe. And [when Poles move
to France or the United Kingdom, they do not secede from the mother
country but demonstrate greater satisfaction with French or British
rule]{.underline}. **[Emigration is the overwhelming alternative to
secession]{.underline}** when the home government does not sufficiently
mitigate economic disparities.

Even where the [central government]{.underline} has used force to
[suppress secessionist movements]{.underline}, it has [offered
**carrots**]{.underline} at the same time that it has yielded sticks.
The province of [Aceh has been coaxed]{.underline}, even as it has been
subjected to threats, [to remain inside the Indonesian republic.
Kashmir]{.underline}, facing a balance of restraints and incentives, [is
unlikely to emerge as an independent state in India. And the Tamil
Tigers have lost the sympathy of the world by their slaughter of
innocent Sinhalese.]{.underline}

The recent formation of [an \"independent\" Kosovo]{.underline}, which
has not yet been recognized by various key countries, [does not foretell
the similar arrival of other new states]{.underline}. **[It is unlikely
that Abkhazia or South Ossetia]{.underline}**, although largely
autonomous in fact, **[will gain full and formal independence from
Georgia or that the Albanian areas of Macedonia will
secede]{.underline}**. Rather, [prospective secessionists, dissuaded by
both central governments and the international community, are **likely
to hold back**]{.underline}. Indeed, the [most plausible future outcome
is that both established states and their international supporters will
generally act to **prevent a proliferation of new states** from entering
the international system.]{.underline}

**[NATO is a headless chicken.]{.underline}** It has been reduced into
[an insignificant entity which when told to shut up by Russia, goes to a
corner and quietly sits down]{.underline} -- making sure to behave
itself. [It is quite remarkable how Ukraine thought this organisation
would come to its aid]{.underline} in the event of a large-scale Russian
invasion. Leave alone military aid, **[NATO has not even been able to
agree on a decisive economic sanctions package]{.underline}** that would
have an immediate effect on Moscow.

Russia has invaded Ukraine. The world is outraged. The United States and
its allies are angry. NATO is infuriated. But here's the ridiculously
painful part: **[NATO can do nothing but mutely spectate]{.underline}**
as Russian President Vladimir Putin redefines Eastern Europe.
Essentially, **[NATO has failed]{.underline}**. It had one mandate -- to
protect Europe. [It has failed to achieve its primary objective, and
this would have lasting consequences for the security
alliance.]{.underline}

U.S.-led NATO a Failure

[NATO is]{.underline} an expensive yet **[useless]{.underline}**
organisation that American taxpayers fund. The United States pays to
keep Europe "safe". But Europe buys billions of dollars worth of gas
from Russia. So, Joe Biden refuses to sanction Russia's energy sector.

On Thursday, Joe Biden announced a set of sweeping sanctions against
Russia and Moscow's elite. Biden said his administration would stunt the
Russian military's ability to finance and grow its force; freeze U.S.
assets held by Russian banks; target elites and members of Putin's inner
circle, and curtail Russia's high-tech imports.

But Biden left out Russia's energy sector -- which in a way, pretty much
bankrolls Russia's economy. Because the Biden administration and NATO
merely want to appear to be taking on Russia. They don't want to
antagonise Moscow.

What else explains European countries -- led by the likes of Italy,
Germany and others vetoing a proposal to ban Russia from using the SWIFT
global interbank payments system? You see, data from the Bank of
International Settlements (BIS) shows that European lenders hold the
lion's share of the nearly \$30 billion in foreign banks' exposure to
Russia.

Late on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr [Zelensky]{.underline}
couldn't keep it to himself any longer. So, in an address to Ukrainians,
he lambasted European countries and other Western powers for making
false promises.

He said, "I have [asked 27 European leaders whether Ukraine will be in
NATO... Everyone is afraid, no one answers]{.underline}." NATO has
abandoned Ukraine. Europe -- which until recently referred to Ukraine as
a compatriot, has failed to provide any substantial and meaningful aid
to the country that is being invaded.

Ukraine, by Zelensky's admission, is all alone. NATO is nowhere to be
seen, and the United States is imposing convenient sanctions against
Russia which Moscow has grown immune against.

[NATO Will Cease to Exist]{.underline}

The invasion of Ukraine has shown that [**Europe is not united**. Every
European country is keeping its interests above the supposed idea of
protecting 'Europe' as a whole. There is **no cohesion**]{.underline}
among European nations, and Joe Biden's administration remains simply
clueless.

The United Kingdom, meanwhile, is thanking its stars that it left Europe
at the right time. But the larger message that this fiasco has sent out
has not been lost on any country. Now, [every European country knows
that **NATO**]{.underline} -- for all purposes -- **[is a toothless
organisation]{.underline}**.

[The crisis in Eastern Europe will lay the foundation for the
**disintegration and ultimate evaporation of NATO**.]{.underline}

[The EU cyber defence capabilities report took stock of the **current
cybersecurity framework**]{.underline} in the EU [and outlined **several
gaps**]{.underline}, [ranging from]{.underline} the need to intensify
cooperation between the [member states to]{.underline} increasing
collaboration with **[NATO]{.underline}**.

The main goal is "to strengthen cyber resilience and develop common
cyber security and defence capabilities to respond to these kinds of
security challenges," said Renew Europe MEP Urmas Paet, who authored the
report.

Hybrid Threats and Collective Defence

The report also said that [the EU is increasingly involved in "hybrid
conflicts]{.underline} with its adversaries," notably China, North
Korea, and Russia.

"**[The picture could not be any clearer]{.underline}**, for state
actors' hostile to the EU, like Russia, [the cost for attacks is
infinitely smaller than the rewards]{.underline}, and that has to
change," centrist MEP Barry Andrews said.

[Parliament considered these hybrid conflicts to be particularly
dangerous]{.underline} and destabilising for democracies, as they blur
the line between war and peace through cyber-enabled disinformation
campaigns or targeting digital service providers and critical
infrastructure.

However, these **[attacks are not severe enough to
trigger]{.underline}** the collective defence clauses under **[Article 5
of]{.underline}** the **[NATO]{.underline}** treaty or the defence and
solidarity clauses under the treaties of the EU.

[To tackle this **legal vacuum**]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
parliamentary [report stressed]{.underline} that the provisions for
[**collective defence in the EU treaties** should be
reinterpreted]{.underline} to allow for voluntary collective
countermeasures.

"[This is the **only effective means** to counter the paralysis in
reacting to hybrid threats]{.underline}," the report reads.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the [Biden]{.underline}
administration [has escalated warnings about likely Russian
cyber-attacks]{.underline} on American infrastructure and business. More
worrying still, **[cyber alarmists]{.underline}** like Senate
Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., [have suggested that
cyber-attacks]{.underline} from the Kremlin [could be acts of war that
trigger NATO's collective defense.]{.underline}

**[This sky-is-falling delusion,]{.underline}** particularly from
leaders with access to classified intelligence, [is]{.underline} at best
[**counterproductive** and]{.underline} at worst
**[dangerous]{.underline}**.

[Cyber-attacks are rarely acts of war]{.underline}, and **[treating them
as if they are undermines NATO's ability to deal with real
threats]{.underline}** short of cyber war.

NATO has only invoked Article 5 -- which triggers a collective response
-- once and that was after the 9/11 attacks.

[Cyber-attacks are unlikely to destroy buildings and kill
thousands]{.underline} in an instant. [While collective defense extends
to cyberspace, **few operations could realistically be a cause for
war**]{.underline}.

This would include [cyber-attacks resulting in death or
damage]{.underline} like traditional military operations or coordinated
assaults that take the power grid or entire economic sectors offline.
These scenarios **[are unlikely]{.underline}** though: [such attacks
require far too much time, funding, manpower, and control]{.underline}.
Instead, [most attacks temporarily overwhelm servers with traffic, deny
network access, hold computers hostage, and steal or delete
data.]{.underline}

[Even if allies wanted to trigger Article 5 over cyber]{.underline}
operations, **[disagreements about the definitions]{.underline}** of
threats, **[origins]{.underline}** of attacks, **[and pain
thresholds]{.underline}** in cyberspace can **[derail the
process]{.underline}**.

[Collective retaliation requires a **unanimous vote**]{.underline}
across NATO; **[building unity]{.underline}** across these points
**[is]{.underline}** nearly **[impossible for]{.underline}** most
**[cyber activity]{.underline}**. Unlike missile attacks or tanks in the

cybercrime, cyber espionage, and cyber disruption from digital acts of
war.

#### Threshold probing [collapses the alliances]{.underline}\-\--allies will be choosing between [NATO cred]{.underline} and [internal interests]{.underline}.

Cyber Threat\". National Interest. 7-2-2010.
https://nationalinterest.org/commentary/natos-cyber-threat-3590

That seems reasonable enough and is certainly a matter that deserves
discussion within NATO. Indeed, I have it on good authority, it's in
fact being discussed frequently. But, [while it makes sense for the
allies to draw up contingency plans and reinforce their cooperation and
capabilities]{.underline} in this burgeoning arena, [we should **stop
short of formally declaring what precise set of circumstances would
allow Article 5 to be invoked**.]{.underline}

First, [doing so would put the members in a **bind**. A cyber attack
might technically meet the theoretical]{.underline} definition put forth
in advance [without]{.underline} the actual circumstances [generating
consensus]{.underline} for any number of reasons. Perhaps the aggrieved
party will be perceived to have provoked the attack by
belligerence---belligerence that would actually be encouraged by an a
priori declaration of support.

Or [perhaps the risks of retaliation simply outweigh]{.underline} the
damage done by the attack because of complicating circumstances. This is
hardly unthinkable given that the most probable nation-state aggressors
are Russia and China.

Regardless, the [allies would then be forced to choose between the
credibility of NATO and their own short-term interests. It's an
**untenable position**]{.underline} far more **[likely to harm the
alliance]{.underline}** and its members than to ward off the cyber
threat.

Second, [there's tremendous value in **strategic
ambiguity**]{.underline}. This was commonly understood during the Cold
War, when the United States refused to declare that it would not engage
in first use of nuclear weapons. While our [leaders]{.underline} almost
certainly [had no intention of launching a first strike, they knew that
declaring this]{.underline} formally [would make a conventional
attack---which could be expected to escalate to a nuclear war---**more
likely**.]{.underline}

[In the cyber case, drawing a bright line for potential adversaries
virtually invites actions **just short of casus belli**. By
instead]{.underline} simply declaring that there may be circumstances in
which NATO will consider a cyber attack on one of its members an attack
on all---but [not spelling out what]{.underline} those
[circumstances]{.underline} may be---[those contemplating such an attack
will have an **additional risk factor to deter them**]{.underline}.

[The North Atlantic Council should simply come to an
understanding]{.underline} that the charter's 1947 language requiring an
"armed attack" to invoke collective defense is dated and [that
flexibility is needed]{.underline} for emerging threats. Plus, they
should agree to increase cooperation in this arena and streamline the
process by which consultation under Article 4 can take place.

#### [Divergence]{.underline} causes [tensions]{.underline}. 

Dr Max **Smeets 21**. Center for Security Studies, ETH Zürich
(Switzerland) . \"NATO allies' offensive cyber policy: A growing
divide?\". 8-6-2021.
https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/

[The **divergence in cyber policy** across NATO member states is
**problematic**. Allies **disagree** on]{.underline} both the [**goals
of cyber policy** and the **ways**]{.underline} and means [**to achieve
them**. This can **cause tension between allies**, especially when it
comes to the]{.underline} necessity and [legitimacy of]{.underline}
operating on each other's [national systems and networks]{.underline}.

Some may argue that these differences result from differences in
maturity. Some states simply have not caught up with the latest
developments, goes the argument. This assumes a single path to cyber
maturity or that the dynamics of cyberspace pull all states in the same
direction. It suggests that -- even without major policy coordination --
allies' cyber policies will converge over time. But a more persuasive
understanding of the current trend is that even though states can learn
from each other's institutional progress, [differences do not merely
stem from states "lagging behind." These states are on a **different
policy path**]{.underline}. This means it requires dedicated and
sustained policy attention to, at a minimum, coordinating the different
policies of states -- and potentially bring them closer together.

In the United States, [the greatest failures of response and deterrence
to foreign aggression in cyberspace]{.underline} have not been caused by
a lack of intelligence, capability or imagination. Rather, U.S. policy
[has been]{.underline} serviceable in theory but [**impotent in
practice** because of an inability to translate]{.underline} technical
[findings]{.underline} and intelligence [into **public support** for
sufficiently tough responses]{.underline} ordered [**by elected
political leaders**. North Korea's repeated operations]{.underline}
targeting U.S. companies and critical infrastructure [have been met with
**public skepticism** over their culpability]{.underline}, limiting the
strength of retaliatory options needed to deter further events. [Chinese
cyber economic espionage continued for years despite widespread
knowledge of China's activities because **political leaders found it
difficult** to confront]{.underline} Beijing without undermining U.S.
companies in return. Russian information operations did not sow enough
doubt to mislead experts, but they succeeded in exacerbating the
partisan polarization of an already-divided electorate and its leaders.

[That inability to translate the findings of cyber experts into **public
sentiment**]{.underline} and therefore political action **[has sidelined
America's cyberwarriors]{.underline}**, by far the most technologically
advanced and well-resourced in the world. [Imagine the political
response of an ally that is asked to burden-share in response to cyber
aggression but is probably **much closer to any resulting kinetic
fight** than the United States]{.underline}.

[Now imagine the response of that ally when it's being asked to take
causus belli on faith: The United States is presenting attribution for a
cyberattack elsewhere in the world, but perhaps is depending on the ally
lacking critical details due to classification]{.underline}, and is
presenting that information alongside a request for help that might well
put the ally in the crosshairs of its own cyberattack or lethal action.
[How can allies with different capabilities to collect, analyze and
understand intelligence be part of a consensus on using sovereign cyber
effects to support a NATO operation? How can a commander achieve a
common operational picture]{.underline} to authorize the use of
sovereign effects in a NATO operation if all the allies are not on the
same page with respect to critical attribution and other technical
information needed for a use of effect in an operation? We all know what
a tank looks like on a shared satellite image, but [if you ask three
cyber experts to interpret the attribution for a set of indicators, you
are likely to get at least four answers.]{.underline}

For most U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere, [there is simply a dearth
of technical know-how within the government when it comes to cyber
attribution and operations]{.underline}. This is already a challenge for
the United States, with a massive defense budget, Silicon Valley
innovation and an educated workforce to pull into government service.
But for many U.S. allies, tech-savvy public servants will have long fled
for the private sector, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and
academia before reaching ministerial positions.

To its credit, the U.S. National Cyber Strategy does propose
capacity-building measures to support allies. This means building up law
enforcement, intelligence, and military operational and investigative
capability. But [even with successful capacity-building programs, many
nations could]{.underline}, in a crisis, [end up in the same place the
United States is---with good options stuck on the shelf while
**political leaders and their electorates lack a critical mass of
informed voters to trust, understand and act on expert
findings**.]{.underline}

For countries weighing whether to risk their own blood and treasure in
support of an ally's cyber attribution findings, **[this hurdle
could]{.underline}** well **[prove insurmountable]{.underline}** if not
addressed well before a crisis emerges. Many such countries will no
doubt recall being burned when placing too much confidence in U.S.
technical and human sources without an ability to evaluate the evidence
for themselves, as with the Iraq weapons of mass destruction findings.

[Finally, NATO **needs to maintain ambiguity** on what justifies an
**Article 5 response**]{.underline}. As mentioned previously,
[**ambiguity has served NATO well**. A set **threshold
for**]{.underline} when NATO will invoke **[an Article 5 response to a
cyber-attack]{.underline}** on a member country [is **not
necessary**]{.underline}. This [ambiguity]{.underline} has historically
[served the alliance well]{.underline}, as demonstrated by the 9/11
attacks. [If the alliance had said weapons were only include guns,
bullets, tanks, and bombs, it would have **set a threshold precluding a
NATO response** to attacks that turned four planes into improvised
missiles]{.underline}. The larger issue of ambiguity is that there is no
set definition of what constitutes an armed attack and what
circumstances dictate a collective response, as per Article 5.
[Remaining ambiguous on]{.underline} the severity
**[threshold]{.underline}** of a cyber-attack [allows the alliance to
act in cases of **future cyber-attacks** that cause severe damage, but
also allow NATO to **refrain from over-reacting**]{.underline}, even if
an event is a cyber, or kinetic, attack as per a definition. [It would
be a **mistake to set a threshold for attacks** that cannot currently be
anticipated.]{.underline}

When NATO was originally formed, it was with the purpose to be
unambiguous, with the promise of "massive retaliation" by Eisenhower.
This was meant to constantly act as a reminder to the Soviet Union and
the Red Army that if they were to surge into Western Europe, in no
uncertain terms NATO would respond with nuclear weapons. Ambiguity is
useful in times, and at other times, it is not. Had NATO been ambiguous
in dealing with the Soviet Union, there could have been opportunity for
the Red Army to advance further across Europe, to test and see what
NATO, and the United States, would allow them to get away with, without
an attack. Ambiguity can also cause problems, particularly in the event
of a cyber-attack with some members feeling an attack might warrant
retaliation through Article 5, with others feeling that the necessary
thresholds have not been met. [It is important for NATO to have a clear
understanding, or general belief, of what would constitute a serious
enough cyber-attack in order to respond, but **not through official
policy**]{.underline} or rules [to ensure **proper
consideration**]{.underline}.

B. CONCLUSION

This thesis has reviewed the history of NATO and its role in the world,
and has found that since its creation post-WWII, the NATO alliance has
been able to adapt to changing times. It remains an organization that
promotes peace but will use force if necessary. NATO has taken on the
new challenge of cyber-attacks that the current world faces today. It
has also taken steps to prevent cyber-attacks on itself and member
countries, as well as to make it clear to any person, nation, or
organization that an Article 5 response will be invoked in the case of a
serious cyber-attack that can be deemed an armed attack according to
scale, effects, and attacker motivation.

[**Article 5 is the most important** article in the]{.underline}
Washington [Treaty, on which the **entire alliance is
hinged**]{.underline}. As in the 9/11 attacks on the United States by a
foreign enemy, NATO showed it was a force to be reckoned with when it
invoked Article 5 for the first time in its history. It came to the aid
of the United States and sent a loud resounding message to the world
that terrorism would not be tolerated.

[Since the cyber world is still]{.underline} so [new]{.underline} and
continues to advance each day with new technologies, [NATO is still
trying to find the best policies and best course of action to take in
response to]{.underline} the new [threats to **peace** and
**democracy**]{.underline} that cyber-attacks pose on the alliance and
this new world. NATO welcomes and many experts on cyberspace give it
recommendations on how to deal with this new threat. [The cyber world is
**too new for NATO to bind its hands**]{.underline}, so to speak,
[**with rigid rules and laws** regarding **when, how, and why it would
invoke Article 5** in the case of a cyber-attack on a member
country]{.underline}. In response, at the 2014 summit in Wales, [the
alliance made it clear that a cyber-attack can and will invoke an
Article 5 response. It]{.underline} also [made]{.underline} it [clear
that ambiguity has served the alliance well, and it **refused to define
the kind of attack that would invoke an Article 5
response**.]{.underline}

[One option is to lay out a specific policy]{.underline} that would be a
part of the Strategic Concept and [that describes the sort of cyber
attack that is damaging enough to trigger]{.underline} an [Article
5]{.underline} commitment from other NATO member states. The risk of
**[such a specific declaration]{.underline}** is that it **[could "green
light" lower level attacks by guaranteeing that they would not trigger a
NATO response]{.underline}**. The advantage of a specific policy is that
it sets up a clear red line for potential adversaries and potentially
deters more dangerous types of cyber attacks. Bureaucratically, clear
guidance about responding to cyber attacks could facilitate rapid
responses in a crisis and prevent dangerous delays that place the
security of member states at risk. While individual NATO member states
are capable of acting quickly, NATO as an institution, like many
institutions, works more slowly. Having preset procedures in place to
govern the response to a cyber attack could help NATO members
effectively coordinate in a crisis.

[NATO's]{.underline} publicly [declared policy on cyber threats
is]{.underline} consciously and purposefully **[vague]{.underline}**.207
**[Why? Strategic ambiguity has]{.underline}** its
**[benefits]{.underline}**. According to the Atlantic Council panel,
[there is no "redline" or "determined threshold" that would
automatically define a cyber act as]{.underline} an act of
[war]{.underline}.208 [Leaving the rules undefined affords NATO ample
**room** in which to operate]{.underline}. For a 28-member multinational
organization that operates on the principle of consensus, [**time and
latitude for solidifying strategic-level decisions are critical**. If
NATO publicized a **cyber redline**, it would **box the Alliance into a
corner**. This]{.underline} kind of policy [could **embolden cyber
offenders** and **provoke massive intrusions**]{.underline} that target
NATO's networks at [**just below this threshold**. Having a defined
redline could]{.underline} also [invite nefarious]{.underline} cyber
[actors to cross it to test NATO's resolve, damage its reputation as a

"[The new cyber policy has already been endorsed by Nato's 28 member
countries]{.underline}, and I have no doubt the heads of state and
government will do the same," said Jamie Shea, Nato deputy assistant
secretary general for emerging security challenges.

"For the first time [we are making an explicit link]{.underline} in this
policy [between cyber attacks]{.underline} at a certain threshold
[and]{.underline} the invocation of a Nato [article 5]{.underline}
collective defence as part of the treaty," he told Computer Weekly.

[Article 5]{.underline} of the North Atlantic treaty [requires member
states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed
attack, which includes cyber attack]{.underline} in the new cyber
defence policy.

But at [what threshold collective defence will be triggered, and how
this threshold will be measured, will remain secret as a form of
**deterrent**]{.underline}.

"[We are **keeping that ambiguous** so a potential **aggressor does not
get the idea** they can carry out cyber attacks up to a certain level
with **impunity**]{.underline}," said Shea.

NATO's collective defense role against cyber threats is a difficult
topic due to its complexity. However, [NATO needs to **defend itself and
its members in** every domain including the **cyber**]{.underline}.
Therefore, [**letting adversaries know** that **Article 5 could be
invoked** in case of a]{.underline} serious cyber-attack [is a
significant policy]{.underline} and resolution [in the alliance's cyber
defense]{.underline}. Jones (2015) summarizes the actions that [NATO
should]{.underline} take to [build]{.underline} a better [collective
defense against cyber threats and have effective and reliable Article 5
execution in order **to deter the adversaries** very well]{.underline}.
First, he states that "as part of its cyber defense program, NATO should
establish an early warning system that lets the alliance and its members
know when an attack is happening within enough time to stop it" (p. 45).
This would give the alliance a further notice before a cyber-attack
leads to a cyber conflict. Second, "NATO's deterrence strategy should
focus more on denial" (p. 45), because deterrence by denial will result
in adversary's abandonment of the action, and threat of punishment is
not effective due to the attribution problems. Third, "NATO and its
allies should encourage information sharing among its member nations and
within the alliance itself" (p. 45) because transparency is one of the
most significant aspects of a successful cyber defense for the Alliance.
Fourth, "NATO needs to hire or train a team of experts in hacking,
computer forensics, and cyber defense to aid its own organization and
come to the aid of member countries that have experienced a breach in
their security networks" (p. 47). Therefore, [cooperation and
information sharing is one of the most significant and essential assets
in fighting against the cyber threats to defend the alliance in the
cyber realm]{.underline}. Finally, "[NATO should **maintain ambiguity
for justifying an Article 5 response** in order to ensure that NATO can
act when justified"]{.underline} (p. 45). [This could give NATO
**flexibility and windows of opportunity** when evaluating a
cyber-attack and attributing it to an adversary.]{.underline}

[This threshold question is important for decisions **regarding

example, [didn\'t trigger]{.underline} the formal commitment under
[NATO\'s Article 5]{.underline}, in which an armed attack against one is
considered an armed attack against all. \[6\] **[Article
5]{.underline}** and its emphasis on the use of force has shaped Western
attitudes on warfare and defense for 60 years, **[and
NATO]{.underline}** nations **[will need to carefully consider how to
extend its application to cyberspace]{.underline}**. The attacks on
Estonia were intended to intimidate and punish but not to create damage.
[Lowering the threshold so Estonia-like incidents qualify]{.underline}
as the use of force could have some deterrent effect against state
opponents, but it [could]{.underline} also [be **destabilizing**, as
many **nonstate groups** and even **individuals** could launch similar

[The Sanger and Perlroth piece reviews the unattractive options the
United States has to respond to the DNC hack]{.underline}. The name and
shame strategy has no chance of working with the Russians, and would be
a laughable and self-defeating response to election-related intrusions.
[Something more aggressive]{.underline}---[like a **cyber or kinetic
attack of some sort against Russia**]{.underline}---[runs the risk of
serious **escalation**]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} **[serious
escalation]{.underline}** [by the Russians to **further interfere in the
U.S. election**]{.underline}. Morell proposes instead "deep sanctions on
the entire Russian economy" and an "aggressive Voice of America program
in Russian to tell the Russian people that Putin is only interested in
his own aggrandizement." Can the United States coordinate effective
deeper sanctions against Russia? Would the VOA strategy change the minds
of the Russian people? I think these responses would not work in the
first instance. But the important point is that the USG must, and does,
think about the Russian response to any of these tactics. And
[if]{.underline} (as seems likely) [Russia is willing to raise the
stakes in cyber in response, the U.S. probably has **much more to lose
than win by ratcheting things up**]{.underline}. And so the USG responds
with uncertainty and weakness, thereby emboldening adversaries in a
cycle that has been repeating itself, to our detriment, for years.

[The tepid U.S. response]{.underline} to cyber intrusions may be
surprising to some, since the USG possesses the greatest offensive cyber
capabilities on the planet, which it often deploys for
cyber-exploitation and cyber-attacks and, one can guess, for information
operations of various kinds. Here we [come to the crux of the
matter]{.underline}. For two basic reasons, the USG is not willing to
use these tools, or its redoubtable kinetic tools, to redress fully the
very serious cyber-operations by adversaries inside U.S. networks.
First, [our adversaries have a wide array of sophisticated digital
weapons that they are willing and able to use to harm or exploit porous
and poorly defended U.S. networks]{.underline}. And second, **[the
United States is by far more dependent on digital
networks]{.underline}** and the digital economy **[than any other nation
in the world]{.underline}**, and thus has the most to lose from any
escalation related to cyber. As Sanger and Perlroth put these points:
"[Well-armed cyberpowers face few limits to their ability to **escalate
attacks**]{.underline}. And [it is unclear how the United States can
establish]{.underline} what the generals call '**[escalation
dominance']{.underline}** --- [the assurance that America can ultimately
control how a conflict ends]{.underline}."

[Retaliatory cyber attacks are **not a good idea**]{.underline}, an

International and (ISC)2 2013 annual congresses in Chicago.

[Although]{.underline} security practitioners\' [ability to trace the
source]{.underline} of cyber attacks [is improving]{.underline}, they
said [it is seldom possible to do this with total
certainty]{.underline}, particularly in the most sophisticated attacks.

But [even where attribution is possible, **retaliation is not
good**]{.underline} because [it typically leads to an **escalation of
attacks** and an increase in complexity]{.underline}, said Scott Borg,
chief of the US Cyber Consequences Unit.

"We already know attackers are able to dodge every defence trick and, as
we get better at attribution, attackers will go to increasingly
sophisticated methods, and then we are in trouble," he said.

Dave Tyson, senior director of global information security at SC Johnson
& Son, said that, when eBay sought to take action against someone
selling eBay fraud kits, he went after the company with all he could.

"It took eBay a lot of time, effort and money to put this guy in jail,"
Tyson said.

and caution need to be exercised]{.underline} when considering
retaliatory attacks, said Hord Tipton, executive director of (ISC)2.

[Cyberspace is]{.underline} also [a realm where traditional notions of
deterrence]{.underline} may [break down. Deterring a threat by issuing
counter-threats to deliver a devastating response to any cyber attack
against]{.underline} the United States and its [NATO]{.underline} allies
[may seem like an attractive solution]{.underline} to the cyber security
challenge. The high costs associated with defending networks from cyber
intrusions and the relatively low costs of launching a cyber attack have
led many to analogize cyber deterrence to nuclear deterrence.31
[However, cyber attacks lack the stable footprint of conventional
military forces. The fact that terrorist attacks **do not leave a
"return address"** is accentuated in the case of **cyber warfare**. In
the case of a cyber attack]{.underline}, for example, [even tracking
down the specific computer]{.underline} from which an attack was
launched [might not give the attacked country sufficient information to
distinguish whether a country, terrorist group, or rogue individual
launched an attack]{.underline} from that particular computer. [These
concerns]{.underline}, in part, [are why]{.underline} U.S. Deputy
[Secretary of Defense]{.underline} William Lynn recently [stated that
denying adversaries access to U.S. information systems]{.underline} in
the first place, **[rather than planning to retaliate]{.underline}** in
case of an attack, [encompasses the bulk of U.S. defensive
efforts]{.underline}.32 The United States and its **[NATO]{.underline}**
partners must invest heavily in defending their networks from intrusion
and **[cannot be confident that maintaining nascent retaliatory
capabilities will suffice to deter attacks]{.underline}**. Furthermore,
while strong cyber ties between NATO members might not ensure that
deterrence succeeds, weak cyber ties will almost certainly encourage
adversaries to launch more cyber incursions against NATO members.33
Finally, since many future wars will likely include major cyber
components, thinking about cyberspace as a very separate sphere of
warfare delinked from other areas of conflict is counterproductive.34

[Cyberspace enables **anonymous attacks**]{.underline}. [Identities are

or even whether it has been removed from all infected systems.

[**Weak attribution** and **unpredictable collateral damage** make
deterrence **ineffective in cyberspace**. Deterrence is a threat of
retaliation, but it is **hard to credibly threaten unknown parties** and
**counterproductive** to threaten]{.underline} or damage the [wrong
party. The United States is widely recognized to have pre-eminent
offensive cyber capabilities, but it obtains **little deterrent effect**
from this.]{.underline}

[In the absence of attribution, the response options for the United
States]{.underline} to the July 4 events [were extremely limited. We
could not retaliate against an unknown attacker]{.underline}. Deterrence
is the threat of violent retaliation. This threat changes the opponent's
calculus of the benefits and costs of an attack. But [it is hard to
convincingly threaten an unknown attacker, and weak attribution makes
**traditional deterrent concepts**]{.underline} -- those based on the
threat of reprisal for an attack (either counterforce or countervalue)
-- largely **[irrelevant in cyberspace]{.underline}**.

#### Attribution makes cyber deterrence impossible.

The main reason behind this was likely a desire to maximize the
deterrent effect of the Alliance in the cyberdomain. However, [the
cyberdomain poses considerable **deterrence limitations**]{.underline}.
[Deterrence works if one party is able to successfully convey to another
that it is both capable and willing to use]{.underline} a set of
available ([military]{.underline}) [instruments]{.underline} in
retaliation if the other crosses a line. But [for this to work, the
opponent should first, be a state, and second, be identifiable as an
attacker]{.underline}. While states can be behind some cases of
cyberincidents (they are not usually the culprits), **[attackers do not
have to fear retaliation]{.underline}**, since **[they can likely remain
anonymous if they choose]{.underline}**. [It is particularly tricky to
identify actors in a **timely manner** due to frequent time lapses
between the action that an perpetrator takes, the intrusion itself, and
the effects of the intrusion]{.underline}. And [even if one or several
perpetrators could be identified certainly]{.underline}---**[proving
that a state actor]{.underline}** (or a terrorist organization) **[had
coordinated their actions would be the next difficulty.]{.underline}**

### XT\-\--1NC 5\-\--No Cyber Impact

[Absent]{.underline} such [larger conflict]{.underline}, however, [a
nation-state is no more likely to launch a serious cyber attack than
they are to **shoot a random missile at an opponent**]{.underline}.9
**[The risk is too great and the benefits of a cyber attack by itself
too small]{.underline}** for political leaders to authorize the use of
this capability in anything short of a situation where they had already
decided on military action. [Cyber weapons are not decisive; cyber
attack by itself will not win a conflict]{.underline}, particularly
against a large and powerful opponent. It is striking that [to date;
**no cyber \"attack\"** that rises above the level of espionage or crime
has been launched **outside of a military conflict**.]{.underline}

[Even in a conflict, a decision to strike civilian targets in an
opponent's homeland using cyber weapons is a major step that brings the
**risk of serious escalation**]{.underline}. Engaging American military
forces overseas is not the same as attacking critical infrastructure in
the United States. Nations may reserve these serious cyber attacks
against targets in the opponent's homeland for either retaliation for
attacks against their own homeland or for when they are in extremis.

### XT\-\--1NC 7\-\--Private Sector 

#### Defending the private sector is [impossible]{.underline}\-\--attempts [overstretch]{.underline} the alliance and [shred credibility]{.underline}

Todd **Rosenblum 16**. Former Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Homeland Defense and Americas\' Security Affairs. \"NATO and Cyberwar
Strategy: Proceed with Caution\". Cipher Brief.
https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/nato-and-cyberwar-strategy-proceed-with-caution

For example, [attacks against domestic critical infrastructure
constitute an unrefined and hugely **expansive mission space**. Should
it be an alliance military mission?]{.underline} Should this come under
NATO's security umbrella? **[Expanding Article V]{.underline}**
protections **[to]{.underline}** attacks against **[private sector
operations]{.underline}** may seem logical to some, but NATO should
proceed with great caution before promising its security umbrella to
cyber homeland security and resiliency. Asserting protection and
response to attacks in this area, [over-states NATO's capacities and
**undermines alliance credibility**]{.underline}.

There are a host of reasons why **[NATO must confine its]{.underline}**
ambitions to government network defense and [**response**, and rethink
whether domestic infrastructure protection really]{.underline} is -- or
[should be]{.underline} -- [part of its writ]{.underline}.

First among the reasons is that [the private sector]{.underline} owns
and operates the vast majority of critical infrastructure and [may **not
want** NATO or]{.underline} even their own [government]{.underline}'s
[help. The private sector has its own diverse perspectives, and the
crisis management links between government and the private sector simply
**do not exist. Calling this a NATO mission** makes **essential
coordination** with the private sector **exponentially harder**.
Differing national laws and]{.underline} ethos [that define
government--private sector cooperation makes it **nearly
impossible**.]{.underline}

NATO members, like so many national governments, continue to minimize
the reality that the private sector is at least as central as
governments in cyber crisis management and response. Unlike traditional
armed conflict, deterrence and crisis management is a joint venture with
the private sector, no matter how often governments think they will be
the tip of the spear.

[The private sector]{.underline} is not only a co-equal branch in cyber
crisis management but **[has different stakes]{.underline}** than
governments and multinational alliances. [Information technology and
other major companies are borderless, and responsive to global
stakeholders]{.underline} and financial markets. **[Their
interests]{.underline}** often **[do not align with]{.underline}** those
of [**governments**, and certainly not **major military
alliances**]{.underline}. The private sector generally has superior
capabilities than governments. [Its decisions about what to do, when to
do it, and how to do it, will take government views into account but
will **not be beholden** to them]{.underline}.

[Revisiting]{.underline} North Korea's repeated [attacks against
Sony]{.underline} America's networks throughout 2014
[highlight]{.underline} how different and [difficult]{.underline} crisis
management is in the domestic digital domain. [NATO will do well to
remember how complicated this event was for the United States national
security apparatus.]{.underline}

In brief, the North Korean state attacked the digital data stores of the
American subsidiary of a Japanese company. The key actors through most
of the crisis were all in the private sector, and Sony responses were
framed more by the actions of its rivals and business partners in
industry than anything said or done by government. Not surprisingly,
**[individual business interests outweighed common cause. Private sector
unity was not possible.]{.underline}**

Of course the U.S. government played an important role late in the
crisis when President Obama declared there to be a national interest in
the situation and imposed sanctions on the North Korean state. But the
central point is that [critical decisions were made by the private
sector, based on business needs, damage assessments, and
capabilities.]{.underline}

[**Government was not able to manage this major crisis** even though it
involved a nuclear weapon state]{.underline} threatening physical
strikes in the U.S. homeland. [Events since, such as Apple's **refusal
to cooperate** with a court order to assist the government in accessing
encrypted information on a terrorist's iPhone, reinforces the reality
that the relationship between government and industry is getting more
**distant**, not closer]{.underline}. Apple probably would be even less
likely to cooperate with a 28 nation military alliance than with its
"home" government.

Just [imagine how complex it would be for a 28 nation military alliance
to assert response dominion against digital attacks by a known adversary
against the networks controlling a member's key
infrastructure]{.underline}. [What if]{.underline} the [company(s)
involved had deep **business interests** in the adversary nation and
**refused to work** with the alliance]{.underline} in fashioning a
response? What if its business interest compelled accommodation? [What
if it did not want to share]{.underline} its essential capabilities
[with]{.underline} government (or [a]{.underline} large [military
alliance]{.underline}) fearing doing so would be a competitive
disadvantage?

National security officials across the globe struggle with the idea that
[**the private sector is not subservient to government** in
protecting]{.underline} their [information]{.underline} technology
interests and often is just as capable as government in intelligence
gathering and response planning. [Cohesion]{.underline} between the two
worlds [is **not likely unless the private sector becomes an essential
actor** in this element of national security decision making
space.]{.underline}

This is not to say industry can operate alone. Industry has many
dependencies on government. Only governments can set laws and press
treaty enforcement between states. Industry relies on government to
provide emergency response assistance if digital strikes have a physical
effect, such as a major power outage. Governments often hold key bits of
information that can complete the operating picture environment.

The shared dependency between government and the public sector provide
opportunity to remake decision-making processes heretofore made solely
by government actors. Until we make more headway remaking these
processes, [NATO would be wise to constrain its ambitions to **defending
its own networks**]{.underline} and improving its operational
resiliency. [It should **set aside** planning to protect and respond to
digital strikes against privately owned domestic critical
infrastructure]{.underline}.

NATO has more than enough challenges ensuring its communications
integrity and updating war plans to fully accommodate for fighting in
the digital domain. Let's [leave the hornet's nest of what the alliance
should do in response to attacks on domestic infrastructure and private
companies to a more settled period.]{.underline}

### XT\-\--1NC 8\-\--No Democracy Impact

#### No democratic peace 

Jeff **Grabmeier 15**. Senior Director, Research communications, Media &
PR \"\'Democratic peace\' may not prevent international conflict\". No
Publication. 9-3-2015.
https://phys.org/news/2015-09-democratic-peace-international-conflict.html

[Using a new technique to analyze 52 years of international conflict,
researchers suggest that there may be **no such thing as a \"democratic
peace.\"**]{.underline}

In addition, [a model developed with this new technique was found to
predict international conflict five and even ten years in the future
**better than any existing model**.]{.underline}

[Democratic peace is the widely held theory that democracies are less
likely to go to war]{.underline} against each other than countries with
other types of government.

In the new study, [researchers found that economic trade relationships
and participation in international governmental organizations play a
strong role]{.underline} in keeping the peace among countries. **[But
democracy? Not so much]{.underline}**.

\"That\'s a startling finding because the value of joint democracy in
preventing war is what we thought was the closest thing to a law in
international politics,\" said Skyler Cranmer, lead author of the study
and The Carter Phillips and Sue Henry Associate Professor of Political
Science at The Ohio State University.

\"There\'s been empirical research supporting this theory for the past
50 years. [Even U.S. presidents have touted the value of a democratic
peace, but **it doesn\'t seem to hold up**, at least the way we looked
at it]{.underline}.\"
