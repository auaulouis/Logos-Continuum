## Mutual Restraint Counterplan

### OFF

#### The United States federal government should offer an agreement of mutual cooperation and restraint in cyberspace, with at least the Russian federation, that requires each side to restrain from information warfare and guarantees cyber non-intervention. 

#### The counterplan [solves the case]{.underline} through [Russian restraint]{.underline} and avoids [codifying retaliation]{.underline} to [below threshold attacks]{.underline}. Deterrence is [insufficient]{.underline}.

"We assess [[Moscow will apply]{.mark} lessons learned from its campaign
aimed at the U.S. presidential [election]{.mark} to future
[influence]{.mark} efforts in the United States]{.underline}," says the
U.S. intelligence community in the most important sentence in its
dismayingly evidence-free report on Russian activities in the
presidential election. But [how is [the United States]{.mark} going to
check]{.underline} these future [influence efforts]{.underline}?

Simplifying a great deal, [when a nation is vulnerable]{.underline} to a
foreign threat [it [has]{.mark} three [courses of
action]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}to improve its situation:
([1]{.underline}) It can raise its [defenses]{.underline};
(**[2]{.underline}**) it can credibly
[**[threaten]{.underline}**]{.mark} greater
[**[consequences]{.underline}**]{.mark} for the attacker, [thereby
deterring]{.underline} the attacker from action;
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} (**[3]{.underline}**) it can [[**cut a
deal**]{.mark} in which it pledges to forego certain actions in exchange
for relief from the threat by the adversary. I think the U.S. government
**focuses too much on** (1) and (**2**) and **not enough on**
(**3**).]{.underline}

The United States is not close to raising its defenses adequately and
likely will not in the foreseeable future. Offense has too great an
advantage over defense. We have too many soft targets and are constantly
surprised when new ones are attached or exploited. (The government was
stupefied by the OPM hack, and the Sony hack, and the DNC hack, among
many others.) And we lack the consensus needed to take the controversial
steps that would truly raise our cyber defenses.

[[As]{.mark} is [evident in]{.mark} the]{.underline} Obama
administration's [[failure to respond to earlier Russian
penetration]{.mark} of networks in the White House, Pentagon, and State
Department, and in its relatively tepid response to the highly
destabilizing DNC hack, **[deterrence is simply not going to
work]{.mark} in this context**. The United States has [the]{.mark} most
powerful [military]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}, including the
greatest capacities in offensive cyber. But **[it [cannot]{.mark} use
these tools to [credibly commit to retaliate]{.mark} powerfully against
harmful cyber operations]{.underline}**, especially ones that fall
**[[below the "use of force" or "armed attack"
thresholds]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Attribution]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially credible attribution in public, [[is a]{.underline}]{.mark}
very large [[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}. And the United States
significant digital dependencies mean that it loses in escalation in
cyber because, as President Obama explained, "our economy is more
digitalized and it is more vulnerable, partly because we are a wealthier
nation and we are more wired than some of these other countries and we
have a more opened society and we are engaged in less control or
censorships of over what happens on the internet." It's also clear that
the vaunted "name and shame" strategy simply doesn't work in high-stakes
contexts. "The idea that somehow public shaming is going to be
effective, I think doesn't read the thought process in Russia very
well," Obama noted. [You don't have to take my word that deterrence
isn't going to get the job done; as DNI]{.underline} James [Clapper said
last week: "[We]{.mark} currently [cannot put]{.mark} a lot of
[stock]{.mark}, at least in my mind, [in cyber deterrence]{.mark}. ...
[It is]{.mark} ... **very [hard to create]{.mark} the substance and
[psychology of deterrence]{.mark}**, in my view."]{.underline}

[[That leaves]{.underline}]{.mark} (3), **[[cutting a
deal]{.underline}]{.mark}**. I'm not talking about squishy cyber
"norms." There is a lot of happy talk about cyber norms, but this talk
is almost always about how the United States can force adversaries to
agree to the rules of the road that it likes best. [I am talking about
[an agreement of mutual restraint]{.mark}: the United States agrees to
**restrain**]{.underline} itself [**in its activities in foreign
networks** in exchange for **restraint from our
adversaries**]{.underline} in our networks. As I wrote six years ago:

> [U.S. cybersecurity policymakers are in the habit of thinking too much
> about those who attack us and too little about our attacks on
> others]{.underline}. Creating norms to curb cyberattacks is difficult
> enough because the attackers' identities are hard to ascertain. But
> another large hurdle is the federal government\'s refusal to
> acknowledge more fully its many offensive cyber activities, or to
> propose which such activities it might clamp down on in exchange for
> reciprocal concessions by our adversaries.

I have expressed skepticism about treaties as a solution to disorder in
the cyber realm, and some of the basis for that skepticism, including
attribution difficulties, applies to any form of agreement in this
context. But I am increasingly of the view that [[the **only
way**]{.mark} **that [the United States can get relief]{.mark}** from
damaging foreign cyberoperations [is to]{.mark} significantly
[restrain]{.mark} its own cyberactivities abroad.]{.underline}

The first step to understanding here, I think, is to try to put oneself
in the skin of the adversary, to understand how it sees the world and
why it acts the way it does. The United States is angry because of the
consequential Russian intervention in the election. But it is important
to understand that the United States is widely perceived by Russia to
intervene in Russian domestic affairs in ways that are just as offensive
and threatening, at least to the leadership in Russia, and just as
violative of Russian sovereignty.

For example: [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} attributes the embarrassing
and destabilizing protests that began in Russia after the December 2011
legislative election to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's charges of
voter fraud in the election and the "signal" her State Department sent
to opposition leaders in Russia. He also [[claimed]{.mark} that [the
United States was responsible for the Panama Papers]{.mark}, which he
described as and "attempt to destabilize the internal situation" in
Russia]{.underline}. NATO's enlargement to many former Soviet states,
especially to the Baltic States in 2004, when Putin was President of
Russia, was not an intervention in Russia's domestic affairs per se, but
it was an embarrassing and threatening intrusion into Russia's sphere of
influence. So too was the extension of missile defense systems to
eastern Europe.

But perhaps [nothing is as threatening as the pledges and activities
associated with the U.S. "Internet Freedom" initiative]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} (among other things) [involves funding and technical
support to empower citizens in authoritarian states]{.underline} to
circumvent censorship and promote speech there. Russia views this
initiative as "a U.S. strategy to intervene in \[its\] domestic politics
through cyber means," as David Fidler notes. To get a sense of the
extent to which the Russian (and Chinese) governments are threatened by
the core elements of the U.S. Internet Freedom initiative, and
(relatedly) of the social media and related tools of the U.S. internet
technology industries, [consider four of the six "main threats in the
field of international information security" listed in the 2015
Russia-PRC Cyber pact]{.underline} (a poor translation, but the gist
comes through):

> [The Parties believe that the main threats to international
> information security are]{.underline} the use of information and
> communication technologies:
>
> 1\) [to carry out acts of aggression aimed at the violation of the
> sovereignty]{.underline}, security, territorial integrity of States
> and a threat to international peace, security and strategic stability;
>
> 2\) [for the application of economic and other damage, including
> through]{.underline} the provision of a destructive impact on the
> objects of the [information infrastructure]{.underline}; ...
>
> 5\) [to interfere in the internal affairs of States]{.underline},
> violations of public order, incitement of ethnic, racial and religious
> hatred, propaganda of racist and xenophobic ideas and theories that
> give rise to hatred and discrimination, incitement to violence and
> instability, as well as to destabilize the internal political and
> socio-economic situation, violation of government;
>
> 6\) [for the dissemination of information harmful to the
> socio-political and socioeconomic systems, spiritual, moral and
> cultural environment of other States]{.underline}.

In short, **[[China and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, among our most
potent adversaries, **[[see efforts to weaken their control]{.mark} over
their networks [as a direct threat to]{.mark} their core [sovereign
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They view it in the same way that we
view the intervention in our election.

This latter point is surprising to many. [A casual consumer]{.underline}
of the news in the United States [would think that the United States is
the main victim in the confrontations going on in the cyber
realm]{.underline}. It is indeed a victim. But **[[the United States
is]{.mark} also]{.underline}** widely **[[perceived]{.mark} around the
world [as the greatest threat]{.mark} in the cyber realm]{.underline}**.
[It has]{.underline}, as President Obama bragged last Fall, [greater
offensive cyber capabilities than any other nation. And [it is
**perceived** ]{.mark}**abroad to use these capacities
[aggressively]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
**[[Stuxnet]{.underline}]{.mark}**, now widely attributed to the United
States, [is one example]{.underline}. The [[**Snowden**]{.mark}
revelations were an even bigger deal]{.underline}. They provided clear,
extensive, concrete evidence about the numerous impressive (and, to
many, shocking) ways that [the United States penetrates [and]{.mark}
collects information in foreign networks]{.underline}. And of course the
United States isn't taking all of the information stolen from foreign
networks and putting it in a box. [It uses the fruits of its espionage
and theft to bolster every element of its foreign and defense policy,
and its national and economic security.]{.underline}

It's also worth noting, in this context, the many episodes in which [the
United States has intervened in **[foreign elections]{.mark}**. I
summarized some of the evidence [in]{.mark} posts last
summer]{.underline}. A study by Dov Levin found that during the Cold
War, [the United States intervened to influence foreign elections over
**twice as often**]{.underline} (69% to 31%) [as the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. In many of these [cases the United States
"**weaponized information**" to sway the election. U.S. electoral
intervention continued after the Cold War. A prominent example
is]{.underline} its support of the populist Boris [**Yeltsin** in
the]{.underline} 1996 [[Russia]{.mark}n presidential
election]{.underline}. "\[[W\]e've got to go all the way in
helping]{.underline} in every other respect" besides a nominating
speech, Bill [Clinton told Russia advisor]{.underline} Strobe Talbott,
who further explained in his memoir that Clinton visited Moscow in April
1996 "for no other purpose than to give Yeltsin a pre-election boost."
The Clinton administration gave Yeltsin other forms of political
support, and ensured that the IMF gave Russia a \$10 billion loan in
what the New York Times described as a "major election-year boost for"
Yeltsin. [Other post-Cold War examples include]{.underline} the U.S.
[financing of "Syrian political opposition groups and related projects,
including a satellite TV channel]{.underline} that beams anti-government
programming into the country" ([another example of "**weaponizing
information**"]{.underline}); [similar activities in the]{.underline}
2000 **[[Yugoslav]{.mark} election]{.underline}**, which Levin concludes
was "decisive" in defeating Milosevic; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
(according to David Ignatius) the aborted U.S. covert action in the Fall
of 2004 to influence elections in **[[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In response to this history, I hear many people say some version of:
"But the United States has never doxed another country covertly in the
middle of a democratic election." We don't actually know that, but we do
know this: The United States has covertly stolen information from
foreign political parties, it has weaponized information, and it has
influenced foreign elections. Perhaps the United States has not done
these three things together, at least on the scale of the Russia
operation. But the precise contours of U.S. action abroad do not define
lawful or appropriate behavior, such that our adversaries feel compelled
to do to us only what we do to them. The main point is that the United
States is widely seen to engage in activities in other countries,
including Russia, that are analogous to the DNC hack and that are viewed
to threaten core sovereign interests abroad.

I should be clear, in a probably futile effort deflect charges of
Russophilia (or worse), that I am not making a normative judgment here.
Obviously there are huge differences in substance between (i)
intervening in a foreign nation to disrupt democratic processes and (ii)
intervening in a foreign nation to promote democracy and free speech. My
normative preferences, for what they are worth, are for the United
States to exploit its offensive advantages in cyber to collect whatever
information serves our national interests, to use this information in
ways that serve our interests, and to promote those interests further by
spreading the U.S. conception of freedom of speech and thought to other
nations.

The question is whether these are realistic goals. I think they are not,
given the clear costs that the United States is suffering and will
continue to suffer in the cyber realm. I don't think the United States
can continue unabated with all of its aggressive cyber actions
abroad---intelligence collection, cyber attacks, information operations,
and especially operations that undermine control abroad---if it wants
relief from the cyber operations that are proving to be so damaging to
U.S. society. Rather, I think [[the only hope it]{.mark} has [to]{.mark}
gain relief from these devastating cyber actions]{.underline}---or, at a
minimum, a hope worth exploring---[is to **[give]{.mark} our
[adversaries]{.mark} relief from our cyber actions**]{.underline} that
[they perceive to be devastating]{.underline}. I am not talking about a
treaty. But [I am talking about [an **explicit
understanding**]{.mark}]{.underline} with major cyber adversaries, [akin
to **understandings about the rules**]{.underline} of espionage during
the Cold War, [that [the United States will **not engage in**
]{.mark}**certain specific [disruptive actions in exchange for desirable
restraint]{.mark}** []{.mark}by adversaries in U.S.
networks]{.underline}.

Cooperation in the cyber realm will not be easy, even on a bilateral
basis. There are many hurdles, some of which I outline here in the
context of treaties. Attribution will always be a problem. It might not
be possible to agree on the precise elements of mutual restraint. And it
is possible that a spiraling tit for tat is the only compelling logic
here, and that the United States will lose overall due to its digital
vulnerabilities. I don't minimize the hurdles. I only want to suggest
that the option of mutual restraint should be explored.

I don't think that U.S. intelligence collection capabilities per se are
at stake. [What [our]{.mark} authoritarian [adversaries]{.mark} really
[care about]{.mark}]{.underline}---where they are vulnerable in ways
analogous to U.S. vulnerabilities in the recent election---[are [U.S.
efforts to use its cyber]{.mark} and related capabilities in ways that
are deemed disruptive to their domestic orders]{.underline}, i.e. the
very thing the United States is up in arms about now. [[The]{.mark} most
plausible item the [United States could]{.mark} offer up in
[exchange]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}for reciprocal restraint [would
be [the **U.S. Internet freedom initiative**]{.mark} writ
large]{.underline}, including efforts by the United States and U.S.
firms to promote certain forms of speech abroad, and to enable
circumvention of foreign tools of digital control. It would be a huge
cost to the United States to tamp down on those activities, which have
been central to its foreign policy during the last two administrations,
and which in some ways define traditional U.S. foreign policy. But the
costs on the other side are very high as well, and [the possibility of
some forms of mutual restraint should]{.underline} at least [be
explored]{.underline} in a serious way.

One response to this argument that I hear in conversation is some
version of: "The United States should be able to have its cake and eat
it too." On this view, the United States is the strongest nation in the
world militarily and economically, and should not have to give up any of
its cyber and related capabilities in exchange for relief from adversary
cyber and related actions. We have to get tougher, act more
aggressively, and the like. I am surprised by this reaction because in
other contexts---most notably, nuclear weapons---the United States
perceived a clear advantage from giving up offensive capabilities in
exchange for the threat reduction of reciprocal concessions. But in any
event, [the "tough guy" line of thinking is belied by events of the last
five years]{.underline} or so, [which has made clear that problems of
attribution, escalation, and digital vulnerability mean that no matter
how powerful we are]{.underline} at the moment, **[we cannot in fact
have our cake and eat it too]{.underline}** in this context.

### Solvency\-\--Comparative\-\--2NC

#### [Mutual agreement]{.underline} is a [prerequisite to solvency]{.underline}\-\--[retaliation fails]{.underline} because adversaries think the US is [too strong]{.underline}. 

Jack **Goldsmith 10**. Teaches @ Harvard Law School and is on the Hoover
Institution\'s Task Force on National Security and Law. \"Can we stop
the global cyber arms race?\". 2-1-2010.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013101834.html

In a speech this month on \"Internet freedom,\" Secretary of State
Hillary [Clinton decried]{.underline} the [cyberattacks that threaten
U.S.]{.underline} economic and national security
[interests]{.underline}. \"[Countries]{.underline} or individuals that
engage in cyber attacks [should face consequences]{.underline} and
international condemnation,\" [she warned]{.underline}, alluding to the
China-Google kerfuffle. We should \"create norms of behavior among
states and encourage respect for the global networked commons.\"

Perhaps so. But [the problem with Clinton\'s call for
**accountability**]{.underline} and norms on the global network \-- [a
call frequently heard in policy discussions about
cybersecurity]{.underline} \-- [is the enormous array of cyberattacks
**originating from the United States**]{.underline}. [Until we
acknowledge **these attacks and signal how we might control
them**]{.underline}, **[we cannot make progress on preventing
cyberattacks]{.underline}** emanating **[from other
countries]{.underline}**.

An important weapon in the cyberattack arsenal is a botnet, a cluster of
thousands and sometimes millions of compromised computers under the
ultimate remote control of a \"master.\" Botnets were behind last
summer\'s attack on South Korean and American government Web sites, as
well as prominent attacks a few years ago on Estonian and Georgian
sites. They are also engines of spam that can deliver destructive
malware that enables economic espionage or theft.

[The United States has the most]{.underline}, or nearly the most,
[infected botnet computers and is thus the country from which a good
chunk of botnet attacks stem]{.underline}. **[The government could crack
down on botnets]{.underline}**, but doing so would raise the cost of
software or Internet access and would be controversial. So it has not
acted, and the number of dangerous botnet attacks from America grows.

[The United States is also a leading source of
\"**hacktivists**\"]{.underline} who use digital tools to fight
oppressive regimes. Scores of individuals and groups in the United
States design or employ computer payloads to attack government Web
sites, computer systems and censoring tools in Iran and China. [These
efforts are often supported by U.S. foundations and universities, and by
the federal government]{.underline}. Clinton boasted about this support
seven paragraphs after complaining about cyberattacks.

Finally, [the U.S. government has perhaps the world\'s most powerful and
sophisticated offensive cyberattack capability.]{.underline} This
capability remains highly classified. But the New York Times has
reported that the [Bush]{.underline} administration [used cyberattacks
on insurgent cellphones and computers in Iraq, and that it approved a
plan for attacks on computers related to Iran\'s nuclear weapons
program]{.underline}. And the government is surely doing much more. \"We
have U.S. warriors in cyberspace that are deployed overseas\" and \"live
in adversary networks,\" says Bob Gourley, the former chief technology
officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency.

These warriors are now under the command of Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander,
director of the National Security Agency. The NSA, the world\'s most
powerful signals intelligence organization, is also in the business of
breaking into and extracting data from offshore enemy computer systems
and of engaging in computer attacks that, in the NSA\'s words,
\"disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy the information\" found in these
systems. When the Obama administration created \"cyber command\" last
year to coordinate U.S. offensive cyber capabilities, it nominated
Alexander to be in charge.

Simply put, **[the United States is in a big way doing the very things
that Clinton criticized]{.underline}**. We are not, like the Chinese,
stealing intellectual property from U.S. firms or breaking into the
accounts of democracy advocates. But [we are aggressively using the same
or similar computer techniques for ends we deem worthy]{.underline}.

Our potent offensive cyber operations matter for reasons beyond the
hypocrisy inherent in undifferentiated condemnation of cyberattacks.
Even if we could stop all cyberattacks from our soil, we wouldn\'t want
to. On the private side, hacktivism can be a tool of liberation. On the
public side, the best defense of critical computer systems is sometimes
a good offense. \"My own view is that the only way to counteract both
criminal and espionage activity online is to be proactive,\" Alexander
said last year, adding that if the Chinese were inside critical U.S.
computer systems, he would \"want to go and take down the source of
those attacks.\"

[Our adversaries are aware of our]{.underline} prodigious and [growing
offensive cyber capacities]{.underline} and exploits. In a survey
published Thursday by the security firm McAfee, [more information
technology experts from critical infrastructure firms around the world
expressed **concern about the United States** as a source of computer
network attacks than about any other country]{.underline}. [This
awareness]{.underline}, along with our vulnerability to cyberattacks,
[fuels a dangerous public and private **cyber arms race** in an arena
where the offense already has a natural advantage.]{.underline}

**[Everyone agrees on the need to curb this race]{.underline}** by
creating proper norms of network behavior. [But]{.underline} like
Clinton, [U.S. cybersecurity policymakers are in the habit of thinking
too much about those who attack us and too little about our attacks on
others]{.underline}. Creating norms to curb cyberattacks is difficult
enough because the attackers\' identities are hard to ascertain. But
[another large hurdle is the federal government\'s **refusal
to**]{.underline} acknowledge more fully its many offensive cyber
activities, or to **[propose]{.underline}** which such **[activities it
might clamp down on in exchange for reciprocal concessions by our
adversaries]{.underline}**.

### Solvency\-\--Cyber Treaty\-\--2NC

#### Cyber treaty solves attacks and miscalculation. 

Ido **Kilovaty 16**. Cyber Fellow at the Center for Global Legal
Challenges at Yale Law School. \"Towards a Cyber-Security Treaty\". Just
Security. 8-3-2016.
https://www.justsecurity.org/32268/cyber-security-treaty/

While these frameworks provide evidence of common interests, they are
indeed only a start, due to their non-binding nature. Stepping out of
the laws of war rhetoric, [the most]{.underline} ambitious and probably
the most [productive approach to cyber threats would be to push toward
the framing of a **cyber-specific treaty**. A cyber-treaty would
mitigate some of the outstanding challenges the DNC hack has
illustrated. It would help **preventing the expansion of cyber-attacks
falling below the threshold in which the laws of war kick
in**]{.underline}; as importantly, [it would help **protect democratic
political processes and domestic self-government** at home and
abroad.]{.underline}

Towards a Cyber-Specific Treaty

A treaty specific to cyber operations is no novel idea. The treaty
approach was not adopted because the United States did not want to limit
its rich and multifaceted cyber-interventions abroad. But a failure to
pursue a treaty framework will likely come at the US's own peril. [Not
only the US, but also Russia and China have become major players in this
field. If one wishes to limit the damage the three can impose on each
other, some **agreement is required**]{.underline}. Perhaps
**[even]{.underline}** merely **[negotiating a cyber-treaty has some
value]{.underline}**. Such a process highlights controversies and
disagreement; at the same time, **[it "limits the arms race and paves
the way to peace."]{.underline}**

Back in 2012, Russia sought to conclude a treaty. At that time,
Vladislav P. Sherstyuk, deputy secretary of the Russian Security
Council, laid out what he described as Russia's "bedrock positions" on
disarmament in cyberspace. Russia's proposed treaty was modeled on the
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Russia proposed that such treaty
"would ban a country from secretly embedding malicious codes or
circuitry that could be later activated from afar in the event of war."
This emphasis was likely motivated by a desire to rebuke the US and
Israel for the famous Flame and Stuxnet malware that infiltrated Iranian
nuclear facilities' computer systems in 2010.

As Mary Ellen O'Connell and Louise Arimatsu explained in a report from
the same year, the US's resistance to proposals for a treaty may have
related to:

> "US plans to use the Internet for offensive purposes \[...\] U.S.
> officials claim publicly that Cyber Command is primarily defensive,
> but the reluctance to entertain the idea of a cyberspace disarmament
> treaty is raising questions about the true U.S. position."

In 2015, **[Russia and China signed a pact that includes a pledge not to
hack each other]{.underline}**, as well as provisions on law enforcement
cooperation and exchange of cybersecurity technologies. [While Russia
failed to get the US to agree on basic cyber-security principles, the
two other super-powers moved forward bilaterally.]{.underline}

To be sure, Russia's good intentions are nothing that we can opine about
(as we do not attempt to determine Obama's intentions). However, [even
if the commitment to the new cyber-specific treaty is **merely a matter
of optics**, it may seriously help **reducing risks**]{.underline}. To
understand how that might work, [consider the wisdom of]{.underline}
Sherstyuk's appeal to [the CWC]{.underline} in particular.

The Chemical Weapon Convention (CWC) Model for a Cyber-Treaty

The CWC is a 1997 arms-control convention, originally signed by 95
nations (188 as of today). Signatories pledged to eliminate chemical
weapons, their production facilities, as well as refrain from using
chemical weapons under any circumstances. The CWC also requires states
to adopt measures to implement the treaty. Signatories are required, for
example, to legislate statutes that penalize activities contrary to the
provisions of the treaty. Finally, the CWC establishes the Organisation
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which oversees the
adherence to the convention by carrying out inspections in the territory
of State parties. The establishment of the OPCW is truly the most
revolutionary aspect of the CWC.

The OPCW provides assistance to state parties. Among other work, it
engages in advocacy promoting the abolition of chemical weapons, and
provides assistance in the peaceful use of chemistry. In 2014, the OPCW
led the collection and elimination of Syrian chemical weapons. While
this operation has not clearly eliminated the threat of chemical weapons
in Syria, it certainly played an important role.

This could also be applicable to cyberspace. [A cyber-treaty based on
the CWC, would establish an independent organization to monitor
trans-boundary cyber activities]{.underline}, assist with real-time
ongoing cyber-attacks, and provide intelligence to attribute cyber
operations to a particular actor. This will be challenging, as
cyber-security is one of the most sensitive and classified parts of
contemporary national security. However, [a treaty-based organization
could opt for a representative structure and decision-making processes
that will protect its work from being monopolized by any one
super-power]{.underline}. Such an organization will also provide
training to officials of state parties that do not have the knowledge or
the means to acquire cyber security training.

The authority of the Organization will be naturally limited, but
**[serious violations may be submitted to the United
Nations]{.underline}**, whether the General Assembly, or in more serious
cases, the Security Council. The CWC rests on these assumptions. They
should also be incorporated in the cyber-treaty.

The CWC requires states to legislate appropriate laws to comply with the
stipulations of the Convention. A more recent example relevant to
cyberspace is the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime,
which requires states to adopt specific laws prohibiting illegal access,
data interference, computer related fraud, and more.

This model would work alongside the cyber-treaty intergovernmental
organization, and will provide some sort of common ground for policy,
since states parties will adopt similar domestic laws limiting the
development and use of cyber offensive techniques. For example, the
cyber-treaty could require states parties to adopt laws prohibiting
private companies and individuals from developing certain offensive
codes and techniques.

Finally, one of the CWC's main purposes is to differentiate between
desirable civilian uses of chemistry and the development of chemical
weapons. The idea is to prevent the latter while not discouraging the
former. This basic tenet too is applicable to the cyber realm, where
some research and new technologies may be very beneficial.

A Few Important Caveats

To be sure, adapting the CWC model (with relevant modifications) to
cyberspace will still not solve all threats and challenges. As David
Koplow has shown in an important work, both the US and Russia are
systematically violating key provisions of the CWC. Why would a
cyber-treaty modeled on the agreement fare any better?

[While]{.underline} key [players are expected to continue to search for
ways around their treaty-based duties]{.underline}, such **[a treaty
will advance cyber-peace and cooperation between states]{.underline}**.
[Russia has shown interest in developing such a treaty]{.underline},
while the US has not been particularly cooperative. **[Cyber offense is
a two-way road]{.underline}**. Back in 2012, Schneier explained this
very clearly: "We might have an offensive advantage---although that's
debatable---but we certainly don't have a defensive advantage." [Since
the US is planning to maintain its attacks and surveillance of other
states, it is likely to remain the target of similar

[Benefits of an ICWC for Strategic Deterrence]{.underline}

In this section, I have outlined several reasons for and potential
benefits of adopting an international convention to govern cyber
conflict. As I alluded to in the introduction to this article, these
reasons and benefits are contested by many scholars and practitioners.
Before turning to address objections to an International Cyberwar
Convention, however, it is worth briefly summarizing how an ICWC would
serve to improve strategic cyber deterrence. At the beginning of this
section, I argued that limitations of offensive cyber warfare dictate
that strategic deterrence in cyberspace must be based as much on denying
benefits to attackers (deterrence-by-denial) as on imposing costs via
forceful retaliation (deterrence-by-retaliation) (see Lindsay 2015). [By
improving information-sharing, establishing best practices, and
accelerating joint capacity building, an ICWC would help **strengthen
national cyber defenses** and make **national ICT systems more resilient
to attack**]{.underline}. Also, [by instituting early warning
mechanisms, an ICWC would lower the **likelihood that cyberattacks will
succeed**]{.underline}. As such, **[a convention would serve to
strengthen deterrence-by-denial]{.underline}** (on collective cyber
defense, see also Debar Dewar 2014, 14).

[An ICWC would also **improve deterrence-by-retaliation**]{.underline}.
As discussed, [for cyber deterrence to work, states must be able to
communicate clearly]{.underline} under what conditions a cyberattack
will trigger a retaliatory response, and at what level. [By clarifying
what counts an act of cyber-aggression and what level of retaliation is
deemed acceptable by the international community, an ICWC would thereby
enhance states' capacity to **adopt and communicate an effective
deterrent posture**]{.underline} (see esp. Carr 2011).

When considering the benefits of an ICWC with respect to strengthening
deterrence-by-retaliation, it is important to appreciate that [effective
retaliatory deterrence need not rest on a promise of immediate or
massive reprisals]{.underline}. Rather, **[what is required is a
credible promise]{.underline}** that attackers will be eventually
identified and some form of punishment dispensed. By instituting joint
management and oversight over the process of attribution and reprisal,
an ICWC would serve to slow down the process of retaliation. This would
have several benefits. First, a lengthier and more systematic process of
attribution and retaliation would reduce risks of conflict escalation by
leaving time for aggressors to either prove their innocence or agree to
voluntary compensation measures. Second, [by introducing joint
authorization of countermeasures, an ICWC would lower the
costs]{.underline} (both political and material) [of retaliation,
thereby **making retaliatory threats more credible**]{.underline}. Joint
authorization of countermeasures might also encourage collective
sanctions against transgressors and thereby introduce an element of
"extended deterrence" among parties to an ICWC. Third, [international
authorization of reprisals would make it feasible to widen reprisals
beyond narrow retaliation-in-kind]{.underline} (i.e., using offensive
cyber capabilities to strike back against an attacker's information
networks) [to encompass a wider range of punitive measures]{.underline}:
diplomatic, economic, and (in cases of grave assaults) military.
Cross-domain retaliation is currently advocated by many cyber experts,
since political and economic instruments are less sensitive to
revelation than "in-kind" retaliation (Lindsay 2015, 58) and may be more
potent against adversaries that lack sophisticated information networks
to retaliate against (Kugler 2009). However, reliance on cross-domain
retaliation would place high demands on the impartiality of attribution,
lest vague cyber threats come to serve as political justification for
economic sanctions (or even military strikes) against other nations.
This speaks strongly in favor of delegating attribution to an
independent international body.

Objection 1: The Impossibility of Monitoring and Enforcement

[The]{.underline} perhaps [most frequent objection to an international
treaty governing cyber conflict is that it would be impossible to
verify]{.underline} compliance or enforce the terms agreement (see Nye
2010; Clarke and Knake 2010; Lonergan 2016, 7--8; Schmitt and Vihul
2016, 44--45). As discussed, [cyber weapons are notoriously difficult to
monitor]{.underline}, mainly due to their dual-use nature and the fact
that they are easily concealed (Nye 2015b; Singer and Friedman 2014,
127). Since states would not wish to comply unless they were sure others
were complying, [critics argue, any international agreement seeking to
restrain states' cyber conduct would quickly unravel.]{.underline}

[When considering the force of this objection]{.underline}, the first
thing to [note]{.underline} is that **[problems of verification are
hardly unique to the cyber domain]{.underline}**. Take the example of
chemical and biological weapons. [Most precursors to chemical and
bacteriological weapons have a range of domestic and industrial uses,
and problems of "dual-use]{.underline}" (as well as a general inability
to distinguish offensive from defensive R&D programs) [have long plagued
both the]{.underline} Chemical Weapons Convention ([CWC]{.underline})
[and]{.underline} the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention
([BCW]{.underline}) (see Ifft 2005). **[Nonetheless, these problems have
for the most part been successfully addressed]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} a combination of highly detailed and strongly
obligatory **[prohibitions, stringent domestic implementation and
reporting requirements, intrusive international monitoring systems, and
high penalties for cheating]{.underline}** (for a discussion of the CWC,
see Eilstrup-Sangiovanni 2009). So far, [these institutional measures
have **deterred major transgressions**. There is no a priori reason to
assume a similar result could not be achieved in the cyber
domain]{.underline}. In fact, [the challenge of monitoring compliance
may in some ways present a **lesser obstacle to cooperation in the cyber
domain than in the realm of "traditional" nuclear and bio-chem
weapons**]{.underline}. Consider that the need for reliable
[verification]{.underline} of compliance with a cyberwar convention
[arises]{.underline} not ex ante with respect to weapons development and
possession, but rather [ex-post with respect to weapons use. This makes
an important difference]{.underline}. Due to the enormous and
irreparable damage that can be wrought by a single nuclear strike, the
bilateral treaties that dominated Cold War nuclear arms control focused
primarily on restricting the development and possession of nuclear
weapons and their means of delivery. By contrast, verifying and
attributing the use of nuclear weapons was never a concern. Once a
nuclear weapon is launched, there can be little doubt as to "who did
it"; the only relevant question is whether a victimized state has the
capacity to retaliate. The ability for states to monitor build-ups of
offensive capabilities is thus vital to nuclear arms control.

Cyber weapons present a different problem. [Since a cyberattack is
unlikely to cause as widespread or irreversible damage as a nuclear
attack, and since the ability of a victimized state to retaliate is
unlikely to depend on the speed with which a counter-attack can be
launched]{.underline} (or even on the ability to retaliate in kind),
[the main concern is not to monitor other states' possession of
offensive cyber weapons]{.underline} (which would admittedly be close to
impossible). Instead, [the thornier problem is to establish, ex post,
who is responsible for an attack]{.underline} and decide how to respond.
A **[joint attribution]{.underline}** mechanism overseen by an
international authority **[would greatly improve states' individual and
collective ability to decide such questions and would thus go a long way
towards solving the problem of monitoring and
enforcement]{.underline}**.

### AT: Delay\-\--2NC

#### Negotiation alone solves.

Objection 2: [An ICWC Would Take Too Long to Negotiate]{.underline}

[A second objection to a formal treaty is that it would take too
long]{.underline} to negotiate. According to Finnemore (2011, 93),
"negotiating treaties can be a slow and cumbersome process, ill-suited
to fast-changing issues like cyber security and Internet governance".
Negotiating the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea took more than a
decade, she observes. One might add that negotiations over the CWC,
signed in 1993, spanned several decades.Footnote32 It is important to
note, however, that whereas negotiations over UNCLOS and the CWC took
many years, in both cases, elements of norm gestation and informal
cooperation kicked off early in the negotiation process as individual
states sought to gradually bring their behavior into line with emergent
international norms. Indeed, experience from these and other
international treaty negotiations (such as the negotiations of the
International Landmine Ban Treaty) suggest that while international norm
creation and acceptance is generally a slow process, [the process is
often **accelerated by formal treaty negotiations which add political
weight and visibility to an issue**]{.underline}. [While the road to a
binding international agreement on cybersecurity may be long, embarking
on **negotiations might therefore by itself have a positive
impact**]{.underline}.

[Prospects for a Treaty]{.underline}

Judging from his rhetoric, [**Putin seems amenable** to an agreement to
rein in the cyber warfare]{.underline} shenanigans. [In September, he
asserted that \"one of today\'s major strategic challenges is the risk
of a large-scale confrontation in the digital field,\"]{.underline} as
conveyed to Newsweek by the Russian embassy in Washington.

**[Putin wants]{.underline}** to establish **[high-level communication
between Washington and Moscow]{.underline}** on \"international
information security,\" using existing agencies that deal with nuclear
and computer readiness. [He is]{.underline} also [in favor of
establishing new rules along the lines of U.S.-Soviet agreements on
**avoiding**]{.underline} maritime **[incidents and mutual \"guarantees
of non-intervention]{.underline}** into internal affairs of each
other.\"

In a reference to the nuclear weapons that dominated the Cold War
discourse on arms control, [Putin is also seeking a global agreement on
\"**no-first-strike**\" rules regarding **cyber attacks**]{.underline}
against communications systems, the embassy said.

Sullivan told reporters that nuclear talks remained the \"starting
point\" for bilateral discussions with Russia on cyber: \"Whether
additional elements get added to strategic stability talks in the realm
of space or cyber or other areas, that\'s something to be determined as
we go forward.\" Indeed, the joint statement on \"strategic stability\"
released by both sides after the meeting stuck strictly to nuclear arms,
with no references to cyber weapons.

Still, the talks made some progress on cyber warfare. While the Biden
administration has drawn no direct link between the recent ransomware
assault and the Kremlin, [U.S. officials have called on Russia to hold
hackers]{.underline} within its borders accountable for any attacks that
originate there. [Putin]{.underline} said during an interview with the
Rossiya-1 outlet that he [would agree to the extradition of those
arrested in Russia if the U.S. does the same; Biden has vowed to
reciprocate in the event such attacks were launched from U.S.
soil.]{.underline}

In some ways, [the Biden-Putin summit sends a signal that cyber warfare
has taken its place]{.underline} alongside other military technologies
as an accepted part of a nation\'s arsenal---[and one that **requires
international agreements to keep in check**]{.underline}. It also
underscores the crucial importance of information technology to national
defense.

MOSCOW, February 25. /TASS/. [Russia is interested in forging bilateral
agreements with the United States on **how to co-exist and interact in

\"[**Russia is always open for dialogue on the pressing issue of

a dialogue with Russia**]{.underline} irrespective of the domestic
political situation. The newly appointed US Ambassador to Moscow John
Sullivan was among those who recently voiced ideas of this kind,\" the
Russian diplomat said.

According to Krutskikh, [Moscow welcomes this approach and calls upon
its partners in Washington to \"restore a **normal, de-politicized
dialogue** on global information security between Russia and the United
States.\"]{.underline}

\"What [we need]{.underline} is not attempting to change each other's
political views, but **[to sit at the negotiating table and agree on how
we co-exist]{.underline}** and interact in the information space. Issues
on our present-day agenda are absolutely pressing, including
confidence-building measures in cyberspace and efforts against
cyber-terrorism and cyber-fraud,\" the high-ranking Russian diplomat
said.

Although Russia possesses an advanced capability that ranks among the
best in the world, its fundamental understanding of cybersecurity
diverges widely from that of the U.S. and NATO,\[108\] which creates
philosophical and conceptual [differences]{.underline} that
[pose]{.underline} real---albeit
**[surmountable]{.underline}**---[obstacles to constructive dialogue on
cyber issues]{.underline}. At present, a lack of common understanding
makes any discussion between Russia and the West on cyber topics, in the
words of one expert, an act of "mutual incomprehension and apparent
intransigence." \[109\] These [differences must be understood and
resolved for cooperation to bear fruit, which **can only be achieved
through regular dialogue and consistent interaction**]{.underline}, a
perspective reflected in the comment by the U.S. Secretary of State's
Coordinator for Cyber Issues Christopher Painter that "[We **need to
engage** with countries around the world, even with those with whom we
disagree]{.underline}." \[110\]

Rather than support the Budapest Convention, [Russia]{.underline} has
emphasized the need for a new international regime that more closely
corresponds to its views on cybersecurity. Russian officials and
academics consistently espouse a position that existing international
law is inadequate and that new accords are necessary to affirm national
sovereignty and deter aggressive behavior in cyberspace.\[121\] Their
[proposals]{.underline}, including the 2011 letter to the UN
Secretary-General it co-authored with China, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan,
[generally seem to]{.underline} share three aims: to constrain or limit
competing U.S. initiatives to develop norms in cyberspace, which they
view as a means of consolidating the U.S. competitive advantage in
cyberspace; to affirm the rights of countries to monitor and control the
flow of information over the Internet, which they see as essential to
ensuring domestic security; and to **[prevent the further development or
proliferation of offensive cyber weapons]{.underline}**. These tenets
contrast sharply with the Western emphasis on commitment to the free
flow of information, measures to combat cyber crime, and state
responsibility for Internet activity occurring within a country's
borders.\[122\] These **[differences might appear to be
irreconcilable]{.underline}** at first blush, limiting the odds of
achieving consensus on an international framework for cyber
operations.\[123\] [However, there are many points of agreement that
provide a starting point for cooperation -- on **securing supply chains,
protecting critical infrastructure, sharing information on threats, and
combating Internet use** by drug traffickers and
pedophiles]{.underline}.\[124\]

Why Would States Sign Up?

[The perhaps strongest argument against seeking a formal treaty to
govern international cyber conflict is that the insistence on binding
rules will mean that only a small group of highly committed states are
willing to sign on. Yet]{.underline}, if designed according to the
principles and purposes outlined in this article, **[an ICWC would in
fact offer a wide range of incentives for states to come on
board]{.underline}**. To begin, [intelligence-sharing and a joint
mechanism for attribution as outlined above would constitute **important
carrots**]{.underline} for many states, [as would access to technical
assistance and funding to help improve national **cyber defenses**. One
could imagine creating additional inducements to participation, such as
joint disaster response]{.underline}. For example, [a convention could
oblige states to assist other parties if they came under severe
cyberattack]{.underline}.Footnote36 Similarly, one could envisage a
multilateral fund for recovery and reconstruction which would provide
financial assistance and expertise to help states repair and rebuild
critical infrastructure after a cyberattack. In this regard, we can look
to existing arms control treaties as a model. The CWC provides various
forms of emergency assistance to state parties and establishes a
voluntary fund for "Assistance and Protection against Chemical
Weapons".Footnote37 The Technical Secretariat also helps to improve
national protection against chemical attacks by delivering detection
equipment and alarm systems, protective equipment, and technical
assistance to state parties.Footnote38 Together with active support for
compliance, [**these provisions have provided an important incentive for
states to participate**. Similar provisions in the cyber domain could
serve to encourage **buy-in by reluctant states.**]{.underline}
