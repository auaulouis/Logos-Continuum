Interference\". Just Security. 1-5-2017.

On Thursday, Senator [McCain will hold hearings]{.underline} of the
Armed Services Committee [on the Russian election hacking]{.underline}.
Several aspects of Russia's election interference raise issues involving
the international law of cyber operations. For a quick tutorial, I
recommend most highly an earlier Just Security post by Sean Watts,
"International Law and Proposed U.S. Responses to the D.N.C. Hack." I
thought to provide readers with a few additional points in light of more
recent developments.

1\. [Were the]{.underline} Russian [operations an "act of
war,"]{.underline} as Senator McCain recently stated?

Short answer: **[No]{.underline}**, none of the facts alleged by the
Obama administration with respect to the Russian operations would amount
to an "act of war" in any legal sense of what that term might mean. And,
yes [there is a fairly **settled understanding of what constitutes such
actions in cyber**.]{.underline}

Longer answer: [An "act of war"]{.underline} is, in this context, a
misplaced term. Sen. McCain's statement likely intended to [refer to an
"armed attack" under]{.underline} modern law on the resort to force
including [the UN]{.underline} Charter. [To cross the threshold of an
armed attack, the cyber operations must]{.underline} at the very least
[involve a "**use of force**."]{.underline} In an important speech in
2012, then-State Department Legal Adviser Harold Koh explained the US
view of when cyber operations involve the use of force: "[Cyber
activities that proximately result in **death**]{.underline}, injury,
**[or]{.underline}** significant **[destruction would]{.underline}**
likely **[be]{.underline}** viewed as a [**use of force**." That view is
**widely accepted by international legal experts**]{.underline} (see
posts by Mike Schmitt in the context of the Sony Hack and by Sean Watts
in the context of the DNC hack, explaining the consensus view.) And as
Sean Watts explained in his analysis, "[it is enormously difficult to
imagine a persuasive characterization of the D.N.C. hacks as either uses
of force or armed attacks]{.underline}."

One caveat: Technically speaking (and international law, to be sure, can
be hyper technical), Koh's remarks do not place a lower limit on what
constitutes a use of force in cyber. Or another way of putting that
point: his remarks do not state that such effects---"death, injury, or
significant destruction"---are a necessary condition for a cyber act to
constitute a use of force. Illustrating the point that a use of force
need not itself be destructive, in a case between the United States and
Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice characterized "arming and
training" rebels as "involving the use of force." (para. 228) That said,
for a lookback at historical US resistance to a broader conception of
"armed attack," I recommend Matt Waxman's "Cyber-Attacks and the Use of
Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)" in the Yale Journal of
International Law in 2011 (especially pages 427-30 & 437-40).

2\. Has the Obama administration called the Russian operations a
violation of international law?

Short answer: No.

Longer answer: All official statements by the Obama administration
appear to include a studied avoidance of whether the Russian actions do
or do not violate international law. Note this conspicuous line in the
President's statement on December 29: "These actions ... are a necessary
and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests in violation
of established international norms of behavior." Political scientists
talk about "international norms of behavior"---for international
lawyers, on the other hand, such terms do not connote an international
legal obligation. It is safe to assume the specific word choice in the
President's statement is highly deliberate.

The administration had another opportunity recently to label action like
the Russian DNC hack a violation of international law, but didn't. In
November, the State Department's Legal Adviser Brian Egan gave an
important speech on cyber and international law. In discussing this area
of law, his description of cyber activities that would violate a State's
international obligations would not match the hacking of the DNC. He
said:

> "For example, a cyber operation by a State that interferes with
> another country's ability to hold an election or that manipulates
> another country's election results would be a clear violation of the
> rule of non-intervention." (emphasis added)

Two caveats: First, as with Koh's speech, the Egan speech does not set
the outer limits of what action would violate the relevant legal rule.
It only gives two examples of "clear" violations. Second, one of the two
examples---a cyber operation "that manipulates another country's
election results"---might apply to hacking of election facilities (e.g.,
voting booths), of which Russians have also been accused. I suppose the
legal question may boil down to whether an operation intended to cast
grave public doubt on the integrity of the results would count, or if
the Egan speech is meant instead to refer to altering the actual
outcome.

3\. Why would the Obama administration not say whether the Russian
actions do or do not violate international law?

Short answer: There could be multiple different explanations.

Longer answer: Perhaps the administration lawyers did not reach a
consensus view on whether the actions violated international law.
Perhaps the administration reached the view that the Russian actions do
not amount to such a legal violation, and so did not say otherwise.
Perhaps the administration does think the Russian actions amount to a
legal violation, but there is no pressing reason to state it. Or perhaps
the administration is reluctant to assume the role of a victim, and
consequent appearances of weakness or vulnerability, in its
international relations with a recently resurgent Russia?

Also, talking about the law would open up questions about when, if ever,
U.S. cyber operations violate international law.

4\. **[What is at stake]{.underline}** in the question whether the
Russian actions violate international law?

There is no short answer.

First, if the Russian actions violated international law, [it could
**expand the scope of actions the United States could
take**]{.underline} in response. Under the international law on
"countermeasures," [the United States would be permitted to engage in
self-help measures that would themselves otherwise **violate
international law**]{.underline}. That is, [a State is permitted to
break international law to stop another State from breaking
international law]{.underline}, in some circumstances. (There are
conditions placed on the exercise of such measures, which I do not delve
into here.)

Over recent weeks, [[concern has been expressed that Russia might
launch]{.mark} hostile [cyber]{.mark} operations
[against]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the United States and other
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} members in parallel with a military campaign
against Ukraine. That military campaign is now fully underway.
[[This]{.mark} article [examines how]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the
feared [[Russian cyber operations would be characterized under
**international law**]{.underline}]{.mark} and outlines the response
options open to States targeted by them. [The [analysis
is]{.mark}]{.underline}, among other things, [**a [cautionary]{.mark}
note** [to those who]{.mark} would]{.underline} too readily [[jump to
describing]{.mark} such Russian [operations as an "**attack**" that
triggers]{.mark} the alliance's **[collective]{.mark}
self-[defense]{.mark} mechanism**]{.underline}. It is important to sort
through the more likely scenarios of Russian-led activity below that
threshold, as well as if that threshold is crossed. And [[it's important
to comprehend]{.mark} how [the **legal framework**]{.mark} applies to
Russian]{.underline} use of non-state actors to carry out such
[operations]{.underline}. All this and more in the analysis that
follows.

#### That [destabilizes international law]{.underline}\-\--allows [early use of force]{.underline}.

and Cyber Attacks: Sony v. North Korea\". Just Security. 12-17-2014.
https://www.justsecurity.org/18460/international-humanitarian-law-cyber-attacks-sony-v-north-korea/

[Pursuant to Article 51 of the UN]{.underline} Charter [and customary
**international law**, if the malicious cyber operation]{.underline}
against Sony had [constituted a "use of force" **rising to the level of
an "armed attack,"** the United States would have been entitled to
**respond forcefully**]{.underline}, whether by kinetic or cyber means.
The IGE unanimously agreed that cyber operations alone may be sufficient
to cross the armed attack threshold, particularly when they cause
substantial injury or physical damage. Some members of the group went
further by focusing not on the nature of the harm caused, but rather its
severity. In their view, a sufficiently severe non-injurious or
destructive cyber operation, such as that resulting in a State's
economic collapse, can qualify as an armed attack.

The [cyber operation]{.underline} against Sony [involved the release of
sensitive information and the destruction of data]{.underline}. In some
cases, the loss of the data prevented the affected computers from
rebooting properly. Albeit highly disruptive and costly, [such effects
are **not at the level most experts** would consider an **armed
attack**]{.underline}. Additionally, some States and scholars reject the
view that the right of self-defense extends to attacks by non-State
actors. Even though the attribution of the Sony incident to North Korea
has been questioned, this debate is irrelevant because [the operation
failed to qualify as an armed attack in the first place.]{.underline}

But was the operation nevertheless a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN
Charter and customary international law's prohibition on the use of
force by States such that it opened the door to responses other than
forceful ones? The prevailing view in international law is that "use of
force" is a lower threshold than "armed attack;" all armed attacks are
uses of force, but the reverse is not true. Unfortunately, after three
years of discussion, the IGE could arrive at no black letter definition
of a cyber use of force. Its members merely agreed that States would
make case-by-case assessments of non-injurious or destructive cyber
operations, considering such factors as severity, immediacy of effect,
invasiveness, military character, and so forth.

[Although]{.underline} the [use of force]{.underline} threshold [remains
ambiguous, it seems **highly unlikely** that the international community
will characterize operations like that against Sony as such. This
hesitancy will be driven in part by **concern over the U.S.
position**]{.underline} (a distinctly minority one) **[that all uses of
force are]{.underline}** also [**armed attacks** that allow forceful
responses. Some]{.underline} States [view the **premise** as potentially
**destabilizing**]{.underline} in that [it allows for an **earlier use
of force** than would otherwise be the case. They will]{.underline}
accordingly [be **extremely reticent** about characterizing cyber
operations as having **crossed that threshold**.]{.underline}

Interstate War: How Syrian Airstrikes Make the World Less Safe\".

War is in the air: figuratively and literally. Even before the air
strikes in Syria and the Russian veto of U.N. Security Council
Resolution condemning Syrian use of chemical weapons, President Trump's
[unpredictable and combative approach to foreign policy suggested a
**variety of paths** which could lead to **armed conflict** with
**Iran**, **China**, **Russia** or **North Korea** as]{.underline} Niall
[Ferguson]{.underline}, Robert [Kagan]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
Fareed [Zakaria]{.underline} have all [argued]{.underline}. In the
post-World War II period, [**international law** helped generate
**conditions** which led to **interstate peace**]{.underline}---**[the
"long peace."]{.underline}** Syrian airstrikes have, however, put
unprecedented [stress on the U.N.]{.underline} Charter-based
international legal system regulating the use of force. Perhaps the
result will be a more nuanced and better international legal system, one
which is carefully calibrated to permit the use of force in response to
humanitarian atrocities, as argued by Harold Koh and Rebecca Ingber. But
perhaps [**degradation of the U.N. Charter-based limitations** will
weaken the **international law prohibitions on the use of
force**]{.underline}, [making **regional or global conflict** with
**China**, **North Korea**, and **Russia** more likely]{.underline}.
Those proposing an erosion of the U.N. Charter system need to consider
carefully whether the international legal system is strong enough to
make nuanced use-of-force distinctions. The answer depends in part on
politics.

Viewed through a political lens, the prospects for a nuanced and
effective international legal prohibition on the use of force look dim.
[Relaxing the prohibition on the use of force is likely to **embolden
the territorial ambitions of Russia and China**]{.underline}; [it will
undermine the]{.underline} strength of the **[U.N. Security
Council]{.underline}**; [and it is especially difficult to administer in
a world of **fake news** and **hair-trigger
decision-making**]{.underline}. The Syrian atrocities cry out for a
response, but [now is a **dangerous time** to **tinker** with the **U.N.
Charter's prohibition on the use of force**]{.underline}.

It bears emphasizing that for almost a century, [the prevention of
interstate conflict has been the core objective of international
law]{.underline}. The League of Nations, established in the aftermath of
World War II was designed to manage great power politics but failed to
prevent World War II. That failure was shared by the 1928 Kellogg-Briand
pact which outlawed war for the first time. After World War II, the
victorious powers created the U.N. Charter and the Security Council with
its permanent veto-wielding members: China, France, Russia, United
Kingdom, United States. Note the continuing importance of those five
powers. [The Charter ushered in a remarkable "**Long
Peace**"]{.underline}---meaning [a dramatic reduction in **inter-state
armed conflict**. The **cornerstone of the U.N.**]{.underline} Charter
and of the international legal order since 1945 [is a **prohibition on
use of force** except in self-defense]{.underline} or as authorized by
the Security Council. [The "Long Peace" suggests that it has
worked]{.underline}: not to prevent all conflicts, but [to prevent
**many inter-state conflicts**, which is the type of conflict **building
now**.]{.underline}

Using the Syrian airstrikes to craft a humanitarian exception to the
prohibition on the use of force puts the "Long Peace" under
unprecedented stress. To be sure, the 1999 NATO bombing of Kosovo for
humanitarian purposes violated Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. But the
Syrian airstrikes, which involved the U.S. acting alone and without
exhausting the avenues for peaceful resolution of the issue, represents
a significant expansion of the Kosovo precedent, as analyzed by Ashley
Deeks here.

There are several reasons to think that [a limited]{.underline} and
fine-tuned humanitarian **[exception to the prohibition on the use of
force will not work]{.underline}**. First, [it will
**embolden**]{.underline} the already emboldened **[territorial
aspirations of Russia and China]{.underline}**. After the bombing
campaign and with the strong support of Western European countries and
the United States, Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008.
Serbia and its allies, especially Russia, strongly condemned the
declaration of independence and continue today to refuse to recognize
Kosovo. [Russian officials]{.underline}, then, in turn [used the Kosovo
precedent to support its use of force in both Georgia and
Ukraine]{.underline}. Crimea, which was part of Ukraine, is today
Russian. The core threat to peace with Russia is probably---Syria
notwithstanding---the increasingly militarized borders between NATO (or
NATO-allied) countries and Russia, which includes thousands of NATO
troops, the most since the end of the Cold War. [The **South China Sea**
is probably the world's leading conflict-prone
area]{.underline}---[China's territorial ambitions there may explain its
uncharacteristic reluctance to criticize U.S. airstrikes]{.underline} in
Syria. [These political facts should give pause to those who seek a
carefully-calibrated prohibition on the use of force.]{.underline}

Second, Syrian airstrikes undermine the United Nations Security Council,
which did not authorize them, either ex ante or ex post. But [the
Security Council is a key forum for resolving **other threats to
interstate peace**, such as **Iran** and **North Korea**]{.underline}.
China, which is widely viewed as the key to containing North Korea, has
recently highlighted its participation in developing the U.N. Security
Council Resolutions designed to deter North Korean nuclear and missile
programs. After all, [international law provides the basis for imposing
sanctions on North Korea to limit its nuclear ambitions. International
law serves core North Korean objectives]{.underline}, too, as [it
prevents Western military intervention, a fear motivating North Korean
policy]{.underline}. The Syrian precedent gives [North
Korea]{.underline} reason to [worry that the U.S. will attack even over
a Chinese veto in the Security Council]{.underline}. As with North
Korea, [international law strongly supports U.S. policy objectives of
preventing a nuclear-armed Iran]{.underline}. Sanctions imposed by the
United Nations Security Council led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action, which relaxed sanctions in return for Iranian concessions on
its nuclear program. [**Undermining the U.N. Security Council makes
peace more difficult to achieve** in this context, too]{.underline}.

Third, President Trump's destabilizing leadership is the immediate cause
of many dire scenarios forecasting war; such leadership makes exceptions
to Article 2(4) especially dangerous and especially difficult to limit.
President Trump's use of force in Syria illustrates how hard it is to
categorize such interventions as "one-off" incidents (on this point, see
the exchange between Monica Hakimi and Anthea Roberts over at
EJIL:Talk!) or to define their precedential impact in narrow terms. The
very factors that were supposed to limit the Kosovo precedent, including
the participation of a regional security organization such as NATO,
failed to constrain the primary architect of those very limitations: the
United States itself. [A]{.underline} nuanced and [fine-tuned set of
factors justifying the use of force is **hard to administer** in a world
of **trigger-happy, truth-challenged leaders**.]{.underline}

One question to consider is whether we have been too quick to strip
cyber conflict from its political context. [Given the **limitations of
deterrence**]{.underline}, a nation like [the United
States]{.underline}, [which is uniquely vulnerable]{.underline}, [would
**gain more by creating international norms**]{.underline}. [These
actions would change the deterrent calculus]{.underline} (by [reducing
the likelihood of success for an opponent]{.underline} in launching a
cyber attack [and]{.underline} by [increasing the cost]{.underline} of
being caught) **[in ways]{.underline}** that that are **[not achievable

Paradigm Of Non-Intervention."
https://jilp.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/volume-27-1/27.1_ZHAO.pdf

[Scholars]{.underline} have [attempted to update the use of force
paradigm to account for]{.underline} emerging [cyber operations like
CDOs]{.underline}. However, Article 2(4) seems ill-suited as a solution
to CDOs. [The "use of force"]{.underline} in Article 2(4) [has long been
read as containing **physical violence**]{.underline} or resulting in
physical harm. This is distinct from other forms of coercion that
generally fall under the customary international norm of
non-intervention; [such interpretation also represents the
**longstanding position of the U.S.**]{.underline}53 There were also
significant historical debates over whether or not to clearly define the
term "use of force." One such contention took place in the preparation
of UN General Assembly Resolution 2625, the Declaration on Principles of
International Law Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States
adopted in 1970.54 The Report of the Special Committee on Resolution
262555 unfolded the debate over the definition of "force" in detail.
Multiple states had jointly proposed to insert a broad definition of the
term "force" in Resolution 2625, such that "force" would include not
only military force, but also "all forms of pressure, including those of
a political and economic character, which have the effect of threatening
the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."56
Some suggested that forms of pressure exercised on ideological and
religious grounds should thus be prohibited.57

However, [no agreement was reached by members to]{.underline} either
include a definition of "force" in the Resolution 2625 statement or to
[expand "use of force" to cover any form of pressure against the
political independence or territorial integrity]{.underline} of a state.
[Some representatives would only understand the term "force" to mean
**exclusively "armed force."**]{.underline} 58 Consequently, no
definition of "force" was provided in the Declaration on Friendly
Relations. The standard for non-belligerent inter-state actions was
instead provided in the principle of non-intervention, a principle that
I will further discuss.

In any case, in spite of the fact that ambiguity remains in whether
pressure exercised through cyber means could amount to "use of force,"
**[it is unlikely that General Assembly members would agree on elevating
cyber meddling to the status of "use of force."]{.underline}** Article
2(4)'s [prohibition against "use of force" has so far been a **standard
of physical violence, not contemplating actions that are short of
military natures**. To re-propose the expanded definition of "use of
force" to cover CDOs is currently **unattainable**]{.underline}, given
that **[the extended definition would result in significant and unwanted
ramifications on the legality of other forms of economic and political
pressures, and on the rights of self-defense]{.underline}** and
countermeasures.

A. [Victim States of CDOs Have No Legal Recourse in the United
Nations]{.underline} Charter Article 2(4)

[The lawfulness of]{.underline} resorting to **[military
measures]{.underline}**, the jus ad bellum, [is regulated by the Charter
of United Nations]{.underline} Article 2(4). Article 2(4) provides that
"[all members shall refrain in their international relations from the
threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any state]{.underline}."48 No definitions are provided
in the Charter, however, for the key terms, "use of force" and
"political independence," except for a mentioning in the preamble that
one purpose of the Charter is to "ensure...that armed force shall not be
used, save in the common interest."49 It is altogether unclear if "use
of force" in Article 2(4) implies a use of armed force, and it would be
imprudent to draw such a definite conclusion as arguments were made that
use of force is "a large category of activities containing a smaller
subset of events that qualify as armed subset."50

[CDOs]{.underline}, while capable of asserting broad influence on the
target states, [can hardly fall under the category of armed
force]{.underline}. Furthermore, **[a CDO rarely amount to a "use of
force,]{.underline}**" even when the term arguably covers operations
less grave than armed force. Regardless of the scope of use of force,
[incursions into a nation's political independence in the form of CDOs
have an "ostensibly peaceful" façade that is non-belligerent in
nature]{.underline}, and therefore are "seldom broadly accepted as uses
of force."51 [The worry of counting CDOs as "use of force,"]{.underline}
other than it is counter-intuitive to the plain language, is that the
effect of CDOs might be disproportionate to that of belligerent military
actions (the traditional understanding of "use of force"). Consequently,
**[counting CDOs as "use of force" might trigger a state's
countermeasures disproportionate to what CDOs deserve]{.underline}**,
[in forms of]{.underline} draconian economic sanctions or even
**[military actions]{.underline}**, [especially when the effect of CDOs
is **extremely hard to measure**]{.underline} as I will discuss in later
sections.

[Western scholars generally classify cyber operations as a use of armed
force if the attack directly or indirectly results in damage to physical
property or causes injury or loss of life]{.underline} (Harrison Dinniss
74). In instances where the operation does not clearly cause physical
damage, injury, or loss of life, the IGE provides eight criteria to
determine if a cyber operation has reached the threshold of "use of
force." These criteria include severity, immediacy, directness,
invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state
involvement, and presumptive legality (Schmitt 334-36). The elements
must be taken as a collection of circumstances for a state to make a
determination on use of force.

**[Most cyber operations fall below the use of force
threshold]{.underline}**. However, Operation Olympic Games is clearly
determined to meet the use of force threshold. The US operation
continuously caused [physical damage]{.underline} to Iran's
infrastructure over a period of years. This [is a clear violation of UN
Charter]{.underline}, Article 2(4). [However]{.underline}, in order for
Iran [to maintain the legal right to self-defense, the operation would
have to classify as an "**armed attack**"]{.underline}

[The Russian election meddling]{.underline} operation **[cannot be
categorized as an armed attack]{.underline}** under the framework of
Tallinn Manual 2.0 [because no physical damages were inflicted on
persons or objects. This operation is a **much weaker case under the
current international law**]{.underline} framework [than]{.underline}
that of the Stuxnet operation, [where physical
property]{.underline}----thousands of Iranian centrifuges----[was
damaged]{.underline} and disabled.59 If the Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts
could not reach a consensus on whether Stuxnet qualified as an armed
attack, **[the DNC hack is]{.underline}** even more **[unlikely to be
considered]{.underline}** as such.

The "scale and effects" analysis is even more unlikely to qualify the
DNC hack as an armed attack.60 Although the Mueller investigation and
indictments against Russian individuals have provided much more
information, the actual effects of the hack are still almost
unmeasurable.61 [The way that the Russian election interference operated
in influencing the information environment]{.underline}----essentially
spreading narratives and messages that were false but also subscribed to
by certain American groups, such as the subscribers of Infowars----[made
it hard for analysts to figure out (1) which parts of the information
environment before the 2016 election was created by Russian trolls and
(2) which parts originated in the United States.]{.underline}

[Categorizing the Russian DNC hack as an armed attack might]{.underline}
also [invite]{.underline} an escalation of cyber conflict by
**[triggering Article 5 of]{.underline}** the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ("**[NATO]{.underline}**") Charter,62 which calls for a
collective response from all NATO States. It could alienate NATO
partners to put the entirety of NATO in a confrontation with Russia over
an election meddling operation that caused no physical damage. After
all, Estonia, even after suffering a much stronger attack from Russia in
2007 that temporarily disabled a large percentage of its Internet
system, did not invoke Chapter 5 for these considerations.63

Under Tallinn Manual 2.0 standards, [the DNC attack is also unlikely to
qualify as a use of force for two reasons]{.underline}.
[First]{.underline}, on its face, [the Russian operation is closer to
"non**-destructive cyber psychological operations** intended solely to
undermine confidence in a government,"]{.underline}64 **[which does not
constitute a use of force]{.underline}**, than the Stuxnet operation,
which, again caused damages on a large amount of State property.

[Second, the "scale and effect" factors]{.underline} drawn from Tallinn
Manual 2.0 also [support the same conclusion that the Russian operation
does not constitute a use of force:]{.underline}

> 1\. [Severity]{.underline}: [Weak]{.underline}. [No harm or

[Although some]{.underline} of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 factors seem to
[support categorizing the Russian Hack as a use of force, the most
important factor in the analysis]{.underline}----the
[severity]{.underline} of the effects caused by the cyber
operation----**[does not]{.underline}**. [The non-violent nature of the
operation makes a use of force categorization **extremely
difficult**]{.underline}. Being able to attribute a cyber operation that
had certain unquantifiable effects on the 2016 elections to the Russian
government does not seem to raise the operation to the level of a use of
force because it would not effectively distinguish this operation from
other lower level offenses under international law, such as prohibited
intervention, which will be discussed in later parts of this Article.

One way to increase the severity of the effects of the Russian operation
as a matter of law would be categorizing the election system as
"critical infrastructures"68 and treating meddling with the elections
akin to tampering with a major dam or an electrical grid. However, the
DNC servers are not related to the election itself, but are instead used
to promote the interest of a private organization, the Democratic Party.
Therefore, even if the election system is categorized as a critical
infrastructure as a matter of law, Congress must go the extra mile to
consider ways to protect private entities like the DNC to respond to
cyber operations like the DNC hack in the future. Either way,
classifying the election system as critical infrastructure was
unavailable for both the Obama and the Trump Administrations because
such classification was not in place before the Russian operation.

**[Self-defense would not have been a measure available to the United
States]{.underline}** to respond to the Russian DNC hack in 2016. This
is because [the operation amounts to neither an armed attack nor a use
of force **under customary international law,**]{.underline} as
reflected in Tallinn Manual 2.0. The Russian operation, however, could
have been categorized as violating other aspects of international law,
to which the United States may respond by either invoking the plea of
necessity69 or imposing countermeasures.70 I will next discuss the legal
requirements and the applicability of invoking the plea of necessity.

Challenges at Yale Law School. \"Towards a Cyber-Security Treaty\". Just

This is because [the laws of war are inapplicable to most cyber
operations. The DNC Hack]{.underline}, for example, **[did not cause any
physical destruction or bodily harm]{.underline}**. [It therefore does
not reach the **severity threshold** that justifies]{.underline} the
resort to **[self-defense]{.underline}** measures (ad bellum) or the law
of armed conflict (in bello). What remains, as a matter of international
law, is the general norm of non-intervention, which does not say much
about hostile state-sponsored activities in cyberspace.

#### Election hacking is not an armed conflict.

U.S. election is not an act of war, cyber expert says\". Washington

[Russia's hacks]{.underline} of the Democratic National Committee
[and]{.underline} its [election meddling were alarming, but **not an act
of war**]{.underline}, [said a leading scholar of **international law in
cyber operations**]{.underline}.

"I'm no friend of the Russians," said Michael Schmitt, chairman of the
U.S. Naval War College's International Law Department and director of a
project that analyzes how international law applies to cyber operations
--- especially in peacetime.

But [Moscow's hacking]{.underline} and dumping of Democratic emails to
WikiLeaks "[is not an initiation of armed conflict. **It's not a
violation of the U.N. Charter's prohibition on the use of force**. It's
not a situation that would allow the U.S. to respond in **self-defense
militarily**]{.underline}."

Schmitt spoke in an interview with The Washington Post coinciding with
the release of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, an updated reference for lawyers
around the world on how international law applies to cyberspace.
Schmitt, who is also a law professor at the University of Exeter in
Britain, led the legal team that compiled the manual.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, has said he believes Russia's interference in the 2016
presidential election amounted to an act of war.

Nonetheless, Schmitt said, Russia's apparent attempt to influence the
outcome of the election by its release of emails through WikiLeaks
probably violates the international law barring intervention in a
state's internal affairs. And that would give the United States grounds
to undertake "countermeasures" that would otherwise be unlawful, he
said.

The updated Tallinn Manual explores cyber actions most commonly
confronted by states today: espionage, denial of service disruptions and
influence operations --- actions that fall short of armed conflict and
the use of force.

"The Russians are masters at playing the gray areas" of law, said
Schmitt, arguing that the Kremlin is adept at carrying out operations
that fall short of breaching undisputed legal red lines that would
invite robust responses. For instance, [Moscow has not conducted
operations in the United States that cause deaths or
significant]{.underline}, nationwide economic [harm that would warrant
the use of force in response.]{.underline}

[Hacking]{.underline} the DNC's emails [is an act of political
espionage, **which is not a breach of international law**]{.underline},
Schmitt said.

Aside 2: The Application of [International Humanitarian Law]{.underline}

[[Irrespective of whether]{.underline}]{.mark} prospective [[Russian
cyber]{.mark} operations [might constitute]{.mark} an internationally
[wrongful act]{.mark}, [the question remains whether they]{.mark} might
[initiate]{.mark}]{.underline}, in lay terms,
"**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**" between Russia and the targeted State.
[In international law, we call that]{.underline} an "[international
armed conflict]{.underline}" -- [and [it brings into operation
**i**]{.mark}**nternational [h]{.mark}umanitarian
[l]{.mark}aw**]{.underline} (eg the Geneva Conventions) to regulate the
belligerents' conduct, including the operation itself. An international
armed conflict occurs when there are hostilities between two or more
States. The nature and severity of the requisite hostilities are
contentious, especially with respect to cyber operations that may not be
destructive or deadly. (Tallinn Manual 2.0, rule 82).

It is unfortunate that the lay term for such situations is "war." [[It
is crucial that diplomats]{.mark}, commentators and others [keep
distinct the **legal understanding**]{.mark} that an "international
armed conflict" may exist]{.underline} between two States because of the
introduction of force, [but that [force may not rise to]{.mark} the
level of an "[**armed attack**" triggering the **right to**
]{.mark}**exercise self-[defense]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Causation of]{.underline} significant [[physical damage]{.mark} or
death]{.underline} in the target State [[would]{.mark} likely
[qualify]{.mark} as an international armed conflict]{.underline}.
However, States have been reticent about treating even cyber operations
causing physical damage or necessitating replacement of cyber
infrastructure, such as those launched by Iran into Saudi Arabia against
Saudi Aramco, as such. In any event, [[it is unlikely]{.mark} that
potential [Russian cyber operations would be]{.mark} at a level
[triggering]{.mark} an **international [armed conflict]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}between Russia and the target State. The more likely scenario
for triggering an international armed conflict is a kinetic
engagement]{.underline} between Russian and NATO military forces
deployed forward, for instance, in the Baltic States. At that point, an
international armed conflict would exist, and international humanitarian
law would govern cyber operations with a nexus to that conflict.

#### ICJ rulings prove\-\--attacks must cause physical damage to be acceptable under international law.

https://www.justsecurity.org/80347/expert-backgrounder-nato-response-options-to-potential-russia-cyber-attacks/

Acting in [self-defense is the least likely response]{.underline}. That
is because [a Russian cyber operation crossing the required threshold of
an "armed attack" is]{.underline} the **[least likely to
occur]{.underline}**. [Article 51 of the United Nations]{.underline}
Charter [provides, "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair
the]{.underline} inherent [right of]{.underline} individual or
collective self-[defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of
the United Nations]{.underline}, until the Security Council has taken
measures necessary to maintain international peace and security."
[Customary international law is generally in accord]{.underline}. Under
the law of State responsibility, the right of self-defense is a
"circumstance precluding wrongfulness," that is, a situation in which a
State may engage in otherwise unlawful conduct to defend itself
(Articles on State Responsibility, art. 21). Most importantly, the right
of self-defense allows States facing an armed attack to use force in
their defense. That force may be cyber or kinetic, and the response need
not be in kind; kinetic force may be used to respond to a cyber armed
attack and vice versa (Tallinn Manual 2.0, rule 71).

Of course, [States may defend themselves against a cyber "armed
attack."]{.underline} [But]{.underline} in the current context, the
right of collective defense looms even larger. That is because some of
the NATO States that Russian cyber operations might target cannot mount
an effective defense on their own.

In this regard, Senator Mark [Warner]{.underline}, the Senate
Intelligence Committee Chairman, has [suggested the prospective Russian
cyber operations could trigger **Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty**]{.underline}. In relevant part, the article provides:

> The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
> Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
> and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each
> of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective
> self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United
> Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
> forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such
> action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
> restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

NATO has repeatedly confirmed that the right of self-defense applies in
cyberspace. Accordingly, [the question is whether the possible Russian
cyber operations might rise to the level of an "**armed attack**" under
UN]{.underline} Charter Article 51 [and]{.underline}, therefore, Article
5 of [the North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}.

[The **prevailing view** is that]{.underline}, [in the words of the
International Court of Justice]{.underline} in Nicaragua, [an armed
attack is the "most grave form" of a use of force]{.underline}. Thus,
[the scale and effects of any Russian cyber operations would have to be
**especially severe before triggering**]{.underline} the right of
individual or **[collective]{.underline}** self-**[defense. Physical
damage or death might need to occur]{.underline}** before consensus on
classification as an armed attack could be achieved. That said, at least
one NATO member, France, has taken a broad view suggesting a cyber
operation would be an armed attack "if it caused substantial loss of
life or considerable physical or economic damage."

[The emerging consensus is that a cyberspace attack produces the
equivalent effect of an armed attack using physical means. If an
incident doesn\'t produce damage, destruction, or casualties, it\'s
**not an attack**. A gray area exists]{.underline} when deciding when
the disruption of services and data rises to the level of damage or
destruction equivalent to the use of force, but [the simplest approach
is to reason by analogy and ask whether the cyberincident creates damage
equal to a kinetic attack. **An effects-based definition sets a clear
threshold**]{.underline}.

[The definitions of the use of force and armed attack are not provided

argument on a case concerning [Nicaragua, the International Court of
Justice rejected a narrow interpretation of \"use of force\" that limits
the term to the employment of either kinetic force or non-kinetic
operations generating comparable effects. The Court held that a state\'s
arming and training of guerrilla forces engaged in hostilities against
another state qualified as a use of force, a position that has since
**become widely accepted**]{.underline}.\'\" [The logic of the holding

[action **would not amount to a use of force**]{.underline}; nor would
financing a rebel group\'s cyber operations. [Beyond]{.underline} these

[Violating another State's sovereignty is a breach of an international
obligation, which allows]{.underline} the victim State to respond with
[countermeasures]{.underline}.128 [It may seem intuitive to accuse the
Russian government of violating the sovereignty of the United States by
engaging in cyber operations]{.underline} that intended to undermine a
major national election. However, **[a close examination of
international law does not support this argument.]{.underline}**

Customary international law defines sovereignty as something that
signifies "\[i\]ndependence in regard to a portion of the globe as the
right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the
functions of a State,"129 indicating two major aspects of sovereignty:
territorial integrity and State functions.130 A violation of either
aspect amounts to a violation of State sovereignty.

First, with regard to territorial integrity, Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts
agreed that a remotely conducted cyber operation causing either physical
damage to objects (both private and governmental) or injury to persons
violates sovereignty.131 In the cyber context, damage to objects not
only means physical damage, but also a loss of functionality, as
dysfunction of cyberinfrastructure is often the result of hostile cyber
operations.132 However, [Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts disagreed on the
extent of the loss of functionality required to qualify as a violation
of territorial integrity]{.underline}.133 **[Some insisted that there
must be an irreversible loss of function]{.underline}**, while, for
others, altering or deleting data stored in the cyberinfrastructure
would suffice, even if the loss of functionality might be temporary and
restorable.134 An example of the former position would be the Stuxnet
operation, which destroyed thousands of Iranian centrifuges,135 while a
major denial-of-service attack would suffice the latter position.136
However, [with respect to the Russian election meddling, neither of the
positions above are likely to establish a violation of sovereignty
because **no known damage or loss of functionality was caused to
information and communication technology in the United
States**]{.underline}.

Second, [a remote cyber operation amounting to an interference of
inherently governmental functions also violates the sovereignty of the
victim State]{.underline}.137 Holding national elections would be a
classic example of an inherently governmental function, which States
enjoy the exclusive right to perform.138

[However]{.underline}, as a matter of international law, [it is
**unclear exactly what cyber activities amount to an illegal
"interference" of such function**]{.underline}. The extreme cases are
clear. On the one hand, a cyber operation that affects public voting
infrastructures, such as voting machines or voting registration systems,
would be a clear interference of inherently governmental functions.139
On the other hand, [Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts agreed that]{.underline}
**[political propaganda during foreign elections would not amount to an
illegal interference]{.underline}** because prevalent opinio juris does
not treat hostile political propaganda as a violation of sovereignty.140

4\. Breach of Legal Obligations: Illegal Intervention

The [intervention in another State's internal affairs is the second
internationally wrongful act that the United States might be able to
allege against Russia in order to use countermeasures]{.underline}.
[Illegal intervention consists of two elements under customary
international law]{.underline}: (1) the [operation must have an effect
on the internal affairs]{.underline} that are part of the victim State's
domaine reserve [and]{.underline} (2) [the effect of the operation must
be coercive]{.underline}.144 Similar to the violation of sovereignty, an
operation of illegal intervention can target both private and
governmental entities145 and can only be committed by a State actor.146

As the ICJ explained in the Nicaragua judgment, [domaine reserve refers
to "matters in which each State is permitted by the principle of
sovereignty]{.underline}, to decide freely. . . . \[F\]or example, the
choice of a political . . . system."147 Employing coercive measures
regarding such choices amounts to a wrongful intervention as a matter of
international law.148 For the purposes of this Article, a national
election clearly falls into the category of domaine reserve. [The
determinative question is whether the Russian election meddling
operation was **coercive**.]{.underline}

[Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts agreed]{.underline} that coercion "refers to
an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of
choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or
involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way."149 Also,
"[coercion must be distinguished from **persuasion**]{.underline},
criticism, public diplomacy, \[and\] propaganda"150 because, different
from coercion, "such activities merely involve either influencing (as
distinct from factually compelling) the voluntary actions of the target
State or seek no action on the part of the target State at all."151 The
exact standard of coercion, however, is still underdeveloped. Just like
the violation of sovereignty, the extreme cases on both ends of the
spectrum are clear: in the election context, an attack disabling the
voting infrastructure to prevent voters from casting their ballots would
be an example of coercion, while mere espionage or propaganda campaigns
would not amount to prohibited intervention as a matter of international
law. 152

Therefore, the [hacking]{.underline} of [the DNC servers, disseminating
the information collected from the hacking, and the propaganda campaign
on both social media and the Russian State media would **not constitute
coercive acts**. None of these activities compelled the
voters]{.underline} to engage in involuntary actions or inactions, but,
rather, **[they were simply influencing and persuading the voters to act
in a certain way.]{.underline}**

Article 41 permits the use of measures that do not reach the use of
force threshold, including "complete or partial interruption of economic
relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other
means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations"
(United Nations \"Charter of the United Nations\"). If Article 41
measures are not sufficient or are inadequate, [the Security Council may
authorize use of force]{.underline} measures by "air, sea, or land
forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace
and security" (United Nations \"Charter of the United Nations\").

[The likelihood of the Security Council making this determination and
authorizing such measures is **miniscule**]{.underline} for two reasons.
[First]{.underline}, in the previous decade, [the **UN Security Council
has not considered cyber operations of any type to be a threat to the
peace**]{.underline}, a breach of peace, or an act of aggression.
[Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon implored the Security
Council]{.underline} at its 6277th meeting in 2010 [to consider
cybercrimes]{.underline} an emerging threat to international peace. [The
Security Coucil made no response]{.underline} to the request and cyber
operations have not been mentioned in Council meetings related to
Article 39 since that date (United Nations \"Repertoire of the Practice
of the Security Council\"). Secondly, [three of the most pervasive state
cyber actors are permanent members of the Security Council with veto
power. **China, Russia**, and the United States are **unlikely to put
forth any resolutions that limits their ability to maneuver in
cyberspace**. As they use cyber operations]{.underline} that become
closer and closer to the threshold of the use of force or an armed
attack, [they will be less likely to specifically name state cyber
operations a threat to the peace or an act of aggression]{.underline}.

The question then arises: [does the lack of capacity to deter
non-military hybrid cyber activities suggest that it is time for NATO to
renegotiate the scope]{.underline} and substance [of]{.underline} its
**[collective defence]{.underline}** clause?65 [When it comes to
cyberspace, the next section expresses **scepticism**]{.underline} about
expanding NATO's role. [It addresses the **escalation
risk**]{.underline} associated **[with]{.underline}** having
**[NATO]{.underline}**, an organization that has refocused its attention
on a more traditional military threat, **[become a more active player
below the threshold]{.underline}** of collective defence. It argues that
[a more active stance outside military confrontation risks **undermining
the intelligence norm** that currently dominates in
cyberspace]{.underline}---a norm whereby [state activity in foreign
networks is not considered escalatory]{.underline}.

Escalation and the dominant intelligence norm

[The large overlap between intelligence collection and attack in
cyberspace makes it **difficult to send clear signals**]{.underline} to
adversaries, in terms of either capabilities or intentions. When a
foreign entity is moving around in a network, is it then about to start
a military operation? Is the activity part of a reconnaissance mission?
Is it political or economic espionage? Is it active defence? The
difficulty of answering these questions has created much nervousness
among cyber-conflict experts. Ben Buchanan, for example, has shown how
[defensive hacking or intelligence-gathering in cyberspace is easily
misinterpreted as aggressive behaviour]{.underline}.66
**[Why]{.underline}**, then, **[have we not experienced serious
misinterpretation and escalation]{.underline}** in cyberspace?

One way to explain this is through [the existence and dominance of a
largely unspoken but]{.underline} widely [accepted
**norm**]{.underline}. For decades, [the predominant actors in
cyberspace have been intelligence agencies; and the norms]{.underline}
that characterize interactions between intelligence agencies [are not
primarily concerned with military concepts such as conflict escalation
and deterrence]{.underline}.67 In the world of intelligence agencies,
success is not about keeping a distance between oneself and the
adversary by signalling one's intentions and capabilities. It is about
being able to outmanoeuvre adversaries in a space of constant contact.68
There are always risks, and the work usually takes place in legal grey
zones where a clear distinction between war and peace is not the guiding
principle. This [is an arena where the opportunity to annoy, cheat and
delay opponents is taken when it arises]{.underline}. In short,
**[espionage and counter-espionage do not fit well with the thorough
military operational planning that characterizes NATO
operations]{.underline}**. Intelligence operations, on the other hand,
fit perfectly with a dynamic cyberspace where anonymity is easy to
achieve and uncertainty a constant condition.69 The states that embrace
cyberspace as a domain where the intelligence norm dominates are able to
use a broader array of tools to pursue or respond to various foreign
political objectives than only those that relate to military operations.

In its 2018 'vision', the US Cyber Command built implicitly on the
dominant intelligence norm. Here, the objective is to become more agile
and act as close to the adversary as possible ('defend forward').70 The
United States considers 'constant contact' and 'persistent engagement'
as the necessary guiding principles to achieve superiority in cyberspace
and to take full advantage of the broader potential for pursuing its
political objectives through cyberspace. During the 2018 US midterm
elections, for example, the US Cyber Command worked closely with the NSA
to disrupt servers operated by the Russian Internet Research Agency
aiming to spread fake news and stir up tension in the United States.71
More recently, the US Cyber Command responded with various cyber effects
against Iran after the Iranian Revolutionary Guards apparently placed
mines on ships in the Strait of Hormuz.72 These practices illustrate
that, for the United States, cyber effects provide political options
when one does not want to escalate existing tensions into military
confrontation. Defensive coordination between allies through CYOC
supports such defensive use of cyber effects, increasing the possibility
that US Cyber Command will be allowed to 'defend forward' and work
persistently through allied networks.73 A more cyber-active NATO,
however, risks being counterproductive to the ambition to 'defend
forward' through allied networks.

[Unintended conflict escalation from ongoing cyber activity is mainly a
risk if **military analysts**]{.underline}---in a strategic environment
with heightened attention to military confrontation---[**ignore the
dominant intelligence norm**. If that happens, it becomes more likely
that 'persistent engagement' and active cyber defence will be
misinterpreted as military preparation]{.underline}, armament or the
initial phase of an attack. **[If NATO]{.underline}**, an organization
that has publicly returned to its original raison d'être of deterrence
and collective defence, **[becomes the entity that coordinates cyber
effects below the threshold of armed conflict, then the likelihood
increases that Russia misinterprets these effects as
escalatory]{.underline}** and acts accordingly. In other words, [a more
active NATO in the current strategic environment increases the risk that
the **existing intelligence norm will be undermined** and replaced by a
**more militarized norm**]{.underline}.

do and say [often establish **precedents** that strongly influence
**what other states do**]{.underline} and say -- [with potentially
**dramatic consequences for the shape of customary international law**.
The paradigmatic example is]{.underline} the establishment of [customary
international law on the continental shelf]{.underline} following the
Truman Proclamation of September 28, 1945,55 [which produced an echo of
similar claims and counterclaims, culminating in a whole new corpus of
the international law]{.underline} of the sea for what had previously
been understood only as a geological term of art.56

Many [states took note]{.underline}, for example, [when]{.underline} in
the 2002 National Security Strategy of [the United States]{.underline}
("NSS"), President Bush **[asserted]{.underline}** that the United
States had [**the right** under international law to engage in
preventive **wars of self-defense**]{.underline}.57 While, contrary to
popular belief, the United States never in fact formally relied on that
doctrine in practice, [many]{.underline} would [argue]{.underline} that
President [Bush de facto exercised this purported right when he
initiated an **armed conflict**]{.underline} with Iraq based on claims,
which have since proved unfounded, about its incipient programs to
develop catastrophic weapons. The 2006 NSS notably retreats from the
2002 NSS's robust claims of a right to engage in preventive wars of
self-defense.58 Yet [even within]{.underline} this [brief]{.underline},
four-year [period, an astonishing number of other states have asserted a
**comparable right to**]{.underline} engage in preventive
[**self-defense**. These include not only]{.underline} states that the
United States has described as "rogue states," such as [North Korea and
Iran, but]{.underline} Australia, [Japan]{.underline}, the United

### Impact\-\--International Law/AT: Realpolitik\-\--2NC

[The fact that international law is]{.underline} often [dismissed as
window-dressing on Realpolitik is **misleading**. Such an approach
**understates the importance of international agreements** in
maintaining **peace and security**. For liberal democracies that respect
the rule of law, **international law undoubtedly shapes and bounds
governments\' activities**]{.underline}. [At a time when]{.underline}
the action\'s of [unscrupulous states and violent extremist groups
continue to threaten peace and security internationally, it is **even
more important that such actions are countered with a strong commitment
to existing international law**]{.underline} and the values that it
represents.\'

#### International law solves [incentives for conflict]{.underline}\-\--realism ignores [background norms]{.underline}.

Timsit: [Your book's thesis that law]{.underline} alone has [stopped war
is controversial. What would you respond to realist critics]{.underline}
of your book, [who say it's really just power that matters?]{.underline}

Hathaway: **[Realists fail to understand how law works]{.underline}**.
... [When it is most effective, the law does not induce states to act
contrary to incentives; it **changes those incentives
themselves**]{.underline}. To take one example: [After war was outlawed,
conquest was no longer legal]{.underline}. As a result, [when Japan
invaded Manchuria in 1931, the U.S. and the states that were party to
the League of Nations **refused to recognize the
conquest**]{.underline}, pointing specifically to Japan's violation of
its legal obligations under the Pact, which Japan had ratified. [This
change in the rules thus **changed the incentives states
faced**]{.underline}---they could still seize land with force, but
**[they could no longer enjoy the fruits of their
conquests]{.underline}**.

The realist might respond that, even if the change in the law changes
behavior, that doesn't prove that law matters: The law is simply a tool
of the powerful---great nations create law that is in their interests,
and when the law changes behavior, power is doing the causal work, not
the law. But [to say that the powerful shape the law to reflect their
interests is not to say that law is merely a byproduct of
power]{.underline}. Power may lead to rules, but [rules take on lives of
their own. **They change behavior by changing the incentives for
action**]{.underline}---not just for the weak but for the strong as
well.

Scott Shapiro: So much of our book is an attempt to show that [the law
is playing such a strong role in the way states behave that we don't
even notice it. It's hiding in plain sight]{.underline}. So **[it's kind
of a triumph of the outlawry of war that we don't even recognize it at
work]{.underline}**. But, even though we're lawyers and think law is
really useful, we also think that the law has limits, that is, that
there's not always a legal answer to all the questions that arise. When
that happens, there are arbitral bodies \[such as\] the International
Court of Justice.

[UN is Both a Stage and an Actor]{.underline}

[The UN works best when its member states on the Security Council can
agree]{.underline} on an issue, and deploy the human, material and
military resources needed to address it. When the political will for
agreement is absent, and worse, [when]{.underline} the superpowers are
divided, [the UN cannot act]{.underline}.

[It is still a **useful forum** for states to **vent their opinions and
frustrations** on issues, as the debate on Ukraine
demonstrated]{.underline}. The US went ahead with its Security Council
resolution knowing full well that it would be vetoed, knowing that the
debate would reveal the principles and stake and show up Russia's
relative isolation in the world.

Indeed, though three states, including India, abstained, no one voted
alongside Russia against the resolution. **[The "demonstration effect"
served a purpose too.]{.underline}**

Let's not forget [**the UN is both a stage and an actor**. It is a stage
for its member states to declaim their differences and celebrate their
convergences]{.underline}; and it is an actor, in the shape of its
Secretary-General, its various agencies and its peace-keeping forces, to
execute what those member states agree upon.

[UN\'s Limitations Need to be Understood with an Open Mind]{.underline}

Some Secretaries-General are able to rise above the status of
"international civil servant" to command a moral presence on the world
stage. Dag Hammarskjold and Kofi Annan, both Nobel laureates, are
examples.

Annan was even described as a "secular Pope". When they spoke, the world
listened.

The current Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, a well-meaning former
Portuguese Prime Minister, resorted to the pulpit himself when he
appealed to Russia "in the name of humanity" to stop its invasion. But
the limits of moral suasion were apparent in the way his appeal went
unheeded, and without response.

At the height of the Cold War during the 1950s, Hammarskjold was asked
about the limitations of the organisation, and replied pithily: "[the
United Nations was not created to take mankind to heaven, but rather, to
**save humanity from hell**]{.underline}."

His point was clear: one should not seek perfection from an institution
of member states which would always be, more or less, the sum of its
parts. But **[an imperfect United Nations was better than none at
all.]{.underline}**

Let\'s Be Grateful for the UN We Have

The long-serving Soviet Ambassador to the UN in the 1960s, Yakov [Malik,
famously said that people dismissing the UN as an ineffective body
reminded him of an old story]{.underline} about Adam and Eve in the
Garden of Eden. Adam, he said, found that Eve was being indifferent to
him; so he asked her, "Eve, is there someone else?"

That's the point about the UN -- [is there anything else? It may be
helpless and hopeless sometimes, but it is the **only global platform
where every government in the world can come together to discuss issues
and policies**, raise global consciousness and when possible, **agree on
meaningful action**.]{.underline}

[If the United Nations did not exist, today's divided world would be
incapable of inventing it]{.underline}. Let's **[be grateful for the UN
we have. We'd be much worse off without it.]{.underline}**

[Another possible criticism is that **states often violate
norms**]{.underline} and specifically [that they have often violated the
norms against harming non-combatants]{.underline}. Hence, one might
argue that norms are effectively worthless. [However, in wars of
attrition, states have often **not violated the norm against targeting
civilians until late in the war**]{.underline}, and violate the norm out
of determination or even desperation to win \[40\]. [If the same logic
applied to cyber war, then a norm]{.underline} against
counter-infrastructure attacks [could contribute to
**delaying**]{.underline} these **[attacks and possibly]{.underline}**
thereby **[avoiding them]{.underline}**.

[We recognize that a **variety of other factors lend support to the US
preference for counterforce**]{.underline}, [including **military
organizational interests**]{.underline} in modernized and technically
advanced forces,25 **[the demands of maintaining morale
within]{.underline}** the **[nuclear commands]{.underline}**,26 [and
**worse-case planning**]{.underline} that understandably influences
nuclear strategy when the adversary's decision criteria and decision
calculus cannot be entirely known. [These factors are **sufficient on
their own to explain the US commitment to counterforce** and its pursuit
of damage limitation]{.underline}. Nevertheless, adding (or continuing
to develop and sharpen) another sophisticated, appealing, and easily
understood set of guidelines that favors counterforce risks widening the
internal coalition of government players who favor counterforce and
provides current proponents with a powerful argument. Our hope is that
the United States will eventually reject its counterforce doctrine
against major powers. **[Taking the LOAC off the table will not be
sufficient to bring about this radical change]{.underline}**. But
accepting the LOAC guidance for US nuclear strategy will make
accomplishing this transformation still more difficult.
