### 2AC----Ruse of Analogy

#### The Settler/Native/Slave triad relegates the position of the slave into an [empty signifier]{.underline} to be filled by any track towards liberation------blackness is [resistant]{.underline} to projects of recovery

Slavery [The positivist affirmation of land is not methodologically
innocent. Its implications can best be understood in how it indents the
political ontology of slavery and the methods of Black studies. As we
have noted, by framing the "settler-native-slave" triad through the
presumptive totality of settler colonialism, Tuck and Yang bring the
slave into the fold only to disavow its premises.]{.underline}12
[Slavery can be a component of settler colonialism, but when consigned
to the "labor theory of slavery", the constituent elements of the slave
position (and the possibility that slavery might be in excess to the
demand for labour) can never be broached.]{.underline} Further, [the
Indigenous quilting point---**land**---**enables a chain of meaningful
struggle and recovery unavailable to the enslaved**. Indigenous peoples
have protection against the threat of their struggle being "turned into
an empty signifier to be filled by any track towards
liberation"]{.underline} (Tuck and Yang 2012:7) [through access to the
physical object of land which, even if understood relationally and
through remembrance, can only be returned in its total physical
presence.]{.underline} Tuck and Yang's analysis and citational practices
demonstrate that [**while land rescues Indigenous peoples from the
condition of interminable metaphoricity** (the driving thesis of their
essay), **Black people are in the singular position of beginning and
ending their "track towards Liberation" as empty
signifiers**.]{.underline} Land is the signifier that secures the
impossibility of Indigenous fungibility.¶ Take the telling seventh
footnote, in which Tuck and Yang clarify the structural logics of their
triad---a footnote worth quoting in full because, if brought into the
body of the text, it would wreak havoc on its premises: \... [although
the setter-native-slave triad structures settler colonialism, this does
not mean that settler, native, and slave are analogs that can be used to
describe corresponding identities, structural locations, worldviews, and
behaviors. Nor do they mutually constitute one another.]{.underline} For
example, [Indigenous is an identity independent of the triad, and also
an ascribed structural location within the triad. Chattel slave is an
ascribed structural position, but not an identity]{.underline}. Settler
describes a set of behaviors, as well as a structural location, but is
eschewed as an identity. (Tuck and Yang 2012:7n7)13¶ Whereas the native,
we are told, can claim both "an identity independent of the triad" and
"an ascribed structural location within the triad", the slave is
positioned through "an ascribed structural position, but not an
identity". [It is the native's independent identity, always stabilised
by the relationship with land, that can stop what would otherwise be a
runaway chain of signification. **It is clear that by this
differentiation Tuck and Yang want to preempt falling prey to
Wilderson's (2010) "ruse of analogy".**]{.underline} 14 As we will see,
Tuck and Yang (2012:17) mobilise a similar refrain, "colonial
equivocation", to guard against coalitional appropriations of
colonialism. [What their metaphysical commitment to positivism misses,
however, is the doubled valence of the ruse. **Slavery is resistant to
the project of recovery---there is no hidden material, neither land nor
identity, to be recovered.** The slave's lack of identity, as postulated
by Tuck and Yang, also doubles to expose a lack in their theorisation of
slavery because of the problem at the constitutive core of slavery: not
the presence of land, appropriated identity, or alienated labour, but,
as we will argue, the lack of anything to lack.]{.underline} Their
method cannot accede this aporetic possibility.¶ "Decolonization is Not
a Metaphor" instead intensifies the difference formulated by Wolfe
between (1) Blackness as "expansive", "inherited" through the one-drop
rule "by an expanding number of 'black' descendants"; and (2) Indigenous
peoples "racialized" as "subtractive": "Native Americans are constructed
to become fewer in number and less Native, but never exactly white, over
time" (Tuck and Yang 2012:12; see also Wolfe 2006:387).15 This
subtractive logic is propelled, not surprisingly, by the priority of
land: "Native American is a racialisation that portrays contemporary
Indigenous generations to be less authentic, less Indigenous than every
prior generation in order to ultimately phase out Indigenous claims to
land and usher in settler claims to property" (Tuck and Yang 2012:12).
What might animate the anti-Black logics of the one-drop rule dissolves
except in a synthetic analysis that would collapse both "the
racializations of Indigenous people and Black people in the US settler
colonial nation-state" as "geared to ensure the ascendancy of white
settlers as the true and rightful owners and occupiers of the land"
(Tuck and Yang 2012:12), which is to say both Indigenous and Black
peoples are structured by a common settler-colonial project, even as
Black people (insofar as "the US government promised 40 acres of Indian
land as reparations for plantation slavery" \[Tuck and Yang 2012:29\])
are also figured as proto-settlers.16 The grounding "settler" concept
frays further when considering that (1) the "Indian Removal Act" also
rendered native peoples unwilling settlers by relocating them to already
Indigenous populated territories (Smithers 2015:117--128); (2)
[**Indigenous peoples remain Indigenous when they move or are forcibly
moved**, because **indigeneity expresses relationality, not
possession**]{.underline} (Blackwell et al. 2017:127; Radcliffe 2017);
(3) in Latin America, creolisation has, complexly, been referred to as
an "indigenizing process" (Castellanos 2017:777; Jackson 2012:42--44);
and (4) [**African indigeneity meant a unique intensification of
structures of slavery** on the African continent through settler
colonialism]{.underline} (Kelley 2017).17 The last two points also serve
to underscore the Anglo-centrism of Tuck and Yang's argument, as Canada
and the United States remain their point of departure for understanding
of the relation between Blackness and Indigeneity, rather than the
Western hemisphere as a whole.¶ Consider too how the asymmetry between
native and slave operates within Tuck and Yang's discussion of "playing
Indian" (Tuck and Yang 2012:8--9), which in Tuck et al. (2014b:16) means
not only tribal garb but also those "alternative" settler cultures of
"communalism and counterculturalism, such as in rural communes,
permaculture, squatting, hoboing, foraging, and neo-pagan, earth-based,
and New Age spirituality \... formed by occupying and traversing stolen
Indigenous land and often by practicing cultural and spiritual
appropriation". 18 "Playing Indian" involves putting on the
accoutrements of Indianness in much the same way that Blackness is
performatively appropriated---the difference is that the decolonization
metaphor is never theorised as central to the struggle over land. In
"Decolonization is Not a Metaphor", the impulse to "go native" is
instead nonessential to the subject-formation of the native. It is a
late, superstructural practice meant to relieve settler anxiety, to
provide "some mercy or relief in face of the relentlessness of settler
guilt and haunting" (Tuck and Yang 2012:9), but whose embrace of a
kumbaya sensibility, while advocating a "reinhabitation" of the
environment on ethical grounds, actually tends towards the replacement
of Indigeneity.19 "\[J\]ust as relentless as the desire to disappear the
Native", playing Indian ("the desire to become without becoming
\[Indian\]" \[Tuck and Yang 2012:14\]) "is a desire to not have to deal
with this (Indian) problem anymore" (Tuck and Yang 2012:9). As the
performative expression of the metaphorical conceit, playing Indian is a
secondary (not constitutive) strategy en route to extermination.20 It
drives towards "moves to innocence", from the invention of long-lost
ancestors (Elizabeth Warren comes to mind)21 to settler adoption
fantasies (Dances with Wolves and The Last of the Mohicans \[Tuck and
Yang 2012:13--17\]) to the "colonial equivocation" of coalitions that
proclaim "We are all colonized" (behind which is the implication "None
of us are settlers" \[Tuck and Yang 2012:17\]).¶ [Unlike the late
origins of the decolonization metaphor, we argue that the slave metaphor
is central to the structuring logics of slavery, not an after-effect.
**While Tuck and Yang see "colonial equivocation" as an erasure of what
is distinct about settler colonialism (land), Wilderson's "ruse of
analogy" registers the distinction of racial slavery as the absence of
anything to claim.**]{.underline} This means that, as "a crucial and
fungible conceptual possession of civil society" (Wilderson 2010:21),
slavery is only ever available as semantic displacement.
[Slavery-as-metaphor is the beingof-slavery, what Wilderson (2010) calls
its "political ontology".]{.underline} Tuck and Yang's mis-reading of
this ruse is replicated in J. Kehaulani Kauanui's (2017) critique of
Afro-pessimism. For Kauanui, the political-ontological approach, which
would make Blackness-as-slaveness immanent and essential to a violent
political determination of being (rather than exogenous and contingent),
is a symptom of what it means to critique: "to assert blackness as
ontological is to recapitulate colonising thought, to take colonial
ideology as truth" (2017:258).22 In order to extract Blackness from its
colonial-ontological confines, Kauanui proposes a turn to the historical
and concrete. By identifying the contingency of racial slavery as
"rooted in historicizing race" (2017:259), Kauanui searches for a
non-ontological Blackness. She finds it in a twist to the (by now much
disputed) origin story ascribed to late 17th century Virginia and
Bacon's Rebellion, [**arguing that slaves and indentured servants were**
not only equally (and economically) oppressed but also **united in
"efforts to commit genocide against indigenous peoples**"]{.underline}
(Kauanui 2017:261).23 This reading **[renders race an "additional
pliant"]{.underline}** (Kauanui 2017:260) [**to** the **conquest** of
native lands, which is to say that slavery is internal to settler
colonialism.]{.underline} ¶ [We offer an alternative structural history,
one that neither cedes to the pressures of empiricism as grounds for
critique nor falls prey to the obfuscation of metaphor that Tuck and
Yang charge non-land-based struggle with. **By centralising political
ontology** precisely as the problem of the relationship between history
and contingency, materiality and the symbolic, **we attempt to** account
for the genesis and structure of modernity, and **propose slavery as the
code that functions as "the a priori or ground of the history to which
it gives rise"**]{.underline} (Scott and Wynter 2000:197; see also
Warren 2018). For Tuck and Yang, the "current colonial era goes back to
1492, when colonial imaginary goes global" (2012:4n2). For Sylvia Wynter
(1995, 2003), by contrast, the basis of the triadic political ontology
of the post-1492 Americas was well established prior to the Columbian
expedition (see also King 2019:15--21).24 Black slaves---as they crossed
from the "old world" sugar-complex to the new world---would play a
central role in the formulation of what we recognise as the modern
world. If slavery is essential to the grounding logics of capitalism, it
also needs to be situated in the political-economic geography of the
Mediterranean within which the conquest of the New World was conceived.
[**The Columbian expedition would not have been possible without the
inauguration of slavery** earlier in the 15th century, as "the
Portuguese landing on the shores of today's Senegal and their drawing of
areas of West Africa into a mercantile network and trading
system"]{.underline} (Wynter 1995:10) [challenged the geographical and
technological orthodoxy of late medieval scholasticism, and solidified
the political-economic relations that would blossom into global civil
society.]{.underline} [**The position of the slave was both materially
and symbolically significant, for the reification of Africans as the
only "legitimately enslaveable population" enabled the emerging
discourses of republicanism and civic humanism**, and thereby sutured
the "moral and philosophical foundations of post-1492
polities"]{.underline} (Wynter 1995:35; see also Wynter 2003:309).
Likewise, McKittrick argues that the "'naturalization' of difference"
was "bolstered by the ideological weight of transparent space, the idea
that space 'just is'" (McKittrick 2006:xv). The political-symbolic
structures of slavery are essential to the production of space and its
meanings. By condensing this lattice into "forced labor" in extremis,
Tuck and Yang miss how [the conceptual density of slavery might always
already condition the positivism of land. **Slavery cannot be added as
an afterthought without diminishing the historical-geographical scope of
modernity and leaving the constitution of the material and symbolic
conditions of conquest unthought**]{.underline}.¶ With the "labor theory
of slavery", slavery has been drawn into the whirlpool of Marxist
critique (e.g. Beckert and Rockman 2016; Tomich 2004). And while Marxism
certainly has methodological and political purchase, we argue that the
now perennial and unsolved problem of how race connects to class (and
slavery to capitalism) points to the need to call upon and develop new
frameworks of approach (Bledsoe and Wright 2019; Sorentino 2019;
Wilderson 2010). Drawing from a tradition of theorising interested in
the non-economic utility of the slave (Sexton 2010, 2014; Spillers
2003a; Wilderson 2010; Wynter 1995, 2003), we are interested in what
becomes available for critique when identifying the constitution of
slavery through its "metaphorical aptitude", the way the slave operates
as "the imaginative surface upon which the master and the nation came to
understand themselves" (Hartman 1997:7). Focus on formlessness or, as
Hartman calls it, the "figurative capacities of blackness" (1997:7)
complicates critiques of colonial sovereignty, property, and land
acquisition. The metaphoricity of the slave is a feature of the global
fungibility of the slave---its interchangeability and replaceability.
Fungibility renders the slave a vessel through which the settler-master
regenerates their position: "The dispossessed body of the enslaved is
the surrogate for the master's body since it guarantees his disembodied
universality and acts as the sign of his power and dominion" (Hartman
1997:21). Hartman's reading of fungibility provides a possible reading
of the constitution of settler's capacity to undertake the
settler-colonial project in ways that don't simply take for granted
Lockean conceptions of history and property. King does precisely that,
identifying how the slave's role in signifying "expansion and spatial
possibility became a feature of the spatial imagination of the
conquistador-settler" (2019:120). [Taken further, as "an open sign that
can be arranged and rearranged for infinite kinds of use"]{.underline}
(King 2019:104), [**the slave enables the very possibility for the
settler to accumulate land and wealth.** Blackness is rendered
"a-spatial"]{.underline} (Bledsoe and Wright 2019:12--13) [and
"unsovereign"]{.underline} (Sexton 2014:11) [such that slavery provides
the "enabling postulates" for the "social and discursive practices" of
the post-1492 world]{.underline} (Spillers 2003a:18; Walcott 2014). ¶

[[AFRICOM is]{.mark} actually [a]{.mark} [direct]{.mark}
[product]{.mark} [of NATO via EUCOM]{.mark}]{.underline}, the U.S.
European command[. [EUCOM is a central part of NATO
and]{.underline}]{.mark} [originally also [took responsibility for 42
African states]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2004 NATO ended a five-year
period of expansion; in 2007 the EUCOM commander proposed the creation
of AFRICOM. James L. Jones Jr. explains how he came to make the proposal
for AFRICOM from his position as commander of EUCOM as well as commander
of operational forces of NATO. [[The U.S./NATO role in the destruction
of Libya]{.mark} in 2011]{.underline} is important to highlight because
it [[offers]{.mark} [some important lessons. First, U.S.
imperialism]{.mark} and its western lackies [do not accept any
country]{.mark} [that decides to be]{.mark} an [independent]{.mark}
force outside of its sphere of influence.]{.underline}
[Secondly]{.underline}, [it also demonstrates how NATO can work hand in
hand with other U.S./western dominated world structures like the
UN]{.underline}. [In 2011]{.underline} the [UN]{.underline} (resolution
1973) [gave political authorization for a "no fly zone" and blockade of
Libya purportedly to "protect" its citizens but which ultimately
resulted in the destruction of Africa's most prosperous
country]{.underline} with the highest Human Development Index. [[U.S.
led NATO forces launched a bombing campaign that killed thousands of
civilians and caused]{.mark} tens of billions of property and
[infrastructure]{.mark} [damage]{.mark}.]{.underline} This shows that
although [[U.S.-led NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes uses the UN for
political cover, [it [has no problem illegally overstepping]{.mark} its
UN mandate [to commit its crimes against humanity and achieve its regime
change goal]{.mark}s]{.underline}. Even a few countries that abstained
from the UN vote like China said they did so as not to offend the
reactionary Arab League and the African Union which approved of the
resolution. In this case indirect and direct cooperation between NATO,
the UN, the AU, and the Arab League (which includes the GCC countries)
shows the expansive and deeply woven web of U.S. and NATO reach. The
book The Illegal War on Libya edited by Cynthia McKinney, includes the
chapter titled "NATO's Libya War, A Nuremberg Level Crime" in which
Stephen Ledman writes: "The U.S.-led NATO war on Libya will be
remembered as one of history's greatest crimes, violating the letter and
spirit of international law and America's Constitution. The Nuremberg
Tribunal's Chief Justice Robert Jackson (a Supreme Court justice) called
Nazi war crimes 'the supreme international crime against peace.' Here
are his November 21, 1945 opening remarks: The wrongs which we seek to
condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so
devastating, that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored,
because it cannot survive their being repeated. Jackson called
aggressive war "the greatest menace of our times[." [International law
defines crimes against peace as]{.underline}]{.mark} "planning,
preparation, initiation, or [waging of [wars of
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}, or a war in violation of international
treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or
conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing[." [All U.S.
post-WWII wars fall under this definition]{.mark}. [Since then,
America]{.mark} \[U.S[.\] has waged]{.mark} direct and proxy
premeditated, aggressive [wars worldwide]{.mark}. It has killed millions
in East and Central Asia, North and other parts of Africa, the Middle
East, and Europe, as well as in Central and South America]{.underline}.8
[[Those]{.mark} mentioned here [are but a small sampling of
NATO]{.mark}/AFRICOM['s]{.mark} [bloody works in Africa's past]{.mark}.
[NATO]{.mark} continues to [operate]{.mark} [under]{.mark} guise the of
"training" and "[humanitarian]{.mark}" [peacekeeping]{.mark}
assistance]{.underline}. Jihadist [[terrorist]{.mark} [violence]{.mark}
on the continent [has]{.mark} [increased]{.mark} [since]{.mark} the
founding of [AFRICOM]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [NATO's]{.mark}
[destruction]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [Libya]{.mark} resulting in civilian
casualties and instability [which the west has used a]{.mark}s pretext
and [justification for]{.mark} the continued need for
[AFRICOM]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As the Black Alliance for Peace's
AFRICOM watch bulletin reported, since the founding of AFRICOM there has
also been an increase in coups by AFRICOM trained soldiers]{.underline}.
Consistent with what Nkrumah, Rodney and others warned of in the 1960's
and 1970's [[NATO continues today in the form of AFRICOM facilitating
wars]{.mark}, instability, [and]{.mark} the corporate [pillage of
Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} Democratic Republic of
Congo ([DRC]{.underline}) for example [is [continuously plundered
for]{.mark} its strategic [raw materials]{.mark}]{.underline} such as
cobalt, tantalum, chromium, coltan, and uranium etc[. [These minerals
are]{.underline}]{.mark} [strategically [important]{.mark}]{.underline}
not only for electronic devices but also [[for]{.mark} the [technologies
that drive the military industrial complex]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[AFRICOM continues to rely on its neocolonial African proxies to fight
wars on its behalf in the DRC and throughout Africa to achieve its
objectives.]{.underline} With the rise of China, the U.S./NATO now seek
to ensure full spectrum dominance that seeks to shut China or any other
country out of the competition to control global capital.

The difference between Afropessimism and the major revolutionary
theories of modernity are as glaring as the similarities. [True
Afropessimism is not animated by reformist desire to end discriminatory
practices in the world; it is animated by an understanding that world
itself is unethical and needs be undone]{.underline}. Also, [it is a
theory, like Marxism, radical feminism, postcolonial studies, and
radical lgbt theory, which argues that violence is necessary to form an
unethical paradigm (to create world) and, ultimately, violence is
necessary to undo an unethical paradigm (to bring about the end of the
world)]{.underline}. Again, [Afropessimism parts company with these
theories, however, in that it does not offer an alternative
worldview.]{.underline} The reasons for this refusal of the prescriptive
gesture are complex, but, to state it simply, [Afropessimists
argue]{.underline} that whereas [the paradigmatic antagonism
that]{.underline} the [aforementioned theories posit as being central to
the formation of world are all subject positions of one kind or another,
in other words, all various categories within the same species, that
species being the Human (woman/man, worker/boss, native/settler,
queer/straight are, in various paradigms, antagonists, to be sure, but
they are also all Human beings)]{.underline}, [the Black or Slave is not
a category of Human.]{.underline} We have here a critique that is far
more comprehensive and whose implications are more far reaching than the
implications of its theoretical counterparts. [The antagonist of the
woman is the man; the antagonist of the worker is the boss; the
antagonist of the queer is the straight---but the antagonist of the
Black is the Human]{.underline}. [If revolutionary feminism is an
immanent critique of the family or the paradigm of kinship, if Marxism
is an immanent critique of capitalism or the paradigm of political
economy as a structure, then Afropessimism is an immanent critique of
the Human or the paradigm of Humanity]{.underline}.1 This is why
[Afropessimists]{.underline} are [loath]{.underline} to offer what in
revolutionary circles are called ["alternative visions]{.underline}."
Whereas [it is possible to imagine an alternative filial world (a
kinship void of patriarchy) and it is possible to imagine an alternative
economic world (an economy void of capitalism), it is epistemologically
impossible to imagine an alternative Human world (a world void of
relationality)]{.underline}. Heretofore, [revolutionary theory has
concerned itself with unethical modes of relation]{.underline}: [gender
and economic, for example]{.underline}. These theories have performed
immanent critiques in order to show how and why the way relations are
organized and empowered (or disempowered) within a (filial or economic)
paradigm are unethical. By contrast, Afropessimists argue that these
immanent critiques do not go far enough; [that if one were to deploy
Blackness]{.underline} (or Slaveness) [as one's lens of
interpretation]{.underline}, [one would be able to critique not just the
way relations are organized and empowered and find those modes of
organization and empowerment to be unethical; but one would be armed
with a theoretical apparatus that would allow one to perform an immanent
critique of relationality itself. Looked]{.underline} at [through the
lens of Blackness,]{.underline} [one would be able to see how
relationality itself]{.underline} (all relations of any kind) is
unethical because relationality, the capacity to be, [is predicated on
antiblackness]{.underline}. To be is to be other than Black. "Simple
enough one has only not to be a nigger" (Fanon 1967a, 115). What Fanon
alerts us to is another key Afropessimist tenet: that [there is no
analogy between the suffering of Black people and those others who find
themselves subjugated by unethical paradigms (such as patriarchy and
capitalism).]{.underline} [Analogy is a ruse]{.underline}, in part
[because]{.underline}, [once the subjects of unethical paradigms are
liberated from their chains, they will still stand in contradistinction
to the Slave]{.underline}. [They will still be Human. Ergo, they will
still be the Black's antagonists]{.underline}. Afropessimism connects
the work of scholars such as Saidiya Hartman, Jared Sexton, Hortense
Spillers, David Marriott, Frank B. Wilderson III, and others, and builds
on its own unique reading of the seminal works of Frantz Fanon, Orlando
Patterson, and Sylvia Wynter. The vital and decisive move made by these
writers is one that takes the Black out of the Human; or, more
accurately, Afropessimism demonstrates how a Human is always already not
a Black. Blackness, Afropessimists argue, is what makes the Human
conceptually coherent because, if the positive attributes of what it
means to be Human are ever in doubt, the meaning can be secured by a
reflection upon what it is not: [to be Human, one has simply not to be
Black (just as capitalist stands in ontological contradistinction to
worker and as man stands in ontological distinction to
woman]{.underline}). In other words, Afropessimism argues that we cannot
take the word "Human" at face value. Like any other word or concept,
"Human" does not come with its meaning neatly tied in a bow. [The Human
is a construct]{.underline}. To know the Human is to know, first and
foremost, what it is not. [Humans are sentient beings who are not
Black]{.underline}. Blacks are sentient beings who are not Human. [There
is a structural]{.underline} (which is to say, necessary) [antagonism
between Blacks and Humans; and this antagonism hinges on
violence]{.underline}. [The paradigm of violence that positions and
oppresses degraded forms of Humanity, such as colored immigrants, women
(who are not Black), lgbt people, Indigenous people, and working-class
folks (who are not Black), cannot be analogized with the paradigm of
violence that positions and oppresses Blackness]{.underline}. [Any
analogy between the grammar of suffering of degraded Humans and the
grammar of suffering of Blacks is hobbled by the ruse of
analogy]{.underline}. [Degraded forms of Humans are positioned and
oppressed by a grammar of suffering known as exploitation and
alienation. But Black people are positioned and oppressed by a grammar
of suffering known as "fungibility and accumulation"]{.underline}
(Hartman 1997). [Blacks are objects and implements to be]{.underline}
possessed ([accumulated]{.underline}) [and]{.underline} exchanged ([made
fungible]{.underline}) [in the material and psychic life of Human
subjects]{.underline}. Black people are the things that belong to
Humans. In this way, all Humans are Masters in their relation to Blacks;
and all Blacks are Slaves in their relation to Humans---and this
paradigmatic arrangement holds true, [Afropessimists argue, whether we
are speaking about exalted Human formations, such as heterosexual White
males, or degraded Human formations, such as the lgbt community or Brown
immigrants or the working class. Afropessimists interrogate the historic
development of the Human, and what that development has meant for the
creation of the Black as nonHuman. Blackness is an ontological position;
that is, as a grammar of suffering, the Slave is not a laborer but an
anti-Human, a positionality against which Humanity establishes,
maintains, and renews its coherence, its corporeal
integrity]{.underline}. In this way, [the socially dead or fungible
Slave is a necessary foil for the construction of the socially alive
Human.]{.underline} [This relationship is]{.underline} both
fundamentally [destructive and necessary for the construction of
liberated Human subjects]{.underline}. For example, [the circulation of
Blackness as metaphor and image within progressive multiracial (meaning,
decidedly nonblack) movements produces dreams of liberation which are,
as we will see, parasitic on the suffering of Blacks without, in any
essential way, contributing to the liberation of Black
suffering.]{.underline} As Black people, we often mistake this as being
the highest form of empathy and recognition. In point of fact, to
paraphrase Hartman, it's just an extension of the master's prerogative.
We facilitate the imagination of people and worlds in which we play no
part. [Afropessimism]{.underline} is not a politics, but it does [point
to the need for a new]{.underline} kind of politics that resonates with
Fanon's call for the "end of the world": a complete [revolution of what
currently exists]{.underline}. [And this undoing is aimed at exalted
Humanity (White men), as well as degraded Humanity (oppressed people of
color).]{.underline} [Afropessimism is not a politics, in part, because
the politics that arise from modernity's treatises of Human liberation
(e.g., Marxism, feminism, postcolonialism, Indigenism) are all
constructed by two scaffolds]{.underline}---[one of which is
conspicuously absent from Afropessimism]{.underline}. [Those two
scaffolds are description and prescription]{.underline}.
[Marx]{.underline}, for example, [describes the world as being out of
joint]{.underline}, [as being unethical]{.underline} in its essential
arrangements [because of the distribution of capacities in political
economy: capitalists are the only ones with the capacity to accumulate
surplus value]{.underline}. This mode of accumulation is parasitic on
the labor power of the working class. [Therein lies the descriptive
scaffold,]{.underline} and it is thoroughly explicated in over three
thousand pages in Marx's (1976) Das Kapital. [To put it simply, the
world is unethical and out of joint due to a structural antagonism
between the haves and the have-nots]{.underline}. [The prescriptive
scaffold is Marx's answer to the question, What is to be done? Here
Marxism is unwavering in its answer: destroy capitalist capacity, bring
about the end of the capitalist political economy, and usher in a
communist political economy, by any means necessary.]{.underline} [The
prescriptive scaffold can be summed up in a
word---communism]{.underline}; or in a phrase---the dictatorship of the
proletariat. [His prescription offers]{.underline} not just the promise
of redress and renewal in some abstract, ideal, or spiritual sense, but
[a concrete proposal as to how the working class will be
liberated]{.underline} and what liberation will look like on the other
side of capitalism. [No such concept or proposal is offered by
Afropessimism]{.underline}, for who can say what liberation looks like
on the other side of Humanity? [Instead of interrogating the capitalist
and the capacity of her or his position, Afropessimism interrogates the
Human and its capacity as being parasitic on the absence of the Slave's,
or Black's, capacity (the absence of agency)]{.underline}. [Therein lies
the descriptive scaffold of Afropessimism]{.underline}, and it is
explicated by the scholars cited above, as well as in countless articles
and an archive of monographs that are being written and published. [The
Human has three constituent elements: natality, honor, and contingent
violence. These constituent elements of Human subjectivity are not
embodied by the Slave or Black, and their conceptual coherence is
vouchsafed in contradistinction to the Slave's or Black's lack of
them]{.underline}. (Just as the cap- A fropessimism and the R use of
Analogy 43 italist has the capacity to accumulate surplus value, and
this capacity is necessarily lacking in the worker; but the absence of
this capacity in the worker is required to give its presence coherence
in the capitalist.) [The social death of the Slave, or Black, has three
constituent elements: natal alienation, general dishonor, and naked or
gratuitous violence]{.underline} (Patterson 1982). [Gratuitous violence
secures natal alienation and general dishonor.]{.underline} [The Black
body]{.underline}, [or Black "flesh,"]{.underline} as Spillers (2003)
would say, [is a sentient being for which no form of violence is
psychically beyond the limit. In other words, there is nothing one can
do to this body, in the collective unconscious or the libidinal economy,
that would be deemed "violence beyond the limit"]{.underline} (Eltis
1993).

### 2AC----SAMEER FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE STOP

**Wolves lead to far-right populism.**

**Ferreira 22 (**Becky Ferreira; Science writer based in Ithaca, NY.
Contributing editor VICE and motherboard. Bylines in NYTScience,
washingtonpost, WIRED & more. "Scientists Find Link Between Wolf Attacks
and Far Right Politics"; Published JULY 19 2022) Dōgen

[Wolves hold a special place in the human imagination that dates into
prehistory, and has surfaced countless times in folklore and
culture]{.underline}. Now, [scientists have presented a modern iteration
of this ancient obsession in a new study that links the reintroduction
of wolves into Germany with a rise in electoral support for far-right
politicians.]{.underline} Wolves once occupied an enormous range across
much of North America and Eurasia, but human activities such as
over-hunting and habitat destruction caused their numbers to crash in
recent centuries. Numerous nations, including the United States and
Germany, have spent years reintroducing wolves to regions where they
previously were exterminated, which has positive ripple effects on
ecosystems but has also resulted in wolves preying on livestock. Now,
research led by Bernhard Clemm von Hohenberg, a computational social
scientist at the University of Amsterdam, combines a range of different
data about public opinion on wolves that includes fine-grained spatial
maps of wolf attacks in German municipalities, local surveys, Twitter
posts, election manifestos, and Facebook ads. Together, [the results
provide "evidence that the reemergence of the wolf has been accompanied
by electoral gains for far-right parties"]{.underline} and show that
"far-right politicians frame the wolf as a threat to economic
livelihoods," [according to a study published on Monday in Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences]{.underline} that focused, in
particular, on the German far-right party Alternative für Deutschland
(AfD). ["To fight global warming and biodiversity loss, governments
around the globe are implementing far-reaching conservation programs
including the restoration of habitats and large-scale reforestation,"
said von Hohenberg and co-author Anselm Hager, an assistant professor of
international politics at Humboldt University of Berlin, in the study,
adding that the effects of these actions can "generate political
backlash."]{.underline} "Although the complexities of human--wildlife
conflicts are increasingly recognized, evidence on the political
repercussions is still scarce," the pair continued. "The growing success
of radical far-right parties across Europe, which have an ambivalent or
outright negative stance toward conservation, makes this a particularly
pressing issue." To tease out the potential connection between wolves
and far-right electoral fortunes, von Hohenberg and Hager analyzed
voting behavior in communities with and without wolf attacks across
time. The researchers introduced controls for "a host of variables that
may confound the relationship between wolf attacks," including attitudes
toward immigration and employment, but they still cautioned against
"interpreting the findings in a causal manner," according to the study.
Social scientists, political scientists, social media companies,
academics, and Twitter knowers have all tried to come up with
explanations for a terrifyingly resurgent far right; "wolves" are surely
not to blame for what is ultimately a highly complex failing of modern
society. The correlation, however, is notable and interesting
considering the controls implemented by Hochenberg and Hager. The
results revealed that the AfD gained between 1 and 2 percentage points
in federal elections, and as much as 5 percentage points in state
elections, after a wolf attack in a given municipality. These point
fluctuations correspond to absolute vote shares of 9.2 percent on
average federally and 11.6 percent on average on the state level since
2013. In addition, the team pulled data from more than 3.5 million
tweets made by German members of parliaments since 2008 and what they
call "the entire universe" of AfD Facebook ads posted over the past four
years, totalling 10,475 unique ads. The ads corroborated links between
antiwolf sentiment and far right politics; one message read, "The wolf
is a predator, which leads to livestock loss among farmers," according
to the team's translation. Livestock predation by wolves is a very real
problem for farmers that can involve economical losses and psychological
distress, among other negative consequences. However, von Hohenberg and
Hager note that this specific issue could imperil broader attempts to
mitigate climate change and recover biodiversity in wolf territories.
It's a problem that needs to be wrestled with because this link between
right wing politics and antiwolf positions has shown up in other
nations, including the United States. "Experiencing wolves killing
livestock in one's vicinity increases the likelihood of voting for
far-right, conservation-skeptical parties," the team said in the study.
"Since these parties often oppose measures against climate change, this
may lead to a perplexing backlash effect of policies intended to help
the environment." ["Given that many more wolf packs are expected to find
territories in Europe---models estimate an increase to up to 1,400 packs
in Germany from 150 today---mitigating wolf predation on livestock as
effectively as possible and generally finding balanced coexistence
policies are key to future conservation and climate protection efforts,"
the researchers concluded.]{.underline}

### Limits Bad

#### Their LIMITS are constrained within an anti-black logic that makes their model of education unethical -- vote aff as a form of meaning-making that exceeds their grammars of suffering

**Warren**, Assistant Professor of American Studies, **2015** (Calvin,
research fellow at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in Africology,
\"Black Nihilism and the Politics of Hope\", CR: The New Centennial
Review, 15.1)

Within critical discourses, black nihilism is saturated with negative
semantics. Theorists consider it the bane of black existence and
appropriate language and metaphors of the pathological to situate black
nihilism outside of Ethics and moral law. Many describe it as a "disease
of the soul" that produces callousness, meaninglessness, and masochism.
Thus, the rhetorical maneuvers performed in this work attempt to
foreclose a critical engagement with the term itself---to deprive the
term of intellectual nourishment and precipitate its demise. I want to
rescue the term from this discursive annihilation and offer it up as the
most significant philosophical perspective in the twenty-first century.
This is certainly an audacious claim, but [any critical analysis of
black existence in the twenty-first century will have to contend with
black nihilism---either reluctantly or otherwise. It is the inescapable
interlocutor in every utterance about blackness; it demands an address.
**[One cannot simply disregard the black nihilistic position as]{.mark}
insane, naive, or [irrational anymore]{.mark}**]{.underline}---although
these rhetorical maneuvers were successful in previous generations.
[**[The surd of anti-blackness requires a position outside the liberal
grammar of bio-politics, futurity, and "hope" to limn the depth of black
suffering]{.mark}**. [Black nihilism expresses discursively what black
bodies endure existentially in an anti-black world]{.mark}]{.underline}
(the "bio-political grotesque"). [The project of rescuing]{.underline}
(or resuscitating) [this term, which is the objective of this essay, is
absolutely essential to understanding the "lived experience of the
black,]{.underline}" as Fanon would have it. Frederick Nietzsche is
credited with the term "Nihilism" and describes it as a particular
crisis of modernity. The universal narratives and grounds of
legitimation that once secured meaning for the modern world had lost
integrity. In the absence of a metaphysical grounding of social
existence, we were left with a void---a void that dispenses with
metaphysical substance, even as this substance unsuccessfully attempts
to refill this void. Nihilism, then, presents itself as the
philosophical reflection of social decay; it offers
politico-philosophical death (the death of ground) as the only "hope"
for the world. Theorists often strip black nihilism of this
philosophical significance and this, in my view, is a fatal error. When
denuded of philosophical functionality, black nihilism becomes nothing
more than a catalog of "dysfunctional" behaviors. Behavior and
philosophy are unmoored in this understanding of black nihilism, as if
one is not the articulation of the other---they, indeed,
"inter-articulate" each other. We might even suggest that [the
purported, dysfunctional behavior of the black nihilist is discourse by
other means, when traditional avenues of articulation and redress are
inadequate and inaccessible]{.underline}. Cornel West introduces [black
nihilism as a term]{.underline} to describe a crisis in black
communities in Race Matters (1994). For him, nihilism [is]{.underline}
to be understood here not as a philosophic doctrine that there are no
rational grounds for legitimate standards or authority; it is, far more,
[the lived experience of coping with a life of horrifying meaningless,
hopelessness, and]{.underline} (most important)
[lovelessness]{.underline}. The frightening result is a numbing
detachment from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the
world. Life without meaning, hope, and love breeds a coldhearted,
mean-spirited outlook that destroys both the individual and others. (23)
[It is an existential angst that resembles "a kind of collective
clinical depression" and a disease that resembles alcoholism and drug
addiction]{.underline} (29). [It "can never be completely cured, and
there is always the possibility of relapse"]{.underline} (29). According
to West, [**[lovelessness, hopelessness, and meaninglessness are results
of market forces and market moralities attenuating black institutions,
weakening the armor that once provided protection against the
pulverizing force of anti-blackness. Black nihilism indexes a
devastating exposure to institutional, spiritual, and psychic violence
against blacks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Within this description of
nihilism, however, there is a certain tension between grounding and
ungrounding. [Black institutions assert themselves as necessary ground
but are unable to secure this position, which leaves a void that
capitalistic market forces are filling. This shifting of ground is a
symptom of the metaphysical organization of life. The problem, then, is
grounding itself. [How do black institutions establish themselves as
ground and by what process does this ground shift]{.mark}? **It is
precisely [the establishment and shifting of ground]{.mark} that [is the
"meaninglessness" of which black nihilism rejects---it has no legitimacy
other than its "own will to power."]{.mark}** [If existential wholeness
is predicated on the security of this ground, then black existence
itself is always fractured and fragile. **The shift of ground from black
institutions to market forces indicates that social existence will also
shift and bend with the various transitions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We
have at the heart of West's analysis an "ontology of coherence" that
undermines itself; it assumes a coherent self that never existed but is,
instead, the fantasy construction of political hope and its grounding
logic. In other words, West can only restore hope and meaning if he
re-establishes a grounding for black existence, but as this crisis
indicates, any such grounding is subject to shift, transform, or decay.3
[[Meaning itself is an aspect of anti-blackness, such that meaning is
lost for the black; blacks live in a world of absurdity, and this
existential absurdity is meaning for the world. Meaninglessness is
really all there is]{.underline}]{.mark} (or we could say that "real"
meaning for the world is utter meaninglessness). In an interview with
Mark Sinker, Greg Tate provided a reconceptualization of meaning when he
stated, "[the bar between the signifier and the signified]{.mark} could
be understood as [stand]{.mark}ing [for the Middle passage that
separated signification from sign]{.mark}" (Sinker 1991). [[The very
structure of meaning in the modern world---signifier, signified,]{.mark}
signification, and [sign---depends on anti-black violence for its
constitution]{.mark}. Not only does [the trauma of the Middle passage
rupture the signifying process, but]{.mark} it also [instantiates a
"meaningless" sign as the foundation of language, meaning, and social
existence itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} Following the work of Nicolas
Abraham and Maria Torok (1986), we could suggest that the
meaninglessness of anti-black violence is the "crypt-signifier" that
organizes the modern world and its institutions. **[[Any "meaning" that
is articulated possesses a kernel of absurdity that blacks embody as
"fleshy signs."]{.underline}]{.mark}** The "meaninglessness" that Cornel
West bemoans is nothing more than the kernel of nonsense that an
anti-black world attempts to conceal with its discourses of hope and
futurity. [What [the]{.mark} [black nihilist]{.mark} does [is bring this
meaninglessness to the fore and disclose it in all of its terroristic
historicity]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### AT: TVA

#### Aff embraces system hospice, starting from the assumption that modernity is irredeemable and reform thru the system is impossible

Education at University of British Columbia, "Mapping interpretations of

[[Analyses within the soft-reform space call for a form of inclusion or
access that does not require major shifts,]{.underline}]{.mark} whereas
[systemic analyses within the radical-reform space demand a]{.underline}
more [drastic interruption]{.underline} of business-as-usual.
[This]{.underline} interruption [entails transforming the way power and
resources are accumulated by current beneficiaries, in order to make
space for difference and for the redistribution of resources,
opportunities, and symbolic value]{.underline}. Thus, **[[radical-reform
critiques are]{.underline}]{.mark}** often **[[characterized by a
fragmentation in the analyses of oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(single-issue politics) **[[and a strong normative stance focused on
'fixing' an aspect of the]{.mark} [system]{.mark}]{.underline}** [(**[to
make it work for marginalised subjects]{.underline}**]{.mark}),
[**[which ultimately leads to an expansion of the existing, modern
system, rather than enabling alternatives to it]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
[What distinguishes beyond-reform spaces from radical-reform spaces is
the recognition of ontological dominance]{.underline} (largely absent in
the radical-reform space). A[nalyses in this space connect different
dimensions of oppression and reject the idea that the mere addition of
other ways of knowing (through a critique of epistemological dominance)
will ultimately change the system]{.underline}, as dominance is
exercised primarily through the conditioning of particular ways of being
that, in turn, prescribe particular ways of knowing. In other words,
[[the incorporation of multiple ways of knowing]{.underline}]{.mark}
(grafted onto the same hegemonic ontological foundation that is left
unexamined[) [through strategies of equity, access, voice, recognition,
representatio]{.mark}]{.underline}[n]{.mark}, or redistribution, [[does
not change ontological dominance]{.underline}]{.mark} (see also
Coulthard, 2014). [[Within the 'beyond-reform' space, the modern system
itself is perceived as inherently violent, exploitative,]{.mark} and
[unsustainable]{.mark}.]{.underline} Modernity's myriad oppressions are
understood to be interlinked. [[Critiques made from within this space
recognize modernity as irrecoverable;]{.mark} that is, they recognize
the limits of even the most radical transformations that do not disrupt
the underlying modern system and its grammars and logics]{.underline}.
This does not preclude 'beyond-reform' advocates from valuing the
importance of non-ontological transformations as necessary and important
in the short-term, but [[merely advocating for expansion or radical
transformation of the system]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. [[through
equity, access, voice, recognition, representation, or
redistribution]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[is
insufficien]{.underline}t]{.mark}. This form of critique tends to lead
to one of three primary responses: system walk out, hacking, or
'hospicing'. System walk out (alternatives 'with guarantees') enunciates
a commitment to develop alternatives to modernity that will not
reproduce its violences. Alternative communities and epistemologies are
developed or reclaimed in spaces that may be external or marginal to
mainstream institutions, either as supplementary, transitional, or
wholesale alternatives. While 'walking out' often leads to remarkably
creative and generative spaces, these spaces may nonetheless reproduce
at least some of the same problems as modernity, as they are still
broadly situated within its teleological grammar, particularly in its
dialectically structured desire for an uncontaminated 'outside'. This
focus on alternatives 'with guarantees' tends to support the same
affective investments (e.g. in fixed teleologies, normativity,
consensus, and innocence) and can lead to the foreclosure of the
complexities and complicities that arise in the making of
alternatives[.]{.mark} [System hacking involves creating spaces within
the system, using its resources, where people can be educated about the
violences of the system and have their desires re-oriented away from it.
This requires 'playing the game' of institutions at the same time that
rules are bent to generate alternative outcomes.]{.underline} This
strategy can also be remarkably creative and generative; **[however, it
can be difficult to recognize when one is 'hacking' the system or 'being
hacked' by it]{.underline}**. In addition, like system walk outs, **[the
risk of reproducing modernity's violence precisely when one is trying to
move beyond it remains high as the success of initiatives is measured
in]{.underline}** 28 V. de Oliveira Andreotti et al identifiable
outcomes, **[and identities]{.underline}** may become **[scripted around
vanguardist heroism that inadvertently recentres
individuals]{.underline}**. In contrast to system walk out, [[**system
'hospicing' recognizes that although ultimately new systems are
necessary, alternatives articulated from within modernity's frames will
tend to reproduce** it]{.underline}.]{.mark} In identifying modernity's
metaphysical enclosures, hospicing [problematizes the desire to embrace
or reject modernity as a form of desire where modern subjects demand the
world conform to our will]{.underline} (Silva, 2014). Instead,
[[hospicing would entail sitting with a system in decline, learning from
its history, offering palliative care, seeing oneself in that which is
dying, attending to the integrity of the process]{.mark}, dealing with
tantrums, incontinence, anger and hopelessness, '[cleaning up', and
clearing the space for something new]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[This is unlikely to be a glamorous process; it [will entail many
frustrations, an uncertain timeline, and unforeseeable outcomes without
guarantees]{.mark}.]{.underline} Our definition of [hospicing entails
three different insights. One]{.underline}, that [the modern global
capitalist system is]{.underline} unsustainable, and that it is already
[collapsing. Two]{.underline}, that our current languages, [identities
and sense-making are inescapably historically connected to it.
Three,]{.underline} that [we need to be properly taught by the system's
successes and failures by facing its death and attending to its
affliction rather than turning our back or attempting to murder it
before it is ready to go]{.underline}. Hospicing enacts a willingness to
learn enough from the (re)current mistakes of the current system in
order to make different mistakes in caring for the arrival of something
new. [Going through the pains of this death]{.underline}, and
[[recognizing we have been both bewildered and enchanted by the
mythology of the Enlightenment, may be the only way we c an really
understand the depth of modernity's limits]{.mark} (within
us]{.underline}) and recognize its real gifts. [[Hospicing
demands]{.underline}]{.mark} a critique that is self-implicated rather
than heroic, vanguardist or 'innocent'. It demands [a [kind of courage
that is]{.mark} un-neurotic [(not invested in
self-affirmation]{.mark}]{.underline}[):]{.mark} a kind of courage [that
helps us to look the bull in the eye, to recognize ourselves in the
bull, and to see the bull as a teacher, precisely when it is trying to
kill us]{.underline}. In practice, this means [that experimenting with
alternatives is perceived as important not for generating predetermined
solutions, but rather as a means to be taught by the successes and
failures of the experimentation process]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} teachings [are indispensible]{.underline} for
exploring the depths of the existing system, and for learning [to
discern between its poisons and its medicines]{.underline}. In this
space, the effects of violence and pain are attended to; at the same
time [that there is also an acute attention to the roots and mechanisms
of the disease so that its death leaves a legacy of prudence that
grounds the emergence of something radically new and potentially
wiser]{.underline}. We represent this possibility as a question mark [in
our fourth space]{.underline} where [other modes of existence grounded
on different cosmologies operate]{.underline}. The question mark
indicates that [these are unintelligible to those entrapped in the
metaphysics of modernity]{.underline} (which does not mean they are
separate from our experience, or beyond meaning and understanding).

period, [I began to see how essential an unflinching paradigmatic
analysis is to a movement dedicated to the complete overthrow of an
existing order]{.mark}. The [neoliberal compromises that the radical

due]{.mark}, in large part, [to our inability or unwillingness to hold
the moderates\' feet to the fire of a political agenda predicated on an

### AT: Reform TVAs

**The only ethical demand calls for the end of the world itself---their
"competing models" are utopian fantasies that are weaponized against
native and black people**

**Wilderson, '10** \[2010, Frank B. Wilderson is an Associate Professor
of African-American Studies at UC Irvine and has a Ph.D. from UC
Berkeley, "Red, White & Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S.
Antagonisms,"\]

Leaving aside for the moment their state of mind, it would seem that
[the structure]{.underline}, that is to say the rebar, or better still
the grammar [of their demands]{.underline}---and, by extension, the
grammar of their suffering---[was]{.underline} indeed an
[ethical]{.underline} grammar. Perhaps [[their grammars are the only
ethical grammars available to modern politics and modernity]{.mark} writ
large]{.underline}, for [they draw our attention not to the way in which
space and time are used and abused by enfranchised and violently
powerful interests, but to [the violence that underwrites the modern
world's capacity to think, act, and exist spatially and
temporally]{.mark}.]{.underline} The violence that robbed her of her
body and him of his land provided the stage upon which other violent and
consensual dramas could be enacted. Thus, [they would have to be
crazy]{.underline}, crazy enough [to call not merely the actions of the
world to account but to call the world itself to account]{.underline},
and to account for them no less! [[The woman]{.underline}]{.mark} at
Columbia [[was not demanding to be a participant in an unethical
network]{.mark} of distribution: [she was not demanding a place
within]{.mark} capital, a piece of the pie]{.underline} (the demand for
her sofa notwithstanding). Rather, she was articulating a triangulation
between, on the one hand, the loss of her body, the very dereliction of
her corporeal integrity, what Hortense Spillers charts as the transition
from being a being to becoming a "being for the captor" (206), the drama
of value (the stage upon which surplus value is extracted from labor
power through commodity production and sale); and on the other, the
corporeal integrity that, once ripped from her body, fortified and
extended the corporeal integrity of everyone else on the street. She
gave birth to the commodity and to the Human, yet [she had neither
subjectivity nor a sofa to show for it.]{.underline} In her eyes, [the
world---and not its myriad discriminatory practices, [but the world
itself---was unethical]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} And yet, [the
world passes by her without the slightest inclination to stop and
disabuse her of her claim]{.underline}. Instead, it calls her "crazy."
And to what does the world attribute the Native American man's insanity?
"He's crazy if he thinks he's getting any money out of us"? Surely, that
doesn't make him crazy. Rather [it is simply an indication that he does
not have a big enough gun. What are we to make of a world that responds
to the most lucid enunciation of ethics with violence?]{.underline} What
are the foundational questions of the ethico-political? Why are these
questions so scandalous that they are rarely posed politically,
intellectually, and cinematically---unless they are posed obliquely and
unconsciously, as if by accident? **[[Return Turtle Island to the

words, and the structure of U.S. (and perhaps global) antagonisms would
be dismantled]{.mark}.]{.underline} [An "ethical modernity" would no
longer sound like an oxymoron]{.underline}. From there [we could busy
ourselves with important conflicts that have been promoted to the level
of antagonisms: [class struggle]{.mark}, [gender conflict, immigrants
rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} When pared down to thirteen words and two
sentences, [one cannot but wonder why questions that go to the heart of
the ethico-political, questions of political ontology, are so
unspeakable in intellectual meditations, political
broadsides]{.underline}, and even socially and politically engaged
feature films. Clearly they can be spoken, even a child could speak
those lines, so they would pose no problem for a scholar, an activist,
or a filmmaker. And yet, what is also clear---if the filmographies of
socially and politically engaged directors, the [archive of progressive
scholars, and the plethora of Left-wing broadsides are anything to go
by---is that what can so easily be spoken is now (five hundred years and
two hundred fifty million Settlers/Masters on) [so ubiquitously unspoken
that these two simple sentences, these thirteen words not only render
their speaker "crazy" but become themselves impossible to
imagine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Soon it will be forty years since radical
politics, Left-leaning scholarship, and socially engaged feature films
began to speak the unspeakable. In the 1960s and early 1970s [[the
questions asked]{.mark} by radical politics and scholarship [were not
"Should the U.S. be overthrown?" or even "Would it be overthrown?" **but
rather when and how**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and, for some,
what---[would come in its wake. Those steadfast in their conviction that
there remained a discernable quantum of ethics in the U.S. writ
large]{.underline} (and here I am speaking of everyone from Martin
Luther King, Jr., prior to his 1968 shift, to the Tom Hayden wing of
SDS, to the Julian Bond and Marion Barry faction of SNCC, to Bobbie
Kennedy Democrats) [were accountable,]{.underline} in their rhetorical
machinations, [to the paradigmatic zeitgeist of the Black Panthers, the
American Indian Movement, and the Weather Underground. Radicals and
[progressives could deride, reject, or chastise]{.mark} armed struggle
mercilessly and cavalierly with respect to tactics and the possibility
of "success," but they could not dismiss revolution-as-ethic because
[they could not make a convincing case]{.mark}]{.underline}---by way of
a paradigmatic analysis---[[that the U.S. was an ethical formation and
still hope to maintain credibility as radicals and
progressives]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Even Bobby Kennedy]{.underline} (a
U.S. attorney general and presidential candidate) [mused that the law
and its enforcers had no ethical standing in the presence of
Blacks]{.underline}. One could (and many did) acknowledge America's
strength and power. [This seldom,]{.underline} however, [rose to the
level of an ethical assessment, but rather remained an assessment of the
so-called "balance of forces."]{.underline} The political discourse of
Blacks, and to a lesser extent Indians, circulated too widely to
credibly wed the U.S. and ethics. The raw force of COINTELPRO put an end
to this trajectory toward a possible hegemony of ethical accountability.
Consequently, [[the power of Blackness and Redness to pose the
question]{.mark}---[and the power to pose the question is the greatest
power of all]{.mark}---[retreated as did White radicals and progressives
who "retired" from struggle.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The question's echo
lies buried in the graves of young Black Panthers, AIM Warriors, and
Black Liberation Army soldiers, or in prison cells where so many of them
have been rotting]{.underline} (some in solitary confinement) [for ten,
twenty, thirty years, and at the gates of the academy where the
"crazies" shout at passers-by. Gone are not only the young and vibrant
voices that affected a seismic shift on the political landscape, but
also the intellectual protocols of inquiry, and with them]{.underline} a
spate of feature films that became authorized, if not by an unabashed
revolutionary polemic, then certainly by [a revolutionary
zeitgeist]{.underline}. [Is it still possible for a dream of unfettered
ethics, a dream of the Settlement and the Slave estate's destruction, to
manifest itself]{.underline} at the ethical core of cinematic discourse,
[when this dream is no longer a constituent element of political
discourse]{.underline} in the streets nor of intellectual discourse in
the academy? The answer is "no" in the sense that, as history has shown,
what cannot be articulated as political discourse in the streets is
doubly foreclosed upon in screenplays and in scholarly prose; but "yes"
in the sense that in [even the most taciturn historical moments such as
ours, the grammar of Black and Red suffering breaks in on this
foreclosure]{.underline}, albeit like the somatic compliance of
hysterical symptoms---it registers in both cinema and scholarship as
symptoms of awareness of the structural antagonisms. Between 1967 and
1980, we could think cinematically and intellectually of Blackness and
Redness as having the coherence of full-blown discourses. But from 1980
to the present, [Blackness and Redness manifests only in the rebar
of]{.underline} cinematic and [intellectual (political)
discourse]{.underline}, that is, [as unspoken grammars]{.underline}.
[This grammar can be discerned in the cinematic]{.underline} strategies
(lighting, camera angles, image composition, and acoustic
strategies/design), even [when the script labors for the spectator to
imagine social turmoil through the rubric of conflict]{.underline}
([that is, a rubric of problems that can be posed and conceptually
solved)]{.underline} [as opposed to the rubric of antagonism (an
irreconcilable struggle between entities, or positionalities, the
resolution of which is not dialectical but entails the obliteration of
one of the positions]{.underline}). In other words, even when films
narrate a story in which Blacks or Indians are beleaguered with problems
that the script insists are conceptually coherent (usually having to do
with poverty or the absence of "family values"), the non-narrative, or
cinematic, strategies of the film often disrupt this coherence by posing
the irreconcilable questions of Red and Black political ontology---or
non-ontology. [The grammar of antagonism breaks in on the mendacity of
conflict.]{.underline} Semiotics and linguistics teach us that when we
speak, our grammar goes unspoken. Our grammar is assumed. It is the
structure through which the labor of speech is possible. Likewise, [the
grammar of political ethics]{.underline}---the grammar of assumptions
[regarding [the ontology of]{.mark} [suffering]{.mark}---which
[underwrite]{.mark}]{.underline} Film Theory and [[political
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} (in this book, discourse elaborated in
direct relation to radical action), and which underwrite cinematic
speech (in this book, Red, White, and Black films from the mid-1960s to
the present) [is also unspoken]{.underline}. This notwithstanding, film
theory, [political discourse]{.underline}, and cinema [assume an
ontological grammar, a structure of suffering]{.underline}. And [the
structure of suffering]{.underline} which film theory, political
discourse, and cinema assume [[crowds out other structures of
suffering]{.mark}, regardless of the sentiment of the film or the spirit
of unity mobilized by the political discourse in question]{.underline}.
To put a finer point on it, [[structures of ontological suffering stand
in antagonistic, rather then conflictual, relation]{.mark} to one
another]{.underline} (despite the fact that antagonists themselves may
not be aware of the ontological positionality from which they speak).
Though this is perhaps the most controversial and out-of-step claim of
this book, it is, nonetheless, the foundation of the close reading of
feature films and political theory that follows.

### AT: Reform Good

#### The affirmative project of self-care fails to address the nature of an anti-black world -- their project creates a condition of self-injury that ultimately get mapped over in discussions of humanist redress

**Warren**, Assistant Professor of American Studies, **2015** (Calvin,
research fellow at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in Africology,
\"Black Nihilism and the Politics of Hope\", CR: The New Centennial
Review, 15.1, accessed on 9/26/15, BEN)

[For West]{.underline}, this crisis of [meaning and hope can be
rectified through [the "politics of conversion]{.mark}"]{.underline} (we
can read in this Kierkegaard's idea of a "conversion experience"). [This
is deliverance from the bondage of market moralism, which results in the
"politicization of love"---**[conceptualizing love as an organizing
political principle]{.mark}**]{.underline} (another spiritual principle
appropriated by the Political). West identifies Toni Morrison's
masterpiece Beloved as an example of this ethic of love that converts
the self-destructive nihilist. Beloved teaches us how to "generate a
sense of agency among a downtrodden people" (29). [But West **[neglects
the trauma that organizes this text and the nihilistic response]{.mark}
to this trauma [as the only form of "agency" in an absurd anti-black
world]{.mark}**. Racial terror compels [Sethe]{.mark} to leave the
plantation with her children, and the threat her children [could be
recaptured]{.mark} and subjected to the horrors of the plantation
motivates her to [make a very heavy decision:]{.mark} the choice
[between prolonged social death or physical death]{.mark}. These are
really the only choices that she has, and her ethic of love is to choose
the latter---it is an act of mercy. We could say that [Sethe becomes a
nihilist in that moment of decision]{.mark}, and [infanticide is not an
irrational, pathological, or loveless act, but the ultimate testament of
agency and love]{.mark}. This is what Paul D could not understand
because it [contravened the narratives of political hope and
futurity]{.mark}; her act was read as cruel by those who attempted to
translate the absurd "false choice" that structured her existence into a
bio-political grammar of meaning. It is certainly "inappropriate" to
disregard this weighty decision as "loveless" or "hopeless," for in
doing so, we fail to understand the philosophical statement her action
is articulating. [This is a philosophical statement that understands the
inadequacy of political hope in conditions of anti-black
violence.]{.mark}]{.underline} [It is easy to disparage behavior that
runs contrary to the dictates of a bio-political order. **[Black
nihilism invites us to consider this behavior as a form of philosophical
discourse that must be addressed. In separating the behavior from its
philosophical statement, we not only run the risk of pathologizing forms
of blackness but also of foreclosing a particular critique of political
hope that is absolutely necessary to understand black existential angst
in the twenty-first century]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In "Cornel West and
Afro-Nihilism: A Reconsideration," Floyd W. Hayes (2001) offers an
alternative reading of black nihilism that considers it a "reaction to
the dominant culture's nihilism" and a critique of anti-blackness. In
Hayes's masterful critique of West, he interprets this behavior as a
form of ressentiment. Following Nietzsche and Scheler, Hayes argues that
[horri is a critique of metaphysical thinking, anti-black absurdity, and
inequitable distribution of resources]{.underline}. It is a "historical
and contemporary phenomenon" (251) [that emerges during the
trans-Atlantic slave trade and calcifies over time. These sentiments of
[anger, revenge, and rage engender rebellion,]{.mark} and what is [often
misinterpreted as black pathology. Ressentiment,]{.mark} then[, is the
meeting ground for an array of responses to antiblackness, and it
challenges the erroneous separation of behavior and philosophy]{.mark}.
[Black nihilism]{.mark}]{.underline}, in my analysis, [[acknowledges the
persistence of ressentiment, but]{.mark},]{.underline} unlike Hayes,
[[posits no escape]{.mark} from it. [The inability to ameliorate
ressentiment is the essence of black suffering. Ressentiment constitutes
torment without relief, and the desperation for relief results in forms
of self-injury, in which the body must speak the existential crisis that
gets muted within humanist grammars]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In
Hope on the Brink: Understanding the Emergence of Nihilism in Black
America, theologian Lewis Brogdon (2013) would describe this theory of
unresolvable torment as the "death of hope." For Brogdon, this death is
even more severe than West's nihilism. This death is something that
Brogdon mourns throughout the text with the assurance that it can be
resurrected. The hope that he pines for is really political hope, for
the hope that is lost is a hope in the efficacy of the Political to
redress the injuries of anti-black violence. Brogdon believes that the
withdrawal of political hope leads to despair. Reflecting on this lost
hope, Brogdon suggests: And today, the black community is increasingly
populated by people whose hope in a just and equitable society either
died a long time ago or continues to die as they face stifling social
inequities and disappointing economic disparities. I heard a similar
comment while teaching a study on why the church struggles with the
issue of racism. One older congregant from the Civil Rights generation
said, "We already heard that and tried that. Nothing has changed."
Instead of working for change, some blacks, like this congregant, choose
to respond to the permanence of racial inequality by retreating from the
struggle altogether, accepting the inequitable nature of society as
permanent, after having one's hope die a slow, painful death. (42) The
challenge that the "older congregant" put to Brogdon was a serious one.
If Brogdon admonishes her to keep political hope alive, then he must
answer the question "why?" For this congregant, we have exhausted the
discourses of humanism and the strategies of equality---nothing has
worked. Brogdon sidesteps this challenge by presenting "working for
change" as a viable option, which is really a non-answer. What type of
"work" will bring about the promises of the Political? Is there a type
of work that will, once and for all, alleviate black suffering? Why
would someone continue to do the same thing repeatedly without any
substantial change (some would say this is the definition of insanity)?
Brodgon leaves these nihilistic questions unanswered, precisely because
they are unanswerable, and, instead, continues to exhort blacks to
struggle for the fantasy object. This struggle is presented as a
spiritual virtue, and the spiritual concept of hope is contaminated with
the prerogatives of a political order. This problematic conflation is
never adequately explained. Why is continued hope in an anti-black
political order a sign of spiritual maturity? And if this order is
redeemable, then it is the obligation of the advocate to explain how
this redemption will occur. This merging of the spiritual and the
political creates a flawed theology that either endangers people or
necessitates living in what Lewis Gordon would call "bad faith" in Bad
Faith and Anti-black Racism (1995). [Perhaps it is [the retreat from the
Political]{.mark} that [is the ultimate sign of spiritual
maturity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Political Hope Bad

#### In the face of anti-black violence, you must abandon political hope and ethically refuse to enter the political arena

**Warren**, Assistant Professor of American Studies, **2015** (Calvin,
research fellow at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in Africology,
\"Black Nihilism and the Politics of Hope\", CR: The New Centennial
Review, 15.1, accessed on 9/26/15, BEN)

[For West and Brogdon, nihilism is a spiritual-psychic disorder that
requires a spiritual antidote. In this configuration of the spiritual,
the nihilist is in need of deliverance---deliverance from the bondage of
"hope-death."]{.underline} We might, however, [think of the nihilists
not as the fleshly embodiment of "hope-death" but as spiritualists
invested in the deliverance of the spiritual from the clutches of the
Political. [The black nihilist]{.mark}, in this regard, [is profoundly
spiritual and addresses the contamination of the spiritual by its
political sequelae]{.mark}. Unlike the political-theologian, [the
nihilist does not promise redress within the structure of the political,
for this is impossible, but offers, instead, rejection of the political
as a spiritual practice itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}4 In a very
thought-provoking discussion published in Religious Dispatches about the
murder of Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman's acquittal, J. Kameron
Carter, Anthea Butler, and Willie James Jennings conceptualize
anti-blackness as a form of spiritual idolatry (Carter 2013). Evoking
the seminal text Is God a White Racist? (1973), written by Dr. William
R. Jones, these scholars suggest that [anti-black political organization
is often anchored in a racist theology---one that considers
anti-blackness God's will.]{.underline} Jones put the theodicy question
to Black Liberation theologians and questioned this undying fealty to a
liberation grounded in political reconfiguration and emancipatory
rhetoric. [Is God a White Racist? not only articulates [the disjuncture
between emancipatory "hope" and the devastating reality of black
suffering]{.mark} but also [questions the place of the Political]{.mark}
within this liberation theology. [This theology]{.mark}, indeed,
[presupposes certain metaphysical assumptions about the
Political---progress, linear time, and agency]{.mark}---and Jones
reveals a certain paradox within liberation theology: [it is grounded in
the Political but lacks a strong political philosophy to justify this
grounding]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., a philosophy that connects the
theological to the Political). This becomes even more problematic
because these metaphysical presumptions are themselves instruments of
anti-blackness. [[Anti-blackness]{.underline}]{.mark}, ironically,
[[becomes the very foundation for the purported liberation from
anti-blackness in this theology]{.mark}. This is precisely the
contradiction that Jones intimates throughout the text, and it is [this
entanglement]{.mark} that [renders political liberation]{.mark} somewhat
of [a ruse]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the article "Christian Atheism: The
Only Response Worth Its Salt to the Zimmerman Verdict" (2013), J.
Kameron Carter perspicuously foregrounds the problem of the Zimmerman
verdict as a perverse deification of anti-blackness. If the shooting of
Trayvon Martin was "god's will," as Zimmerman expressed to Sean Hannity
in an interview, then this god considered black death a moral
imperative, or an act of righteousness, and Zimmerman, in shooting
Trayvon Martin, assumed the role of the obedient disciple. For Carter,
this god is nothing more than an idol, a spiritual imposture created by
modernity and its institutions: [[The white, western god-man is an idol
that seeks to determine]{.mark} what is normal. It is [a norm by which
society governs the body politic]{.mark} or regulates, measures,
evaluates, and indeed judges what is proper or improper, what is
acceptable citizenship. It is this idol, the idol of "[the American
god]{.mark}," that [is the symbolic figure Zimmerman identified
himself]{.mark} with and in relationship to which he [judges Trayvon
Martin as]{.mark}, in effect, [religiously wanting]{.mark}---wanting in
proper citizenship, and ultimately wanting in humanity.]{.underline} (3)
The "white, western-god-man" (or the "American god") that Carter
describes bears resemblance to what Sylvia Wynter would call "Man"
(2003, 322)---both are philosophical-theological apparatuses of
anti-blackness, and they function to colonize essential spheres of
existence ("Man" colonizes human and the "white, western-god-man"
colonizes God). [The "white, western-god-man" and "Man" index a process
of extreme epistemological and metaphysical violence, and this violence
serves as the foundation of Western society and its politics. The only
response to this epistemological and metaphysical violence]{.underline},
according to Carter, [is atheism]{.underline}. It is here that we hear
an uncanny resonance with Ernest Bloch's Atheism in Christianity (1971),
in which "a good Christian must necessarily be a good atheist." True
Christianity necessitates a certain atheism---in fact it depends on
it---to fortify the boundaries between the just/ unjust and the
righteous/unrighteous. In other words, when a Christian encounters the
idol of anti-blackness, she must assume an atheistic posture toward this
idol to remain faithful (or as Carter would describe it to be "worth
your salt"). [The atheism that Carter proffers]{.underline}, however,
[is entangled in the metaphysical bind that sustains the very violence
his atheism is designed to dismantle]{.underline}. For him, [this
atheism entails "social, political, and intellectual struggle\...
struggle in solidarity with others, the struggle to be for and with
others, the struggle of the multitude, the struggle that is blackness
\[as\] the new ecclesiology]{.underline}" (2013, 4). [[The term
"struggle]{.mark}" here [presents political metaphysics as a solution to
the problem of anti-blackness]{.mark}---through labor, travail, and
commitment [one embraces progress and linearity as social goods.]{.mark}
With this metaphysics]{.underline}, according to Carter, [we can
"struggle to get rid of these 'Stand Your Ground' Laws that are in place
in many states besides Florida, struggle against state
legislatures]{.underline} (such as North Carolina's) that are enacting
draconian laws of various sorts, struggle in the name of the protection
of women's agency about their own bodies---in short, struggle to imagine
a new politics of belonging" (4). This struggle contains the promise of
overcoming anti-blackness to usher in a "not-yet-social-order." Again,
the trick of time is deployed to protect "struggle" from the rigorous
historical analysis that would demand evidence of its efficacy. [[The
"not-yet-social-order," situated in an irreproachable future]{.mark} (a
political prolepsis), [can only promise this overcoming against a
history and historicity of brutal anti-black social
organization.]{.mark}]{.underline} Carter is looking for a political
theology---although we've always had one under the guise of democratic
liberalism---that will provide conditions of life by mobilizing the
discourses of hope and future temporality. [The problem that this
theology encircles, and evades, is the failure of "social justice" and
"liberation theology" to dismantle the structure of anti-black
violence;]{.underline} this brings us full circle to the problem that
Dr. William R. Jones brilliantly articulated. Are we hoping for a new
strategy, something completely novel and unique, that will resolve all
the problems of the Political once and for all? If the Political itself
is the "temple" of the idolatrous god---the sphere within which it is
worshipped and preserved---can we discard the idol and purify the
temple? Does this theology offer a political philosophy of purification
that will sustain the "progress" that struggle is purported to achieve?
In short, how does one translate the spiritual principle of hope into a
political program---apolitical theology? [[The problem of translation
haunts this theology and the looking-forward stance of the political
theologian cannot avoid the rupture between the spiritual and the
Political]{.underline}]{.mark}. Can we reject this racist god and, at
the same time, support the political structure that affirms this idol?
Can we be "partial" atheists? This becomes a problem for Carter when he
suggests that we abandon this idol but fails to critique the structure
of political existence, which sustains the power of this idol. Atheism
as imagined here would entail rejecting the racist-white-god, or a
racist political theology, and replacing it with a just God, or an
equitable political theology. [[Will replacing the idol with a more just
God transform the Political into a life-affirming structure for
blackness]{.mark}? Unless we advocate for a theocracy, which is not what
I believe Carter would propose, we need an answer to this question of
translation. The answer to this question is glaringly absent in the
text, but I read this absence as an attempt to avoid the nihilistic
conclusion that his argument would naturally reach.]{.underline} We
might even suggest that one must assume a nihilistic disposition toward
the Political if justice, redress, and righteousness are the aims. [The
problem with atheism]{.underline}, then, [is that it relies on the
Political as the sphere of redemption and hope, when the Political is
part of the idolatrous structure that it seeks to
dismantle.]{.underline} In this sense, Dr. William R. Jones becomes an
aporia for Dr. Kameron Carter's text, if we read Jones as suggesting
that black theology offers no cogent political philosophy, or political
program, that would successfully rid the Political of its anti-black
foundation. [[The Political and anti-blackness are inseparable and
mutually constitutive. The utopian vision of a "not-yet-social order"
that purges anti-blackness from its core provides a promise without
relief---its only answer to the immediacy of black suffering is to keep
struggling]{.mark}. [The logic of struggle]{.mark}, then, [perpetuates
black suffering by placing relief in an unattainable future, a future
that offers nothing more than an exploitative reproduction of its own
means of existence. Struggle, action, work, and labor are caught in a
political metaphysics that depends on black-death]{.mark}. The black
nihilist recognizes that relying on the Political and its grammar offers
nothing more than a ruse of transformation and an exploited
hope]{.underline}. Instead of atheism, [[**the black nihilist would
embrace political apostasy:** **it is the act of abandoning or
renouncing a situation of unethicality and immorality**]{.mark}--- in
this sense, **[the Political itself]{.mark}**. The apostate is a figure
that "[self-excommunicates]{.mark}" him-/herself [from a body that is
contrary to its fundamental belief system]{.mark}. As political
apostate, [the black nihilist renounces the idol of anti-blackness but
refuses to participate in the ruse of replacing one idol with
another]{.mark}. The Political and God]{.underline}---the just and true
God in Carter's analysis--- [are incommensurate and inimical. This is
not to suggest that we can exclude God, but that [any recourse to the
Political results in an immorality not in alignment with Godly
principles (a performative contradiction).]{.mark} The project to align
God with the Political (political theology) will inevitably fail. If
anti-blackness is contrary to our beliefs, self-excommunication, in
other words "black nihilism," is the only position that seems
consistent. We can think of political apostasy]{.underline}, then, [as
an active nihilism when an "alternative" political arrangement is
impossible. **[When faced with the impossibility of realizing the
"not-yet-social order," political apostasy becomes an empowered
hermeneutical practice; it interprets the anti-black Political symbolic
as inherently wicked and rejects it both as critique and spiritual
practice.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### The politics of hope is dependent on the myth of meritocracy --but incremental change never disrupts structural anti-blackness

**Warren**, Assistant Professor of American Studies, **2015** (Calvin,
research fellow at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in Africology,
\"Black Nihilism and the Politics of Hope\", CR: The New Centennial
Review, 15.1)

Throughout this essay, I have argued that [[the Politics of hope
preserve metaphysical structures that sustain black
suffering]{.mark}.]{.underline} This preservation amounts to an
exploitation of hope[---when [the Political colonizes the spiritual
principle of hope and puts it in the service of extending the "will to
power" of an anti-black organization of existence]{.mark}. **The
Politics of hope**]{.underline}, then, [**is [bound up with metaphysical
violence]{.mark}, and this violence [masquerades as a "solution"
to]{.mark} the problem of [anti-blackness]{.mark}. Temporal
[linearity]{.mark}, perfection, betterment, [struggle]{.mark}, work, and
[utopian futurity]{.mark} are conceptual instruments of the Political
that will never obviate black suffering or anti-black
violence**;]{.underline} these concepts only serve to reproduce the
conditions that render existence unbearablefor blacks. Political
theologians and [black optimists [avoid the immediacy of black
suffering]{.mark}, the horror of anti-black pulverization, and [place
relief in a "not-yet-but-is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[(maybe)-to-come-social order" that]{.mark}, itself, can do little more
but [admonish blacks to survive to keep struggling]{.mark}. **[Political
hope becomes a]{.mark} vicious and abusive cycle of struggle**---it
mirrors the [Lacanian drive]{.mark}, and [we encircle an
object]{.mark}]{.underline} (black freedom, justice, relief, redress,
equality, etc.) [[that]{.mark} is inaccessible because it [doesn't
really exist]{.mark}. [**The** political theologian]{.mark} and **black
optimis**t, then, **[propose a collective Jouissance]{.mark} as an
answer to black suffering**---[finding]{.mark} the joy in struggle, the
victory in toil, and the [satisfaction in inefficacious action]{.mark}.
**[We]{.mark} continue to "[struggle]{.mark}" and "work" [as black youth
are slaughtered daily]{.mark}, black bodies are incarcerated as forms of
capital, black infant mortality rates are soaring, and hunger is
disabling the bodies, minds, and spirits of desperate black
youth**.]{.underline} In short, [[these conditions are]{.mark} deep
[metaphysical]{.mark} problems---the sadistic pleasure of metaphysical
domination--- and ["work" and "struggle" avoid the terrifying fact that
the world depends on Black Death to sustain itself.]{.mark} [Black
nihilism attempts to]{.mark} break this "drive"]{.underline}---to stop
it in its tracks, as it were---[and to [end the cycle of
insanity]{.mark} that political hope perpetuates]{.underline}. The
question that remains is a question often put to the black nihilist:
what is the point? This compulsory geometrical structuring of
thought---all knowledge must submit to, and is reducible to, a
point---it is an epistemic flicker of certainty, determination, and, to
put it bluntly, life. [**"[The point" exists]{.mark} for life**; it
enlivens, enables, and sustains knowledge. [Thought outside of this
mandatory point is illegible]{.mark} and useless. To write outside of
the "episteme of life" and its grammar will require a position outside
of this point, a position somewhere in the infinite horizon of
thought]{.underline} (perhaps this is what Heidegger wanted to do with
his reconfiguration of thought). Writing in this way is inherently
subversive and refuses the geometry of thought. Nevertheless, [the
nihilist is forced to enunciate]{.underline} his/her [\[their\] refusal
through a "point," a point that is contradictory and paradoxical all at
once. To say that the point of this essay is that "the point" is
fraudulent---]{.underline}its promise of clarity and life are
inadequate[--- will not satisfy the hunger of disciplining the nihilist
and insisting that one undermine the very ground upon which one stands.
[Black nihilistic hermeneutics resists "the point" but is subjected to
it to have one's voice heard within the marketplace of ideas]{.mark}.
**The "point" of this essay is that political hope is pointless. Black
suffering is an essential part of the world, and placing hope in the
very structure that sustains metaphysical violence, the Political, will
never resolve anything.** This is why [the black nihilist speaks of
"exploited hope]{.mark}," and the black nihilist [attempts to wrest hope
from the clutches of the Political]{.mark}.]{.underline} Can we think of
hope outside the Political[? Must "salvation" translate into a political
grammar or a political program? [The nihilist]{.mark}, then, [hopes for
the end of political hope and its metaphysical violence]{.mark}.
Nihilism is not antithetical to hope; it [does not extinguish hope but
reconfigures it]{.mark}. Hope is the foundation of the black nihilistic
hermeneutic]{.underline}. In "Blackness and Nothingness," Fred Moten
(2013) conceptualizes blackness as a "pathogen" to metaphysics,
something that has the ability to unravel, to disable, and to destroy
anti-blackness. If we read Vattimo through Moten's brilliant analysis,
we can suggest that blackness is the limit that Heidegger and Nietzsche
were really after. It is [[a "blackened" world]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[will ultimately end metaphysics]{.mark}, but putting an end to
[metaphysics will also put an end to the world itself]{.mark}---this is
the nihilism that the black nihilist must theorize through]{.underline}.
This is a far cry from what we call "anarchy," however. [The black
nihilist has as little faith in the metaphysical reorganization of
society through anarchy than]{.underline} he/she does [\[they do\] in
traditional forms of political existence. [The black nihilist offers
political apostasy as the spiritual practice of denouncing metaphysical
violence, black suffering, and the idol of antiblackness. The act of
renouncing will not change political structures or offer a political
program; instead, it is the act of retrieving the spiritual concept of
hope from the captivity of the Political]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Ultimately, **[it is impossible to end metaphysics without ending
blackness, and the black nihilist will never be able to withdraw from
the Political completely without a certain death-drive or
being-toward-death. This is the essence of black suffering: the lack of
reprieve from metaphysics, the tormenting complicity in the reproduction
of violence, and the lack of a coherent grammar to articulate these
dilemmas.]{.underline}** After contemplating these issues for some time
in my office, I decided to take a train home. As I awaited my train in
the station, an older black woman asked me about the train schedule and
when I would expect the next train headed toward Dupont Circle. When I
told her the trains were running slowly, she began to talk about the
government shutdown. "They don't care anything about us, you know," she
said. "We elect these people into office, we vote for them, and they
watch black people suffer and have no intentions of doing anything about
it." I shook my head in agreement and listened intently. "I'm going to
stop voting, and supporting this process; why should I keep doing this
and our people continue to suffer," she said. I looked at her and said,
"I don't know ma'am; I just don't understand it myself." She then
laughed and thanked me for listening to her---as if our conversation
were somewhat cathartic. "You know, people think you're crazy when you
say things like this," she said giving me a wink. "Yes they do," I said.
"But I am a free woman," she emphasized "and I won't go back." Shocked,
I smiled at her, and she winked at me; at that moment I realized that
her wisdom and courage penetrated my mind and demanded answers. I've
thought about this conversation for some time, and it is for this reason
I had to write this essay. To the brave woman at the train station, I
must say you are not crazy at all but thinking outside of metaphysical
time, space, and violence. Ultimately, we must hope for the end of
political hope.
