## AFFIRMATIVE

### Perm Do Both

#### Military assistance [does not]{.underline} trade off with State Department involvement

**Early 11**, Lt Col, USAF (Billie, "IMPLICATIONS OF THE MILITARIZATION
OF US FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH SECURITY ASSISTANCE," *Air War College*,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1018707.pdf>)//BB

When the three indicators of militarization are applied to DOD's
security assistance efforts, results indicate that [the United States
relies **heavily** on DOD to pursue foreign policy objectives, but **not
at the expense** of State Department responsibilities. DOD uses security
cooperation to build relationships with partner nations and respond to
humanitarian efforts, and uses security assistance as a flexible tool to
build the capacity of foreign military forces so they can respond to
threats in their regions before conditions require a greater US military
response]{.underline}. Whenever possible, [DOD proactively shapes the
global security environment promoting US interests. DOD has the option
to use its new Section 1206 authority to respond to urgent and emerging
threats based on regional command priorities, or to influence
longer-term State Department programs in support of country
requirements]{.underline}. Also, [DOD's considerable force presence and
commander influence can sway security assistance decisions favorably
toward US interests. However, the State Department maintains a **high
degree of direct involvement** and oversight in all security assistance
decisions]{.underline}.

#### Close collaboration is good

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[A key aspect of the success of the security cooperation enterprise is
the **collaboration** among and within the Department, most notably
DoD's close **collaboration** with the State Department ensures that
programs are designed and executed with broader national security
interests in mind]{.underline}. Internal to the Department of Defense,
we recently reorganized -- bringing the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency under the umbrella of Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities in the
Office of the Secretary of the Defense for Policy to facilitate better
collaboration and coordination. Success requires teamwork, and I can
assure you that our entire team is focused on embracing it.

### Perm Do CP

#### Security cooperation includes the DOS

MAJ Nicholas R. **Simontis, 13** - U.S. Army School of Advanced Military
Studies United States Army Command and General Staff College Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas "SECURITY COOPERATION: AN OLD PRACTICE FOR NEW
TIMES" <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA589722.pdf>

How we deal with our adversaries is changing in response to these
developments in the security environment. How we deal with our
international allies and partners also should change. [For many years,
the term "security cooperation" referred to efforts by the]{.underline}
Department of Defense [(DOD) to promote U.S. security]{.underline}
interests through the interaction with and development of friendly and
allied security capabilities.2 [This definition is
evolving]{.underline}, however, [as illustrated by recent strategic
documents and statements by the President and Secretary of
Defense.]{.underline}3 [The term as used recently includes synchronized
efforts by the whole-of-government to build the security
capacity]{.underline} of U.S. friends and allies, [including the
development of economic and political capabilities]{.underline}. The
most recent strategic guidance calls for increased emphasis on an
interagency and interorganizational approach to building partner
capacity and capability, focused on promoting stability and preventing
conflict before it begins, all within a framework that emphasizes
governance and rule of law. Put another way, recent strategic guidance
advocates a whole-of-government approach as the means for translating
national security objectives into the outcome of increased partner
capacity. This change represents recognition that a wide variety of
skill sets is necessary to address these changes in the security
environment. Unfortunately, this change presents challenges for current
security cooperation practices.

The current structure of security cooperation, that is, the
infrastructure of government agencies that participate in security
cooperation activities, does not readily support this new guidance. The
current security cooperation organization originated in the aftermath of
World War II, and continued to evolve through the Cold War. Although the
Department of State ([DOS) has responsibility for planning and executing
security cooperation]{.underline}, the system primarily addresses the
military component of security in terms of equipment and training. The
DOD, under the auspices of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) executes these portions of U.S. Security cooperation endeavors,
which constitute the preponderance of efforts, both in terms of labor
and fund allocation. Furthermore, the DOD's share has grown considerably
in the past five years as Congress significantly increased funding
authorities in order to facilitate stabilization in Iraq and
Afghanistan.4 **[The key issue]{.underline}**, then, [is how to shift
the emphasis from the Department of Defense to efforts shared among
Defense, State, USAID, and other agencies]{.underline} as needed.

#### State [controls]{.underline} security cooperation -- all DOD SC is carried out through embassies under [direct]{.underline} supervision of State

Cooperation. SA = Security Assistance. FID = Foreign Internal Defense
assistance**

[Who Conducts Security Cooperation]{.underline}

The following paragraphs describe the key participants and stakeholders
for planning and

managing SC activities at both the strategic, operational, and tactical
levels.

Strategic / National Level

The National Security Council (NSC) generally provides the initial
guidance and translation of national-level decisions pertaining to FID,
SA, and SC. The Department of [State]{.underline} (DoS) [is]{.underline}
generally [the lead]{.underline} government [agency for U.S.
international affairs]{.underline}. The Secretary of State advises the
President in forming foreign policy, including the national FID effort.
The DoS assists the NSC in building national FID related policies and
priorities, and is the lead government agency to carry out these
policies. [The DoS Policy Planning Staff, Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs]{.underline} ([PM)]{.underline}, and the new Bureau of Conflict
and Stabilization Operations (CSO) [are the most involved with
interagency planning for]{.underline} FID, [SA, and SC.]{.underline} The
Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security is
the principal advisor and focal point for SA matters within DoS; control
and coordination of SA extends from this office to the Assistant
Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. At the national
level, the PM is the principal channel of liaison between DoS and DoD.
Generally, [DoS directs the overall U.S. Government]{.underline} (USG)
[SA program and DoD executes via SC programs and
activities]{.underline}.

DoD Directive 5132.03, Policy and Responsibilities Relating to Security
Cooperation, dated October 24, 2008, establishes DoD policy and assigns
responsibilities under the GEF, which provides SC guidance to the GCCs,
and titles 10 and 22 of the United States Code (USC), and statutory
authorities, executive orders, and policies relating to the
administration of SC, including SA programs authorized by the FAA and
AECA, as amended. The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy USD(P)
serves as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of
Defense on all SC matters. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Global
Security Affairs) establishes SA policy and supervises SA programs
through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The Secretaries
of the Military Departments (MILDEPs) coordinate on SC policy guidance,
campaign plans, and allocate resources to achieve SC objectives. The
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) provides implementation
guidance for U.S. military plans and programs and provides the Secretary
of Defense with military advice concerning SC.15

Operational and Tactical Level

The Director, DSCA, under the authority, direction, and control of the
USD(P), directs,

administers, and provides DoD-wide guidance to the DoD Components and
DoD representatives

to U.S. missions, for the execution of DoD SC programs for which DSCA
has responsibility.

Other security SC programs are managed by other Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the

GCCs, or MILDEPs. Specifically, GCCs develop campaign plans to conduct
SC programs and

activities in accordance with the GEF, and complete campaign plan and
campaign support plan

assessments.16

[The U.S. diplomatic mission to a host nation includes representatives
of all U.S. departments and agencies physically present in a
country]{.underline}. [The President gives the Chief of
Mission]{.underline} (COM), normally **[an ambassador]{.underline}**,
[full responsibility for the direction, coordination, and supervision of
**all** USG executive branch employees in country]{.underline}. The COM
has authority over all USG executive branch employees within the mission
and host country except for employees under the command of a U.S.
military commander (Title 22, USC, Section 3927).17 [The Senior Defense
Official]{.underline} (SDO) or Defense Attaché (DATT) [is the principal
DoD official in a U.S. embassy]{.underline}, as designated by the
Secretary of Defense. The SDO or DATT is the COM's principal military
advisor on defense and national security issues, the senior
diplomatically accredited DoD military officer assigned to a diplomatic
mission, and the single point of contact for all DoD matters involving
the embassy or DoD elements assigned to or working from the embassy. In
addition to being the diplomatically accredited DATT, [the SDO is the
chief of the Security Cooperation Organization]{.underline} (SCO)
[within the Country Team. The SCO includes all DoD elements located in a
foreign country with assigned responsibilities for carrying out SA and
SC management functions]{.underline} under titles 22 and 10 USC. SCOs
typically include military assistance advisory groups, military missions
and groups, offices of defense and military cooperation, liaison groups,
and defense attaché personnel designated to perform security
assistance/cooperation functions.18

#### Substantial security cooperation is funded and controlled by State

Lieutenant Colonel Toney **Filostrat and** Lieutenant Colonel Elizabeth
A. **Medina,** United States Army, **12** -- paper written for the
Harvard Kennedy School of Government National Security Fellowship
Program ("SMART TOOLS: Integrating Security Cooperation and Foreign
Assistance in a Period of Constrained Resources"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA568436.pdf> **SC = Security
Cooperation. SA = Security Assistance. FID = Foreign Internal Defense
assistance**

[Significant portions of U.S. military security cooperation are funded
as foreign assistance activities managed by the Department of
State]{.underline}, and appropriated by Congress. With the amount of
funding in the Defense appropriations bills, [it's not common knowledge
that these military programs are funded under DoS budget
authorities]{.underline}. The State Department has always taken its lead
role on foreign assistance seriously, as a significant foreign policy
tool. Over the past ten years, DoS focused on substantial internal
reforms including foreign assistance planning and implementation. The
U.S. government struggles to prepare for a future of persistent conflict
and budget constraints. It is important to solidify reforms and
institutionalize the integrating actions planned in the Quadrennial
Diplomacy and Development Review and the 3D Planning Framework to
implement effective and efficient foreign assistance activities.

### No Solvency\-\--Top-Shelf

#### The Department of State is structurally inept and incapable at effective diplomacy

**Zeya** and Finer **20**, \*American diplomat who has served as the
Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human
Rights in the Biden Administration since July 2021, \*\*American
journalist and diplomat who serves as Deputy National Security Advisor
under National Security Advisor (Uzra and Jon, "Revitalizing the State
Department and American Diplomacy," *Council Special Report* No. 89)//BB

It has become an article of faith among policymakers that principled
American leadership has waned but remains in demand around the world.
Moreover, America's network of international relationships is its
foremost strategic asset, even as the agency charged with advancing U.S.
interests through diplomacy---[the Department of State]{.underline}
(DOS)--- [has fallen into a deep and sustained period of
crisis]{.underline}. However, there is a third framing assumption: that
the current crisis offers an opportunity to address this predicament and
revitalize American diplomacy. Despite the decades-long failure to
implement essential reforms---and even in the face of sustained
hostility from the current administration---diplomacy remains the best
tool the United States has to advance its foreign policy interests. [The
role of the State Department has received heightened attention amid the
onslaught it has suffered under]{.underline} the Donald J.
[Trump]{.underline} administration, [which has treated American
diplomats and diplomacy with a mix of neglect and disdain. But many of
the challenges facing the DOS have existed for **decades**]{.underline}.
[Deficits in diversity, institutional culture, and professionalization
are **endemic** to the State Department as an institution, and a
diminished policy role for career officials persisted under previous
administrations]{.underline}. Too often, leaders from both major parties
have taken public support for U.S. leadership in the world for granted
without making a strong enough case to the American public for why it is
essential. Concrete steps can, and should, be taken solely through
executive action in the first year of an administration committed to
revitalizing American diplomacy, with thought to cementing change
through legislation. [The most pressing challenges facing the State
Department include a twenty-first-century policy environment that has,
in some priority areas, evolved beyond the core competencies of most
Foreign and Civil Service officers and an institution **hollowed out**
by three years of **talent flight**, **mired** in excessively layered
structure, and **resistant to reform**]{.underline}. Perhaps most
important, [they include the multigenerational challenge of a diplomatic
workforce that falls woefully short of reflecting the diverse country it
serves, particularly at the senior-most ranks, compromising its
effectiveness and fostering a homogeneous and risk-averse culture that
drives out rather than cultivates fresh perspectives]{.underline}. [The
State Department today risks losing the "war for talent," not only to
the private sector but increasingly to other government agencies, due to
inflexible career tracks, self-defeating hiring constraints, and a lack
of commitment to training and professional development]{.underline}.
Finally, [DOS is **hampered** by Congress's failure over many years to
pass authorizing legislation, leading to budgetary pressures and
diminishing DOS's status in the hierarchy of national security agencies
rather than reinforcing the nation's paramount foreign policy
institution]{.underline}.

### No Solvency\-\--Risk Aversion/Resources

#### Benghazi created excessive risk aversion

**Hartig 21**, Executive Editor of Just Security. He is also Executive
Director of National Journal\'s Network Science Initiative and Fellow,
International Security Program at New America. Former Senior Director
for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council, former Deputy
Director for Counterterrorism Operations in the Office of the Secretary
of Defense (Luke, "Letting Diplomacy Lead US Counterterrorism: What
Would That Look Like?," Just Security,
<https://www.justsecurity.org/75046/letting-diplomacy-lead-us-counterterrorism-what-would-that-look-like/)//BB>

But [State Department management]{.underline} -- and the broader U.S.
government leadership -- [has]{.underline} at times [**struggled** with
how to effectively manage risk. Much of this is because of the highly
politicized environment the department found itself in after the
September 2012 Benghazi attack in Libya]{.underline}. To be sure,
[**Benghazi** exposed shortcomings]{.underline}, particularly in how the
State Department's security professionals plugged into policy
discussions. But it also spurred much-needed changes to how the
department trains its personnel and evaluates risks overseas. Yet, [as
Republicans used the attacks to launch escalating political attacks, the
U.S. government seemed to **retreat into a bunker
mentality**]{.underline}.

#### That, combined with understaffing, decimates solvency

**David**, Acosta and Krohley **21**, Colonel Arnel P. David is a US
Army strategist assigned to the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. First
Sergeant Sean A. Acosta is a civil affairs noncommissioned officer, and
was the US Army's 2018 NCO of the year. Dr. Nicholas Krohley is the
principal of FrontLine Advisory. ("GETTING COMPETITION WRONG: THE US
MILITARY'S LOOMING FAILURE," *Modern War Institute*,
<https://mwi.usma.edu/getting-competition-wrong-the-us-militarys-looming-failure/>)//BB

At present, [we are engaged in global competition with China
(and]{.underline}, to a much lesser extent, [Russia]{.underline}). We
are engaged in a regional contest with Iran. Global jihadist networks
remain a potent threat. That said, we do ourselves a devastating
disservice when we approach the rest of the world on the basis of its
utility in these contests. American policy in Ukraine is downstream of
our rivalry with Russia. The same is true for our engagement in Iraq
with respect to Iran, and across much of the Global South vis-à-vis
China. We instrumentalize bilateral relationships with smaller powers in
pursuit of advantage against our rivals, while neglecting the local
details that define the strategic landscape. This instrumentalization is
readily apparent to those on the receiving end, provoking cynicism and
frustration from Kyiv to Baghdad and beyond. Ultimately, it is
exploitative and self-defeating---just as it was during the Cold War,
when this same mentality led us to disaster from Vietnam to Nicaragua.
[The new great game will be won or lost based, above all else, on
contextual understanding, partnerships, and alliances]{.underline}. It
is not America's responsibility to solve intractable problems in distant
lands. However, we absolutely must understand said problems (as we have
demonstrably failed to do over the past twenty years), so that we might
manage our entanglements and the expenditure of finite resources.
[Across much of the globe, this task falls to the US
**military**]{.underline}. [The Department of State is **understaffed**,
and **isolated** from ground truth by]{.underline} crippling **[risk
aversion]{.underline}**. The intelligence community's priorities lie
elsewhere. From sub-Saharan Africa to the South China Sea, [the military
is]{.underline} often [our **principal point** of contact with contested
terrain]{.underline}.

#### The military doesn't suffer from the same resource shortages that the State Department does 

**Serafino 8**, Coordinator and International Affairs Specialist at CRS
(Nina, "The Department of Defense Role in Foreign Assistance:
Background, Major Issues, and Options for Congress," Congressional
Research Service, <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA493001.pdf>)//BB

[In addition to its regional advantage, DOD enjoys two other advantages:
**greater planning and execution capabilities**, and substantially
**greater budgetary resources**. DOD can muster more \[hu\]manpower than
any other agency]{.underline}. [While U.S. military personnel may be
stretched in wartime, there still exist substantial reserves of
personnel that can be tapped to plan and carry out activities. The
combatant commands enjoy considerably more personnel than do individual
embassies, and their personnel are oriented toward planning activities,
whereas State Department personnel are oriented toward collecting
information and furthering U.S. policy through diplomacy, such as
person-to-person contact]{.underline}. Despite waging a war in Iraq,
CENTCOM created a new Joint Task Force in the Horn of Africa (CJT-HOA)
of roughly 2,000 U.S. military personnel (the number fluctuates
regularly) to plan and carry out efforts in the Horn of Africa that
include much foreign assistance activity. In Iraq, DOD temporarily
provided military personnel to fill about 100 State Department PRT
posts, until the State Department could contract persons with the needed
expertise to fill them.

### No Solvency\-\--Political Backlash

#### Diplomatic assistance causes [political backlash]{.underline}\-\--that wrecks solvency

**Kralev 20**, Executive Director @ WIDA, The Washington International
Diplomatic Academy (WIDA) is an independent organization that provides
practical professional training in diplomacy and international affairs
--- both in person and online --- to students, recent graduates and
professionals in government, NGOs and the private sector (Nicholas, "Why
Politicians Don't Trust Diplomats," Washington International Diplomatic
Academy,
<https://diplomaticacademy.us/2020/06/14/kralev-why-politicians-dont-trust-diplomats/)//BB>

[So politicians' lack of trust in the Foreign Service is based on
perceptions that are largely divorced from reality]{.underline}. Like
most Americans, [they know very little about our diplomats]{.underline}.
In a challenge to such a conclusion, previous administrations have often
pointed to entrusting a few senior Foreign Service officers, including
William J. Burns and Thomas R. Pickering, with top State Department
posts as an example of the respective president's reliance on
professionals. That may speak of these officers' capabilities, but it
doesn't make up for sidelining or ignoring the service as an
institution. At least Bush and Obama understood that having held a
prominent position under an administration of the other party is also a
part of a career diplomat's job. For example, Bush appointed R. Nicholas
Burns ambassador to NATO and later undersecretary of state, even though
Burns had been State Department spokesman under Clinton. And Obama
appointed Victoria Nuland an assistant secretary of state despite her
earlier role as a close adviser to Dick Cheney, Bush's vice president.
In contrast, Trump has retaliated against officers who held key
positions during the Obama administration. [Politicians' **decades-long
distrust** of the Foreign Service has significantly undermined the
authority of the **professionals and ultimately weakened U.S. diplomacy
globally**]{.underline}. [The very real danger that there won't be
enough properly trained diplomats to **restore America's clout in the
future worries us**]{.underline} at the independent Washington
International Diplomatic Academy. So much so that, although we were set
up to offer short-term courses, we've decided to start a one-year
post-graduate practical training program for people who aspire to become
diplomats --- the first such effort outside government. Our instructors,
all former senior Foreign Service officers, have a lot to teach.

### No Solvency\-\--Trust

#### Military-to-military contacts are necessary to build trust and avoid miscalculation

**Ebitz 19**, graduate of the Federal Bureau of Investigation National
Academy, and holds master's degrees in Military Studies, from the U.S.
Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and Strategic Studies, from the
U.S. Marine Corps War College (Amy, "The use of military diplomacy in
great power competition," Brookings Institute,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/02/12/the-use-of-military-diplomacy-in-great-power-competition/)//BB>

[Within the main elements of national power]{.underline} (diplomacy,
informational, military, and economic, or DIME), [the military is often
considered the last resort. However, the U.S. military has been a **key
player** in, for instance, the **spread of democracy, building partner
countries' strength through military-to-military
relationships**]{.underline} (including in the form of bi- and
trilateral exercises to support standing Operation Plans, NATO, the
United Nations, and Theater Security Cooperation), [personnel exchange,
and humanitarian assistance operations. Through these efforts, among
others, the U.S. military helps to carry out the diplomatic mission of
the United States]{.underline} ([military diplomacy paved the way for
NATO]{.underline}, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization,
[for instance]{.underline}). [When military units participate in
bilateral or multilateral exercises]{.underline} with other countries,
for example, [the purpose is several-fold: The interaction **increases
interoperability** between the militaries, provides for **cultural
exchange and understanding**, and offers an opportunity to expand each
nation's capabilities while exercising potential contingencies. The
importance of military diplomacy in foreign engagement is to **build
dialogue** that may facilitate **further communication and, during a
crisis, avoid confusion between cultures**]{.underline}.

#### The DoD is best for improving strong relationships with host countries

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[Our relationships provide us with a reservoir of strength. They allow
us to operate by, with, and through our allies and partners to meet
shared security challenges]{.underline}. The degree of partnership
should not be measured by the quantity of security cooperation programs,
but rather by their quality. [The Department of Defense has learned from
large-scale assistance programs that for lasting impact, a comprehensive
engagement plan involves more than training and equipping. Importantly,
we are building a culture of **learning and adaptation**, drawing on
lessons from program successes, as well as, from programs that did not
have the desired impact. We are building a learning agenda and
integrating it into decision processes, and measure program impact in a
way that assesses real change, rather than counting our own inputs into
programs as successes in themselves]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} seek
to [learn]{.underline} lessons and avoid the fallacy of sunk costs [by
ruthlessly prioritizing programs that are strategic, and setting
appropriate expectations for programs that provide more of a tactical
advantage. Through this approach, we can unlock the **comparative
advantages our allies and partners** bring as we **collectively work**
together to meet our shared objectives]{.underline}.

#### Military diplomacy builds trust and relations

**Ebitz 19**, graduate of the Federal Bureau of Investigation National
Academy, and holds master's degrees in Military Studies, from the U.S.
Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and Strategic Studies, from the
U.S. Marine Corps War College (Amy, "The use of military diplomacy in
great power competition," Brookings Institute,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/02/12/the-use-of-military-diplomacy-in-great-power-competition/>)//BB

Moreover, [in places where the U.S. military has maintained a long-term
presence]{.underline} (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Germany), [we see that
military interoperability enhances regions economically---directly
through commercial contracting and the resulting employment,
servicemember contributions through commerce, and in some cases,
contributions of military gear and equipment through foreign military
sales or otherwise]{.underline}. [The resulting "military diplomacy,"
also referred to as "defense diplomacy," "**soft power**," "military
public diplomacy," and "strategic communication," allows the military to
have a **direct impact** on foreign policy through other means. Although
not diplomacy in the traditional sense of a State Department mission,
**military relationships between countries build**]{.underline} a
foundation on which [**further connections** between
nations]{.underline} are developed.

### No Solvency\-\--AT Bergmann

#### State Department assistance fails

**Sadler 21**, Senior Fellow for Naval Warfare and Advanced Technology
at Heritage, and Janae Diaz, Fall 2020 member of the Young Leaders
Program at The Heritage Foundation ("Don't Shift Security Cooperation to
State Department," *The Heritage Foundation*,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/dont-shift-security-cooperation-state-department)//BB>

[America spends billions each year on security cooperation and
assistance programs, but the results do not match the
investment]{.underline}. To help improve efficiencies, [the Center for
American Progress recently proposed consolidating **all** these programs
within the State Department]{.underline}. [**That would be a big
mistake**, because it would minimize the Pentagon's role in shaping and
directing security assistance and, ultimately, the program's military
objectives would be subordinated to State Department
interests]{.underline}, such as judicial reform and humanitarian
programs. Those are not the values by which such security assistance
programs should be solely judged. [Security sector assistance programs
deliver arms, military training, and other defense-related services to
allies and partner nation governments]{.underline} via grants, loans,
credit, cash sales, or leasing. [By definition, these programs
**should** prioritize national security. To this end, reforms should
enhance joint State and Defense authorities so programs are evaluated in
terms of America's national strategic goals]{.underline}.

#### Even Bergmann admits structural reforms in the DoS would be necessary for solvency

**1NC Bergmann** and Schmitt **21**, \*senior fellow at the Center for
American Progress, where he focuses on European security and U.S.-Russia
policy. From 2011 to 2017, he served in the U.S. Department of State in
a number of different positions, including as a member of the secretary
of state's policy planning staff, where he focused on political-military
affairs and nonproliferation; special assistant to the undersecretary
for arms control and international security; speechwriter to
then-Secretary of State John Kerry; and senior adviser to the assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs. Prior to serving in
the State Department, he worked at CAP as a military and
nonproliferation policy analyst and at the National Security Network as
the deputy policy director. Bergmann received his master's degree from
the London School of Economics in comparative politics and his
bachelor's degree from Bates College, \*\*senior policy analyst on the
National Security and International Policy team at the Center. She
previously worked on U.S. foreign policy advocacy at Human Rights Watch
and received her Master in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School
(Max and Alexandra, "A Plan To Reform U.S. Security Assistance," *Center
for American Progress*,
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/plan-reform-u-s-security-assistance/)//BB

Moreover, [due to **personnel and resource shortages**, former U.S.
officials found that the State Department is "**not equipped** to
coordinate across the increasingly complex and unwieldy" security
assistance system]{.underline}.80 [Senior policymakers, who often lack
adequate staff or extensive training on security assistance, are not
well equipped to effectively guide the bureaucracy on who should receive
security assistance and how it fits into broader foreign policy
decision-making]{.underline}.81 The State Department's lack of resources
also naturally hampers dual-key provisions that seek to fix coordination
gaps between the State Department and the DOD. This leads to a system
where security assistance policy varies country by country, depending on
the personnel in place and the agency that takes charge. [The added
bureaucracy can make efficient, cost-conscious decisions impossible, and
it opens the process up to political influence]{.underline}.

### AT HR Solvency Deficit

#### The Department of Defense uses Security Cooperation to protect and promote human rights

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[We continue to invest in the professionalization of our security
cooperation workforce by **requiring increasingly rigorous training**.
We are investing in the concept of institutionalizing the defense
diplomacy role the Department's representatives in embassies play,
ensuring that the partnerships they promote are consistent with our
national security interests and values]{.underline}. [What]{.underline}
ultimately [sets apart the United States in an environment of strategic
competition are the values we represent. Our ability to maintain and
continue to **set a high bar for human rights,** humanitarian affairs,
and rule of law---including our civilian oversight of the military---is
a **critical** tool]{.underline} we can leverage to help our partners
meet their goals and advance those shared values. [Doing so is both a
moral and strategic imperative. We also take our responsibility in the
humanitarian sector very seriously, as we play an important supporting
role in the interagency in supporting civil authorities in countries
facing crises]{.underline}. Whether it is managing crisis response
capacity building under the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, Assistance
and Civic Aid (OHDACA) account, employing Foreign Disaster Relief, or
maintaining Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA), the [Department is committed
to supporting our partners' efforts to provide **humanitarian services**
to their civilian populace]{.underline}. [During our recent
reorganization within the Office of the Under Secretary of
Defense]{.underline} (Policy), [we]{.underline} have
[merged]{.underline} the [offices of Stability and Humanitarian Affairs
and Security Cooperation to form a new Office of the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Global Partnerships. This shift **deliberately
integrated humanitarian assistance**, disaster relief, and **human
rights** with the existing processes **related to security cooperation**
to emphasize the centrality of these areas of defense cooperation that
benefit allies and partners in need. Women, Peace and Security; civilian
protection; and respect for the rule of law also fall into this issue
set]{.underline}. [This integration will help us look more holistically
at the needs and challenges our partners and their diverse populations
face]{.underline}, particularly when those needs can spiral into crises

### AT Diplomatic Cred N-B\-\--Non-Unique

#### The military already controls the vast majority of US foreign policy

**Quainton 17**, Distinguished Diplomat in Residence at American
University (Anthony, "Militarization and Marginalization of American
Diplomacy and Foreign Policy," American Diplomacy,
<https://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2018/03/militarization-and-marginalization-of-american-diplomacy-and-foreign-policy/)//BB>

The issue of [militarization of foreign policy is]{.underline} a
**[common]{.underline}** theme. One of the New York Times 100 notable
books of 2016 was Rosa Brooks How Everything became War and the Military
Became Everything. In the spring of 2016 Georgetown University Press
published a collection of essays entitled Mission Creep designed to
explore the Militarization of US Foreign Policy. As far back as 2003
Dana Priest, a journalist for the Washington Post, wrote a book entitled
The Mission which asserted that American diplomacy was being outgunned
by the military and that the United States was becoming increasingly
dependent on the military to manage its role in world affairs. She
claimed that "on (president Bill) Clinton's watch the military slowly,
without public scrutiny or debate came to surpass its civilian leaders
in resources and influence around the world". Specifically she
identified the regional combatant commanders. (In Europe the Supreme
Allied Commander Europe---SACEUR) as sources of increasing diplomatic
influence. In the introduction to her book she assets that "U.S. leaders
have been turning more and more to the military to solve problems that
are often, at their root, political and economic." [This
shift]{.underline} she argues "[has been going on for more than a
decade]{.underline} without much public discussion or debate." Ms.
Priest describes a world in which [four star generals and admirals fly
around the world in large jet aircraft, accompanied by substantial
staffs to engage in diplomatic contacts not just with ministers of
defense and force commanders but with heads of state and government as
well]{.underline}. She asserts that **[they]{.underline}** were
**[eclips]{.underline}**ing [the role of hapless Ambassadors who lacked
both **resources and access**]{.underline}.

### AT Diplomatic Cred N-B\-\--Military Solves

#### Military diplomacy promotes soft power

Academy, and holds master's degrees in Military Studies, from the U.S.
Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and Strategic Studies, from the

great power competition," Brookings Institute,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/02/12/the-use-of-military-diplomacy-in-great-power-competition/)//BB>

[Since military people know better than anyone the true cost of waging
war, the U.S. military has a **vested interest** in working to **build
capabilities and partnerships** to maintain **worldwide peace and
stability**. Although the lines between what are doctrinally military or
diplomatic missions may blur, it is to the advantage of both the State
Department and the military to capitalize on any opportunity to advance
the policy and security of the United States. The military, known as a
hard-power tool, can also be used as a soft-power one. Military members
serving overseas in any capacity are already often the forefront of
American diplomacy, moving their mission set beyond traditional
warfighting]{.underline} to an extended role in support of the National
Security Strategy of the United States, [with great
success]{.underline}. The fact that China is increasingly involved in
regions like Africa and Latin America---giving Beijing influence
there---is further reason for the United States to take a more active
approach and mitigate vulnerabilities. [China has learned from our
greatest strategic achievement, the Marshall Plan, and has formulated a
long-term strategy to, among other things, **undermine U.S. influence**.
We need a coordinated, long-term plan **of military
diplomacy**]{.underline} and economic support [in response]{.underline}.

### AT Diplomatic Cred N-B\-\--Militarization Good

#### [Military-first]{.underline} should be the objective for all security assistance

Program at The Heritage Foundation ("Don't Shift Security Cooperation to
State Department," The Heritage Foundation,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/dont-shift-security-cooperation-state-department)//BB>

[Another report published this month by the Center for a New American
Security rightly suggests that security assistance]{.underline} in the
Middle East [should be guided by strategy and applied narrowly to
military effects]{.underline}. However, the report's recommendations are
limited to counterterrorism activities and a strategy of deprioritizing
the Middle East in favor of the Indo-Pacific. If limiting security
assistance to [**military** **purpose**]{.underline}s would make
programs more effective in a region of waning emphasis, it stands to
reason that this [**should be the formative basis** for all security
assistance programs, especially when strategy calls for increased
investment in the security capacities of partner nations]{.underline}.
[Reforms to security assistance should push the agencies in this
direction, encouraging---or compelling---State to design its programs in
closer **coordination with the Pentagon** and in support of Defense
Department's operational needs, such as improving military forward
presence, wartime resilience and interoperability]{.underline}.

[As the United States looks ahead, the country is sure to follow the
tradition in defense strategy that prioritizes enabling partners through
training and equipping their forces]{.underline}. Over the last 15
years, the number of status of forces agreements (SOFAs) increased from
40 to 117. This is due, in part, to the fact that while administrations
may change, [fundamental U.S. interests]{.underline} have not. These
[include]{.underline}: [protecting the US homeland from catastrophic
attack, sustaining a global system marked by open lines of communication
to facilitate commerce, promoting international security, and preventing
powers hostile to the United States from being able to dominate
important areas of the world]{.underline}.\[4\] [The United States
aspires to create true partners]{.underline} who can confront their own
threats to internal stability, which organized crime, violent actors,
and regional rivals exploit. Known as the "indirect approach," [the U.S.
helps countries fill security deficits that exist when a country cannot
independently protect its own national security]{.underline}. American
generosity helps explain this, but U.S. national security benefits too.
For example, by providing radars and surveillance technology, Central
American countries can control their airspace and can interdict
drug-filled planes bound for the US; by providing logistic support,
Pakistan can lead a maritime coalition promoting maritime security in
the Indian Ocean; and by selling AEGIS destroyers, Japan can counter
North Korean missiles and provide early warning of missile threats to
the United States. [Through **security cooperation**
programs]{.underline} like these, [the United States helps other
countries meet their immediate national security needs, but there is
also an effort to foster independence so states can contribute to global
security]{.underline}. This is most visible in a program such as the
Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiative that trains and equips foreign
militaries to participate in peacekeeping operations. While the United
States does not want to deploy ground forces under the United Nations
flag, it does play a key role in peacekeeping by training and equipping
over 250,000 peacekeepers since 2005. Programs like GPOI enabled
Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda to participate in an African Union
peacekeeping mission in Somalia. An officer from Chad seemed to capture
the rationale for other countries' efforts to contribute to global
security: "[When your neighbor's house is burning, you have to put it
out, because if not, yours is next]{.underline}."\[5\] [U.S. **security
cooperation** often provides the tools countries need when their
national security demands exceed their security capacities]{.underline}.

#### Militarized foreign policy solves a variety of non-military threats

[The preventive and cooperative approach to foreign policy is visible in
today's military]{.underline}, which has undergone dramatic change over
the last three decades. [Defense strategy embraces the notion that the
U.S. military does much more than fight wars]{.underline}. The military
trains, equips, and deploys peacekeepers; provides humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief; and supports other militaries to reduce
security deficits throughout the world. With national security focused
on weak states and regional challengers, [the U.S. military has been
evolving from a **force of confrontation to one of
cooperation**]{.underline}. [The rationale for security cooperation has
been based on the assumption that instability breeds chaos, which would
make it more likely that the US or the international community would
face pressure to intervene in the future]{.underline}. Given America's
global foreign policy, [many countries have large expectations for
assistance from the United States, but the US also derives benefits from
security cooperation. Among these are]{.underline}: Obtaining base
access as a quid pro quo Augmenting U.S. force structure by providing
logistics and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support to
coalition partners in the Middle East Promoting a favorable balance of
power by selling weapon systems and training programs to Gulf
Cooperation Council countries to balance Iran [Harmonizing areas of
cooperation]{.underline} by working with Japan and Israel on missile
defense Promoting self-defense through the Georgia Train and Equip
program [Reinforcing sovereignty]{.underline} through programs like Plan
Colombia and the Merida Initiative with Mexico Supporting the US
industrial base and creating interoperable air forces through the F-35
program As these reasons suggest, [security cooperation is much bigger
than train and equip forces in combat zones]{.underline}. Given the
scope of these programs and diversity of the partners, one can develop
[measurable objectives]{.underline}. These [include]{.underline}: the
strength of regional security agreements, the types of regional
cooperation (e.g., participation in U.S.-led air, maritime, or land
operations), willingness of foreign governments to counter threats the
U.S. identifies (e.g. terrorism), and the relative receptivity of U.S.
forces within the partner country. Internal to countries, one can
measure how well partners combat security challenges, the strength of
civil--military relations, and the levels of respect for human rights.
Measurement can include [the extent to which international commerce
flows freely, levels of cooperation between **military** and
international relief organizations, and support for international
initiatives to combat disease, illicit activity, and weapons
proliferation]{.underline}.

### AT Democracy Impact

#### Democracy's [net less peaceful]{.underline}\-\--they have [no advantage]{.underline} over autocracies but have a [propensity to go to war]{.underline} with autocracies.

**Bakker '17** (Femke; is an assistant professor at the Institute of
Political Science @ University of Leiden; *Do liberal norms matter? A
cross-regime experimental investigation of the normative explanation of
the democratic peace in China and the Netherlands*;
[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/74424/Bakker_2017.pdf?sequence=1](about:blank);
accessed 7/21/19; MSCOTT)

Concluding discussion

Democratic peace theory posits that individuals of liberal-democracies
are socialized with liberal norms that nurture a peaceful attitude
towards other democracies. Furthermore, it postulates that individuals
in autocracies lack this socialization process and will consequently be
more war prone towards all regime-types. Previous studies into this
mechanism at microlevel found that democratic individuals are indeed
more peaceful towards democracies during an interstate conflict.
However, [these studies have focused their research on democratic
individuals only, and moreover have assumed the presence of liberal
norms rather than measuring these]{.underline}. This research extends to
those studies by measuring the level of liberal norms among democratic
and autocratic individuals and compare the effect these norms have on
the support for war within an experimental setting.

Indeed, [the democratic experimental group showed to be more peaceful
towards other democracies, just like previous studies
showed]{.underline}. However, the comparative perspective brought a new
insight: [because the autocratic citizens were overall more peaceful
towards all regime-types the comparison showed that actually
the]{.underline} **[democratic participants were not more peaceful
towards other democracies, but rather more war-prone towards
autocracies]{.underline}**. [These 22 findings are important in the
light of theoretical refinement, and show that we cannot simply assume
autocratic individuals to be war prone, as democratic peace theory
does]{.underline} (Maoz and Russett 1993, Russett 1993, p.35, Weart
1998, pp.81-83, Rousseau 2005, pp.27-28).

[Secondly, the measuring of liberal norms showed that also **autocratic
individuals posses a level of liberal norms**]{.underline}. [The average
of the autocratic group was indeed significantly lower than the
democratic group, but the difference was small and had a small effect
size]{.underline}. Most important contribution of this measurement is
that **[liberal norms cannot be assumed to be absent within autocracies,
as democratic peace theory does]{.underline}**. Moreover, [liberal norms
showed to have only an effect within the democratic group: **those with
a higher level of liberal norms were more inclined to attack an
autocracy over a democracy**]{.underline}. Within the autocratic group,
the level of liberal norms did not have any influence on the support for
war.

[These results show how important it is to indeed measure liberal norms
and not simply assume these to be present or absent]{.underline}.
Furthermore, these finding raise many questions that further research
might be inspired by. If these results would hold when the experiment
would be replicated for different samples of democratic and autocratic
individuals, in other words: if democratic individuals show in new
studies also to be triggered by autocracy to become more war prone, in
particular when they endorse liberal norms more highly, we might have
found more evidence for the argument that Western political rhetoric has
molded democratic peace theory into a self-fulfilling prophecy, as was
argued by several authors (Ish-Shalom 2006, Risse-Kappen 1995, Houghton
2007, Houghton 2009).

Another important extension to earlier studies is that this research has
controlled for the threat of the conflict, after all, if a threat is not
perceived as severe, why would anyone want to attack any other country?
[The results of that test showed actually more variance than initially
anticipated, in other words: it had to be considered within the analyses
of the data]{.underline}. Because a test showed that **[there was no
relation between the perception of threat and the treatment of
regime-type]{.underline}**, [perception of threat was taken into
consideration as an independent variable. And **threat
matters**]{.underline}, [strongly]{.underline}. Within a multivariate
test of all theorized indicators, [perception of threat shows to be the
**most important indicator** why democratic and autocratic individuals
alike support war.]{.underline} [It was actually so strong that the
effect of regime-type and liberal norms that showed in the descriptive
results, was **faded out**]{.underline}.

### AT Hegemony Impact

#### No leadership impact. 

**Fettweis 20**, Associate Professor of Political Science at Tulane
University. (Christopher J., 6-3-2020, \"Delusions of Danger:
Geopolitical Fear and Indispensability in U.S. Foreign Policy\", *A
Dangerous World? Threat Perception and U.S. National Security*,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/publications/delusions-danger-geopolitical-fear-indispensability-us-foreign-policy>)

Like many believers, [proponents of hegemonic stability theory base
their view on **faith alone**]{.underline}.41 [There is **precious
little evidence** to suggest that the United States is responsible
for]{.underline} the [pacific trends]{.underline} that have swept across
the system. In fact, [the world remained **equally
peaceful**]{.underline}, relatively speaking, [while the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [cut its forces throughout the
1990s, as well as while it **doubled** its military spending in the
first decade of the new century]{.underline}.42 **[Complex statistical
methods]{.underline}** should not be needed to [demonstrate that levels
of U.S. military spending have been essentially **unrelated** to global
stability.]{.underline}

Hegemonic stability theory's flaws go way beyond the absence of simple
correlations to support them, however. [The theory's supporters have
**never been able to explain adequately** how precisely **5 percent** of
the world's population could **force** peace on the other **95
percent**]{.underline}, unless, of course, the rest of the world was
simply not intent on fighting. [Most states are quite free to go to war
without U.S. involvement but **choose not to**]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can be counted on, especially
after Iraq, to **steer well clear** of most civil wars and ethnic
conflicts]{.underline}. It took years, hundreds of thousands of
casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited
interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal [violence
in]{.underline}, say, [most of Africa would be unlikely to attract
serious attention of the world's policeman, much less
**intervention**]{.underline}. [The continent is, **nevertheless**,
**more peaceful today** than at **any other time** in its
history]{.underline}, [something for which U.S. hegemony **cannot take
credit**]{.underline}.43 [Stability exists today in **many such places**
to which U.S. hegemony **simply does not extend**.]{.underline}

Overall, [proponents of the **stabilizing power** of U.S. hegemony
should keep in mind one of the most **basic observations** from
**cognitive psychology**]{.underline}: [**rarely** are our actions as
important to others' calculations as we **perceive them to
be**]{.underline}.44 [The]{.underline} so‐​called **[egocentric
bias]{.underline}**, which is essentially ubiquitous in human
interaction, [suggests that although it may be **natural** for U.S.
policymakers to interpret their role as crucial in the maintenance of
world peace, they are **almost certainly overestimating their own
importance**]{.underline}. [Washington is probably not as central to the
**myriad decisions** in foreign capitals that help maintain
international stability as it thinks it is.]{.underline}

[The **indispensability fallacy** owes its existence to a couple of
factors]{.underline}. First, [although all people like to **bask** in
the **reflected glory** of their country's]{.underline} (or culture's)
**[unique, nonpareil stature]{.underline}**, [Americans have long been
**exceptional** in their **exceptionalism**]{.underline}.45 [The short
history of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which can
easily be read as an almost uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story
of success, [has led to a]{.underline} (perhaps natural) [belief that it
is **morally, culturally**, and **politically superior** to other,
lesser countries]{.underline}. It is no coincidence that the exceptional
state would be called on by fate to maintain peace and justice in the
world.

[Americans have always combined that feeling of **divine providence**
with a sense of mission to spread their ideals around the world and
**battle evil**]{.underline} wherever it lurks. It is that sense of
destiny, of being the object of history's call, that most obviously
separates the United States from other countries. Only an American
president would claim that by entering World War I, "America had the
infinite privilege of fulfilling her destiny and saving the world."46

Although many states are motivated by humanitarian causes, no other
seems to consider promoting its values to be a national duty in quite
the same way that Americans do. "I believe that God wants everybody to
be free," said George W. Bush in 2004. "That's what I believe. And
that's one part of my foreign policy."47 When Madeleine Albright called
the United States the "indispensable nation," she was reflecting a
traditional, deeply held belief of the American people.48 Exceptional
nations, like exceptional people, have an obligation to assist the
merely average.

Many of the factors that contribute to geopolitical fear ---
Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested interests, and neoconservatism
--- also help explain American exceptionalism and the indispensability
fallacy. And unipolarity makes hegemonic delusions possible. With the
great power of the United States comes a sense of great responsibility:
to serve and protect humanity, to drive history in positive directions.
More than any other single factor, the people of the United States tend
to believe that they are indispensable because they are powerful, and
power tends to blind states to their limitations. "Wealth shapes our
international behavior and our image," observed Derek Leebaert. "It
brings with it the freedom to make wide‐​ranging choices well beyond
common sense."49 [It is quite likely that the world **does not need the
U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to enforce
peace]{.underline}**. In fact, [if **virtually any** of the overlapping
and mutually reinforcing explanations for the current stability are
correct, the trends in international security may well prove **difficult
to reverse**]{.underline}. [**None** of the **contributing factors**
that are commonly suggested]{.underline} ([**economic development**,
complex **interdependence**, **nuclear weapons**, international
**institutions**, **democracy**, **shifting global norms** on
war]{.underline}) [seem **poised to disappear** any time
soon]{.underline}.50 [The world will probably **continue**]{.underline}
its [peace]{.underline}ful ways for the near future, at the very least,
[**no matter what** the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[chooses to do or not do]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis concluded while
pondering the likely effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made in
foreign capitals, "It is very unlikely that pulling off the American
security blanket would lead to thoughts of war."51 The United States
will remain fundamentally safe no matter what it does --- in other
words, despite widespread beliefs in its inherent indispensability to
the contrary.

#### Heg is [unsustainable]{.underline}\-\--retrenchment is [gradual]{.underline} now, but recommitting makes it [violent]{.underline} and [forced]{.underline}.

Who Is President\", *Foreign Policy*,

[As the Trump era]{.underline} potentially [comes to an end,
many]{.underline} foreign-policy voices in the United States and abroad
**[relish]{.underline}** [the prospect of the country's **roaring
return**]{.underline} [to the global stage. But attempting a **full-on
comeback** would be a **mistake. If anything**]{.underline}, [the
**strategic pullback**]{.underline} [that]{.underline} President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** [has initiated **needs to
continue**]{.underline}---albeit in a more coherent and judicious
manner.

Much of the debate surrounding the next administration's foreign policy
has focused on boldly reasserting U.S. leadership in the world. And it's
true: Global interdependence and upheaval do require steady U.S.
leadership and engagement. [What's been]{.underline} largely
**[missing]{.underline}** from this debate, however, [are the challenges
facing the next president when it comes to **right-sizing U.S.
engagement abroad**]{.underline}---[especially **military
involvement**]{.underline}---[and bringing the nation's **strategic
commitments** back into line with it **means** and
**purposes**.]{.underline}

[The American electorate has turned **sharply inward**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [response to **military overreach** in the **Middle
East**]{.underline}, [the **economic dislocations**]{.underline}
[brought about by **innovation** and **globalization**]{.underline},
[and the **national calamity** caused by **COVID**]{.underline}-19. [The
nation's **next president** would]{.underline} be wise to take
note---and [craft a brand of global statecraft that is **effective** but
also]{.underline} politically **[sustainable]{.underline}**. [Otherwise,
the **strategic pullback** that needs to take place will occur **by
default rather than by design**]{.underline}, [risking]{.underline} that
**[U.S. overreach]{.underline}** could turn into even more dangerous
underreach. Indeed, that's what's been happening during Trump's
presidency. He seems to have understood the need to retrench. But his
troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Germany have been
haphazard, making a hash of the effort. Retrenchment cannot be done by
tweet, in unpredictable fits and starts, and couched in an abrasive
"America first" unilateralism that has alienated allies and set the
world on edge.

Democratic candidate Joe [**Biden** is]{.underline} far better [suited
to restore an **equilibrium**]{.underline} [between]{.underline} the
nation's [**foreign policy** and]{.underline} its **[political
will]{.underline}**. [Throughout his career, he has been a **pragmatic**
and **prudent internationalist**]{.underline}; [looking forward,
pragmatism and prudence will require a more **selective** and
**discriminating internationalism**]{.underline}, **[not]{.underline}**
**[restoration of the s]{.underline}**tatus **[quo]{.underline}** ante.
Three-quarters of the American public want U.S. troops to leave
Afghanistan and Iraq---[it is time to downsize the U.S. footprint in the
Middle East. U.S. foreign policy has become
**over-militarized**]{.underline}---[the next administration should
**reallocate priorities** and **resources**]{.underline}, [putting more
emphasis on **diplomacy**]{.underline}, cybersecurity, global public
health, and climate change. Washington should also return to being a
team player if it is to lighten its load; [**retrenchment** and
**multilateral engagement** go hand in hand. Meeting the threat posed by
**China**]{.underline}, managing international **[trade]{.underline}**
and finance, [preventing]{.underline} nuclear
**[prolif]{.underline}**eration, [addressing]{.underline}
**[pandemics]{.underline}**---[these]{.underline} and other urgent
challenges [all require broad **international
coop**eration]{.underline}. [And as the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[pulls back]{.underline}** from its role as
global policeman, [it will want **like-minded partners** to help **fill
the gap**]{.underline}. These partnerships become stronger through
diplomacy and teamwork.

[The **top priorities** of the next president will be **at home**:
**taming the pandemic**, **repairing the economy**, and reviving
**democratic institutions**]{.underline} and norms. Only if the
country's democratic lights come back on can it effectively deal with
the rest of the world. In the meantime, [the next
admin]{.underline}istration [needs to **continue Trump's effort** to
**downsize** the nation's foreign **entanglements**]{.underline}---but
[in a **smart** and **measured** way]{.underline}. The United States
needs to step back without stepping away. "Build back better" applies
abroad just as much as it does at home.
