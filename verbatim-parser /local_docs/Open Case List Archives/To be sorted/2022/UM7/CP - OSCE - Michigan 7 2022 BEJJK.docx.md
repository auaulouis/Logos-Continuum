#### OSCE solves -- they can regulate new emerging technologies 

**Liechtenstein 19** \[Stephanie Liechtenstein, 03-25-2019, "Regulating
new military technologies," Security and Human Rights Monitor,

New technologies have reached the military realm and their possible
impact is beginning to cause a headache for governments and military
experts alike. Discussions are currently focused on four areas: lethal
autonomous weapons, or so-called 'killer robots', biotechnologies, cyber
weapons, and new missile technology.

[For most of these technologies, there are no international rules in
place.]{.underline}

This comes amid a general crisis of the international arms control
regime, caused by the U.S. withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the potential ramifications this could
have on the extension of the New START Treaty, which expires in 2021.
Some experts already speak of a complete breakdown of the arms control
regime and warn of a general militarization of international relations.

"We must find solutions for the technological challenges of tomorrow. In
a nutshell, we must rethink arms control," German Foreign Minister Heiko
Maas said in his opening speech of a high-level arms control conference
at the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin on 15 March, bringing together
450 diplomats and experts.

By hosting this conference, Germany is at the forefront of an initiative
to discuss the impact of new technologies on future warfare and on arms
control. "We are of the opinion that a new start can only succeed if we
work side by side -- parliamentarians and government representatives, as
well as think tanks, researchers, military experts and industry
representatives," Maas said in Berlin.

Margot Wallström, the Swedish Foreign Minister, and Stef Blok, the
Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, came to Berlin to support Germany
in this endeavour. The three foreign ministers issued a joint
declaration in which they stressed the "utmost importance that we now
analyse closely potential negative and positive effects of new
technologies, and identify the need for further regulation and new arms
control arrangements in order to maintain international peace and
stability".

Killer robots

[One major issue of concern are lethal autonomous weapons (or killer
robots) that attack targets without human intervention.]{.underline}
Such weapons systems are particularly prone to manipulation and
miscalculation, thus increasing the risk of accidental wars. One example
are kamikaze drones that attack targets without a human taking the
decision.

Ethical considerations are also a major issue of concern, as there are
currently no rules who can be held responsible for an act of aggression
if there is no human decision or control behind. This point was also
underlined in a study by the German Institute for International and
Security Affairs, presented on the margins of the conference: "From an
ethical perspective, lethal autonomous weapons systems are particularly
problematic with regard to human dignity, because robots do not
understand what it means to kill a human being".

[Discussions are currently ongoing at the United Nations in Geneva
within an expert group, with Germany and France hoping to make tangible
progress.]{.underline} "We are committed to this in Geneva right now,
and we want to make progress here this year. We want to enshrine the
principle of effective human control over all lethal weapons systems at
the international level, thereby taking a major step towards the global
prohibition of fully autonomous weapons," Maas emphasised in his opening
speech in Berlin.

Germany and France are faced with two additional groups of states in
Geneva. "One group of 28 states, among them Austria, wants an immediate
ban for all autonomous weapons systems, agreed in an international
treaty. Another group of states is opposed to this, among them the U.S.,
Russia, Israel and Australia, as they prefer to continue developing such
systems," explains Dr. Frank Sauer, senior researcher at the Bundeswehr
University Munich.

Biotechnologies

[Biological weapons as such are not new, however new technologies make
them more dangerous.]{.underline} According to a report published by the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on the occasion
of the Berlin conference, "the convergence of developments in
biotechnology with other, emerging technologies such as additive
manufacturing \[3-D printing\], artificial intelligence and robotics has
increased the possibilities for the development and use of biological
weapons".

"Each of these technologies could, in its own way, facilitate the
development, production and use of biological weapons, and make them
more dangerous," said Kolja Brockmann, Researcher at SIPRI and lead
author of the report.

"The increased use of robots in laboratories could lead to significant
gains in productivity during the design-build-test cycle of biological
weapons, while artificial intelligence could be used to find new ways to
optimize the transmissibility or virulence of a biological agent," Dr.
Vincent Boulanin, Senior Researcher at SIPRI on emerging technologies,
added.

The 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, the main treaty
governing biological arms control, is "ill-equipped to comprehensively
address these risks", experts from SIPRI warn in the report.

Governments are particularly concerned about the misuse of biological
weapons by terrorists and other non-state actors. German Foreign
Minister Heiko Maas therefore announced in Berlin that "the Federal
Government will therefore work to establish a permanent body of experts
and scientists under the umbrella of the Biological Weapons Convention
-- one that clearly identifies risks and informs and advises states as
to them".

Cyber weapons

[Rapid developments in the cyber sector have also reached the military
realm. Cyber warfare is already happening, with states or non-state
actors attacking another state's IT infrastructure, or other important
infrastructure such as banking system, through the use of computer
viruses or other malware.]{.underline}

"Identifying the responsible party behind malicious cyber incidents is a
necessary prerequisite for holding these actors accountable, but there
are many challenges that accompany cyber attribution," experts from the
RAND corporation stated in January.

Foreign Minister Maas called for "universal behavioural norms and
standards in cyberspace" in his speech and also made reference to
efforts within the OSCE, the only international organisation that has
agreed on politically-binding confidence-building measures for the cyber
space.

Hypersonic missiles

New technologies have also found their way into missile systems. One of
the main concerns here are hypersonic missiles, capable of flight at
speeds of Mach 5 and above as they leave very little time for humans to
react.

"The fact that we're not just talking about science fiction here is
demonstrated by Russia's announcement that the first Avangard systems
will be entering service this year," Foreign Minister Maas said in
Berlin.

As worldwide concern is growing about these new developments, Maas
seized the opportunity of the conference in Berlin "to establish an
international missiles dialogue that takes into account both the
challenges posed by new technologies and the dangers of their
proliferation".

[A **role for the OSCE?**]{.underline}

[Arms control remains an important part of the **global security
architecture.** The expert conference in Berlin showed that the arms
control regime needs to evolve to adapt to changes not only in the
political and strategic spheres, but also taking into account rapid
technological changes.]{.underline}

[**The OSCE,** as a regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of
the Charter of the United Nations, could be used in **this endeavour as
a platform to exchange information on new** military **technologies**
and thus build confidence and increase transparency and predictability.
The regular military doctrines seminars could be a first starting
point.]{.underline}

#### Counterplan revitalizes OSCE effectiveness by refocusing the organizations and legitimizing its approach

the State of the Field, Article 9\]\\\\pairie

The Path Forward: Building Cooperative Capacity for Atrocity Prevention
[In an October 2016 interview, OSCE General Secretary Lamberto Zannier
observed that "the OSCE as a security organization is facing a very
complicated environment," because of the "return of geopolitics"
involving "divisions in Europe that we haven't seen in a long time,"
aggravated by global challenges including terrorism along with migration
stemming from violent conflicts and the effects of climate
change]{.underline}. Zannier observed: As the OSCE was built in a
divided environment to bridge the gulf between opposing sides, today the
[convergence of all these problems is **eroding the effectiveness** of
the tools that were created at that time.]{.underline} So [we are facing
a situation where we may have more division, and the tools that we
developed to address the problems coming with the divisions are not
functioning... as well as they were. So engagement, creating a space of
dialogue in spite of the differences and the bitter debates... remains
the key task for all of us.]{.underline}42 In the bitter aftermath of
the 2016 presidential election in the United States, where the Russian
intelligence services allegedly sought to undermine the campaign of
Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in order to tip the result to
Republican candidate Donald Trump, such constructive dialogue has become
more challenging than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Having
long complained of Western meddling in Russia's "near abroad" through
democracy promotion initiatives and support for the "Color Revolutions,"
the Putin regime has effectively turned the tables on its Western
counterparts. Russia is alleged to have "cultivated an opaque web of
economic and political patronage" throughout much of Central and Eastern
Europe,43 as well as to have forged connections with right-wing parties
in Western Europe including the UKIP in Britain and the National Front
in France.44 The heated accusations of ill will on both sides have
further narrowed the already constricted avenues for cooperation between
the OSCE's Eastern and Western participating States. As one scholar has
written, the OSCE is "par excellence, a 'soft security' institution with
extremely few material resources at its disposal." Unlike other regional
organizations such as the EU and NATO, the OSCE cannot exercise coercive
power by imposing economic sanctions or threatening the use of military
force. Nor, in the current geopolitical environment, can it credibly
offer material rewards such as the prospect of EU membership, which
served as a powerful incentive for cooperation by the Baltic governments
in the 1990s. [The effectiveness of the OSCE depends on its ability to
"use its moral authority as a principled organization and its limited
amount of cultural capital (e.g. technical expertise) to exercise
symbolic power."45]{.underline} In the current polarized international
security environment in Eurasia, it is increasingly difficult for the
OSCE to assert universally recognized moral authority. During the 1970s
and 1980s, the CSCE took shape as a dialogue process between NATO and
the Warsaw Pact in a period of high international tension and distrust,
which eased temporarily during the decade after the fall of the Berlin
Wall. To some degree, the rising frictions between the Russian
Federation and its Western counterparts have returned Europe full circle
to the geopolitical atmosphere that surrounded the CSCE's founding. Even
in an inhospitable geopolitical context, the OSCE can make several
valuable contributions to protecting civilians threatened by violent
conflict in Eurasia: conflict prevention, crisis management, cooperative
problem-solving, and the promotion of norms favoring peaceful
coexistence of diverse ethnic and national groups. The remainder of this
essay will address each of these aspects of the OSCE's work in turn.
Conflict Prevention. During the recent period of rising tensions between
the Eastern and Western factions of the OSCE, a number of efforts have
been made to bridge this geopolitical divide and develop more
constructive strategies for mitigating threats of violent conflict. In
2008, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy called for a new European security dialogue to discuss post-Cold
War security arrangements.46 In 2009, the Greek Chairmanship of the OSCE
launched a series of dialogues known as the "Corfu Process," which
sought "to strengthen the Organization's responsiveness to conflict in
all its phases," including "early warning, early action, dialogue
facilitation and mediation support, and postconflict rehabilitation."47
These dialogues culminated in 2011, under the OSCE's Lithuanian
Chairmanship, in Ministerial Decision No. 3/11 on Elements of the
Conflict Cycle, which affirmed "the Organization's commitment to
revisiting its approaches to conflict prevention and conflict resolution
for the twenty-first century."48 Among other things, Ministerial
Decision No. 3/11 called for the establishment of a systematic conflict
early warning system and a more robust mediationsupport capacity.
Unfortunately, there has been limited practical follow-through on many
of its recommendations.49 Crisis Management. Some of the most
intractable conflicts in the OSCE region---e.g. those in Ukraine, the
South Caucasus, Moldova, and Nagorno-Karabakh---are located in areas on
the periphery of the Russian Federation where Russia has a strong vested
interest in the outcome. Given the OSCE's lack of material instruments
of leverage, the organization is unlikely to be able to successfully
mediate such conflicts that have become locked into a "security
competition" frame. Nonetheless, it can help contain violence by
focusing international attention on events in the conflict zones,
monitoring developments, and providing early warning of potential
escalation. The presence of an OSCE field mission or visits by the HCNM
may also provide channels of communication between leaders of rival
groups, which may help keep a lid on violence even in the absence of a
formal settlement. In Ukraine, for example, the OSCE Special Monitoring
Mission (SMM) has tracked the living conditions of the 1.8 million IDPs
from Crimea and Eastern Ukraine since 2014, offering recommendations for
how the government of Ukraine and international donors can meet the
needs of IDPs and enhance relations between IDPs and host communities.50
The SMM issues daily spot reports on security conditions in Eastern
Ukraine, monitoring compliance with the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and
"engages with authorities at all levels, as well as civil society,
ethnic and religious groups and local communities to facilitate dialogue
on the ground."51 Astrid Thors, who served as High Commissioner on
National Minorities from 2013 through 2016, also engaged in efforts to
"facilitate a dialogue between national minorities and the Ukrainian
authorities on issues of common concern." For example, she co-hosted a
2016 roundtable in Kyiv on "Strengthening the Institutional Framework
Related to Inter-ethnic Relations in Ukraine in the Context of
Decentralization." Asserting that "improved policies in the field of
inter-ethnic relations would help to consolidate Ukrainian society and
would increase stability in the country as a whole," the HCNM has worked
to provide a platform for Russian and other minority communities in
Ukraine to express concerns about the protection of their language and
cultural identities.52 In less geopolitically sensitive regions, such as
Central Asia and the Balkan states, the OSCE may have greater potential
for robust conflict prevention and crisis response---but its record in
achieving this potential has been uneven. For example, in May and June
2010, HCNM Knut Vollebaek issued urgent warnings to the OSCE Permanent
Council on the risk of interethnic violence in Kyrgyzstan, asserting
that the situation represented "one of the OSCE's biggest challenges
since the 2008 war in the Caucasus."53 When violence between ethnic
Kyrgyz and Uzbeks erupted in southern Kyrgyzstan that June, however, the
OSCE Permanent Council displayed no appetite for a robust response. In
the words of one commentator, "The lack of collective will by the
participating States and the Kyrgyz interim government's inability to
take substantial steps in managing the conflict in Kyrgyzstan
significantly curbed the OSCE's room for maneuver."54 Cooperative
Problem-Solving. Even in geopolitically contested settings where a
comprehensive settlement remains elusive, the OSCE may be able to
promote incremental progress toward peaceful coexistence of rival
groups. For example, in Georgia, where the OSCE field mission was closed
down on Russia's insistence in 2008, the HCNM has "encouraged the
effective implementation of the State Strategy for Civic Equality and
Integration for 2015-2020 and Its Action Plan," and has "continued to
support a project to facilitate interaction between the political
parties in the country and national minority representatives, including
by bringing them together to discuss topical issues on televised talk
shows."55 In Moldova, High Commissioner Thors worked with the parliament
to establish a "joint working group with members of parliament and the
People's Assembly of Gagauzia" to improve "the functioning of the Gagauz
autonomy," and she has worked with the OSCE Mission to Moldova to
address cultural and linguistic issues surrounding the status of
Transdniestria.56 Thors also remained engaged in addressing issues
related to citizenship rights, political representation of ethnic
minorities, and protection of minority languages in a wide range of
other countries including Kyrgyzstan, Croatia, Serbia,
Bosnia-Hezegovina, Macedonia, Hungary, and Slovakia.57 [**Norm
Promotion**. Over the past twenty years, the OSCE has issued a number of
statements of principles regarding the protection of minority rights,
including the Hague Recommendations Regarding the Education Rights of
National Minorities (1996), the Bolzano/Bozen Recommendations on
National Minorities in Inter-State Relations (2008), and the Ljubljana
Guidelines on Integration of Diverse Societies (2012).]{.underline}58 In
documents such as the Charter for European Security, adopted at the
Istanbul summit of 1999, it has also reaffirmed its commitment to
"preventing the outbreak of violent conflicts wherever possible" and "to
settle conflicts and to rehabilitate societies ravaged by war and
destruction."59 Beyond affirming these principles related to human
security, the OSCE has sought to memorialize its operational approach to
conflict prevention in documents including "The OSCE Concept of
Comprehensive and Co-operative Security" (2009) and the Ministerial
Decision No. 3/11 on Elements of the Conflict Cycle (2011).60 Scholars
disagree about the efficacy of the OSCE's efforts to transform norms
governing relations among diverse ethnic groups in Eurasia. Some
observers, such as Wolfgang Zellner, have argued that the HCNM has been
relatively successful in "de-securitizing" relationships between states
and minority groups by "introducing international minority rights
standards as the frame of reference for majority, minority and
kin-States." The HCNM, Zellner asserts, has facilitated "substantive
short-term solutions with a view towards sustainable long-term solutions
under local ownership."61 Others have taken a more skeptical view: David
Galbreath and Joanne McEvoy contend that "the HCNM's role in societal
security often appears to maintain the status quo 'state vs. minority'
logic of the European minority rights regime," and that the OSCE as a
whole has been unable to transform the "zero-sum context" of interethnic
relations in Eurasia.62 [Despite the sometimes disappointing results of
its conflict prevention and crisis management initiatives, the OSCE
remains a vital component of the **Eurasian security architecture,**
both because of its inclusive membership structure and because of its
core mission to advance "common and comprehensive security" through a
**consensus-based approach**.]{.underline} Yet, for the organization to
play a robust role in addressing the urgent security challenges in
contemporary Eurasia, it is essential that its participating States
share a genuine consensus about the importance of protecting civilians
threatened by violent conflict. One stumbling block to productive
cooperation between the Eastern and Western participating States of the
OSCE has been mutual suspicion over the other side's motives. In
Zellner's words, "what the U.S. regards as democratization, Russia takes
as destabilization."63 As Alistair Miskimmon and Ben O'Loughlin have
observed, a profound misalignment has emerged between Russian and
Western narratives about the post-Cold War order. Rather than being
recognized as "co-constitutor of this emerging system," since the early
1990s "Russia has complained of being excluded from the major decisions
affecting it." Consequently, Russia "feels mis-recognized," driving a
"cycle of miscommunication, generating frustration on all sides and
restricting the scope for cooperation."64 During the 1970s and 1980s,
the CSCE explicitly avoided establishing a democratization agenda, which
the Western participating States recognized as a bridge too far for
their Soviet counterparts. Instead, participants in the Helsinki
dialogue process focused on promotion of human rights and other aspects
of the "human dimension" of security, in an effort to build mutual trust
and lay a foundation for a broader range of security cooperation
activities. [In the current period of retrenchment in relations between
NATO and the Russian Federation, it is essential for the OSCE to seek
areas of common ground that can serve as a focal point for constructive
engagement. A narrowing and deepening of the OSCE's **mission,
refocusing on the objectives of promoting human security** in regions
afflicted by conflict, might help rebuild the normative consensus
between Eastern and Western participating States and increase the OSCE's
operational effectiveness.]{.underline}

#### OSCE effectiveness is key to preventing escalating tensions that go existential -- Moldova, Georgia and Central Asia

**Vartanyan & Lanz 22** \[Olesya Vartanyan & David Lanz, 03-21-2022,
"Preserving the OSCE at a time of war," \<\<Olesya is Crisis Group's
Senior Analyst\>\>, \<\<David is the Representative for Dialogue
Promotion\>\>, OCHA Services,
[https://reliefweb.int/report/world/preserving-osce-time-war\]\\\\pairie](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/preserving-osce-time-war%5d\\pairie)

But for all the challenges it faces, the OSCE remains an essential
forum. It is one of the only remaining multilateral spaces outside the
UN for dialogue between Russia and the West; in the words of an OSCE
official, the organisation has been "sort of an airbag that opens any
time we face echoes of tensions" between Russia and the West. [The OSCE
is]{.underline} one of [the]{.underline} few [international
organisations with the potential to play an important role in
implementing any ceasefire arrangement that the conflict parties might
reach in Ukraine]{.underline}, where prior to the war's current phase it
led a sizeable monitoring mission. [It also helps **manage the risk of
escalation** in conflicts from **Moldova to Georgia to Central
Asia.**]{.underline}

[Governments should do all they can to prevent the OSCE's
incapacitation]{.underline}. Russia must refrain from holding the OSCE
hostage and letting core operations collapse. Western states, in turn,
should resist pushing for Russia's suspension from the OSCE. Suspension
would likely lead Russia to withdraw, as it did on 15 March from the
Council of Europe.

The OSCE in Ukraine

With roots that date back to the 1970s, the OSCE assumed its current
institutional form in 1994 as a forum for peace, stability and democracy
issues. It runs fifteen field operations that perform a range of tasks,
from monitoring conflict situations and violence prevention to promoting
governance reform.

Even before recent events, Ukraine was an important theatre for the
OSCE. In 2014, following Russia's annexation of Crimea and the onset of
a Russia-backed separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, the OSCE
mounted a far-reaching response. It deployed a monitoring mission -- one
of the largest field operations in its history -- that served as eyes
and ears on the ground and helped to reduce violence along the line of
separation between government-controlled Ukraine and the separatist
entities in Donetsk and Luhansk. When Russia's invasion began on 24
February, that mission still had close to 500 international monitors on
the ground and continued its reporting as evacuation commenced. The
mission has now essentially paused activities, although some Ukrainian
staff remain present to carry out limited office functions in some
locations.

Aside from monitoring, the OSCE acted as a mediator bringing together
Russia, Ukraine and the de facto entities in eastern Ukraine within the
so-called Trilateral Contact Group. The negotiations failed to settle
the conflict in line with the 2014 and 2015 Minsk Agreements, which
brought the war's first phase of major fighting to a halt. But they did
broker truces, for example in July 2020, which led to a marked reduction
in hostilities. The talks also helped improve the situation of the
civilian population in the areas affected by the conflict in eastern
Ukraine, for example by enabling civilians to cross the line of
separation.

The framework for these mediation efforts no longer exists. Russia's
recognition of the de facto separatist entities, and its 24 February
invasion, have rendered meaningless the Minsk Agreements, which foresaw
the reintegration of Donetsk and Luhansk with Ukraine. The OSCE still
has a special representative for Ukraine, Mikko Kinnunen, who was the
main mediator within the Trilateral Contact Group, but his role is
unclear at this point.

Since the start of the war, Poland, which chairs the organisation in
2022, has suspended all regular business, holding meetings only of two
political bodies -- the Permanent Council and the Forum for Security
Cooperation -- which were entirely dedicated to Ukraine. These meetings
featured strongly worded condemnations of Russia and coordinated
walkouts. Along similar lines, in the annual address of the OSCE
Chair-in-Office at the UN Security Council on 14 March, Polish Foreign
Minister Zbigniew Rau likened Russia's actions in Ukraine to "state
terrorism".

Beyond symbolic acts, the OSCE has only a handful of available tools for
responding to the war in Ukraine, given the polarisation among its
participating states and its convention of operating by consensus. On 3
March, it mandated a fact-finding expert group to collect information
about violations of human rights and international humanitarian law
committed during the war. But this enquiry will be limited, as the group
has to submit its report within a few weeks. Another tangible and
important step it might take would be to preserve the OSCE's monitoring
mission in Ukraine, whose mandate expires at the end of the month.
Participating states will shortly commence negotiations, but it is
questionable they will extend the mission's mandate as doing so would
require Russia and Ukraine to agree. Absent consensus, they can and
should at least agree to "hibernating" it, rather than shutting it down
completely. Hibernation would mean preserving the mission as a legal
entity and maintaining core administrative functions, even as its
operations remain paused. In the event of a ceasefire, hibernation would
allow for rapid reactivation, saving precious time. Another, though less
likely, possibility is that a reactivated OSCE monitoring mission could
serve as a stopgap until the deployment of a more robust UN or hybrid
UN-OSCE peacekeeping mission.

When it comes to diplomatic engagement, the OSCE is unlikely to serve as
the main mediator aiming to broker a settlement between Russia and
Ukraine, given that Poland -- which has an especially tense relationship
with Moscow -- now holds the chair. But the [OSCE special representative
for Ukraine could use his good offices to address specific issues, for
example facilitating agreements on humanitarian access.]{.underline}

Beyond Ukraine

In countries beyond Ukraine, [the OSCE **continues to play a crucial
conflict management role**. A prime example is Georgia, whose two
breakaway regions -- Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- Russia has recognised
as independent states. Since the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia,
the OSCE has acted as one of three international mediators, along with
the EU and the UN. Together, the trio are responsible for organising the
Geneva International Discussions, a negotiating format that brings
together Georgia, the de facto entities, Russia and the United States.
The talks in Geneva have kept communication channels open and helped
address incidents that otherwise could have escalated.]{.underline}

[In South Ossetia, the OSCE's role has been particularly
important]{.underline}. Much less visible than the EU, which runs a
200-person monitoring mission on the territory controlled by the
Georgian government, [the OSCE is considered an acceptable interlocutor
by Russia and the allied de facto leadership in South Ossetia. The OSCE
has therefore been able to broker deals, for example on water supply and
access to farm land, which have reduced the risk of violence and
improved the lives of people on both sides of the line of
separation.]{.underline}

The Ukraine war risks reopening wounds from 2008 and could upend the
OSCE's diplomatic efforts. Both breakaway regions have demonstrated
strong support for Russia's actions in Ukraine, while Georgia, although
not joining sanctions against Russia, has still sent in an application
for EU membership and voted to condemn Russia's aggression within
international institutions. These developments could have an impact on
prospects for future cooperation and even on negotiation formats that
have helped keep these conflict zones stable for over a decade. A
worrying sign is that the UN, EU and OSCE co-chairs decided to cancel
the forthcoming round of the Geneva talks scheduled at the end of March,
following postponement of their pre-talks visit to the region and to
Russia. The absence of regular talks undermines the OSCE's ability to
act as a mediator just when its role as a go-between may be most needed
to maintain communication between the conflict parties and help address
incidents that could spark violence.

[In Moldova, the OSCE plays an important role, too, acting as a mediator
between the Moldovan government and de facto authorities in separatist
Transdniestria. Its work has helped contain the conflict, stabilising
the situation in a country that is vulnerable to being inflamed by
tensions between Russia and the West. Likewise, the OSCE runs field
operations in the Western Balkans and in Central Asia that perform local
conflict management functions and aim to promote governance reforms,
though the results in each place vary.]{.underline}

The Need to Preserve the OSCE

The deepening rift between Russia and the West threatens the OSCE's very
functioning. As noted, the organisation requires consensus to take
decisions, which in effect bestows veto power on all participating
states. The war in Ukraine risks not only paralysing the OSCE but also
unravelling its core operations. For example, absent agreement among
participating states, the OSCE's field operations, which work to advance
stability and governance reforms across the region, will collapse as
they require annual mandate extensions. It is both possible and
essential to avoid this scenario.

Russia bears the primary responsibility. It must refrain from holding
the OSCE hostage and letting core operations fall apart. Western states
also need to do their part. Their diplomats in Vienna need to find ways
of engaging Russia and seeking pragmatic cooperation, even if it is
difficult to do so in the face of an escalating war that rides roughshod
over OSCE principles. They should refrain from pushing Russia out of the
organisation via the "consensus minus one" rule, which states invoked in
the early 1990s to temporarily exclude the former Yugoslavia on the
grounds of massive human rights violations. Using this rule to suspend
Russia from the OSCE would be both ineffective and dangerous --
ineffective because even if Russia were excluded, its close ally Belarus
could still block decisions, and dangerous because it would probably
lead to Russia's withdrawal, as it did in the Council of Europe.
[Russia's exclusion would likely spell the end of the organisation's
ability to mediate in its neighbourhood, jeopardising its conflict
management role in Bosnia, Moldova, Georgia, Nagorno-Karabakh and
various Central Asian states. These are precisely the areas that may now
experience **increased tensions**, as parties come under political
pressure from Moscow and the West to **take sides.**]{.underline}

Moreover, over the long term in Ukraine, the OSCE could come to play an
important role if Moscow and Kyiv come to a compromise on a ceasefire or
settlement. The existing monitoring mission could be repurposed to help
oversee a ceasefire agreement, shedding light on violations and
facilitating dialogue between the parties. It could also be deployed to
monitor specific agreements, for example ones reached to ensure the
safety of nuclear power plants in Ukraine. The OSCE High Commissioner on
National Minorities could help find creative compromises related to the
place of the Russian language in Ukraine, long a controversial issue,
and OSCE election observers could be deployed in the event of post-war
elections in Ukraine. However far off such issues may seem in the face
of an escalating war, they will be among the issues the parties will
have to grapple with when the fighting stops.

[All of these are reasons not to burn the bridge between Russia and the
West that the OSCE represents, even as it faces the most serious threat
since its creation. Participating states should work to ensure the
OSCE's continued functioning, preserving its precious remaining space
for pragmatic cooperation on international security matters in
Europe.]{.underline} They must also try to shield the OSCE's work beyond
Ukraine -- in places like Moldova, Georgia and Bosnia, where it helps to
keep communication channels open, promote dialogue and resolve incidents
that could spark violence. These efforts have helped lower tensions for
years, and they are [all the more valuable now that the fallout of the
war in Ukraine]{.underline} **[creates fresh escalation
risks.]{.underline}**

A greater challenge to the OSCE collaborative problem-solving efforts
has been the rising tension between Russia and the West. During the
early 1990s, Yeltsin and other Russian leaders embraced the organization
as the potential centerpiece for a future collaborative European
security architecture. [In subsequent years, however, the Western
participating States placed **[increasing emphasis on expanding
NATO]{.mark}** and the EU, [to the **detriment of the OSCE**.]{.mark}
The expansion of NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic
in 1999, and an additional seven states including the Baltic republics
in 2004, drove home the view among Russian leaders that the OSCE was
"erecting a wall within itself, artificially [dividing its members into
the NATO]{.mark} and EU members, [and the rest."]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Under these new conditions]{.underline}, declared Russian Foreign
[Minister Sergei Lavrov, "[NATO deals with security issues]{.mark}, the
EU with economic issues, [while the OSCE will only monitor]{.mark} the
adoption of these organizations' values by countries that have remained
outside the EU and NATO."35]{.underline}

5 Conclusion

The positive aspect of the Report is the suggestion regarding the
adoption of a constitutional charter for the OSCE. This is, in our view,
the most relevant aspect. From that fact, several further positive
consequences would develop. First of all, [the clearer international
legal status of the organisation would put the OSCE on the **same
footing** of existing European organisations.]{.underline} Secondly,
better defined organs with their hierarchical position and their powers
would strengthen the operational aspects of the organisation. Thirdly,
the organisation could enter into proper agreements with other
international organisations, in particular the European ones and the
United Nations. [These tools would enhance the visibility of the
organisation in the international context]{.underline} and would
possibly get more support in the general public opinion. Nevertheless,
this solution seems not sufficiently addressed within the Report. As we
have tried to point out, this step would imply both political and legal
issues that may not be easily solved. Some states may not be interested
in having a strong political organisation dealing with a broad range of
security issues ranging from minority rights to disarmament. Due to the
broad concept of security adopted by the OSCE, this would imply relevant
scrutiny in many sensitive areas of states' policy. [Furthermore, the
**risk of overlapping** and multiplication of activities with existing
European organisations should be addressed to avoid criticism regarding
misuse of funding and **duplication of activities by the
OSCE**.]{.underline} The new charter might address these issues and
clearly define the areas of activity. In areas covered by other
international organisations some form of cooperation could be envisaged.
[This issue becomes more difficult in the area of security, with the EU
and NATO expanding their membership towards the East and their action
into the domain of security broadly interpreted. This is the reason why
the OSCE has to come to a better definition of its status otherwise it
might **risk erosion** by the new activities of those
organisations.]{.underline} The positive aspect of OSCE is that it
includes a wide area of states. It is European but it includes also the
USA and Canada, Russia and the Central Asian countries. The dividing
line based on the Cold War confrontation has been replaced by the
membership of the EU and NATO and by criticism of Western European
countries towards all other participating states. Nevertheless, the
broad area covered by the OSCE today, including central Asia, would
comprise geographic zones that may represent important security concerns
for Europe. In this context, it should be noted that still little
interest is placed on the Mediterranean dimension of security. This area
should receive more attention as it presents many aspects related to
security. They include, among others, human trafficking, terrorism and
environmental issues. These policy issues can be addressed in due
course, but the institutional definition of the OSCE has high priority,
and after thirty years it is high time to transform it into a proper
international security organisation, under the aegis of international
law.

[With 57 participating States in North America, Europe and **Asia,** the
OSCE -- the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe -- is
the world's largest regional security organization.]{.underline} The
OSCE works for stability, peace and democracy for more than a billion

practical work that aims to make a lasting difference.

comprehensive approach to security that encompasses the
politico-military, economic and environmental, and human dimensions.
Through this approach, and with its inclusive membership, the OSCE helps
bridge differences and build trust between states by co-operating on
conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation.

When they are viewed in ideal terms, [NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) and OSCE (the Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe) **each represent half of a comprehensive European security
organization.** NATO, with nineteen members in March 1999, organizes
armed forces to deter aggression and to undertake peacekeeping and peace
enforcement missions in Europe. The OSCE, with a more comprehensive
membership of 55 states, has come to specialize in conflict prevention
and in post-conflict peace-building - elections, police, and civil
administration]{.underline}. Today, both organizations are deeply
involved in the struggle over Kosovo. It is fairly evident, whatever the
outcome of the dispute over Kosovo and over the treatment of the
Kosovars, that both organizations will continue into the future. But
NATO, which is conducting a military action against Serbia, risks much
more with its Kosovo involvement than the OSCE, which thus far has a
subordinate role. If NATO can cope with the Kosovar refugees, bring them
back to Kosovo into relatively tolerable material conditions, reach an
understanding with Serbia to allow Kosovo far-reaching autonomy within
Serbia and can provide an effective peacekeeping contingent to assure
implementation of this agreement, its prestige as it enters the next
century will be high; OSCE\'s repute is likely to be carried along with
that of NATO. If NATO fails in significant respects on Kosovo, the
damage to European and [Transatlantic unity will be great and the
ensuing debate over NATO\'s proper role and that of the OSCE is likely
to continue for years]{.underline}. In this situation, the general
feasibility of multilateral military actions in support of human rights
will also be placed in question. Even if the Kosovo crisis ultimately
subsides, whether favourably or not, these two halves of an ideal
European security organization, NATO and OSCE, are not likely to come
together anytime soon to form a single, comprehensive institution. As
already indicated, the current state of productive coexistence has not
always characterized relations between the two organizations. During the
Cold War years, the main role of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe, as the OSCE was called prior to 1995, was to
promote discussion and negotiation between East and West. This role was

West, but ultimately supported as a vehicle for promoting Western
political views in Warsaw Pact states. At that point, CSCE was
considered a potentially useful but not essential complement to NATO,
which was charged with the main responsibility for defending Europe.

Given Russia's actions, it's difficult (though not impossible) to see
how such a force could be administered by the U.N. Security Council. And
given sensitivities on both sides of the NATO-Russia divide, it's
unlikely that NATO could replicate in Ukraine its role leading the
Implementation Force (IFOR), the Multinational Stabilization Force
(SFOR) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in the former Yugoslavia. An
alternative model is the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO)
peacekeeping mission, which has been deployed in the Sinai since 1981.
The MFO is funded by a group of donor nations and manned and supplied by
a group of troop-contributing nations. In a similar way, Ukraine could
invite trusted partners to contribute personnel, material and funding to
this effort. [The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe

### 2NC -- AT: Perm Do the CP -- Members

#### International organization are autonomous actors and distinct from their member state

**Hirschmann 21** \[Gisela Hirschmann, November 2021, "Article

contestation: from inertia to resilience," \<\<Hirschmann is the

Affairs, Volume 97, Issue 6\][\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

The responses of IO bureaucracies to member state contestation The
existence of IOs relies on contributions of money and personnel, a
functioning membership body and policies implemented by member states.10
States use numerous ways not only to influence IOs according to their
interests, but also to contest IOs' authority or individual policies.11
While membership withdrawals and budget cuts are nothing new in the
history of IOs, these acts can pose a significant threat to the
existence of IOs, especially if driven by nationalist and populist
attitudes.12 [This article is based on the assumption that IOs are
**autonomous actors**]{.underline} and therefore have an inherent
interest in maintaining their positions in the current multilateral
order.13 In response to member state contestation, some IOs opt for a
conciliatory tone in their communicative responses, whereas others are
more assertive.14 This article builds on previous studies by focusing on
the role of bureaucracies in shaping IO responses to contestation by
member states. Drawing on the insights of organization theory, I propose
three types of bureaucratic responses: inertia, adaptation and
resilience-building. Inertia[. We should not expect IOs always to
respond with action to member state contestation.]{.underline} On the
contrary, there might not be any immediate response to the challenges.
Not responding can be a strategic decision; but it can also mean that an
IO is simply ignoring the challenge and sticking to institutional
routines.15 Inertia can therefore be a result of either a strategic
decision or an organization's 'blind spots'.16 Following McConnell and
't Hart, I define inertia as 'an instance and/or pattern of
non-intervention' by an IO in response to member state contestation.17
How can inertia be observed at the bureaucratic level? Research has
shown that IOs communicate strategically.18 Avoiding 'unfavorable
headlines' through overt judicial activism has been identified as a
'survival strategy' used in particular by international courts and human
rights institutions facing a populist backlash.19 Hunkering down allows
the IO bureaucracy to keep a low profile and to continue its work
without changes. Empirically, hunkering down can be observed, for
example, in an IO bureaucracy's refusal to issue public statements or
press declarations on a contested issue, or regarding its relationship
with the challenging member state, indicating an overall decrease in
public visibility. Adaptation. This response type is based on the
theoretical assumptions of the principal--agent approach, according to
which IOs, as the agents of their member states, make efforts to satisfy
the principals' demands.20 Thus the IO changes its policy to maintain
the support of the challenging member state(s). Some decades ago, the
threat of significant budget cuts by the US government under President
Reagan led to adaptation in policy- and decision-making in, for example,
the World Bank.21 Further indicators of adaptation are policy reforms
that grant the challenging state greater influence. Adaptation aims at
accommodating the contesting state to the point where this state
refrains from further contestation. IO bureaucracies actively shape
adaptation through framing and negotiation. To demonstrate to the
challenging member state its willingness to adapt, an IO may rename a
contested policy (e.g. adopting 'maternal health' instead of
'reproductive health') or stop the implementation of contested
programmes (e.g. projects addressing climate change in response to the
Trump administration's budget cuts). Moreover, we know from previous
research that [IO bureaucracies influence institution-building and shape
the agenda of international negotiations.22 We can thus expect these
bureaucracies to actively negotiate aspects of policies and budgets with
individual member state governments, especially if their resources are
based primarily on voluntary contributions.23]{.underline}

Russia in NATO: «\...contra». However, possible membership of Russia in
NATO entails not only the benefits mentioned above but also a number of
[unavoidable problems that could have influence on the decision making
process Moscow\'s membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
included]{.underline}. It could not have been any other way, keeping in
mind decades of \"cold\" war and the recent tensions between the two
sides on the issue of NATO expansion and the conflict in Kosovo. These
problems may be common for both Russia and NATO but they also may be
regarded individually as having importance to Moscow or Brussels. The
following may be counted as problems common for both Russia and NATO: ·
[**psychological compatibility.** Even with an expediency of the
alliance in mind, it will be hard for both sides to make a 100 percent
turn after **decades of being enemies**, after viewing each other mainly
as targets through the slit of a sight and the relationship -- as a zero
sum game.]{.underline} The matter is not only with the countries\'
leaders but also the general public mood that can be easily used by the
«hawks» (such as Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Senator Helms and 32 others). The
West will probably go through an easier adaptation process since it
already has such experience (Germany, Spain, former socialistic states).
[With its tendency to view the world in black and white colours only,
Russia will have more difficulties overcoming the physiological
barriers.]{.underline} · transparency, first of all in the issues of
military (nuclear) and mobilisation planning, intelligence information,
especially received through agents or electronic means of interception.
Of course, the confidence measures practised in Europe since the times
of the first detente in the 70\'s have somewhat weakened the obsession
of military people for secrecy. However, the spy obsession still common
for both sides. This question is extremely delicate; usually it is not
discussed openly and honestly which may lead to additional tensions and
suspicions in the process of Russia and NATO cooperation. It is enough
to say that the presence of NATO officers in the headquarters of the
General Staff poses great problems for Russian officers. It is also
correct to say that many Western generals will find it difficult to
adjust themselves to participation of Russian military men in the
meeting of NATO nuclear planning committee. [The probable Russia's
membership in NATO is more likely to cause a series of difficult
questions for its politicians and militaries]{.underline}. However, they
are quite predictable. So, there is time to think about ways of avoiding
them or lessening their probable negative impact on the relations
between Russia and NATO under new circumstances. Despite their
difficulties, these problems are solvable. But because these are
Russia's problems, the responsibility for their solving is mainly on its
side. The following are the problems caused by the country\'s probable
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. · First of all,
[it is important to understand that the Russian **political elite is not
ready** for such a radical step. It is so used to **exploiting the image
of an external enemy** (that was usually presented as NATO) for its
domestic needs that losing such a possibility will cause a confusion in
the ranks of political and military establishment]{.underline}. Joining
NATO will mean that everything said about it before (and equally, about
Russia itself) is exactly the other way round. That is why Moscow makes
a lot of reservations even if cooperation with NATO is very limited. The
main idea here is to make the public believe that Moscow cooperates with
NATO only because the alliance constantly makes fundamental concessions.
However, the details of such 'concessions', for example during the
eastward NATO expansion, the Dayton Agreements or the military actions
in Yugoslavia, are usually not revealed to the public. In the 33 end the
Russian political elite will have to decide on what NATO means and can
mean for Russia? Is it an ally? A partner? Or an enemy who skilfully
covers its true intentions? There are reasons to believe that the
Russian establishment does not have answers to these questions even for
itself.. · Russia will have to determine the form of joining NATO: will
it become member of the political or the military organisation as well?
Those who think that under current conditions Russia simply does not
have any choice and thus is faced to join NATO believe that membership
in the political organisation is the lesser of the two evils. Those who
think that joining NATO would benefit Russia rather than harm it are
certain that the country should join the military organisations as well.
Thinking rationally, Moscow will (under any circumstances) go for the
first option and only then, having gained certain experience, decide on
the second one. · [Russia will have to make a decision on its nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. No doubt, it will remain under national
jurisdiction just as it is in the case of all NATO members who posses
it. But Russia will have to answer the question whether this kind of
arms will constitute a nuclear shield for the collective defence of NATO
or rather be used for collective security of the post Soviet space only?
Will the NATO Nuclear planning committee determine its probable use in
some way (what way)? To what extent does the nuclear cooperation between
Russia and NATO fit the nuclear policy of the latter? Is the cooperation
of all four nuclear possessing members possible in the framework of the
alliance? [· The unpredictable response of the CIS countries to Russian
membership in NATO may also raise a very important questions for Moscow.
Involved in ethnical and territorial conflicts, all these countries,
especially in Central Asia, have problems interpreting
democracy.]{.underline} These states could deliberately draw Russia into
the processes of conflict resolution in the area. In the case of
Moscow's membership in NATO, Russia would have to deal with those issues
not as a neighbouring state but rather as a member of the alliance.
However, [other NATO allies would not be too happy about that: through
Russia they could also become involved **(military) in
conflicts**]{.underline}. In this situation, it is unclear how the
system of collective defence will function: will Moscow remain its
participant or not? Finally, a paradoxical situation can occur in the
triangle NATO-Russia-Belarus. Will Minsk be automatically seen as member
of the alliance keeping in mind that the two neighbouring 34 countries
form something like a union state? It is very probable that the reaction
of some post Soviet states who regard NATO with suspicion may be similar
to the reaction of Russia as the ex-WTO allies were joining NATO and as
the Baltic states are being considered for membership. · Used to gaining
benefits from the contradictions between Russia and the West in the
recent years, [China will be not too excited about Russian membership in
NATO]{.underline}. Peking usually frightened Moscow with closer
relationship with the West, and the West -- with probable coming
together with Moscow. In this manner, China hoped to gain certain
benefits on both directions. China will lose this possibility as soon as
Moscow joins NATO. However, it can do nothing to oppose their united
efforts. Besides, after Russia joins NATO, the enlarged alliance comes
closely to the Chinese borders. For Peking, this would bring a change in
the whole geopolitical configuration in a region where its influence has
not been questioned before. The reaction of PRC on the rapprochement
between Russia and NATO and the participation of Moscow in the
alliance's structures will probably be similar to that of Russia during
the NATO eastward expansion. On the other hand, the reaction of Japan
may be more favourable since a compromise between Russia and the West
may be viewed as a precursor of a compromise between Moscow and Tokyo on
the issue of the Kuril Islands. · Joining NATO may have positive effects
on both the process of democratisation of military forces and the
society as a whole as well as on emerging of the civil structures in
Russia. However, under conditions of not finally asserted democratic
values, it is important to understand that those who have not yet
accepted these values or even deny them may accuse NATO and the Russian
political leaders of imposing the alien values upon the society and the
country. This mainly applies to the Russian generals who have lately
build up their influence on the country\'s political leaders. As a
result, an ideological confrontation and even a significant split in the
Russian society on that issue may be expected. In turn, the possible
membership of Russia in NATO may cause certain difficulties and problems
for the West and the members of the alliance. There are those in the
West who believe that these problems may be insoluble for the alliance.
To which extent are these assumptions well grounded? And what are the
most obvious problems nowadays? · The main concern of the West comes
from the contention that Russian presence in the alliance may simply
destroy it. Chaos and lack of stability in the country, corruption among
35 political elite, including military one as well, the penetration of
criminal elements into business -- all these distinguishing feature of
contemporary Russia could spread to other members of the alliance. As a
result, instead of positively influencing Russia, NATO will be
negatively influenced by the new member. That is more than probable if
Russia turns more clearly towards an authoritarian rule. Of course, by
the time Moscow enters the alliance it will have to meet the majority of
the problems; otherwise it will not be accepted by NATO. However, Russia
is a transforming country; its internal as well as external structures
are not yet stable. These structures are in a state of flux; they are
renewed in some areas while go back to the old model (today Russia
counts 89 subjects of Federation, tomorrow there may be seven left;
Today Moscow has good relations with Byelarus, tomorrow they may be
changed for the worst; Russia's nearest environment is too hostile to be
predictable) So, Russia may be a powerful generator of instability
inside the alliance. That is why NATO members will always be afraid of
having to deal with inner peacekeeping rather than with outer one. · The
post Soviet space by itself is an enormous conflict area; and Russia has
to a certain degree taken the responsibility for settling the ethnical
and political conflicts in the region. There is a concern that having
joined NATO, Russia would try handing this burden over to other alliance
members. However, they are not interested to overburden themselves with
different problems in Georgia and Abhasia, Tadjikistan, Azerbaijan,
Nagorny Kharabach and Armenia. Chechnya alone poses enough difficulties
to the West. Quite possibly, NATO will not be willing to handle
territorial problems that exist between Russia and Japan, Russia and
Finland, or the problems of illegal migration form China to Siberia and
the Far East. · All that mentioned above brings up the following
question: to what extent is Article 5 of the Washington Treaty
applicable to Russia? For example, to what degree is it applicable in
the case of the Chechen invasion into Dagestan in the fall of 1999? Some
Western experts believe that if Russia joins the alliance, there will be
a need for certain qualifications that would exclude automatic
application of Article 5 to Russia and require additional consultations.
[However, this would change NATO status from an organisation of
collective defence to an organisation of collective security. To what
extent do other members agree with that? Another question -- in that
case, is there any sense for Russia to join NATO? If NATO does not want
to take over responsibility for Russia, what sense does it make for
Russia to take the responsibility for other alliance members in terms of
their security?]{.underline}

1.  Introduction

Increased use of technology in civil, military, and commercial sectors,
and associated threats have forced scholars and States to consider the
international law implications of this new reality. After States,
international organizations, and international coordinating fora
endorsed the application of international law to cyberspace, [the debate
shifted to questions of how existing principles, rights, and obligations
should be interpreted in the cyber realm.]{.underline}2 Various
exercises have attempted to identify the applicable international rules,
possible State responses, and legal consequences of cyberoperations,
both during war and during peacetime.

States quickly realized that national security heavily depends on
international cooperation. [International efforts to counter
cybersecurity risks debuted with Russia's introduction of a first United
Nations (U.N.) resolution on this topic in 1998.3]{.underline} Numerous
cyber policy fora have proliferated since then in diverse formats, such
as the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field
of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International
Security (GGE), the subsequent U.N. Open-Ended Working Group on
Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International
Security (OEWG), and other industryfocused norm processes. 4 These
multistakeholder initiatives started to shape cooperative tools, norms
of behavior, and confidence-building measures (CBMs) in support of
collective cybersecurity. [One of the exercises which is regarded among
the **most successful by the international community is the high-level
agreement** on principles, norms, and rules of the road for national
internet activities and transnational cyber interactions, conducted
under the auspices of the Organization for Cooperation and Security in
Europe **(OSCE).**]{.underline}

In pursuit of its mandate to promote human rights and conflict
prevention, the [OSCE can play a major role to support
operationalization of international law and application of existing
principles to the cyber realm]{.underline}. This paper examines some key
steps for the aftermath of the creation of norms of behavior, and
transparency and confidence-building measures (TCBMs). After a brief
analysis of norm-creation processes (part II), this paper will identify
some of the most pressing cybersecurity challenges on the international
landscape (part III), and offer some suggestions for consolidating the
voluntary non-binding norms States already agreed upon (part IV). Using
the lessons learned from other domains, the analysis will focus on
mechanisms of building further stability and transparency in cyberspace,
in particular by reference to the due diligence principle and States'
human rights obligations.

#### It solves -- even if it is non-binding -- they can still generate effective norms in cybersecurity

4\. The process of consolidating existing norms under the OSCE umbrella

4.1 The old and new role of the OSCE

The more we try to perceive conflict as a manifestation of failed
management of disagreements, the higher are the chances of developing
efficient conflict prevention measures.35 Norm-making processes offer
valuable opportunities for stakeholders to recognize the effects of
limited trust between major powers and the means to overcome them.
Regional organizations such as the OSCE were created as a response to
the need observed by States to build trust and strengthen cooperation
and are often regarded as holding the key to the impasse at the global
level.36

[Regional organizations have a long history of working with CBMs in
conventional security areas.]{.underline} 37 [The OSCE, the world's
largest security-oriented regional organization, has a direct mandate to
work on reducing risks of conflict in Europe, and **successfully
played** the role it assumed in 2011 to **strengthen
cybersecurity**.38]{.underline} In 2017, [the OSCE had already developed
sixteen practical and actionable measures in this area, which can be
grouped into two main clusters: transparency and cooperation
measures]{.underline}. These tools aim at enhancing cooperation,
transparency, predictability, and stability, to reduce the risks of
misperception, escalation, and conflict, that may stem from the use of
ICTs. 39 These goals are tackled through information-sharing,
improvement of national protective capacities, cooperation on incident
response, and refrainment from destabilizing State practices.40

Due to its long history of promoting constructive dialogue, [the OSCE is
**best suited to continuously respond** to regional concerns or needs,
not only of like-minded participating States, but also to bring together
non-likeminded States which are in different stages of cyber
development]{.underline}.[41 OSCE's active efforts in shaping
developments in the cyber domain, including **setting the global tone**
for the development and operationalization of norms and CBMs, is broadly
recognized by its partner organizations and in GGE
reports.42]{.underline} As the current OSCE's focus is to implement
already agreed CBMs, rather than pursuing additional cyber norms, this
paper aims at arguing several tools of effective consolidation. 43
First, this process should build on previously agreed principles and
norms, and focus on issues which received broad support by individual
States, or by parallel processes, such as the GGE. Although due
diligence is not widely endorsed as a binding rule of international law,
there is currently widespread support of this non-binding norm of
responsible State behavior. 44 [**Voluntary non-binding norms can**
progressively acquire customary international law status, as well as
third party endorsement]{.underline}. Efficient norms may generate
productive imitation, especially if these are agreed by soft powers, as
the espionage case illustrates.45 Therefore, simplicity might be the
key, by reaching political commitments among a group of like-minded
actors, by operationalization of agreements and development of
culturally grounded behavioral expectations.[46 The potential for
practical implementation of CBMs makes them unique instruments, not just
in the OSCE area, but as a source of good practices for other
organizations to replicate.47]{.underline} Second, [the OSCE efforts
**escape many of the hurdles of high-level political commitments,**
including vague language, and focus on directive steps.48 The
stakeholders should identify and capitalize on the benefits of regional
bodies, including their capacity to be more responsive to the changing
environment, and the closed sessions with less public scrutiny, where
States' concerns can be more effectively addressed.]{.underline} 49
Moreover, benefiting from an established Secretariat and attached
procedures[, States can adapt OSCE information-sharing platforms to even
more robust frameworks. As a **neutral organization**, with a clear
mandate, the OSCE can act as an objective forum, because it does not
have defense or sanctioning prerogatives.]{.underline} Third, the [OSCE
should capitalize on the participation of its stakeholders, which are
States, **primary actors of international law**.]{.underline} While
other norm-making laboratories, such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0, are
influential resources, these multilateral efforts are criticized for
only addressing the members of a particular system or alliance, and
therefore, their lack of impact on States that are not involved in that
process.50 The [USA and the Russian Federation]{.underline}, two of the
States that are far apart on fundamental questions of application of
international law to cyberspace, have participated in the GGEs and [are
standing members of the OSCE.]{.underline} Fourth, strengthening the
regional structures for conflict prevention requires a great amount of
political will. However, for broader inclusion, coherence, and
complementarity of efforts, and to avoid risks of duplication,
international partners should enhance their cooperation at all working
levels. More synergy among regional organizations will enhance common
understanding of threats, exchange of lessons learned, and promote
cooperation over competition. These efforts can provide advanced legal
policy training for diplomats and local capacity building, which is
crucial to follow-up on the implementation of CBMs. [The OSCE should
avail itself of the dialogue channels in place and establish new
partnerships for a comprehensive picture of regional views and conflict
prevention mechanisms.]{.underline} Cyberpolicy cooperation and
understanding of States' views and concerns should build on the
significant overlap in membership of the EU, the OSCE, and NATO,
organizations with highly complementary mandates. While the EU focuses
on strengthening resilience through finance and diplomacy, the OSCE's
model of regional security, and NATO's crisis management capacities
could merge into meaningful synergies with the purpose of conflict
prevention and early warning, common features of these organizations'
mandates.51

[Although the OSCE process cannot force States to implement their
recommendations, it can employ preventive and quiet diplomacy, as well
as results orientated dialogue to **find common grounds** on emerging
security challenges.]{.underline}52 As GGE processes share almost
overlapping mandates with the OEWG, [the OSCE can]{.underline} [be among
the most promising venues for **multilateral cybersecurity
cooperation**.]{.underline} In this regard, the OSCE's ability to bring
the United States and Russia to the conversation table is crucial, and
with EU support, it should strive at engaging Chinese representatives as
well. [The People's Republic of China, which takes a similar view to
Russia, also participated in the GGEs, but is not an OSCE
member.]{.underline} The preliminary conversations should focus on
national interpretations and application of fundamental international
law principles. To ensure a candid exchange of views, initial
conversations should be held under Chatham House Rule and avoid public
scrutiny.

Fifth, as the coordinating fora for CBMs, the OSCE, has accumulated
political capital of addressing States' reluctance regarding
information-sharing and inherent challenges that create
multi-stakeholder cooperation problems. [During the previous rounds, the
OSCE gained an overview on which objectives can reasonably be achieved
multilaterally, and which ones are more suited for bilateral cooperation
mechanisms.53 Deriving lessons learned from past processes enables
better approaches to national interests, concerns, and operational
practices.]{.underline} 54

It would be utopic to believe that major powers will agree on
interpretations of every legal institution. Even the experts of the
Tallinn Manual Process could not agree on basic principles, although as
mentioned, they mainly originated from likeminded states and cultures.
The first part of this paper highlighted that the process of
norm-creation may matter as much as the destination, as participants
agree to disagree and understand each other's differences and underlying
rationales.

Another important endeavor is the analysis of past and present
challenges of effective implementation of voluntary norms. The OSCE
should strive at assisting States to recognize the prospective domestic
and foreign policy value of recognizing CBMs.55 The reasons why some of
the measures were perceived as being less important, implementation
challenges, and responses within the civil society and industry shall be
thoroughly examined.

The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is sometimes cited as a
possible model for future cybersecurity cooperation. 56 [This approach
has been described as a **"coalition of the willing**" against a global
threat by means of flexible coordination of national and international
instruments.57]{.underline} The proposed institutional architecture
encourages collective action for a common cause, without requiring
legally binding commitments. This agreement is also recognized for
reaching a political commitment by only a few States, which accepted
that they have different capacities and resources to identify and
respond to threats. This initiative represents a successful example of
voluntary cooperation, first among like-minded States, around
enforcement of specific, agreed norms of behavior.

The OSCE participating States should capitalize on lessons learned to
operationalize norms in a practical manner, such as was the case of the
1990 OSCE Vienna Document on Negotiations on CSBMs, which contained
voluntary military measures aiming at enhancing transparency, trust
building, and arms control. [After their translation into the cyber
realm, these tools departed from the traditional military components of
CSBMs and adopted more cyber diplomacy approaches, **bringing both
likeminded and non-likeminded States to the table.**58]{.underline}

4.2 OSCE work and pressing cyberthreats

Part III of the paper detailed why States' recognition of their due
diligence obligations is crucial for early warning, a key element of
OSCE mandate. While the previous section suggested some practical steps
for addressing this principle and other delicate cyber issues on which
previous efforts have not concluded with unanimous consent, this section
will emphasize why the most pressing issues require immediate attention.

[First, the solid inter-state cooperation structure provided by OSCE
should be utilized to build on pre-existing commitments to strengthen
existing CBMs related to due diligence and **launch legal and political
conversations** on the preventive aspect of this
principl]{.underline}e.59 This process should include civil society and
industry representatives, who can provide fresh insight on the realistic
capabilities of states to commit, on the requirements and obstacles to
full implementation.

Second, [development of agreed terminology is fundamental for pursuing
further dialogue, as **States can identify areas of agreement and
disagreement** about the translation of the due diligence principle from
other areas of law]{.underline}, such as space law, environmental law,
or law of the sea.60 The same rationale applies to divergent views in
regard to terminology of "essential" or "critical" infrastructure and
associated concerns. In most views, a cyber intrusion against ordinary
hospitals, patients' databases or laboratories would not impact national
care during ordinary times.61 However, given the shortages of medical
infrastructure during the 2020 pandemic, the threshold for the
"essential character" would likely shift. While an infectious disease
hospital or testing facility are expected to be considered indispensable
medical services during a pandemic, the legal effects of deaths
occurring as indirect consequences of cyber intrusions remain
unanswered.62 [Perhaps, the silver lining of recent malicious
cyberoperations is the opportunity for States and multilateral fora to
clarify application of international law, endorse norms, and assert
their credibility.63]{.underline} 5.

Conclusion

[The digital arms race determined numerous States to enhance their
defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and some already defined
cyberspace as a military domain. The future will tell whether an
equivalent of the "Treaty on Open Skies" is possible in cyberspace.64
With the same goal, the value of CBMs is rendered by their mere purpose,
to create **safe and predictable behavior in cyberspace**, and to build
a culture of transparency among stakeholders]{.underline}. This paper
highlighted the value of interregional cooperation on cybersecurity and
the need to institutionalize these dialogues, to operationalize
implementation measures, and strengthen commitments. Despite their slow
pace, CBMs are continuously developed with every State action or
declaration, having a great potential to uphold international peace and
reduce risks of conflict and escalation. Norms of responsible State
behavior seek to define key concepts, such as "red lines" for the use of
ICTs.65 One of the most important thresholds is that States make sure
that the territory or cyber infrastructure under their control is not
used for operations that affect the rights of, and produce adverse
consequences for, other States.

The 2017 GGE demonstrated that there are no guarantees of reaching
international consensus for the creation of norms to secure and govern
cyberspace. [Security threats are inherently transnational, and their
prevention and mitigation will require greater engagement and commitment
from the international community. Their successful approach will **imply
constructive and open conversations among various stakeholders with
divergent priorities**, agendas, and views on international
law.]{.underline} At this moment in time, progress requires continuous
compromise by the major powers, which sometimes express contrasting
interpretations of international law applicable to cyberspace. [OSCE's
contribution and assistance to constructive dialogue, flexible
understanding of legal views, and creation of national practices that
allow implementation is crucial. This model of cooperation, the
norm-setting and CBMs are a model for other regional organizations and
their image should be defended by continuous efforts.]{.underline}

Introduction

[Recent technological and political developments in OSCE participating
States suggest a strong interest in pursuing, testing and using
weaponised AI and weapons systems with increasingly autonomous features
controlled by algorithms]{.underline}. In May 2021 Defence Minister
Sergei Shoigu announced that Russia had begun producing combat robots
"capable of fighting on their own",1 while the French Army is planning
to introduce robotic systems by 2040.2 The United Kingdom (UK)
government has stated its objective of achieving "a leading role in
critical and emerging technologies"3 and has established a Defence
Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy Unit to better understand them.4 In
the United States, the National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence has urged the government "not \[to\] be a witness to the AI
revolution in military affairs".5

The global discussion about autonomous weapons systems is often framed
in a futuristic way and focuses on lethal autonomous weapons systems
(LAWS) -- colloquially called "killer robots" -- or the "AI arms race".
But weaponised AI is already a reality of European security[. Thus far
participating States have been reluctant to utilise the OSCE platform to
address the risks caused by the increasing autonomy of weapons
systems.]{.underline} Building on this issue, this essay intends to
address the following questions: (1) how does the lack of regulation of
weaponised AI affect security and stability in Europe? and (2) what role
can the OSCE play in mitigating the risks related to weaponised AI?

Weaponised AI practices: implications for European security

A United Nations (UN) Security Council report published in March 2021
stated that "lethal autonomous weapons systems were programmed to attack
targets without requiring data connectivity between the operator and the
munition" during the Libyan civil war, referring to the Turkish-made
Kargu 2 armed loitering drone.6 This sparked a wave of worldwide media
reaction, with many headlines claiming that the "age of autonomous
killer robots" has arrived.7 While it is difficult to assess whether a
weapon system has been operated in an autonomous mode, whether in Libya
or elsewhere, this episode indicates that there is increased public
awareness that AI-based weapons are currently being developed, tested
and used.8 In fact, more attention should be paid to the fact that
AI-based autonomy at various levels is already present, among others in
armed aerial loitering drones, ground vehicles and air defence systems.
The concept of autonomy has many definitions and interpretations but is
generally understood to be the ability of a machine to perform an
intended task without human intervention by using the interaction of its
sensors and computer programming with the environment.9

[**Weaponised AI is affecting European security** and stability in two
main ways.]{.underline} Firstly, due to the absence of international
regulations on the use of weaponised AI, the growing trend of automation
and autonomy in weapons systems is silently changing the way in which
humans are involved in the use of force.10 [Current applications of
weaponised AI are shifting the understanding of human control involved
in critical functions of weapons systems, especially those of
identifying and attacking targets.11 For example, many OSCE
participating States use air defence systems with automatic or
semi-automatic features.]{.underline} The automation of critical
functions of air defence systems "has diminished the capacity of human
operators to exercise meaningful human control over specific targeting
decisions".12 The global discussion about autonomous weapons systems is
often framed in a futuristic way, but [weaponised AI is already a
reality of European security.]{.underline} 5 The use of autonomy is
gradually changing warfare norms, similarly to the way in which the
proliferation of armed drones has encouraged targeted killing
operations.[13 Such developments pose legal, ethical and security
risks.]{.underline}

The diminishing role of human control over weapons systems also
infringes upon several principles of international humanitarian law
(IHL) applicable to armed conflict.14 The principles of moral
responsibility and accountability are challenged by the process of
delegating crucial decisions such as selecting and attacking a target to
an autonomous function that has no moral agency.15 Current AI-based
weapons systems are said to be unable to satisfy the requirements of
distinction between legitimate and illegitimate targets during combat.
These types of weapons systems lack the situation awareness necessary to
discriminate between combatants and civilians.16

Moreover, a diminishing human involvement in the operation of weapons
systems with autonomous features has substantial security risks, since
the risk of potentially catastrophic failure "can never be entirely
eliminated".17 Humans do not fully understand AI-based weapons systems,
and the declining role of humans in their operation exacerbates this
knowledge gap. As a UN Institute for Disarmament Research report has
noted, "All complex weapon systems can have failure modes that cannot be
foreseen. But it is likely to be harder to anticipate, quantify and
characterize the risks associated with those issues in autonomous
weapons".18 The factors causing these risks include an acceleration of
the speed of warfare,19 a destabilising effect,20 the strengthening and
"normalisation" of practices such as targeted killings,21 an increase in
the asymmetries of warfare,22 and the proliferation of autonomous
weapons among terrorist organisations and non-state actors.23

Both Azerbaijan and Armenia used uninhabited aerial vehicles during the
2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and several IHL violations such as
indiscriminate attacks on civilians were recorded.24 While these weapons
systems are not officially classified as LAWS, many analysts have deemed
their use to be an efficient way of conducting warfare that could
contribute to other states' pursuit of similar technologies. Since there
is no way of verifying the level of human control over these systems,
operational practices are silently continuing to change the norms of war
and legitimise the use of weaponised AI. In other words, "the
operational trend towards developing AI-enabled weapon systems continues
and is on track to becoming established as 'the new normal' in
warfare".25 While there are no legal norms defining a responsible use of
weaponised AI, the way in which states use this technology will continue
to shape the way warfare is conducted and may increase risks to European
and global security.

[Secondly, the discourse surrounding weaponised AI -- i.e. **how OSCE
participating States talk about LAWS** -- also has a considerable impact
on European security.]{.underline} [Both a common definition of LAWS and
agreement on the appropriate level of human control over weapons systems
are lacking,]{.underline} resulting in the misinterpretation of the
risks that arise. Looking at the discourse of three major players in
European security − France, Russia, and the United Kingdom − one sees
that their official positions converge on the importance of retaining
human control over these weapons. The French Armed Forces minister has
said that "France refuses to entrust the decision of life or death to a
machine that would act in a completely autonomous manner and would be
beyond any human control".26 Russia has said that it "is committed to
the need to maintain human control over LAWS, no matter how 'advanced'
these systems may be".27 The UK Ministry of Defence has noted, "the
operation of our weapon systems will always be under human control and
no UK weapons systems will be capable of attacking targets without
this".28

Nevertheless, autonomy and the concept of appropriate human control over
weapons systems are perceived differently. Russia remains opposed to a
legally binding treaty that would ban LAWS, arguing that the definition
of LAWS should "strike a balance between humanitarian concerns and
\[the\] legitimate defence interests of states".29 France has suggested
a division between "fully" and "partially" LAWS and is only prohibiting
"fully" autonomous weapons.30 Meanwhile, the UK has stated that "an
autonomous system is capable of understanding higher-level intent and
direction", a definition that is more precise and constraining on the
user31 and is "clearly out of step with the definitions used by most
other governments".32

[As a common denominator, these states agree on the principle that
weapons systems should not function completely
autonomously.]{.underline} However, the differences in their views
create misperceptions about the uses of AI, specifically among the
leading states in this sphere, which are all carefully watching one
another's technological developments. There are risks of
misunderstanding, for instance when one state is developing a weapon
system that another state considers to be a lethal autonomous system.
Such communication issues can lead to a security dilemma in which "one
state's pursuit of greater automation and faster reaction times
undermines other states' security, leads them to similarly pursue more
automation just to keep up" and encourages experts to speak of an "AI
arms race".33

Strengthening human control: the role of the OSCE

[Reaching a common position on weaponised AI regulation is
challenging.]{.underline} The current global and European political
atmosphere is one of distrust, particularly between two major European
security players: Russia and the United States. In June 2021 both
President Joe Biden and President Vladimir Putin said that the bilateral
relationship "has deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years".34
There is also distrust of technologies such as the Internet, AI, 5G, and
robotics, not least because they can be weaponised and used for
threatening activities such as cyber attacks. [This environment makes it
difficult to attain a common understanding and commit to agreed
principles on the use of weaponised AI. Nevertheless, the **OSCE
possesses some key advantages** that could make it the platform for
taking a **step forward in the global debate.**]{.underline}

Just like the CCW, the OSCE operates by consensus, which requires it to
seek a compromise among participating States on whatever issue is being
discussed. [However, the organisation has been historically known for
its ambition to form an **inclusive security community** and to build
practices that "suggest a new model of international security" that
is]{.underline} "comprehensive", "indivisible", and
["**cooperative**".35 The OSCE's predecessor, the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe, was a symbol of détente between the United
States and the Soviet Union, and a place for two rivals to find
compromise on security issues, demonstrating the possibility of
coexistence on the European continent.]{.underline}36 The OSCE has not
only been able to survive, but also to adapt to the rising security
challenges of the new world order. [Its broad membership and
comprehensive approach to security make it a key -- if not the **most --
legitimate institution** for European security.37]{.underline} At a time
when some experts debate whether Russian-US relations have entered a new
cold war, the OSCE's inclusive approach is needed to show that tensions
can be dealt with in a forum rather than on the battlefield.

Other international institutions have demonstrated their ambitions to
create some form of AI regulation. In April 2021 the European Commission
presented its legal framework proposal, which could lay down a path
towards defining a regional approach to governing weaponised AI.38 [The
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has also set out its
principles for the responsible use of AI in the area of defence.39 The
key difference is that these institutions have favoured **exclusive
membership** in terms of which prospective countries need to fulfil
specific conditions to join.]{.underline} However, [the **OSCE** has
relatively broad accession rules because it was initially based on the
concept of geopolitical diversity.40 Settling]{.underline} the
differences and [**misunderstandings** between different actors,
especially Russia and the United States, is a key step in achieving a
security agreement such as a commitment to human control over weaponised
AI.]{.underline} In recent years [the Russian discourse has expressed
disappointment that Western countries have made NATO the main European
security organisation.41]{.underline} By engaging with Russia on the
issue of weaponised AI within the OSCE framework, the United States
would contribute to easing the tensions between it and Russia, while
also diminishing the chances of misunderstanding and misinterpretation.
The OSCE's inclusive membership is thus a valuable advantage in terms of
building trust and mitigating the security implications of modern
technologies.'42

What should be the way forward? In the 2019 Luxembourg Declaration on
Advancing Sustainable Development to Promote Security, the OSCE The
OSCE's inclusive approach is needed to show that tensions can be dealt
with in a forum rather than on the battlefield. Parliamentary Assembly
urged "participating States to support international negotiations to ban
lethal autonomous weapons with a view to establishing international,
legally binding rules".43 A legally binding treaty banning the
development of weaponised AI would be challenging, given that, unlike
nuclear weapons or blinding lasers, AI is not a specific type of weapon
and can also be applied for civilian use.44 Some participating States
hold the position that a ban will affect the development of useful
civilian technology. Within the framework of the CCW, Russia has argued
that banning LAWS too hastily could "hinder technological progress",45
while the UK government believes that "a legally binding instrument
which hampers the legitimate development and use of such technologies
would be counterproductive".46

[As a realistic starting point, the OSCE's confidence- and
securitybuilding measures (CSBMs) could provide a framework to exchange
information and observations on the use of weaponised AI, in order to
facilitate communication and dialogue.]{.underline}47 The OSCE already
has CSBMs for information communication technologies, which, like
weaponised AI, create "an area with much room for speculation, doubt,
and ambiguity" and "increase the potential for tensions between
States".48 There is also the potential to go further than exchanging
information informally within the CSBMs framework.

Based on the recommendations of the International Panel on the
Regulation of Autonomous Weapons, the next step should be to "focus on
the obligation to maintain human control over the use of force", which
would "apply to all conventional weapons".49 Taking this path will avoid
the debate on defining LAWS, which has been hindering the progress of
the CCW discussions. In 2019 the GGE on LAWS adopted a set of guiding
principles that are broad, have no legally binding force and do not
clarify the concept of human control, only stating that "human
responsibility for decisions on the use of weapons systems must be
retained since accountability cannot be transferred to machines".50
While OSCE member States accept in principle the importance of human
control, they have until now not been able to agree on a common
definition of this concept. The commitment to human control should be
enshrined in a normative framework such as a political declaration or a
manual of best practices. Any such document would already be a step
forward. It could be part of the Vienna Document or the result of a new
OSCE working group.

[Importantly, an OSCE political declaration or guide on human control
and weaponised AI would not undermine or negate the efforts at the CCW
but would build on them.]{.underline} Shifting the discussion towards
the current impacts of weaponised AI rather than the potential future
impact of "killer robots" would help to mitigate the risks inherent in
these technologies. It would demonstrate that finding consensus,
especially in an atmosphere of political distrust, is possible. While
debates at the CCW continue, the operational trend towards further
autonomy in the armed forces of OSCE participating States is a reality.
Practices related to the use of weaponised AI have the potential to
shape warfare norms. Yet this trajectory is not inevitable, and with the
right approach, a political declaration containing a common definition
of human control would be a realistic achievement.

A political declaration should therefore contain a commitment to
retaining human control over AI-driven weapons systems. This would be a
crucial step towards addressing regional security threats and creating
an international framework on weaponised AI[. The **history and
membership** of the OSCE make it the **most appropriate organisation**
to build trust and take a key step forward on weaponised AI when global
discussion at the UN is stalling and operational trends continue to
increase the use of autonomous weapons systems.]{.underline}

Shifting the discussion towards the current impacts of weaponised AI
rather than the potential future impact of "killer robots" would help to
mitigate the risks inherent in these technologies.

Conclusion

Current practices related to the use of weaponised AI are already
impacting European stability and security. Operational trends that
reflect a reduction in the level of human control over weapons with
increasingly autonomous features pose significant legal, ethical and
security risks. Moreover, the lack of definition of LAWS and agreement
on an appropriate level of human control among states creates
uncertainty and potential misinterpretation. [However, the trajectory of
AI is not permanently set to be an "arms race". Finding a common
agreement is a challenging, but not impossible task. The OSCE is a
promising platform to build on the stalled discussions at the CCW,
because it has a history of acting as a bridge between various
perspectives of European security. It is an inclusive organisation that
**brings together the key developers** of weaponised AI and players in
European security]{.underline}. By debating this issue at the OSCE and
agreeing on a political declaration containing a commitment to human
control, participating States will address some of the risks of
autonomous weapons systems and demonstrate the relevance of the OSCE in
tackling the impact of modern technologies and their use in conventional
weapons.

#### Even if OSCE is slightly dysfunctional it is still necessary AND security cooperation can restore it

**Sammut 20** \[Dennis Sammut, 08-06-2020, "The OSCE is Dysfunctional --
But Necessary," Security and Human Rights,
https://www.shrmonitor.org/the-osce-is-dysfunctional-but-necessary/\]\\\\pairie

[The ongoing crisis raises serious questions about the organization's
fundamental goals --- as well as **about the very future of the OSCE
itself.**]{.underline}

Roots of dysfunction

The OSCE is the successor of the Conference for Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which helped contain, and later defuse,
the Cold War between the United States (U.S.) and its European allies in
NATO on the one hand, and the Soviet Union and its allies in the Warsaw
Pact on the other.

The CSCE produced important documents such as the 1975 Helsinki Final
Act, the 1990 Paris Charter and the Copenhagen Document, in addition to
key conflict prevention tools, including on arms control. Turning the
conference into an organization was meant to consolidate this process
and to create a mechanism by which its many principles and ideas could
be implemented.

But despite agreement on that larger aspiration, the OSCE suffered from
divergent expectations by participating States from the very beginning.

For its part, Russia had hoped the OSCE would lead to the dissolution of
NATO, or at least ensure that the alliance would not expand its
membership. Western countries, meanwhile, saw the OSCE as an
organization through which "to manage relations with Russia",
particularly in the former Soviet space, which Moscow quaintly calls
"the near abroad".

Both sides were hugely disappointed. [NATO membership has nearly doubled
since the establishment of the OSCE, from 16 countries in 1994 to 30
today]{.underline}. And despite the "honeymoon period" between Russia
and the West in the 1990s, the OSCE later failed to contain Russia's
geopolitical ambitions under Vladimir Putin, particularly in the
Caucasus region and in Ukraine --- where the principles of sovereignty
and territorial integrity enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act were
openly flouted.

Living with this failure while still attempting to engage Russia as a
constructive participant has long been a central test for the
organization's leadership.

Thus, the OSCE has become less important for both sides, a trend which
eventually reflected itself in the political commitment of participating
States. With the exception of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine
in 2014, political support for using the OSCE as a primary instrument to
address issues affecting security in the wider Europe have gradually
diminished. Moreover, OSCE states have increasingly politicized
administrative processes like approving the budget, appointing senior
officials, and setting the agenda for meetings.

Many Foreign Ministers were not ready to invest time and political
capital in the organization; some did not even show up at annual
Ministerial Council meetings. For example, when was the last time the
British Foreign Secretary and the French Foreign Minister attended an
OSCE Ministerial meeting? Furthermore, during the annual Ministerial
meeting in Milan in December 2018, the Italian Foreign Minister did not
even bother to stay until the end of the two-day meeting.

Moreover, successive OSCE Secretary Generals succumbed to the same
temptation to enlarge the bureaucracy and budget. Participating States
began asking if they were getting any value for their money, while the
annual OSCE budget debate became an occasion for recrimination. The
current budget of approximately 140 million Euros may not be excessive,
particularly when compared with other organizations, but compared to
18.9 million, which was the budget in the OSCE's first full year of
existence in 1995, it is clear that the OSCE has become much costlier
for its members.

Some attribute many of the organization's problems to its
consensus-driven decision-making process, and particularly to the fact
that any one country --- regardless how small --- can veto any decision.
Yet, if at the peak of the Cold War the CSCE could make consensus-based
decisions and produce a historic document such as the Helsinki Final
Act, there are few reasons that agreeing on the OSCE budget should be so
difficult.

For some countries, however, the compromises involved have become
morally and financially too costly. This is maybe also one of the main
reasons for the current crisis.

Time to scrap the OSCE?

[Still, dysfunctional as it is, the OSCE remains an **important
framework for dealing with European security issues.**]{.underline}

[It is the guardian of the much-cherished Helsinki Final Act, and a
forum that allows all European countries to sit together]{.underline}
--- with the additional participation of the U.S. and Canada --- to
discuss the security issues affecting a vast geographical space between
Vancouver and Vladivostok. [It also empowers small countries, even if at
an organizational and political cost. Given the current global tensions,
the collapse of many arms control mechanisms, and the increasing signs
of authoritarianism and radicalization, it is needed more than
ever.]{.underline}

Those who champion the OSCE --- in the chancelleries of Europe, as well
as in the think tank community, civil society and the academic world ---
need to stand up in defense of the organization.

It is also regrettable that the mainstream media has ignored the OSCE
for so long. Some outlets are not represented in Vienna, which may be a
contributing factor for the bad behavior of certain delegations, since
neither their capitals nor their media are paying much attention.

But the current situation should alert journalists across the Continent
to the seriousness of the crisis unfolding inside the OSCE.

From crisis to opportunity

[A long overdue period of reflection on the future of the OSCE is now
underway, although it should have been triggered by better
circumstances. The organization needs to refocus on its core task:
**maintaining security through cooperation.**]{.underline}

#### OSCE is still helpful in other instances and provides a platform for settlement -- even if they couldn't prevent the Ukraine conflict

When Helga Maria Schmid spoke with DW in Vienna about the end of the
OSCE\'s special monitoring mission to Ukraine, the words she chose were
\"very unfortunate\" and \"heartbreaking.\" Schmid, the secretary
general of the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, or OSCE, had decided to evacuate international staff members and
relocate local employees when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.
\"This mission has done an incredibly good amount of work,\" said
Schmid, who is German. \"Not only in terms of observing the cease-fire
--- but our more than 1,300 monitors were really our eyes and ears on
the ground,\" she added. [The OSCE is the world\'s largest security
body, with 57 member countries from North America, Central Asia and
Europe, including Ukraine and Russia.]{.underline} Helga Maria Schmid
Helga Maria Schmid, a German diplomat, has been OSCE secretary general
since 2020 After Russia\'s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014,
this was an important factor in positioning the organization as a
neutral mediator --- or \"the only organization acceptable by everyone;
first responders, so to say,\" as Schmid put it. Also with the flaring
up of armed conflict between Russian-backed separatists and the
Ukrainian military in the Donbas region, the OSCE stood ready to fulfill
one of its key tasks: working to rebuild peace and security in Europe.
[But in Ukraine, it\'s been thwarted. Now the question remains: How can
the organization live up to its potential?]{.underline} Useful role
under a limited mandate The mission in Ukraine was the OSCE\'s largest
to date. Antje Grawe, the mission\'s acting head, told DW the unarmed
monitors had been working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They went
on patrols, mainly in eastern Ukraine, observing what was going on and
reporting on developments on the ground. Nikola Golubov joined the
mission as a monitoring officer from his home country of North Macedonia
almost right from its start. \"While on patrol, we would always talk to
civilians and ask them what challenges they were experiencing,\" he
said. They checked whether Ukrainians still had access to medical
services, or running water, electricity and gas. Could their children
attend school, and were they able to cross the contact line and meet
with their relatives? Jamie Shea of Friends of Europe Jamie Shea, a
senior fellow at Friends of Europe, said the OSCE continues to be a
platform for dialogue Over its eight years of existence, the OSCE\'s
mission also had its weaknesses. For example, it lacked the necessary
staff to cover such a vast area, and at times Russia denied access to
the border area. [However, **despite these weaknesse**s, experts like
Jamie Shea --- a senior fellow at the Brussels-based independent think
tank Friends of Europe --- confirmed **the mission had \"played a useful
role** in terms of monitoring the cease-fire, recording violations,
reporting on the humanitarian situation and ringing the alarm bell if a
war was likely to restart.\"]{.underline} Grawe said that, of course,
the Ukraine monitoring mission had reported on the buildup of tensions,
particularly in the months of January and February this year. \"But the
developments that happened as of February 24 were obviously far beyond
the mission\'s mandate,\" she said. Men walk past an OSCE car damaged in
the course of Russia\'s war in Ukraine in Mariupol Many observers think
the OSCE played an important role in Ukraine right up until Russia
invaded Consensus design could promote dialogue One of the OSCE\'s key
missions is to prevent conflict and war in Europe. Did it fail? When
asked this question, Schmid said it\'s always easy to blame
international organizations. **[The OSCE offered an instrument, a
platform for dialogue]{.underline}**. \"But ultimately, we are not a
defense alliance, if there is no political will,\" she said. If one
participating state, in this case Russia, chooses force and violence
over dialogue, this is not the fault of the organization, she added.
Unsurprisingly, it was also Russia that vetoed extending the Ukraine
monitoring mission at the end of March. Due to the OSCE\'s consensus
design, a single member may block decisions taken by the 56 other
countries. This structure also makes it difficult to suspend Russia from
the organization, as it has been from other international organizations
like the Council of Europe. Even with a \"consensus minus one\"
procedure available when one member commits gross human rights
violations, Belarus would likely vote with Russia, further foiling any
such exclusion. But for many, the fact that Russia and Ukraine remain
together in this international organization has value in and of itself.
All 57 ambassadors to the OSCE continue to meet every Thursday in their
so-called permanent council. \"The OSCE is still a platform for
dialogue,\" said Shea. \"But not really with an operational role at the
moment.\" The organization has provided a platform for Russia to explain
its position to the members. And, of course, for members to express
grave concerns regarding Russia\'s invasion to Moscow via its OSCE
membership. [**OSCE\'s time will come** The OSCE traces its origins back
to the Cold War era in the 1970s, created as an attempt to improve
relations between East and West. Ever since, it has focused on issues
such as arms control, freedom of the press, human rights and free
elections. \"The hope then of a Europe free of conflict hasn\'t quite
materialized,\" admitted Schmid. \"But there are huge
achievements.\"]{.underline}

## External NB -- NATO Bad

### 2NC -- Avoids NATO Bad

[Time for OSCE to assert itself]{.underline}

[**It's time for ageing NATO to retir**e---the septuagenarian Atlantic
Treaty is **exhausted, fatigued and overworked**. Instead, the
Organisation of Security & Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is flexing its
muscles to deal with the European security, through indigenous means.
Unlike NATO, the **OSCE is made in Europe---by the Europeans and for the
Europeans.**]{.underline}

It is ready to come out of the Viennese concrete walls and act as a
powerful NEW Concert of Europe. Ambassador Helga Schmidt---current
Secretary General of the OSCE has strategic maturity, operational
clarity and human capacity to offer a better security alternative to the
Europeans than what Stoltenberg can provide. She is assertive,
knowledgeable and persuasive.

I first met young 35-36 year old Helga in the summer of 1997 when she
accompanied her boss, then German FM Klause Kinkel, who came to deliver
a talk at IISS, London. Later, I met Helga in 2013-14 in Vienna and
Geneva when she attended a number of JCPOA sessions assisting Angela
Merkel and Federica Mogherini. Ms. Schmidt played a commendable role to
make JCPOA happen in July 2015---she was dismayed when Donald Trump
withdrew from it in May 2018.

Headquartered in Vienna, [OSCE is **fully capable of dealing with
security-related issues** of all 57 members in Europe. The Europeans
need a robust Concert of Europe to **get rid of obsolete yet coercive
NATO**, for which they, since 1949, have been making regular and equal
contributions---financial, human and collateral---but no equal sharing
of its blessings.]{.underline}

Option 2: Being open to pursuing minimal cooperation Alternatively,
participating States might pursue minimal cooperation with Russia,
including by adopting the annual budget. This policy is made easier by
the OSCE rule that a decision only requires that no participating State
actively opposes the decision. As article 69 of the 1973 Final
Recommendations of the Helsinki Consultations states: "Consensus shall
be understood to mean the absence of any objection expressed by a
Representative and submitted by him as constituting an obstacle to the
taking of the decision in question." Similarly, the 2006 Rules of
Procedure allow for a so-called silence procedure for decisions by the
Permanent Council, the Forum for Security Co-operation, and the
Ministerial Council whereby a decision can be adopted if no
participating State expresses an objection to the decision within a
pre-determined period of time. [Hence, participating States could adopt
a lowest common denominator approach towards Russia: they **would be
open to adopt decisions** that Russia also supports, rather than being
against everything Russia supports and refusing to take any decisions
with Russia. This approach to critical decisions would potentially keep
the OSCE functioning.]{.underline} A similar approach was recently
adopted at the United Nations Security Council when a Presidential
Statement was issued by the Council President, Ambassador Leah
Thomas-Greenfield of the United States. Merely reminding UN member
states of their "obligation to settle their international disputes by
peaceful means", the statement also reflects the potential problems with
such an approach in potentially legitimizing Russian aggression or
creating a moral equivalence between Russia and Ukraine. It would
therefore be important to minimize any Russian legitimacy gains from
such an approach in the OSCE context by delegations walking out when
Russian delegates speak (which happened both in the Permanent Council
and in the Forum for Security Co-operation), at least when no decisions
need to be taken. Moreover, OSCE States can continue condemning Russia's
war during debates in the Permanent Council and the Forum for Security
Co-operation, and also issue interpretative statements after making
joint decisions. As part of the official record of meetings of the
Permanent Council and the Ministerial Council, such statements help
opponents of Russia's war to signal norms-based positions, also to
parliaments and the public back home. The lowest common denominator
approach could also be applied to other issues beyond the adoption of
the budget. The OSCE still does not have agreement on the
Chair-in-Office in 2024 (after Russia, late last year, blocked Estonia's
bid). Moreover, the mandates for OSCE field operations in the Western
Balkans, Moldova, and Central Asia need to be renewed by the end of the
year. Failing agreement among all 57 participating States, one option
would be to fund such missions through extrabudgetary contributions
(ExB) that do not require consensus. To be sure, Russia could then
rightly argue that these are no longer OSCE activities. Yet, ExB may be
a way to buy time. However, the lowest common denominator may be too
small to keep the OSCE going. The mandate of the Project Coordinator in
Ukraine, which now provides primarily humanitarian aid in Ukraine's
West, expires at the end of June. Russian agreement to extend the
mission is unlikely, given that Moscow pulled the plug on the
Russia-based OSCE Border Observation Mission last year and in March this
year refused to extend the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (SMM).
The OSCE might therefore soon no longer have a presence in Ukraine,
despite its contribution to mitigating some of the effects of war.
Hanging on a thread, too, is Europe's largest human rights conference.
Annually organized by ODIHR in Warsaw, the Human Dimension
Implementation Meeting was canceled in 2020 because of the COVID-19
pandemic and in 2021 because of Russian opposition. If the meeting does
not take place a third time in a row it would probably have to be
consigned to the dustbin of history. The future of ongoing OSCE
mediation efforts is unclear, too. The Geneva International Discussions
over the conflicts in Georgia (Abkhazia and South Ossetia) are on hold,
although the OSCE and EU facilitated Incident Response and Prevention
Mechanism in Ergneti has continued to meet regularly. On hold, too, is
the Minsk Group, which mediates in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh
and is co-chaired by France, Russia, and the United States. Even in
Transnistria where conflict management has looked most promising over
recent years, the OSCE's role may wane if Russia expands its war to
Moldova via Transnistria. Without agreement on HDIM, a mediation role,
and potentially some or all field operations, the OSCE could still
survive, even if in a truncated form. But time is running out and as it
does, uncertainty will increase: there is no precedent for how the
Organization would continue to function without agreement on a budget
(needed, at least according to a standard interpretation of the rules,
before the end of 2022) and on a Chair for 2024 (needed early in 2023 in
order to give the chosen state enough time to prepare). Moreover, the
mandate of the current Secretary General -- Helga Maria Schmid --
expires at the end of 2023. The prospect of a repeat of the leadership
crisis of 2020 could be the death knell of the Organization. [Thus,
there is no alternative to minimal cooperation with Russia, at least in
the form of the lowest common denominator approach to critical
decisions. The cost of legitimizing Russian aggression is relatively
minimal and outweighed by the ability to retain an organization that can
still help to reduce the risk of a wider war.]{.underline} Being
realistic about the consequences [As long as Russia is pursuing an
expansionist policy and continues to act as an imperialist and
revisionist power, deterrence and defense are reasonable responses. But
the Cold War taught us that **dialogue on mutual interests, such as
preventing avoidable wars**, is a vital complement to deterrence and
defense.]{.underline}

#### Working through the OSCE solves triggering Russia -- they are a more helpful forum for preventing conflict than NATO

**Rojansky 18** \[Matthew Rojansky, 10-17-2018, "Can a US-Russia
conflict be contained?," European Leadership Network,
https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/can-a-us-russia-conflict-be-contained/\]\\\\pairie

Bad news about the state of US-Russia relations is hardly new. Bilateral
relations are in a deep and likely enduring crisis, arguably their worst
since the early 1980s, if not 1960s. The reflexive postures of Moscow
and Washington are adversarial and distrustful on nearly every major
international issue, and poisonous domestic politics on both sides
appear to exclude any possibility of repairing ties. Most worrying is
the return to de facto military confrontation, from Northern Europe to
the Middle East, with the very real risk of escalation to an unintended
but catastrophic nuclear exchange. Russians and Americans deeply and
fundamentally disagree on a host of major issues. Washington, awaiting
the outcome of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in
the 2016 presidential election, continues to experience Russian meddling
in everything from social media trolling to real-world cloak and dagger
escapades. [Russians have fired back with old tropes about US
imperialism and hostile NATO encirclement, but also with novelties such
as the claim that a US-funded bioweapons lab in the Republic of Georgia
killed 73 people.\[1\] Both sides have embraced sanctions, mutual
isolation, and information warfare as if they are cost-free, with the
result being that trade and exchanges between the two countries have
collapsed. Disagreements over regional conflicts now extend to a global
posture of mutual counterbalancing and containment, reminiscent of the
Cold War. Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for Donbas
separatism has become the new dividing line within Europe, with millions
displaced, tens of thousands dead, and nearly zero prospect of a
peaceful resolution on the horizon.]{.underline} In Syria, Russia has
effectively ended US aspirations for a transition from Assad's bloody
regime to electoral democracy, while empowering Iran and its proxies on
the border with US ally, Israel. This military intervention has upended
the politics and security relations of the Middle East, reviving the
half-century-old prospect of "superpower rivalries" in that crucial,
explosive and energy-rich region.

Commentary

"Pro-Russian"? "Anti-Russian"? On the futility of labels

The atmosphere surrounding Russia-US ties even has attributes of a
1950's-style Red Scare on one side, and a Stalinist hunt for foreign
agents and saboteurs on the other. In addition to the US Justice
Department's documented charges against Russian intelligence operatives,
dozens if not hundreds of cases of alleged Russian influence operations
have been uncovered amid a feeding frenzy of congressional, press, and
social media alarm ringing. These have generated lists upon lists of
potential sanctions targets, provoking a predictable panic among US and
international banks and businesses with exposure to Russian money.
Putin's own crusade to repatriate Russian wealth and expunge foreign
backing for Russian NGOs has been underway for years but has hardened to
diamond strength under the relentless pressure of US sanctions. [Amid
all this hostility, how might the basic **infrastructure of US-Russian
engagement be restored**, and to what end? While Putin himself may still
welcome summit meetings with his American counterpart, he is likely to
reject a closer partnership with the West based on his abiding distrust
of US intentions.]{.underline} Yet in this reflexive hostility, Putin
does not fully represent his 145 million Russian citizens. Trade, travel
and exchanges with China may be up, but Russians are overwhelmingly
still oriented toward Europe and the United States in their most basic
cultural and historical narratives. These deeply felt links with Western
civilization are an opening for Russia to re-engage with the Western-led
international system if leaders on both sides can find ways to manage
the issues that divide them. There are no easy wins on the US-Russia
agenda, which is why up to now the sides have mostly repeated mutual
accusations on Ukraine, election interference and other disagreements.
But as long as these disputes foreclose dialogue, opportunities for
progress in other areas will be missed. Consider a handful of such
opportunities, which might offer a way forward. Firstly, on nuclear arms
control: Russia poses a non-negligible military threat to NATO allies in
Eastern Europe, especially the Baltic States, and so the enhanced
forward posture of US and Allied forces in that region is justified as a
signal of Alliance solidarity. However, the greatest threat from Russia
comes from its nuclear capability---it is the only force able to
threaten the total destruction of the United States and Europe, and the
risk of nuclear escalation grows with each sabre-rattling gesture on
each side. President Trump was thus right to call for renewed arms
control negotiations to put a stop to the current arms race. Nuclear
arms control efforts between the US and Russia have the added benefit of
rebuilding institutionalised channels of communication, giving the
Russians a positive stake in more stable overall relations, and
signalling to third countries that the world's two big nuclear powers
are serious about risk reduction. This last point is especially
important given Washington hopes to build wider international support
for its approaches to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear problems.
Commentary

Russia-West relations in the age of fragmentation

[Secondly, on broadening the scope and participants of the
dialogue]{.underline}: Current US and European sanctions on Russia have
undoubtedly had a punishing impact on the Russian economy, but at the
same time, opportunities to engage the private sector and technical
experts from both countries in solving shared problems have been too
often overlooked. For example, Russian and US negotiators have so far
tip-toed around vital but difficult topics like setting rules for
interstate cyber conflict, countering the rise of radicalization via
cyberspace, and increasing transparency and accountability around
advanced biotechnology. Private sector actors on both sides would have
considerable interest in advancing these dialogues, which might take
place within what Trump and Putin called in Helsinki a "working group"
of Russian and American business leaders. The surrounding domestic
politics are atrocious and sanctions cast a pall over discussions
generally, but Washington has enough additional positive and negative
arrows in its quiver to seek much more from U.S.-Russia dialogue. [A
final missed opportunity, one especially important for the West to
signal interest in engagement with the **whole of Russia beyond Putin,
is the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).** The
OSCE embodies the values and legacy of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act and
the 1990 Charter of Paris -- monumental deals that facilitated the Cold
War's **peaceful end**. Yet the **OSCE's most visible roles** today are
its election observer missions and special monitoring mission in
Ukraine, and the Organisation's centrepiece, the Permanent Council in
Vienna, at which all 57 participating states are represented, has become
little more than an echo chamber for mutual recriminations. Now is the
time for jump-starting meaningful dialogue between Russians and
Americans, with Ecuropeans at the table--- on this, a hopeful sign
underway in the OSCE's Structured Dialogue initiative aimed at exploring
foundational questions about **threat perceptions and conflict
resolution**]{.underline}. As a recent speech by Vice President Mike
Pence underscored,\[2\] the US and China appear to be heading for
breaking point after only a few years of uncomfortable coexistence as
the world's dominant economies, with China closing in on US military
power. The addition of a provoked Beijing to the current dead-end
US-Russian conflict is not likely to benefit US, or European, interests.
[The **window for getting US-Russia relations back on track** is closing
before our eyes, and missing it may be the definitive end to the
relative peace and prosperity of the post-Cold War era.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AT: Russia Bad -- OSCE

#### Effective relations with Russia are key to an effective OSCE

is the Head of Centre for OSCE Research (CORE)\>\>, \<\<Stefan is a

https://www.shrmonitor.org/options-for-dealing-with-russia-in-the-osce/\]\\\\pairie

Option 1: Not taking decisions with Russia anymore One way of solving
the dilemma would be a refusal by other participating States, in
cooperation with Ukraine, to take decisions jointly with Russia. The
[most aggressive version of this policy would be to declare that Russia
is suspended from the OSCE]{.underline}. This would mirror Russia's
suspension from the UN Human Rights Council and its expulsion from the
Council of Europe. The OSCE's predecessor, the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), also offers lessons for sanctioning
norm violators. In October 1991, in Moscow, CSCE States agreed on
allowing missions of independent experts to investigate violations of
human dimension commitments, if necessary without the consent of the
accused state (the "Moscow Mechanism"). The mechanism has only been used
ten times over the past three decades---and was activated most recently
by 45 participating States in the context of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, resulting in a highly critical expert report on violations of
international humanitarian law and international human rights law.
Potentially also relevant is the 1992 decision of the CSCE to suspend
the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and
Montenegro) for the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was
based on a decision at the Prague Council Meeting in January 1992 to
allow for political steps to be taken "in the absence of the consent of
the State concerned, in cases of clear, gross and uncorrected violations
of relevant CSCE commitments." Yugoslavia was only readmitted in 2000,
after the end of the Milošević regime, and after the Yugoslav government
committed to respect OSCE principles and standards. There is even a
provision for consensus-minus-two. In Stockholm in December 1992, the
CSCE added provisions to the so-called Valletta Mechanism, to direct two
participating States engaged in a dispute to seek conciliation.
[Unfortunately, these mechanisms are not a panacea for dealing with
Russia now.]{.underline} Consensus-minus-two was never used because the
provisions are complicated and politically contested. With regard to the
suspension of Belgrade: Yugoslavia at the time had no strong allies and
was not a powerful participating State, in contrast to Russia. There
were also doubts whether the suspension was legally and politically
warranted. Moreover, the early 1990s were the heydays of the
Organization when states created rules that lost traction shortly
afterwards. Thus, the 2006 Rules of Procedure above all stress the
consensus principle, which goes back to the 1973 Final Recommendations
of the Helsinki Consultations. If the West now tried to apply mechanisms
limiting the consensus rule, Russia would most likely argue that the
West had destroyed the OSCE by violating one of its core principles.
Moscow could also be prompted to withdraw from the OSCE itself. As an
indication of its insistence on consensus, Russia called the Human
Dimension mechanisms "outdated and redundant for the most part" after
the recent activation of the Moscow Mechanism. [More important than this
formalistic perspective: without Russia, the **OSCE would lose much of
its purpose.**]{.underline} [The permanent **security dialogue** between
Western states and Russia is a unique value of the OSCE]{.underline}. To
be sure, Russia's annexation of Crimea and its intervention in the
Donbas in 2014 reduced dialogue in the Vienna conference halls to mutual
accusations. One of the victims was conventional arms control and
military transparency. For example, Russia refused for years to update
the 2011 Vienna Document, which provides among other measures for mutual
inspections. Russia's aggression against Ukraine on 24 February has
reinforced the policy of Western participating States and their allies
of "no business as usual", in place since 2014. Nevertheless, even
meetings where diplomats ritualistically present antagonistic positions
are valuable at a time when there is a serious risk of a war between
Russia and NATO states. The original aim of such meetings -- to build
trust -- now seems naive, but simply informing the other side of one's
position helps to channel information to the 57 capitals and avoid
misunderstandings that could spiral into nuclear war. [Taking decisions
without Russia, and thus effectively suspending Russia from the OSCE,
may also not be effective in ensuring the Organization's
survival.]{.underline} Moscow's allies, above all Belarus and
potentially Armenia (which depends on Russia keeping Azerbaijan at bay)
and Tajikistan (which has a Russian military base on its territory),
could still frustrate decision-making. In addition, should Russia
formally leave the OSCE, its allies would likely follow suit, as might
other participating States sharing the Kremlin's concerns about OSCE
support to democratization, such as Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and
Tajikistan. The result would be a rump OSCE. If the nationalist Serbian
government joined the Russian camp, the OSCE would lose much of its
still significant remit in the Western Balkans, too. Participating
States could also sideline Russia without formally suspending Russia.
Delegations could refuse to sit in meetings with Russian diplomats,
similar to Ukraine's decision not to attend any meeting of the Forum for
Security Cooperation between April and July when Belarus chairs the
Forum. They could also set up alternative meetings where they take
decisions without Russia. The Rules of Procedure allow the
Chairperson-in-Office, the Chair of the Forum for Security Co-operation,
or an executive structure (such as the Secretariat) to organize events
without agreement from all participating States. But such events, unless
based on a consensus decision, are not official OSCE events, and
documents adopted at such events do not count as OSCE documents and
therefore lack normative traction. [Hence, there are **no tricks for
bypassing the consensus rule**. Any attempt to do so would risk the
survival of the OSCE.]{.underline}

NATO, with a total of 30 member states, and the EU, consisting of 27,

### 2AC -- INB -- No Moldova Impact 

#### No Moldova impact -- Russia won't invade they have already sustained heavy losses

[How likely is a Russian advance toward the region?]{.underline}

[**Not very**, analysts say.]{.underline}

Russia has reoriented its military efforts on gaining control of the
Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, after attempts to seize Kyiv, the
capital, and broader swaths of Ukraine failed. [The Russian military has
**sustained heavy losses** during its two-month assault and significant
battlefield reversals that surprised many observers and exposed its
weaknesses.]{.underline}

"The conversation about Transnistria is a complete canard," said Michael
Kofman, a Russia expert at CNA, a nonprofit research and analysis
organization in Arlington, Va. ["The Russian military has **no capacity
for this kind of offensive**. It's very likely that they will be a spent
force after the offensive in Donbas."]{.underline}

Kofman said the statement from Minnekaev, the Russian commander, that
Moscow intended to take control of southern Ukraine wasn't new. "They
literally tried this in phase one," he said.

Russian attempts to advance beyond the southern Ukrainian city of
Mykolaiv made little headway, leaving southwestern Ukraine under Kyiv's
control.

Moldova's foreign minister, Nicu Popescu, said at an event hosted by the
German Marshall Fund in Washington this week that [the situation in
Transnistria is "more or less calm" and that Moldova had not seen signs
of any unusual military activity there.]{.underline}

[The OSCE participated in the settlement of the Transnistrian conflict
**once its most acute phase** had been **overcome.**]{.underline} In
particular, the organisation was puzzled by the signing of a ceasefire
agreement and the establishment of the Joint Control Commission (JCC),
consisting of representatives of the armed forces of Moldova, Russia and
the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. According to its mandate, the
mission should assist in laying the groundwork for dialogue between
Chisinau and Tiraspol, collecting information about the situation in the
region, providing consultations, and encouraging negotiations on the
conclusion of an agreement on the status of the PMR and the withdrawal
of foreign troops. Late in 1999, the mandate of the OSCE mission was
expanded with the additional task of "ensuring transparency of the
removal and destruction of Russian ammunition and armaments".

The participation of the OSCE mission in the settlement of the crisis is
ensured both through observers and through involvement in the
negotiation process. The OSCE, along with Russia and Ukraine, is a
guarantor of the 5+2 format. Over 28 years, the mission has helped to
resolve a number of issues, including the opening of traffic on the
bridge across the Dnieper River near the village of Gura Bîcului,
providing Moldovan farmers with access to plots in the Dubăsari District
of Transnistria, recognition of documents and license plates, etc.
[However, one **cannot speak of a substantial intermediary contribution
by the OSCE** to the conflict resolution process. Progress in this
process can only be achieved by changing the policies of the leading
actors. Thus, the proposals of the mission representatives on possible
ways out of the crisis **did not find support** in Chisinau and
Tiraspol]{.underline} (1993 Report No. 13 by T. Williams, Head of

### 2AC -- INB -- OSCE Fails

#### It fails -- every country has an effective veto power which makes punishing aggressors impossible 

**Garibov 16** \[Azad Garibov, 05-11-2016, "Why the OSCE Keeps Failing
to Make Peace in Nagorno-Karabakh, The National Interest,
[https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-osce-keeps-failing-make-peace-nagorno-karabakh-16161\]\\\\pairie](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-osce-keeps-failing-make-peace-nagorno-karabakh-16161%5d\\pairie)

Above all, it should be noted that the OSCE is an intergovernmental
organization with no supranational powers. [This intergovernmentalism
means that any OSCE activity in any member country, and any mission
deployed on behalf of the organization, is subject to unanimous approval
from all member states, and particularly the country to which the
activity or mission pertains. Thus, every country in the organization
has an **effective veto power** on any decision]{.underline}. In 1996
the OSCE was unable to include the famous "three principles" (the
territorial integrity of both countries, self-determination for
Nagorno-Karabakh in the form of the highest degree of self-rule within
Azerbaijan, and guaranteed security for Nagorno-Karabakh and its whole
population) in the Lisbon declaration due to Armenia's objection,
despite winning the support of 53 out of 54 member states. [This
**essential systemic weakness** constrains the OSCE's effectiveness in
many cases, including in conflict areas when there is need **to punish
aggressors** and protect victims.]{.underline}

In considering shortcomings peculiar to Minsk Group itself, the biggest
problem is that it tries not to hurt anyone. The Minsk Group tries to
seem neutral, and this near-obsession with neutrality does not allow it
to be fair and impartial. It is claimed that openly naming Armenia as an
aggressor country and calling for the fulfillment of U.N. Security
Council resolutions---which entails unconditional withdrawal of forces
from Nagorno-Karabakh---might discredit the OSCE Minsk group in the eyes
of Armenian side. However, it does not mean that OSCE can play this game
of neutrality over justice forever. The Minsk Group's co-chairs avoid
making clear-cut statements about their positions on Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict. They avoid bringing up the fact of occupation; they make
general and vague statements at best, or indeed make contradictory
declarations depending on whether they are in Baku or Yerevan. In so
doing, they claim that they are addressing the resolution of the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, when there is need for a firm
position, the co-chairs state that Armenia and Azerbaijan should find a
solution themselves since it is their problem, and that the Minsk Group
will support any decision they make. This attitude and the visible
failure of shuttle diplomacy has resulted in such widespread distrust in
OSCE Minsk Group's activity that the Azerbaijani media has begun to
re­fer to the co-chairs' visits to the region as "tourist excursions."

[The **lack of interest** and consequent **lack of commitment** on the
part of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chair countries to the resolution
process is another visible setback]{.underline}. The co-chairs seem to
be dealing much more with "conflict management"---trying to reduce the
tensions between parties via occasional visits to re­gion---than with a
"conflict resolution mechanism". The Minsk group has monopolized the
resolution process of the conflict, but lacks the needed commitment to
push the process forward. This lack of commitment is also seen in the
form of the low level of involvement by co-chair countries in the
resolution process. The involvement of more mid- or high-level diplomats
and politicians might prove effective in accelerating the peace process.
Talks that carry high-level international commitment---such as the 2001
Key West negotiations, which involved the US president George
Bush---might be a necessary change, given that this low-profile shuttle
diplomacy seems to be failing. History shows that when major powers are
interested and committed, they are able to facilitate effective
negotiations to find a solution to the complex conflicts similar to
Nagorno-Karabakh. To give comparable examples, during the bloody
dissolution of Yugoslavia, the U.S. commitment and appointment of a
special representative was key in hammering out the 1995 Dayton
Agreement, while French president Jacques Chirac's personal involvement
played the same role in reaching the 1999 Rambouillet Accords.

Moreover, if in the beginning OSCE involvement as a mediator was
intended to represent impartial international involvement, [today the
OSCE Minsk Group's approach is a troika-based approach rather than a
genuine and inclusive OSCE approach. The OSCE seems to have **little
influence over the Minsk Group**; three chair states are in a full
control of the process.]{.underline} On top of that, the three members
of troika have their own divergent positions on the peace process, which
further hampers the prospect of successful negotiations. Russia has
frequently sought to dominate the process, while the United States
increased its attention when its stakes rose in the South Caucasus.
Moreover, the domestic considerations of these three countries also play
a certain role in their approach to the peace process and conflict
parties. The three co-chair countries are home to the largest,
wealthiest and best-organized Armenian diasporas. For instance, at the
beginning of the 1990s, the Armenian lobby managed to block U.S.
financial support to Azerbaijan under the "Free­dom Support Act" (FSA)
program; in addition, the US ambassadorial nominee to Azerbaijan in 2010
was blocked by influential senators representing U.S. states with
powerful Armenian communities. It should also be noted that Moscow is
Yerevan's closest strategic ally, and Armenia is frequently claimed to
have de facto protectorate-metropolis relations with Russia.

#### OSCE structurally fails -- deep internal divisions and political crises can't be resolved by the counterplan

**Günther 22** \[Mirco Günther, 02-15-2022, "We have an institution to
ensure peace in Europe," \<\<Mirco heads the FES Regional Office in
Asia\>\>, IPS,

[The OSCE is mired in **permanent crisis, verging on paralysis.**
Because of the OSCE's **deep internal divisions and the prevailing
consensus rule,** however, far-reaching decisions are rather the
exception. When they do happen, OSCE decisions carry considerable
normative weight -- as with the establishment of the OSCE monitoring
mission at the onset of the Ukraine crisis in 2014.]{.underline} Sadly,
such diplomatic success stories are rare. The OSCE is mired in permanent
crisis, verging on paralysis. The Swedish chairmanship in 2021 ended
with few substantive achievements. The OSCE-hosted Human Dimension
Implementation Meeting, Europe's largest human rights conference, was
blocked by Russia. Election monitoring missions are regularly disputed.
Agreements are reached only with great difficulty, if at all, even on
largely operational matters, such as the annual budget or the agenda for
the annual security conference. In 2020, the Organization stared into
the abyss when, in an unprecedented leadership crisis, its four most
important posts lay vacant for several months, including that of
secretary general. What is the OSCE? All these challenges stem from
fundamental differences concerning the OSCE's core purpose. Western
states emphasise the Organization's uniquely comprehensive approach to
security, encompassing political-military, economic, environmental, and
human rights issues, which emerged from Helsinki. A number of eastern
participating countries have strong reservations about its human rights
agenda. If the OSCE were to be founded today, it is almost inconceivable
that an agreement could be reached on its very principles, including the
Paris Charter for Europe's post-Cold War order. Over the years, there
have been more than one attempt to bring about meaningful reforms, but
to little avail. It seems unlikely that future OSCE chairs will have
more success: Poland this year, followed by North Macedonia, Estonia (to
be confirmed) and Finland. The price of peace Many actors bear
responsibility for the OSCE's sorry state. [Moscow, for example, has
repeatedly weakened OSCE mandates and operational capabilities, while at
the same time lamenting the Organization's lacking relevance. Countries
like Armenia and Azerbaijan often **obstruct even** the **simplest
decisions on procedural matters**, following a logic of national
rivalry.]{.underline} Various host countries have limited the mandates
of OSCE field operations, although it needs to be recognised that this
is their sovereign right. Western countries, too, have sold the OSCE
short, preferring other organisations or bilateral formats. Moreover,
many states continue to prioritise austerity policies and fail to give
the Organization the financial resources it needs. The presence of
unarmed international observers along the contact line in Eastern
Ukraine has made a significant difference. At the same time, there is
rarely any other organisation in the world that offers security at a
more reasonable price. Its regular annual budget of around €138 million
is modest by international standards. The Ukraine observation mission
has a separate budget of around €100 million. In 2020, the OSCE had more
than 3,500 staff from 51 countries in 20 locations. Its achievements are
considerable, as the Ukraine conflict highlights. A key role in Ukraine
The presence of unarmed international observers along the contact line
in Eastern Ukraine has made a significant difference, albeit often far
away from public awareness. Local Ukrainians have worked side by side
with Americans, Russians, and Europeans. According to a report by the
observers, between July 2019 and October 2021 the OSCE mediated more
than 3,000 local ceasefires. Repair works on critical water and
electricity infrastructure have given millions of civilians access to
fundamental services. In publicly available daily reports, the OSCE
documents compliance (and any non-compliance) with the 2015 Minsk
Protocol and is an indispensable neutral voice on the ground. With this
in mind, it is greatly worrying that some participating states have
decided to pull out their observers fearing further escalation. There
are a number of reasons why the OSCE's important work does not receive
broader attention. For one thing, its observers are often subjected to
obstructions. They are denied access to the relevant regions and sites,
their freedom of movement is restricted, and OSCE unmanned aerial drones
are interfered with or shot down. The Organization registered a total of
93,902 ceasefire violations in 2021, which exceeds its capacity to
broker ceasefires many times. Moreover, given the current geopolitical
dynamics and fast-paced high-level diplomacy on the world stage, the
often cumbersome de-escalation work in the very conflict zone tends to
get less attention. A future platform for European security In light of
all this, what role can the OSCE play in pursuit of a future European
security order? As in any organisation, this ultimately comes down to
the political will of the participating states. [A number of OSCE key
actors currently exhibit a **lack of such will**. As things stand, the
most obvious approach -- namely not to re-invent the wheel but to dust
off the organisation and reinvigorate it -- is therefore hardly an
option.]{.underline} In the long run, however, we will need a joint
platform for European security. [The crisis of the OSCE is not of
operational or technical nature, but deeply political]{.underline}.
Needless to say that this is profoundly regrettable, given its unique
wealth of experience in early warning and conflict prevention, as well
as crisis management and resolution, and its tried-and-tested toolbox of
confidence-building measures -- among them the mechanism about 'unusual
military activities' under the OSCE Vienna Document Ukraine is using to
seek clarification from Russia.

### 2AC -- INB -- OSCE Fails -- Ukraine

#### OSCE is a complete failure -- an OSCE state has invading Ukraine proves 

**Bloed 22** \[Arie Bloed, 02-25-2022, "Is this the death of the OSCE
Decalogue?", Security and Human Rights Monitor,
https://www.shrmonitor.org/is-this-the-death-of-the-osce-decalogue/\]\\\\pairie

[At the same time it also means that an organization like the OSCE has
**failed in all respects** to ensure the fulfillment of its key
function, i.e. ensuring a stable environment in the OSCE area through
its cooperative and comprehensive security approac]{.underline}h. In
particular in the post-Cold War period the OSCE became an impressive
'community of values' and 'community of responsibility'. At the Astana
Summit, just 11 years ago, there was even talk of a joint vision of a
Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security. By adhering to a constantly
developing number of basic norms and values in the OSCE region, the
East-West divide turned into a region with largely common norms and
values, not only in the area of peace and security, but also in the
areas of the human and the economic and environmental dimensions.

What is more, OSCE participating states did not only aim at the
development of a highly sophisticated system of norms and rules, but
also at a system that aimed at providing each other support, whenever
countries were considered to be in need of help. [This 'joint
responsibility' for the fulfilment of the basic norms and standards,
based on the idea of "indivisible security" has been fatally affected in
the case of the Russian military attack against Ukraine since a key
**OSCE state refused to comply** with the most fundamental rules which
it had helped create itself.]{.underline}

[The 'community of responsibility', however, is also **largely ignored
by the other OSCE** states, which of course are competing with each
other in condemning the Russian actions in words, but at the same time
refusing to provide meaningful help to the Ukrainian government and
people by only imposing non-military sanctions. Furthermore, there were
few serious attempts within the OSCE during the past few months and
years to move beyond **stubborn public diplomacy** to real negotiations
on resolving the crisis in and around Ukraine.]{.underline} Also this
behavior has made the community of responsibility as a core element of
the OSCE philosophy of promoting peace and security in the Eurasian area
void of a substantial meaning. If a partner such as Ukraine which is
overrun by a much more powerful army by another OSCE state and then is
largely left on its own, the philosophy of a 'family of nations' has
been totally undermined.

The Russian occupation of the Crimea in 2014 was already a clear sign
that the Russian Federation was acting in violation of the most
fundamental principles of international law, but at least it still made
an effort to show that it felt obliged to take these principles
seriously, for instance through the organization of a (fraudulent)
referendum about Crimea joining the Russian territory as an act of
'self-determination'. In the case of the war against Ukraine the Russian
authorities are going further by not even making a serious effort
anymore to reconcile their military acts with the 'law book'.

Instead it is playing now by the old-fashioned, 19th-century book of
power politics and geographical expansionism to ensure its 'national
security', no longer hindered by legal niceties such as principles of
non-aggression, inviolability of borders or non-interference in internal
affairs -- principles that were already enshrined in the UN Charter to
save future generations from the scourge of war.

The result is that the European continent (and the world) has been
thrown back into a political nightmare where the carefully developed
checks and balances in the volatile international security system have
been discarded and where the world has been thrown back in a security
jungle where power politics has taken over from basic principles and
norms. The damage caused by this unilateral Russian action goes way
beyond the bilateral Russian-Ukrainian relation and is dangerously
undermining the whole system which has given Europe a longer period of
peace than ever before.

[Although the OSCE has achieved a lot over the past decades, in
particular also in the most challenging environments, the open Russian
aggression against a neighbouring country is the most serious crisis
which the OSCE has faced in its existence. As a matter of fact, the
basis on which the organization has been functioning has been largely
taken away.]{.underline}

[Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is a vital test for the
OSCE]{.underline}. For many years the OSCE has been seen as failing to
prevent or de-escalate (not to even mention sustainably settle)
conflicts in Europe. It now needs to be united and deliver feasible
results to remain a useful element of European security. However, its
activity in Ukraine from 2014 until 24 February 2022 was also partially
successful in organizational terms. It is worthy of astonishment how
swiftly the OSCE succeeded in reorienting its country office and
launched its special monitoring mission (SMM) in Ukraine in 2014. For
those eight years the SMM was mostly an effective tool for many
de-escalatory efforts and a number of successful solutions were
implemented to tackle problems on the line of contact. But these
successes were not enough and were underpinned by a lack of political
backing in Vienna, due to growing political drifts and conflicts among
some participating States, as well as a number of problems with
efficiency at the Secretariat level. [This assessment does not deny the
efforts undertaken by OSCE institutions or the Secretariat, but mainly
refers to the tempo and quality of reactions to **negative developments
in and around Ukraine**. The quite destructive role of a number of OSCE
participating States that wanted to **block some productive
initiatives** also needs to be recognized. Many of the problems relate
to the lack of adequate institutional capacity of the OSCE, because
participating States for many years could not agree on necessary
reforms, tolerating possible **inefficiencies** of the OSCE in critical
situations. Therefore, Ukraine doubts that the OSCE can help settle the
war and conflict with Russia]{.underline}. This negative attitude is
less visible by people or organizations who have co-operated with the
OSCE in different formats or been confronted with its activities -- they
have had possibilities to see the concrete impact of OSCE activities[.
However, the OSCE has not sufficiently promoted its results (even if
moderate) and their practical value to key stakeholders inside Ukraine,
especially to wider Ukrainian society.]{.underline} On the other hand
Ukrainian authorities and society have expected much more clarity (i.e.
on stating the facts and identifying the perpetrators without using
general diplomatic phrases) and prompt reaction from OSCE
representatives (either in the SMM or the office in Kyiv) to the
violations from the Russian side (including its puppets in Donetsk and
Luhansk). It may be these expectations were too high for OSCE staff
because of the Organization's general policy to be viewed as a neutral
and impartial actor (in order to keep Russia on board), but this also
damaged the Organization's image.
