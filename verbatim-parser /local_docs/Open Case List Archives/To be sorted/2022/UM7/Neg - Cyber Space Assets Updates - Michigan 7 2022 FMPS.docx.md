[International cooperation in space has rarely resulted in
cost-effective or expedient solutions, especially in politically-charged
areas of uncertain technological feasibility.]{.underline} The
International Space Station, because of both political and technical
setbacks, has taken over two decades to deploy and cost many billions of
dollars---far more time and money than was originally intended. [Space
debris mitigation has also encountered aversion in international
forums.]{.underline} The topic was brought up in COPUOS as early as
1980, yet a policy failed to develop despite a steady flow of documents
on the increasing danger of space debris (Perek 1991). In fact, COPUOS
did not adopt debris mitigation guidelines until 2007 and, even then,
they were legally non-binding.

[Space [debris removal]{.mark} systems [could take **decades**]{.mark}
to develop and deploy [through international partnerships]{.mark} due to
the many interdisciplinary challenges they face. Given the need to start
actively removing space debris sooner rather than later to ensure the
continued benefits of satellite services, **[international cooperation
may not be]{.mark} the most [appropriate]{.mark} mechanism for
instigating the first space debris removal system**.]{.underline}
Instead, [[one country should]{.mark} take a [lead]{.mark}ership role by
establishing a national space debris removal program. This would
**accelerate technology development and demonstration**, which would, in
turn, **[build]{.mark}-up [trust]{.mark}** [and **hasten international
participation**]{.mark} in space debris removal.]{.underline}

Possibilities of Leadership

As previously discussed, a recent NASA study found that [[annually
removing]{.mark} as little as [five]{.mark} massive [pieces of
debris]{.mark} in critical orbits [could]{.mark} significantly
[stabilize]{.mark} the long-term [space]{.mark} debris
environment]{.underline} (Liou and Johnson 2007). [This suggests that
**it is feasible for one nation to unilaterally develop and deploy an
effective debris removal system.** As the United States is responsible
for creating much of the debris in Earth's orbit, it is a candidate for
taking a leadership role in removing it]{.underline}, along with other
heavy polluters of the space environment such as China and Russia.

There are several reasons why the United States should take this
leadership role, rather than China or Russia. First and foremost, the
United States would be hardest hit by the loss of satellites services.
It owns about half of the roughly 800 operating satellites in orbit and
its military is significantly more dependent upon them than any other
entity (Moore 2008). For example, GPS precision-guided munitions are a
key component of the "new American way of war" (Dolman 2006, 163-165),
which allows the United States to remain a globally dominant military
power while also waging war in accordance with its political and ethical
values by enabling faster, less costly war fighting with minimal
collateral damage (Sheldon 2005). The U.S. Department of Defense
recognized the need to protect U.S. satellite systems over ten years ago
when it stated in its 1999 Space Policy that, "the ability to access and
utilize space is a vital national interest because many of the
activities conducted in the medium are critical to U.S. national
security and economic well-being" (U.S. Department of Defense 1999, 6).
Clearly, the United States has a vested interest in keeping the
near-Earth space environment free from threats like space debris and
thus assuring U.S. access to space.

Moreover, current U.S. National Space Policy asserts that [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates will take a "[leadership
role]{.mark}" in space debris minimization. This [could include]{.mark}
the [**development, deployment, and demonstration**]{.mark} of an
effective space debris removal system to remove U.S. debris as well as
that of other nations, upon their request. There could also be
international political and economic advantages associated with being
the first country to develop this revolutionary technology]{.underline}.
However, there is always the danger of other nations simply benefiting
from U.S. investment of its resources in this area. Thus, [mechanisms
should also be created to avoid a classic "free rider" situation. For
example, techniques could be employed to ensure other countries either
join in the effort later on or pay appropriate fees to the United States
for removal services]{.underline}.

Recommendations for Leadership in Space Debris Removal

Going forward, [[the]{.mark} U.S. [government should engage the
commercial sector in space debris removal]{.mark}. **[Government
contracts]{.mark}** with several commercial firms would create a
competitive environment, encouraging innovation and cost minimization.
Having several companies working on the problem at the same time would
also accelerate remediation as several critical orbits could be
addressed at once]{.underline}. Furthermore, [early investments in a
domestic space debris removal industry would give the United States a
head start in what may become a critical industry over the coming
decades.]{.underline}

The aforementioned 2009 International Conference on Orbital Debris
Removal, co-hosted by DARPA and NASA, suggests that these two agencies
could lead U.S. government efforts in space debris removal. However, it
is important to recognize that DARPA and NASA are driven by very
different motives: one is a civilian space agency, while the other is a
defense research agency. Failure to appreciate these differences when
establishing mission requirements could lead to a situation like that of
the National Polar Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), where the
attempt to combine civil and military requirements into a single
satellite resulted in doubling project costs, a launch delay of five
years, and ultimately splitting the project into two separate programs
(Clark 2010). Furthermore, any system developed through a joint
NASA-DARPA partnership would need to be transferred to an operational
agency, as both NASA and DARPA are research and development entities.
The U.S. Air Force, as it is the primary agency responsible for national
security space operations, is a possible option.

Funding the development of a national space debris removal system
carries risks because, due to the nascent state of the field, detailed
cost-benefit estimates have not yet been carried out. The Space Frontier
Foundation, however, proposes that [[the government should]{.mark}
[establish **special funds**]{.mark} [at the expense of parties who
generate debris]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dunstan and Werb 2009). [Suggested
mechanisms for raising the funds include charging fees for U.S. launches
based on the debris potential of the mission, with the size of the fee
determined by relevant factors such as the mass of the anticipated
debris resulting from the mission and the congestion of the orbit into
which the space object is being launched. Satellite manufacturers,
operators, and service providers could all share responsibility for
payment into such funds. Once debris removal systems are in operation,
additional funds could also come from service fees.]{.underline} For
example, [entities that created debris could pay a specified amount to
removal providers in return for the service rendered]{.underline}.

[Any national space debris removal program must also be kept transparent
with ongoing international dialogue in forums such as COPUOS so that
other nations can build-up trust in the effectiveness and efficiency of
the program. A proven debris removal program will result in more
productive discussions in these international forums.]{.underline}

VII\. Conclusion

If the United States and other powerful governments do not take steps
now to avert the potentially devastating effects of space debris, the
issue risks becoming stalemated in a manner similar to climate change.
Given the past hesitation of international forums in addressing the
space debris issue, **[unilateral action is the most appropriate means
of instigating space debris removal within the needed timeframe. The
United States is well poised for a leadership role in space debris
removal.]{.underline}**

[Going forward, the U.S. government should work closely with the
commercial sector in this endeavor, focusing on removing pieces of U.S.
debris with the greatest potential to contribute to future collisions.
It should also keep its space debris removal system as open and
transparent as possible to allow for future international cooperation in
this field.]{.underline}

Although leadership in space debris removal will entail certain risks,
investing early in preserving the near-Earth space environment is
necessary to protect the satellite technology that is so vital to the
U.S. military and day-to-day operations of the global economy. By
instituting global space debris removal measures, a critical opportunity
exists to mitigate and minimize the potential damage of space debris and
ensure the sustainable development of the near-Earth space environment.

The [[l]{.mark}ow [E]{.mark}arth [o]{.mark}rbit debris environment
continues to be a concern for the space community]{.underline}. While
[[debris mitigation]{.mark} [is]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} component
of reducing on-orbit clutter, [active **debris removal methods
are**]{.mark} likely to be **[necessary]{.mark}** in the
future.]{.underline} The [AVS Lab is studying a debris [removal]{.mark}
concept which aims to [deorbit]{.mark} [existing]{.mark} defunct [large
rocket bodies]{.mark} by considering small modifications to existing
launch vehicles]{.underline}. The following concept is being proposed by
Dr. V. Trushlyakov of Omsk State Technical University. [Post-mission
fuel reserves from the second stage of a heavy launch vehicle are used
to rendezvous with an existing rocket body debris object]{.underline}.
Upon tethering to this debris, a Delta-v maneuver is performed with the
remaining fuel reserves to lower both objects\' periapses. Specifically,
in current study, [a **[Soyuz-like rocket-body]{.mark}** is considered
the thrusting tug craft, while a Cosmos-3M rocket-body [is]{.mark}
considered [the debris object]{.mark}.]{.underline} To deorbit a
Cosmos-3M in 25 years from an 800 km orbit only requires a combined
Delta-v of 120 m/s. This is within the fuel reserve budget of the Soyuz
upper stage, illustrating the feasibility of this approach.
[[In [order](https://hanspeterschaub.info/research-ADR.html) to avoid
collision]{.mark} between the two craft, deep-space dynamics reveal that
the thrust can be throttled in synchronization with the relative motion
so that, at the end of a burn, zero relative velocity between the two
craft is achieved.]{.underline} The on-[orbit dynamics reveal that the
orbital motion helps keep both craft separated]{.underline}. Our
research [group](https://hanspeterschaub.info/research-ADR.html) is
collaborating with Omsk State University by investigating the complex
relative dynamics once the two large, [rigid bodies are tethered to each
other, and the [deorbiting]{.mark} burns are [engaged]{.mark}. Studying
the dynamics, and the thruster control solutions, methods are
[being]{.mark} investigated to ensure the robustness of [this
ADR]{.mark} [system]{.mark}.]{.underline}
