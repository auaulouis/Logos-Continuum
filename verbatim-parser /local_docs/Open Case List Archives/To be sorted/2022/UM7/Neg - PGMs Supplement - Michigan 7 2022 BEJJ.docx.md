### 2NC -- Aid Bad -- Ukraine

#### US aid specifically to Ukraine makes it worse -- justifies more interventions

Mark **Cancian**, **6-17**-2022, Mark Cancian worked on force structure
and acquisition issues in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and ran
research and executive programs at Harvard University's Kennedy School
of Government \"Aid to Ukraine Requires Increased Oversight,\" CSIS,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/aid-ukraine-requires-increased-oversight//EZAY

The size and scope of U.S. aid to Ukraine is increasing---and with it,
the need for oversight and accountability. [The Ukrainians are
heroically defending their country, and, in support of that struggle,
the **[United States has committed \$53 billion]{.mark} through
September 30**]{.underline}, the end of this fiscal year. [Early aid
packages included mainly **[weapons and supplies]{.mark}**, but the most
**[recent package]{.mark}** has **[billions of dollars of economic
aid]{.mark}**. Stronger **[oversight and controls are needed]{.mark}**
to ensure the funds are used as intended. Any corruption in handling
this aid would undermine the bipartisan support that the aid has
received and thereby impair the ability of the Ukrainian people to
continue their struggle.]{.underline}

[Aid related to the war totals \$53 billion: **\$13 billion in
supplemental funding** passed in March and \$40 billion in the package
passed in May.]{.underline} The military component provides [thousands
of weapons to arm the Ukrainians, from rifles, night-vision goggles,
rockets, and artillery pieces to antitank weapons like
Javelins.]{.underline} Humanitarian aid covers a wide variety of
activities, from global food relief to refugee resettlement.

Unlike earlier packages, the most recent aid package provides [**[large
resources]{.mark}** directly to the Ukrainian government: \$8.8 billion
of economic support, \$4 billion to purchase weapons, and potentially
**[several billion dollars more in training]{.mark}**, law enforcement,
and humanitarian assistance funds.]{.underline} Further, the rate at
which the United States provides [military and humanitarian aid has
increased from \$150 million a day early on to \$310 million per day in
the latest aid package. Only part of this goes directly to the Ukrainian
government; most aid flows through other institutions, particularly the
**Department of Defense**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, Ukraine is by far
the largest recipient of U.S. military and economic aid.

Ukraine desperately needs this economic aid to continue delivering
governmental services and rebuild its shattered economy. The war has
disrupted its ability to collect revenue, and the military effort has
priority on the resources it has. Further, the World Bank estimates that
the war will reduce Ukraine's GDP by 45 percent. However, [**pouring
[billions of dollars]{.mark}** into a beleaguered country with **[weak
governance]{.mark}** can overwhelm its control systems.]{.underline} The
\$8.8 billion of economic support alone is equivalent to 6 percent of
Ukraine's prewar annual GDP and 30 percent of government spending. The
temptation to divert pieces into the wrong pockets will be strong

[[Corruption]{.mark} has been a [real problem in]{.mark} Ukraine,
notwithstanding exaggerations by Russia and others]{.underline}. The
Corruption Perception Index ranked Ukraine at 122 out of 180 countries
globally. [[Ukrainian oligarchs]{.mark} have [dominated economic
life]{.mark}, having [taken advantage of]{.mark} the [**chaotic
conditions**]{.mark} when the Soviet Union collapsed. Frustration with
failures and inefficiency in the Ukrainian government got President
Zelensky, a political novice]{.underline}, elected in the first place.

[Weapons need tracking also]{.underline}. The United States expects that
the weapons will go to regular Ukrainian units for combat against the
Russian military. However, many [[militias]{.mark} with **[questionable
political pedigrees]{.mark}** have likely **[arisen during Ukraine's
existential crisis]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For example, the [**Azov
battalion**, which defended Mariupol, had **[neo-Nazi
inclinations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such [groups are also more likely
to **[abuse civilians and commit war crimes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
United States does not want its weapons [**[arming extremist
groups]{.mark}** that are only loosely controlled by the
government.]{.underline} Further, the United States does not want these
weapons used for other purposes, such as suppressing the
Russian-speaking population.

U.S. support for Ukraine has been remarkably bipartisan and popular in a
political environment otherwise characterized by bitter partisan
divisions. [The last Ukrainian aid package passed 368-57 in the House
and 86-11 in the Senate. Having some of this aid diverted for private
uses would undermine this bipartisan support. Even **hints of corruption
would be damaging**]{.underline}

The last aid package does require reporting from the Department of
Defense and provides \$5 million to enhance oversight in the Department
of State. These provisions recognize the problem but may be too limited,
given the extent of the aid and its sensitivity.

So, what else might be done? [One approach is to enhance existing
oversight mechanisms]{.underline}. In May, Senator Charles Grassley
(R-IA) wrote a letter to the State Department expressing his concerns
and received some assurances of enhanced oversight. Another approach is
to create a special inspector general. Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) has
[introduced a [bill to create]{.mark}]{.underline} [a special [inspector
general for Ukraine]{.mark}. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) tried to create
such an organization in the \$40 billion aid package, but
**[failed]{.mark}** in the face of a desire to move the package
quickly.]{.underline}

The scope of the aid is such that a special structure might be
warranted. The Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction
(SIGAR) is a useful model. [In Afghanistan, rampant corruption and weak
governance [undermined U.S. counterinsurgency efforts]{.mark}s
structures could not deal with these problems]{.underline}. Congress
established SIGAR in 2008 to provide focus and an independent voice.

SIGAR's mission is to conduct audits and investigations to (1) promote
the efficiency and effectiveness of reconstruction programs and (2)
detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. It provided Congress and the
American people with quarterly reports, lessons learned, and special
investigations when issues arose. For example, it recently investigated
whether Afghan officials fled with massive amounts of cash (they did
not).

Current efforts to support Ukraine might benefit from a similar
oversight mechanism to ensure that the economic aid goes where it is
needed, that arms purchases occur without corruption, and that weapons
go to appropriate units. Indeed, with assistance to Afghanistan ended,
it might be possible to repurpose some or all of SIGAR to oversight of
Ukrainian aid, thus bringing an existing organization and skilled
workforce to bear immediately.

An organization like SIGAR provides one further service: an independent
assessment of the conflict that offers a useful counterpoint to the
optimistic reports often coming from military and governmental
headquarters. For example, U.S. officials reported continuous progress
in Afghanistan, which SIGAR showed was overly optimistic. The same
dynamics may be playing out in the current struggle, where the Ukrainian
government has tightly controlled information, making it difficult for
outsiders to know what is actually going on.

The consensus is that the war in Ukraine will go on for an extended
period. U.S. aid goes through September 30, indicating the U.S.
expectation of a protracted conflict. As this aid flows to Ukraine,
especially aid in the form of financial support, increased oversight
would help preserve bipartisan support for the conflict. This increase
in oversight needs to happen sooner rather than later when invevitably,
some scandal forces the issue. As John Sopko, head of SIGAR, stated to
the Wall Street Journal, "It is really shocking that people are not
applying what we learned about the mistakes in Afghanistan to Ukraine."

#### Aid is really, really bad. Not a question of money

Barbara **Salera, 7-18**-2022, Recent recipient of the National Security
Education Program (NSEP) Boren Fellowship with Schedule A and NDAA 10
special hiring authority for a position with the US government. Current
doctoral candidate with six years experience in the analysis of US
foreign policy,.\"The Case Against Security Cooperation in Fragile
States,\" War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/the-case-against-security-cooperation-in-fragile-states//EZAY

[A dark cloud hangs over the Department of Defense. After the
"**strategic failure**" that was Afghanistan, the department is
struggling to figure out how not to repeat it]{.underline}. In
particular, [the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the lead agency
for advising, training, and equipping foreign governments, has taken a
number of key steps to prevent this from reoccurring.]{.underline} My
fellow colleagues in the agency, whose key mission is to build the
military capacity of foreign partners, took the collapse in Afghanistan
particularly hard. [After the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act
the agency established certification programs for its workforce and
introduced new concepts such as "**building capacity**" and
"**full-spectrum capability**."]{.underline} This is in addition to
various other initiatives, such as changing security cooperation
planning methods and requiring the assessment, monitoring, and
evaluation of outcomes. Though these initiatives predate the recent
events in Afghanistan, they symbolize a [widespread recognition of a
problem with how the United States conducts **military assistance**, a
recognition grimly underscored by the collapse of the Afghan security
forces in August 2021 and the **failures of Iraqi
reconstruction.**]{.underline}

For years, the United States has [**struggled with how best to build
foreign militaries**, with minor successes here and there but nothing
substantial over the long term]{.underline}. These noted difficulties
have led to what Jahara Matisek has called the "Faberge Egg army
problem[, an **expensively built** military ... **easily broken** by
insurgents]{.underline}." Some have argued that to address these poor
outcomes the United States should consolidate and simplify the
complicated domestic processes used to execute security cooperation, in
addition to augmenting programs by building the capacity of formal
defense institutions. However, [military assistance outcomes **will not
improve** simply by making the foreign military sales process faster or
by improving a country's defense institutions]{.underline}, as argued by
Jeremy Gwinn. [Many past articles on security cooperation focused on the
minutiae of how to improve the process as opposed to asking whether
security cooperation is the best means by which to accomplish national
security objectives]{.underline}. Security cooperation analyses have a
tendency to [focus on the "tactical" level of security cooperation and
concentrate on how to get the equipment to countries faster, or what
other augmentations or incentives the United States should add to make
it work.]{.underline} My argument focuses on the [strategic use of
security cooperation to accomplish wider American interests in fragile
states]{.underline}. By fragile states, I specifically reference those
countries that are dealing with

["extensive corruption and criminal behavior, inability to collect taxes
or otherwise draw on citizen support, large-scale involuntary
dislocation of the population, sharp economic decline, group-based
inequality, institutionalized persecution or discrimination, severe
demographic pressures, brain drain, and environmental
decay."]{.underline}

Rather than being a key foreign policy tool, the United States should
[carefully consider the **ramifications of increasing security
cooperation** in fragile states.]{.underline} For one, the [partner
nation will likely be **unable to sustain** this newfound military
capacity]{.underline}. Second, [miliary assistance is likely to lead to
an increase in **political instability**, **corruption**, **human-rights
abuses**, and **incidences of political oppression**]{.underline}. This
is because, at its core, the [U.S. approach to security cooperation is
**contradictory and anachronistic**]{.underline}. It is [based on
**faulty assumptions** about **conditions in partner nations**, often
designed to **defeat an enemy** the partner nation does not have, and
rooted in **American models** of defense institutions that do not exist.
Even during the era of great-power competition,]{.underline} it is not
clear that U.S. interests are best served by sending millions of dollars
in [defense articles and training to **fragile states** under the
**guise of "regional stability**," with the primary purpose of keeping
Russia and China out.]{.underline}

Inherent in the definition of security cooperation are explicit goals to
[**"build capacity,"** which often translate to ensuring that foreign
countries can use, maintain, and sustain the equipment that the United
States has transferred to them, either through **grant assistance** or
by **foreign military sales**]{.underline}. Given the internal
instability of fragile states, most military capabilities that the
United States is seeking to foster are for the purposes of internal
defense, counter-insurgency, or counter-terrorism. The suite of programs
used to transfer training and equipment are referred to as "building
partner capacity" or "train and equip programs." [Often **recipients**
of these programs are states that cannot or will not provide **basic
services** for their population or control their own territory, because
the government lacks either the **resources**, the authority, or the
trust of many of its citizens.]{.underline} While the state exists de
jure, there is no state de facto. The idea of transferring [millions of
dollars of **state-of-the-art** American equipment to a country that
cannot provide the most basic services to its population seems
**counter-intuitive**.]{.underline} How is the recipient country
expected to maintain it?

While the issue of sustainment is important, let's sidestep it and focus
on what happens after the [equipment is delivered and the training has
been completed.]{.underline} There may be anecdotal evidence of how
[security cooperation programs have been "successful" in building
military capacity, but numerous commentaries and studies argue that the
outcomes of this **newfound capacity** have been **less than
ideal**]{.underline}. According to these studies, an [increase in
security cooperation and security assistance correlated with an
increased incidence of **military coups**, **political oppression**,
**human-rights violations**, and other forms of **political
instability**.]{.underline} For example, a 2020 study conducted by
Patricia Sullivan, Leo Blanken, and Ian Rice analyzing post-conflict
countries between 1956 and 2012 found a [**statistically significant**
increase in incidences of **torture**, **extra-judicial killings**,
**disappearances,** **political imprisonment** and **executions,** and
incidents of **genocide** among **recipients of military
assistance**]{.underline}. A [second study, analyzing U.S. **security
assistance to 150 countries**, found a similar result: An increase in
military assistance (security cooperation) correlated with worse
performance on human rights.]{.underline} Both of these studies [include
years in which United States security cooperation programs were tied to
**Leahy Amendment** conditions concerning human rights that barred
sending material to units on a human-rights watch list and having every
recipient of training vette]{.underline}d. Regardless, [the results of
these studies should not be surprising.]{.underline} Fragile states in
which leaders lack resources to provide basic services for their
population often [turn to well-resourced (thanks to military assistance)
militaries to **repress restless populations** and **target political
opponents**]{.underline}. Political leaders in fragile states often use
[newfound military capacity to **shore up power**]{.underline}.
Moreover, if political leaders can depend on an [**outside donor**, like
the United States, to resource their military, as **opposed to taxes**
or some other internal resources, it further **severs the tie** between
the government and its citizens.]{.underline}

Regardless of these outcomes, the primary purpose of security
cooperation is "to build partner nation capacity consistent with
\[American\] defense objectives[." While the National Defense Strategy
outlines numerous defense objectives, in regions with fragile states
these objectives often include promoting regional stability,
counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism, and even policing (countering
human trafficking and drug trafficking).]{.underline} Therefore, [the
purpose of building military capacity in weak and failed states is
mostly to ensure the internal security of that state. However, the
American military, by law and tradition, is not designed to play an
internal security role]{.underline}. When the United States has engaged
in building foreign militaries, it has [tended to reflect the American
way of war centered around playing its **economic strength** and
**technological advantage** into a tactical advantage on the
battlefield]{.underline}. From doctrine to [defense institutions and
logistics systems, the entire Department of Defense is built around this
American way of war]{.underline}. In fact, for U.S. forces
counter-insurgency was a subset of total war until the late 2000s.
Through building partner capacity programs, especially those under
Department of Defense authorities, the [approach to security cooperation
has been to mirror American ways of war, doctrine, logistics systems,
and training by asking American military members and institutions to
help to build the capacity of defense institutions.]{.underline} In
Afghanistan in particular, the Department of Defense [sought to build a
military "that was modeled on the centralized command structures and
**complex bureaucracy** of the **Defense Department**" rather than build
a military to defeat the specific threat(s) that **Afghanistan faces**
rooted in **defense institutions that Afghanistan could
support**]{.underline}. The U.S. implementers drew on what they knew,
which resulted in Afghan forces **[not being able to function without
American support operationally and logistically]{.underline}**.
Ultimately, once the United States withdrew, the Afghan **[forces fell
quickly]{.underline}**.

[U.S. security practitioners specializing in institutional
capacity-building point to Afghanistan as an example of not taking
institutional capacity-building seriously, therefore dooming the
rebuilding of the Afghan military, and not necessarily of broader
security cooperation failure. Congress listened, and required frequently
used security cooperation programs to address institutional
capacity-building, which advocates argue can even help to prevent human
rights abuses, mostly through education or some sort of subject-matter
expert or military advisor exchanges.]{.underline} However,
institutional capacity-building is **[not the panacea]{.underline}** [to
the security cooperation dilemma that many within the Department of
Defense think it is.]{.underline} Institutional capacity-building
[programs still focus on the technical aspects of institutions, or give
cursory education on issues such as the law of armed
conflict]{.underline}. But these programs [**fail to consider** the
politics of how **authority within states emerges**, **develops,** or
**changes** in order to institutionalize these newly introduced
practices.]{.underline} To be clear, I am not arguing that security
cooperation planners do not consider politics at all. In fact, U.S. law
requires the Department of Defense to "jointly consider political,
social, economic, diplomatic, and historical factors, if any, of the
foreign country that may impact the effectiveness of the program."
[However, assessments of these factors are often **shallow** and
concentrate on the politics of **formal institutions**, **overlooking**
the importance of **informal institutions** and how power and authority
is actually wielded in fragile states.]{.underline}

In order to understand the deep politics of fragile states, it is
crucial to have an understanding of what a state is. The noted
sociologist Max Weber defined the state as a "human community that
(successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical
force within a given territory." The key for the Weberian conception of
the state is the term legitimate use of force. Weber argued that even
states that appear to be authoritarian will seek to root their claim of
legitimacy in one of three "pure" types of authority: legal,
traditional, or charismatic. [Authority in the American state most
closely aligns itself with legal legitimation, meaning that U.S.
citizens see the American state and government as legitimate because a
leader's power is derived from written laws, procedures, and
regulations.]{.underline} Leaders in [**fragile states** often try to
**legitimize their rule** not through legal means, but in a
sub-categorization of traditional authority: the **neo-patrimonial**
system.]{.underline} Leaders in neo-patrimonial states, while having a
veneer of bureaucracy, also seek to remain in power through clientelism,
or the exchange of goods and services for political support.
[Neo-patrimonial governments also prefer to keep **state institutions
weak** by **stacking bureaucracies**, like **defense institutions**,
with supporters and encouraging competition amongst individuals to
**keep them divided** and therefore not a threat to their
rule.]{.underline} This allows key military leaders to be [dependent on
the ruler for their wealth while also keeping "national armies divided
and faction-ridden."]{.underline} U.S. [military assistance is
**especially prone** to **contribute to corruption** as often this
assistance accounts for a **large portion of defense
budgets**]{.underline}. ["Ghost soldiers" (**nonexistent military
personnel** manufactured by **corrupt officials** to pocket their
salary)]{.underline} in [Iraq and Uganda are two well-known examples of
how easy it can be for military institutions to engage in
corruption]{.underline}. [Clientelism is not considered corruption, but
just the way governance is done in states in which the central
government competes with local actors for legitimacy.]{.underline} The
[**Taliban understood this** and **struck deals "with low-level
representatives** of the standing Afghan government through **bribes or
safety guarantees**" in order to **quickly seize control** of various
regions.]{.underline}

With this understanding of the state, a deeper look into the approach to
institutional capacity-building still [shows the failures of security
cooperation.]{.underline} According to the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency, [institutional capacity-building initiatives are to be "driven
by U.S. interests and values" but at the same time avoid "the projection
or imposition of United States' models,]{.underline} which may not fit
an ally or partner's specific context." [How can institutional
capacity-building be driven by U.S. values while also not be driven by
U.S. models?]{.underline} Often [Americans sent to help build
institutions are **subject-matter experts** in developing and running
**logistics systems**, human resource institutions, and other formal
defense institutions **in the United States**]{.underline}, [not
state-building or **political development** scholars with a deep
understanding of the informal politics of the state. These **gaps in
knowledge** are then filled in by their experience in running
institutions in the United States, resulting in **foreign defense
institutions** modeled on the complex **American bureaucratic system**,
a system rooted in **rational legitimacy**]{.underline}. Additionally,
institutional capacity programs are often aimed at improving the skills
of functionaries and/or rewriting laws, processes, or regulations that
improve the veneer of the neo-patrimonial system without necessarily
shifting governance style further down the legal continuum. This veneer
serves to further enhance a leader's international legitimacy while
doing nothing to improve their domestic legitimacy, to say nothing of
the standard of living of the country's citizens.

#### Defense forces don't need to be overwhelming -- 1 third is enough to deter because Russia knows the long-term response will be bad

Michael E. **O'Hanlon, 6-21**-2022, He is an adjunct professor at
Columbia, Georgetown, and George Washington universities, and a member
of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He also serves as
a member of the Defense Policy Board at the U.S. Department of Defense.
O'Hanlon was a member of the external advisory board at the Central
Intelligence Agency from 2011-12.\[\"Strengthening the US and NATO
defense postures in Europe after Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\"
Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strengthening-the-us-and-nato-defense-postures-in-europe-after-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/\]//EZAY

Washington should also [attempt to persuade other NATO nations to make
**increases in combat capability** in the Baltic region **comparable to
its own increases**]{.underline}. Collectively, [the **rest of NATO**
has a **larger GDP** and larger **armed forces than the United
States.**]{.underline} Admittedly, it [**only spends** in aggregate
about **half as much** on national defense.]{.underline} But because the
[countries of Europe do not in general share the global burdens of the
United States, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, they should in
principle be capable of the kind of additional efforts proposed here
---]{.underline} to wit, the [equivalent of a **combat brigade**, with
**combat aviation and air support**, and a plan to **surge more forces**
into the Baltics if need be]{.underline}. It will take time for Europe,
and Canada, to respond in this way, but the [goal should be established
now]{.underline}. Other changes, such as [expedited procedures for NATO
to gain priority access to central Europe's rail network in a crisis,
can perhaps be made sooner and should be pursued promptly.]{.underline}

The American changes would however be enough to [deny current Russian
force dispositions]{.underline} more than a **[three-to-one force
advantage]{.underline}** in normal peacetime conditions or in the [early
days of any crisis response]{.underline} ---
as [calculated](https://www.brookings.edu/research/feasible-us-steps-to-strengthen-nato-deterrence-in-the-baltics-and-poland/) by
U.S. Army officers Colonel John B. Gilliam and Major Ryan C. Van Wie.
(My recommendations are similar to those of Gilliam and Van Wie, as
developed before February 24, 2022, except that in response to the
Russian invasion, I would add U.S. combat forces in the Baltics
themselves rather than Germany, and would add forward air power as
well.) That 3:1 ratio is not an ironclad law of force planning; far from
it, as former Brookings scholar Joshua Epstein convincingly argued in
rigorous work several decades
ago.[^\[11\]^](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strengthening-the-us-and-nato-defense-postures-in-europe-after-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/#footnote-11) But
it is popular enough among militaries that it has some perceptual
significance in its own right. My own simple modeling suggests that [if
NATO has engaged forces that are one-third the size of Russia's, it
would have a good chance]{.underline} --- though hardly a guarantee ---
of [**stymieing the Russian attack long enough** to flow
**reinforcements into
theater**]{.underline}.[^\[12\]^](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strengthening-the-us-and-nato-defense-postures-in-europe-after-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/#footnote-12) Thus,
as an interim capability, it makes sense. It strikes a balance
reflecting, on the one hand, a much tenser European security
environment, but on the other a rather mediocre and weakened Russian
military.

In [conducting force planning]{.underline}, it is important neither to
underestimate nor overestimate the potential adversary. Russia could, in
a future war, avoid some of the [**mistakes witnessed** in its initial
onslaught against Ukraine ---]{.underline} [sticking to the roads where
forces can be **easily located** and attacked and **bottled up**,
failing to cover **vehicle flanks** with dismounted infantry, **failure
to provide** **adequate artillery support** for maneuver forces,
communicating in the open **without encryption**, providing **poor
tactical leadership** for combat units. But it will still be saddled
with an **outdated military,** **severely weakened** by the war in
Ukraine]{.underline}. Further, it will [[**lack
access**](https://www.brookings.edu/research/interim-security-insights-and-implications-from-the-first-two-months-of-the-russia-ukraine-war/) to
**advanced Western electronics** with which to modernize its armed
forces for years to come.]{.underline} Again, the argument seems
[compelling for a **relatively modest NATO force posture in the
Baltics** --- yet one made up of major combat units organized as such,
unlike the current eFP.]{.underline}

**CONCLUSION**

As 2022 unfolds, and tragedy in Ukraine continues, [NATO is nonetheless
in **strong military and political shape**]{.underline}. [No major
surgery is needed to right-size or reposition the alliance for the
challenge of a more reckless Russia]{.underline}. Moreover, NATO is
[already adapting somewhat to the new strategic environment, and the
**general trend is sound**.]{.underline} Its responses include [**modest
growth in defense spending** across much of the alliance and the likely
addition of Sweden and Finland to the alliance's roster, as well as
ongoing efforts in the realm of economic warfare.]{.underline}

[Yet **more change is needed nonetheless**]{.underline}. In the crucial
Baltic region, NATO should [shift from what has been an impressive
tripwire stance since 2017 to a **modest but meaningful forward-defense
posture**.]{.underline} NATO should have enough combat power in Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, and nearby locations that it could immediately resist
any Russian attack, be it in the form of "[little green
men](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-crimea/29790037.html),"
other covert aggression, or a more classic cross-border attack. But
[Russia's capacities in these areas are **generally limited**, so NATO's
response need not be monumental in scale.]{.underline} The United States
should station a brigade combat team, a combat aviation brigade, and two
to three squadrons of tactical fixed-wing airpower in the Baltics; it
should complete planned prepositioning of vehicles for a brigade combat
team in Poland while also adding transport, engineering, and air and
missile defense capabilities there. NATO allies should [commit to making
comparable additions to those recommended here]{.underline} for the U.S.
presence in the Baltics as soon as they can.

The good news is that these changes [do not require huge additional
expense]{.underline} and therefore need not fundamentally disrupt the
Pentagon's understandable desire to focus much future modernization on
the Indo-Pacific. Once facilities are built, keeping U.S. forces abroad
rather than at home typically [adds about
10%](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR201.html) to their
annual cost. For 15,000 U.S. military personnel, that would equate to
the rough vicinity of **[\$1 billion a
year.]{.underline}**[^\[13\]^](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strengthening-the-us-and-nato-defense-postures-in-europe-after-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/#footnote-13) [Local
partners can handle many of the expenses]{.underline} of building those
new facilities.

NATO's longstanding policy of not basing combat units in eastern member
states --- as a nod to Russian security sensitivities --- is no longer
relevant in light of Russia's attack on Ukraine.

If the Army and Air Force permanently station small numbers of units
abroad, in Poland and the Baltics, rather than maintaining a new forward
posture with frequent rotations of numerous units, they can [likely
**sustain this burden** **without enlarging** their force
structures]{.underline}. The Army's past preference to rotate units into
Poland (and South Korea) is understandable. This approach gives more
soldiers experience at preparing for deployment, as well as a chance to
serve abroad. But it also creates strain on the force structure, given
that at least three units are needed to sustain a single continuous
deployment (due to the need for training, preparation, and then
recovery). At this juncture, [NATO's longstanding **policy of not basing
combat units in eastern member states** --- as a nod to Russian security
sensitivities --- is n**o longer relevant** in light of Russia's attack
on Ukraine.]{.underline} Moreover, the [**very modest stationing** of
combat units proposed here for the Baltics and Poland **cannot pose a
meaningful threat** of cross-border aggression against
Russia.]{.underline}

Permanently stationing **[15,000]{.underline}** more American **[troops
in the Baltics and Poland,]{.underline}** while asking European and
Canadian allies to make similar additional efforts in eastern Europe as
well, is an affordable and prudent response to the increased Russian
threat to NATO's forward regions.
