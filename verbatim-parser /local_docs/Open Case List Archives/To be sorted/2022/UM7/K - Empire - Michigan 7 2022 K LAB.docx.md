# NEG -- EMPIRE K 

### Thesis -- Empire

Empire is distinct from capitalism or imperialism, though the impacts
and processes are similar. First theorized in the 2000 "Empire" by
Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Empire is conceptualized as a new form
of sovereignty replacing made to replace the nation-state. With a
late-20^th^ century marked by a wave of anti-imperialist movements as
well as increasing economic globalization, it was clear that great
powers could no longer exert control through colonial power. The
tradition paradigm of imperial nation state sovereignty had declined --
however, a new form of sovereignty was arising in its wake. "Empire" is
not a physical system of governance, but rather a biopolitical
instrument of global control. While the end of formal colonization may
have been a marked increase in individual sovereignty, it also acted as
a deterritorializing process which enabled the complete
reterritorialization by Empire. Empire functions, in essence, as a
global police power -- it is legitimated by crisis and universal values
that demand multilateral action in the same direction. This state of
exception gradually leads to further incorporation of the world within
Empire, until eventually there is not outside left -- at which point,
production, both economic and biopolitical, will be subject to this
universal ruler.

The K can simply be articulated as "the theory of Empire is true, the
AFF constructs Empire, Empire is bad" -- I think the literature is
conducive to both material and framework alternatives.

Below is the opening to the aforementioned book, it probably isn't super
useful as a card in round (maybe could be read in a 1-off shell or 2NC
overview as a theory of power card?) but is a pretty decent explanation
of the material from the source.

#### Empire is materializing -- the shift from nation-state sovereignty to international forums is not a decline of sovereignty but a transition to a new mode of globalized biopolitical control

"Empire" pg xi-xiii 2000) // ELog

[[Empire is materializing before our very eyes]{.mark}. Over the past
several decades, as colonial regimes were overthrown and then
precipitously after the Soviet barriers to the capitalist world market
finally collapsed, [we have witnessed]{.mark} an irresistible and
irreversible [globalization of economic and cultural exchanges. Along
with the global market]{.mark} and global circuits of production [has
emerged]{.mark} a global order, a new logic and structure of rule---in
short, [a new form of sovereignty. Empire is the political subject
that]{.mark} effectively regulates these global exchanges, the sovereign
power that [governs the world]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many argue that the
globalization of capitalist production and exchange means that economic
relations have become more autonomous from political controls, and
consequently that political sovereignty has declined. Some celebrate
this new era as the liberation of the capitalist economy from the
restrictions and distortions that political forces have imposed on it;
others lament it as the closing of the institutional channels through
which workers and citizens can influence or contest the cold logic of
capitalist profit. [It is certainly true that, in step with the
processes of globalization, [the sovereignty of nation-states]{.mark},
while still effective, [has progressively declined]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The primary factors of production and exchange--- money, technology,
people, and goods---move with increasing ease across national
boundaries; hence the nation-state has less and less power to regulate
these flows and impose its authority over the economy. Even the most
dominant nation-states should no longer be thought of as supreme and
sovereign authorities, either outside or even within their own borders.
[[The decline in sovereignty of nation-states]{.mark}, however, [does
not mean that sovereignty as such has declined]{.mark}.1 [Throughout the
contemporary transformations]{.mark}, political controls, state
functions, and regulatory [mechanisms have continued to rule]{.mark} the
realm of [economic and social production]{.mark} and exchange. Our basic
hypothesis is that [sovereignty has taken a new form, composed of a
series of national and supranational organisms united under a single
logic of rule. This]{.mark} new global form of sovereignty [is]{.mark}
what we call [Empire]{.mark}.]{.underline} The declining sovereignty of
nation-states and their increasing inability to regulate economic and
cultural exchanges is in fact one of the primary symptoms of the coming
of Empire. The sovereignty of the nation-state was the cornerstone of
the imperialisms that European powers constructed throughout the modern
era. [[By ''Empire]{.mark},'' however, [we understand]{.mark} something
altogether [different from ''imperialism]{.mark}.'' The
[boundaries]{.mark} defined by the modern system of nation-states [were
fundamental to European colonialism]{.mark} and economic expansion: the
[territorial boundaries]{.mark} of the nation [delimited the center of
power from which rule was exerted]{.mark} over external foreign
territories through a system of channels and barriers that alternately
facilitated and obstructed the flows of production and
circulation.]{.underline} Imperialism was really an extension of the
sovereignty of the European nation-states beyond their own boundaries.
Eventually nearly all the world's territories could be parceled out and
the entire world map could be coded in European colors: red for British
territory, blue for French, green for Portuguese, and so forth. Wherever
modern sovereignty took root, it constructed a Leviathan that overarched
its social domain and imposed hierarchical territorial boundaries, both
to police the purity of its own identity and to exclude all that was
other. The passage to Empire emerges from the twilight of modern
sovereignty. [In contrast to imperialism, [Empire establishes no
territorial center]{.mark} of power [and does not rely on fixed
boundaries]{.mark} or barriers. [It is a decentered and
deterritorializing apparatus of rule that progressively incorporates the
entire global realm within it]{.mark}s open, expanding
frontiers.]{.underline} Empire manages hybrid identities, flexible
hierarchies, and plural exchanges through modulating networks of
com-mand. [[The distinct national colors of the imperialist map]{.mark}
of the world [have merged and blended in the imperial global
rainbow]{.mark}.]{.underline} The transformation of the modern
imperialist geography of the globe and the realization of the world
market signal a passage within the capitalist mode of production. Most
significant, the spatial divisions of the three Worlds (First, Second,
and Third) have been scrambled so that we continually find the First
World in the Third, the Third in the First, and the Second almost
nowhere at all. [[Capital seems to be faced with a smooth
world]{.mark}---or really, a world [defined]{.mark} by new and complex
[regimes of differentiation and homogenization, deterritorialization and
reterritorialization]{.mark}.]{.underline} The construction of the paths
and limits of these new global flows has been accompanied by a
transformation of the dominant productive processes themselves, with the
result that the role of industrial factory labor has been reduced and
priority given instead to communicative, cooperative, and affective
labor. [[In the postmodernization of the global economy, the creation of
wealth tends ever more toward]{.mark} what we will call [biopolitical
production, the production of social life itself, in which the economic,
the political, and the cultural increasingly overlap and invest one
another.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### L -- Algorithmic State

#### The nation-state is a façade meant to cover mass exploitation and the rapid proliferation of smart technology in the form of AI. The 1AC's call to emerging AI technologies in a quest for absolute rationality is one that obfuscates the role of humans in governmentality and allows algorithmic governance under silicon-based life forms.

The damage these nationalist movements are wreaking is amplified when
minorities such as Muslims and refugees are singled out in hate-filled
discourses in popular media representations that then get immediately
reinforced by social media piggy-backing. These encourage disgruntled
individuals, acting as supposedly "lone wolfs", to violently vent their
anger against innocent people. [Targets including religious worshippers,
burka clad women, innocent children, migrant workers, asylum seekers and
refugees clearly indicate that these minorities are being scapegoated
for grievances against exploitative economic practices employed by the
global Western order.]{.underline} But instead of addressing the
underlying causes of such grievances, nationalist movements appear to be
delivering popular masses into the hands of those controlling production
and consumption. With anti-intellectual anti-elitist bitterness driving
discourses, popular white nationalist movements during the first two
decades of the 21st century reject analysis and reasoning for simplistic
blame games exonerating white privilege while blaming those who are
different and poorer than themselves[. On the whole, contemporary
nationalist movements would appear to be better considered as
counter-revolutionary, reactionary, or conservative movements that seek
to reinforce white privilege rather than address the very real problems
that people face.]{.underline} **[I backgrounded the emergence of these
social movements with the changes taking place in the public sphere --
the space of Nation -- during the 20th century, and particularly the
emergence of an ever more sophisticated notion of economy,
globalisation, and technology. All these innovations and developments
have reduced the scope of the national domain at the same time as
opening up a relatively ungoverned international space]{.underline}**.
[There are many, entire communities in fact, disempowered by this
process, not least indigenous communities who happen to be situated in
the transnational resource rich spheres that global corporates such as
miners and loggers decide to exploit ruthlessly. These displaced
communities then provide the guest workers, refugees, illegal
immigrants, and asylum seekers being targeted by disgruntled whites.
Rather than protecting vulnerable individuals and communities, the
realigning of State power in the latter part of the 20th century has
only exposed the world to greater human exploitation while at the same
time as empowering global corporations to take greater advantage of
prevailing circumstances and opportunities.]{.underline} In a sense,
this has resulted in a new form of global citizen, the multinational
corporation, which is arguably now the single biggest player in a world
where power, money, and influence intermingle with ever increasing
subtlety and speed. [Then turning to and mapping technological
developments during the last 200 years suggests that the corporation
itself may be in the process of being colonised as new ever smarter
technology increasingly finds convenient shelter under corporate
umbrellas, or, as a geek might see it, adopting corporate skins for new
technological processes produced in highly integrated networks by
increasingly sophisticated algorithms]{.underline}. If corporations
remain the source of greatest power in the new emerging global order,
the driving force is still the driven power-lusting individual, who
stands atop the corporations's mast and beckons those who man the oars
below to follow his (for CEOs remain predominantly men) direction.
**[However, as the actual work of international corporations is
increasingly performed by smart machines, so artificial intelligence is
assuming the true locus of power with great alacrity]{.underline}**.
Under such circumstances, the CEO may think he's in command, but in
actuality he too has become merely an operative for a greater will
working surreptitiously behind the corporate's skyscraped facade. **[And
it is technology which may ultimately prove to be the greatest factor to
be reckoned with, not high-flyers like Rupert Murdoch, Mark Zuckerberg,
Donald Trump, and Robert Mercer. Mapping the world after 2000 suggests
that the real nexus of power is shifting away from the centrality
biology once took for granted over social, political, and economic
activity and the governmental formations that sought to control them,
and towards a new form of organisation realised in and by centrally
located intelligent algorithms]{.underline}**. [While the stratification
of society according to human prejudice and predispostion continues to
shape the natural and the social worlds there is emerging a new machine
like rationality, one that carbon-based life forms have not even started
to comprehend.]{.underline} If this alternative new world order is still
being assembled, the design, capabilities, and limitations of the system
are already deeply embedded in what I'll term the logic of global
capital on the one hand, and the invisible hand of intelligent
algorithms on the other. [Increasingly today, resources and energies are
directed not towards human and other biological requirements, but rather
the increasingly hungry but still mysterious rationalities of the global
order]{.underline}. The single most potent symbol of global capital is
undoubtedly the multinational corporation, whose objective is
increasingly "actualised" by and through technology, so it seems
predictable that the global economy will increasingly respond to the
needs of technology. In the glitzy whirpool of sparkling LEDs, who will
notice the ever decreasing political economic interest in and support
for sustaining biological life, particularly with the environment and
the other ecological disasters that are threatening it with extinction.
Enter again the multinational corporation's heroic CEO, who, striding
confidently onto a stage TEDs-like stage, stands proudly like a Caeser,
Darius or Alexander Come Lately, and confidently proclaims how "his"
latest innovation are about to sweep (what remains of) the world
asunder. Fully expecting his company's ever boldly blinking bottom line
to continue streaking, perhaps extending its global reach and dominance
to infinity, and with the kindness and generosity of the internet, he is
about to tell his audience all about how they too can emulate his
successes. Then at the bottom of the screen flashes an immediate alert
as the global stock market responds to computer-triggered impulses from
around the world. The automated(?) self governing bots have already
kicked in and within nanoseconds fortunes capable of feeding the entire
human population twice over for a year are made and lost. Meanwhile,
unbeknownst to him, little electronic bots are preparing the final
touches in the bedroom where our 'CEO as Hero' will soon assume his
final resting place. [As the long laid plans for the smooth transition
from the last human CEO to the first fully computer generated New Man
(this one comes with a mind made up from a network of electronic
synapses) are about to be put into place. Everything has been programmed
to ensure that the process will be neat and tidy as well as bloodless, a
surgical extraction that neutralises an unstable component without any
teetering or shimmering of the delicately balanced system and ensure
there is no collateral damage as a result of this long awaited
transition.]{.underline} **[In a world where climate change and mass
extinction have brought an end to the viability for carbon based
organisms, it has become expedient, rational, logical, economic, as well
as fiscally clever for smart silicon-based algorithms (its not called
"life" anymore as that doesn't accurately describe what it really is) to
finally assume command over all ongoing processes behind what remains of
the Rand Corporation]{.underline}**. With the redundancy of carbon-based
life both imminent and certain, homo-CEO-erectus.2, the embryo like
electronic child in the new Monoverse, is about to claim ascendency as
the rightful evolutionary offspring to humanity.

### L -- Borders

#### Compliance in a bordered nation-state paradigm invests in a logic of necropolitics that render the bodies between borders as expendable

**BUCKEL & WISSEL 10** (Sonja Buckel, Jens Wissel - Fankfurt Institute
of Social Research) "State Project Europe: The Transformation of the
European Border Regime and the Production of Bare Life, International
Political Sociology", Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2010, Pages 33--49,
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-5687.2009.00089.x//vivi

Agamben refers to a basic problem in the constitution of modern nation
states: The [state as a nation implies that ancestry---in his terms
''bare life''--- becomes the foundation of sovereignty]{.underline}. The
[community created by the nation is based on a biopolitical
imagining]{.underline}, to use Balibar's terms, on the illusionary yet
powerful assumption that ''generations reproducing within an almost
unchang- ing territory in almost stable relationships for centuries have
passed on an unchanging essence.'' Such a ''created people'' is
considered as the basis and origin of political power (Balibar 1992:107,
115). [Following Agamben, refugees thus represent an ''alarming factor''
because they question the congruence of descent and nationality, of
human being and citizen. Immigration to countries in the European Union
has grown to such an extent that this reversal of perspec- tives is now
''fully beyond doubt,'' as a growing number of people are no longer
represented in the nation.]{.underline} The refugee turns from the
''apparent marginal figure'' into the pivotal figure of our political
present (Agamben l.c.). Agamben's thesis ties in with thoughts Hannah
Arendt had already formulated in 1955 when reflecting on her own
experience as a refugee. She had argued that [human rights, which claim
to ''originate solely from the very fact of personhood'' regardless of
any political status, are in fact questioned by the mass emergence of
refugees]{.underline} (Arendt 1955:438[). For the deviation of refugees
consists in the fact that they are not officially represented by any
state, since the national way of life ties the enforceability of rights
to citizenship; by doing so, it expels a growing number of people into a
no man's land with neither right nor law: ''Whomever the course of
events expelled from the old trinity of people-terri- tory-state,
grounding the nation, was left home- and stateless; whoever lost the
rights guaranteed by citizenship, would remain without
rights\....Whoever was chased out of the country by their pursuer like a
reject of humanity]{.underline}---Jews, Trotskyists and so on---was
received as a reject of humanity everywhere else'' (Arendt 1955:402 et
seq.). [The moment individuals left the state to which they were
subservient by birth and national affiliation, the moment they were
unable to claim their civil rights outside of their territory, they
became uncertain about their fundamental human rights. So the very
instant they were referred back to the rock bottom of rights which they
had ostensibly gained through birth, it became apparent to them as the
social construct of a nation-state, which rules the population as a
people on the territory it has constituted. The borders of the
nation-state that were sup- posed to mark nothing but the jurisdiction
of the democratic constitution according to democratic republicanism,
and were supposed to be traversable for everyone willing to accept the
applicable law (Maus 2002:231), turned out to be a technique for the
deprivation of rights.]{.underline} Once expelled from the trinity, the
ref- ugee's ''nothing-but-personhood'' catapulted them into some kind of
a ''state of nature,'' in which they lost any relation to the world
built by human beings. As soon as all other social and political
qualities were lost, [no rights whatsoever arose from the remaining mere
personhood. The world showed no high regard for the abstract bareness of
personhood]{.underline} (Arendt 1955:449). The spaces in which no rights
can be asserted anymore thus stretched and assumed the shape of
ex-territorial zones of an ''invisible police state,'' in which the
sphere of police control expanded immensely and detention centers would
become the only practical substitute for the lack of a national
territory: ''They are the only fatherland the world has to offer to the
fatherland-less'' (Arendt 1955:431). As far as its inhabitants are
stripped of any legal status and entirely reduced to bare life, Agamben
concludes in apparent parallel to Arendt (Agamben 2002:180, 183) that
[''the camp is the most absolute bio-political space that has ever been
realized, in which power is confronted only by pure life with- out any
means of mediation''; it is the ''materialization of the state of emer-
gency.'' With the loss of their citizenship, refugees do not only lose
all of their rights, but more fundamentally, the ''right to have
rights'']{.underline} (Arendt 1955:446). By taking the European Union as
an example, in the following, we would like to show that this historical
analysis of European migration policy is still highly relevant, although
the transnationalization of state and law has fundamentally transformed
the international arrangement of states compared with Arendt's times. As
a result, we can perceive a new European state project currently
reproduc- ing the loss of ''the right to have rights'' in extended form.
What we want to introduce to the discourse of critical migration studies
(Guild 2009:11) is a critical state theoretical approach. In our view,
this is necessary as we witness a period of grave institutional
displacements in the way political domination is exe- cuted, while we
are at the same time confronted with a certain state-theoretical
dilemma: On the one hand, the focus of mainstream migration studies is
state- centric (ibid. 22); on the other hand, critical approaches
abandon this statist approach to the benefit of a perspective of
migratory movements---a move that is definitely a sign of progress in
critical thought. However, this constellation leads to a dichotomous
separation of both perspectives, and thus a failure to challenge
traditional notions of the state used in mainstream migration studies
and international relations alike. This traditional understanding
assumes the state as a taken-for-granted entity mostly represented as
''sovereignty,'' under- stood as a legal rather than as a sociological
category. To overcome this dilemma, we conceive the state following the
materialist tradition as a social rela- tion, or to cite Poulantzas
(2001:154) as ''material condensation of social rela- tions of forces.''
By arguing in this way, we apply from the outset a political
sociological approach which seeks to transcend the dualism of state and
society[. The practices of migratory movements are therefore an integral
part of the social relations crystallizing in the state. What follows
from this is that the state can no longer be understood as a mono-
lithic entity, but as an ensemble of heterogeneous competing apparatuses
stitched together only by a fragile state project. Accordingly, the
state is neither simply an instrument of powerful actors in control of
national borders nor a problem solver in the service of common welfare,
as it is seen in the tradition of German idealism. The contradictions
between the demand for increased global mobility and the intention to
wall off societies that we can observe in many states is conceptualized
as the ''liberal paradox'']{.underline} (Hollifield 2003:35 et seq.). As
for our state-theoretical approach, we take this apparent paradox as a
structural feature of modern state- hood and its institutions: The
failure of migration control policy is per se not a loss of function;
rather, such contradictions are always inherent in capitalist socie-
ties. The [conflicting actions of different state apparatuses are the
result of varying social contradictions manifest in competing and
heterogeneous apparatuses. In short, the state exists not outside of
society and its contradictions. In some respect, this becomes even
clearer with regard to the process of European integration.]{.underline}
In developing this analysis, we demonstrate that in the context of
Europeanization a process of rescaling the state takes place in which a
new control regime of global mobility evolves producing specific zones
of stratified rights (see Bach 2008:153). Our investigation focuses on
the zone of illegalization: We concentrate on the two techniques that
produce the ''bare life'' highlighted by Arendt: the ''camp'' and the
invisible ''police state.'' It will become clear that the
institutionalizing of the ''the right of every human being to belong to
mankind'' (Arendt 1955:446 et seq.), and that means: to an international
regime, in which ''the right to have rights'' is detached from
citizenship (Benhabib 2004:68), is still lacking. In con- trast to
Giorgio Agamben, we do not [trace this constellation back to the
collapse of the concept of human rights, but to hegemonies and power
relations.]{.underline}

### L -- Crisis

#### Narratives of crisis are foundational of Empire -- the state of exception imposed by their impacts creates a universal right of intervention which enables the global expansion of the new form of sovereignty

"Empire" pg 13-18 2000) // ELog

We must avoid defining the passage to Empire in purely negative terms,
in terms of what it is not, as for example is done when one says: the
new paradigm is defined by the definitive decline of the sovereign
nation-states, by the deregulation of international markets, by the end
of antagonistic conflict among state subjects, and so forth. If the new
paradigm were to consist simply in this, then its consequences would be
truly anarchic. Power, however---and Michel Foucault was not the only
one to teach us this---fears and despises a vacuum. [[The new paradigm
functions]{.mark} already [in completely positive terms]{.mark}---and it
could not be otherwise. The new paradigm is both system and hierarchy,
centralized [construction of norms and]{.mark} far-reaching [production
of legitimacy, spread]{.mark} out [over world
space]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is configured ab initio as a dynamic and
flexible systemic structure that is articulated horizontally. We
conceive the structure in a kind of intellectual shorthand as a hybrid
of Niklas Luhmann's systems theory and John Rawls's theory of justice.20
[Some call this situation ''[governance without government]{.mark}'' to
indicate the structural logic, at times imperceptible but always and
increasingly effective, that sweeps all actors within the order of the
whole.21]{.underline} The systemic totality has a dominant position in
the global order, breaking resolutely with every previous dialectic and
developing an integration of actors that seems linear and spontaneous.
At the same time, however, the effectiveness of the consensus under a
supreme authority of the ordering appears ever more clearly. [All
conflicts, [all crises]{.mark}, and all dissensions effectively [push
forward the process of integration and]{.mark} by the same measure [call
for more central authority.]{.mark}]{.underline} Peace, equilibrium, and
the cessation of conflict are the values toward which everything is
directed. [The [development of the global system]{.mark} (and of
imperial right in the first place) [seems to be]{.mark} the [development
of a machine]{.mark} that imposes procedures of continual
contractualization that lead to systemic equilibria---a machine [that
creates a continuous call for authority.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
machine seems to predetermine the exercise of authority and action
across the entire social space. Every movement is fixed and can seek its
own designated place only within the system itself, in the hierarchical
relationship accorded to it. This preconstituted movement defines the
reality of the process of the imperial constitutionalization of world
order---the new paradigm. This imperial paradigm is qualitatively
different from the various attempts in the period of transition to
define a project of international order.22 Whereas the previous,
transitional perspectives focused attention on the legitimating dynamics
that would lead toward the new order, in the new paradigm it is as if
the new order were already constituted. [[The]{.mark} conceptual
[inseparability of the title and exercise of power is]{.mark} affirmed
from the outset, as [the]{.mark} effective [a priori of the system.
]{.mark}]{.underline}The imperfect coincidence, or better the
ever-present temporal and spatial disjunctions between the new central
power and the field of application of its regulation, do not lead to
crises or paralysis but merely force the system to minimize and overcome
them. In short, the paradigm shift is defined, at least initially, by
the recognition that only an established power, overdetermined with
respect to and relatively autonomous from the sovereign nation-states,
is capable of functioning as the center of the new world order,
exercising over it an effective regulation and, when necessary,
coercion. It follows that, as Kelsen wanted, but only as a paradoxical
effect of his utopia, a sort of juridical positivism also dominates the
formation of a new juridical ordering.23 The capacity to form a system
is, in effect, presupposed by the real process of its formation.
Moreover, the process of formation, and the subjects that act in it, are
attracted in advance toward the positively defined vortex of the center,
and this attraction becomes irresistible, not only in the name of the
capacity of the center to exercise force, but also in the name of the
formal power, which resides in the center, to frame and systematize the
totality. Once again we find a hybrid of Luhmann and Rawls, but even
before them we have Kelsen, that utopian and thus involuntary and
contradictory discoverer of the soul of imperial right! Once again, the
ancient notions of Empire help us articulate better the nature of this
world order in formation. [As Thucydides, Livy, and Tacitus all teach us
(along with Machiavelli commenting on their work), [Empire is formed not
on]{.mark} the basis of [force itself but on]{.mark} the basis of the
capacity to present [force]{.mark} as being [in the service of]{.mark}
right and [peace. ]{.mark}]{.underline}All interventions of the imperial
armies are solicited by one or more of the parties involved in an
already existing conflict. [[Empire is not born of its own will
but]{.mark} rather it is [called into being]{.mark} and constituted on
the basis of [its capacity to resolve conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Empire is formed and its intervention becomes juridically legitimate
only when it is already inserted into the chain of international
consensuses aimed at resolving existing conflicts. To return to
Machiavelli, the expansion of Empire is rooted in the internal
trajectory of the conflicts it is meant to resolve.24 [[The first task
of Empire]{.mark}, then, [is to enlarge the realm of the consensuses
that support its own power]{.mark}.]{.underline} The ancient model gives
us a first approximation, but we need to go well beyond it to articulate
the terms of the global model of authority operating today. Juridical
positivism and natural right theories, contractualism and institutional
realism, formalism and systematism can each describe some aspect of it.
Juridical positivism can emphasize the necessity for a strong power to
exist at the center of the normative process; natural right theories can
highlight the values of peace and equilibrium that the imperial process
offers; contractualism can foreground the formation of consensus;
realism can bring to light the formative processes of the institutions
adequate to the new dimensions of consensus and authority; and formalism
can give logical support to what systematism justifies and organizes
functionally, emphasizing the totalizing character of the process. What
juridical model, however, grasps all these characteristics of the new
supranational order? In first attempting a definition, we would do well
to recognize that the dynamics and articulations of the new
supranational juridical order correspond strongly to the new
characteristics that have come to define internal orderings in the
passage from modernity to postmodernity.25 We should recognize this
correspondence (perhaps in Kelsen's manner, and certainly in a realistic
mode) not so much as a ''domestic analogy'' for the international
system, but rather as a ''supranational analogy'' for the domestic legal
system. The primary characteristics of both systems involve hegemony
over juridical practices, such as procedure, prevention, and address.
Normativity, sanction, and repression follow from these and are formed
within the procedural developments. [The reason for the relative (but
effective) coincidence of [the new]{.mark} functioning of domestic law
and [supranational law]{.mark} derives first of all from the fact that
they [operate on]{.mark} the same terrain, namely, [the terrain of
crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Carl Schmitt has taught us, however,
crisis on the terrain of the application of law should focus our
attention on the ''exception'' operative in the moment of its
production.26 Domestic and supranational law are both defined by their
exceptionality. [[The]{.mark} function of [exception]{.mark} here [is
very important. ]{.mark}]{.underline}In order to take control of and
dominate such a completely fluid situation, it is necessary to grant the
intervening authority (1) the capacity to define, every time in an
exceptional way, the demands of intervention; and (2) the capacity to
set in motion the forces and instruments that in various ways can be
applied to the diversity and the plurality of the arrangements in
crisis. Here, therefore, is born, in the name of the exceptionality of
the intervention, a form of right that is really a right of the police.
The formation of a new right is inscribed in the deployment of
prevention, repression, and rhetorical force aimed at the reconstruction
of social equilibrium: all this is proper to the activity of the police.
[[We can]{.mark} thus [recognize the initial and implicit source of
imperial right in terms of police action]{.mark} and the capacity of the
police to create and maintain order.]{.underline} The legitimacy of the
imperial ordering supports the exercise of police power, while at the
same time the activity of global police force demonstrates the real
effectiveness of the imperial ordering. The juridical power to rule over
the exception and the capacity to deploy police force are thus two
initial coordinates that define the imperial model of authority.
Universal Values We might well ask at this point, however, should we
still use the juridical term ''right'' in this context? How can we call
right (and specifically imperial right) a series of techniques that,
founded on a state of permanent exception and the power of the police,
reduces right and law to a question of pure effectiveness? In order to
address these questions, we should first look more closely at the
process of imperial constitution that we are witnessing today. We should
emphasize from the start that its reality is demonstrated not only by
the transformations of international law it brings about, but also by
the changes it effects in the administrative law of individual societies
and nation-states, or really in the administrative law of cosmopolitical
society.27 Through its contemporary transformation of supranational law,
the imperial process of constitution tends either directly or indirectly
to penetrate and reconfigure the domestic law of the nation-states, and
thus supranational law powerfully overdetermines domestic law. [Perhaps
[the most significant symptom]{.mark} of this transformation [is
the]{.mark} development of the so-called [right of
intervention]{.mark}.28 This is commonly [conceived as the]{.mark} right
or [duty of the dominant subjects of the world order to
intervene]{.mark} in the territories of other subjects [in the interest
of]{.mark} preventing or resolving [humanitarian problems]{.mark},
guaranteeing [accords, and]{.mark} imposing [peace.
]{.mark}]{.underline}The right of intervention figured prominently among
the panoply of instruments accorded the United Nations by its Charter
for maintaining international order, but the contemporary
reconfiguration of this right represents a qualitative leap. No longer,
as under the old international ordering, do individual sovereign states
or the supranational (U.N.) power intervene only to ensure or impose the
application of voluntarily engaged international accords. [Now
[supranational subjects]{.mark} that are [legitimated]{.mark} not
[by]{.mark} right but by [consensus intervene in the name of any]{.mark}
type of [emergency and]{.mark} superior [ethical principles.]{.mark}
What stands [behind this intervention is]{.mark} not just a permanent
state of emergency and exception, but [a permanent state of emergency
and exception justified by the appeal to essential values of
justice.]{.mark}]{.underline} In other words, the right of the police is
legitimated by universal values.29

### L -- Colonial Empire

#### The structure of the Nation-state is one that is indistinguishable from the racialized legacy of coloniality. The prerogative of empire is to promote a national memory that seeks the sole preservation of biological life above all resulting in the codification of hegemonic norms and mass structural violence.

Mapping Nation, State, and Citizen -- The world in 1900 If the world at
1900 had already long been transitioning through a period of radical
transformation called "modernisation" (Harvey 1990iii), an important
distinction needs to be made between society, state (see Held's "The
Development of the Modern State" in Hall and Gieben 1992, also Barrow
1993), and nationiv (Foucault 2010:326-348). [Pierre Clastres (1994,
1998i, 1998ii) identifies society as a broad collective of the people
making up any specific community. Modern notions of "society" and "civic
society", as well as "community" and "commonwealth" continue to reflect
that notion as they refer specifically to groups of people as
distinguished by their collectivity]{.underline}. Society, according to
Clastres, contrasts with the modern "Nation-State" at two levels. **[The
State can be said to be the set of modes, means, rules and instruments
of governance that society uses to implement and maintain its internal
composition, structure, organisation, and identity. The idea of the
"Nation", on the other hand, and in particular the Nation-State since
the 16th century (Foucault 2010:332), is a relatively modern invention
(Anderson 2016) pointing to a particular form of organisation and
structure of internal components, institutions and identities and the
various hegemonic orders of governance and discourse these call into
being]{.underline}**. The emergence of the Nation-State coincides with
the conglomeration of larger communities becoming totalised and
imagining themselves as both collectively unique and sovereign. [The
Nation-State seeks to unify both larger groups of people and a variety
of geophysical terrains into a singularity and which is again contrasted
to the organs of State which are regarded as a body of legal as well as
social codes of behaviour and the institutions that police the members
of this modern Nation-State and that together order the collective
actions and beliefs as well as lives of people in forming such specific
modern Nation-State societies.]{.underline} The State's instruments and
apparati are thus essentially involved in, and promote, a particular
kind of social order, and the peculiarities such as language, habits,
customs, traditions, as well as myths and images that the State holds
about itself and that underpin it. Needless to say, the State's spaces
overlap with other imaginary spaces created by the formation of "the
Nation" as well as by "society" in order to coalesce the social
imaginings of "the People" that underpins them. A first level
distinction can be made with the formation of the Nation-State. Foucault
(2010) charts a history of the evolution of the French Nation, analysing
the process of subjectification underpinning the invention of modern
citizenship (Beck 2006, Chambers 1995, Hennerz 2000, Ianelli & Mossaro
2017, Sennett 1986, Stevenson 2001, 2003).v Commencing with a series of
traits and characteristics, the first object of the Nation-forming
project is to subject people to certain normative forms and
rationalisations. The practice of national identity starts in a series
of internalised as well as external State imposed actions. To be French,
an individual must not only demonstrate a "native" command of
(standardised Parisian) French but also to trade in a range of
currencies that distinguish and connect to myths and ideas of the French
Nation. In addition to language, markers include attitudes, food,
culture and dress, education, as well as subservience to the State's
legal, educational, and taxation regimes and regulatory legislative
instruments. People could still consider themselves Poitier-ians, or
Avignon-ese, or Strasbourg-ians, but they had first to think of
themselves as French. So being "French" became synonymous for a unified
world shared by those living in a specified geographical area and
unified by certain beliefs and practices which became generalised by
themselves and others. It is ideas of "French" and "France" that bind
people together (Barthes 1981:116-117). In Imagined Communities (2006),
[Benedict Anderson investigates the origins and spread of nationalism
and the emergence of modern Nation-States. Anderson wants to understand
why individuals form a relationship of "horizontal" "comradeship" and
"fraternity" so strong that it makes "possible, over the past two
centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as
willingly die for such a limited imagining" of themselves as conceived
by the Nation's apparatus. The bond that nationalism engenders is
limited, as Anderson sees it, because those who mostly died in defending
their nation did so even though the benefits afforded to them by their
State was minimal]{.underline}. For Anderson, the power of the
privileged classes to convince more impoverished and disadvantaged
members of the broader community to not just willingly give up their
pursuit of their own interests, but also their lives, to defend a system
which oppresses them seems irrational. **[Anderson is drawn to conclude
that inventions like the "national imagination" and "national memory"
(as well as a "national amnesia") help to project generic notions and
ideas on to individuals and on those around them and gain and grant a
sense of singular unity, affection, and belonging (Anderson 2006:
1-7).]{.underline}** Anderson wants to understand how and why
nationalism enables people to feel "closer" to people who, in many
respects, are their oppressors while seeking to kill others who do not
have any impact on their lives whatsoever. He wants to understand how
nationalism bifurcates the world between those who share a sense of an
inside populated by (imagined) connectivity, loyalty, relatedness, and
identification from an exteriorised swathe of others (aliens,
foreigners, or simply unknown strangers) but with whom -- from a
relative subjectivity that more closely reflects their own than that of
their masters -- such individuals respective everyday realities share
more in common with the enemies of the Nation-State. [Moving further
from the "centre" of the world at 1900, Edward Said's Orientalism
(Penguin 1995) glimpses life beyond Europe and of someone living in a
colonial State and the dehumanised subjectivity that
creates]{.underline} (Fanon 2001: 13). A well-to-do, educated native of
Algiers or Martinique or Vietnam may have felt French but, as Frantz
Fanon himself learns while studying in Paris, being French is not the
same as being a French colonial. "The first thing which the native
learns" writes Fanon as a result of his learning his 'lesson' in Paris,
"is to stay in his place, and not to go beyond certain limits. \[...\]
[The settlers' world is a hostile world, which spurns the native, but at
the same time, is a world of which he is envious" (Fanon, 2001: 40-41).
So Fanon describes the inner conflicts and contradictions created by
colonisation in the colonised. The point I'm making is this; Be it
coloniser or native, the object of the State is to control people and
maintain the existing hegemonic order. From the State's perspective, the
body of a native is no less significant than the body of the coloniser,
both must be disciplined as well as enabled, for social order depends on
every individual playing their respective part to perpetuate the
colonial world]{.underline}. As long as either have the capacity to
threaten colonial rule, the State must discipline, reinforce and reward
individual behaviour. Even in colonial States, the body of the
individual is the focus of State attention. The imaginary slice of life
at 1900 I am trying to portrayvi suggests that although there are clear
stratifications in forms of identity and propriety attributed to
individuals depending on colour, gender, race, inheritance, and social
status, the individual remains the crucial pivot around which both the
Nation and the State organise themselves. Individuals also retained a
central role in the formation and ongoing (re)production of society.
This centrality made the individual the target and the goal of society's
sometimes perfunctory moves towards community. [In contrast to society,
the Nation-State, on the other hand, asks more of individuals than mere
participation in daily routines of social renewal. Nation-States demand
the individual's subjectification to a universal rule of law, coded
rules that reinforce the Nation-State's hegemony]{.underline}. The
willingness of the State to resort to violence (see Agamben 2005,
Benjamin's "Critique of Violence" in Eiland and Jennings 2006, Clastres'
"Of Ethnocide" 1994, and Foucault 2010) to enforce the individual's
subjectification indicates both the seriousness of the State's intention
to unify the Nation as well as its determination to subdue threatening,
oppositional, counter-hegemonic rationalities and ideologies. If the
State's role can be thought of as a servant that maintains discipline
and reduce the threat of change, the Nation, in contrast to both society
and the State, appears to establish and unify a singular notion of
identity -- the formation of "the people". Thus while the world in 1900
subjectified individuals according to and depending on where they stood
in the global stratifications of different States and Nations, the
individual's role in the formation and renewal of society and the social
bonds and cultural relations to establish and maintain social order
remained both central and necessary. Even marginal, insignificant
individuals played a crucial role even if only as the subject of
discipline, or, less commonlt, as a vehicle for social change and
re/evolution. So the nature of society at the beginning of the 20th
century still relied on and reflected the centrality of individuals and
communities. That centrality was characteristic of both modern as well
as traditional society during the first half of the 20th century and was
reflected in the highest form of human organisation at the time, the
Nation-State. So, it can be said, the institutions making up the
Nation-State were entirely motivated by and responded to the biological
imperatives that they were established to facilitate. [Secondly, the
Nation-State had, by 1900, become the highest singular authority that
individuals and collectives could recourse to in either asserting their
assumed rights or in defence against incursions upon those rights by
others]{.underline}. Just as individuals were the focus of the
NationState's attention, so the Nation-State became the focus and at the
same time most powerful arbiter and guarantor of individuals interests,
welfare, safety, and what gradually became regarded as rights. **[As
long as the individual's biology, that is, the quanta of sentient
existence and not just the chemical and molecular processes that
conventions of biology often prescribe, remained central to society, so
the Nation-State directed itself at serving and responding to
individuals biological essentials. Nowhere was this more evident than in
production. Since time immemorial, production essentially focused on
satisfying the material, psychological, environmental, cultural, and
physical needs and so promote individual wellbeing and benefit society
as a whole.]{.underline}** The welfare of specific individuals and the
classes from which they came, such as slaves and colonial natives, the
labouring classes, women, and children, not to mention the preservation
of a hospitable environment for people to exist in, were, however,
elaborated in and by the means and modes of production. **[While the
logics of production attributed higher and lower priorities to
individuals depending on their status, the object of the Nation-State
remained focused on maintaining the interests of living individual
organisms.]{.underline}**

### L -- Cybersecurity

#### Cybersecurity discourses ignore and expand the infiltration of the cybersphere by deterritorializing flows of capitalist governance constitutive of Empire

// ELog

China's stance on cyber governance marks a different way of thinking and
praxis, but it should be viewed not in a binary relationship to the
Global North but as intertwined with historical, geopolitical, and
epistemological power relations (Wasserman, 2018). Borrowing from
postcolonial infrastructure studies, critical algorithm studies, and
internet histories, we use the cybersphere---defined as a historical
ensemble of material, organizational, regulatory, and socio-cultural
layers of communicative relations among populations, machines, and
institutions developed across scales---as a substitute for cyberspace,
to challenge the digital sublime and to underscore its emergent
geopolitical nature. [[The digital sublime]{.mark}, whose influence has
waned but is not finished, [sees cyberspace as a
de-territorialized]{.mark} virtual [global village]{.mark} (Johnson &
Post, 1996). Its mistake lies in [exaggerating]{.mark} the [social
freedom]{.mark} to link and to exchange [by rendering cyberspace
as]{.mark} a [natural]{.mark} given, [rather]{.mark} than a
[geopolitical]{.mark} sphere. Enacted as a top-down model,
[cyberspace]{.mark} has been used to [smuggle in universal norms]{.mark}
that do not recognize historical struggle.]{.underline} The cybersphere,
however, entails both materiality and relationality (Cooren, 2018). It
entails not just virtual reality but material grounding. Power bases,
storage, and server locations are one thing; the interconnection of
information and things added by 5 G mobile networks, quite another.
[Furthermore, the cybersphere shapes, and is shaped by, relational
dynamics. It [mediates labor]{.mark} relations, [production]{.mark}
chains, innovative [resources, knowledge]{.mark} production capacities,
[and]{.mark} human [relations with environment]{.mark} (Aouragh &
Chakravartty, 2016; Murdock, 2018; Srinivasan, 2017).]{.underline}
Extending political economies and expressing power relations, the sphere
has selectively amalgamated national, material, and territorial spaces
on the one hand, and virtual networks of digital data exchange on the
other. It features both interdependence and discontinuity, blending
functional flows, spatial fragments, and social segments (Castells,
2010). In the cybersphere, the continuity and discontinuity of political
economies are named and arranged by discourse for exchange, forming
disagreement spaces that "express differences, disrupt convention, and
field imagined alternatives" (Jackson, 2015; Liu & Goodnight, 2016).
Notably, the assemblage of policies, organizations, and material
structures that underpin the socio-spatial logic of networks and
networking is such a focal site of struggles over ideas, interests, and
power across scales and units. [If the old romantic thinking of
[cyberspace as]{.mark} a separate realm [subject]{.mark} only
[to]{.mark} community-supported [self-regulation]{.mark} has long [lost
its force]{.mark} (Goldsmith & Wu, 2006), [the multi-stakeholder model
that]{.mark} has ever since [prevailed evokes pluralistic participation
but evades national sovereignty and hierarchical power]{.mark} (Mueller,
2010), even implicitly extending Northern bias against redistributive
and developmental deficits (Chakravartty, 2007).]{.underline} Such
failure ignites alternative politics centered on sovereign authorities,
after decades of neoliberal regulatory reforms. Instead of being a
natural space of unity or inevitability, the cybersphere--- which
entangles political economies and disagreement spaces, national and
international relations, virtual and material ties---has evolved into an
expanded geopolitics. Its boundaries and sources of authority are fought
over by different groups and are therefore intrinsically political
(Kristof, 1960). Various spaces have already shaped but do not define
the cybersphere. History shows that states and societies make their own
interpretations amidst global techno-economic trends--- depending on
their values, interests, and capacities. The most notable is the Sino-US
digital interdependence and discontinuity. [[The US]{.mark} has
[made]{.mark} foreign policy [efforts to extend the liberal capitalist
model to cyberspace]{.mark}, but China has preserved some crucial
political-economic and ideational foundations for selfdetermination
despite its steadfast global digital convergence (Hong, 2017; Kiggins,
2012).]{.underline} Still, beneath the foreground of apparent variation
lies the shared background of material ties and relational dynamics that
defy binary distinctions. China's internet has been conventionally
rendered in the state territorial imaginary (Shen, 2017). [By portraying
[a contest-and-conquest relationship]{.mark} between the state
[preoccupied with]{.mark} regime [insecurity]{.mark} and varying social
usages, the dual foci implicitly frame [the Chinese]{.mark} Intranet
[against the globalist internet]{.mark} (King, Pan, & Roberts, 2013;
Rauchfleisch & Sch€afer, 2015).]{.underline} Whereas the latter
associates its governance with the presumably pluralistic, fragmented,
and competitive societies of Western democracy, the former illustrates
the will of the state and the structures of state control. Indeed,
although contested and compromised, the efficacy of state control has
legitimized deploying the Great Firewall as a synecdoche for China's
internet governance (MacKinnon, 2011; Wei, 2017). Political economy
frames a different cyber imaginary, one that loosens this stark
dichotomy. Critical studies suggest that states co-exist with non-state
agents in shaping the global internet and that the influence of
ownership, policies, laws, and commercial interests renders the idea of
a "singular virtual space" misleading (Graham, 2013). Cast in light of
the cybersphere, China's so-called Intranet also reveals entanglements
with foreign capital, foreign technology, foreign markets, and foreign
labor. [Rather than hold up "highly conservative" telecoms policy or
exemplify "cyber-conservatives" (Mueller, 2010; Zeng, Stevens, & Chen,
2017), [the state has unleashed]{.mark} different sequences of
liberalization, decisively exposing its share of [the cybersphere to the
dynamics of global digital capitalism]{.mark} (Hong, 2017; Schiller,
2014).]{.underline} Symbolic, cultural, and social dimensions are also
folded into the cybersphere. From blogging to social networking to
e-commerce, the platformization of cyberspace is structured by bottom-up
vitalities, which sustain and derail top-down governance (Yang, 2003;
Yu, 2017). [Shaping and shaped by actors of the political economy,
including states, markets, and societies, [the cybersphere]{.mark}
continues to [extend social relations]{.mark} and material structures
[across boundaries]{.mark}, be they spatial, temporal, material,
corporeal, or social.]{.underline} Its ubiquitous expansion, accelerated
by the Internet of Things, the Internet of Bodies, and 5 G mobile
networks, has enmeshed the state in a "variable geometry" of wills,
interests, and values and even overwhelms it with torrents of capital,
technology, information, and communication (Castells, 2010, p. 53). If
it is true that "statism disintegrated in contact with new information
technologies," as Manuel Castells wrote in the Information Age trilogy,
does the exercise of cyber sovereignty mark an orchestrated reaction of
the state? What kind of state? And how? [[This brings back the state as
a strategic actor in]{.mark} the [generally "stateless" internet
studies]{.mark} (Flew, 2018).]{.underline} Rethinking the state in
transnational digital political economy China's official vision
regarding the state's authority over internet-related public policy
differs from the Western liberal model, and not only in the sense of
opposing individualist democracies and authoritarian states. China's
communication policies persist as a dialectic between incumbent powers
that own, regulate, and change the organizational apparatuses and
material structures of communications and emergent powers that use,
extend, and innovate counter-orders. Thus, the approach here is not to
dissolve the state-centric framework, nor do we suggest an economic
cosmopolitan account to replace the national framing. [However, [as an
alternative to the ontological fracture]{.mark} between the state as a
mutually exclusive territorial monopoly on the use of force, on the one
hand, and market forces and individual rights that can be universally
applied, on the other, [we]{.mark} do want to deabstract the state---to
[see the state as mutually constituting]{.mark}, and frictionally
meshing, with [a broader network of power materialized by the
cybersphere]{.mark}.]{.underline} This statement, along with the
replacement of cyberspace by cybersphere, has implications for the
theory of the state. A decades-long debate between liberal and Marxist
strains of state theories has bearing on the state's positioning in the
cybersphere. Embedded in social science disciplines from the postwar
era, the liberal theory of politics posits that power in Western
democratic societies is diffused enough; the state responds to competing
demands, rendering Marxist class-based notions, such as ruling class and
corporate power, irrelevant (Miliband, 2009). Having rightfully
constructed a liberal critique of traditional authoritarianism and even
networked authoritarianism, this "class-less" thinking of pluralistic
politics nevertheless leads to the obfuscation of state-society
interlinks and thus unduly precluding capitalist, developmental, and
legitimacy-seeking logics of the state---before and after the arrival of
the networked digital age. At the international level, liberal and
realist theories treat states as unitary and autonomous actors. In the
case of China, national factors still offer compelling explanations for
its performance---as the Chinese state rejected the outright Washington
Consensus and has paced global integration. Still, this state-led global
convergence created unexpected results and has fostered transnational
imperatives from inside. [Therefore, [instead of deducing]{.mark} the
logic of [state actions from]{.mark} its arguably timeless essence of
[security and control, it is imperative to see the state]{.mark}'s
wills, interests, values, and practices [as]{.mark} relationally
[intertwined with global and marketbased structures of power]{.mark} and
to appreciate the crosscutting of state agendas by various transnational
interests across multiple scales.]{.underline} The neoliberal turn from
the 1970s advanced the notion that it is desirable, and even feasible,
to separate politics from economics, states from markets (Panitch,
2009). This fracture reflects neither the intervention-and-investment
the US government makes in the internet nor the accommodations the
Chinese state makes toward global techno-economic trends. Meanwhile,
postwar neo-Marxist state theory has resisted reducing state interests
and capacities to servitude for capital and instead notes the historical
makeup of social forces and recognizes the state's relative autonomy
(Starrs, 2017). Extending this critical perspective, the political
economy approach to communication examines historically specific
relations between states, markets, and social actors and explores how
these factors parlay into structural, institutional, and discursive
transformations of international/national policy-making (Chakravartty &
Sarikakis, 2006). The cybersphere adds a new twist to the dynamics of
the state. To reckon the recursive relationship between the state and
the cybersphere, a holistic conception and historiography of the state
should be framed. The transition literature on China notes that the
formerly Leninist state has internalized a liberal orientation and even
moved to a globally integrated model of policy process (Fewsmith, 2010).
The state-led capitalist socio-economic transition has accelerated in
and through the cybersphere but spurs intensive social dissent, which
invites an ever-expanding state information control regime (Zhao, 2008).
Thus, after having alternately unleashed, shaped, and stalled the
cybersphere that extends change and disturbance, the party state becomes
a major contested site as well as a contesting subject. Notably, the
party state can adapt, contract, or expand its power over the
cybersphere. The state under Xi's leadership generates sweeping
transformative initiatives, holding China at an "inflection point": the
post-WWII capitalist order is mired in chronic crises; the party
state-led China continues to grow stronger, after weathering market
reforms; therefore, the responses to global crises must be organized to
achieve the millennial mission of national rejuvenation (Economy, 2018).
Pivoting to developing digital economy, digital government, and digital
society, the state attempts to re-organize the symbolic protocols,
social norms, or economic organizations that have hitherto defined the
cybersphere, taking cyber sovereignty as a salient position. Despite the
state's transformative agency, a more fundamental dialectic between
geopolitics and globalization has been at work, altering the state's
will and dispersing its capacity. [As the driver of globalization,
[capitalist development transcends national boundaries through the
cybersphere]{.mark}, inducing states to facilitate internet development
and commercialization (Simpson, 2004).]{.underline} However,
globalization as such, mediated by states and geopolitics, is never a
completely finished set of projects. Developing states are strategic
actors in contesting the global order---increasingly in and through the
cybersphere (Desai, 2013). Still, states cannot afford alienating
capitalist logic too much, as contemporary geopolitics is increasingly
tied with inter-capitalist competition (Woodley, 2015). The cybersphere
also deepens the state's entanglement in the multilateral order of
interdependence. While the state can act on its transformative
initiatives, it is variably involved in ad hoc networks with
subnational, national, and international actors and must "ensure the
balance and power of the network state to which they belong" (Castells,
2010, p. 361). When the US government asserts unilateralism over
bilateral and multilateral issues at the cost of losing global moral
appeal, and when the field of internet governance features layered,
diffuse, and even privatized control of power (DeNardis, 2014), China's
position is likely to oscillate between reclaiming state sovereignty and
supporting shared sovereignty. Thus, the internet is a new sphere, where
the state extends political authority, prioritizes certain rights,
responds to capitalist cycles, and enters a multilateral
interdependence. [[It endorses]{.mark} and acts on [contradictory
initiatives,]{.mark} mostly [within the capitalist global order]{.mark}.
These range [from subsuming the directionless logic of capital]{.mark}
to the territorial logic of the state to facilitating transnational
capital accumulation; from strengthening the social and symbolic
foundation of the party's rule to [encouraging the digital turn of
globalization; and]{.mark} from promoting itself as a champion of
globalization to [sponsoring]{.mark} regional factions and [domestic
protectionism]{.mark}.]{.underline} The mixture is an empirical
question, which nevertheless cannot be exhausted by the control
protocols of the state---authoritarian or liberal democratic---but is
conditioned by the dialectics between the intra-national needs the state
prioritizes and the global legitimacy and sphere sustainability the
state seeks. The following section addresses how to qualify, rather than
reify, the cyber sovereignty mandate. Cyber sovereignty in historical
perspectives Sovereignty, in its modern conception, "implies a theory of
politics which claims that in every system of government there must be
some absolute power of final decision" (Crick, 1968). [Territoriality
strongly defines sovereignty (Betz & Stevens, 2011), but this definition
obscures the fact that [sovereignty is both territorially and
non-territorially circumscribed]{.mark}.]{.underline} From a standpoint
of political economy of communication, the status of sovereignty works,
out of and against, a disagreement space crossing boundaries and denotes
the state with questions of who has standing and controls resources for
decisions over senders, receivers, codes, messages, channels, audiences,
and feedback. Claims to sovereignty offer an index of power relations
among nations and register the spread of capitalism, as well as the
geopolitical pressure and popular resistance that follows (Desai, 2013).
A historical association of communication with capitalist states means
that the principle of territorialized sovereignty, when put in practice,
has incorporated the need to trade, to flow, and to invest. [Hence,
[globalization]{.mark} from the 1990s [has not linearly undermined the
state but]{.mark} has [further complicated the relationship
between]{.mark} a bounded physical [territory and the]{.mark} state as
the presumably [supreme authority]{.mark} therein---as sovereignty
operated through multiple spatial modes, and non-state actors even
shared the operation of sovereignty (Agnew, 2009).]{.underline} This
proposition applies to China. Despite its stance to push against
hegemonic intervention, sovereignty is in no way unyielding in the
postMao era (Carlson, 2005). A new school of international relations,
intent to qualify the diluted but still crucial role of
sovereignty-based states in the age of globalization, disaggregates
sovereignty into multiple components, foregrounding multiple yet
inconsistent practices of redefining sovereignty (Biersteker & Weber,
1996). As the cybersphere extends globalization, how does it redefine
sovereignty? [Adopting Krasner's concepts (Krasner, 1999), Betz and
Stevens (2011) argued that [the internet compromises]{.mark} the
[regulation of cross-border flows]{.mark}, or so-called "interdependence
sovereignty," [which]{.mark} further [weakens]{.mark} Westphalian
constructs and [domestic authority; yet, it does not affect]{.mark} the
legal integrity of states in [international law]{.mark}, which means
that states persist.]{.underline} Still, if the cybersphere is not
universally experienced, the re-configuration of sovereignty is not a
homogenous process either. Two trends vie for acceptance. First,
sovereign relations are being worked out with a great range of
variation. [The [US]{.mark} government [has supported a
presumably]{.mark} benevolent and borderless [corporat]{.mark}e-run
[cyberspace. However, its security rhetoric, which transcends]{.mark}
the distinction between [inside and outside, legitimizes]{.mark} an
[empire]{.mark} model, wherein military capacity is kept constant and
co-extensive with its global networks (Hardt & Negri, 2000;
Katin-Borland, 2012).]{.underline} Still, even a US-based Leviathan is
not immune from cyber-attacks. As fake news, internet-enabled theft and
disruption, and cyber weapons have shaken the American internet, a
Foreign Affairs commentary proclaimed that "state sovereignty is alive
and well on the Internet" (Flournoy & Sulmeyer, 2018, para. 4). In an
emergent counter-position, the EU uses privacy as a lever to rein in
Silicon Valley-originated platforms (Dijck, 2013). However, this
rights-based cyber sovereignty in no way negates strong strategic
purpose (Pohle, 2019). If the tension between users and corporations
obscures the roles of states in liberal democratic contexts, the Chinese
state plays a salient role in ousting Western platforms, blocking IP
addresses, silencing dissent, and orchestrating propaganda campaigns to
the extent that Western security and policy studies conveniently equate
a cyber-sovereignty position with coherent statist control ( Tai, 2017;
See Harold, 2016 ). Yet, despite the state's sustained efforts to
control the flow of information to its people, the bigger picture is
more complex. To participate in the cybersphere, the state both
practices negative proscription, such as censorship, and makes proactive
moves to legalize non-state forces. To the extent that states unleash
the cybersphere, states and the cybersphere then become co-constituting
(Kohl & Fox, 2017). A state generally deploys its sovereign power to
project national interests and to bolster certain values, interests, and
projects. The cybersphere modifies this equation to the extent that
sovereign power is no longer a status that states can either own or not.
Vulnerability and interdependence are built into a cyber-committed
nation. First, as the internet's choke points often transcend state
jurisdictions, it is inconceivable to squeeze the transnational nature
of technical standards, supply chains, material and virtual
architectures, and multidirectional communicative activities all into
traditional jurisdictions (Kohl, 2007). Second, if internet governance
is mostly enacted through technical design, private corporations, and
nongovernmental organizations (DeNardis, 2014), the specific governance
structure in China expresses its unique global history. Still, the
Chinese state must negotiate with supranational entities, corporate
infrastructures, and networked publics. Third, the prosperity of a
digital ecosystem driven jointly by expressive, productive, and
commercial energy challenges the ability of the state to define
information flows in distributed networks (Navarria, 2016). Embedded in
this sphere, state policies are subjected to ideational, institutional,
and material contestations---within the country and without. On what
terms, then, and in what mode can states seek to redefine cyber
sovereignty? Ideally, as the cybersphere has become the dominant medium
of global and public communication, the deployment of cyber sovereignty
as a heuristic device would reveal, and even encourage, a disagreement
space for peaceful negotiation among states, whose networking,
competition, and collaboration inevitably interact with the
non-traditional power structures made up of private companies, expert
groups, civic organizations, and institutional and individual users. As
the Chinese state advocates cyber sovereignty and globalization at once,
how is it expressing this set of goals through concrete constructing
practices? In the following, we examine China's institutional and
normative vocabularies that organize material governance of cyber
sovereignty, trace these into the international realm as a case for
global connectivity and relationship development, then review domestic,
negotiated policies designed to work through disagreements, leveraging
domestic ends against China's standing in a global cybersphere.

### L -- Digital Economy

#### The 1AC's sanctimonious insistence on benevolent cyber development to help the "lesser developed nations" is a Janus-faced promise that only brings these nations from the periphery to the front stage of the worldwide digital economy. Geopolitics has evolved from annihilation to assimilation where the non-western world is incorporated into the ever-expanding empire of IR.

**[The international community is currently involved in a new digital
information era. The worldwide digital economy is fundamentally relied
on the diverse cryptographic processes, virtuality phenomenon gains on
the popularity(Chang, 2017; North & North, 2016; Lau & Lee, 2015; Nardi,
2015; Bombari, 2015). International political, economic and
socio-cultural structures exist in a virtual mode (Baylis, 2011) and are
socially constructed]{.underline}** (Wendt, 1999; Katzenstein, 1996).
Development mechanisms of the international system are based on
hybridity (Acharya, 2017). [The dissemination of representational
systems of social meanings and cultural valuesvia popular mass media
resources may serve the form ofinternational cooperation]{.underline}
(Constantinou, 2018).Advanced technological equipment that projects
virtual reality spaces within global international environment is widely
distributed. International markets, information infrastructures
inter-unite individuals on the global international stage. Visual
representations serve the means of shaping individuals\` interestsin the
global internationalcommunities with an emphasis on the type of
technical equipment that is capable to produce virtual reality expanse
in a certain area and region(Constantinou, 2018). **[Artificial worlds
presented in simulated virtual realm also affect digital marketing
strategies (Zanni& Rios, 2018; Lin &Rauschnabel, 2015) in a global
social context andconsolidate representatives of the international cyber
society into discrete interest groups]{.underline}**. Popular online
mass media platforms are persistently growing in prominence among
youngpeople (Goodyear, Armour& Wood, 2018; Swist, et al., 2015). Such
platforms become a feasible mediator among interest groups in the global
international level(Leavey, 2013; Margetts, 2009). In this connection,
it makes sense to argue, that global cyberspace and online virtual
platforms serve theappropriate environment forinternational
communication and cooperation. [Such environment creates the appropriate
platform for international cooperation and future developmentof the
international system from a global perspective, as the distribution of
consolidating social content may influence and shape actors\` interests
and integrate them and their strategies of behavior]{.underline}. By
means of promoting consolidating social contentsadpted to
thetechnological landscape incertain geographical areas may integrate
individual actors on the international stage and diverse social groups.
However, the promotion of certain type of virtuality content with
emphasized commonalities of shared systems of meanings via global
cyberspace adopted to the technical environment in a local area has not
been considered the constituent part of the global
internationaldevelopment according to the geopolitics of cyberspace
strategyyet. The paper focuses the global virtual environment an
appropriateinternational platform for geopolitics of cyberspace
implementation via adopting the virtuality with its content and
representation of intersubjectivity as the discrete form of
internationally unitingsocial power and platform for global
communication. To achieve the objective, the paper focuses on the
concepts of cyberspace and cybercartography. This is followed by the
proposition of transformed Wallerstein\`s theory as the contemporary
structure of the world-system. This is followed by consideration of a
virtual poweras the means of geopolitics of cyberspace strategy, with a
particular attention on developing gaming industry. 2. Cyberspace as
global virtual [environment The globally spread networking systems have
influenced the essential processes of humanity existence on micro and
macro levels. They synchronize basic human life processes across
geographical boundaries, time zones and cultural
prejudices.]{.underline} Social relations have already been hybridized
into offline and online environments (Serrano-Puche, 2016). **[Global
cyberspace integrates people all over the world into one common
cyberspace community that is comprised of information infrastructures.
Interest communities are internationally interconnected within online
spaces and virtual platforms. The structure of contemporary
international systemis constructed by social ideas (Baylis,
2011)]{.underline}**.The concept may be interpreted as digital
libertarianism as important characteristic of postmodern society.Many
individuals spend a significant part of their conscious day in virtual
reality spaces. Naím (2005) argues that essential communicative
transactions today proceed among individuals in the global networking
virtual space, so that an individual is considered an actor on the
international stage. The Actor-Network theory focuses the exploratory
consideration of social relations and various interaction modalities in
global networking world. The Actor-Network theory has become
increasingly prominent within the international relations discipline and
political sciences (Lezaun, 2017; Bencherki, 2017). **[In this
connection, the global cyberspace serves a strategic platform for social
integration and communication on the international stage. The definition
of cyberspace initially refers to a multichannel widespread,
interconnected digital technology system that creates a notional global
environment in which communication over computer networks occurs.
Subsequently, the virtual environment in which communication over
computer networks is implemented can be understood as concept of
cyberspace.]{.underline}** Cyberspace can also be defined as avirtual
environment in which communication over computer networks occurs. The
cyberspace term also refers to a virtualized computer world and
electronic medium (Kneale, 1999). Cyberspace is created by a global
computer networking system and serves the facilitation of interaction
and transaction processes.The term is currently used by technology
strategists, industrial security representatives, in formal speeches and
entrepreneurs to describe the domain of the global technology
environment. The term cyberspace is related to the notion of
cybernetics. The notion is traditionally understood as the science of
the general laws of information change within complex systems. Wiener
has defined cybernetics as the science of communication, based on
human-computed interaction studies (Wiener, 1948). Cybernetic studies in
this connection are associated with general laws of networking processes
that occur within complex dynamic transformation systems of social
nature (Wiener, 1948).A number of contemporary cyberpschycological
studies are devoted to the exploration of computer-mediated
communication (Parker, 2007; Huber, 2006; Muhlberger, et al., 2005;
Galimberti&Belloni, 2003). [Cybernetics and networking information
infrastructures generate global virtual cyberspace that is considered
theglobal virtual field of action. Currently, the international system
is partially constructed and influenced by the spread of global virtual
cyberspace. It makes sense to argue that in such type of a system data
visualization and digital technological equipment remain the components
of information infrastructure basis and enable the cyberspace existence.
In this connection, these constituents of global communication can be
considered the two main strategic resources for dissemination of
internationally uniting virtual social contents on global
level]{.underline}. The increasingly significant place in the
international relations discourse currently take the debates on
Geocybernetics (Phillips, 2016; Paras, 2007; Reyes, Taylor & Martinez,
2006).**[Cybersecurity is considered the top of international agenda
(Kuranda, 2018). The geocybernetics term refers to scientific
perspective of the general laws of information change within a global
complex networking systems (Stangu,2010).]{.underline}** Geocybernetics
is a scientific discipline that focuses the exploratory regulation
principles of global interconnected action systems on the basis of
general mathematical laws and management regulations (Stangu,
2010).Physical geography of cyberspace or geo cyber cartography (Taylor
&Caquard, 2006; Reyes & Martinez, 2005; Jiang &Ormeling, 2000) deals
with technological equipment of all types. This aspect can be considered
to serve an appropriate platform that can enable distribution of
virtualityin a certain geographical region. Visualization of cyber
cartography (Hecht, et al., 2011) and geographical hypermedia (Crampton,
2009) are considered the epistemology of science. Batty (1977) and
Goodchild (1990) argue that virtual geography is a field of new media
convergence. CentroGeo's Scientific Project with its cybernetic
character was developed to focus the Scientific Management Model (SMM)
(Jeong, &Barabasi, 1999). The SMM as a scientific strategy that
constitutes of four blocks: human networking, heterarchical groups, a
method to approach knowledge production and the international level
(Reyes & Paras, 1999). There was produced the three-dimensional
hyperbolic visualization of Internet topologies (CAIDA). [The model can
be considered an innovative mode of knowledge production with a
cybernetic character based on the science of geocybernetics. The main
focus of the developed model is on communication and cognition processes
of user\`s interaction strategies within the global networking system in
accordance with cybernetics (Reyes & Paras, 1999]{.underline}). There
were also invented cartographic mode maps that display information
infrastructures in their global scale, and infrastructures in certain
geographic areas (the Helsinki metropolitan area, the west LondonM4
corridor, Silicon Valley). Via distributing virtual representations
through the multichannel expanse of global cyberspace there should be
payed a particular attention on its adoption to the technical equipment
availability in a certain geographic region.There were already developed
cyber cartography atlases of digital ethnography that display digital
logistical infrastructure and material properties of communicational
environment in a certain geographic area(Grubesic & Murray, 2005a;
Grubesic & Murray, 2005b). Geographic maps are developed to indicate and
produce the visual map-like interfaces into online virtual spaces
(Grubesic & Murray, 2005a; Grubesic & Murray, 2005b).These aspects can
be utilized to enable the effective international social interaction and
communication and serve the basis for developing elaboration strategies
for the international future cooperation and development. In addition,
the globalized networking cyberspace does not have anarchical
configuration. The international cyberspace may be represented as
intersubjective virtual unit constructed with certain informational
zones and information infrastructures that are interconnected among one
another. The developed design of the virtual world map and global
cyberspace as the significant part of contemporary world division may
serve the global international platform for global communication and
digital cooperation, international consolidation of discrete societies.
Online platforms may be considered the sustainable basis for future
international cooperation and development. 3 Transformed Wallerstein\`s
theory There had been held several debates on world-system structure
theories based on division of the global system on center-periphery
relation paradigms (Mathias, Buzan &Zürn, 2013). [The fundamental
perspectives of a world-system division on center-periphery relation
paradigms in the traditional international relations theories were
presented by Onuf (2017), Galtung (1971) and Wallerstein (1974).
Wallerstein (2004) presented an inter-regional world-system theory which
is based on categorization of nation states as power units]{.underline}.
The division is based on the analysis of various economic areas
division. He contributes three main world categories of core,
semi-periphery and periphery, according to the nation state\`s relative
position within the world economy. According to Wallerstein (2004) core
nations are represented with more complex state institutions that
provide infrastructures with economic diversification, centralized
governmental structure and specialize on information industry
improvement. The distinctive feature of core nation states is their
financial and military dominance in the international system.
[Wallerstein defines Canada, Australia, the United States, England,
France, Netherlands as the category of core states. The peripheral
nations are presented with Latin America and sub-Saharan
Africa]{.underline}. The distinctive feature of this category is defined
as weakly functioning institutional systems, high level of social
inequality and poor economic diversification. The category of
Semi-peripheral nation states can be represented by nation states that
cannot be classified neither as core, nor as periphery. [Currently, the
status of semi peripheral nation states have BRICS countries, Israel,
and South Korea.]{.underline} Otherwise, there also should be took into
consideration the availability of digital technologies, media
technologies in a certain region. Information infrastructures that
constructs the essential basis for global cyberspace existence as any
kind of social structure also serves the catalyst for economic
development in a certain region. Italso does make sense to argue that
each geographic area is distinct with a special type of technical
equipment, with each area having its unique technological landscape and
potential for economic development in the future. Core can be considered
as a geographic region with widely-spreaddeveloped technological
equipment on its whole territory. The individuals dispose on such
territory the latest digital technological units, have the access to the
global international cyberspace and are actively involved into multiple
international cooperation. Periphery should be understood as the
geographical regions on the surface of the Earth that were not, or
almost not, absorbed by globalization processes, individuals on these
territories almost don\`t dispose the technical equipment and have the
lack of access to the global international community. Periphery regions
are also distinct with the lack of access to the education. On the
periphery territories there isa lack of access to electricity and
energy. [Individuals that are located on the periphery territories have
small access to available mass-media resources and to the global
networking cyberspace, so that they are enable to be involved into
global international development processes and have difficulties with
access to the educational online programs.]{.underline} **[While
considering regions of periphery it's important to take into account the
lack of electricalaccessibility in those regions, which is considered a
significant constituent for geopolitics of cyberspace future
development]{.underline}**. The absence of electricity enables the
expanse of networking communications, the Internet within geographical
area. This aspect also influences the type of technical equipment in the
regional location. For instance, according toThe Harvard Forum I
Research ICTdue to the lack of electrical power in African regions, 75%
of mobile-phone users spend around 11%-27% of their household income on
mobile communications (Ishkanian, 2011). Insurrectional movements in
north Africa region and middle east raise up considerations on new
communication technologies as sustainable development source in
democratic world (Ishkanian, 2011). Each geographic area on the world
map, where advanced technological equipment is spread enough to create
the virtual cyberspace corresponds to the semi-periphery. Otherwise, the
online activities of individuals located on the Semi-Periphery
territories are not so extensive as on the core territories, so that the
complete involvement into international online cooperation might be
difficult. To the semi-periphery territories there may refer
industrializing and developing world regions. Within these territories
individuals dispose information technologies and technical equipment,
although, the intense of their operations in online spaces and
involvement to the global development and cooperation is not such
intensive as on the territories of core. 4 Intersubjectivity intra
cyberspace The basic social constructivism assumption stipulates and
emphasizes the significance of intersubjectivity of social meanings. The
notion stipulates a common system of social meanings that is shared
among the members of a certain social group (Rogoff, 1990). The
intersubjectivity, as a social constructivism concept, represented by
the common system of social meanings and shared knowledge with a common
social context and background (Prawat&Floden, 1994). Every system of
common shared meanings is supported by a virtue of social interactions
and communications among individuals also in a virtual space. As a
result of social interactions and communications among the group members
there occur thecommon understanding of basic principles of a discrete
social reality space (Ernest, 1999). Intersubjectivity also serves the
prism for new information interpretation in a particular society
(Rogoff, 1990). The virtual environment faces the international
relations constructivist Agent-Structure problem (Wendt, 1987), although
it occurs in a cyber mode. In this connection, international virtual
platforms may promote the similar systems of social meanings and
consolidate the international community and discrete social groups
around the world. The intersubjectivity promoted via virtual spacesis
considered a vehicle for social interaction processes and information
transmission among the group members in the international societies. So
that, each community has the unique socio-cultural basis with promoted
system of social values. The common intersubjectivity of social
meaningspromoted via discrete online communities may consolidate
andinterconnect discrete communities with one another via international
global cyberspace.**[The reflection of intersubjectivities with an
emphasis of their commonalities promoted via virtual environments may
consolidate and incorporate people around the world. The unification on
communication platforms in the global cyberspace and promotion of common
systems of social meanings and intersubjectivity, in this connection, is
considered to serve the internationally consolidating aspect and the
appropriate platform for international cooperation and
futuredevelopment]{.underline}**. 5 Virtual power and cooperationvia
global cyberspace Traditionally, the concept of social poweris
associated with a corpus of modalities that function as a machinery for
social classes\` conviction (Purvis & Hunt, 1993). Social power can also
be understood as the complex system of prevalent norms and social values
that function as a mechanism of individuals\` persuasion to a certain
kind of social structure maintenance (Laclau& Chantal, 2001). Debord
(1994) argues that a significant role incontemporary societies is played
by promoted imagery representations. The significant attention can be
payed to the roleof mass media resources in each geographic area as they
serve a considerable part of social strategies (Altheide,
1984).Straubhaar (1991)determinates the concept of social power in the
international relations as the interdependence relationship
amongnation-state units, with each of them having its own political,
economic, and cultural background and social basis. The social power
concept takes its roots in Gramsci's differentiating between concurrence
as a mode of social power force in industrial societies (Gramsci, 1992).
Gramsci argues that mass-media resources can influence the
people\`spolitical, economic preferences and their perception of
discrete systems of cultural values(Lears, 1985).According to Gramsci,
social strategies in a modern society maybe supported d by the means
ofinformationspread(Lears, 1985). Foucault (1980) considers the Internet
to be the appropriate platform for social strategiesrepresentation and
support. Ifthe globalized international systemthat nowadays partially
exists in a virtualized form.According to Gramscian perspective (1971),
the social strategies in modern societies may be also influenced by
means of promoted information. The global cyberspace can be considered
the uniting international social platform for common spread of systems
of social meanings and representations of intersubjectivity with focus
on their commonalities.At this stagethe interpretative approach of
virtual power concept may be pertinently introduced in its unique
interpretation.The concept of virtual social power for individualsliein
their ability to access the global cyberspace and particular type of
promotedvirtuality that positively influences their perception of
discrete systems of social meanings with their commonalities. Virtual
power concept should be understood asconfiguredvirtuality promotion
within the global virtual environmentof cyberspace with an emphasis on
the popular type of technical equipment in a certain geographic
region.Virtual powermay also promote and cultivate the common systems of
social and cultural values via international cyberspace. Barry Buzan
considers identity and culture as the social security component in terms
of the international perspective (Buzan, 2008; Buzan, 1998; Buzan,
1991). [Consequently, the discrete type of promoted virtuality should
consider the security aspects of each discrete society, particularly,
individuals\` moral discourse, their ethic values, and behavioral
strategies intra objective reality of a discrete space of a geographic
area. Such social power modality might be supported by international
actors in order to promote internationally consolidating ideas on the
global level.]{.underline} Such modality of consolidating social power
is supposed to serve the ultimate integrating international power
distributed via available technological equipment in each region. The
discrete laws for regional counterparts of cyberspaces should be taken
into consideration and respected. The internationally uniting power can
be transmitted within the global international cyberspace in accordance
to already developed cyber cartography atlases in order to distribute
the appropriate type of internationally consolidate ideas within each
geographic region and area.**[Technical equipment and digital
technologies are considered the strategically important source essential
for promotion of social values and cultural ideas. In this regard,
virtual power serves the appropriatestrategic mechanism to unite the
international community via global cyberspace globally]{.underline}**.
The virtuality may be purposefully transmitted within the global
international space via available technical equipment capable to produce
virtual extent in a certain geographic area. In addition, the
international system that partially nowadays exists in a cyberspace mode
can serve the global platform for internationally uniting social
strategies, global communication support and catalyst for international
development. The virtual power can be considered a global
communicationmediator between discrete nation states. This type of power
is disseminated via available technological equipment in acertain region
and geographic area. The appropriate type of available technical
equipment within each discrete geographical territory matters and can be
considered the important aspect while the geopolitics of cyberspace
implementation and development. 6 Geopolitics of cyberspace as
theglobally uniting strategy [The international cyberspace withvirtual
platformsunites the representatives of international community all over
the world. The information infrastructuresenablepeoples\` interactions
on the global level. In this connection, it can be claimed that all the
technical equipment that is able to produce intersubjective virtual
online spaces can be considered the essential component for the
successful geopolitics of cyberspace strategy
implementation]{.underline}. Moreover, the number of personal computers
that are able to support connection to the worldwide network of the
Internet during 1994 increased to 3,217,000 of machines (InterNIC)
(Nunes & College, 1995). The virtuality construction as the product may
be distributed via technological equipment within a particulargeographic
area with an emphasis on social commonalities. There was also an attempt
to support the net politics is The Program on Liberation Technology at
Stanford\'s Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law 2009
(Diamond & Plattner, 2012).ICT development also supports the
distribution of digital technologies (Bonn &Akkermans, 2015), and in
this connection, may be considered the significant constituent for
international development support. These aspects create the sustainable
platform for the international development and future cooperation with
accordance to the geopolitics of cyberspace. Geopolitics of cyberspace
as the internationally uniting global strategy might be also associated
with the phenomenon of virtual poverty and the immaterial labor. The
concept refers to the availability of technical equipment and attributes
of global wealth, such as the affordability of a personal computer and
the broadband connection, which limits the admission to the upper
percentiles of the population majority in the age of twenties and evenly
subdivided by gender in countries of Europe, Japan, and the United
States (Au 2007a, 2007b). Virtual poverty as the phenomenon can
instigate ludocapitalism that reflects the interactive virtual games as
actual power being the coherent apparatus with military and the market
its two pillars (Burston, 2003; Dibbell, 2006). The immaterial labor
invokes the information and communication diversity of procedures, being
the cultural phenomenon or affective element of the commodity (Virno&
Hardt, 1996; Dowling, Nunes, & Trott, 2007; Lazzarato, 1996; Virno&
Hardt, 1996; Hardt &Negri, 2000). Otherwise, it should be taken into
consideration that the role of a nation state is little to prevalently
influence or digital libertarianism in global cyberspace. So that
internationally uniting social strategies should be implemented in
accordance to existing regulations on national level. [The
cybercartography landscape and cyberspace law acknowledgement are
essential to serve the basis forimplementation of efficient
strategies.]{.underline}

The fact that the two spheres are increasingly out of joint, however, is
only part of the story. We need to look more closely at the composition
of each sphere, to gauge its powers and estimate its prospects. We begin
by taking a step back to register how the structures of global order
have changed in the last twenty years, with an eye to how potential
avenues have opened there today for the multitudes that resist and
challenge them. [At the beginning of the 1990s, [after the collapse of
the Soviet Union]{.mark} and as economic, political and cultural
relations were extending in novel ways beyond the reach of national
sovereign powers, [the US]{.mark} President [proclaimed]{.mark} the dawn
of [a new world order]{.mark}. At the time, most supporters and critics
alike took for granted that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, having
emerged 'victorious' from the Cold War [as sole remaining superpower,
would exert]{.mark} its unparalleled [hard and soft power]{.mark},
shouldering ever-more responsibility while [exercising]{.mark}
increasingly [unilateral control]{.mark} over global

// ELog

[[NATO enlargement involves]{.mark} a two-fold legitimation. It rests
firstly on [making NATO]{.mark} everyday and [unremarkable, and]{.mark}
secondly on making it [morally good]{.mark}.]{.underline} The effect is
one of simultaneous banalization and glorification of NATO. [[The
alliance is on]{.mark} the [one hand made so common sense as to
be]{.mark} boring---[below]{.mark} political [debate]{.mark}. It is [on
the other]{.mark} hand [made existential and]{.mark} essential---[above
debate]{.mark}.]{.underline} The first side of this coin of
legitimation---that of banalization---is a key feature of geopolitical
discourses. These discourses rely not as much on formal arguments about
science and strategy as on the notion of common sense (O'Tuathail and
Agnew 1992:193). Their political success stems not from their deep
meaning, but from their dailiness and banality. [[The militarization
of]{.mark} political [debate and everyday life is made possible]{.mark}
in significant measure [by domesticating military power as
everyday]{.mark} (Cohn 1987; Lutz 2001).]{.underline} The
military--industrial complex, or the
military--industrial--media--entertainment network in Der Derian's
(2001) more precise terminology, is made to appear both virtual and
virtuous, both clean and good. Its material infrastructure and material
effects are thereby erased from political debate. [[This is clearly the
case with NATO]{.mark}. [Military terminology is all but absent from
discussions]{.mark} of the world's most powerful military alliance
(Sidaway 2001:602). [It has]{.mark} thus [become]{.mark} acceptable and
indeed [common to speak of war--- such as]{.mark} the one in
[Kosovo]{.mark} in 1999---[as an "operation" concerned with "building
civil society]{.mark}" (see also Feldman 2003; Sidaway
2003).]{.underline} Yet as Arendt (1964:288) famously pointed out over
40 years ago, banal is not synonymous with benign. [[Evil]{.mark} can
[arise]{.mark} not from sinister intent but [from unthinking adherence
to the taken-for-granted]{.mark} (see also Billig 1995; Gregory
2004).]{.underline} To speak of the banality of the military--industrial
complex, then, is not to imply triviality, but to specify its mechanisms
of operation and legitimation. [It is to underscore the "set of [silent
ethical assertions]{.mark} that [pre-organize explicit]{.mark}
ethicopolitical [discourses]{.mark}" (Shapiro 1997:16)---in this case
the assertions [that enable discussions of NATO to revolve
around]{.mark} the notions of right, [peace, culture, and
values]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Enloe (2004:220) points out, most of the
militarization of social life, a process in which social practices gain
value and legitimacy by being associated with military force, occurs in
peacetime. To understand the dynamics of this process, then, we need to
look at the mundane rather than the spectacular, the civilian rather
than the military. [[The]{.mark} second aspect of the [legitimation of
NATO]{.mark}---the constitution of military power [as good---is a key
part of]{.mark} what Hardt and Negri (2000:9) call [the new inscription
of authority]{.mark}.]{.underline} Today's global power relations, they
argue, are based not on force itself, but on the capacity to present
force as being in the service of right and peace. These relations rely
on an "ethico-political dynamic", which envelops the entire space of
what it considers civilization---a boundless, universal space
(ibid.:11). [[This]{.mark} ethico-political dynamic [lays the foundation
for a renewed notion of just war]{.mark}: no longer an activity of
defense or resistance, but one that is justified in itself, [by the
appeal to essential values]{.mark} and justice. [This just war
combines]{.mark} two elements: first, the [legitimacy]{.mark} of the
military apparatus insofar as it is ethically grounded, [and]{.mark}
second, the [effectiveness of military action]{.mark} to achieve the
desired order and peace. The [Empire's powers]{.mark} of intervention do
not [begin]{.mark} directly with its weapons of lethal force but rather
[with its moral instruments]{.mark} (Hardt and Negri
2000:35).]{.underline} They are based on the production of the normative
space of imperial right. Intervention becomes juridically legitimate
only when it is inserted into existing international consensuses. [[The
first task of]{.mark} the [Empire is "to enlarge]{.mark} the realm of
[the consensuses that support its own power]{.mark}"
(ibid.:15).2]{.underline} The military complex becomes a key part of the
production of moral good (see also Flint and Falah 2004 for an in-depth
discussion of the concept of just war). Hardt and Negri conceptualize
this new notion of right as a substantively new phenomenon. In the
earlier disciplinary society, they argue, social power was effected
through administrative apparatuses that produce and regulate customs and
habits. In today's society of control, in contrast, mechanisms of
command become ever more "democratic", ever more immanent in the social
field. The normalizing apparatuses of disciplinary power do not simply
intensify. In addition, and in contrast to disciplinary society, social
control today extends well outside the structured sites of social
institutions through flexible and fluctuating networks (Hardt and Negri
2000:23). [[Power has become biopolitical]{.mark} in that it extends
throughout the depths of the consciousnesses and bodies of the
population. [The new notion of right]{.mark}, then, is not simply
imposed on localities and subjects from the outside. It [is]{.mark}
rather [part and parcel of the]{.mark} very [production of]{.mark}
locality and [subjectivity]{.mark} (Hardt and Negri 2000:30). According
to Hardt and Negri (2004:13), [security is a form of biopower]{.mark} in
the sense that it is [aimed]{.mark} not only [at controlling a
population]{.mark} but producing [and reproducing]{.mark} all aspects of
[social life]{.mark}.3]{.underline} It is effective if it is an integral
vital function of individuals. The movement from defense to security
represents a shift from a reactive and conservative attitude to an
active and constructive one (Agamben 2002). The normative space of
imperial right is produced by a variety of bodies in the civil society,
including the news media and especially non-governmental organizations
(NGOs). Because these institutions are not run by governments, they are
easily presented as acting on the basis of moral or ethical imperatives
(ibid.:36). This dynamic is especially visible in the current "war on
terror", which popular legitimation centers on the concepts of identity
and universal moral values (Dalby 2005). It is made possible by
constructing military solutions as morally just (Flint and Falah 2004).
Al Quaeda's motives are identified as cultural and moral and so are the
"western" or US responses.4 As such bundling up of security, culture,
and moral values has moved to the centre stage of political legitimation
since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, we need to closely
investigate how the process works (Agamben 2002). Hardt and Negri
overemphasize the novelty of imperial subjectmaking. They downplay the
much longer processes of the construction of geographical and
geopolitical knowledge, in which the notion of universal values has
occupied a central position at least since the Age of Exploration (see
Agnew 1998; Mignolo 1995). They also under-estimate the spatiality of
power by conceptualizing imperial right as essentially a non-territorial
universalizing process that encompasses the whole globe regardless of
the current spatial configurations.5 [Their argument's utility for the
present analysis stems from its focus on a key mechanism by which
[hegemonic power works]{.mark} today: not against but [through]{.mark}
the [creative efforts]{.mark} of individuals. [NATO enlargement
exemplifies this]{.mark} mechanism. Whereas national security discourses
still invoke the negative notion of threat, however "soft" and however
indirect, [NATO enlargement discourse invokes only positive
categories]{.mark}---values, democracy, openness. [NATO]{.mark}, like
Empire, [is a "machine for universal integration. It does not]{.mark}
fortify its boundaries to [push others away, but rather pulls them
within]{.mark} [its]{.mark} pacific [order]{.mark}" (Hardt and Negri
2000:198). [NATO is central to the]{.mark} institutional [structure
through which military intervention is organized and legitimized
today]{.mark}, and it is continually bolstering its technical
capabilities to operate globally. [Its enlargement discourse]{.mark} is
moralistic, affective, and adamantly non-territorial, as it
[emphasizes]{.mark} not territories but [universal values. NATO
enlargement]{.mark} can therefore [illuminate]{.mark} in rich empirical
detail [how the production of imperial right]{.mark} and the
militarization of social life [work on a daily
basis]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Evidence suggests seismic shifts may be taking place in the political
as well as technological landscapes of the world today the likes of
which have not been witnessed since the 17th and 18th centuries.
Although it is foolish to try to predict the outcome of such changes,
democratic societies founded on universal suffrage, human rights, and
the rule of law definitely appear to be under threat (Levitsky & Ziblatt
2018; Rich 2017; MacLean 2017)]{.underline}. **[In the shadow of these
economic, political, and technological developments, the physical
environment is itself becoming less hospitable to biological life and
this trend looks likely to intensify as the present millenium
progresses. In the context of global climate change, it is gradually
becoming accepted that the very survival of humanity may actually be at
stake although most writers, scientists and activists understandably
choose to focus on the prospects of retrieving the situation before it
is too late (Flannery 2010; Gibson, Rose & Fincher 2015;]{.underline}**
Kaku 2018; Akhavan 2017; Oreskes & Conway 2014).xxxvii Current debates
concerning sapiens' relationships with the natural world are many,
however, and undercut many anthropocentric assumptions about the world
that have consistently been pedalled by humans to justify our actions
throughout history. What can definitely be agreed, at least for the
moment, is that planet Earth is the only home humans -- as well as every
other life form that we know -- have. It would be presumptuous to
suggest that all life on Earth will cease as a result of human impact,
but it is nevertheless reasonable to conclude that dramatic changes will
significantly alter the planet's capacity to maintain a sprawling human
population of more than seven billion people as well as sustain the
habitats of the vast majority of other living creatures. [In the context
of political and economic developments, the last century has seen the
central role of the Nation-State appear to have been both reworked and
eroded. For if at the end of the 19th century, the role of collectively
representing individual as well as collective human interests had been
assumed by the Nation-State, by the beginning of the 21st century, the
interlocked relationship between State and Nation have become
significantly weakened and the position of individuals and society as a
whole no longer appear to be the primary focus. This is evident in war
events and the rise of civilian targets as well as in the evolution of
general economic, tax, social welfare, labour and corporate
regulation]{.underline}. **[The instrumental power of the State now
appears to privilege the interests of global capital and the large
multinational corporations that articulate it rather than "the
people's".]{.underline}** In this emerging scenario, the needs and
necessities of "the people", as can be said also of the needs and
necessities of the biosphere in general, are subsumed to the interests
and logics of capital. This, however, is only the latest elaboration of
the underlying philosophy enshrining "star" fixated economic liberalism
(Das 2015:15) that Western culture has doggedly pursued throughout
modernity. At national level, the "rugged individualism" of liberalism
has realised enormous economic and technological development and
innovation but it has come at the expense of ever greater concentrations
of wealth and power, environmental and human exploitation. [As well as
entrenching systemic inequality, economic liberalism has maintain an
outward appearance of a broad commitment to the betterment and freedom
of humanity in general through the individual. Compounding this, the
regulatory systems established for globalisation allows corporations to
run up enormous debt in the pursuit of profit but then enables them to
shed such debt onto society when the things go sour. The shedding of
privately accumulated debt as collective responsibility during times of
recession has become an unavoidable consequence of capitalism's
boom/bust cycles and is usually justified by statements that the
consequences of allowing such large corporations to go bankrupt are
worse than the cost of bailing them out.]{.underline} With privately
oriented liberal economics adopted as social policy, communities bear
the risks while profits are disbursed to corporate stakeholders, or as
Veroufakis puts it, sharing the burden of venture capital at the same
time as enabling "public investments" to prop up or become a part of
ever growing corporate empires (Veroufakis 2017). **[The healthy profits
private interests accumulate then encourages further risktaking
'innovations' and so the cycle continues until such innovations overstep
the mark and stock exchange credibility disappears thus unleashing the
next crash]{.underline}**. Encouraging individual enterprise and greed
is, according to Adam Smith and other liberal thinkers, the most
efficient way to improve the economic well-being of the community. So
large and very large corporations have become the beneficiaries of
collective largesse as corporate welfare (though not general social
security) has become more prevalent. In practice this means that average
taxpayers help line the pockets of the already rich and powerful,
bringing into higher relief the fact that many multinational
corporations often pay no or negligible rates of tax on income. [The
global trend towards lower company tax contrasts with the rising tax
burden ordinary individuals are being asked to bear in terms of health,
education, and social welfare. This exacerbates the shift in tax regimes
from income to consumption taxes which obscures how those earning on
lower incomes end up paying higher proportions of their salaries on
indirect consumption taxes because taxes on goods and services are
charged at the same rate irrespective of how much one
earns.]{.underline} Add to that the generous allowances and subventions
National governments avail to corporations in contrast to the stringent
tax enforcement regimes individuals are subjected to, and the imbalance
between people and corporate' tax burdens is even more apparent. [Now
lets concede that rich corporations and wealthy individuals are best
positioned to take advantage of tax avoidance and minimisation
accounting practices (West 2019xxxviii) and even the most partial
commentator cannot avoid the honest conclusion that inequality is
embedded in global regulation that promotes the growing gap between
those who have and those who have not.]{.underline}

1.7 Technology and Hegemony The philosophers of technology agree that
[while rigid technological thinking hides the possibility of
citizenship, it encourages a vision of a totalizing state. This
technological state, or condition, defines a world in which autonomous
systematization no longer faces any friction or resistance. In this
version of the eternal present technological progress is allowed to
legislate for human affairs in addition to conditioning
them]{.underline}. As Feenberg writes: Technology is power in modern
societies, a greater power in many domains than the political system
itself. . . . if this is true, technology should be considered as a new
kind of legislation, not so very different from other public decisions .
. . [. The legislative authority of technology increases constantly as
it becomes more and more pervasive. But if technology is so powerful,
why don't we apply the same democratic standards to it we apply to other
political institutions? (1999, 131). Here Feenberg draws our attention
to the danger that the philosophers of technology see in uncriticized
hegemony. When citizens see politics as nothing more than a system of
power relations, it becomes normal to equate systematizing technology
and the political system.]{.underline} According to Feenberg, we [should
not think that technology's autonomy frees it from the need to exist
within society]{.underline}. As he puts it "\[[t\]he technical always
already incorporates the social in its structure"]{.underline} (1999,
210). Along with the other authors in the Heideggerian/Ellulian
tradition, [Feenberg is concerned with the damage that an unquestioning
belief in technological autonomy will cause to political
freedom]{.underline}. Verene explains the [danger of the autonomous
technological state in terms of myth. He claims that To redefine the
state through the logic of mythical thought is to eliminate the
possibility of moral judgment . . . . Politics becomes not a matter of
ideas put into action but the purveyance of images and rites that
relieve the self of individual responsibility and the state from any
acts of rational justification. . . . Myth is always present in the
background of social life, ready to appear as the manner of thought to
grip the individual and unite the individual with the collective in
times of political tension or crisis" (2016, 34). Verene explains that
the technological state as a vision of public life excludes deliberation
and political action. Even though, like Feenberg, he does not hold that
citizens are constrained to accept this myth, he believes that it can
exist as a substratum of civic consciousness. Verene is pointing to a
myth that claims that society can survive without citizens.]{.underline}
Simpson writes that [when citizens choose to believe this myth, the
technological state can actually become self-perpetuating and
self-directing: "technology itself decides upon the best means, and, to
the extent that we increasingly abdicate our power to make legitimate
choices]{.underline} . . . . it [becomes self-determinative without any
decisive human intervention]{.underline}" (1995, 21). For the
philosophers of technology, [citizens may choose to believe in the full
autonomy of the technological state because it seems to incarnate
systematic progress]{.underline}. [This attitude reflects a citizen
belief that self-making is a feature the non-human rather than the
human.]{.underline} Thinkers in the [Heidegerrian/Ellulian tradition
think that systematic and autonomous progress belong first to historical
humanity, and that the technological state is merely one possible
expression of this power of self-making.]{.underline} In Darby's
analysis of how technology combines both techne and logos he writes that
Techne pertains to [the universalizing and homogenizing of making
(poesis)]{.underline}. This re-presentation in the form of a thing (=
object = a being that stands before us) is demarcated by clear
boundaries (= completeness = wholeness). . . . Logos, in an archaic
form, is [a gathering together of experience that leads to perception,
or, we might say, to knowledge]{.underline} (2004). Techne is
homogenizing because the form in which a thing is made obscures our
perception of its composite elements. In this interpretation, forms
result from the human desire to have names for the parts of our
experience. There are "objects" of experience because we have made
objects that can be experienced as unities. For the philosophers of
technology, [technological progress reveals that the unity of experience
is imposed within the human being before it is imposed on the world.
Thus technological hegemony is really internal hegemony, because human
beings can break and make the boundaries of their own natures by
imposing unity on self-experience.]{.underline} When speaking about
Hobbes' technological attitude toward human nature, Darby writes that
all boundaries originate with, and are shaped by, the self-made being:
man. As the being who makes himself from an infinite array of
possibilities, man makes his own purposes and shapes his own ends. In
doing so, he becomes the spirit of modern science: technology (2016,
305). The modern belief in the power of information technology is
representative of the view that human beings are self-making.
Information technology is supposed to manipulate the disembodied data of
experience in such a way that it can become raw material for the
construction of a mind or person. In this context, to "in-form oneself"
means to choose both the categories and the content of one's own
experience, and to shape the previously formless data into a personal
identity. [Human beings must begin as a non-persons so that they are not
constrained by previous forms as they progressively bring themselves
into appearance. For the philosophers of technology, the totally
self-sufficient technological state presents an attractive but impartial
vision of the reality of self-making. The technological state appears
free to homogenize experience without the interference of social
authority]{.underline} (Juenger 1949, 79, 99). This apparent freedom
allows the modern citizen to believe in the possibility of progressive
self-making, but [the impersonal nature of the technological state
obscures the roots of its autonomy within human existence.]{.underline}
Technology can help lead us to adequate self-knowledge as the beings
that are always becoming, but the reality of mortality causes us to
retreat into the homogeneous present and away from our destinies in the
past and the future (Simpson 1995, 24, Heidegger, Question 1977, 32).
This is an ironic and anxious situation because there is no necessary
relationship between the technology of becoming and the advent of a
totally impersonal state. For Ellul, [impersonal technological hegemony
traps citizens into a kind of progress that is unfree and closed, rather
than free and open: The rapid changing of these social relations gives
an illusion of freedom. But it is not man who causes these changes. It
is they, stemming from the progression of the system, that determine
man, and it is their 'pressing' character that restrains his
liberty.]{.underline} He is constantly more and more defined by his
situation in the system (1980, 322[). The hegemonic claim that
technological progress will inevitably systematize human nature in a
particular way destroys the possibility of deliberating about the
reality or advisability of the technological state.]{.underline}
Feenberg writes that "\[I\]n the technical sphere, it is commonly said,
[legitimacy is a function of efficiency rather than of the will of the
people, or rather, efficiency is the will of the people"]{.underline}
(1999, 131). For the philosophers of technology, the identification of
politics and society with an impersonal system of causes and effects
legitimizes the suppression of the particular ends and particular means
of individual persons (Angus 1987, 111). Ellul puts the homogenizing
effects of the technological system on human nature in terms of anxiety.
He claims that [the technological state produces a type incapable of
reacting directly to . . . the forms of concrete things, incapable of
functioning without anxiety in any domain, and even incapable of feeling
alive unless authorized or commanded by a machine and with the aid of
the extra-organic apparatus furnished by the machine deity]{.underline}
(1980, 313-314). For the philosophers of technology, persons in the grip
of this kind of technological thinking believe that their very existence
depends on the technological state.11 [Every aspect of experience is
viewed as the product of impersonal mediation.]{.underline} Questioning
the nature of things or persons becomes an insupportably anxious
activity. What does this underlying anxiety tell the philosophers of
technology about human nature? Heidegger writes that technology
endangers our ability to see that the essence of nature is fundamentally
becoming. He thinks, however, that along with this danger comes the
possibility of human beings realizing that technology calls them to
cooperate with it and reveal themselves as the ones who determine the
direction of natural becoming: the coming to presence of technology
cannot be led into the change of its destining without the cooperation
of the coming to presence of man. . . . Man is indeed needed and used
for the restorative surmounting of the essence of technology. . . .
man's essence must first open itself to the essence of technology. This
opening is, in terms of that coming-to-pass which discloses, something
quite different from the event of man's affirming technology and its
means and promoting them (Heidegger, Turning 1977, 39). For Heidegger,
human beings can redirect technology away from the radical
systematization of experience, but they cannot destroy technology.
Technology and humanity are co-products of a world that is always
changing the way it reveals itself. Technology is the means by which
this change is expressed, and humanity is the means by which it is
understood. Heidegger thinks that true self-knowledge will result from a
successful integration of technology and human nature.12 This true
self-knowledge will come into existence through a 'turning' that applies
technological thinking to technology itself. Heidegger says that \[i\]n
the coming to presence of the danger there conceals itself, therefore,
the possibility of a turning in which the oblivion belonging to the
coming to presence of Being will so turn itself that, with this turning,
the truth of the coming to presence of Being will expressly turn
in---turn homeward---into whatever is (Heidegger, Turning 1977, 41).
Heidegger claims that Being has its home within human nature, or, that
humanity is where Being can be known as Being. In this passage Heidegger
shows that he is thinking of Being as an essentially empty category
since oblivion is what the 'turning' reveals. The rescue Heidegger
offers from the systematization of experience is another kind of
homogenization. Rather than technology operating as an active force of
historical progress toward stasis, technology is that by which humanity
examines itself and finds literally nothing (Heidegger, Turning 1977,
44). Heidegger's 'coming to presence' seems to come from and lead to a
place without any tangibly existing things other than technological
process. This ontological nowhere contains the possibility of creating a
world, but this possibility exists because Being needs a way to reveal
itself (Heidegger, Turning 1977, 43). In this interpretation of
technological becoming, however, human individuals do not appear to have
any ontological status as persons apart from their role as knowers of

#### In the era of contemporary geopolitics, war and peace have become indistinguishable. The 1AC is the rhetoric of the traveling preacher shouting extinction by escalation while ignoring the inherently paradoxical nature of conflict. Secrecy cannot be remedied by "information sharing" or "security cooperation" because secrecy is a precondition to justify war absent moral responsibility. The impact is a 'forever war' of negative peace characterized endless militarized warfare.

Secrecy, Escalation, and War **[Secrecy regularly plagues the conduct of
war (Carson 2018). Combatants and politicians have always attempted to
conceal their actions, often with a view to securing tactical victories.
Carson (2018) takes the argument in an innovative direction, however;
enemies cooperate "backstage" during war, not so much to gain an edge in
battle as to contain the destructive capacity of modern
wars]{.underline}**. The Cold War, for example, "started hot." Recently
declassified documents disclose the direct involvement of nearly 30,000
Soviet military personnel in the Korean War (Carson 2018, 2). This would
not have been a surprise to the public if most US intelligence services
had publicized this information (which they held); they deemed it best
not to publicize it, though.3 The question is: why? Carson (2018)
develops a more general version of this question about the character of
twentieth-century warfare---namely why covert operations were considered
preferable and, relatedly, why enemies would cooperate in secret. To
answer these questions, Carson (2018) claims that contemporary political
authorities (more or less) agree that open, acknowledged combat could
lead to unlimited war and, thus, to unlimited destruction. [Secrecy and
"non-acknowledgment" of "open secrets" therefore provide a means by
which to keep armed conflict private, not least to restrict the
potential for further escalation]{.underline} (Carson 2018, 44). To that
effect, Carson draws from theater to explore how overt and covert
playacting allows a suitable way to deny intervention. **[Put
differently, "non-acknowledgment allows a widely exposed covert
intervention to still remain an 'open secret'" (Carson 2018, 31),
thereby avoiding "domestic hawks" who may otherwise be in favor of
escalating the conflict. Carson (2018) subsequently applies this theory
to several twentieth-century conflicts, particularly great power
intervention in the Spanish Civil War, Korea, Vietnam, and
Afghanistan]{.underline}**. In doing so, he reveals how technological
developments have encouraged covert operations. From aerial bombardment
to submarines to drone warfare, great powers now hold numerous means by
which to guarantee secrecy and deniability. That, in turn, has led to
countermeasures. The invention of radar, for instance, meant states
could determine more accurately who had intervened and whether they
ought to disclose their involvement. As such, Carson (2018) offers us
much food for thought on the changing nature of armed conflict, many of
which now consist of covert, non-acknowledged intervention---or an
explicit reluctance to declare war. [The current international order,
predicated on the values of peace and IHL, has also opened the way for
secret wars]{.underline}. While Carson (2018) does not cover this topic
in detail, some passing insights explain how secrecy contradicts the
United Nations' (UN) core principles: "my theory suggests that such
institutions could undermine the ability of major powers to manipulate
information to control escalatory pressures and communicate their
interest in limited war" (Carson 2018, 310**[). Limited armed conflict,
in other words, depends less on how institutions regulate conflict than
on how actors deploy secrecy and non-acknowledgment to prevent
escalation]{.underline}**. **[This is a damning critique of the
international order, for it challenges mainstream liberal assumptions
(e.g., Bentham and Wilson) that conflict results from secrecy, and
therefore that public discussion and mediation provide the antidote
(Gittings 2012; Hathaway and Shapiro 2017). It also contradicts existing
realist hypotheses on the need for transparency to contain the use of
force (Van Evera 1999).]{.underline}** Carson (2018) might have expanded
on these myriad ramifications. Carson (2018) also does not fully
consider how secret wars unsettle the relationship between formal
wartimes and peacetimes, particularly when the former ends and the
latter begins. If actors supposedly do not acknowledge and barely (if at
all) admit to armed conflict, when and how does one determine "peace"?
Relatedly, when do societies augment or curtail executive powers? Many
competing audiences surround the political leaders to which Carson
refers; yet, these leaders gather enough legal and political leeway to
authorize covert military action in the absence of public discussion. It
remains to be seen whether leaders facing greater constraints when
deploying the military (including covert operations) would be capable of
overcoming public scrutiny. [All the same, the extent to which secrecy
challenges the principles of the global order (i.e., peace and
humanitarianism) says something about how international actors seek to
evade moral responsibility]{.underline}. Carson (2018, 94--97) alludes
briefly to this issue (i.e., that denial opens the way for the extensive
use of war euphemisms). Hoffman and Weiss (2017) and Fazal (2018)
develop that allusion in detail. Humanitarianism and War Hoffman and
Weiss (2017) thoroughly survey the origins of humanitarianism and its
relation to war and politics. [In so doing, the authors explore the
extent to which humanitarian norms have encroached upon---if not
constituted---the international order, from armed conflict to
adjudication to disaster relief. Compared to the humble,
nineteenth-century beginnings of humanitarianism, which sought to
abolish war or (at least) contain its effects, the tasks and aims of
humanitarianism have expanded considerably.]{.underline} As Hoffman and
Weiss (2017, 3) note, humanitarian principles "have not changed much,
but what has changed is greater calls within the humanitarian sector to
expand its work." Hoffman and Weiss (2017) first detail how the
destruction caused by war gradually led to the rise of humanitarianism
in the nineteenth century. They subsequently show how IHL---and
humanitarian action in particular---shifted in the aftermath of the Cold
War, becoming ever more linked to the provision of security. This new
breed of interventive humanitarianism, often labeled new
humanitarianism, spawned a whole array of debates about the nature of
peace, and the UN's role in providing it. That shift also instilled a
sense of urgency about addressing the weak nature of international
criminal adjudication, leading to the Rome Statute and, thus, to the
International Criminal Court. Finally, interventive humanitarianism
prompted discussions on the principle of Responsibility to Protect, the
legacy of which remains under intense debate (Bellamy 2008; Chandler
2010). All in all, the expansion of humanitarianism has affected war
significantly, including the practice of declaring war. Much of IHL
depends on the formal acknowledgment of armed conflict. Hence, for Fazal
(2018), the prominence and sheer number of regulations pertaining to IHL
have "created perverse incentives for states engaged in interstate war"
(Fazal 2018, 5). Any international lawyer will be aware of these
developments. More disconcerting, however, is how such regulations
became the grounds on which to evade political and moral responsibility.
State representatives were obliged to weigh the bureaucratic, strategic,
liability, and reputational disadvantages that accompany strict
adherence to IHL. **[Put differently, declaring war became too
burdensome from a moral, political, and military point of view. As a
result, leaders opted for secrecy or euphemism4]{.underline}**: Fazal
(2018) offers an especially pertinent illustration: the 1999 Kosovo War,
a conflict officially deemed less of a war than a "humanitarian
intervention" (Roberts 1999; Ignatieff 2000; Booth 2001; Wheeler 2002).
[Euphemisms aside, had the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
acknowledged that it was conducting a war in Kosovo, its pilots would
have needed to comply with IHL or be liable for violating IHL. To comply
would require flying at a much lower altitude than they did, conflicting
with NATO's strategic and tactical considerations (Fazal 2018,
153).]{.underline} Fazal (2018) also explains the more unintended
consequences. On the grounds that openly acknowledged wars are fairly
accurate "predictors of peace treaties," the decrease in formal
declarations of war also lowers the likelihood that actors sign such
treaties (Fazal 2018, 158). Paradoxically though, combatants in civil
wars, especially secessionists, tend to pay more attention to IHL.
Because many of these combatants (unlike de jure states) lack
international recognition, they have traditionally abided by IHL more
often, in order to obtain that recognition (Fazal 2018). Regardless of
whether responsibility lies with international law, IHL, or some
combination of the two, the current international norms place a heavy
legal and political burden on those who recognize wartime formally.
Those who use force openly, or who otherwise acknowledge armed combat,
consequently face major legal and political consequences. They may also
create too many duties. As a result, leaders eschew formal declarations;
Schadlow (2017) addresses how that loss of responsibility leads to less
unity during war efforts, thereby contributing to strategic confusion.
The Consequences of Euphemism and Secrecy: Operational Confusion
Schadlow (2017) argues that war is, and has always been, about
re-establishing order---that is, about reinstating a workable system of
governance. She therefore rejects the claim that the military ought to
engage only in combat. Military personnel and strategic planners (e.g.,
politicians) must consider not only the tactical considerations required
for a successful military operation, but also the political measures
necessary for obtaining peace. Most of the study focuses on
circumstances specific to North American politics; even so, this more
general relationship between politics, peace, and armed conflict likely
travels to other regions as well. Schadlow (2017) does not fully explore
how norms (e.g., IHL or international law) came to affect American
military thinking; nevertheless, she does account for how euphemistic
uses of the term "war" hinder the development of an effective long-term
strategy. Doing so, or narrowly focusing on the military "fighting"
dimension, leads to strategic confusion (e.g., reducing "wartime" to
combat). Unity of purpose and command then slips away, with many tasks
increasingly delegated to nonmilitary actors. In other words, the
reductive categorization of armed conflict, prompted by euphemism,
conflicts with Schadlow's (2017) general understanding of war---not
least because it compromises the war effort's chain of authority and,
thus, the unity of purpose on which that authority depends. In her
words, "given the centrality of politics to war, the United States must
realize that unity of command is essential to operational and strategic
success in war" (Schadlow 2017, 274). The war effort in Afghanistan
illustrates the point. It cannot simply be coined or reduced to
"counterterrorism," as the military also needed to pursue a lasting
peace there. That requires a comprehensive strategy and an
all-encompassing hierarchy of command with differing levels of
responsibility for distinct tasks---a comprehensive approach (to peace)
unattainable if one delegates tasks to distinct, nonunified authorities
(e.g., various nongovernmental organizations, or allies). Schadlow
(2017) consequently speaks disparagingly of the US military's decision
to assign noncombat operations to nongovernmental organizations in
Afghanistan and Iraq, without fully integrating them into its own
long-term strategy. Schadlow's (2017) discussion of the lack of
strategic planning and governance complements ongoing research about the
global obsession with neutralizing terrorists (Whitaker 2007; Noxolo and
Husymans 2009; Piazza and Walsh 2009; Fairweather 2015[). It also
reveals just how much political authorities, at least in the United
States, have neglected the development of feasible, long-term governance
models. That neglect results partly from domestic and international
pressures, as Carson (2018) implies, but also from the trend toward not
taking responsibility for a general (formal) war effort]{.underline}. As
the trend toward a division of labor in armed conflict tasks
accelerates, these tasks increasingly fall to a cacophony of
actors---sundry technocrats, soldiers, mercenaries, allies, and
international organizations---thereby diluting any one actor's
responsibility for the task and the overall unity of command. This
division of labor contributes, in other words, to the ability of leaders
to avoid responsibility for the activities formally contained together
within the broader wartime context. Other (Complementary) Explanations
George Orwell foretold the decrease in formal declarations of war and
peace as World War II ended (Orwell 1968). **[In 1946, not long after
the atomic explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Orwell presciently
claimed that international politics would witness the rise of
superstates that coexisted in a permanent state of fear. Powerful and
capable of mass destruction, these superstates would no longer fight one
another. That development alone would be positive; yet, the mutual
mistrust that accompanied superstates' rise would also generate
significant fear, thereby precluding the possibility of
peace.]{.underline}** "\[**[A\] permanent state of 'cold war'" would
develop]{.underline}** (Orwell 1968). Orwell's dystopian masterpiece,
1984, provides further insight into his argument. In a (not so
hypothetical) future, the wartime--peacetime distinction dissolved in
the face of euphemism, manipulation, and plausible deniability; the
so-called Ministry of Truth would face little compunction in claiming
that "war is peace" in its party slogan (Orwell 1977, 26). The books
reviewed in this essay clarify why wartime and peacetime have become
Orwellian in nature---that is, roughly equivalent to one another. **[As
legal constraints grew (Fazal 2018), politicians exercised greater
caution to avoid the moral and legal responsibility attached to
war.]{.underline}** They also moved wartime from a formal (i.e.,
declared) to an informal (i.e., undeclared, or covert) setting for a
similar reason (and to manage escalation; Carson 2018). As the
reluctance to formally declare war intensified, the need to define a
clear enemy and purpose for fighting weakened; that undermined strategic
thinking, threatening the efficacy of the military hierarchy and its
response to armed conflict (Schadlow 2017). To be fair, alternative
explanations for the evaporation of a wartime--peacetime distinction
exist as well. In one of the most prominent of these, technological
developments facilitate quick reprisals among powerful
states---reprisals short of mobilized warfare, but that also lack any
semblance of peace. Schelling (2008), for instance, acknowledges that
the capacity for mass destruction encouraged leaders to question the
relevance of a direct military confrontation (i.e., a battle between
forces) for their strategic policies. **[Warfare in the late twentieth
century, especially in nuclear era, consequently became more about
activities like concealed threats, diplomatic coercion, targeted
assassinations, covert operations, economic sanctions, and terrorism,
rather than military deployments.]{.underline}** The development of
drone warfare likely falls here too (Kennedy and Rengger 2012; Sauer and
Schörnig 2012 Boyle 2013; Chamayou 2015; Sandvik and Lohne 2015). Each
of these tools allows leaders an opportunity to respond rapidly and
coercively (to varying degrees) to adversaries without a declaration of
war---and therefore, an extensive military mobilization. That proves
particularly convenient for liberal, democratic governments, whose
politicians must circumvent public opinion while simultaneously showing
a strong determination to punish enemies (Sauer and Schörnig 2012).
Irrespective of contemporary developments, technology is a tool. It can
restrict or amplify the means at a decision-maker's disposal, but the
decision-maker ultimately creates and implements policy. **[Moreover,
current norms and ongoing global trends shape the policies that leaders
develop. A look at these trends suggests two other alternative accounts:
the growth of civil and police wars, respectively. That intrastate armed
conflict (i.e., civil war) has increased as interstate armed conflicts
(i.e., wars between states) have decreased offers one explanation for
this trend.]{.underline}** Intrastate conflicts frequently avoid a
formal declaration of war, since sitting governments do not wish to
legitimize those challenging it. Doing otherwise would not only grant
the challenger political recognition, but also admit it as an authority
to whom the laws of war (or IHL) apply (Armitage 2017). Governments
therefore go to great lengths to brand the challenges as anything but a
combatant (e.g., an outlaw, a criminal, or a terrorist). Although
promising, this explanation remains partial at best. The refusal to
declare war---including to recognize a substate challenger as a lawful
combatant---does not merely happen in the context discussed here. It
extends to the international sphere as well. Even NATO leaders (i.e.,
outside Yugoslavia) refused to declare war against the Yugoslav (or
Serbian) government in 1999. [Alternatively, then, perhaps the growth of
"police wars" accounts for the disappearance of formal war
declarations]{.underline} (Hardt and Negri 2004; Howard 2008; Jahn 2009;
Holmqvist 2014; Neocleous 2014). Tying war activities and policing
together exposes how ambiguity pervades the international liberal order.
Peacetime police deployments often assist with state-building
activities: extending sovereign authority within and patrolling the
state's territory, protecting the state from---if not punishing---those
who disavow the rules, and so on (Neocleous 2014). To that end,
integrating policing with war unsettles the distinctions between war and
peace, between the military and the police, and between combatant and
criminal. In effect, contemporary police wars mirror erstwhile colonial
wars, and rightfully so. Although European statesmen had few qualms
about formally declaring wars on their sovereign counterparts, they
seldom issued such declarations in wars against colonial territories
(Neocleous 2014; Bartelson 2018). **[Colonies, as "non-states," did not
receive the status of equal combatants; they were territorial holdings
for the parent state to patrol and control, with the parent state even
building the colony's administration in line with European practices. As
such, states maintained the international order with recourse to great
power patrol---a traditional police function---remedied through
state-building, and enforced by punishing those who reject its rules
(Kaldor 1999, 2003; Mueller 2000; Howard 2008; Holmqvist 2013, 2014;
Bartelson 2018]{.underline}**). These police wars partially unsettle the
basis on which the distinction between wartime and peacetime rests, for
they apply concepts and means traditionally associated with peacetime to
the armed conflict setting. Although the myriad wartime activities
relate to one another, a division of labor now undermines what once
constituted a united and comprehensive war effort (Schadlow 2017). It is
therefore unsurprising that academic observers question the UN's
practical distinctions, insofar as UN actions in some contexts resemble
war more than peacekeeping or peacebuilding (Fortna 2004; Peter 2015;
Hunt 2017; Karlsrud 2017, 2018). In this respect, the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA)
illustrates the point. It carries all the features of the modern police
wars. It tasks external military forces with neutralizing terrorists
(i.e., peace enforcement), deploys a robust international peacekeeping
force to patrol swathes of territory and to protect civilians (i.e.,
policing), and mobilizes UN specialists to advise and support Mali's
governing authority (i.e., state-building). As a result, MINUSMA
occupies neither the wartime nor peacetime space; it is instead a
sophisticated policing and state-building operation premised on a
division of labor: the military, the police, and political advisors.
This division of labor reflects and reinforces how the international
order has developed since 1945---especially the increased desire to
avoid political responsibility for war. Euphemism and the rise of new
terminology not only diffuse political and legal responsibility for war,
but also exemplify how the system has disassembled wartime into its
component parts. War increasingly ceased to be a comprehensive political
and military task, being instead divided into several specialized tasks.
Nevertheless, the range of creative terminology reflects not so much an
attempt to deploy euphemism as the fact that armed conflict can no
longer be reduced to war. But that raises a larger question: what is the
threshold that separates lower levels of combat from war?5 [In the
absence of such criteria, wartime is peacetime]{.underline}. Concluding
Remarks: Where to Go from Here? Further inquiry into the relationships
discussed here might continue along two major fronts. The first
addresses whether the diffusion of responsibility, and the rise of
police wars, reflects the demise of the international order or enhances
its robustness. With regard to the latter, for example, broad agreement
about the rules to armed conflict exists, even as economic quarrels
continue over which state benefits the most from the current order. The
UN's twelve peacekeeping operations across Africa, the Middle East, and
the Mediterranean are only possible in light of agreement among United
Nations Security Council (UNSC) members (ongoing as of December 2020).
This need not downplay the sundry disagreements among UNSC members, as
well as among the other rising powers across the globe; rather, it
reveals a measure of convergence in expectations---namely, the
acceptability of pursuing police wars, of punishing the order's enemies,
and of strengthening the state wherever it seems fragile. Hence,
although assessments of the liberal order's future most often rest on
economic considerations (e.g., welfare and progress), one can also
evaluate it according to the standard found in the UN's Charter: whether
the order has saved "future generations from the scourge of war." [From
that angle, the absence of formal war declarations---along with
widespread agreement on the need to punish, police, and build the state
across global armed conflicts]{.underline}---indicates that the UN is
largely fulfilling its role. The world may not be entirely peaceful, but
it is not embroiled in major warring either. It is something in between:
a policing world. Further research might inquire about whether this
policing consensus will be sufficient to overcome future disputes over
the distribution of power, wealth, and authority that will inevitably
challenge the international order. A second line of inquiry looks
elsewhere---to ascertain how the end of the wartime--peacetime
distinction, coupled with the division of labor that now addresses armed
conflicts worldwide, compromises the international order's longevity.
Neff (2005) aptly suggests that a legal order may sit on the brink of
transformation once the understanding of war and peace ceases to inform
practice. [After all, when politicians cease to invoke the traditional
wartime--peacetime distinction, or otherwise conceal it through
euphemism, then a fundamental question comes to the fore: who is
responsible for declaring war and peace? Managing international security
lies under the UNSC's purview, at least in the current order; yet,
quarrels over the legitimacy of great power intervention---as seen in
Kosovo (1999), Georgia (2008), Libya (2011), and Syria (2011)---make one
wonder whether reviving the wartime--peacetime distinction would be the
best means by which to deal with armed conflict]{.underline}. That
revival may not only lead to clearer lines of authority, but also
facilitate the attainment of peace. At least, this has been the position
of some who consider traditional wartime---as an all-encompassing
effort, involving combat and governance from the outset---to be more
effective than the present-day alternative (e.g., see Luttwak 1999;
Schadlow 2017). In the end, the international order's trajectory is an
old, if not foundational, question in international relations. The
tradition of formally recognizing wartime---and, therefore,
peacetime---provides yet another prism through which to investigate that
topic. Further inquiry might indeed question whether the international
order is moving toward the consolidation of the practice of global
policing, punishment, and state-building, which ultimately threaten to
dilute political and moral responsibility at the state level, or
alternatively, toward the reinvigoration of the state's role in
determining when wartime exists. These are all questions for and of our
time.

### L -- Ukraine

#### NATO intervention in Ukraine is not liberation, but new management -- the guise of democratic support is a myth used to obscure the expansion of Empire, but only a class uprising which denounces Russia and NATO alike has the capacity to free Ukraine

"Once Again on the Debates Regarding the War in Ukraine"
<https://www.leftvoice.org/once-again-on-the-debates-regarding-the-war-in-ukraine/>
31 March 2022) // ELog

[In this context, [we have]{.mark} not one but [two]{.mark} central
[problems]{.mark} that must be addressed from an independent political
position: the one posed by the [Russian invasion]{.mark} with respect to
the self-determination and independence of a semicolonial country such
as Ukraine; [and]{.mark} the one posed by [NATO]{.mark}'s
[interference]{.mark} as a continuation of its imperialist politics in
Ukraine and Eastern Europe as a whole, which so far has been put into
practice only through economic sanctions against Russia and the shipment
of weapons, without directly involving its military forces in the
war.]{.underline} The combination of both problems adds to the
complexity of the war in Ukraine. [For several decades now, especially
since the First Gulf War (1990--91), [we have seen wars of imperialist
aggression]{.mark} prevail under U.S. hegemony --- so much so that some
people (one of the most popular being Tony Negri2) mistook this for the
end of imperialism [and its replacement by an empire whose military
actions were directed by a global police power]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
the first war against Iraq, under the guise of "protecting" Kuwait from
an invasion, the United States enlisted the imperialist powers and many
other countries behind its military action, including Russia. This also
occurred with the coalition created to invade Afghanistan in 2001, which
was supported by Russia and resulted in its rapprochement with NATO. The
first cracks in the U.S.-led war bloc became evident in the Second Gulf
War of 2003, which both France and Germany opposed. Russia aligned
itself with their position, but made sure not to get in the way of the
U.S. offensive. These are three clear examples, though certainly not the
only ones, in which the struggle to defeat an imperialist attack and the
victory of the oppressed country were the basis of any independent and
anti-imperialist position. This meant supporting the military camp of
the Afghan and Iraqi people, while rejecting any sort of political
support for their reactionary governments. A similar analysis can be
made in the case of the Malvinas War. This was an adventurist
undertaking launched by the genocidal Argentine dictatorship to help
overcome its internal crisis. However, it pitted a semicolonial country
against the United Kingdom, an imperialist power supported by the United
States and other great powers --- despite the illusions that the United
States would defend Argentina held by Leopold Galtieri, the president
and leader of the military, and his henchmen. Argentina's defeat
reinforced the imperialist chains that bound the semicolonial country
and determined the character of the transition up to the 1983 elections
as the product of an agreement between the military junta and the
country's main political parties. It was also key to strengthening
Margaret Thatcher's position in her bid to defeat the British working
class and launch the neoliberal offensive on a global scale. [Trotsky
explained](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/09/liberation.htm)
this type of position in an interview with Mateo Fossa, using the
following example: In Brazil there now reigns a semifascist regime that
every revolutionary can only view with hatred. Let us assume, however,
that on the morrow England enters into a military conflict with Brazil.
I ask you on whose side of the conflict will the working class be? I
will answer for myself personally --- in this case I will be on the side
of "fascist" Brazil against "democratic" Great Britain. Why? Because in
the conflict between them it will not be a question of democracy or
fascism. If England should be victorious, she will put another fascist
in Rio de Janeiro and will place double chains on Brazil. If Brazil on
the contrary should be victorious, it will give a mighty impulse to the
national and democratic consciousness of the country and will lead to
the overthrow of the Vargas dictatorship. The defeat of England will at
the same time deliver a blow to British imperialism and will give an
impulse to the revolutionary movement of the British proletariat. [Since
then, [imperialism]{.mark}'s politics have become more sophisticated. It
[no longer exchanges one fascist for another, but pushes for "democratic
transitions" designed to protect imperialist interests]{.mark} by
reinforcing the chains of national oppression.]{.underline} I return to
this point below. During World War I, Lenin analyzed a very different
scenario than the one discussed by Trotsky in terms of the relationship
between an oppressed nation and an imperialist offensive, namely, the
case of Polish independence. In that instance, the country's
independence was opportunistically supported by the czarist regime after
Poland had been taken from it by Germany. [[[Lenin
asked](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/feb/29.htm),
"How can we]{.mark} help [liberate Poland from Germany]{.mark}!" Is it
not our duty to help in this?" [And]{.mark} he [answered]{.mark}, Of
course it is, but [not by supporting the imperialist war of]{.mark}
tsarist, or of bourgeois, or even of [bourgeois republican Russia, but
by supporting the revolutionary proletariat of Germany]{.mark} ... All
those who want to stand for the freedom of nations, for the right of
nations to self-determination, not hypocritically ... but sincerely,
must be opposed to the war because of the oppression of Poland ... Those
who do not wish to be social-chauvinists in deeds must support only
those elements in the Socialist Parties of all countries which are
frankly, directly and immediately working for the proletarian revolution
in their own countries.]{.underline} Lenin thus rejected the demagoguery
over Poland's independence expressed by czarism, which oppressed peoples
like the Ukrainians, the Finns, and so on. An undeniably staunch
defender of Polish self-determination, he was opposed to this slogan in
the hands of the czarist regime. And in response to the question of how
to help Poland liberate itself, he called for support for the German
revolutionaries, while in Russia he called for the independence of all
nations oppressed by czarism. It was undoubtedly a more complex question
than the mere determination of where to shoot. [Now, the conditions of
[the]{.mark} ongoing [war in Ukraine]{.mark} do not fully coincide with
those of either of these two "typical" cases and, in my opinion, to
attempt to reduce it to them would be a mistake. It [is not a war in
which all of imperialism is on one side]{.mark}, with the oppressed
nation on the other (as in the examples discussed above of the two Gulf
Wars, which have some differences between them, as well as Afghanistan
and the Malvinas War). On the one hand, [there is Putin's]{.mark}
reactionary [invasion]{.mark}, with Russia acting [as a kind of
"military imperialism]{.mark}" (although it does not qualify as an
imperialist country in the precise sense of the term, given the low
level of expansion of its monopolies and capital exports on a global
scale; it essentially exports gas, oil, and commodities, etc.). [On the
other hand, we have]{.mark} the semicolonial nation of [Ukraine]{.mark},
which is [being used as a proxy by the]{.mark} biggest [imperialist
powers of the West]{.mark} in their confrontation with
Russia.]{.underline} But it is also not an open interimperialist war, as
in the Polish case analyzed by Lenin. So far, Western powers have been
intervening essentially through economic sanctions and the supply of
weapons, trying to avoid becoming fully involved. The effort to portray
this confrontation as the product of an internal division of the
Ukrainian people themselves, a third of whom have strong linguistic and
cultural ties with Russia, is another aspect that must be added. Hence,
an independent political position, in my opinion, should also seek a
coherent combination of the elements discussed in the examples analyzed
by Trotsky and Lenin. [[To oppose the Russian invasion]{.mark} from such
a political position [means not only "denouncing" NATO, but]{.mark} also
[including it as an active factor]{.mark} in the conflict itself
[against]{.mark} the [self-determination of the Ukrainian
people]{.mark}. And in this respect, as in Lenin's analysis, it means
calling for [international mobilization]{.mark}, both in the "West" and
in Russia, [is crucial to supporting]{.mark} the struggle for
[Ukraine]{.mark}'s independence. The development of [an anti-war
movement that does not succumb to NATO]{.mark} militarism [is
essential]{.mark}.]{.underline} Having a consistent political position
regarding the national question in Ukraine also means supporting the
right to self-determination of Donetsk and Lugansk and of the
Russian-speaking population. At the same time, it means fighting against
the occupation of pro-Russian regions, whose population has the ability
to undermine all of Putin's demagoguery. [[No matter how many weapons
are circulating, only the unity of the Ukrainian working people]{.mark},
overcoming the divisions promoted by the oligarchies on both sides of
the rift, [can defeat Putin's invasion without trading one set of chains
for another]{.mark} and continuing the pendular trajectory (between
Russia and NATO) that has characterized the country's politics during
the past few decades.]{.underline} The Goals of an Independent Political
Position Of course, the degree to which an independent political
position is needed depends on the goals pursued by whoever establishes
that position. For example, the United Secretariat concludes its
declaration, "Only the international working class, fighting together
with all oppressed and exploited people, for peace and against
imperialism, capitalism and war, can create a better world." From this
point of view, its defense of the sanctions against Russia and the
shipment of weapons in general could be more or less contradictory
depending on what is meant by a "better world." From a socialist and
revolutionary internationalist perspective, things are clearly
different. And this is also important in terms of the debate on the
question of national self-determination and anti-imperialist struggle
with those who, like the UIT, the LIT, and the LIS,3 aspire to a
particular type of revolution called a "democratic revolution." In
relation to the perspective I have spelled out here, Mercedes Petit
writes: This approach \[of the PTS and the FT\] is directly defeatist
and, if applied, would simply and immediately favor Putin's invasion. It
is no coincidence that the FT-CI's declaration refers to the 2011--16
struggle against Assad. At that time, they also adopted a nefarious
position. As they themselves now point out, they claimed that there was
"a reactionary war with no progressive camps" in Syria and rejected any
military support for the massive mobilization and military struggle
against Assad. They were thus complicit, along with the majority of the
left worldwide, with dictator Assad and mass murderer Putin, by whom the
mobilization was brutally crushed. Although it cannot be likened to the
current war in Ukraine, there are some points of convergence with the
Syrian conflict, if we consider the entire process from the "orange
revolution" of 2004 to the Maidan uprising in 2014 and the subsequent
confrontations. The origins of the war in Syria date back to the 2011
revolt, which was an expression of the people's outrage against Bashar
al-Assad's Bonapartist regime and part of the Arab Spring. The
government resorted to fierce repression and incited an interreligious
confrontation. At first, the army was divided horizontally between
sectors of the troops and the officers. However, this would soon turn
into a vertical division in which the elements of self-defense of the
"citizenry" and the "people" (though not a class-based self-defense)
were relegated to a secondary position and regimented and subordinated
to the structure of the Free Syrian Army. This army was sponsored from
the outset by Turkey and later supported by U.S., British, and French
imperialism, although with some distrust due to its links with the
Muslim Brotherhood and Salafi movement. The conflict passed through
different phases, leading to a reactionary civil war. A progressive
element of this war was the development of the [struggle of the Kurdish
people](https://www.leftvoice.org/for-the-defense-of-rojava-against-the-turkish-invasion-imperialism-out-of-the-region/).
Their independence, however, subsequently became diluted in the context
of military alliances with the United States and later with Assad
against Turkish attacks. A significant part of the Left, inspired by the
theory of democratic revolution, viewed the Syrian civil war as a
revolutionary war, more or less overlooking the complexity of the
process, which included imperialist interference and inter-religious
divisions. In doing so, it adopted in its own way the positions of
Nahuel Moreno,4 [who
argued](https://www.marxists.org/archive/moreno/1986/r20c.pdf) that to
confront fascism and "counterrevolutionary regimes," it is necessary to
"make a revolution in the political regime: to destroy fascism to regain
the freedoms of bourgeois democracy, even if in the arena of the
political regimes of the bourgeoisie, the bourgeois state." In the same
way, they viewed the 2013--14 Maidan uprising as a "victorious
democratic revolution." In the [Izquierda Socialista's own
words](https://www.izquierdasocialista.org.ar/2020/index.php/82-periodico/el-socialista-n-263/620-ucrania-un-triunfo-revolucionario-de-las-masas)
at the time: "We are witnessing the triumph of a revolution similar to
the revolutionary uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East that led
to enormous revolutions overthrowing their oppressive governments. [[In
Ukraine]{.mark}, a [democratic revolution]{.mark} has also taken place,
resulting in the fall of the reactionary and pro-Russian Yanukovych."
Although the uprising took place against the backdrop of the hardships
faced by the Ukrainian people and their outrage against Yanukovych's
repressive and corrupt government, the IS [characterization]{.mark}
overlooked the actual development of the process itself. It [disregarded
the movement's]{.mark} program (with its [core demand that Ukraine join
the imperialist E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion[) and]{.mark} its
[leadership]{.mark}, consisting of a front [ranging from pro-Western
liberal]{.mark} opposition [parties to]{.mark} the extreme Right,
including [neo-Nazi groups]{.mark}. In line with their shared views,
[one of the first measures]{.mark} this front [enacted]{.mark} when it
came to power [was to repeal the law that protected non-Ukrainian
minority languages]{.mark}.]{.underline} Izquierda Socialista thus took
to the extreme the theory of "democratic revolution," [according to
which](https://www.marxists.org/archive/moreno/1984/Party%20Cadres%20School%20Argentina%201984.pdf)
"it isn't necessary for the working class and for a revolutionary
Marxist party with mass influence to direct the process of democratic
revolution to socialist revolution" given that, according to Moreno,
every revolution (resulting from the catastrophic state of capitalism)
is in itself "unconsciously socialist." It is difficult to develop
independent politics on the basis of such a theory. The fact is that
since Moreno's original formulation, inspired by the processes sparked
by the mass uprisings in the 1970s known as the "transitions to
democracy" (in Portugal, the Spanish State, and Greece, and then later
spreading to the semicolonial world), none of these processes of
so-called "regime revolutions" followed a trajectory like the one he
predicted. On the contrary, they resulted in reconfigurations that
allowed the bourgeoisie to regain its hegemony. [Thus, [under the
banners of an idyllic]{.mark} bourgeois [democracy,]{.mark} of the
supposed [defense of human rights and "freedom," the neoliberal
offensive spread across the globe]{.mark}.]{.underline} Today we see the
remnants of those politics in the decline of U.S. hegemony. Evidence of
this was the "orange revolution" in Ukraine and the course of the Maidan
uprising in 2014 that led to the rise of the pro-Western oligarch Piotr
Poroshenko. The outbreak of a reactionary civil war in Syria is another
example. What has become increasingly clear in these processes is the
profound connection between the realization of democratic demands and a
consistent anti-imperialist struggle. From his first formulations of the
theory of permanent revolution, Trotsky maintained that even in a
country where the proletariat was a minority, as in Russia, its hegemony
was a condition for the "[complete and genuine solution of their tasks
of achieving
democracy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1931/tpr/pr10.htm),"
which is necessarily linked to structural (and in many cases
anti-capitalist) transformations. The developments of the last decades
expanded the meaning of that thesis. [[Imperialist oppression increased
spectacularly during the neoliberal offensive, rendering
inconceivable]{.mark} any fundamental and lasting [democratic
conquests]{.mark} in semicolonies [without]{.mark} their [emancipation
from imperialism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Ukraine, amid the complexity
of the war, this is also an essential question. [[The interests of the
Ukrainian workers]{.mark} and poor [are diametrically opposed to those
of the]{.mark} different sectors of the [local oligarchy]{.mark} linked
to Putin and Western imperialism. [In the fight against the Russian
invasion, no true independence can be won under the influence of NATO,
which is why this fight is inseparable from]{.mark} the most resolute
[anti-imperialist struggle]{.mark}. [As Trotsky pointed out in his
time](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/04/ukraine.html),
[the prospect of Ukraine's independence is inextricably linked to the
fight for workers' power]{.mark}.]{.underline} This conclusion is
undeniably relevant today, in the difficult conditions created by the
Russian occupation, and is intertwined with the struggle for a socialist
Ukraine run by its working class. When we discuss the need to adopt an
independent political position, we do so from the perspective of these
objectives.

### ! -- Algorithmic Governance

#### The impact is an all-encompassing algorithmic schema that reduces human life to units of calculability. Everyday interactions in a social arena are transformed into covert warfare waged against people.

In August 2004, the US Department for Homeland Security (DHS) announced
the testing of a new tracking technology at five US land border ports of
entry. The trial---conducted by consultants Accenture and Deloitte in
collaboration with Philips Semiconductors---embedded radio frequency
identification (RFID) tags into paper I-94 customs and border protection
forms.4 The RFID tags contain a "passive" chip and antenna, capable of
transmitting a unique numeric identifier to a remote reader. By October
2006, though rejected for US passports, the same RFID technology became
a US entry requirement for visa waiver programme passports. Later the
same year, the UK's Transport for London announced that its RFID-enabled
Oyster travel payment card was to integrate with a Visa credit card,
allowing the tracking and tracing of all small transactions, actions and
movements on the London Underground system. How might we understand what
is at work here? A virtually invisible technology, concealed within a
paper document or "smart" card, is deployed with the precise purpose of
rendering a person visible, identifiable and locatable. [As architect
Dana Cuff has noted, "there is an irony here", it is "invisible,
miniaturized sensors that are making formerly inaccessible realms
visible" (2003:45). In part, of course, the apparent invisibility of the
techniques for making visible is assured because of their already
existing ubiquity in everyday commercial transactions]{.underline}. As
the Vice President of Philips Semiconductors had testified to the US
Congress Committee on Energy and Commerce in 2004, "consumers are
already likely to encounter RF-enabled personal identification devices
in their daily lives, such as secure access cards for building entry,
speedy gasoline purchasing such as the Exxon Speedpass, vehicle
anti-theft systems, and in transportation systems all over the world"
(US House of Representatives 2004:3). **[What is taking place, then, is
the redeployment of sensor technologies used in the commercial tracking
of mobile things, objects, animals and vehicles into the domain of the
tracking of mobile people. As a technology of location, tracking is
central to the processes and practices of militarization]{.underline}**.
As performance artist and social theorist Jordan Crandall has argued,
"militarization and movement intersect through the activity of tracking"
(2005:19). **[The domains of geopolitics and geoeconomics cross over
here (see Cowen and Smith, this issue) as the governing of the global
economy draws into common assemblage with a state that is concerned to
make visible the minutiae of daily life, to seek security in the
transactions, journeys and movements that are the norm and those that
are suspicious. Put simply, algorithmic war requires a target for its
calculations, preferably a moving target. The practice of tracking,
then, seeks to "detect, process and strategically codify a moving
phenomenon in a competitive theatre", whether this space is a
"battlefield, the social arena, or the marketplace]{.underline}**"
(Crandall 2006:4). In this sense, tracking technologies enable the
identification and location of moving targets. In the war on terror, the
specific form has become what Samuel Weber calls a "target of
opportunity", a competitive "seizing" of "targets that were not foreseen
or planned" (2005:4). [The targets of opportunity in the war on terror,
then, involve the depiction of mobile enemies: However different the war
on terror was going to be from traditional wars, with their relatively
well-defined enemies, it would still involve one of the basic mechanisms
of traditional hunting and combat, in however modified and modernized a
form: namely "targeting".]{.underline} The enemy would have to be
identified and localized, named and depicted, in order to be made into
an accessible target \... None of this was, per se, entirely new. What
was, however, was the mobility, indeterminate structure, and
unpredictability of the spatio-temporal medium in which such targets had
to be sited \... In theatres of conflict that had become highly mobile
and changeable, "targets" and "opportunity" were linked as never before
(Weber 2005:3--4, emphasis in original). Samuel Weber's key point of
discussion is the theatre of war, though his argument sheds significant
light on the algorithmic wars on terror that I depict here. [The
identification, localization, naming and depiction of mobile targets is,
in this war by other means, conducted in and through daily life, in
advance of any possible future strike or intervention]{.underline}. The
targeting of mobile bodies, things, objects or monies is becoming a
matter of locating---positioning in the sights, if you like---so that
the opportunities of a mobile global economy might be seized, while the
capability to take out the target remains. "Freedom is nothing but the
correlative of the deployment of apparatuses of security", states
Foucault, "the very possibility of movement, change of place, and
processes of circulation of both people and things" (2007 \[1977\]:49).
For this reason, the geography of algorithmic war is a spatiality of
locatability in movement, with origins in the interplay between military
logistics and the commercial logistics of tracking objects through a
supply chain. As consultants Accenture, Deloitte, IBM and
PricewaterhouseCoopers lead the drive for multiple networked public and
private applications of technologies of location such as RFID, the
commercial "targets of opportunity" that allowed the production of goods
to become dispersed and diffuse are clearing space for more diffuse
modes of sovereign power. The technologies that have made possible a
global supply chain of export processing zones and offshore sites are
simultaneously being embedded into border crossing cards, visas,
passports and immigrant ID cards that include mobile people within
governable space by means of their targeted exclusion. How has
locatability emerged as a key means of tracking mobile targets? The
emergence of knowledges of location, what Nigel Thrift has called "our
conventions of address", follows a tacit and often unacknowledged sense
that we somehow know "what will show up where and what will show up
next" (2004:176). In other words, a system of address has been central
to our ability to spatially and temporally locate events, objects,
people and so on. The history of addressability displays a significant
playing back and forth of military logistical knowledges and commercial
supply and transportation knowledges. Thus, for example, the origins of
1940s bar code technologies lie in the communication techniques of Morse
code. Historical records of early bar code techniques describe a
graduate student, Joseph Woodland, marking the dots and dashes of Morse
code into the sand on a beach as he thought through a research problem
of how to identify a product at a check-out. Extending the dots and
dashes to two-dimensional wide and narrow lines in the sand, Woodland
later successfully patented the first binary barcode system. As
computing technologies began to enable the electronic reading and
recognition of patterns, new relationships between the identifier
(postal code, ZIP, barcode, personal identifiers such as date of birth)
and the identified (people, places, parcels, vehicles) become possible.
Consider, for example, IBM's "punch cards" of the 1950s, patterns of
punched holes in a card to be fed into the pattern recognition
programmes of IBM machines.5 The "patterns of data on the IBM cards",
writes architect Reinhold Martin, "made visible what was invisible"
(2003:158). The machine's ability to "read" the cards extended beyond
the mere processing of data and into the almost magical realm of
animating a life unseen. In a 1955 publicity brochure, IBM reminded the
American public of how their lives were locatable in the traces of
actions and transactions left in the card and "read" by the machine: IBM
first came into your life when your birth was recorded on a punched
card. From then on many such cards have been compiled, giving a lifetime
of history of your important decisions and actions. If you went to
school, entered a hospital, bought a home, paid income tax, got married
or purchased an automobile, the chances are that permanent records were
made of these and other personal stories (cited in Martin 2003:159).
[What we begin to see with the intersection of systems of address with
systems of recognition, or the marrying of addressability and
readability, if you like, is a computer-enabled system of locatability.
While even rudimentary systems of address involve recognizing
identifying markings, whether these are numbers, features of the natural
landscape, or codes, the computer reading of markings and the
recognition of patterns makes possible novel forms of
location]{.underline}. Here, the emphasis is on a more mobile and agile
mode of address that does not "stop at the door" of delivery, but
instead dwells inside, making visible, readable and locatable the traces
of daily life. With the rise of what Jerry Kang and Dana Cuff call
"computer addressability", the fixed location of the address is loosened
via "unique identification codes" (2005:94). [Because the codes dwell
inside a body or object in the physical environment, they do, at least
in theory, make it locatable in movement. In this shift from
addressability to locatability, the ability to track and trace mobility
is achieved by animating the physical environment so that it is able to
"respond directly to what it sees]{.underline}" (Kang and Cuff 2005:94).
Thus, the "reader" of traces, markings or transactions, established via
the early technologies of punch cards and barcodes, becomes ever more
important to the system of location as "addresses move with human and
non-human actants" (Thrift 2004:183). Rather as IBM's early computers
inferred people's life histories from the patterns punched into the
cards, and from the intervals between them, contemporary readers of
location, as a group of researchers at Intel have put it: "infer
people's actions from their effect on the environment, especially on the
objects with which they interact" (Smith et al 2005:39). The embedding
of RFID tags into objects, as Smith and his colleagues have shown at
Intel, can be understood as one means to achieve a novel and mobile form
of targeting. The origins of contemporary RFID technology, perhaps
unsurprisingly, also find some roots in military communications and
logistics, with the earliest writings on the problem to be found in
research by radio engineers seeking more efficient readability of
signals (Stockman 1948). It should be clear, then, that we cannot say
that contemporary security applications of RFID are simply drawing on
commercial knowledges of location. The 1940s research was, in many ways,
the precedent for contemporary RFID technologies that deploy miniature
tags, emitting a radio signal with a unique numeric identifier that can
be received by a reader up to 25 ft away (Borriello 2005). Composed of a
silicon chip and coiled antenna, usually sandwiched inside a plastic
tag, so called "passive" RFIDs use the power supply from the reader to
send their signal and are, therefore, smaller and require closer
proximity to the reader than "active" tags that carry their own power
supply. For example, a passive RFID application such as a supermarket
loyalty card that is read at the till is, in effect, inert until it is
in range of the reader that activates it. Once in range of the reader,
the RFID's numeric identifier allows the reader to locate the tag and to
associate data on past readings of transactions. For a supermarket
shopper's "loyalty card" this might include patterns of past purchases,
coupons or vouchers for savings and such like. For a US--Mexico border
crossing card holder, the passive tag signals an identifier that can be
mapped across past patterns of travel, criminal convictions or terrorist
watch lists. In this way, the RFID identifies the target for algorithmic
calculation, at the border, at the supermarket checkout, at the entrance
to the sports stadium, in the subway ticket hall. "Through RFID tags",
as Jerry Kang and Dana Cuff have it, address is specified "to a fine
level of granularity, much finer than a zip code", so that we "will
likely authenticate our identity to multiple queries of 'who are you'
made by the enacted environment" (2005:106). What are the implications
of mobile forms of locatability for algorithmic war and, in particular,
for the exercise of sovereign power? As RFID stands on the brink of
replacing bar code and paper-based markers of location (I 94 forms,
passports, train tickets, paper money at toll booths, tickets for sports
events),6 how does the war on terror become enmeshed with the
geographies of everyday life? To be clear here, the seizing of targets
of opportunity by commercial players can in no sense be interpreted as
transcending the nation-state or outsourcing state security decisions to
the market. **[Rather, a logic of outsourcing and targeting that exceeds
any specific public or private domain---that is, as Samuel Weber
suggests, a "militarization of thinking"---works to sustain the "hyphen"
in the imagination of nation-state differently]{.underline}** (Sparke
2005:48). It does so, I will argue here, via a spatial and temporal
deferral of security decision that follows the dispersed geography of
the commercial supply chain. The state's ability to track and trace
people or objects in movement, across or beyond its borders, is
increasingly bound up with commercial techniques for tracking and
tracing objects through the supply chain. [The paradox of security and
mobility---the problematic of the moving target---is given the
appearance of being fixed by technologies of locatability.]{.underline}
As David Campbell writes, "were it possible to bring about the absence
of movement", that would represent "pure security", yet it would be at
that moment that "the state would wither away" (1992:12). The question
is not one of how to arrest mobility, then, but how to govern mobility
in such a way as to allow circulation and to sustain the impression of
securability. Put simply, to secure the sovereign power of the state in
a global economy of mobile things and people precisely by means of
targeting bodies in movement. The contemporary decentred state shares
much of its spatial character with the diffuse and dispersed capillaries
of global capital. If William Connolly (2005:148) is correct and
sovereignty is "migrating to a layered global assemblage", then one
aspect of this layering is the profusion of ambiguous locations of many
kinds, where the distinctions between legality and illegality, work and
violence, onshore and offshore are increasingly blurred. Just as the
dispersal of a global supply chain into offshore sites and export
processing zones permits the deferral of many kinds of commercial
decision---at least in terms of Jacques Derrida's sense of decision as
responsibility (1999:25)---so the diffusion of state authority into
ambiguous locations of many kinds appears to institute the deferral of
decision on behalf of the state. In the marketplace that is the test
laboratory for RFID applications, for example, the tagging at item level
by Wal-Mart, M&S and Gillette has allowed these commercial players to
seek efficient locations in distant places, and yet to sustain the
ability to control with precision (Eckfeldt 2005). The very idea of an
animated supply chain, making its own algorithmic calculations and
judgements---from "smart refrigerators" to smart supermarket shelving
and tracked shipments (Gunther and Spiekerman 2005)---incorporates ¨ the
bodies and objects of production and consumption, from the growers,
pickers and producers of raw materials, through manufacturing, supply
and retail workers. In the most vulnerable offshore spaces of the global
economy, where commercial firms seek only the most fleeting of finger
holds in a specific territorial space, we begin to see how the
commercial targeting of things and objects plays into and through the
targeting of people. Thailand's export processing zones---or "free
zones"---for example, have become "e-free-zones", using RFID to track
the movement of imported materials, deliveries, exported goods and,
significantly, the bodies of workers, as they traverse the boundaries of
the zone. The fortified security fences associated with export
processing zones, then, are augmented by equally carceral, but less
obviously visible, lines that track and trace the movements of workers
via "contactless" smart cards, and the mobility of objects via
RF-enabled smart labels. Similarly, the extension of RFID into border
crossing cards and immigration documents allows the feigned impression
of an open world, while it institutes new lines and boundaries. There is
a growing resonance, then, between apparently geo-economic systems of
locatability (of course always also political) that target the bodies of
workers and the movement of the objects with which they interact, and
the algorithmic security practices of the state: It plays out in new
systems of production that aim to narrow the intervals between
conception, manufacturing, distribution and consumption---shrinking the
delays between detecting an audience pattern and formatting a new
enticement that can address it. It plays out in pre-emptive policing and
warfare systems that aim to close the gap between sensing and shooting
(Crandall 2006:13). As Jordan Crandall depicts the geographies of
tracking and targeting, they play in and out of the plural spaces of our
world. As the commercial tracking technologies enter the sphere of
security---RFID passports, "smart" national ID cards, RF-enabled
immigration and visa documents, the tagging of detained asylum seekers,
employee "contactless" buildings access cards---they defer security
decisions into algorithmic calculation. The participation of RFID in
violent geographies is thus often obscured. When global consultants
Accenture made their successful bid for the USVISIT "Smart Borders"
contract, for example, they simulated the ability of RFID to target from
a distance: Using a nearby facility belonging to Raytheon, a
subcontractor on its team, the Accenture team constructed a mock border
point kiosk at which the government team had an RFID tag attached to
their passports. They also constructed a mock land border crossing where
a scanner read the RFID passport tags of the government officials inside
the car. Even though the car became momentarily airborne after hitting a
speed bump---the scanner read the digital information contained on the
RFID chips of all four government officials in the vehicle, displaying
their pictures on an electronic billboard as they passed by (Accenture
2005:242, emphasis added). [Accenture's business partner Raytheon, the
world's largest manufacturer of so-called "smart weapons", produces the
cluster bombs widely reported to be responsible for the violent deaths
of civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan. Here we see the targeting of
markets and neighbourhoods by military hardware segueing into the
targeting of people at border crossings and in the spaces of the
airport.]{.underline} Indeed, it is Raytheon that, in November 2007, was
awarded the £650 million UK e-borders contract as the leading contractor
of the Trusted Borders consortium, with Accenture the IT systems
subcontractor. **[Where RFID appears to render movement around the
subways, highways and superstores of the global economy as a smooth and
seamless experience, it does so by aligning the security practices of
the state with the mobilities of the consumer. In this sense, our
everyday geographies do spiral into and across the daily violences of
the algorithmic targeting of "others" and the visceral military violence
of bombing campaigns. It is important to recognise at this point that we
can only gain a limited understanding of the technologies of algorithmic
war by seeing them as explainable by the post-9/11 deepening of
political economies of surveillance (Lyon 2003).]{.underline}** The
capacity of RFID to make us locatable is actually acutely ambivalent: we
feel its potential to watch and to incarcerate just as we simultaneously
feel it fulfil some of our desires and pleasures. As Matt Sparke has
illustrated in his study of the biometric proximity cards used in the
US--Canadian border NEXUS programme, the appeal is made to "the fast
lane, where you want to be" (2006:167). Similarly, RFID is offered as a
means of expediting mobility in the UK's Heathrow airport "MiSense"
programme, promising to "simplify your journey through the airport while
maintaining security".7 The MiSense programme, by incorporating smart
sensors into the possession of the subject---"my sense"---invites an
almost playful encounter with RFID sensors. This stitching together of
playful leisurely RFID encounters with security practice asks the
subject to voluntarily offer themselves up to tracking technologies in
return for expedited movement. In some of the most playful forms of RFID
use in the leisure industry--- subcutaneous chips inserted into the arms
of customers at a Glasgow nightclub so that they may pay for their
drinks without the hindrance of cash or cards; RFID golf balls that
communicate their location to a remote reader---we can see security
dreams fulfilled. Night club patrons secure their pre-cleared identity
and financial details beneath their skin, and golfers seek out a means
of securely locating distant objects. Where RFID "pleasures and
anxieties cohabit", the targeted line of sight sorts and segregates
finite degrees of visibility so that, for some, "the edges are smoothed"
as they "blend seamlessly into the crowd" (Crandall 2006:12). For
others, of course, the line of sight targets for heightened exposure to
visibility---to stop and search, to continually verify identity, to have
movement in public space checked and intercepted.

Yet the point at which these two faces of power converge remains
strangely unclear in Foucault's work, so much so that it has even been
claimed that Foucault would have consistently refused to elaborate a
unitary theory of power. If Foucault contests the traditional approach
to the problem of power, which is exclusively based on juridical models
("What legitimates power?") or on institutional models ("What is the
State?"), and if he calls for a "liberation from the theoretical
privilege of sovereignty" in order to construct an analytic of power
that would, not take law as its model and code, then where, in the body
of power, is the zone of indistinction (or, at least, the point of
intersection) at which techniques of individualization and totalizing
procedures converge? And, more generally, is there a unitary center in
which the political "double bind" finds its raison d'être? That there is
a subjective aspect in the genesis of power was already implicit in the
concept of servitude volontaire in Etienne de La Boétie. But what is the
point at which the voluntary servitude of individuals comes into contact
with objective power? Can one be content, in such a delicate area, with
psychological explanations such as the suggestive notion of a
parallelism between external and internal neuroses? Confronted with
phenomena such as the power of the society of the spectacle that is
everywhere transforming the political realm today, is it legitimate or
even possible to hold subjective technologies and political techniques
apart? Although the existence of such a line of thinking seems to be
logically implicit in Foucault's work, it remains a blind spot to the
eye of the researcher, or rather something like a vanishing point that
the different perspectival lines of Foucault's inquiry (and, more
generally, of the entire Western reflection on power) converge toward
without reaching. [The present inquiry concerns precisely this hidden
point of intersection between the juridico- institutional and the
biopolitical models of power. What this work has had to record among its
likely conclusions is precisely that the two analyses cannot be
separated, and that the [inclusion of bare life in the political]{.mark}
realm [constitutes]{.mark} the original -- if concealed -- [nucleus of
sovereign power]{.mark}. It can even be said that the **[production of a
biopolitical body]{.mark}** is the original activity of sovereign power.
In this sense, biopolitics is at least as old as the sovereign
exception. Placing biological life at the center of its calculations,
the modern State therefore does nothing other than bring to light the
secret tie uniting power and bare life, thereby reaffirming the
bond]{.underline} (derived from a tenacious correspondence between the
modern and the archaic which one encounters in the most diverse spheres)
[berween modern power and the most immemorial of the arcana imperii. If
this is true, it will be necessary to reconsider the sense of the
Aristotelian definition of the polis as the opposition between life
(zēn) and good life (eu zēn). The opposition is, in fact, at the same
time [an implication of the first in the second, of **bare life** in
**politically qualified life**]{.mark}.]{.underline} What remains to be
interrogated in the Aristotelian definition is not merely -- as has been
assumed until now -- the sense, the modes, and the possible
articulations of the "good life" as the telos of the political. [[We
must]{.mark} instead ask [why Western politics]{.mark} first
[constitutes itself through]{.mark} an **[exclusion]{.mark}** (which is
simultaneously an inclusion) [**of bare life**. What is the relation
between politics and life, if life presents itself as what is included
by means of an exclusion?]{.mark} The **[structure of the
exception]{.mark}** delineated in the first part of this book appears
from this perspective to be consubstantial with Western
politics.]{.underline} In Foucault's statement according to which man
was, for Aristotle, a [**"living animal with the additional capacity for
political existence,"** it is therefore precisely the meaning of this
"additional capacity" that **must be understood as problematic**. The
peculiar phrase "born with regard to life, but existing essentially with
regard to the good life" can be read not only as an implication of being
born (ginomenē) in being (ousa) but also as an inclusive exclusion (an
exceptio) of zoē in the polis**, almost as if politics were the place in
which life had to transform itself into good life** and **in which what
had to be politicized were always already bare life**. In Western
politics, bare life has the peculiar privilege of being that whose
exclusion founds the city of men. It is not by chance, then, that a
passage of the Politics situates the proper place of the polis in the
transition from voice to language. The link between bare life and
politics is the **same** link that the metaphysical definition of man as
**"the living being who has language"**]{.underline} seeks in the
relation between phonē and logos: Among living beings, only man has
language. The voice is the sign of pain and pleasure, and this is why it
belongs to other living beings (since their nature has developed to the
point of having the sensations of pain and pleasure and of signifying
the two). But language is for manifesting the fitting and the unfitting
and the just and the unjust. To have the sensation of the good and the
bad and of the just and the unjust is what is proper to men as opposed
to other living beings, and the community of these things makes dwelling
and the city. (1253a, 10-18) The question "In what way does the living
being have language?" corresponds exactly to the question "In what way
does bare life dwell in the polis?" The living being has logos by taking
away and conserving its own voice in it, even as it dwells in the polis
by letting its own bare life be excluded, as an exception, within it.
[[Politics]{.mark} therefore [**appears as the truly fundamental
structure of Western metaphysics**]{.mark} insofar as it occupies the
threshold on which the relation between the living being and the logos
is realized. In the "politicization" of bare life -- the metaphysical
task par excellence -- [the humanity of living man is decided]{.mark}.
In assuming this task, **[modernity does nothing other than declare its
own faithfulness to the essential structure of the metaphysical
tradition.]{.mark}** The fundamental [categorial pair of Western
politics is not]{.mark} that of [**friend/enemy** but]{.mark} that of
**[bare life/political existence]{.mark}**, zoē/bios,
**[exclusion/inclusion]{.mark}**. There is politics because man is the
living being who, in language, separates and opposes himself to his own
bare life and, at the same time, maintains himself in relation to that
bare life in an inclusive exclusion.]{.underline} The protagonist of
this book is bare life, that is, the life of homo sacer (sacred man),
[who may be killed and yet not sacrificed, and whose essential function
in modern politics we intend to assert. An obscure figure of archaic
Roman law, in which [human life is included in the juridical
order]{.mark} \[ordinamento\]1 [solely in the form of its **exclusion
(that is, of its capacity to be killed),**]{.mark} has thus offered the
key by which not only the sacred tests of sovereignty but also the very
codes of political power will unveil their mysteries. At the same time,
however, this ancient meaning of the term sacer presents us with the
enigma of a figure of the sacred that, before or beyond the religious,
constitutes the first paradigm of the political realm of the West.
**[The Foucauldian thesis will then have to be]{.mark}** corrected or,
at least[, **completed,**]{.mark} in the sense that [what characterizes
modern politics is]{.mark} not so much the inclusion of zoē in the polis
-- which is, in itself, absolutely ancient -- nor simply the fact that
life as such becomes a principal object of the projections and
calculations of State power. Instead [the decisive fact]{.mark} is that,
[together with the process by which the exception everywhere becomes the
rule, the realm of bare life]{.mark} -- which is [originally situated at
the margins of]{.mark} the [political order]{.mark} -- gradually begins
to [coincide with the political realm,]{.mark} and exclusion and
inclusion, outside and inside, bios and zoē, right and fact, enter [into
a zone of irreducible indistinction.]{.mark} At once [excluding bare
life from and capturing it within the political order,]{.mark} the state
of exception actually constituted, in its very separateness, the hidden
foundation on which the entire political system rested. When its borders
begin to be blurred, the bare life that dwelt there frees itself in the
city and becomes both subject and object of the conflicts of the
political order, the one place for both the organization of State power
and emancipation from it. Everything happens as if, along with the
disciplinary process by which State power makes man as a living being
into its own specific object, another process is set in motion that in
large measure [corresponds to the birth of modern democracy]{.mark}, in
which man as a living [being]{.mark} presents himself no longer as an
object but [as the subject of political power]{.mark}. These processes
-- which in many ways oppose and (at least apparently) bitterly conflict
with each other -- nevertheless converge insofar as both concern the
bare life of the citizen, the new biopolitical body of humanity. If
anything characterizes modern democracy as opposed to classical
democracy, then, it is that modern [democracy]{.mark} presents itself
from the beginning as a vindication and liberation of zoē, and that it
is [constantly trying to transform its own bare **life into a way of
life**]{.mark} and to find, so to speak, the bios of zoē. Hence, too,
modern democracy's specific aporia: it wants to put the freedom and
happiness of men into play in the very place -- "bare life" -- that
marked their subjection. Behind the long, strife-ridden process that
leads to the recognition of rights and formal liberties stands once
again the body of the sacred man with his double sovereign, his life
that cannot be sacrificed yet may, nevertheless, be killed.]{.underline}
To become conscious of this aporia is not to belittle the conquests and
accomplishments of democracy. It is, r[ather, to try to understand once
and for all why [democracy, at the very moment]{.mark} in which it
seemed to have **[finally triumphed over its adversaries]{.mark}** and
reached its greatest height, [proved itself incapable of saving]{.mark}
zoē, to whose happiness it had dedicated all its efforts, from
unprecedented ruin. Modern democracy's decadence and gradual convergence
with totalitarian states in post-democratic spectacular societies (which
begins to become evident with Alexis de Tocqueville and finds its final
sanction in the analyses of Guy Debord) may well be rooted in this
aporia, which marks the beginning of modern democracy and forces it into
complicity with its most implacable enemy. Today politics knows no value
(and, consequently, no nonvalue) other than **[life]{.mark}**, and until
the contradictions that this fact implies are dissolved, Nazism and
fascism -- which transformed the decision on bare life into the supreme
political principle -- will remain stubbornly with us.]{.underline}
According to the testimony of Robert Antelme, in fact, what the camps
taught those who lived there was precisely that "calling into question
the quality of man provokes an almost biological assertion of belonging
to the human race" (L'espèce humaine, p. II).

As [feminist political theorists have long argued, from the Greeks
onward the political has operated through the inclusion by **exclusion
of the female**]{.underline}.lo Women are invisible in international
politics, too.11 [Crucial to both exclusions is the way the domestic is
excluded from the po- litical and/or the international.]{.underline}
There is disagreement on the im- plications. Jean Elshtain wants us to
[resist the extension of the po- litical to the domestic or family realm
since she regards that realm as emblematic of values more conducive to
the feminine.]{.underline} Cynthia Enloe argues that [we should regard
the personal as international.]{.underline} Indeed, Enloe stresses the
impossibility of making the distinction. However, both agree on [the
importance to Western sovereign order of the dichotomies of female and
male, the oikos and the polis, domestic politics and the international,
inside and outside.12 Like the feminists, Agamben argues that the
separation of zoe and bios is a practice of inclusion by exclusion that
is constitutive of sovereignty in the modern Western sense from the
beginning.]{.underline}l3 In other words, the [exclusion of zoe from the
polis is at the same time an inclusion.]{.underline} It is not just with
the rise of the modern state, as Michel Foucault would have us believe,
that zoe is included in state power. [Foucault argues that at the
beginning of the modern era, natural life comes to be included more and
more in the mechanisms and calculations of state power.]{.underline} At
this point, [politics becomes biopolitics,]{.underline} and whereas for
Aristotle man was a living an- imal with a capacity for political
existence, [modern man becomes "an animal whose politics calls his
existence as a living being into question."14]{.underline} Modernity for
Foucault is the point at which the species and the individual as a
simple living body become what is at stake in a society'spolitical
strategies. At one and the same time it becomes possible both to protect
life and to organize a holo- caust. However, according to Agamben this
picture needs to be corrected and Foucault's analysis of power in
modernity com- pleted. [Sovereign power in the West is constituted from
the start by the very inclusion by exclusion of natural life:
sovereignty is the originary structure in which law refers to life. More
than this inclusion by exclusion, sovereign power in the West is
constituted by its ability to suspend itself in a state of ex- ception,
or ban: "The originary relation of law to life is not appli- cation but
abandonment."15The paradox of sovereignty is that the sovereign is at
the same time inside and outside the sovereign order: the sovereign can
suspend the law. What defines the rule of law is the state of exception
when law is suspended. The very space in which juridical order can have
validity is created and de- fined through the sovereign exception.
However, the exception that defines the structure of sovereignty is more
complex than the inclusion of what is outside by means of an
interdiction]{.underline}.16 It is [not just a question of creating a
distinction between inside and out- side: it is the tracing of a
threshold between the two, a location where inside and outside enter
into a zone of indistinction. It is this state of exception, or the zone
of indistinction between inside and outside, that makes the modern
juridical order of the West possible]{.underline}. The camp is exemplary
as a location of a zone of indistinction. Although in general the camp
is set up precisely as part of a state of emergency or martial law,
under Nazi rule this becomes not so much a state of exception in the
sense of an external and provi- sional state of danger as a means of
establishing the Nazi state it- self. The camp is "the space opened up
when the state of excep- tion begins to become the rule."17 In the camp,
[the distinction between the rule of law and chaos disappears: decisions
about life and death are entirely arbitrary, and everything is possible.
A zone of indistinction appears between outside and inside, exception
and rule, licit and illicit.]{.underline} What happened in the twentieth
century in the West, and paradigmatically since the advent of the camp,
was that the space of the state of exception transgressed its bound-
aries and started to coincide with the normal order. The zone of
indistinction expanded from a space of exclusion within the nor- mal
order to take over that order entirely.

[Creating and [preserving]{.mark} a 'common world for all' is not so
much a call, as it is a chorus. The need to continually make [the
commons]{.mark} grow [exceeds]{.mark} the grossly [uneven distribution
of natural resources and wealth]{.mark} between the global elite and the
impoverished majority.1 Witness the scientific designation of our
current geological moment, the Anthropocene, a moment in Earth's history
so marked by the activity of one primate species that geologists have
proposed an entirely new unit of geological time, where [human
destructiveness will remain biologically and geologically evident
for]{.mark} tens of [millions of years]{.mark} on planet Earth (Lewis
and Maslin, 2015). [The Anthropocene's extinction rate is]{.mark} '100
to [1,000 times higher than normal]{.mark} background rates, and
probably constitutes the beginning of the sixth mass extinction in
Earth's history' (p.  172). In the last 40 years, [Earth has lost half
its wildlife diversity]{.mark} (Carrington, 2014).]{.underline} While we
use the term Anthropocene for the sake of its increasingly widespread
recognition, we want to highlight some of its limitations: 1. It renders
less visible the populations of humans who have lived for thousands of
years and maintained a more productive symbiotic relationship within
their material/ecological communities and 2. It disguises the central
role of patriarchy capitalism in the rapid (and recent) environmental
destruction that distinguishes the Anthropocene from other epochs (see
Moore, 2016). [However, we argue that educational [communities should be
fixed on]{.mark} the predicament of rapid [environmental
destruction]{.mark} within the more recent history of the Anthropocene,
[along with]{.mark} the widening [social inequality]{.mark} that is
[inseparable from it. Instead,]{.mark} current education [reforms
position schooling as an apparatus of social control and human capital
(re)production]{.mark}.]{.underline} Resistance to these reforms
involves preserving and producing a shared world in-common, for example
through the free sharing of intellectual labor, protesting the
inaccessibility of higher education (e.g. in Canada, Chile), high stakes
testing opt-outs in the United States, massive demonstrations and
strikes against neoliberal education reforms among teachers, youth, and
families (e.g. in Detroit, Chicago, Mexico City), eco-justice
educational movements that re-appropriate land for food access, and
indigenous education movements that center collective priorities and
communal politics (see Barronet and Ortega Brena, 2008). This chapter
argues for educational practices that (re)engage the commons (Means,
2013; Mueller, 2008). We outline a theoretical context for the natural
and social commons as pedagogical concepts, synthesizing the two in
Deleuze and Guattari's (1987) concept of assemblages in order to
highlight political possibilities of the commons for critical education.
In modernity, knowledge of the natural world has been shielded from
proper political reckoning, and the importance of protecting and
producing a shared commons obscured. As an ethico-political concept, we
can view the commons as the natural and social worlds, or wealth, to
which 'we' have shared, equal access. This definition is difficult to
apply today, nor does it reflect the relational ethic of many indigenous
communities in which humans are understood as part of, not separate
from, the natural world (e.g. the Lakota mitakuye oyasin, or 'all my
relations' and the Maori kaitiakanga or 'guardianship, protection' as in
of/for the natural world). Though we often view parks, conservation
areas, and nature reserves as common spaces, they are seldom accessible
to all humans, nor to the biota that are 'pushed out' to make way for
ornamental plants, animals, and other microscopic 'critters'. To afford
nature a 'political imagination', and politics the materiality it needs
for enactment, 'social' and 'natural' distinctions must be blurred,
while recognizing that traditional linguistic, scientific, and cultural
constraints will resist such blurrings. According to philosopher Bruno
Latour (2009) one reason for our current environmental mess and growing
social inequality is because Eurocentric notions of politics and nature
have historically been kept separate; the former confined to what
'should be' while the later 'what is'. This fundamental schism has
successfully functioned to keep politics out of the 'study' of nature,
and 'nature' out of the practice of politics, moral philosophy, and
ethics. From the onset of the Anthropocene, humans are themselves a
geologic force. In a provocative way, educators must recognize allusions
to 'nature', all that is non-human or non-artificial, as ideological.
The ideological character of nature as static other can be seen not only
by continued disregard for ecological realities, but also from the
'voice of warning' when scientific breakthroughs reposition our place
within an unquestioned conceptualization of 'nature'. Rejecting nature
as unquestionable backdrop to which we must always 'return', is
essential to asking big questions that link the 'social and the
natural'. For example, Slavoj Žižek (2011) stresses that considerations
of capital cannot be divorced from questions of nature and puts it this
way: 'how are we going to think the link between the social history of
Capital and the much larger geological changes of the conditions of life
on Earth'?2 One important lesson of structuralism is precisely that the
taken-for-granted should be refused. When Roland Barthes writes, 'the
"natural" is in short, the ultimate outrage' (Barthes, 1977, p. 85), we
should understand a fuller ontological meaning to natural---the outrage
comes not just from rendering the historical and political as natural,
but the 'natural as natural'! If humans are inseparable from nature,
then nature itself is always already ideological. [This [undoing of
the]{.mark} modern [culture--nature divide is]{.mark} a necessary [part
of]{.mark} what Hardt and Negri (2009) call altermodernity. That is,
[shedding]{.mark} the controlling aspects of modernity,
[colonialism]{.mark} and private property, [and grasping modernity's
creative]{.mark}, immanent [powers]{.mark} needed for creative labor and
new political and educational practices that promote a multiplicity of
differences and production of the commons (Hardt and Negri, 2000; Hardt
& Negri, 2013).]{.underline} Combining the natural and social commons
requires a creative refocus on virtual/actual ontological frameworks
that allow their interplay. As Vine Deloria and Daniel Wildcat (2001)
point out, Indigenous thought and practices have long fused the
'natural' and the political and promoted communal living between humans
and non-humans. Modern ecology and indigenous models of politics and
ethics have much in common: they are both about complex relationships
between living organisms and their environments. Indigenous thought has,
in my mind, one key advantage: it sees the ecosystem as the appropriate
site for the study of politics and ethics. (Deloria and Wildcat, 2001,
p. 139) If the commons serve as the grounds for education for
emancipation, how do we envision its immanent potential in classrooms
and movements for social and ecological justice? We argue here that
assemblage theory, in short, the fusing of material and discursive parts
in social analyses, adds a much needed ontological dimension to
education research and critical pedagogy. [Clayton Pierce (2015)
cautions that the neoliberal restructuring of schools does not allow
teachers and students to take the view that both humans and non-humans
have agency, precisely because [agency is geared toward]{.mark} (bio)
[capitalist ends]{.mark} through entrepreneurship and
commodification.]{.underline} The prefix 'bio' describes our current
political reality where forms of life, including educational life, have
become the focus of modern governance and control. Pierce stresses the
double meaning of 'bio' in biocapitalism. [In one sense, [a new form
of]{.mark} modern [governance]{.mark}, and capitalism, that [reaches
into every corner of]{.mark} human [social life to reproduce]{.mark} the
[subjectivities]{.mark} and modes of living [needed to reproduce the
social order]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, 'bio' also means the
harnessing of all powers of life---literally the commodification or
mobilization of DNA, cells, genes, etc. for the purposes of capital.
[[Education must]{.mark} not only produce and nurture a world-in-common,
but also [challenge]{.mark} the enclosure of the commons---that is,
[exploitation of what is common]{.mark} (forests, groundwater, and
ideas) [for]{.mark} private interests and the [production of capital.
Neoliberal, global capitalist enclosure of the commons is]{.mark}
perhaps [the key political battle]{.mark} for education [for the
twentyfirst century]{.mark} (see Means, 2014; Slater,
2014).]{.underline} Hendersen and Hursh (2014) outline the biopolitical
nature of our current moment---resistance to neoliberal reforms will
come from below through production of the commons. Part 1: The Commons
as an Emancipatory Pedagogical Concept [As stated above,
[privatization]{.mark} (or enclosure) [of the commons]{.mark} is
dangerous because it [values]{.mark} biotic and abiotic [entities as
private commodities]{.mark} for certain individuals, not communities or
the commons.]{.underline} The private commodification of water in
California by Nestle™ is a good example of profit accumulation
destroying the commons. Yet, resistance to privatization is growing.
Urban populations are consistently creating the commons through shared
struggles of collective existence, and the creation of 'ecological
space' (Hardt and Negri, 2004). Indigenous peoples' ecologically and
community-oriented sense of place is highly threatening to the goals of
capital because indigenous ways of being often do not rely on products
from global capitalist commodity chains (Peña, 2014; Wildcat, 2009).
[However, [the struggle to]{.mark} produce and [preserve the commons is
not just about commodities, but the (re)production of
subjectivities]{.mark} needed to produce the commons (Hardt and Negri,
2009).]{.underline} Graham Slater (2014) encourages educators to move
beyond an exclusively anthropocentric notion of the commons as shared
human language, communication, and by extension, culture. Although this
is an invaluable aspect of the common, it is limited insofar as it
asserts the primacy of verbal communication in social production and
centers an anthropocentric vision of communicative relationships in
which meaningful and responsive relationships with nonhuman animals and
environments are subordinated to intraspecies dialogue ... This
shortcoming is not a fatal flaw in Hardt and Negri's conceptualization
of the common, rather, it indicates the need to embrace this antagonism
as the grounds for elaborating a more fully ecological theorization of
the common. (p. 547) Slater emphasizes an antagonistic version of the
commons, for example one that does not let settler colonists feel
comfortable with a social commons that forgets destructive colonial
realities. Indeed, the commons has a history---a social, colonial,
ecological, geological, mythological, philosophical, and theological
past. While there is some recognition that we share ecological habitats,
with the rise of immaterial labor and its cultural, cognitive, artistic,
intellectual and affective products that can be shared in common, our
current notion of the commons needs to expand. The (bio)political
potential of immaterial labor is that the ideas, signs, and affects
required for (bio)capitalist growth, rely on interconnectivity and free
sharing---paradoxically, what global (bio) capitalism needs to grow is
anti-thetical to the rule of private property. A recent article in The
Guardian on the 'end of capitalism' articulates this well: By building
business models and share valuations based on the capture privatisation
of all socially produced information, such firms are constructing a
fragile corporate edifice at odds with the most basic need of humanity,
which is to use ideas freely. (Mason, 2015) The old 'logic of scarcity'
rule that is widely seen to drive economies and resource development
also needs to be rethought. [The [logic of scarcity sees 'natural
resources' as something to be consumed. ]{.mark}]{.underline}However,
according to Hardt and Negri (2009), a key aspect of the commons is that
it puts the bios to work for the commons, involving not a logic of
consumption but of growth. Resources of the commons, such as free
education, are continually renewable. If we read a text, offer an
interpretation, discern a new truth in science, this by no means limits
anyone else in doing the same. On the contrary, interpretations and new
science proliferate when people are encouraged to build off the exchange
of ideas, affects and interpretations. This on its own should be a
justification for offering free K--12 and higher education! [[The
logic]{.mark} of consumption [distorts our view of the
commons]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, we are not running out of
fossil fuels, in fact, there are too many deposits, and they should be
left in the ground. Education should promote a fundamental shift in the
logic of production from utter consumption of the commons to the
proliferation of the commons (p. 300). In Canada, Latin America, and New
Zealand indigenous curricula and pedagogies that promote
non-exploitative relationships and communal living are gaining ground
thanks to community and indigenous activism. In Chiapas, Mexico, the
Zapatista movement led to the establishment of autonomous education for
indigenous Tzetsal youth in which children learn, alongside literacy and
numeracy, skills for political resistance, collective democratic
engagement, caring for land, gender equality and the revolutionary role
of women, etc. (Barronet and Ortega Brena, 2008). In Canada, aboriginal
communities have engaged in democratic politics through dissensus in the
name of equality (Rancière and Corcoran, 2010; Bazzul, 2015). Indigenous
political actions break down artificial dichotomies between natural and
social commons. The Idle No More movement advocates a view of rivers,
lakes, and non-humans, as part of the same commons and deserving of
equal consideration---something unthinkable to a modern juridical
mindset. Such activist movements are alter-futures (much like Hardt and
Negri's concept of altermodernity), a combination of democratic thinking
and communal forms of life. Idle No More employed social media to
(re)produce commons resources, understandings, and labor needed to fight
for just futures. [Educators whose aim is to produce [a]{.mark} common
[livable world must challenge colonial discourses and ontologies, where
land is viewed only as a 'natural resource']{.mark} for human
consumption rather than that which we are ecologically embedded within
and part of (Barad, 2007; Watts, 2013).]{.underline} As we shall see in
the next section assemblage thinking can help educators and students
envision something new. Education for the commons recognizes that the
long-term project is one of (re)production, something continually
(re)made: The common is thus in a paradoxical position as being a ground
or a presupposition that is also the result of the process. Our
analysis, then, from this point on in our research should be aimed not
at 'being common' but 'making the common.' (Hardt and Negri, p. 123)
Emancipatory education and social struggles have their basis in the
common, not simply as a 'resource', but 'an inexhaustible source of
innovation and creativity' (Hardt and Negri, 2009, pp.  111--112). The
commons consists of a multitude of singularities, subjectivities formed
along the lines of sex/gender, race, culture, class, spirituality and
beyond.3 Engagement with the commons is therefore an engagement with
alterity, as the commons sets the stage for interactions with
singularities and becoming. Encountering alterity begins a critique of
what we have taken for granted as other or self, as well as processes of
becoming autonomous that arise from the production of a shared commons
(Hardt and Negri, 2009, p. 122; Slater and Griggs, 2015). [A pedagogy of
the commons employs (bio)political reason to intervene in the
[controlling forces of biopower]{.mark} that [employ education as a way
to maintain a]{.mark} [White/Eurocentric/global capitalist/neocolonial
vision of the world]{.mark} (Bazzul, 2014; Tolbert and Schindel Dimick,
in press).]{.underline} Engaging biopolitically means (re)working forces
of biopower from below toward different forms of eco-social
relations---life in the service of the commons (Hardt and Negri, 2009,
p. 125). Whereas the traditional notion poses the common as a natural
world outside of society, the biopolitical conception of the common
permeates equally all spheres of life .... We might call this an
'ecology of the common---an ecology focused equally on nature and
society, on humans and the non-human world in a dynamic of
interdependence, care, and mutual transformation.' (Hardt and Negri,
2009, p. 171) [The struggle over [subjectivity is integral to the
commons]{.mark}, and therefore biopolitical in that forms of life
(subjectivities) come together in cooperation to (re)produce the
commons.]{.underline} The Metropolis is an extremely important site for
(bio)political struggle and producing the commons today, as cities are
ideal locations for interactions of the multitude and immaterial labor.
Facing down neoliberal restructuring of public schooling through
coalitions of teachers, students, and parents is also a form of building
the commons. Such coalitions create spaces where common interests,
knowledges, relationships, and forms of life grow. At the same time the
commons are a creative entity always in danger of enclosure---sometimes
for purported social or ecological good. Figure 4.1 diagrams some
enclosures of the commons through the privatization of life (e.g.
genetic, educational). Biopolitical struggle is inherent to all fields
of education including science education, where the (re)production of
biotechnological labor is often in conflict with science for the common
good (Bazzul, 2012; Bencze and Carter, 2011; Pierce, 2013). If
scientific knowledge is produced in-common and belongs to all, why
should it be appropriated, enclosed by companies such as Novartis™ and
Monsanto™, and not just along global capital lines, but along those of
nationality, gender, and race (Shiva, 2000). Developing education for
the commons, may involve developing more qualitative indicators of both
growth (and corruption) of the commons, since it exceeds the use of
metrics (Hardt and Negri, 2004). [Education for [the commons must move
away from]{.mark} reproducing what Hardt and Negri (2009, p. 159)
identify as [corrupt forms]{.mark} of the common---systems of
organization geared to the needs of certain individuals and not what is
common to all. Some examples of this corruption are [nepotistic
practices, the]{.mark} chauvinist ([nationalist)]{.mark} nation state
and its blind [adherence to mythic natural origins, the rule of private
property, ethnocentrisms, racisms, heteronormativity, and the
corporation---a parasite of the commons for the accumulation of]{.mark}
(bio)[capital]{.mark}.]{.underline} The following educational goals are
relevant for fostering the biopolitical production of the commons:
\[figure omitted for formatting\] Maximizing Free Accessibility of
Knowledge---Education must facilitate access to knowledge and give all
students the competencies and tools to access this knowledge. •
Flattening Hierarchies---Education for the commons involves tearing down
structural and pedagogical hierarchies (see Freire, 1972; hooks, 1994;
Hardt, 2011). • Preservation of the 'Natural' Commons---Education must
employ rationalities toward the service of life, ecology and relations
between humans and non-humans. • Trouble the 'Expert'---Educational
communities must de-privilege the voices of experts who tell us we have
no alternative (like the 'TINA' rhetoric of neoliberalism). •
Inclusiveness---Radical inclusion should engage subjectivities at the
precarious edges of politics as they have the greatest knowledge of, and
ability to challenge, practices of biopower.

### ! -- Democracy

#### Venezuela is a nation that resists US hegemony and imperialist ideas, and so the US decides to try and invoke a coup and neutralize an enemy to the US, dictating that the US does not care about democracy, it cares about its agenda

political leadership in challenging US\'s imperialist foreign
policy.]{.underline}** Venezuela does not have military bases in other
parts of Latin America nor has it invaded, occupied or sponsored
military coups in other Latin American countries like Obama and his
predecessors. Venezuela condemned the US invasion of Haiti, the
US-supported military coups in Honduras (2009), Venezuela (2002, 2014,
2015), Bolivia (2008) and Ecuador (2010). Evidently, **[Obama\'s
\"emergency\' decree and sanctions against Venezuela were directed at
maintaining unchallenged US imperial supremacy in Latin America and
degrading Venezuela\'s independent, democratic foreign
policy.]{.underline}** So, to understand Obama\'s policy toward
Venezuela we have to analyze why he chose overt, unilateral bellicose
threats at this time.

### ! -- Hegemony

#### As the US became the only global superpower at the turn of the 1990's it began enforcing ITS global agenda and rule upon every global nation, dominating institutions in civil society, while isolating those that disagree, meaning that a large part of global affairs are controlled by the US

customs that were first implemented by Western European states, this
step giving the impression of unanimous global will.]{.underline}**
Thus: Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia,

follow and from here the whole planet. **[In this way, the US dollar,

adopted by the USA to the states it considered \"bad\" were followed by

here, makes the US no longer be placed as a pinnacle on the pyramid and
will rather a peak in unstable and centrifugal circles trying to carve
its own geopolitical path.

### ! -- Middle East Hegemony

#### Due to the Unites State's imperialist agenda, it allied and now supports Israel as a tool to help control the Middle East, has created a Zionist nation intertwined in US society, which by trying to feed this groing regional hegemon, destroyed countless markets in the name of "Imperialism" 

#### Petras 20 James Petras is a retired Bartle Professor (Emeritus) of Sociology at Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York and adjunct professor at Saint Mary\'s University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada who has published on political issues with particular focus on Latin America and the Middle East, imperialism, globalization, and leftist social movements *[US Imperialism: The Changing Dynamics of Global Power]{.underline}* 

**[US empire builder have constructed three regional axes of power in
the Middle East.]{.underline}** In order of importance, they are: the
US-Israel axis of power the US-Saudi axis and the US-Turkey axis of
power**[. The US-Israel axis of power is based on a longstanding
agreement. The US militarily and financially supports Israel\'s colonial
expansion into Palestine and Syria, while Israel backs US projections of
military and political power throughout the region. Thanks to US
military and financial aid, Israel has become the dominant military
power in the Middle East and the only nuclear power in the region. The
US has used Israel\'s wars and invasions of its neighbors to secure
several Arab collaborator client states (notably Jordan and
Egypt).]{.underline}** More recently the US-Israeli power axis has been
expanded to include the client regime in Kurdistan (northen Iraq). In
addition, the US-Israeli axis has been deeply involved in financing and
promoting collaborators\' opposition forces in Lebanon (currently the
Hariri political formation), sectors of the armed mercenaries in Syria,
Kurdish Peshmerga militias in Iraq and the so- called \'Mujahedeen al
Khalq\' terrorists in Iran**[. The US CIA and Israel\'s Mossad engage in
clandestine violent operations, directly intervening to destabilize
secular and Islamic nationalist regimes like Iran by for example,
disrupting their communications and assassinating their scientists and
leaders.]{.underline}** Israel has secured political and intelligence
agreements with Egypt and Jordan to isolate and dispossess the
Palestinians. The US has secured military bases and operational
platforms in Egypt and Jordan to attack Hezbollah in Lebanon, President
Bashar al Assad in Syria and the Iranian government. However, while in
the past each country benefited from the US-Israel axis of power,
recently it has turned into a costly, asymmetrical relation, a zero-sum
game, where Israel\'s regional power increases as the US empire
deteriorates. This turn of events is costly understood if one Middle
East policy is formulated in the examines the way in which US. **[Over
the past three decades Israel has constructed the most formidable
organized power configuration in loyalties and blind obedience, over a
half-million Jewish Zionists have embraced Israel's interests and
pursued them with a zeal and single-mindedness that is unmatched by any
other foreign-based lobby. Prominent Zionists have permeated key state
institutions, from the US Treasury, Department of Commerce and Pentagon
to the White House and National Security Council. They dominate the US
Congress and the Twi-party system, especially the nomination and
electoral process, ensuring that only candidates who sweat allegiance to
Israel are allowed to run and be elected. That way no political debate
regarding Israel's subversive influence is permitted. They dominate the
mass media, ensuring that all news and commentary is favorable to Israel
and all criticism of the Jewish State is excluded]{.underline}**. Here
we have the paradox of an imperial ally: Israel colonizing an imperial
power and exacting tribute, with foreign aid to Tel Aviv exceeding 3.6\$
billion. More Importantly, the Zionist Power configuration plays a key
role in waging wars against Israel's designated enemies and providing
diplomatic cover for the Jewish state's ethnic slaughter of the people
of Palestine. The Israel-US Alliance has been set up wholly on Israel's
terms. Even **[as Israel rains thousands of tons of bombs on the captive
people of Gaza, to the horror of the world public opinion, the White
House applauds and the US Congress unanimously approves resolutions
supporting Israel's war crimes at the behest of the powerful Zionists
ensconced in Washington]{.underline}**. **[Whatever the US empire has
gained from Israel in the way of intimidating and humiliating Arab
leaders it has lsot economic terms. Major oil companies have lost
hundreds of billions of dollars in trade and investment from the wars in
Iraq, Syria and Libya and from sanctions against Iran. The US domestic
economy has lost hundreds of billions of dollars in income and
investment as a result of the high cost of oil imports resulting from
the wars]{.underline}**. Strategically, the asymmetrical US-Israeli
alliance has turned the US into an empire dominated by militarists, and
one exclusively focused on the Middle East. This transformation into a
military-driven empire has resulted in neglect, decline and displacement
of the imperial influence in the most dynamic growth sectors of the
world economy: Asia, Latin America and Russia. It is a paradox that the
lopsided strength of the US-Israeli axis in the Middle East has
profoundly undermined the US global economic and domestic foundations of
empire**[. Moreover, the brutal colonial-style wars in the Middle East
promoted by US Zionist strategists in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan have
destroyed any possibility of reconstructing viable client states and
markets out of these conquered nations]{.underline}**. Israeli military
strategists have long wanted these regimes destroyed, their state
institutions dismantled and their societies embroiled in sectarian,
tribal strife. As a result, the US wars have not produced a single
functioning client state: the US military invaded, occupied and
destroyed Iraq and Afghanistan while losing the wars in political terns.
This came at no cost to Israel, the unchallenged regional hegemon, while
the US Treasury will struggle with a trillion-dollar price tag and the
US public will experience economic decline for generations.

### ! -- Militarism

#### US Imperialism has shifted at the turn of the century as it first looked to imperialize regions and nations for economic gain before shifting its narrative to a "Global war on Terror" militarization 

#### Petras 20 James Petras is a retired Bartle Professor (Emeritus) of Sociology at Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York and adjunct professor at Saint Mary\'s University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada who has published on political issues with particular focus on Latin America and the Middle East, imperialism, globalization, and leftist social movements *[US Imperialism: The Changing Dynamics of Global Power]{.underline}* 

Over the past half century, the political leadership and strategies of
the imperial state have changed dramatically**[. During the period
1975-1990, the MNCs played a central role in defining the direction of
imperial state policy: leveraging markets in Asia; negotiating market
openings with China; promoting and backing neoliberal military and
civilian regimes in Latin America; installing and financing
pro-capitalist regimes in Russia, Eastern Europe; the Baltic and Balkan
states. Even in cases where the imperial state resorted to military
intervention. Yugoslavia and Iraq, the bombings led to favorable
economic opportunities for the US-based MNCs. The Bush Sr. regime
promoted US oil interests via an oil-for-food exchange agreement with
Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Clinton promoted free market regimes in the
mini- states resulting from the break-up of socialist Yugoslavia.
\"]{.underline}** Towever, the imperial state\'s leadership and policies
shifted dramatically during the late 1990s onward. President Clinton\'s
imperial state was com- posed of long-standing MNC representatives, Wall
Street bankers and newly ascending militarist Zionist officials. **[The
result was a hybrid policy in which the imperial state actively promoted
MC opportunities under neoliberal regimes in the ex-communist countries
of Europe and Latin America and expanded MNC ties with China and Vietnam
while launching destructive military interventions in Somalia,
Yugoslavia and Iraq.]{.underline}** **[The correlation and balance of
force within the imperialist state shifted dramatically in favour the
militarist-Zionist faction with 9/11: the terrorist attack of dubious
origins and false flag demolitions in New York and Washington served to
entrench the militarists in control of a vastly expan- ded imperial
state apparatus.]{.underline}** As a consequence of 9/11, the
militarist-Zio- nist faction of the imperial state subordinated the
interests of the MC to its strategy of total war. **[This in turn led to
the invasion, occupation and destruction of civilian infrastructure in
Iraq and Afghanistan (instead of harnessing it to MNC expansion). The US
colonial regime dismantled the Iraqi state (instead of re-ordering it to
serve the MNC). The assassination and forced out-migration of millions
of skilled professionals, administrators, police and military officials
(rather than their incorporation as servants of the colonial state and
MNCs) crippled any economic recovery.]{.underline}** The
militarist-Zionist ascendancy in the imperial state introduced major
changes in the policy, orientation, priorities and modus operandi of US
imperialism. **[The ideology of the \'global war on terror\' replaced
the MNC doctrine of \'economic globalization.]{.underline}**

### ! -- Military Industrial Complex

**[The power and influence of the military industrial complex in
promoting serial wars has resulted in extraordinary rates of
profit.]{.underline}** According to a recent study by Morgan Stanley
(cited in Baron\'s, 6/9/14, P. 19), **[shares in the major US arms
manufacturers have risen 27,699 percent over the past five years, in
contrast to 6,777 percent for the broader market. In the past three
years alone Raytheon has returned 124 percent, Northrup Grumman 14
percent and Lockheed Martin 149 percent to their investors and
masters.]{.underline}** The **[Obama regime made a grand public show of
reducing the military budget via the annual appropriation bill, and then
turned around and announced emergency supplemental funds to cover the
costs of these wars \... thereby actually increasing military
spending,]{.underline}** all the while waving the banner of cost
cutting\'. **[Obama\'s theatrics fattened the profits for the US
military-industrial complex. War profits have soared with the series of
military interventions in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. Arms
industry lobbyists pressure Congressional and Pentagon decision-makers
to link up with the pro-Israel lobby as it promotes even deeper direct
US military involvement in Syria, Iraq and Iran.]{.underline}** The
growing ties between Israeli and US military industries reinforce their
political leverage in Washington by working with liberal
interventionists and neo-conservatives. They attacked Obama for not
bombing Syria and for his withdrawal of troops from Iraq and
Afghanistan. They then clamored to send US troops back to Iraq and
called for intervention in Ukraine. Obama argued that proxy wars without
direct US troop involvement do not require the heavy Pentagon
expenditures demanded by the arms industry. The Obama regime presented
the withdrawal from rag and Afghanistan as a necessary step to reduce US
financial and military losses. This was in response to Wall Street\'s
pressure to cut the budget deficit. Obama\'s attempt to meet the demands
of the US financial sector came at the price of cutting potential profit
for the military industrial complex as well as infuriating Israel and
its fanatical supporters in Congress. **[In the face of rising domestic
pressure to reduce the budget deficit and cut military spending, the US
military-industrial complex and its Zionist accomplices are fighting to
retain their share by eliminating programs designed to serve the health
needs of active and retired soldiers. Soaring disability costs related
to the recent wars will continue for decades. Veteran healthcare costs
are expected to double to 15 percent of the defense budget in the next
five years.]{.underline}** The **[huge public cost of caring for
soldiers and veterans means \"bad news for defense
stocks\',]{.underline}** according to financial analysts (Baron\'s,
6/9/14, p. 19). **[This is why the arms industries promote the closure
of scores of Veterans Health Administration hospitals and a reduction in
retiree benefits,]{.underline}** using the pretexts of fighting fraud
and incompetence and poor quality service compared with the private
sector. **[The same corporate warlords and lobbyists who clamor to send
US troops back to Iraq and to new wars in Syria and Ukraine, where young
lives, limbs and sanity are at great risk, are also in the forefront of
a fight to slash funding for the veterans\' medical care.]{.underline}**
Economists have long noted **[that the more dollars spent on veterans\'
and military retirees\' healthcare, the less is allocated for war
materials, ships and aircraft. Today it is estimated that over \$900
billion dollars will have been spent on long-term VHA medical and
disability services for veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq.]{.underline}** That number is clearly set to rise with each new
intervention. The corporate warlords are urging Congress to increase
co-pays, enrollment fees and deductibles for veterans, retirees and
active duty personnel enrolled in military health insurance plans such
as Tricare, as well as limiting access to VHA services. **[The fight
over Pentagon expenditures is a struggle over war or social justice:
health services for troops and veterans versus weapons programs that
fatten corporate profits for the arms industry.]{.underline}**

#### Empire's deterritorializing and biopolitical nature results in a collapse of autonomy replaced by a constant conditioning of imperial subjectivity

"Empire" pg 195-198 2000) // ELog

The progressive lack of distinction between inside and outside has
important implications for the social production of subjectivity. [One
of the central and most common theses of the institutional analyses
proposed by modern social theory is that [subjectivity is]{.mark} not
pre-given and original but at least to some degree [formed in]{.mark}
the field of social forces.]{.underline} In this sense, modern social
theory progressively emptied out any notion of a presocial subjectivity
and instead grounded the production of subjectivity in the functioning
of major social institutions, such as the prison, the family, the
factory, and the school. Two aspects of this production process should
be highlighted. [First, subjectivity is [a constant]{.mark} social
[process]{.mark} of generation.]{.underline} When the boss hails you on
the shop floor, or the high school principal hails you in the school
corridor, a subjectivity is formed. The material practices set out for
the subject in the context of the institution (be they kneeling down to
pray or changing hundreds of diapers) are the production processes of
subjectivity. [In a reflexive way, then, through its own actions, [the
subject is]{.mark} acted on, [generated]{.mark}. Second, the
[institutions provide]{.mark} above all [a discrete place]{.mark} (the
home, the chapel, the classroom, the shop floor) [where]{.mark} the
[production of subjectivity is enacted]{.mark}.]{.underline} The various
institutions of modern society should be viewed as an archipelago of
factories of subjectivity. [In the course of a life, [an individual
passes]{.mark} linearly [into and out of these]{.mark} various
[institutions]{.mark} (from the school to the barracks to the factory)
[and is formed by them. The relation between inside and outside is
fundamental. Each institution has its own rules and logics of
subjectivation]{.mark}: ''School tells us, 'You're not at home anymore';
the army tells us, 'You're not in school anymore.' '' 18 Nevertheless,
[within]{.mark} the walls of [each institution the individual is]{.mark}
at least partially [shielded from the]{.mark} forces of the [other
institutions]{.mark}; in the convent one is normally safe from the
apparatus of the family, at home one is normally out of reach of factory
discipline.]{.underline} This clearly delimited place of the
institutions is reflected in the regular and fixed form of the
subjectivities produced. [[In the passage to imperial society]{.mark},
the first aspect of the modern condition is certainly still the case,
that is, subjectivities are still produced in the social factory. In
fact, [the social institutions produce subjectivity in an ever more
intense way]{.mark}.]{.underline} We might say that postmodernism is
what you have when the modern theory of social constructivism is taken
to its extreme and all subjectivity is recognized as artificial. How is
this possible, however, when today, as nearly everyone says, the
institutions in question are everywhere in crisis and continually
breaking down? This general crisis does not necessarily mean that the
institutions no longer produce subjectivity. What has changed, rather,
is the second condition: that is, the place of the production of
subjectivity is no longer defined in this same way. [The crisis means,
in other words, that today the [enclosures that used to define the
limit]{.mark}ed space [of the institutions have broken down]{.mark} so
that the [logic]{.mark} that once functioned primarily within the
institutional walls [now spreads across the entire social terrain.
Inside and outside are becoming indistinguishable]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This omni-crisis of the institutions looks very different in different
cases. For example, continually decreasing proportions of the U.S.
population are involved in the nuclear family, while steadily increasing
proportions are confined to prisons. Both institutions, however, the
nuclear family and the prison, are equally in crisis, in the sense that
the place of their effectivity is increasingly indeterminate. One should
not think that the crisis of the nuclear family has brought a decline in
the forces of patriarchy. On the contrary, discourses and practices of
''family values'' seem to be everywhere across the social field. The old
feminist slogan ''The personal is the political'' has been reversed in
such a way that the boundaries between public and private have
fractured, unleashing circuits of control throughout the ''intimate
public sphere.'' 19 [In a similar way the crisis of the prison means
that [carceral logics]{.mark} and techniques [have]{.mark} increasingly
[spread]{.mark} to other domains of society. [The production of
subjectivity in imperial society tends not to be limited to any specific
places. One is always]{.mark} still [in the family]{.mark}, always still
in [school]{.mark}, always still in [prison]{.mark}, and so forth. In
the general breakdown, then, [the functioning of the institutions
is]{.mark} both [more intensive and more extensive]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The institutions work even though they are breaking down---and perhaps
they work all the better the more they break down. The indefiniteness of
the place of the production corresponds to the indeterminacy of the form
of the subjectivities produced. [[The imperial social institutions might
be seen]{.mark}, then, [in a fluid process of the generation and
corruption of subjectivity]{.mark}. This passage is not isolated to the
dominant countries and regions, but tends to be [generalized]{.mark} to
different degrees [across the world]{.mark}.]{.underline} The apologia
of colonial administration always celebrated its establishment of social
and political institutions in the colonies, institutions that would
constitute the backbone of a new civil society. Whereas in the process
of modernization the most powerful countries export institutional forms
to the subordinated ones, in the present process of postmodernization,
what is exported is the general crisis of the institutions. [The
[Empire]{.mark}'s institutional structure [is]{.mark} like [a software
program that carries a virus along with it]{.mark}, so that it is
continually modulating and corrupting the institutional forms around it.
[The imperial society of control is]{.mark} tendentially
[everywhere]{.mark} the order of the day.]{.underline}

[[Engineered economic collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} The [**[deliberate
destruction of the world]{.mark}** economy]{.underline}, with the
purpose of ushering in a new, digital banking system, which is already
underway (see, e.g. Owen 2021) -- the ultimate goal of the people
driving the 'pandemic' and everything associated with it -- is a
difficult topic to research, given the scarcity of direct evidence in a
univocal manner. That is, one is faced with a set of conditions that is
open to different interpretations. This projected new financial system,
where all 'programmable money' -- actually, 'vouchers' disguised as
money -- will be centrally controlled and used to control people, by
disallowing the purchase of certain items and allowing the purchase of
others (Wallace 2021), is a more difficult topic to write about compared
to the lethal vaccines, given the abundantly available, incontrovertible
evidence concerning the latter. Nevertheless, some such evidence, in the
form of the assessments of the current situation by authorities in the
fields of finance and economics, is available. A summary of their
findings is encountered in the video-interview conducted by Maria Zeee
(2022: 33 min. 22 secs) with Dr Reiner Fuellmich, the lawyer leading
wide-ranging investigations into different aspects of the 'pandemic',
where he remarks that, ["...whatever we're seeing, it is two things:
deliberate destruction of our economies; **[deliberate destruction of
our health]{.mark}**". As the rest of the video-interview sets out,
these things are [being engineered by]{.mark} the]{.underline} global
elites [known variously as [**the globalist cabal**, the **Davos

process people are treated **as 'bare life**]{.mark}'.]{.underline}
Starting on 5 February 2022 Dr Fuellmich and his team commenced what
they called GRAND JURY -- The [Court of Public Opinion (2022), where
panels of authorities in relevant fields addressed 'pandemic'-related
topics at length, including PCR-tests, Injections, Eugenics and
Financial Destruction, on different days. The latter topic was dealt
with by, among others, Patrick Wood (editor and producer of
Technocracy.News), who -- having reconstructed the historical events

#### This new 21^st^ Century Imperialism with the Unites State's wars both minor or major have been associated with the elements of 'capital dis-accumulation' then shifted to two direct forms, military occupation or economic expansion that invoke US imperialism 

#### Petras 20 James Petras is a retired Bartle Professor (Emeritus) of Sociology at Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York and adjunct professor at Saint Mary\'s University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada who has published on political issues with particular focus on Latin America and the Middle East, imperialism, globalization, and leftist social movements *[US Imperialism: The Changing Dynamics of Global Power]{.underline}* 

Despite vast amounts of imperial data to the contrary, the great
majority of writers on imperialism continue to describe and analyze US
imperialism strictly in economic terms that is, as an expansion of
capital accumulation, accumulation on a world scale. In fact**[, the
major and minor US imperial wars have more to do with capital
dis-accumulation, in the sense that trillion-dollar flows have gone out
from the US, hundreds of billions of dollars in profits from resource
sites and exploitable productive industry has been uprooted. At the same
time that the US imperialist state dis-accumulates capital,
multinational corpora- tions, especially in the extractive sector, are
expanding, accumulating capital throughout Latin America and other areas
of the world system. This new configuration of power, the conflicting
and complementary nature of 21st-century US imperialism,]{.underline}**
requires that we anchor our analysis in the real, existing behaviour of
imperial state and extractive capitalist pol- icymakers. The basic
premise informing this essay is that there are **[two increasingly
divergent forms of imperialism: military-driven intervention,
occupation, and domination; and economic expansion and exploitation of
resources and markets by invitation of the host country]{.underline}**.
We will proceed by examining, in a historical-comparative framework, the
choices of imperial strategy and the alternatives that were selected or
rejected. **[Through an analysis of the practical decisions taken
regarding \'imperial expansion\' we can obtain insights into the real
nature of US imperialism. The study of imperial strategic choices, past
and present, state and corporate, requires three levels of analysis:
global, national, and sectoral.]{.underline}**

#### Lesser evil calculations allow for a continuing justification of unethical acts in the name of the greater good. Their approach to politics creates a constant state of exception which is counterproductive and justifies torture and necropolitics

[[If]{.mark},]{.underline} as a friend recently suggested, [[we ought to
construct a monument to our present political culture]{.mark} as a
homage to the principle of the \'lesser evil\'[, it should be made in
the form of the digits 6-6-5]{.mark}]{.underline} built of concrete
blocks, and installed like the Hollywood sign on hillsides or other high
points overlooking city centres. This number, [[one less than the number
of the]{.mark} beast -that of the devil and of [total evil]{.mark}-
might capture [the essence of our humanitarian present obsessed -with
the calculations]{.mark} and calibrations [that]{.mark} seek to
[moderate,]{.mark} ever so slightly, [the evils that it has largely
caused itself. The principle of the lesser evil is]{.mark} often
[presented as a dilemma between]{.mark} two or more bad [choices in
situations where available options]{.mark} are, or [seem to be,
limited.]{.mark} The choice made justifies the pursuit of harmful
actions that would be otherwise deemed unacceptable in the hope of
averting even greater suffering.]{.underline} [Sometimes the principle
is presented as the optimal result of a general field of calculations
that seeks to compare, measure and evaluate different bad consequences
in relation to necessary acts, and then to minimize those
consequences.]{.underline} Both aspects of the principle are understood
as taking place within a dosed system in which those posing the dilemma,
the options available for choice, [the factors to be calculated and [the
very parameters of calculation are unchallenged. Each calculation is
undertaken]{.mark} anew, [as if the previous]{.mark} accumulation of
[events has not taken place, and the future implications are out of
bounds]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those who seek to justify necessary evils
as \'lesser\' ones, especially when searching for a rationale to explain
recent wars and military expeditions, like to appeal to the work of the
fourth-century North African philosopher-theologian St Augustine.
Augustine\'s rejection of the principle of Manichaeism- a world divided
into equally powerful good and evil - meant that he no longer saw evil
as the perfect mirror image of the good; rather, in platonic terms, as a
measure of its absence. Since evil, unlike good, is not perfect and
absolute, it is forever measured and calibrated on a differential scale
of more and less, greater and lesser. Augustine taught that it is not
permissible to practise lesser evils, because to do so violates the
Pauline principle \'do no evil that good may come\'. But- and here lies
its appeal -[[lesser evils might be tolerated when they are deemed
necessary and unavoidable,]{.mark} or when perpetrating an evil results
in the reduction of the overall amount of evil in the
world]{.underline}. One of the examples Augustine gives for such an
economy of lesser and greater evils is a robbery on a crossroads. It is
to this crossroads that other theologists, philosophers and political
theorists will return, to this day, when discussing the dilemma. In
Augustine\'s logic of pre-emption, it is better to kill the would-be
assailant before he kills an innocent traveler. A millennium later and
the armies of Western Christendom passed through this ethicotheological
needle-eye-sized loophole on their way to the catalogue of pillage and
destruction that constituted the crusades. More recently, Pope Benedict
has appealed to the lesser evil principle in a decree permitting the use
of condoms in places inflicted -with high rates of HIV. Similar to the
latter logic of contraception, some in the Vatican thought that implicit
support of the government of Silvio Berlusconi, albeit plagued by sin,
ridicule and corruption, might after all be considered as the lesser
evil in protecting Christian values. In cases such as these, [[the
economy of the lesser ev-il is]{.mark} always [cited as a justification
for breaching rigid rules]{.mark} and entrenched dogma; indeed, it is
often used by those in power as the primary justification [for the very
notion of \'exception\'.]{.mark}]{.underline} In fact, Augustine\'s
discourse of the lesser evil developed at a time when the church had
started to participate in the political government of its subjects and
had acquired considerable financial and military power. Through the
ages, the Christian church increasingly saw its task as keeping human
evil to its minimum level. It pastorally ruled over a vast and complex
intrapersonal economy of merits and faults -of sin, vice and virtue-
operating according to specific rules of circulation and transfer, with
procedures, analyzes, calculations and tactics that allow the exercise
of a specific interplay between conflicting goods and degrees of evil.
In his lectures on the origins of governmentality, Michel Foucault
argued that, [on the basis of this \'economical theology\', the modern,
secular form of governmental power has itself taken on the form of an
economy.]{.underline}10 Lesser Evildoers [The theological origins of the
lesser evil argument]{.underline} still cast a long shadow on the
present. In fact the idiom has become so deeply ingrained, and is
invoked in such a staggeringly diverse set of contexts - from individual
situational ethics and international relations, to attempts to govern
the economics of violence in the context of the \'war on terror\' and
the efforts of human rights and humanitarian activists to manoeuvre
through the paradoxes of aid- that it [seems to have altogether taken
the place previously reserved for the term \'good\']{.underline}.
Moreover, the very evocation of the \'good\' seems to everywhere invoke
the utopian tragedies of modernity, in which evil seemed lurking in a
horrible manichaeistic inversion. If no hope is offered in the future,
all that remains is to insure ourselves against the risks that it poses,
to moderate and lessen the collateral effects of necessary acts, and
tend to those who have suffered as a result. In relation to the \'war on
terror\', the terms of the lesser evil were most clearly and prominently
articulated by former human rights scholar and leader of Canada\'s
Liberal Party Michael lgnatieff. In his book The Lesser Evil, Ignatieff
suggested that in \'balancing liberty against security\' [[liberal
states establish mechanisms to regulate the breach of some human rights
and legal norms, and allow their security services to engage in forms of
extrajuridical violence]{.underline}]{.mark} - which he saw as lesser
evils - [[in order to fend off or minimize potential greater evils, such
as terror attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} on civilians of western states.
If governments need to violate rights in a terrorist emergency, this
should be done, he thought, only as an exception and according to a
process of adversarial scrutiny. \'Exceptions\', Ignatieff states, \'do
not destroy the rule but save it, provided that they are temporary,
publicly justified, and deployed as a last resort. \'12 [The lesser evil
emerges here as a pragmatic compromise, a \'tolerated sin\' that
functions as the very justification for the notion of exception. [State
violence]{.mark} in this model ta[kes part in a necro-economy in which
various types of destructive measure are weighed in a utilitarian
fashion,]{.mark} not only in relation to the damage they produce, but to
the harm they purportedly prevent and even in relation to the more
brutal measures they may help restrain]{.underline}. In this logic, the
problem of contemporary state violence resembles indeed an all-too-human
version of the mathematical minimum problem of the divine calculations
previously mentioned, one tasked with determining the smallest level of
violence necessary to avert the greatest harm. For the architects of
contemporary war this balance is trapped between two poles: keeping
violence at a low enough level to limit civilian suffering, and at a
level high enough to bring a decisive end to the war and bring peace.
Niore recent works by legal scholars and legal advisers to states and
militaries have sought to extend the inherent elasticity of the system
of legal exception proposed by lgnatieff into ways of rewriting the laws
of armed conflict themselves. [[Lesser evil arguments are now used to
defend]{.mark} anything from [targeted assassinations]{.mark} and mercy
killings, [house demolitions, deportation, torture,]{.mark} to the use
of (sometimes) non-lethal [chemical weapons]{.mark}, the use of [human
shields, and]{.mark} even \'the intentional [targeting of]{.mark} some
[civilians]{.mark} if it could save more innocent lives than they
cost'.]{.underline} In one of its more macabre moments it was suggested
that [the atomic bombings of Hiroshima might also be tolerated under the
defence of the lesser evil.]{.underline} Faced with a humanitarian
A-bomb, one might wonder what, in fact, might come under the definition
of a greater evil. Perhaps it is time for the differential accounting of
the lesser evil to replace the mechanical bureaucy of the \'banality of
evil\' as the idiom to describe the most extreme manifestations of
violence. Indeed, it is through this use of the lesser evil that
societies that see themselves as democratic can maintain regimes of
occupation and neo-colonization. Beyond state agents, those
[[practitioners of lesser evils]{.mark},]{.underline} as this book
claims, [[must also include]{.mark} the members of independent
[nongovernmental organizations that make up]{.mark} the ecology of
[contemporary war and crisis zones]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The
lesser evil is the argument of the humanitarian agent that seeks
military permission to provide medicines and aid in places where it is
in fact the duty of the occupying military power to do so, thus saving
the military limited resources. [The lesser evil is often the
justification of the military officer who attempts to administer life
(and death) in an \'enlightened\' manner; it is sometimes, too, the
brief of the security contractor who introduces new and more efficient
weapons and spatia-technological means of domination, and advertises
them as \'humanitarian technology\']{.underline}. In these cases the
logic of the lesser evil opens up a thick political field of
participation bringing together otherwise opposing fields of action, to
the extent that it might obscure the fundamental moral differences
between these various groups. But, [even according to the terms of an
economy of losses and gains, [the concept of the lesser evil risks
becoming counterproductive: less brutal measures are also those that may
be more]{.mark} easily naturalized, [accepted a]{.mark}nd tolerated -
[and]{.mark} hence more frequently [used,]{.mark} with the result that
[a greater evil may be reached cumulatively.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Aff's arbitration and moderation of violence actually perpetuates the logic of violence, which is the root of the aff's impacts

[Divine examination, evaluation, calculation and choice operate thus
within a complex economy in which good and bad could be transferred and
exchanged. Because in this economy all bad things necessarily appear at
their minimum possible level, the world as lived is always necessarily
the best of all possible worlds]{.underline}. \'If a lesser evil is
relatively good,\' Leibniz reasoned, \'so a lesser good is relatively
evil \... to show that an architect could have done better is to find
faults in his work. \' If [this description of the economy of divine
government is already reminiscent of the logic of contemporary wars,
with its own scales of risk and proportionality used to evaluate the
desired and undesired consequences of military acts,]{.underline} it is
hardly surprising to find in it an early reflection on the concept of
\'collateral damage\'. Earlier Christian theology has indeed already
described all bad things that take place as \'the collateral effects of
the good\'. In this immanent order of human and divine life, the
destructive result of floods are nothing but the collateral effect of
necessary rain. In both their theological and military contexts, as
Giorgio Agamben observed, [the collateral effects are
structural]{.underline} rather than accidental. [It is through the
collateral]{.underline} - flood or blood - [that a
government]{.underline} -divine or human[- can demonstrate, indeed
exercise, its power.]{.underline} Unlike the calculations of a God, seen
by the philosophers and the theologians of the eighteenth century as a
perfect mathematician who could undertake instantaneous calculations and
immediately arrive at a precise result, mere [humans must]{.underline}
of course guess, [speculate and hedge their risks as they proceed
towards the future]{.underline} as the blind leading the blind[. It is
for this reason that they ceaselessly seek to develop and perfect all
sorts of technologies and techniques that might allow them to calculate
the effects of violence and might harness its consequences]{.underline}.
It is these techniques and technologies, apparatuses and spatial
arrangements, that are at the heart of this book. Through them,
Pangloss\'s Leibnizian scheme- or is it Leibniz\'s Panglossian
scheme?-of [[the \'best of all possible worlds\' re-emerges in the
progressive tradition of liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here, in its
secularized form, political rather than metaphysical, a similar
structure of the argument sets up the sphere of morality as a set of
calculations aimed to approximate the optimum proportion between common
goods and necessary evils? But as the general outlook of liberalism
shifted from Voltaire\'s and indeed Jeremy Bentham\'s later [[focus on
the \'greater good\' and the responsibility of government to increase
happiness to the greatest number of people]{.mark}, to [the liberal
canards of \'just wars\', and their increasingly sophisticated
technologies for minimizing the number of \'necessary\' corpses, the
search for \'the best of all possible worlds\']{.mark}]{.underline}
started giving ground to the present neo-Panglossian pessimism [[of the
\'least of all possible evils\'.]{.underline} [This book engages with
the problem of violence in its moderation and
minimization,]{.underline}]{.mark} [mostly with state [violence that is
managed according to a similar economy of calculations]{.mark} and
justified as the least possible means. **[The fundamental
point]{.mark}**]{.underline} of this book [**[is that the moderation of
violence is part of the very logic of violence.]{.underline}**
[Humanitarianism,]{.underline}]{.mark} human rights
[[and]{.mark}]{.underline} international [[humanitarian
law]{.mark}]{.underline} (IHL), when abused by state, supra-state and
military action[, [have become the crucial means by which the economy of
violence is calculated and managed]{.mark}]{.underline}. A dose reading
of a series of case studies will show how, [[at present, spatial
organizations and physical instruments, technical standards, procedures
and systems of monitoring - the complex humanitarian
assemblage]{.underline}]{.mark} that philosopher Adi Ophir called 'moral
technologies\' - [[have become the means for exercising contemporary
violence and for governing the displaced, the enemy and the
unwanted]{.mark}.]{.underline} The condition of collusion of these
technologies of humanitarianism, human rights and humanitarian law with
military and political powers is referred to in this book as \'the
humanitarian present\'. [[Within this present condition, all political
oppositions are replaced by the elasticity of degrees, negotiations,
proportions and balances.]{.underline}]{.mark}

MASS PSYCHOSIS A concise and perspicacious account of the phenomenon of
mass psychosis is encountered in a 20-minute video titled 'MASS
PSYCHOSIS --- How an Entire Population Becomes MENTALLY ILL', produced
by After Skool and Academy of Ideas (2021; see also Neil Oliver, 2021).
Confirming what was argued at the outset in this article about the
parallel between the current state of affairs and the European 'witch
craze' of the 16th and 17th centuries, the makers of this video actually
note the same resemblance, also adding the other parallel, namely [the
[rise of totalitarianism]{.mark} in the 20th century]{.underline} (think
of the persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany). [They characterise
['**mass psychosis'**]{.mark} as an 'epidemic of madness' that [emerges
when]{.mark} a large percentage of a [society]{.mark} somehow **['loses
touch with reality']{.mark}** and **[develops a delusional
outlook]{.mark}**.]{.underline} They also note the moral and spiritual
degeneration on the part of people who are drawn into the vortex of such
a mass psychosis, which is accompanied by increasing unreasonableness,
irresponsibility, emotional instability, and unreliability. Echoing the
views of Le Bon and Freud on group behaviour (discussed earlier), it is
pointed out that [a psychotic group is [**likely to commit atrocities**
that individuals would normally refrain from]{.mark}.]{.underline} (This
resonates with some of the video material circulating globally, not on
mainstream media, but on social platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, of
unbelievable, [quasi-psychotic---and **[morally speaking,
unforgivable---behaviour]{.mark}**]{.underline} of Australian police
officers towards 'unvaccinated' people.) The video voiceover also
discusses the psychogenesis of the collective craze in question[, noting
the ['panic phase']{.mark} on the part of individuals that are scared by
inexplicable events. This is [a clear reference to]{.mark} the **[quick
succession of events]{.mark}** that followed the outbreak of a virus
epidemic in Wuhan, China, towards the end of 2019. In the wake of this,
the 'novel coronavirus' rapidly spread around the world, accompanied by
what was **[fear-inspiring pronouncements]{.mark}** by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and other health organisations, as well as
governments, which resulted in national lockdowns of different degrees
of severity (Olivier, 2021). Understandably this gave rise to what
**[quickly became endemic fear of contagion and panic]{.mark}** in the
face of a deadly pathogen. Moreover, in the [development of mass
psychosis,]{.mark} the video informs one, the initial panic typically
makes way for a stage of 'psychotic insight'**[, where fear-inducing
experience is alleviated by the invention of an illogical,
(quasi-)magical, and reassuring explanation of the (frightening) state
of affairs]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Under present 'pandemic' conditions
this seems to apply to at least two things: the initial account of a
natural, zoonotic origin of the virus, and the later, competing account
of an accidental (but possibly deliberate), leak of a genetically
engineered coronavirus, and secondly (more significantly), the present
tendency, globally (on the part of PSYCHOTHERAPY AND POLITICS
INTERNATIONAL 13 OLIVIER PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLE: THERAPEUTIC REFLECTIONS
ON THE 'PANDEMIC' government representatives and the mainstream media),
to play the 'vaccinated' off against the 'unvaccinated' with statements
such as that we are witnessing 'a pandemic of the unvaccinated' (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention \[CDC\] Director Rochelle Walensky on
NBC News, 2021). Someone who makes such statements ignores those
virologists who point out that the 'unvaccinated' are not the ones who
are causally responsible for the emerging so-called 'variants', but that
these are attributable to the fact that the virus mutates in
'vaccinated' people, in response to the 'vaccines'. As stated by
well-known virologist Geert Vanden Bossche (2021), 'Mass vaccination
with imperfect vaccines is prone to promoting propagation of naturally
selected, spike(S)-directed immune escape variants in the population,
and ongoing campaigns are causing the population to place even more
pressure on viral infectiousness.' (para. 5). [Nevertheless, [to those
who have fallen prey]{.mark} to the mass psychosis in question, [putting
the blame]{.mark} on the 'unvaccinated' **[seems like a stroke of genius
that explains the fear-inducing situation.]{.mark}** Addressing this
situation by attempting to [force]{.mark} the 'unvaccinated' to 'take
the shot' **[seems to be a magical antidote to their own
fears]{.mark}**, but [does not alleviate the mass psychosis]{.mark}; in
fact, [it exacerbates this condition]{.mark} In the video under
consideration the **[concept of 'menticide'---the killing of the
mind]{.mark}**---is introduced to explain [how large numbers of people
are subjected to control]{.mark}. In the discussion it becomes clear
that menticide amounts to the systematic destruction of the human spirit
and of free, uncensored thought. The prior stage of fearmongering and
social division or isolation prepares the way for menticide. This
[enables the ruling elite to impose its own]{.mark} (delusional)
[ideology on society, which functions to exacerbate the mass
psychosis]{.mark} in question in so far as **[it offers a (misleading)
framework for understanding]{.mark}** the dystopian events that are
occurring. It comes as no surprise, therefore, to find that, where
menticide happens, totalitarianism is easily established; in fact,
menticide is a constituent of totalitarian rule, in so far as a society
constructed on [delusions lends itself to
totalitarianism]{.mark}.]{.underline} The creators of the 'Mass
Psychosis' video further discuss the highly relevant work of Joost
Meerloo, who wrote The Rape of the Mind (2009). The pertinence of his
work becomes apparent where they note that[: 'Confusion heightens the
susceptibility of a descent into the delusions of
totalitarianism']{.underline} (After Skool and Academy of Ideas, 2021,
11:53). Referring to the historical example of Adolf Hitler, Meerloo
states that: There is another important weapon the totalitarians use in
their campaign to frighten the world into submission. This is the weapon
of psychological shock. Hitler kept his enemies in a state of constant
confusion and diplomatic upheaval\...Hitler was never logical, because
he knew that that was what he was expected to be. Logic can be met with
logic, while illogic cannot -- it confuses those who think straight. The
Big Lie and monotonously repeated nonsense have more emotional appeal in
a cold war than logic and reason. While the enemy is still searching for
a reasonable counter-argument to the first lie, the totalitarians can
assault him with another. (2009, p. 70)

I already mentioned some things that are relevant to this question. The

China and the rest of the world. American working people have gotten
access to high quality products at lower prices made in China. Initially
this consisted of more low-tech products like clothing and toys, and
more recently computers and cell phones. I'm doing this interview right
now on a made-in-China Lenovo computer, which works very well. Also, as
I already mentioned, many American capitalists have benefited. On the
other hand, some American workers have lost jobs when production of the
products of their workplace moved from the US to China. However, the
right way to deal with that is not to promote hostility to a developing
country, but to enact government policies that provide good jobs for
people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own but because of
being displaced by imports in the US. The government could follow such
policies to ensure workers against being harmed by the way global
capitalist competition operates. [[Capitalism]{.mark} always [tends to
put working **people in conflict**]{.mark} with each other and
**[countries in conflict]{.mark}** with each other. It's one of its many
problems. But a worse **[threat of a new cold war]{.mark}** is it tends
not only to worsen global economic performance and global economic
advance, but it **[undermines global cooperation]{.mark}** between the
US and China [that is very necessary to confront]{.mark} such challenges
as [climate change]{.mark} and [pandemics.]{.mark} That is a [very big
cost]{.mark}. And even more serious is [**the danger of war.** The US
leadership doesn't want war]{.mark} with China, but it [could
happen]{.mark} as a result of the US cold war policy **[due to
miscalculation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Specialists who study the
US-China military interactions argue that [there is a dangerously high
chance of an accidental armed conflict starting between the US and
China. I've read that it is particularly dangerous because China has a
significant advantage in conven- tional weaponry in the area around its
borders, which are very far from US borders. And China has more ships,
etc. So, if an armed conflict began, the US side might be faced with the
choice between losing the conflict or initiating a nuclear strike. So,
it would be a very dangerous situation.]{.underline} There is an
organization in the US that formed about six months ago called the
Committee for a SANE U.S.-China Policy. The name is modeled after a
famous organization from the days of the nuclear arms race in the 1950s
and 1960s called the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy that in the end
was very influential in getting nuclear bomb testing halted and arms
control agreements signed between the US and the Soviet Union. The
Committee for a SANE U.S.-China Policy is run by progressive activists
who are concerned about world peace. It focuses on demanding that the US
change its policy toward China. It has been doing very good work in
exposing the dangers of this new cold war. It has been warning that it
may lead to a hot war and the US has to change its policies as soon as
possible. QY: What could be done by both governments in order to avoid
harmful consequences? DK: Let me start with the US side. In my view,
[the **[US government should turn away from promoting a new cold
war.]{.mark}** The US government should **[accept China and all other
states as equal partners]{.mark}** in the world, **[giving up the drive
to dominate the world.]{.mark}** The US government should adopt some of
the practices China has followed such as industrial policy, big
investments in science and technology, infrastructure investment, and
even some state-owned enterprises, particularly in the financial
sector.]{.underline} These would be very helpful for stabilizing the US
economy and assuring that credit flows to productive pur- poses rather
than speculation. But such policies should be undertaken not to target
another country, not to defeat another country, not to keep the US
dominant as is the case with the USICA I mentioned before, but to
strengthen and improve the US econ- omy. Such an approach would benefit
the American people and people in other countries who buy US products.

[[Saying that Empire is good in itself]{.mark}, however, [does not mean
that it is good for itself. Although Empire]{.mark} may have [played a

those it destroyed]{.mark}.]{.underline} The end of the dialectic of
modernity has not resulted in the end of the dialectic of exploitation.
Today nearly all of humanity is to some degree absorbed within or
subordinated to the networks of capitalist exploitation. [[We

Multiplicity is becoming the exclusive horizon of our political
imagination. [The most [inspiring movements of the]{.mark} past
[decade]{.mark}s, from Cochabamba to Standing Rock, Ferguson to Cape
Town, Cairo to Madrid, [have been animated by]{.mark} multitudes.
[Leaderlessness]{.mark} is the label often given to these uprisings,
especially by the media: and indeed, they reject traditional forms of
centralized leadership, attempting to create new democratic forms of
expression.]{.underline} But rather than describing them as leaderless,
it is more useful to understand them as multitude struggles---useful, in
part, because it allows us to grasp both their virtues and the
challenges they face. These movements have achieved important results;
they have often alluded to an alternative, better world. But they have
generally been short-lived and many have suffered defeat, with some
witnessing their gains brutally reversed. Something more is needed; and,
as militants of various stripes will tell you, creative and original
thinking about political organization is urgently required. We have no
interest in lecturing these movements about the need to abandon their
multiplicity and construct a unified political subject, be it a
centralized leadership council, an electoral party or 'a people'. [A
return to [traditional]{.mark} forms of [organization is not likely to
result in more]{.mark} lasting or [effective movements]{.mark}; in any
case, they have been explicitly repudiated by the democratic
sensibilities of the activists themselves.]{.underline} Furthermore, we
do not believe, to put it in abstract terms, that only 'the one' can
decide. [[The]{.mark} most important [question]{.mark} for us [is: how
can a multiplicity act politically]{.mark}, with the sustained power to
bring about real social transformation[?]{.mark}]{.underline} It may be
helpful here to step back twenty years and approach our contemporary
situation from that vantage point. To explore the potential of today's
movements, we trace two historical and theoretical passages: from class
to multitude and from multitude to class. This may at first appear as a
pendulum action, a simple round trip; but we intend it to mark a
theoretical and political advance, since the 'class' at the departure is
not the same as that at arrival: the passage through multitude
transforms its meaning. [The general formula of organization [we
propose]{.mark}, then, is C--M--C\', [class--multitude--class
prime]{.mark}.[31](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-31)]{.underline}
As in Marx's formula, the importance rests on the transformation
undergone at the centre of the process. Class prime must be a
multitudinous class, an intersectional class. From class to multitude
[The movement from [class to multitude names]{.mark}, in part,
[the]{.mark} general [recognition]{.mark} over the last several decades
[that the working class must be understood in terms of
multiplicity]{.mark}, both within and outside its domain---a shift that
corresponds to the emptying-out of claims to represent the working class
by traditional parties and syndicalist institutions. As an empirical
formation, of course, [the working class]{.mark} has [never
ceased]{.mark} to exist. [But]{.mark} since [its internal composition
has changed]{.mark}---with novel forms of work, new labouring conditions
and wage relations---new investigations of class composition are
required.]{.underline} In particular, these should explore the powers of
social cooperation and the common. [In addition, the [differences among
labouring populations]{.mark}, which have always existed, now
increasingly [refuse unitary representation]{.mark}. Differences among
[sectors of labour]{.mark}---for instance, between waged and unwaged
work, stable and precarious employment, documented and undocumented
workers---along with differences of [gender, race and
nationality]{.mark}, which to some extent map on to those differences of
work status, [all demand expression. ]{.mark}]{.underline}Any
investigation of class composition at this point---and any proposition
of class-political projects---has to be embedded in intersectional
analysis. [[This is not a class]{.mark}, one might say, if by class one
understands a subject that is internally unified, or can be represented
as a unified whole; [it is a multitude]{.mark}, an irreducible
multiplicity. At the same time, the [passage from class to multitude
means]{.mark} that the [struggles of the working class]{.mark}, and
anticapitalist struggles in general, [must be cast]{.mark} together and
[on an equal basis with struggles against other axes of
domination]{.mark}: feminist, antiracist, decolonial, queer, anti-ablist
and others (theorists of multiplicity are not troubled by open sets and
unending lists). In this sense, the concept of [the multitude is closely
allied with]{.mark}---and, indeed, profoundly indebted
to---[intersectional analysis]{.mark} and practice, which emerges from
the theoretical practice of us black feminism.]{.underline}
Intersectionality, at the most basic level, is a political theory of
multiplicity. It aims to counter traditional single-axis frameworks of
political analysis by recognizing the interlocking nature of race,
class, sex, gender and national hierarchies. [This means, first, that
[no one structure of domination is primary to]{.mark} (or reducible to)
the [others]{.mark}. Instead, [they]{.mark} are relatively autonomous,
[have equal significance and are mutually
constitutive]{.mark}.]{.underline} Second, just as structures of
domination are characterized by multiplicity, so too are the
subjectivities that stand in relation to them. This does not imply
either a rejection of identity or a cumulative, additive conception of
many identities; rather, it requires a rethinking of subjectivity in the
key of
multiplicity.[32](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-32)
The call for intersectional multitudes is not merely an appeal for
greater inclusion but rather, as Jennifer Nash says, 'an
antisubordination project'---that is, a combative, revolutionary
strategy on multiple fronts
simultaneously.[33](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-33)
It may be helpful at this point to consider the passage from class to
multitude through the concept of precarity, in two senses. The first
sense of precarity, mainly developed among European theorists and
activists, is conceived primarily in terms of wage and labour
relations.[34](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-34)
Precarity in this sense marks a contrast to the stable employment
contracts that served as a regulative ideal in the Fordist economy of
the mid-20th century---a regulative ideal that existed as a reality only
for a limited number of (generally male) industrial workers in the
dominant countries. Guaranteed labour contracts and laws that protect
workers' rights have been progressively eroded, and workers have been
forced to accept informal, short-term labour contracts. These labour
arrangements have always been raced and gendered, of course; but all
sectors of the workforce are being affected by this trend, albeit in
different ways and measures. This precaritization of labour is a
powerful weapon in the grand arsenal of neoliberalism. Another sense of
precarity, more developed by us writers, provides a useful complement,
and again serves as part of an interpretation of---and challenge
to---neoliberalism, but from a much broader perspective. Precarity,
writes Judith Butler, 'designates that politically induced condition in
which certain populations suffer from failing social and economic
networks of support more than others, and become differentially exposed
to injury, violence and
death.'[35](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-35)
Labour precarity is certainly part of the mix, but the notion of
precarious life aims to grasp how legal, economic and governmental
changes have increased the insecurity of a wide range of already
subordinated populations---women, trans people, gay and lesbian
populations, people of colour, migrants, the disabled and others. There
is thus one notion of precarity that speaks the language of the working
class and another that promotes an intersectional vision. Put them
together and you have a good foundation for theorizing the multitude.
[We do not pose this [movement from class to multitude]{.mark} (or from
the people to the multitude) as a political mandate. That is not
necessary, because it [is already an accomplished fact]{.mark} that has
manifested itself over the past twenty years in different countries and
social contexts.]{.underline} We understand that many regard the
historical shift from class to multitude as a decline and a loss,
beginning with the diminished power and membership of institutional
trade unions and working-class parties (and, indeed, not every
multiplicity is politically progressive; crowds and mobs are just as
likely to be reactionary). But we should also recognize all that has
been gained in the process. At the level of analysis, it should be
obvious that the multiplicity of mutually constituting structures of
domination offers a superior lens for grasping our social reality, and
this requires supplementing our brief investigation of capitalist rule
with equal analyses of the institutional structures of race, gender and
sexual hierarchies. But it is most crucial at the level of practice:
there will be no successful and sustained project of class politics
today that is not also feminist, antiracist and queer. Rethinking class
[[Yet to theorize multiplicity]{.mark}, or even to recognize existing
multiplicities, [is not enough]{.mark}---especially if by multiplicity
one means simply fracturing and separation. [To be]{.mark} politically
[effective, organization is required]{.mark}.]{.underline} And when
dealing with multiplicities, that pressure is even more intense. [To
respond to our initial question---how can a multiplicity decide and act
politically?---[simply]{.mark} by [saying]{.mark} that [it needs to
organize, is not]{.mark} yet very [helpful. The next step]{.mark}, then,
[requires a]{.mark} return to the concept of class---but [class
conceived differently]{.mark} now---in order to explore more fully what
a multitude can become and how it can act politically.]{.underline} One
obvious objection to the proposal of this second movement, from
multitude to class, is that it unravels all the advantages achieved in
the previous movement, from a unified political conception based on a
single axis of domination, that determined by capital, to a
multiplicity, which also engages patriarchy, white supremacy and other
axes. [Our intention, however, is to develop [a conception of class
that]{.mark} refers not only to the working class but [is itself a
multiplicity]{.mark}, a political formation that makes good on the gains
of the multitude]{.underline}. It may be helpful, first of all, simply
to note authors who use the concept of class beyond reference to the
working class, in order to address race, gender domination and struggle.
Achille Mbembe, for instance, analyses the contemporary modes of control
deployed against Africans migrating to Europe in terms of a 'racial
class': Europe has decided not only to militarize its frontiers but to
extend them into the far distance . . . \[its borders\] are now located
all along the shifting routes and torturous paths trodden by the
candidates for migration, relocating to keep on top of their
trajectories . . . In reality, it is the body of the African, of every
African taken individually, and of all Africans as a racial class that
constitutes today the borders of Europe. This new type of human body is
not only the skin-body and the abject body of epidermal racism, that of
segregation. It is also the border-body, which traces the limit between
those who are 'us' and those who are not, and whom one can maltreat with
impunity.[36](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-36)
In the new global regime of mobility, Mbembe claims, Africans will be
transformed into 'a stigmatized racial class'. For him, the concept of
class here is not, or not only, a socio-economic category. It serves
instead as a means to think collective racial difference that is not
merely based on skin colour; this racial class is born in the racist
structures and institutions of Europe. Mbembe's references here echo
1970s feminists like Christine Delphy, who employed the concept 'sex
class' to understand patriarchal domination and to designate a basis of
feminist struggle. To other feminists who challenged her usage, Delphy
responded that the concept of class could grasp better than any other
how subordinate social subjects are created by relations of domination.
From this perspective, Delphy writes, 'one cannot consider each group
separate from the other because they are united by a relation of
domination . . . The groups are not . . . constituted before they are
put in relation. On the contrary, their relation is what constitutes
them as
such.'[37](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-37)
Here, then, relations of domination are prior to and constitutive of
social subjects. In Delphy's usage, again, class refers not exclusively
to economic status, but instead involves an analytical procedure that
can be deployed with respect to any axis of domination. [Our interest in
these analyses of Mbembe and Delphy is, first, to highlight this
point---that [the concept of class can]{.mark} be used to [grasp]{.mark}
the effects of subjection created by [relations of domination, not
only]{.mark} with respect to [capital]{.mark} but also with respect to
white supremacy and patriarchy, in the interests of not only the working
class but also the racial class, the sex class and others. Second, it is
important to stress that [the concept of class is]{.mark} employed here
[not only as a descriptive claim but as a political call]{.mark} to
those subjected to patriarchal or racial hierarchies to struggle
together, as a
class.[38](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-38)
Finally, and this is the point most difficult to confront: [to recognize
a plurality of classes]{.mark} dominated and struggling in parallel
fashion is a step forward, but [is not enough]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
notion of 'multitudinous class' or 'intersectional class' that we seek
requires a further step: an internal articulation of these different
subjectivities---working class, racial class, sex class---in struggle.
[[Intersectional analyses]{.mark} commonly address the need for
articulation between the subordinated subjectivities in terms of
solidarity and coalition. [Often]{.mark} this [repeat]{.mark}s [an
additive strategy: working-class plus feminist plus antiracist]{.mark}
plus lgbtq struggle, plus . . . In other words, even when intersectional
analysis refuses additive notions of identity, an additive logic can
still govern activist imaginaries. One weakness of this approach is that
[the bonds of solidarity are external. What is needed are internal bonds
of solidarity]{.mark}---that is, a different mode of articulation, going
[beyond]{.mark} standard conceptions of [coalition]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Let us illustrate this key condition---the internal relations of
solidarity in this multitudinous class---with three theoretical
examples. First, Rosa Luxemburg: after the failed 1905 insurrection in
Russia, Luxemburg criticized the German proletariat and its party for
their expressions of sympathy and support for their Russian cousins,
whether tinged with condescension or admiration. Luxemburg was not, of
course, advocating that German workers disengage from, or pay less
attention to, the Russian struggles---exactly the opposite. The problem
for her was that such expressions of 'international class solidarity'
posed merely an external relation: German revolutionaries needed to
recognize instead that the Russian events were their own affair and
internal to their struggle, 'a chapter of their own social and political
history'.[39](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-39)
[A second theoretical example: [Iris Young]{.mark} in the early 1980s
challenged male socialists who profess solidarity with the feminist
movement.]{.underline} 'By and large', she writes, 'socialists do not
consider fighting women's oppression as a central aspect of the struggle
against capitalism
itself.'[40](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-40)
Note that Young is not addressing the misogynist and anti-feminist male
socialists, of whom there were many, but instead the supportive male
comrades who offer solidarity to feminists, or who see feminist struggle
as allied with but separate from their own. Like Luxemburg, Young
charges that such solidarity is not enough. [She [exhorts male
socialists]{.mark}, in effect, [to recognize feminist struggle]{.mark}
against patriarchy [as a chapter of their own]{.mark} social and
political history. [You cannot]{.mark} really [be anticapitalist
without]{.mark} also [being feminist because]{.mark}, since [they are
mutually constitutive]{.mark}, capital cannot be defeated without also
defeating patriarchy.]{.underline} A third example: Keeanga-Yamahtta
Taylor makes a parallel argument addressing antiracist activists in the
us who do not also focus on class domination. Too often, she maintains,
there is a kind of segregation of struggles, such that anticapitalist
struggles are assumed to be the task of white people, while people of
colour must conduct antiracist struggles. 'No serious socialist current
in the last hundred years', Taylor writes, 'has ever demanded that Black
or Latino/a workers put their struggles on the back burner while some
other class struggle is waged first. This assumption rests on the
mistaken idea that the working class is white and male, and therefore
incapable of taking up issues of race, class and gender. In fact, the
American working class is female, immigrant, Black, white, Latino/a and
more. Immigrant issues, gender issues and antiracisms are working-class
issues.'[41](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii120/articles/empire-twenty-years-on#note-41)
This is not a matter of accepting the participation of allies or
expressing solidarity; the struggle against white supremacy and that
against capital must be understood as internal to one another. The
objection at this point might be: yes, they all need to struggle
together because they are all precarious in the two senses discussed
earlier; but such a projection of sameness is not helpful, because the
modes of precarity and domination are different. We need to maintain the
conception of multiplicity---capitalist domination is not the same as
gender or race domination, and one cannot be subsumed under another.
Instead of a reduction to sameness, this argument requires an
articulation among the subjectivities in struggle. This is why class---a
multitudinous class---rather than coalition seems to us the appropriate
concept. [But this is [a]{.mark} notion of [class]{.mark} that is not
only [composed of]{.mark} a [multiplicity]{.mark}, and grounded in forms
of social cooperation and the common, [but also]{.mark} articulated by
[internal bonds of solidarity]{.mark} and intersection among struggles,
each [recognizing that the others are 'a chapter of their own]{.mark}
social and political history'.]{.underline} That is its mode of
articulation, its mode of assembly. [This [is]{.mark} why we call this
transformed notion '[class prime']{.mark}, so that instead of
class--multitude--class, the entire movement we are trying to sketch is
class--multitude--class prime: C--M--C\'. This serves at least as an
initial theoretical response to our earlier question: [can a
multiplicity act politically? Yes]{.mark}, it can do so [as class
prime]{.mark}, as an internally articulated multiplicity oriented
equally in struggle against capital, patriarchy, white supremacy and
other axes of domination.]{.underline} Granted, it is merely a formal,
conceptual response, but perhaps it can offer a framework for thinking
and pursuing that political project. 6. in praise of alterglobalization
On 1 January 1994, the day that nafta went into effect, the Zapatista
Army of National Liberation launched an insurrection in Chiapas, Mexico;
on 30 November 1999, protesters in Seattle blocked the meetings of the
World Trade Organization; on 25 January 2001, the World Social Forum was
inaugurated in Porto Alegre, Brazil, counterposing itself to the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland; and on 21 July 2001, multitudes
flooded the streets of Genoa to protest the G8 summit. [[The
international cycle of alterglobalization struggles]{.mark} that
developed in the Americas and Europe [had numerous defects]{.mark}:
their nomadic nature and the practices of 'summit-hopping' in many cases
eclipsed engagement with local, sustained organizing; they were
frequently criticized, most strongly by activists within the movements
themselves, for failing to develop sufficiently the intersectional
characteristics we have just outlined; and the season of struggles
proved relatively short, due in part to their own organizational
weaknesses. One should keep in mind, of course, that [the movements
were]{.mark} also [closed down by]{.mark} the [severe security
regimes]{.mark} installed after September 11th; activists had to shift
their focus from alterglobalization to anti-war movements.]{.underline}
The extraordinary virtue of these protests was their theoretical
practice. They constructed a global critical vision and were able,
through their orchestrated events, to render legible the political
significance of the relatively obscure realm of the global economic
institutions. Rather than a movement, then, they might be better
understood as a vast collective co-research investigation into the
nature of the emerging global order. Activists knew that the major
corporations and dominant nation-states, the United States first among
them, had enormous power; but they also had the intuition that the
global order was something more---and that it was here, at the global
level, that the contemporary structures of domination must be
understood. Each event illuminated another node of the emerging network
of the global power structure: the wto, World Bank, imf, G8, trade
agreements and so forth. The cycle of alterglobalization movements was
thus a massive pedagogical project for those who participated in
them---and for anyone else who was willing to learn. Since then,
although the relative positions of the various powers within its mixed
constitution have risen and fallen, the forces of domination and control
of the global order have by no means lessened, despite the braying of
the ideologues of national sovereignty. They have instead merely receded
from view and become less legible, as if they had discovered an
invisibility potion. [[We need]{.mark} today [an international cycle of
struggles]{.mark} with the intelligence [to investigate the structures
of the ruling global order]{.mark}.]{.underline} Sometimes, after all,
the theoretical work done in social movements teaches us more than that
written in libraries. [Reversing their invisibility is the first step
toward being able [to challenge and eventually overthrow]{.mark} the
structures of [Empire]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The other head of the imperial eagle is the plural multitude of
productive, creative subjectivities of globalization that have learned
to sail on this enormous sea. They are in perpetual motion and they form
constellations of singularities and events that impose continual global
reconfigurations on the system. This perpetual motion can be
geographical, but it can refer also to modulations of form and processes
of mixture and hybridization. The relationship between ''system'' and
''asystemic movements'' cannot be flattened onto any logic of
correspondence in this perpetually modulating atopia.21 Even the
asystemic elements produced by the new multitude are in fact global
forces that cannot have a commensurate relationship, even an inverted
one, with the system. [[Every insurrectional event]{.mark} that erupts
within the order of the imperial system [provokes a shock to the system
in its entirety]{.mark}.]{.underline} From this perspective, the
institutional frame in which we live is characterized by its radical
contingency and precariousness, or really by the unforeseeability of the
sequences of events---sequences that are always more brief or more
compact temporally and thus ever less controllable.22 It becomes ever
more difficult for Empire to intervene in the unforeseeable temporal
sequences of events when they accelerate their temporality. [The most
relevant aspect that the [struggles]{.mark} have demonstrated may be
sudden accelerations, often cumulative, that can become virtually
simultaneous, explosions that [reveal]{.mark} a properly [ontological
power and]{.mark} unforeseeable [attack on the]{.mark} most [central
equilibria of Empire]{.mark}]{.underline}. Just as Empire in the
spectacle of its force continually determines systemic recompositions,
so too new figures of resistance are composed through the sequences of
the events of struggle. [[This is]{.mark} another [fundamental]{.mark}
characteristic [of the]{.mark} existence of the [multitude today, within
Empire and against Empire. ]{.mark}]{.underline}New figures of struggle
and new subjectivities are produced in the conjuncture of events, in the
universal nomadism, in the general mixture and miscegenation of
individuals and populations, and in the technological metamorphoses of
the imperial biopolitical machine. [These [new]{.mark} figures and
[subjectivities]{.mark} are produced because, although the struggles are
indeed antisystemic, they are not posed merely against the imperial
system---they [are not simply negative]{.mark} forces. [They]{.mark}
also express, nourish, and [develop positive]{.mark}ly their own
constituent [projects; they work toward]{.mark} the [liberation]{.mark}
of living labor, creating constellations of powerful singularities.
[This]{.mark} constituent [aspect of the]{.mark} movement of [the
multitude]{.mark}, in its myriad faces, [is]{.mark} really [the positive
terrain]{.mark} of the historical construction [of Empire]{.mark}. This
is not a historicist positivity but, on the contrary, [a
positivity]{.mark} of the res gestae [of the multitude]{.mark}, an
[antagonistic and creative]{.mark} positivity. [The deterritorializing
power of the multitude]{.mark} is the productive force that [sustains
Empire and at the same time]{.mark} the force that [calls for]{.mark}
and makes necessary [its destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline} At this
point, however, we should recognize that our metaphor breaks down and
that the two-headed eagle is not really an adequate representation of
the relationship between Empire and the multitude, because it poses the
two on the same level and thus does not recognize the real hierarchies
and discontinuities that define their relationship. [[From one
perspective Empire stands]{.mark} clearly [over the multitude]{.mark}
and subjects it to the rule of its overarching machine, [as a new
Leviathan]{.mark}. At the same time, however, from the perspective of
social productivity and creativity, [from]{.mark} what we have been
calling [the ontological perspective, the hierarchy is reversed. The
multitude is the real productive force of our social world, whereas
Empire is a mere apparatus of capture that lives only off]{.mark} the
vitality of [the multitude]{.mark}---as Marx would say, a vampire regime
of accumulated dead labor that survives only by sucking off the blood of
the living.]{.underline} Once we adopt this ontological standpoint, we
can return to the juridical framework we investigated earlier and
recognize the reasons for the real deficit that plagues the transition
from international public law to the new public law of Empire, that is,
the new conception of right that defines Empire. In other words, the
frustration and the continual instability suffered by imperial right as
it attempts to destroy the old values that served as reference points
for international public law (the nation-states, the international order
of Westphalia, the United Nations, and so forth) along with the
so-called turbulence that accompanies this process are all symptoms of a
properly ontological lack. As it constructs its supranational figure,
power seems to be deprived of any real ground beneath it, or rather, it
is lacking the motor that propels its movement. The rule of the
biopolitical imperial context should thus be seen in the first instance
as an empty machine, a spectacular machine, a parasitical machine. [A
new sense of being is imposed on the constitution of Empire by the
creative movement of [the multitude]{.mark}, or really it [is]{.mark}
[continually present]{.mark} in this process [as an alternative
paradigm. It is internal to Empire and pushes forward its
constitution]{.mark}, not as a negative that constructs a positive or
any such dialectical resolution. Rather it acts [as an absolutely
positive force that pushes the dominating power toward]{.mark} an
abstract and empty [unification, to which it appears as the distinct
alternative. ]{.mark}]{.underline}From this perspective, when the
constituted power of Empire appears merely as privation of being and
produc-tion, as a simple abstract and empty trace of the constituent
power ofthe multitude, then we will be able to recognize the real
standpoint of our analysis. It is a standpoint that is both strategic
and tactical, when the two are no longer different.

### Alt -- Disruption

#### Debate as a game is one that operates under a systemic approach that allows us to conceive of alternative futures. The role of debate should be to conceptualize the best schema for disrupting systems of Empire and the colonialist legacy that structures modern IR. This allows us to imagine worlds outside the confines of western sociality.

This article revisits the intellectual history behind Nick
Dyer-Witheford and Greig de Peuter's Games of Empire (2009) and builds
on their work to think further about how we might politically analyse
games, especially in relationship to new forms of social organisation in
the future. **[The worlds of games are important places for us to think
about time, as demonstrated by historical game studies in evaluating the
past, but there is a role for games to help us consider the future as
well. Because games are, to some extent, systems, they facilitate a
systems thinking approach that connects the material to the
immaterial.]{.underline}** Because games also tend to be action-based,
they allow thinking through of acts as well as representations. Games
allow us to think about a time and place that is different from the
present and how it might operate as a system that we could live in. Our
speculation on the future can make use of games that both do and do not
align with our individual politics. We do not need to see games as
representing only the world we want to live in but also to think about
worlds to avoid, as both utopian and dystopian projections of the future
can shape our acts in the present. The role that Games of Empire (2009)
plays in this picture is to expose the alignments and disjunctures
between the ideologies that a game presents and the means by which games
are produced. [The possible futures offered by different games can be
critiqued in relationship to their conditions of production. Games of
Empire emerges out of games studies, but perhaps, it owes a greater
intellectual debt to the history of post-autonomist Marxist
scholarship]{.underline}. Dyer-Witheford was among the first anglophone
interlocutors of autonomism in media studies with his work Cyber-Marx
(1999), and this trajectory continues into Games of Empire with de
Peuter. Unlike Cyber-Marx, which draws a great deal on the Italian
autonomia movements of Italy in the 1960s and 1970s, Games of Empire
takes the post-autonomist work of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's
Empire trilogy (2000, 2004, 2009) as its reference point. [The question
raised is simply worded but impossibly complex: what is the future we
are after]{.underline}? In this article, I argue that the historical
game studies framework of experimenting with history through games can
also be used to open up politically useful gaming experiments for the
future. Indeed, as I will show, the post-autonomist lineage that
Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter draw upon is predicated on theories of
political resistance that are developed through experimentation in new
social forms. I argue that games can be a component for thinking about
the possibilities that the future might hold, both for understanding how
we might organise economically but also for thinking about what problems
we might face. Like video games, post-autonomism concerns itself with a
practical focus on the future. I argue that a post-autonomist method of
games analysis requires an explicitly political interpretation that is
focused on trying to imagine a political future through experiments in
gaming. Marxist Theoretical Lineages for Games of Empire Dyer-Witheford
and de Peuter draw primarily on the work of Hardt and Negri's Empire
trilogy (2000, 2004, 2009) as their core theoretical background and also
make use of key works by other Italian Marxists such as Virno (2004),
Lazzarato (1996) and Tronti (1966/2019). These scholars can be broadly
categorised as post-autonomists, as they are inheritors of the autonomia
movement of the 1970s, itself largely drawing on prior Italian Marxists
such as Antonio Gramsci (see also Dyer-Witheford, 1999; Wright, 2002).
Autonomia formed in response to the roboticisation of Italian automobile
factories; this reduced wages and the need for specialised labour, while
also undermining the union movement's bargaining power. Traditional
forms of factory-based strikes were no longer sufficient as mass skilled
workers were replaced by machines. Instead work was reframed around
informational, affective and intellectual forms of labour and the
creation of social or cultural commodities, accordingly new forms of
social resistance became necessary. Autonomia experimented with new
forms of social organisation both inside and outside the factory walls.
[The autonomia movement was defined by a core Gramscian framework and
the significant influence of feminist scholarship from Lotta Feminista.
These approaches drew attention to how labour was arranged outside the
space of the factory through a particular attention to social
reproduction, that is the focus on the creation of social subjects
within capitalism, especially in gendered forms of labour]{.underline}.
This is accounted for in works by Dalla Costa and James (1971), Federici
(1984/2004), Fortunati (1996) and more recently Terranova (2000). A wide
array of unique theoretical positions and crises emerged over this time
within Italian Marxism that led to numerous splits and divisions (see
Bologna, 1980; Tronti, 2012; Wright, 2002, p. 11--21). From this period,
Italian Marxism was defined by an interest in networked, affective,
militant and collaborative approaches that tended to reject
institutions, including unions and political parties (see Lotringer &
Marazzi, 2007). Autonomia was defined by a new community of activism
that -- however incomplete or partial -- included a diverse collection
of identities recognising a common problem. [Hardt and Negri's Empire
trilogy responds to this period and is post-autonomist insofar as the
autonomist tendency significantly shifted in terms of its idea of the
subject and in terms of its idea of the factory. Not least of which is
the fact that the autonomist focuses on the changes in the workplace due
to robotics, computers and a shift towards valorising intellectual work
over manual labour has found a great deal of purchase in explaining
contemporary trends in technology and work]{.underline}. **[Their thesis
is that the world had been organised by a political rationality that had
reorganised nation states into a single system that facilitated these
changes, a world order they call 'Empire']{.underline}**. Empire was to
politics what capitalism was to the economy, and they worked hand in
glove to expand and accumulate. **[Empire is not found in a single
source but is present in a diverse array of state bodies and
international treaties and fostered through practices such as trade
liberalisation and expansion of property systems]{.underline}**.
Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter thoroughly demonstrate the value of
postautonomist language in unpacking the multilayered, intertwined
cultural, ideological and political economic components in digital video
games. They have drawn on the autonomist and post-autonomist histories
of language and globalisation, material and immaterial labour, and
imperialist expansion and ideology. Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter see
gaming as having a potential role in an emancipatory praxis; video
gaming's status as exemplary media of Empire (2009, p. xxix) means that
it is ideal for representing imperial systems and also for submitting
them to critique. **[My contribution to this discussion is to note that
games provide an important form of critique: alternatives to Empire.
Experimentation and imagination about the future are political
necessities within post-autonomist scholarship. In their critique of
Empire, Hardt and Negri (2009) note that while it is all well and good
to critique what we have, there needs to be some sort of orienting
positive force that allows us to create the world after
Empire]{.underline}**. The problem with the present moment is that it
not only suffuses material politics but has also infected our
imagination of the future. **[We need to develop new ideas about how we
might live and think together and to identify new social and economic
systems for living.]{.underline}** Problem of Imagining a Future In each
of their books, Hardt and Negri ask 'what is to be done' to move past
Empire. [This recalls the post-autonomist theory of exodus: the idea of
transiting from a present crisis into a new, real space that may provide
us with better conditions of existence (see Virno, 1996]{.underline}).
If we are to move past the space of Empire, then we must have a model or
idea of what we are going to build. The problem of imagining the future
of the world past capitalism has been articulated in academic contexts
at least since the 1970s by Franklin (1979) in an evaluation of Ballard.
Franklin critiques Ballard's 'The Subliminal Man' (1963) as
misapprehending the end of capitalism as the end of the world itself
that Ballard himself could not think of a world past capitalism and that
capitalism's absence could only be accepted if it also meant the end of
everything. Later interlocutors such as Jameson (1994) and Zi ˇ zek
(1994) ˇ generalised the problem from an individual pathology to a
social one: the population at large struggles to conceive of a world
past capitalism, where capitalism cannot be seen to thrive, hence the
quote that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of
capitalism. **[The ideological nature of the problem is posed by Fisher
(2009) who notes that capitalism, like all ideological systems, contains
within it an assertion of its own natural continuation. This problem --
the inability to think of a future that is substantively different -- is
difficult to resolve. For Hardt and Negri, Empire infects everything so
profoundly that we cannot think of its responses. This does not mean
that games naturally produce a new political horizon]{.underline}**. [As
Hutchins (2008) has noted, the goal of a politics built from play cannot
be left to ideas of fraternity or camaraderie naturally emerging out of
an 'Olympism', where controlled competition would necessarily lead to a
form of community]{.underline}. Hutchins critiques the idea that a
natural liberal politics might harmoniously emerge from institutional
play, even when such institutions have strongly didactic positions on
what should emerge from play; something new emerges but not necessarily
in a predictable way. We cannot leave our analysis of games to only
address the apparent, didactic and marketised presentation of what the
future might look like. What is necessary are forms of experimentation
that allow us to think beyond the present moment. The post autonomist
theory provides the concept of the laboratory (Hardt, 1996) as a way of
thinking on the new forms of social organisation that might help us move
into the future. This is a task that, by its nature as an evaluation of
a situation that does not yet exist, is accomplished through
speculation, the application of theory and the inspirations of fiction.
Other scholars, such as Jameson (1984) and Hage (2012), note the
centrality of the imagination of the future as a core issue for
political action. Hage states that a mental projection of the future is
necessary in order to take political action in the present: ideas of the
future are 'not just a conception of the world but an investment in it'
(2012, p. 291). [Games can productively contribute, as 'laboratories',
to the experimentation for the future by allowing us to think about
other times and places so that we might think politically about the
present. Games can contribute to this by allowing us to think,
experiment and reflect of different social orders that we might bring to
light.]{.underline} Games are not the only way that this could happen,
and building from Games of Empire, they have a unique capacity to help
think about life beyond Empire. Imagining Gaming in the Present Games of
Empire adds to the political analysis of gaming by establishing
connections between the internal narrative, subjective, aesthetic,
affective and ludic elements of a particular game with the conditions of
production, especially with regard to the labour of those who make the
game possible. The way that these conditions make games possible also
shapes what kind of possibilities we can imagine for the future. Within
this paradigm, Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter align individual video games
against two primary categories: games of multitude and games of empire,
with these terms drawn from the Empire trilogy. The two categories are
determined by what kind of future they permit, either a self-determining
alter-globalisation or a continuation of military imperialism. This is
the frame that Games of Empire takes: to understand how to locate games
within post-autonomist discourse. Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter fold the
questions of content and form together under a rubric of consumption and
production that pulls in the whole of the imperialist system. They note
how the conditions of game development are not separated from the
narratives, stories and futures that they produce: these very concerns
are built into and are expressed within production and consumption in
reciprocal ways. The conditions of these forms of labour are present in
the case study of 'EA Spouse' (2009, p. 59--65) through to the
extractive, slave-based labour necessary to obtain the coltan used in
console development (p. 222--224). [These examples take the hegemonic
impact of informational labour from simply being a top-down system as
Hardt and Negri propose, whereby intellectual labour shapes industrial
labour, which in turn shapes agricultural labour in a pyramidic
structure with intellectual labour at the peak]{.underline}.
Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter make clear that the nature of industrial
and extractive labour in itself shapes the conditions of intellectual
labour as well, influencing the stories and identities that games can
tell. As they state, \[Fictional\] subject positions may be utterly
fantastic, quite realistic, or somewhere in between. [But such in- game
identities are never entirely separated from the options provided by the
actual social formations in which the games are set, from which their
virtualities derive and into which they flow back]{.underline}. Game
virtualities remove us from, but also prepare us for, these actual
subject positions. Mostly, as we have discussed at length, they simulate
the normalized subjectivities of a global capitalist order -- consumer,
commander, commanded, cyborg, criminal -- not to mention the rapid
shedding and swapping between identities that is such an important
aptitude of workers (DyerWitheford & de Peuter, 2009, p. 192) It would
be a mistake to read the political value of the gaming avatar or a
gaming identity as allowing someone to 'live in another's shoes'. There
are numerous cases where games fail to achieve this because individual
lives, especially the lives marginalised people whose experiences are
'dipped into' temporarily, are always more complex than can be
represented in games, and the consequence is always more severe that can
be represented. From a political perspective, we can re-read the above
quote as suggesting that we take on others'subject positions not just to
work towards new social formations. We can take this further to critique
our current moment, addressing the forms of labour that define not just
game production but capitalism more generally. Histories of Future Games
There is a wealth of scholarship on the way that games allow us to think
across time, predominantly historical societies. This scholarship has
focused on historically themed games that allow us to think differently
about the past, in historical game studies. Games have a different
relationship to the representation of other times and places than other
media forms: Chapman, Foka, and Westin (2017) locate the work of
Uricchio (2005) as the starting point for the consideration of games as
presenting a medium-specific form of historicity. Uricchio focuses on
how historical research has often been shaped by the question of
mediation of particular histories, with a long history of media being
poorly received in the discipline (2005, p. 328). **[Historical games
enable a reinforcing or disruption of colonialist ideologies of the past
(Chapman et al. 2017, p. 415); Spring (2015) notes that games allow for
methods of representation that are not as available to other media
forms; Metzger and Paxton (2016) note that games allow a new kind of
interaction with the past. Postcolonial studies of gaming in particular
expose how games make alternative conceptions of history
possible]{.underline}**. The work of Souvik Mukherjee has explored cases
of what we might describe as 'alter-empire' in historical games (2016)
and also how we might frame the complexity of 'tourism' as resistant
historical subjects of imperial forces (2017, p. 59--62, p. 70--71).
Emil Lundedal Hammar has explored the complex relationship between
history, memory, individuality and race within a context of political
activism (2017) and in politically decontextualised revenge fantasies
(2020) in a way that addresses how contexts of other times and places
allow for playful reactions to political complications of the present.
The theme of interaction is one that Apperley (2013) and Chapman (2016)
both locate as being an important attribute of the way we think about
the past that games allow both a connection to history and a departure
from it, and through this, the rethinking of history becomes possible.
The flipside to the investigation of the past is those analyses that
explore a presentation of the future or at least 'a' future. **This
literature includes a focus on the aesthetics of the future and
alternative presents and also research into the way that some games that
frame their futures in procedurality allow for a type of emergent
future. Abraham and Jayemanne (2017) have called attention to the way
that games could aesthetically present a vision of a future of
ecological sustainability and survival for the planet, an approach that
Abraham deploys in the analysis of military shooters (2018).** My own
work has looked at the way that games allow people to rethink homes and
domestic economies through Dwarf Fortress (2006) and the homesteading
mechanic of many games (Fordyce, 2018). McClancy's (2018) analysis of
the Fallout franchise also exposes the concern around possible futures,
specifically noting that the narrative of the Fallout series is what
stakes a claim about how desirable any such future might be. Ruffino
(2019) has identified a strand of procedural games that mimic Franklin's
(1979) analysis of capitalist futures, specifically noting that
incremental games in particular offer a logic of infinite expansion and
that players respond by withdrawing from the prospect of an 'end'.
[Conversely, there is also scholarship that attempts to address the
nature of what survival itself might look like, post-capitalism, such as
van Ryn's (2020) account of survival without an economy of exchange in
Don't Starve (2013]{.underline}). **[There is also game scholarship that
takes the notion of utopia to task in itself, often framed around the
analysis of the Bioshock (2007) series. The Bioshock games focus on
intensified notions of political ideologies from the real world
hybridised with hyperbolic visions of capitalist consumption habits (see
Nyman & Teten, 2018; Perez-Latorre & Oliva, ´ 2017; Schulzke,
2014).]{.underline}** The only thing to be wary of is when our
imaginaries of the future are themselves stultifying and we are left
without energy or investment to move forward. This is one of the dangers
that the imaginaries presented in Bioshock truly risk that all futures
that diverge from centrism are awful, so any change is disastrous. The
same tools through which we reimagine the past can reimagine the future.
Reading Games Politically In 10 years, I have found only one quote by
Negri that is a sideline reference to video games. Squeezed between
complaints about broadcast TV and pop music, Negri states: 'Now,
television has become interactive, producing trash culture and
constructing an appropriate audience!' (Negri, 2007, p. 48). Yet, video
game experimentation can contribute to imagining past Empire; we can see
in games a space that allows exploration and experimentation of future
worlds. [A game can display a new economic arrangement, it can consider
alternative political configurations, it can enable experiments in
subjectivity and community and all of these attributes are important for
a political consideration of the future]{.underline}. While games do not
do this equally, all games can contribute something to these debates in
some respect. While the scholarship above has mostly focused on the role
of the action, rules, play and narrative, there remains space within the
autonomist tradition to consider games in terms of alternative
subjectivities for political action.

Empire appears in the form of a very high-tech machine: it is virtual,
built to control the marginal event, and organized to dominate and when
necessary intervene in the breakdowns of the system (in line with the
most advanced technologies of robotic production). (39) The imperial
order is formed not only on the basis of its powers of accumulation and
global extension, but also on the basis of its capacity to develop
itself more deeply, to be reborn, and to extend itself throughout the
biopolitical latticework of world society. (41) The empire\'s
institutional structure is like a software program that carries a virus
along with it, so that it is continually modulating and corrupting the
institutional forms around it. (197-98) This is the imperial Sprawl,
ruled not through decrees and armies (well, mostly not through armies)
but through communication/control networks that distribute virtual
power. This power is internalized by imperial citizens as surely as if
they had chips embedded in their brains. [[In Empire, subjectivity is
multicentered, produced through institutions that are terminally
unstable]{.mark}, always breaking down. [As]{.mark} the integrity of
[social institutions]{.mark} (such as schools, families, courts, and
prisons) fragments, [and]{.mark} the once-clear
[subject-positions]{.mark} associated with them [weaken]{.mark}, the
call for [imperial comprehensiveness is strengthened, inaugurating a
comprehensive]{.mark} ideology, a finely distributed pragmatic [myth of
networked, globally interlocking power]{.mark}. This is the
twenty-minutes-into-the-future of Philip K. Dick, J.G. Ballard, William
Gibson, Pat Cadigan, and Mamom Oshii, where computerized communications
operate 24/7, [generating a mindscape of consuming subjects]{.mark} into
which capitalist ideology feeds directly. [It]{.mark} perpetually breaks
down and reconstructs [human consciousness]{.mark}, as in a Cadigan
novel, [into provisional target-identities to which the]{.mark}
nostalgic, Utopian [dream of wholeness can be]{.mark} sold and [resold
perpetually]{.mark} in variant, sometimes mutually contradictory forms,
[and]{.mark} which can be [hired to convey its fictions of
sovereignty]{.mark} ever deeper [into the self that once
imagined]{.mark} it was [itself sovereign.]{.mark}]{.underline} In this
empire, there are infinite possibilities of projection, but only one
reality. [[The most natural thing]{.mark} in the world [is that the
world appears]{.mark} to be [politically united]{.mark}, that [the
market is global, and]{.mark} that [power is organized throughout its
universality]{.mark}.]{.underline} Imperial politics articulates being
in its global extension---a great sea that only the winds and the
current move. [[The neutralization of the transcendental imagination
is]{.mark} thus [the first sense in which the]{.mark} political in the
[imperial domain is ontological]{.mark}. (354) [Since contemporary
imperial power does not emanate from one center]{.mark}, but rather from
the cyberspatial ganglia of postmodern metropoli, [resistance manifests
itself in the daily refusal on the part of \"the multitude\" to follow
commands]{.mark}. For Hardt and Negri, [revolution is neither possible
nor desirable]{.mark}, since no class can act as the self-conscious
agent of history. [Freedom rests]{.mark}, as in Gibson\'s world, [in
finding one\'s own uses for things. In contrast with sabotage]{.mark},
the resistance strategy of national modernism, [resistance under Empire
consists of]{.mark} withdrawing consent, [of desertion]{.mark} (212).
[Even the greatest rebels are refuseniks, choosing to withdraw, leaving
behind]{.mark} them, like the fused AIs in Neuromancer (1984), [a world
in which \"things are things]{.mark}\" (270).]{.underline} Although this
strategy hardly promises much as a way of landing blows against the
empire, it is a dominant motif in the countercultural \"Lost in Space\"
(or alternatively, \"Lost in the Urban Labyrinth\") subgenre.
(Ironically, Lost in Space \[tv series, 1965-68; film 1998\] itself is
as hysterically conservative as Robinson Crusoe.) Where the overtly
imperial mode accepts the hierarchical network of
administration---Starfleet commanders still representing the
Federation---even mainstream popular works such as Farscape (1999-2003)
and Star Trek: Voyager (1995-2001) try to establish a de-centralized web
of relationships in the uncharted territories, now just a wormhole away
from the past (and the politics of empire).

### Alt -- Self-Security

#### The alternative is a form of self-security -- a bottom-up relationality that unsettles the securitized narratives in the postcolonial LIO. This allows us to imagine futures outside liberal institutions in a decolonial frame.

**[If the critique of the liberal peace project advanced here has any
credibility, a fundamental change is called for in our mode of thinking
about peacekeeping]{.underline}**. [As a rule of thumb, it might be said
that any postcolonial approach worthy of the name must go beyond
highlighting the shortcomings of the present system to showing how
things might be done differently]{.underline}. **[This is hardly
possible within the framework of liberal peacebuilding.]{.underline}**
It is hard to imagine how a postcolonial take could be given to what is
essentially a colonial undertaking. [For this reason, I advance some
thoughts about a preferred security schema within which an alternative
to peacekeeping could emerge -- rather than tinkering with the dominant
framework of thought that informs the making of policy]{.underline}.
**[Accordingly, this section will not take up issues such as
'institutionalization before liberalization'42 which leaves the
structure of the peacekeeping project intact, or localization through
regional bodies such the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
which remains an essentially top-down, state-centric
approach]{.underline}**.43 We might start with the increasing
recognition, even in international relations and other discourses of the
international, that to change the existing structure of things we need
to modify traditional scholarly procedures to bring out the
heterogeneity of knowledge and the messiness of its construction. The
Gulbenkian Commission on the Restructuring of Social Sciences stresses
that contemporary social science must break with mechanical models and
open itself to complexity, uncertainty and creativity.44 Robert Cox
argues similarly: social sciences should set aside the approaches of the
past that sought to define persisting structures and laws, and adopt
less deterministic approaches 'by being sensitive to emerging and
declining historical structures and movements of self-organisation in
social and political relations'.45 [Picking up on self-organization, it
is my argument that the most promising approach is assumed to be
anchored in the concept of self-securing.]{.underline} The idea of
securing the self dovetails nicely with postcolonial thought -- though
postcolonialism has no proprietary claim on it. It addresses several of
the lines of critique of the liberal peacekeeping project advanced
earlier in the essay. [Self-securing unsettles the understanding that
security is best handled from 'above', traditionally by the state and
now, quite often, by the state acting together with the United Nations.
Following the thrust of complexity theory, it challenges hierarchy,
centralization, linearity and separation (borders]{.underline}). **[It
would harness the social, so downgraded since the advent of
neoliberalism, and thereby make evident alternative ways of building
better relationships with others.]{.underline}** Of its very nature,
self-securing looks to the everyday. An archive needs to be developed on
neighbourhood and more dispersed practices of self-securing, the shaping
and use of public space to provide meeting places, and the role of
dissent as a form of community-building. Good use could be made of
documented cases of popular responses to natural disasters and financial
collapse in various parts of the world which show the capacity for
self-organization. In such ways, people who are mostly the objects of
security policies could be brought into the discourse: victims, the
poor, those in pain and suffering. Clearly, pursuing these ideas is a
research venture of a wide-ranging nature. One such project goes forward
under the aegis of the Institute of Postcolonial Studies in Melbourne;46
others are working on similar material, some in related fields.47 A
first step towards putting flesh on the bones of these arguments is to
examine the pre-colonial practices of non-European peoples which helped
regulate self --other relations. Frequently expressed in ritual,
ceremonial exchange, and gifting, they broaden our understanding of the
role of performance in the business of securing. This is not to
romanticize the past or to imagine that earlier practices could somehow
be transposed to the present, but rather to ask whether in modified form
they might have a contemporary relevance. [Account should also be taken
of the variety and ingenuity of the adaptation of nonEuropean concepts
and practices to the compulsions and inducements of the colonial
order.]{.underline} A particular significance attaches to the experience
of Aboriginal peoples, Karina Shaw has argued, because it provides a
microcosm of the struggles faced by a large percentage of the world's
population and is revealing of the character of modern politics.48
**[Then there is the rich tradition of alternative security practices
developed on the Indian subcontinent during the colonial struggle and,
on the diplomatic front, in the years immediately following
decolonization]{.underline}**. There is also a growing body of
contemporary work being done that takes its lead from complexity theory.
The study of networks is a case in point. It has not made much headway
in security studies except in relation to terrorist groups and criminal
networks trafficking in drugs, but it might yet. Indeed, it could serve
as a platform for putting security on a new footing. In other areas such
as cyberspace, globalization and new transnational actors, the network
metaphor and the relationality involved have figured large in debates
about the changing politics of the international. Despite its
association with postmodernity, Morgan Brigg points out that local
people in many parts of the world have long used notions of tangled
nets, and their untangling, as metaphors for managing and resolving
conflicts.49 For many years networks have also been central to attempts
to change the trajectory of development. In a classic article published
in 1992 which appears on every development reading guide -- or should --
Arturo Escobar wrote of networks as part of the submerged cultural
background from which social movements emerged. [Stressing the
centrality of everyday life to an understanding of social movements, he
went on to point to the transformative potential of such movements
because of their 'self-producing and self-organizing'
character]{.underline}.50 Escobar has recently returned to this theme,
showing how complexity theory and cyberspace strengthen the case for the
principle of self-organization being the way to a more equitable global
order.51 These last remarks lead into the question of how far the
development constituency -- or parts thereof -- might connect with a
revisioning of security along the lines we have been considering. Here I
am thinking not so much of development networks that might be expected
to be well disposed to self-organization in related fields, but to the
development community more generally. It has been argued in this essay
that NGOs have come to accept the close linkage between development and
security, thus falling into line with the prescriptions of states and
the World Bank. **[It has also been suggested that despite humanitarian
motivations the involvement of NGOs in the non-European world has often
functioned to legitimize the present international
system]{.underline}**. Tomohisa Hattoni has in fact argued that the
extension and acceptance of gifts is a mechanism of consent to the
capitalist order,52 and, moreover, that foreign aid works to confirm the
existing material hierarchies between North and South.53 Duffield's
argument should also be kept in mind that the NGO movement did not
expand politically by supporting peoples' struggles against imperial
domination or racial oppression but on the basis of emergency.54
Clearly, humanitarianism needs separate and sustained treatment, but the
humanitarian urge should not be discounted because it is tinged with
pragmatism and at times it is channelled to support unworthy causes. The
question for us is: how can it be better directed to advance
constructive social change? There is a strong case to be argued that
humanitarianism as it relates to development could be so redirected by
connecting with peacekeeping reconceived in terms of self-securing. If,
as policy-makers now insist, development and security go together,
recasting one should facilitate recasting the other. There is much in
the practice of development that stands in need of overhauling. For one
thing, less emphasis on immediate relief work and more on fostering self
reliance in the longer term. Almost certainly this would mean elevating
the social and downgrading the economic. Recently the renowned
development economist Kari Polanyi Levitt spoke of her commitment to
reclaim development, by which she meant 'the right of a society to
define its priorities on its own terms'.55 She went on: I used to make
complicated development plans. I don't really believe in that anymore. I
believe development has to do with how people relate to each other,
whether co-operatively and with synergy or competitively, with conflict.
The one will produce development, the other will produce chaos.56
Working along these lines would bring development into a parallel track
with the security agenda canvassed here. [Advocacy is another area that
could bring the reform agendas of development and security into a closer
relationship]{.underline}. It has been aptly said that NGOs have tended
to follow rather than lead public opinion. Nearly two decades ago, John
Clark declared that the challenge facing NGOs was to shift attention
from expanding their projects and increasing their turnover to
marshalling their influence to effect changes in 'attitudes,
institutions and policies'.57 That there has been so little change,
except in a few instances, must in large measure be attributed to the
reluctance to speak out for fear of losing state and World Bank project
money and putting at risk charitable and tax-deductability status. There
is also the belief that representations of starving people and, to take
a less common case, child sponsorship are more effective in bringing in
funds from the general public. Yet if NGOs remain more intent on toeing
the line with established authority and urging people to donate than to
thinking critically about development issues, the consequences are very
serious. The linkage between development and security provides a window
of opportunity for the NGO sector to strengthen its educational and
advocacy role. With established approaches to security increasingly in
question, the case for NGO activism is more persuasive than at any point
in the past three decades. This brings us to a point that I think has
been implicit in much of the argument of this paper. [Rather than being
regarded as a discrete field, perhaps peacekeeping should be understood
as but one of an ensemble of approaches to the problem of conflict,
sitting alongside not only development but international political
economy, world order studies, conflict resolution and
similar]{.underline}. [Peacekeeping might then become part of a
consortium that addresses conflict with an awareness of the need for
change in the structural relationship between North and South
(remembering that there is a North in the South and a South in the
North). I suggested above that peacekeeping needed to go out into the
world and connect with the everyday.]{.underline} It is increasingly
apparent -- if as yet insufficiently acted upon -- that in the South
this involves listening to and taking bearings from people outside what
is usually understood to be the formal political process. One thinks of
members of social movements, squatter communities or ordinary people
whose lives have been disrupted by violence: perhaps non-combatants
unable to live up to the model of masculinity into which they have been
socialized because they cannot provide for and protect their families;58
or women who find that the borders created by the state and the violence
that results are refracted in their family relationships.59 **[In many
situations, whether a peace can be made or maintained may depend more on
these grounded, personalized understandings -- experiential knowledge --
than on the geopolitical calculations and theoretical postulates of
those skilled in state-building and diplomatic
negotiation]{.underline}**. **[What is perhaps less appreciated is that
peacekeeping must connect with the everyday in the North as well as in
the South]{.underline}**. Over the past two decades various writers have
drawn attention to the culture of self-satisfaction that permeates
Western societies, which is often accompanied by a marked impatience
with the developing world and its problems.60 [Taking account of the
revival of interest in ideas about empire and the emergence of what has
been called the 'new racism', one might speak of a culture of insecurity
that drives forward the search for security in the formerly colonized
world]{.underline}. The contention is persuasive that, at least in part,
this insecurity goes back to imperial times.61 Now insecurity can be
politically enabling if it is channelled in such a way as to establish
commonalities with others.62 But it can also be very damaging if it is
harnessed to the pursuit of overbearing external policies -- as it
mostly is. Here it is worth recalling Slavoj Zˇ izˇek's point: 'ruling
ideas are never directly the ideas of the ruling class'.63 This is why
it is so important to engage with the culture of the everyday; it is
drawn upon selectively by the state to advance the interests of the
state and of those who manage the state. Surveying the experience of
peacekeeping and promoting development, it is striking that invariably
the problems are located 'out there' in the otherness of the
non-European world. Very seldom has analysis and prescription been
related back to the role of the First World and what could be done
within metropolitan societies or with regard to the structure of the
international system. One of the objects of studying other peoples and
cultures is surely to better understand ourselves, but it is not much in
evidence in the debates about peacekeeping. Somehow, it appears, the
discourse has failed to make significant use of knowledge about the part
the West has played -- and continues to play -- in creating instability
and insecurity in the Third World, together with widespread poverty.
Colonial rule deepened existing divisions in the non-European world; it
solidified religious and ethnic identifications; it eroded earlier ways
of managing conflict. After decolonization the ruling security and
development paradigms cut across the grain of politics as practised. [At
the same time, the structural violence of the leading powers and global
agencies ensured the continued subordination of the Third World to the
First.]{.underline} On a charitable reading, perhaps this was not so
much by design as by default. Knowledges that could have made a
difference were devalued or simply not taken up. On the first count,
there was the dismissal of much non-European knowledge -- as the World
Bank infamously declaimed: 'Poor countries -- and poor people -- differ
from rich ones not only because they have less capital but because they
have less knowledge'.64 On the second count, knowledge that is part of
the Western canon -- in imperial history, in postcolonial studies, in
international political economy and in international law -- was allowed
to remain in separate compartments. Thus deeply troubling aspects of the
politics of the First World were screened from view and
characterizations of the many 'lacks' of the other were given free rein.
The need now is to challenge conceptualizations of both violence and
underdevelopment as a problem embedded in the difference of the
non-European world. Or to put it another way, to carry out a spatial
reorientation, focusing for a bit on here and not there and showing how
'we' are heavily implicated in 'their' predicament. The question then
becomes: what can be done at home about fixing the processes of
international exchange to provide the conditions for self-reliance to
flourish?

### Alt -- Techno-Opacity

#### In response to the 1AC's call for transparency, the alternative is to embrace an algorithmic ethic of opacity as a precondition for political action. The alt is generative of ethical algorithmic governance.

**[Amid the widespread moral panic surrounding the black box of the
algorithm and the political demands for transparency, accountability,
and explainability, in this book I make a counter case for opacity and
the giving of partial accounts. I have argued that responsibility for
algorithmic decisions can never take the form of a clear-sighted account
of the action]{.underline}**. "Responsibility," as Thomas Keenan writes,
"is not a moment of security or cognitive certainty" in which one makes
a "choice between yes and no, this or that."26 [To establish a moment of
cognitive certainty regarding the algorithm---to demand its transparency
and accountability---is not at all the politics of a responsibility
worthy of the name]{.underline}. Indeed, with its new forms of cognitive
computing and cloud reasoning, as I discuss in chapter 1, the
contemporary algorithm is well attuned to generating clear-sighted
precise outputs from otherwise occluded situations. **[Contra the demand
for transparency, then, the opacity of the scene, and the undecidability
of its salient features and attributes, is the precondition for politics
and ethics. "What could responsibility mean," asks Keenan, "without the
risk of exposure to chance, without vulnerability," without the
undecidability of what is taking place in a scene]{.underline}**?27
Running against the grain of algorithmic logics that show, attend, and
tell the meaning of a situation, responsibility means that one cannot
see a clear path ahead because the meaning of the situation is
undecidable. The multiple branching points of the decision tree or
random forest algorithm do in fact carry the risk of exposure to chance
and vulnerability. **[A different kind of responsibility dwells at these
forks in the path, bearing the opacity of future consequences of the
weighting of one route over another]{.underline}**. In this book I
differentiate the search for an encoded ethical framework for algorithms
from an ethicopolitics that is already present within the algorithm's
arrangements. In so doing, I draw a distinction between a moral code of
prohibition and permission (what algorithms may or may not do) and an
ethics of the orientation one has to oneself and to others (how
algorithms are generating relations of self to self, and self to
others).28 This distinction follows Spinoza's broader philosophical
concern that "ethics has nothing to do with a morality."29 [Our
ethicopolitical relations do not follow strictly from some already
formulated moral code, for we never have the security of these grounds
from which to act. As Deleuze has reflected on Spinoza's ethics, "You do
not know beforehand what good or bad you are capable of; you do not know
beforehand what a body or a mind can do, in a given encounter, a given
arrangement, a given combination]{.underline}."30 Similarly, for
Isabelle Stengers, "every time we use the term 'ethics' we must
obviously distinguish it from the term 'morality,'" so that her
speculative ambition is ethical in the sense of ethos or habit.31
**[Just as Spinoza's ethics are ever in formation, forged through ethos,
encounters, arrangements, and combinations, so a cloud ethics is located
in the encounters, arrangements, and combinations through which the
algorithm is generated. Some of these encounters and arrangements
involve human beings; others are between unsupervised algorithms and a
corpus of data; and more still involve algorithms interacting with other
algorithms. This is an ethics, then, that puts into question the
authority of the knowing subject and opens onto the plural and
distributed forms of the writing of algorithms]{.underline}**.
Understood in this way, "ethics is able to exceed its traditional
determination" and be "displaced" and considered "anew" in the relations
forged with other beings.32 The possibility of what Derrida calls "the
opening of another ethics" is a different kind of opening to the
imagination of the prizing open of a black box or the illumination of a
dark calculus with moral oversight.33 It is an opening onto the edges
and limits of an iterative writing that is profoundly political, each
one of us drawn into the proximities of the output. Algorithms engage in
writing in and through their dense relations with people and things in a
data scene, their authorship uncertain and their emergence opaque.
[Here, in the opacity of not knowing in advance what the relations could
be, we have found an opening for taking responsibility]{.underline}. If
an ethical response to algorithmic decisions is to begin from opacity
and not from the demand for transparency, then what does this mean for
the strategies of a cloud ethics? [Where the political demands for
transparency reassert the objective vision of a disembodied observer, to
stay with opacity is to insist on the situated, embodied, and partial
perspective of all forms of scientific knowledge]{.underline}.34
Understood in Donna Haraway's terms, to confront opacity would not be a
matter of failing to open the black box or to see something, but rather
it would acknowledge that "the knowing self is partial in all its
guises," that practices of visuality necessarily enroll the opacity of
ourselves and others.35 Far from a lack of transparency limiting
accountability, the condition of opacity "allows us to become answerable
for what we learn how to see."36 This "we" who learns, as I discuss in
the machine learning practices of chapter 2, is a composite figure,
"stitched together imperfectly" from the iterative learning of humans
and machines.37 In the chapters of this book, I have been concerned to
show how machine learning algorithms generate their outputs through the
opaque relations of selves to selves, and selves to others, and how
these outputs then annul and disavow the opacity of their underlying
relations in the name of a crystalline clarity of the output. One mode
of resistance to the clarity of the algorithmic decision resides within
the opacity of the subjects and what cannot be known of their relations.
Let us consider a practical example of such a strategy. In the
experimental development of the neural networks for show, attend, and
tell, the algorithm designers explain that when their model makes a
mistake, they are able to "exploit" what it manifests to gain "intuition
into what the model saw."38 This kind of seeing on behalf of the
algorithm sustains the god's-eye vision of a computer scientist who may
redistribute their way of seeing at will. A cloud ethics can stay with
the difficulty of intuiting what the model saw as a form of partial,
situated, and locally specific account. Among the examples of the
mistakes used to productively generate new learning is "a woman holding
a clock in her hand" and "a man wearing a hat and a hat on a
skateboard." The algorithms have learned to recognize a clock and a hat,
even when these are absent in the scene, via their exposure to a corpus
of data that has supplied the feature vectors for these objects. The
algorithm's relations with a contingent and opaque set of multiple other
gradients have generated the mistaken presence of a clock and a hat
(figures 6.4 and 6.5). The cnns have generated an output of
attentiveness to the focus of the scene (shown in the images as an area
of white light)---this output itself contingent on millions of past
parameters---which enters the rnn as a data input. The rnn then
generates the "tell," or the natural language description of the scene,
assigning a probability for each word in the descriptor. In the
(mis)recognition of "A man is talking on his cell phone while another
man watches," the algorithm has assigned a probability of 1.00 (or a
certainty) to the indefinite article A, for example, but probabilities
of 0.46, 0.24, and 0.17 to the nouns man, cell, and phone. These
likelihood scores---low and yet apparently the most probable---are
entirely contingent on multiple algorithms' past relations with unknown
other scenes. As I explain in chapter 4, the mistaken recognition of the
algorithm is not merely error or errancy, for the output is entirely
reasonable given the algorithm's relations with a data world. In terms
of resistant practices, a cloud ethics is concerned not with fixing the
algorithm or eradicating its errancy, but rather with attending to how
these moments give accounts of algorithmic reason. What will take place
when the recognition of a clock that is not present becomes the
recognition of a weapon? What will be authorized by the most likely cell
phone that is an absent presence in the scene? To be clear, a cloud
ethics will point to the moments when partial and situated algorithmic
reason is sheltered as "mistake" or "error" and will reopen what is
incomputable in the making of a likelihood score. Such a strategy is not
the same as making a calculation transparent or accountable because it
recognizes that the 0.14 assigned to child or 0.46 and 0.37 to border
and fence are contingent on a vast multiplicity of necessarily opaque
relations between other people, algorithms, things, data, gradients,
features, and images. [When the algorithm "tells" us that this is what
matters in a scene, one could never have a transparent account of how
the story has been made tellable. Instead, there are only the
intransigent political relations that persist in the scene, the moments
of nonclosure that reopen the problem and the politics.]{.underline}

[Consider the most [radical]{.mark} and powerful [struggles]{.mark} of
the final years [of the twentieth century]{.mark}: the Tiananmen Square
events in 1989, the Intifada against Israeli state authority, the May
1992 revolt in Los Angeles, the uprising in Chiapas that began in 1994,
and the series of strikes that paralyzed France in December 1995, and
those that crippled South Korea in 1996. Each of these struggles
[was]{.mark} specific and [based on]{.mark} immediate [regional
concerns]{.mark} in such a way that they could in no respect be linked
together as a globally expanding chain of revolt. [None]{.mark} of these
events [inspired a cycle of struggles, because]{.mark} the desires and
needs they expressed could not be translated into different contexts. In
other words, (potential) [revolutionaries in other parts of the world
did not]{.mark} hear of the events in Beijing, Nablus, Los Angeles,
Chiapas, Paris, or Seoul and [immediately recognize them as their own
struggles]{.mark}. Furthermore, [these struggles]{.mark} not only fail
to communicate to other contexts but also [lack even a local
communication, and thus]{.mark} often have a very brief duration where
they are born, [burn]{.mark}ing [out in a flash]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This is certainly one of the central and most urgent political paradoxes
of our time: in our much celebrated age of communication, struggles have
become all but incommunicable. This paradox of incommunicability makes
it extremely difficult to grasp and express the new power posed by the
struggles that have emerged. [We ought to be able to recognize that
[what the struggles have lost in]{.mark} extension, [duration]{.mark},
and communicability [they have gained in intensity]{.mark}. We ought to
be able to recognize that [although]{.mark} all of [these struggles
focused on]{.mark} their own [local]{.mark} and immediate
[circumstances, they all]{.mark} nonetheless [posed problems of
supranational relevance]{.mark}, problems that are proper to the new
figure of imperial capitalist regulation.]{.underline} In Los Angeles,
for example, the riots were fueled by local racial antagonisms and
patterns of social and economic exclusion that are in many respects
particular to that (post-)urban territory, but the events were also
immediately catapulted to a general level insofar as they expressed a
refusal of the post-Fordist regime of social control. Like the Intifada
in certain respects, the Los Angeles riots demonstrated how the decline
of Fordist bargaining regimes and mechanisms of social mediation has
made the management of racially and socially diverse metropolitan
territories and populations so precarious. The looting of commodities
and burning of property were not just metaphors but the real global
condition of the mobility and volatility of post-Fordist social
mediations.14 In Chiapas, too, the insurrection focused primarily on
local concerns: problems of exclusion and lack of representation
specific to Mexican society and the Mexican state, which have also to a
limited degree long been common to the racial hierarchies throughout
much of Latin American. The Zapatista rebellion, however, was also
immediately a struggle against the social regime imposed by NAFTA and
more generally the systematic exclusion and subordination in the
regional construction of the world market.15 Finally, like those in
Seoul, the massive strikes in Paris and throughout France in late 1995
were aimed at specific local and national labor issues (such as
pensions, wages, and unemployment), but the struggle was also
immediately recognized as a clear contestation of the new social and
economic construction of Europe. The French strikes called above all for
a new notion of the public, a new construction of public space against
the neoliberal mechanisms of privatization that accompany more or less
everywhere the project of capitalist globalization.16 [Perhaps precisely
[because]{.mark} all [these struggles are]{.mark} incommunicable and
thus [blocked from traveling horizontally]{.mark} in the form of a
cycle, [they are forced instead to leap vertically]{.mark} and touch
immediately on the global level.]{.underline} We ought to be able to
recognize that this is not the appearance of a new cycle of
internationalist struggles, but rather the emergence of a new quality of
social movements. We ought to be able to recognize, in other words, the
fundamentally new characteristics these struggles all present, despite
their radical diversity. First, each struggle, though firmly rooted in
local conditions, leaps immediately to the global level and attacks the
imperial constitution in its generality. [Second, all [the struggles
destroy]{.mark} the traditional [distinction]{.mark} between economic
[and]{.mark} political struggles. The struggles [are at once economic,
political, and cultural---and hence]{.mark} they are
[biopolitical]{.mark} struggles, struggles over the form of
life.]{.underline} They are constituent struggles, creating new public
spaces and new forms of community. We ought to be able to recognize all
this, but it is not that easy. We must admit, in fact, that even when
trying to individuate the real novelty of these situations, we are
hampered by the nagging impression that these struggles are always
already old, outdated, and anachronistic. The struggles at Tiananmen
Square spoke a language of democracy that seemed long out of fashion;
the guitars, headbands, tents, and slogans all looked like a weak echo
of Berkeley in the 1960s. The Los Angeles riots, too, seemed like an
aftershock of the earthquake of racial conflicts that shook the United
States in the 1960s. The strikes in Paris and Seoul seemed to take us
back to the era of the mass factory worker, as if they were the last
gasp of a dying working class. All these struggles, which pose really
new elements, appear from the beginning to be already old and
outdated---precisely because they cannot communicate, because their
languages cannot be translated. The struggles do not communicate despite
their being hypermediatized, on television, the Internet, and every
other imaginable medium. Once again we are confronted by the paradox of
incommunicability. We can certainly recognize real obstacles that block
the communication of struggles. One such obstacle is the absence of a
recognition of a common enemy against which the struggles are directed.
[Beijing, Los Angeles, Nablus, Chiapas, Paris, Seoul: [the
situations]{.mark} all [seem]{.mark} utterly [particular, but in
fact]{.mark} they [all directly attack the global order of Empire and
seek a real alternative. Clarifying the nature of the common enemy
is]{.mark} thus [an essential]{.mark} political
[task]{.mark}.]{.underline} A second obstacle, which is really corollary
to the first, is that there is no common language of struggles that
could ''translate'' the particular language of each into a cosmopolitan
language. Struggles in other parts of the world and even our own
struggles seem to be written in an incomprehensible foreign language.
This too points toward an important political task: to construct a new
common language that facilitates communication, as the languages of
antiimperialism and proletarian internationalism did for the struggles
of a previous era. Perhaps this needs to be a new type of communication
that functions not on the basis of resemblances but on the basis of
differences: a communication of singularities. Recognizing a common
enemy and inventing a common language of struggles are certainly
important political tasks, and we will advance them as far as we can in
this book, but our intuition tells us that this line of analysis finally
fails to grasp the real potential presented by the new struggles. Our
intuition tells us, in other words, that the model of the horizontal
articulation of struggles in a cycle is no longer adequate for
recognizing the way in which contemporary struggles achieve global
significance. Such a model in fact blinds us to their real new
potential. Marx tried to understand the continuity of the cycle of
proletarian struggles that were emerging in nineteenth-century Europe in
terms of a mole and its subterranean tunnels. Marx's mole would surface
in times of open class conflict and then retreat underground again---not
to hibernate passively but to burrow its tunnels, moving along with the
times, pushing forward with history so that when the time was right
(1830, 1848, 1870), it would spring to the surface again. ''Well grubbed
old mole!'' 17 Well, we suspect that Marx's old mole has finally died.
It seems to us, in fact, that in the contemporary passage to Empire, the
structured tunnels of the mole have been replaced by the infinite
undulations of the snake.18 The depths of the modern world and its
subterranean passageways have in postmodernity all become superficial.
Today's struggles slither si-lently across these superficial, imperial
landscapes. [Perhaps [the incommunicability of struggles]{.mark}, the
lack of well-structured, communicating tunnels, [is]{.mark} in fact [a
strength]{.mark} rather than a weakness---a strength [because]{.mark}
all of [the movements are immediately subversive]{.mark} in themselves
and do not wait on any sort of external aid or extension to guarantee
their effectiveness. Perhaps [the more capital extends its global
networks]{.mark} of production and control, [the more powerful any
singular point of revolt can be. Simply by focusing their]{.mark} own
[powers]{.mark}, concentrating their energies in a tense and compact
coil, [these]{.mark} serpentine [struggles strike directly]{.mark} at
[the highest articulations of imperial order. Empire presents a
superficial world, the virtual center of which can be accessed
immediately from any point]{.mark} across the surface.]{.underline} If
these points were to constitute something like a new cycle of struggles,
it would be a cycle defined not by the communicative extension of the
struggles but rather by their singular emergence, by the intensity that
characterizes them one by one. [In short, this new phase is defined by
the fact that these [struggles do not link horizontally, but each one
leaps vertically, directly to the virtual center of
Empire.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Alt -- AT: Perm

\*Specifically, this evidence is super good at answering arguments along
the lines of "our unique impact scenario doesn't trigger/outweighs the
link" (i.e. perm double bind, perm do the alt in all other instances, or
extinction outweighs) -- also seems like it could be used as a framework
card, idk exactly how though

#### The final instance is never really the final instance -- Empire is constructed on the marginal event which guarantees its justification is effective and justified -- the sole exception of the AFF constitutes infinite further construction

What were traditionally called the royal prerogatives of sovereignty
seem in effect to be repeated and even substantially renewed in the
construction of Empire. If we were to remain within the conceptual
framework of classic domestic and international law, we might be tempted
to say that a supranational quasi-state is being formed. That does not
seem to us, however, an accurate characterization of the situation.
[When the [royal prerogatives]{.mark} of modern sovereignty reappear [in
Empire]{.mark}, they [take]{.mark} on [a]{.mark} completely [different
form]{.mark}. For example, the sovereign function of [deploying military
forces]{.mark} was carried out by the modern nation-states and [is now
conducted by Empire, but]{.mark}, as we have seen, [the justification
for such]{.mark} deployments [now rests on a state of permanent
exception]{.mark}, and the deployments themselves take the form of
police actions. Other royal prerogatives such as carrying out [justice
and]{.mark} imposing [taxes]{.mark} also [have the same]{.mark} kind of
[liminal existence]{.mark}.]{.underline} We have already discussed the
marginal position of judicial authority in the constitutive process of
Empire, and one could also argue that imposing taxes occupies a marginal
position in that it is increasingly linked to specific and local
urgencies. [In effect, one might say that the sovereignty of
[Empire]{.mark} itself [is realized at the margins]{.mark}, where
borders are flexible and identities are hybrid and fluid.]{.underline}
It would be difficult to say which is more important to Empire, the
center or the margins. In fact, center and margin seem continually to be
shifting positions, fleeing any determinate locations. We could even say
that the process itself is virtual and that its power resides in the
power of the virtual. [[One could]{.mark} nonetheless [object]{.mark} at
this point [that]{.mark} even while being virtual and acting at the
margins, [the process]{.mark} of constructing imperial sovereignty
[is]{.mark} in many respects [very real!]{.mark}]{.underline} We
certainly do not mean to deny that fact. [[Our claim]{.mark}, rather,
[is that we are dealing]{.mark} here [with a special kind of
sovereignty]{.mark}---[a discontinuous form]{.mark} of sovereignty
[that]{.mark} should be considered liminal or marginal insofar as it
[acts ''in the final instance]{.mark},'' a sovereignty that locates its
only point of reference in the definitive absoluteness of the power that
it can exercise. [Empire]{.mark} thus appears in the form of a very high
tech machine: it is virtual, [built to control the marginal event,
and]{.mark} organized to [dominate]{.mark} and when necessary intervene
in the [breakdowns of the system]{.mark} (in line with the most advanced
technologies of robotic production). [The]{.mark} virtuality and
[discontinuity]{.mark} of imperial sovereignty, however, [do not
minimize]{.mark} the effectiveness of [its force]{.mark}; on the
contrary, [those very characteristics]{.mark} serve to [reinforce its
apparatus]{.mark}, [demonstrating its effectiveness]{.mark} in the
contemporary historical context and its legitimate force [to resolve
world problems in the final instance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Alternative approach is the only way to break from the squo -- aff's reformism and lesser evil mentality forces binaries that prevent fundamental change

[Weizman, 2011.]{.underline} (Eyal, professor of spatial and visual
cultures at Goldsmiths University of London, founder of the collective

Possible Evils: Humanitarian Violence from Arendt to Gaza*. Verso
Publishers, Print copy, page 21-24)

Behind the present use of the term \'lesser evil\' is a rich history and
various intellectual trajectories. What may otherwise seem to be a
perennial problem, endemic to ethics and political practice, a dilemma
that recurs in different moments in time in the same shape and form,
might in fact reveal something peculiar about each moment and situation.
The various political, theological and philosophical uses of the lesser
evil idiom may suggest that it meant different things to different
people in different periods and situations. Every political tradition
and form of political practice developed its own ways of engaging with
the lesser evil argument - and much has subsequently been lost in
translation. For example, unlike the tradition of liberal ethics that
would invoke him centuries later, Augustine was never content with
lesser evils. Indeed, a significant aspect of the idea of the lesser
evil has been lost in its process of secularization from early Christian
theology into the utilitarian foundations of liberal ethics. For the
original Christian toleration of the lesser evil was understood in
relation to the telos of redemption that is ultimately in excess of all
calculations. For Augustine, the name for this state beyond calculations
was \'the kingdom of heaven\'. [In contrast to the teachings of the
Christian theologians that they invoked, and locked within a perpetual
economy of immanence, [liberal ethics can be interpreted as a drive for
the \'optimization\' of a system of government.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[But what is the sense in optimizing those regimes when they perpetuate
intolerable injustice?]{.mark} Even those of us without much use for a
\'kingdom of heaven\']{.underline} and without much patience for the
systems of pastoral government that should guide us to it, [can still
see in Augustine\'s argument [an important challenge: how to engage in
political practice within the complex]{.mark} existing [force-fields of
the present in a way that]{.mark} also [aims to break away from them?
This challenge is]{.mark} particularly [acute for those who operate
within]{.mark} or in relation to [situations they deem intolerable and
want to fundamentally change rather than reform]{.mark}. The practices
of human rights]{.underline} could be used as effective tools against
close societies and tyrannies, and were indeed often used in struggles
that ended up replacing those regimes, they [lend themselves easily for
manipulation in the context of liberal democracies.]{.underline} At
different times, Marx, Lenin, Kautski, Luxemburg, Trotsky and Gramsci
grappled with the problem of the lesser evil in fighting for gains here
and now, while also fighting for a different and better world on the
other. At various points they advocated struggles for immediate gains -
for example, proposing trade unions, whose function was to win a better
deal for workers in an exploitative system. None of them, however,
thought that trade unions were all that was possible, and none was
satisfied with simply winning a better deal within an existing system.
Unlike the revolutionary and militant communists who protested the drift
towards a timid, reformist politics of choosing the lesser evil and of
making compromises with capital[, Marx thought that winning a ten-hour
day was a considerable victory for the English proletariat]{.underline}.
Marx\'s argument shifted the attention from [the ten hours of work to
the fourteen hours of non-work time]{.underline}. These [he thought
provided the opportunity to build an organizational platform, as well as
the consciousness and experience needed to take over the means of
production.]{.underline} To show that it is futile to object to all
lesser evil compromises on principle, we could even enlist Lenin
himself. In his attempt to explain the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that lead
to Soviet Russia\'s exit from World War I in 1918 after making an
agreement with the western powers, Lenin returned to a scene of a road
robbery described by Augustine. \'To reject compromises \"on
principle\", to reject the permissibility of compromises in general, no
matter of what kind\', said Lenin, \'is childishness \... One must be
able to analyze the situation and the concrete conditions of each
compromise, or of each variety of compromise. One must learn to
distinguish between a man who has given up his money and firearms to
bandits so as to lessen the evil they can do and to facilitate their
capture and execution, and a man who gives his money and firearms to
bandits so as to share in the loot.\'34 The deliberation of a political
thought-practice must indeed insist on uncovering the force-field within
which each of the dilemmas of the lesser evil exists, seeking to
identify more extended and intricate political connections; looking
further into the future, it should insist on political goals and the
means of their achievement. At one end of the spectrum, in which the
lesser evil argument occupies the middle ground, stand those who believe
that every possible gain at present is insignificant in light of the
essentially compromised state of the world. Part of the structure of
this argument is found the principle of the politique du pire- the
politics of making things worse. This line of thought believes in the
redemptive potential of misery- or in its theological-political
incarnation as dolorism: pain as a spiritual experience that allows
people to see more clearly. Every form of improvement is necessarily
seen as the normalization of exploitation or the pacification of
injustice. Opting for the worst is, therefore, an attempt to undermine
the field of alternatives of a pre-given choice and overcome its terms.
[But [are the horrific spectacles of greater evils preferable to the
incremental damage of lesser ones?]{.mark} [Is the choice only between
squabbling with power about the correct measure of its violence, helping
to calibrate it]{.mark} and tend to its wounded, or on the other hand a
call for its amplification in order to \'expose its
contradictions\']{.underline} (contradictions seem only to sustain
power\'s march) [to shock a complacent population into rising
up?]{.underline} Between refusal and tactical embrace the difficulty of
the dilemma of the lesser evil is equally in practising and in avoiding
it. The Greeks thought of the dilemma as one of the elements of tragedy.
Each of the options that a tragic hero faces necessarily leads to
different forms of horrific suffering: [the dilemma was presented [as a
choice between the two horns of an angry bull.]{.mark} But [the options
must not only be about which of the horns to
choose]{.mark}.]{.underline} Robert Pirsig has suggested several ways to
subvert this complicity of the opposites: [[one can \'refuse to enter
the arena\', \'throw sand in the hull\'s eyes\', or \'sing the bull to
sleep\']{.mark}]{.underline} .35 [The [contemporary forms of
power]{.mark} unpacked in this book [are no longer so singular and
unified.]{.mark} Rather than a bull, [they may appear to take on the
shape of a multiplicity, a diffuse field of forces simultaneously
aggressive and benign.]{.mark} It is a form of power that not only
charges forward; it surrounds, immerses and embeds. [Political activists
must constantly invent new forms of struggle that are recognisant of
this paradigm of power, but which also evade and subvert its embrace,
attempt to rewire its webs in order to escape its
calculation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The characters that inhabit the
chapters of this book have stepped right into the thick of this web of
forces: their movement through them offer valuable examples and lessons.
Some paths must be avoided at all costs; others illuminate possible
courses of action within the intricate workings of the humanitarian
present.

# FRAMEWORK

### AT: Realism

#### Realism serves as a globalist framing to homogenize all experience to a western conception of the world \-- reject it 

[COLEBROOK 14]{.underline} (Clare Colebrook - cultural theorist,
currently appointed Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of English at
Pennsylvania State University. She has published numerous works on
Gilles Deleuze, visual art, poetry, queer theory, film studies,
contemporary literature, theory, cultural studies and visual culture)

[The word 'globalism' along with the word 'biopolitics' suffers from a
curious double valence. As a descriptive term globalism can refer to the
lost autonomy and destroyed difference among worlds: the formation of
global media, markets and communications eliminated what was once a
panorama of difference. Once upon a time the globe enjoyed divergent
timelines and worldviews. Even if it was central to the colonialist
imagination to romanticize the extent to which 'other' worlds were
exotically untranslatable, mystical and embedded in a non-linear time,
there is nevertheless a very real sense in which globalism has created
an earth of a single time, single market and single polity. Globalism
would be a mode of homogenization, disenchantment or rendering
quantifiable that one could lament as having displaced an earlier world
of distinct places for the sake of one quantifiable space. This
reduction of distinction has significant material consequences; today,
any particular country's environmental or wage policies will directly
alter the day to day life of bodies elsewhere on the globe.]{.underline}
But global inclusion and simultaneity also trigger a series of imaginary
ramifications. In positive terms this has been described by Michael
Hardt and Antonio Negri in terms of a new multitude. Liberated from
nation states and physical locales there can now be a humanity as such,
a self-creating living labor that has no body other than that which it
gives itself through its own immaterial productive powers (Hardt and
Negri 2004). Thought less optimistically, one might say that [the
physical ability to occupy converging and synchronized worlds and times
is coupled with a cognitive paralysis to think of any future that would
not be one more chapter in a familiar collective narrative. This is
evident in the terms that are used to describe the predicament of the
globe. It is not only the case that events are materially and
systemically linked, so that the volatile economies of even the smallest
countries may precipitate global crises; it is also typical today to see
all of financial history as similarly continuous and
interconnected.]{.underline} This occurs both in short-term and
long-term thinking; recent events have prompted the publication of a
series of histories and genealogies, including the histories of debt, of
money, of corporations, bonds and markets: all suggesting that the
present is an expression and extension of a single history of something
like 'the' globe (Ferguson 2008; Cashill 2010; Graeber 2011; Coggan
2012; Bakan 2005). Economic events are considered in relation to a past
that we have been unable to think as anything other than differing by
degree. [Despite the new global conditions and linkages the 2008 cascade
of economic crises were gauged to be either as bad as or worse than the
great depression, while terms such as 'recovery,' 'recession,'
'depression,' and 'crisis' place the current state of play as a
continuation of a past, a past that varies and recovers always in terms
of one easily comprehended cycle. The lexicon deployed to assess and
gauge the environment is similarly comforting in terms of its linear
temporality and delimitation: Australia still refers to its condition as
one of 'drought,' even when the period of insufficient rain and
increasing desertification exceeds a decade; climate change policy
refers to 'mitigation,' 'adaptation,' 'sustainability' and
'viability'---all of which enable one to think of management (however
difficult) rather than cessation, rupture or incomprehension. One might
say that the imaginary is, indeed, global. A literal globalism---the
stark reality of there being no escape, no outside, nowhere else to
flee]{.underline} now that the earth has been forced to yield ever more
to the human desire for life---is coupled with an incompatible global
figuration. Things will cycle back to recovery. The globe can be taken
and assessed as an object and managed, saved, revived or given the
respect and care that it deserves. If where we are is a globe, then it
can be imagined as delimited, bounded, organically self-referring and
unified.

### FW -- Epistemology First

#### Evaluate epistemology first -- Empire is constructed through various self-legitimating hegemonic discourses, but under each is an alternative ontology of liberation which can only be revealed through a priori deconstruction

**Hardt/Negri '2K** (Michael Hardt; professor of literature at Duke
University. Antonio Negri; independent researcher and philosopher,
previously a professor of political science at University of Padua.
"Empire" pg 46-49 2000) // ELog

The legacy of modernity is a legacy of fratricidal wars, devastating
''development,'' cruel ''civilization,'' and previously unimagined
violence. Erich Auerbach once wrote that tragedy is the only genre that
can properly claim realism in Western literature, and perhaps this is
true precisely because of the tragedy Western modernity has imposed on
the world.5 Concentration camps, nuclear weapons, genocidal wars,
slavery, apartheid: it is not difficult to enumerate the various scenes
of the tragedy. By insisting on the tragic character of modernity,
however, we certainly do not mean to follow the ''tragic'' philosophers
of Europe, from Schopenhauer to Heidegger, who turn these real
destructions into metaphysical narratives about the negativity of being,
as if these actual tragedies were merely an illusion, or rather as if
they were our ultimate destiny! Modern negativity is located not in any
transcendent realm but in the hard reality before us: the fields of
patriotic battles in the First and Second World Wars, from the killing
fields at Verdun to the Nazi furnaces and the swift annihilation of
thousands in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the carpet bombing of Vietnam and
Cambodia, the massacres from Se´tifand Soweto to Sabra and Shatila, and
the list goes on and on. There is no Job who can sustain such suffering!
(And anyone who starts compiling such a list quickly realizes how
inadequate it is to the quantity and quality of the tragedies.) Well, if
that modernity has come to an end, and if the modern nation-state that
served as the ineluctable condition for imperialist domination and
innumerable wars is disappearing from the world scene, then good
riddance! [[We must cleanse]{.mark} ourselves of any misplaced
[nostalgia for]{.mark} the belle e´poque of that [modernity. We cannot
be satisfied, however, with]{.mark} that political condemnation of
modern power that relies on the historia rerum gestarum, [the]{.mark}
objective [history]{.mark} we have [inherited. We need to
consider]{.mark} also the power of the res gestae, [the power of the
multitude to make history that]{.mark} continues and [is
reconfigured]{.mark} today [within Empire. It is a question of
transforming a necessity imposed on the multitude]{.mark}---a necessity
that was to a certain extent solicited by the multitude itself
throughout modernity as a line of flight from localized misery and
exploitation---[into a condition of possibility of liberation]{.mark}, a
new possibility on this new terrain of humanity. [This is when the
ontological drama begins]{.mark}, when the curtain goes up on a scene in
which the development of Empire becomes its own critique and its process
of construction becomes the process of its overturning. This drama is
[ontological in the sense that]{.mark} here, [in these processes, being
is produced and reproduced]{.mark}. This drama will have to be clarified
and articulated much further as our study proceeds, but we should insist
right from the outset [that this is not simply another variant of
dialectical enlightenment]{.mark}.]{.underline} We are not proposing the
umpteenth version of the inevitable passage through purgatory (here in
the guise of the new imperial machine) in order to offer a glimmer of
hope for radiant futures. We are not repeating the schema of an ideal
teleology that justifies any passage in the name of a promised end. [On
the contrary, [our reasoning]{.mark} here [is based on two
methodological approaches]{.mark} that are intended to be nondialectical
and absolutely immanent: [the first is critical and deconstructive,
aiming to subvert the hegemonic languages and social structures and
thereby reveal an alternative ontological basis]{.mark} that resides in
the creative and productive practices of the multitude; the second is
constructive and ethico-political, seeking to lead the processes of the
production of subjectivity toward the constitution of an effective
social, political alternative, a new constituent power.6]{.underline}
Our critical approach addresses the need for a real ideological and
material deconstruction of the imperial order. [In the postmodern world,
the ruling spectacle of [Empire is constructed through]{.mark} a variety
of [self-legitimating discourses]{.mark} and structures.]{.underline}
Long ago authors as diverse as Lenin, Horkheimer and Adorno, and Debord
recognized this spectacle as the destiny of triumphant capitalism.
Despite their important differences, such authors offer us real
anticipations of the path of capitalist development.7 [Our
[deconstruction]{.mark} of this spectacle cannot be textual alone, but
[must seek continually to focus]{.mark} its powers [on the nature of
events]{.mark} and the real determinations of the imperial processes [in
motion today]{.mark}. The critical approach is thus intended to bring to
light the contradictions, cycles, and crises of the process because [in
each of these moments the imagined necessity of the historical
development can open toward alternative
possibilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, the deconstruction
of the historia rerum gestarum, of the spectral reign of globalized
capitalism, reveals the possibility of alternative social organizations.
[[This is]{.mark} perhaps as far [as we can go with]{.mark} the
methodological scaffolding of a [critical and materialist
deconstructionism---but this is already an enormous
contribution!]{.mark}8]{.underline} This is where the first
methodological approach has to pass the baton to the second, the
constructive and ethico-political approach. Here we must delve into the
ontological substrate of the concrete alternatives continually pushed
forward by the res gestae, the subjective forces acting in the
historical context. What appears here is not a new rationality but a new
scenario of different rational acts---a horizon of activities,
resistances, wills, and desires that refuse the hegemonic order, propose
lines of flight, and forge alternative constitutive itineraries. This
real substrate, open to critique, revised by the ethico-political
approach, represents the real ontological referent of philosophy, or
really the field proper to a philosophy of liberation. This approach
breaks methodologically with every philosophy of history insofar as it
refuses any deterministic conception of historical development and any
''rational'' celebration of the result. It demonstrates, on the
contrary, how the historical event resides in potentiality. ''It is not
the two that recompose in one, but the one that opens into two,''
according to the beautiful anti-Confucian (and anti-Platonic) formula of
the Chinese revolutionaries.9 Philosophy is not the owl of Minerva that
takes flight after history has been realized in order to celebrate its
happy ending; rather, philosophy is subjective proposition, desire, and
praxis that are applied to the event.

### DA -- Militarism 

#### Militarism DA: the ideology of empire is not just within the military itself, but maintained through a subtler hum of the machine within education, making it a critical site for the resistance of imperialism.

After several years living abroad, I returned to Southern California in
late 2003. One afternoon, I was stuck in traffic behind a pickup truck
and seeing little else from my compact car but the back of the truck, a
black and white bumper sticker defiantly asked me, "Got War?" I stared
at that bumper sticker modeled after a 90s "Got Milk?" ad for the next
16 miles and thought of little else. Got War? I was curious, what is
this bumper sticker trying to tell me? What message is it trying to
send? Do we not already have war? Do we need war? The original milk
advertisement was silly, grown adults with childish milk mustaches
staring into the camera. Is war as frivolous as a milk mustache?
Something to be consumed and enjoyed? Something nostalgic even? This
bumper sticker was stuck to the back of that pickup truck at the height
of the Iraq War, and undoubtedly the USA was a nation at war, but then
as it is now, the USA is also a nation of war[. Hardt and Negri (2004)
argue that [we have entered an era of "perpetual war]{.mark}" where
militarized aggression and war are no longer the exception, but rather
the "normal state of affairs" (21). [The USA has engaged in]{.mark} some
type of [military action for over 80% of its]{.mark} total
[history]{.mark} (]{.underline}Torreon 2015). The USA is not only [the
largest global arms exporter]{.underline} (SIPRI 2016), but it also
[leads the world in military expenditures]{.underline} (\$596 billion in
2015); is responsible for [36% of the total world military
spending]{.underline} (Perlo-Freeman et al. 2016); and spends almost
[three times more than the next biggest spender]{.underline} China
(\$215 billion) B. Johnson (\*) Northeastern Illinois University,
Chicago, IL, USA 66 [and more than the next top seven countries
combined]{.underline} (Perlo-Freeman et al. 2016[). The US military
employs 3.5 million people and is the single largest employer of US
youth]{.underline} (Dickinson 2012) [and the single largest general
employer in the USA]{.underline} (Department of Defense 2014[) and
astoundingly the world]{.underline} (Taylor 2015). Such [[statistics are
easy to point out]{.mark},]{.underline} clear examples of the influence
and power of the US military globally and domestically, [but [what
**about the subtler, quieter hum of the military
machine**]{.mark}]{.underline}? Camouflage popping up in children's
clothing? Boot camp fitness classes at the gym? Humvees on grocery runs
in the suburbs? Retired military personnel [[running
schools?]{.underline}]{.mark} Flyovers at football games? "Got War?"
bumper stickers? [[The reach of military influence is vast and
varied]{.mark}, quietly **[infiltrating the minutia of our everyday
lives]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In fact[, the culture of]{.underline}
[militarism [seeps into so many different aspects of our lives that it
**is taken for granted**]{.mark} and largely unnoticed]{.underline}
(Finley 2012; Lutz 2012). The "step-by-step process by which a person or
a thinking gradually comes to be controlled by the military or comes to
depend for its well-being on militaristic ideas" is militarization
(Enloe 2000, 3). It is a process of aligning cultural, institutional,
economic, and social processes with militaristic values, beliefs, and
practices. The more inline a society is with militaristic values and
practices, the more accepted military action and the process of
militarization itself becomes to the point where militarization is
ordinary and even blandly normal (Enloe 2000). Militarization becomes as
normal as a milk mustache and as easy as attaching a "Got War?" tagline.
In a militarized society[, [a solution to any number of social problems
is militarized]{.mark} including inner-city [crime and violence,
troubled youth, national security]{.mark}, and even struggling [public
schools]{.mark}]{.underline}. Military personnel are [viewed as wielding
the smart weapons of discipline]{.underline} and leadership to right any
tilting ship. High-ranking military personnel are sent to negotiate
international alliances in place of seasoned diplomats. Bravery is not
diplomacy, compromise, or compassion, but martial aggression. Video
games, children's toys, films, and television programs glorify the
military and martial ideals, and militaristic violence is another form
of Friday night entertainment (Lenoir and Lowood 2000; Stahl 2010;
Vavrus 2013). [[Military recruiters freely roam the halls]{.mark} of
public schools]{.underline} argued to be important role models for "at
risk" youth (read working class or poor kids of color). For example, The
Troops to Teachers program pushes military personnel through the teacher
credentialing process placing these teachers in "high need" schools.
Military personnel are placed atop corporations and large organizations
regardless of experience or expertise.1 B. Johnson 67 Militarization is
more than just the dominance of military values across different aspects
of civil society; [[it is also nestled within social
inequalities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Domestic militarization is found in
[the [violence focused on and against people of color]{.mark}, such as
militarized policin]{.underline}g (Gilmore 2000). It is "seen in the
rise of the prison-industrial complex, the passing of retrograde
legislation that targets immigrants, the appearance of gated
communities, the widespread use of racial profiling by the police and
the ongoing attacks on the welfare state" (Giroux 2003, 39).
Militarization is situational and bound by social context[. The
[militarization of children is normalized]{.mark} within the
USA]{.underline} (JROTC and Boy and Girl Scout programs[), [but
criticized]{.mark} heavily [when it occurs abroad]{.mark}]{.underline},
especially in non-Western countries such as Somalia or Uganda (Macmillan
2011). The organized violence of military service by young people is
respected, valued, and constructed in direct opposition to the
disorganized violence of youth gangs or social justice groups---viewed
as dangerous especially if these groups comprise poor and working-class
youth of color (Basham 2011). But the militarization of public education
is complicated. On the one hand[, [schools in the USA are **locations of
intense militarization** pushing uncritical nationalism]{.mark} [and
blind obedience, both of which]{.mark} [buttress militarization and
permanent war]{.mark}]{.underline} (Elmore 2012). Schools are also
[[**one of the most important institutional sites** **for resistance of
militarization** and the simultaneous fostering of democracy as schools
can provide the necessary skills for a critically conscious citizenry.
It is important then to understand]{.mark} how **public [education is
militarized as well as how militarization can be and is
resisted]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This chapter focuses on the
justifications and implications of the militarization of public
education in the USA, specifically in the Kindergarten to 12th-grade
levels. There are two major periods of intensification of militarization
in public education. Militarization increased dramatically beginning in
the 1970s alongside the growing influence of neoliberalism and again
after the events of 9/11 as fear and disdain for critical inquiry and
dissent took hold of national subjectivity. This chapter illustrates how
militarization works in tandem with neoliberalism and a culture of fear
to discipline, control, and produce militarized consent through
education policies, programs, and institutions.

### DA -- War Games

#### War Games DA: the negative conception of debate as purely a game in which competitive incentives overdetermine knowledge production and sociality recreate conquest logics. They frame debate not as an academic space but as a game to be conquered, reducible to mere trophies and speaker points which reproduces the ideology of endless warfare.

### DA -- Martial Politics

#### Martial Politics DA: Academia is deeply intertwined with the logics of militarization. Their model of "switch side debate" and "predictability" isn't neutral but based in a fundamentally militarist starting point, and you should heavily err \[x\] on substance due to the bias of the university.

[Just as "[militarization]{.mark}" has guided inquiry into contemporary
police violence, it [has also been used to call attention to worrying
connections between the university and the US national security
apparatus]{.mark}.]{.underline} One prominent example is the series of
Vice News reports exposing the "100 Most Militarized Universities in
America" (Arkin and O'Brien 2015a, 2015b). The authors of the study note
that initially they were reluctant to use the term "militarization,"
which was not meant to simply evoke ... ROTC \[Reserve Officer Training
Corps\] drills held on a campus quad. It was also a measure of
university labs funded by US intelligence agencies, administrators with
strong ties to those same agencies, and, most importantly, the
educational backgrounds of the approximately 1.4 million people who hold
Top Secret clearance. (Arkin and O'Brien 2015a) But "militarization"
[[leads us to underestimate the depth and extent of national security
ties]{.mark} to the university, past and present, [and to assume that
universities can revert to some non-militarized
past]{.mark}.]{.underline} This limitation is also evident in scholarly
literature. One of the central scholarly texts on the so-called
"militarization" of the university is Giroux's The University in Chains
(2007). Cited hundreds of times, and reported on in popular media, it
argues that the post-9/11 period saw a significant acceleration of the
corporatization and militarization of the university (Giroux 2007,
2008). Giroux goes so far as to say that while corporatization had
previously taken root in the university, "it is only in the aftermath of
9/11 that the university has also become an intense site of
militarization" (Giroux 2008, 58). Furthermore, "militarization" of the
university begins for Giroux only after World War II (see also Chomsky
et al. 1998). These popular and scholarly works identify important
changes in the nature of military involvement in universities. For
example, the Vice report notes that funding now flows to
intelligence-gathering disciplines (e.g., computer science) rather than
solely weapons-oriented ones (e.g., physics). [Yet research guided by
the concept of "militarization" falls into the trap of imagining
military encroachment on previously civil institutions: "the idea of the
university as a site of critical thinking, public service and socially
responsible research appears to have been usurped" (Giroux 2008, 63).
This is a fantasy. **[The university was never such a pure site. Many
American universities were built with slave labor or its
proceeds]{.mark}** (Brown University Committee on Slavery and Justice
n.d.), and from the outset have [contributed vitally to colonization and
White supremacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} By positing a purely civilian
"before" to a military "after," "militarization" accounts wrongfully
elide this history. In the American university no such "before" exists.
This is not to say nothing has changed. [[Seeing the university as a
site of "martial politics" allows us to provide a historical account
attuned to the ways in which politics is shaped by the precise forms
warfare takes. Most academic disciplines -- the very categories by which
we organize knowledge -- were **fundamentally shaped by conquest,
warfare and military funding**]{.mark}. This is not only true for IR, a
discipline born out of colonialism and war (Vitalis 126 A. HOWELL 2015),
but for any number of other disciplines from physics (Gusterson 1998,
2011) to business (Cowen 2014) to neuroscience (Howell
2017).]{.underline} [Excavating these histories gives us a sense of how
thoroughly we live with "martial politics."]{.underline} Several
disciplines were said to have been "militarized" after 9/11. Most
controversially, medicine, psychiatry, psychology and anthropology all
had major debates about involvement in torture and warfare in their
professional associations. In anthropology, for example, this debate
concerned the 2008 establishment of Project Minerva (which provided \$50
million in defense funding to social sciences) and the recruitment of
anthropologists in counterinsurgency warfare through the Human Terrain
Program (Gusterson 2009). To describe this as the "militarization" of
anthropology, however, is to ignore that anthropology is foundationally
a colonial discipline set up to catalog "primitive" subject peoples,
with a long history of entanglement with the security state, not least
in Cold War-era counterinsurgency operations in Latin America and Asia
(Gusterson 2009). [[The concept of "martial politics" allows us to pose
new questions about]{.mark} the historical relationship [between
**formal knowledge production and forms of warfare**]{.mark}, rather
than just relations between the university and the
military.]{.underline} It allows us to ask how [certain forms of warfare
are produced by, and produce, academic disciplines. The nature of this
mutual production will differ depending on the particular military
strategy undertaken at any historical moment. The case of psychology is
instructive here. After psychologists were implicated in devising,
administering and overseeing torture at the US naval base at Guantánamo
Bay (Howell 2007), concern was raised about the "militarization" of
psychology]{.underline} (Ariggo, Eidelson, and Bennett 2012). Again,
this concern assumes that the discipline was once free from involvement
in war or colonialism, and that an unusual trespass occurred after 9/11.
Not so. [Since almost its very foundation, psychology has been tied to
forms of military strategy]{.underline}. In the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries, psychology was a fledgling discipline and was
understood as a humanistic form of knowledge. That changed drastically
in World War I. At that time Robert Yerkes, a eugenics proponent and
professor of psychology, was President of the American Psychological
Association. Convinced that psychologists could be of service in the
war, and that war could be useful to psychologists, Yerkes approached
the US Army with a proposition: he could help the Army with its
personnel problem (of appropriately placing the massive number of new
recruits) in return for funding and access to an unprecedented number of
subjects on which to experiment: soldiers. World War I enabled the first
mass scientific experiment in psychology in the form of intelligence
testing. The data accumulated provided fodder for a generation of
psychologists, establishing the experiment as the primary methodology of
psychology and massively reshaping the discipline from a
philosophical/humanistic one into an (American) science. This
constitutes a symbiotic relationship: psychology was not "militarized"
in World War I. Rather, it propelled a particular kind of warfare:
industrial warfare conducted on frontlines, involving mass mobilization
and requiring new personnel management techniques. Wartime support, in
return, worked to reshape psychology into a science. [[The **academy is
not the victim**]{.mark} of military breach [but has foundationally been
produced and formed, in its specificities, through warfare -- and has
formed warfare]{.mark} in return as a technology of security (Howell
2011)]{.underline}. Psychology was already well steeped in the racist
and ableist science of eugenics prior to World War I (Mitchell and
Snyder 2003; Carey 2009; Thomson 2010), but through military funding it
was able to systematize its eugenicism as a science of "intelligence."
This martial entanglement did not end with the war and the return of
psychology to "domestic" applications. Intelligence data not only
established psychology as a science but went on to practical
applications in war-like relations of disability and race both within
the US and other colonial settings. Three examples follow that
demonstrate this move. First, the data from the Army experiment produced
results that "proved" that the average American had the intelligence
level of a 13-year-old, just above the level of "moron" (an ableist
construct). This contributed to a moral panic about the degeneration of
the "stock" of the American nation due to Southern European immigrants,
and led to some of the first sweeping US immigration restrictions. It
also bolstered mental hygiene and eugenics movements, promoting the
sterilization of disabled, racialized, Indigenous or "promiscuous" women
who were labeled feeble-minded (Carey 2003). This form of martial
politics perpetrates violence especially on women's bodies, managing
their sexuality and reproductive capacities for the purposes of
extirpating "dangerous" or degenerate populations. Second, since they
were constructed by White men who saw "intelligence" in their own image,
the Army tests unsurprisingly placed the "negro" at the bottom of a
racist (and sexist) hierarchy of intelligence (Mensh and Mensh 1991;
Gould 1999). With their sheen of objective science, these very same Army
tests were administered in South Africa and other colonies, justifying
colonial rule and later Apartheid. Finally, Carl Brigham, who was part
of the Army experiment team, and later a Princeton University professor
and member of the advisory council of the American Eugenics Society,
went on to create the high school Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SATs). The
SATs remain the cornerstone of one of the most pernicious and racist
aspects of the Army tests' afterlife: standardized testing. This regime,
to this day, outrageously ranks African American students as having 128
A. HOWELL lower intelligence, or aptitude, significantly reducing access
to higher education and thus economic mobility. All this history, all
these contributions of the discipline of psychology to unjust dynamics
surrounding race, disability, poverty and gender, are shuttered by a
"militarization" framework because it assumes that when psychology is
used in war (e.g., in torture) that this is an aberration rather than
part of a broad history of violence done to marginalized people,
citizens and enemies alike. [In thinking through the "martial politics"
of the university, [any number of disciplines could be subjected to this
kind of analysis]{.mark}.]{.underline} Returning to Maneuvers, consider
the case of nursing, to which Enloe (2000) directs her attention in
assessing the "militarization" of women's lives. The chapter in question
perceptively begins with Florence Nightingale, who is widely considered
to be the "mother" of nursing, a pioneer in statistical visualization
and a major figure in the reform of public health and medical care in
both the Crimean War and Victorian workhouses. Yet Nightingale sits
uneasily in a framework that inquires into the "militarization" of
women's lives because, as Enloe (2000, 204) shows, as a patriotic
upper-class White English woman, she herself was active in propelling
"militarization." Because of its "militarization" framework, Enloe's
account misses the fact that warfare and nursing were both modernized
and professionalized through their mutual encounter. Nightingale's
innovations transformed siege warfare, helping ensure British victory in
the Crimea, and laid the foundations for World War I industrial warfare.
After Nightingale returned from the war she was instrumental in creating
nursing as a profession and discipline of study, using techniques
developed for military purposes in "domestic" settings such as
workhouses. The story here is not one of military encroachment on
nursing; rather, nursing became a discipline and profession initially
through war, and subsequently through war-like relations with the poor.
This symbiosis between war and academic disciplines such as nursing,
psychology and -- for that matter -- IR should make it unsurprising when
war-like relations are propelled through knowledge created in these
disciplines. When we view academic disciplines, or indeed the university
as a whole, through the lens of "martial politics" it becomes clear they
are not innocent domains sullied by military values. Rather, like the
can of soup, their form and function are embedded in how they emerge out
of and simultaneously shape warfare. Even when "militarization" accounts
are historical[, they lead us to misconstrue the importance and nature
of that history. When there is violence in domestic political life --
whether the outright violence of killer cops or the structural violence
of the SATs -- [it is not that "war" is encroaching on "peace," and it
is not that "the military" is trespassing on the "civilian." Rather,
"martial politics" are fundamental to the constitution and continued
production of liberal democracies such as the US. This is not directed
equally at all parts of the population but targets those **who are
constituted as a threat to the nation's strength or civil
order.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The debate on empire is back. [This is not surprising, as the United
States dominates the world as no state ever has.]{.underline} It emerged
from the Cold War the only superpower, and no geopolitical or
ideological contenders are in sight. Europe is drawn inward, and Japan
is stagnant. A half century after their occupation, the United States
still provides security for Japan and Germany-the world\'s second- and
third-largest economies. U.S. military bases and carrier battle groups
ring the world. Russia is in a quasi-formal security partnership with
the United States, and China has accommodated itself to U.S. dominance,
at least for the moment. For the first time in the modern era, the
world\'s most powerful state can operate on the global stage without the
constraints of other great powers. We have entered the American unipolar
age. The Bush administration\'s war on terrorism, invasions of
Afghanistan and Iraq, expanded military budget, and controversial 2002
National Security Strategy have thrust American power into the light of
day-and, in doing so, deeply unsettled much of the world. Worry about
the implications of American uni polarity is the not-so-hidden subtext
of recent U.S.-European tension and has figured prominently in recent
presidential elections in Germany, Brazil, and South Korea. The most
fundamental questions about the nature of global politics-who commands
and who benefits-are now the subject of conversation among long-time
allies and adversaries alike. Power is often muted or disguised, but
when it is exposed and perceived as domination, it inevitably invites
response. One recalls the comment of Georges Clemenceau, who as a young
politician said of the settlement ending the Franco Prussian War,
\"Germany believes that the logic of her victory means domination, while
we do not believe that the logic of our defeat is serfdom.\" At
Versailles a half-century later, he would impose just as harsh a peace
on a defeated Germany. The current debate over empire is an attempt to
make sense of the new uni polar reality. The assertion that the United
States is bent on empire is, of course, not new. The British writer and
labor politician Harold Laski evoked the looming Amer ican empire in
1947 when he said that \"America bestrides the world like a colossus;
neither Rome at the height of its power nor Great Britain in the period
of economic supremacy enjoyed an influence so direct, so profound, or so
pervasive\....\" And in deed, Dean Acheson and other architects of the
postwar order were great admirers of the British Empire. Later, during
the Vietnam War, left-wing thinkers and revisionist historians traced
the same deep-rooted impulse toward militarism and empire through the
history of U.S. foreign policy. The dean of this school, William
Appleton Williams, argued in The Tragedy of American Diplomacy that the
nation\'s genuine idealism had been subverted by the imperial pursuit of
power and capitalist greed. Today, the \"American empire\" is a term of
approval and optimism for some and disparagement and danger for others.
[Neoconservatives celebrate the imperial exercise of U.S. power, which,
in a modern version of Rudyard Kipling\'s \"white man\'s burden,\" is a
liberal force that promotes democracy and undercuts tyranny, terrorism,
military aggression, and weapons proliferation.]{.underline} Critics who
identify an emerging American empire, meanwhile, worry about its
unacceptable financial costs, its corrosive effect on democracy, and the
threat it poses to the institutions and alliances that have secured U.S.
national interests since World War II. THE \"E\" WORD No one disagrees
that U.S. power is extraordinary. It is the character and logic of U.S.
domination that is at issue in the debate over empire. [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is not just]{.mark} [a superpower
pursuing its interest; it is a producer of world
order.]{.mark}]{.underline} Over the decades-with more support than
resistance from other nations-it has fashioned a distinctively open and
rule-based international order. Its dynamic bundle of oversized
capacities, interests, and ideals constitutes an \"American project\"
with unprecedented global reach. For better or worse, other states must
come to terms with or work around this protean order. [Scholars often
characterize international relations as the interaction of sovereign
states in an anarchic world.]{.underline} In the classic Westphalian
world order, states hold a monopoly on the use of force in their own
territory while order at the international level is maintained through
the diffusion of power among states. [[Today\'s unipolar world turns the
Westphalian image on its head.]{.underline}]{.mark} The United States
possesses a near-monopoly on the use of force internationally; on the
domestic level, meanwhile, the institutions and behaviors of states are
increasingly open to global-that is, American-scrutiny. Since September
11th, the Bush administration\'s assertion of \"contingent sovereignty\"
and the right of preemption have made this transformation abundantly
clear. [[The rise of unipolarity and the simultaneous unbundling of
state sovereignty is a new and volatile brew. But is the
resulting]{.mark} political [formation an empire]{.mark}? And if so,
will the American empire suffer the fate of great empires of the past:
ravaging the world with its ambitions and excesses until overextension,
miscalculation, and mounting opposition hasten its
collapse?]{.underline} The term \"empire\" refers to the political
control by a dominant country of the domestic and foreign policies of
weaker countries. The European colonial empires of the late nineteenth
century were the most direct, formal kind. The Soviet \"sphere of
influence\" in Eastern Europe entailed an equally coercive but less
direct form of control. The British Empire included both direct colonial
rule and \"informal empire.\" If empire is defined loosely, as a
hierarchical system of political relationships in which the most
powerful state exercises decisive influence, then the United States
today indeed qualifies. [[If the United States is an empire]{.mark}, how
ever, [it is like no other before it]{.mark}. To be sure, it has a long
tradition of pursuing crude imperial policies, most notably in Latin
America and the Middle East. But for most countries, the [U.S.-led order
is a negotiated system wherein the United States has sought
participation by other states on terms that are mutually agreeable. This
is true in three respects]{.mark}. First, [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has provided public goods particularly the extension of
security and the support for an open trade regime in exchange for the
cooperation of other states. Second, power in the U.S. system is
exercised through rules and institutions]{.mark}; power politics still
exist, but [arbitrary]{.mark} and indiscriminate [power is reigned
in]{.mark}. Finally, weaker [states]{.mark} in the U.S.-led order [are
given]{.mark} \"voice opportunities\"-[informal access to the
policymaking processes of the United States and the intergovernmental
institutions that make up the international system.]{.mark}]{.underline}
It is these features of the post-194S international order that have led
historians such as Charles Maier to talk about a \"consensual empire\"
and Geir Lundestad to talk about an \"empire of invitation.\" The
American order is hierarchical and ultimately sustained by economic and
military power, but it is put at the service of an expanding system of
democracy and capitalism.Fundamentally, then, the debate over the new
American empire hinges on how extensive and deeply rooted these
characteristics are-and whether its assertion of power since September
11 constitutes a fundamental break with this liberal past. THE GLOBAL
RACKET In The Sorrows of Empire, Chalmers Johnson advances the
disturbing claim that the United States\' Cold War-era military power
and far-flung base system have, in the last decade, been consolidated in
a new form of global imperial rule. The United States, according to
Johnson has become \"a military juggernaut intent on world domination.\"
Driven by a triumphalist ideology, an exaggerated sense of threats, and
a self serving military-industrial complex, this juggernaut is
tightening its grip on much of the world. The Pentagon has replaced the
State Department as the primary shaper of foreign policy. Military
commanders in regional headquarters are modern-day proconsuls,
warrior-diplomats who direct the United States\' imperial reach. Johnson
fears that this military empire will corrode democracy, bankrupt the
nation, spark opposition, and ultimately end in a Soviet-style collapse.
In this rendering, the American military empire is a novel form of
domination. Johnson describes it as an \"international protection
racket: mutual defense treaties, military advisory groups, and military
forces stationed in foreign countries to \'defend\' against often poorly
defined, overblown, or nonexistent threats.\" These arrangements create
\"satellites\"-Ostensibly independent countries whose foreign relations
revolve around the imperial state. Johnson argues that this variety of
empire was pioneered during the Cold War by the Soviet Union in Eastern
Europe and the United States in East Asia. Great empires of the past-the
Romans and the Han Dynasty Chinese-ruled their domains with permanent
military encampments that garrisoned conquered territory. The American
empire is innovative because it is not based on the acquisition of
territory; it is an empire of bases. Johnson\'s previous polemic,
Blowback, asserted that post-1945 U.S. spheres of influence in East Asia
and Latin America were as coercive and exploitative as their Soviet
counterparts. The Sorrows of Empire continues this dubious line. Echoing
1960s revisionism, Johnson asserts that the United States\' Cold War
security system of alliances and bases was built on manufactured threats
and driven by expansionary impulses. The United States was not acting in
its own defense; it was exploiting opportunities to build an empire. The
Soviet Union and the United States, according to this argument, were
more alike than different: both militarized their societies and foreign
policies and expanded outward, establishing imperial rule through \"hub
and spoke\" systems of client states and political dependencies. In
Johnson\'s view, the end of the Cold War represented both an opportunity
and a crisis for U.S. global rule-an opportunity because the Soviet
sphere of influence was now open for imperial expansion, a crisis
because the fall of the Soviet Union ended the justification for the
global system of naval bases, airfields, army garrisons, espionage
listening posts, and strategic enclaves. Only with the terrorist attacks
of September 11th was this crisis resolved. Bush suddenly had an excuse
to expand U.S. military domination. September 11 also allowed the United
States to remove the fig leaf of alliance partnership. Washington could
now disentangle itself from international commitments, treaties, and law
and launch direct imperial rule. Unfortunately, [Johnson offers no
coherent theory of why the United States seeks empire. At one point, he
suggests that the American military empire is founded on \"a vast
complex of interests, commitments, and projects.\" The empire of bases
has become institutionalized in the military establishment and has taken
on a life of its own. There is no discussion, however, of the forces
within U.S. politics that resist or reject empire. As a result, Johnson
finds imperialism everywhere and in everything the United States does,
in its embrace of open markets and global economic integration as much
as in its pursuit of narrow economic gains. Johnson also offers little
beyond passing mention about the societies presumed to be under
Washington\'s thumb. Domination and exploitation are, of course, not
always self-evident. Military pacts and security partnerships are
clearly part of the structure of U.S. global power, and they often rein
force fragile and corrupt governments in order to project U.S.
influence. But countries can also use security ties with the United
States to their own advantage. Japan may be a subordinate security part
ner, but the U.S.-Japan alliance also allows Tokyo to forgo a costly
buildup of military capacity that would destabilize East Asia.
[Moreover, countries do have other options: they can, and often do,
escape U.S. domination]{.mark} simply [by asking the United States to
leave. The Philippines did so, and South Korea may be next.]{.mark} The
variety and complexity of U.S. security ties with other states makes
Johnson\'s simplistic view of military hegemony misleading. In fact, the
U.S. alliance system remarkably intact after half a century-has helped
create a stable, open political space. Cooperative [security]{.mark} is
not just an instrument of U.S. domination; it [is]{.mark} also [a tool
of political architecture]{.mark}.]{.underline} But Johnson neglects the
broader complex of U.S.-supported multilateral rules and institutions
that give depth and complexity to the international order. Ultimately,
it is not clear what the United States could do-short of retreating into
its borders or ceasing to exist-that would save it from Johnson\'s
condemnation. PAX AMERICANA In Colossus, Niall Ferguson argues that the
United States is indeed an empire and has been for a long time. To
Ferguson, however, it is a liberal empire that upholds rules and
institutions and underwrites public goods by maintaining peace, ensuring
freedom of the seas and skies, and managing a system of international
trade and finance. The United States is the imperfect but natural
inheritor of the British system of global governance; it is open and
integrative and inclined toward informal rule. Accordingly, Ferguson\'s
worry is not that the world will get too much American empire but that
it will not get enough. U.S. leaders, for all their benign intent, have
unusually short attention spans and tend to go \"wobbly.\" In
Ferguson\'s view, the United States shares many characteristics with
past empires. Like Rome, it has remarkably open citizenship. \"Purple
Hearts and U.S. citizenship were conferred simultaneously on a number of
the soldiers serving in Iraq last year, just as service in the legions
was once a route to becoming a civis romanus,\" Ferguson writes.
\"Indeed, with the classical architecture of its capital and the
republican structure of its constitution, the United States is perhaps
more like a \'new Rome\' than any previous empire-albeit a Rome in which
the Senate has thus far retained its grip on would-be emperors.\" The
spread of America\'s language, ideas, and culture also invites
comparison to Rome at its zenith. But Ferguson is even more taken by
parallels with the British Empire. U.S. presidents, from Woodrow Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton,
and George W. Bush, have put their power work promoting the great
liberal ideals of economic openness, democracy, limited government,
human dignity, and the rule of law-a \"strategy of openness\" that is
remarkably similar, Ferguson argues, to the aspirations of the British
Empire in the second half of the nineteenth century. After all, it was a
young Winston Churchill who argued that the aim of British imperialism
was to \"give peace to warring tribes, to administer justice where all
was violence, to strike the chains off the slave, to draw the richness
from the soil, to place the earliest seeds of commerce and learning, to
increase in whole peoples their capacities for pleasure and diminish
their chances of pain\.... \" Most of Colossus retells the familiar
story of the rise of U.S. global dominance as an exercise in liberal
empire. What is distinctive about American imperialism, according to
Ferguson, is that it has been pursued in the name of anti-imperialism.
For each phase of U.S. history, Ferguson nicely illuminates the tensions
between republican ideals and the exercise of global power and shows how
those tensions are often resolved. The Cold War-and George Kennan\'s
doctrine of containment-provides the ultimate example of this fusion of
anti-imperialism and hard power. Security, openness, democratic
community, political commitment, and the mobilization of U.S. power went
together. The core of U.S. global rule involved the enforcement of rules
of economic openness, but the United States was also willing to act
forcefully to integrate countries into the liberal order. [Ferguson\'s
most interesting claim is that the world needs more of this liberal
American empire. This argument stems in part from the uncontroversial
claim that the current international order needs enlightened leadership
and that only Washington can provide it.]{.underline} (Ferguson holds
little hope that Europe will ever overcome its preoccupation with the
internal contradictions of its enlargement.) It is especially the wider
system of sovereign but failed states that needs imperial supervision by
Washington. In vast swatches of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East
national self determination has led to much grief. Ferguson argues
without qualification that \"the experiment with political
independence-especially in Africa-has been a disaster for most poor
countries.\" To Ferguson, the extension of liberal empire into these
regions (even involving some form of colonial rule) is necessary. What
precisely these imperial arrangements would look like, however, remains
unclear. When Ferguson says that he is \"fundamentally in favor of
empire,\" he is to some extent pulling a conceptual sleight of hand.
What Ferguson means by \"liberal empire\" scholars have previously
called \"liberal hegemony\": a hierarchical order that is still very
different from traditional forms of empire. By virtue of its power, the
liberal hegemon can act on its long-term interests rather than squabble
over short-term gains with other states; it can identify its own
national interests with the openness and stability of the larger system.
The United States thus shapes and dominates the international order
while guaranteeing a flow of benefits to other governments that earns
their acquiescence. In contrast to empire, this negotiated order depends
on agreement over the rules of the system between the leading state and
everyone else. In this way, the norms and institutions that have
developed around U.S. hegemony both limit the actual coercive exercise
of U.S. power and draw other states into the management of the system.
Ferguson\'s case for the virtues of American empire hinges on his claim
that in the aftermath of the Soviet Union\'s collapse, the world could
have gone one of two ways: international order organized around
independent nations or an American imperium. He maintains that a world
of decentralized, competing states, many of which are not democracies,
would result in chaos. This may be true; he is certainly right that
stability and open markets are not easily sustained without the support
of powerful states. [But [the notion of liberal empire conflates very
different types of U.S.-led order. One in which Washington coerces other
states into obedience is very different from a system of multilateral
rules and close partnerships]{.mark}. The [challenges of peace and
economic development]{.mark} that Ferguson identifies [are best pursued
by advanced democracies working together]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Ultimately, such a cooperative order would require that Washington
transcend the atavistic habits of empire rather than pursue a more
complete realization of it. In the end, Ferguson finds invoking the
image of empire useful for political reasons. Unlike the British,
Americans do not believe that they operate an empire. As a result, the
United States makes a flighty and impatient imperial power (in contrast
to the British, who acquired a cultural mentality for global rule).
Ferguson thinks that speaking honestly about the reality of American
empire will foster understanding of its duties and obligations. Yet
precisely the opposite is true. The United States does not need to view
the world as its Raj and deploy a colonial service to the vast
periphery; it needs to find ways to exercise its power in sustained,
legitimate ways, working with others and developing more complex forms
of cooperative international governance. It is also extremely doubtful
that the American people would accept such a massive imperial
undertaking: last September, as soon as President Bush revealed the
price tag for occupying Iraq, public support plummeted immediately.

### Thesis -- Empire = Wrong

#### Empire fails to account for 9/11 and events afterwards, making it useless in a contemporary context.

Are We All New Yorkers? [It is [ironic for Empire]{.mark} readers
[that]{.mark} the horror of [9-11 happened in the centre of the
empire]{.mark} so vividly [portrayed]{.mark} in that book.]{.underline}
The Twin Towers symbolised everything Empire discussed. From the
earth-encompassing power of finance capital, to internet capitalism's
connection and compression of space and time, and to the cosmopolitan
nature of the workers there, the towers were the epitome of everything
Empire loved and hated about the world today. Antonio Negri said 'we are
all New Yorkers' in an interview after 9-11 (Cocco and Lazarrato 2002)
and it is clear that the book he and Michael Hardt produced really does
see the whole world as if it was New York. [[For Hardt and Negri, the
global 'multitude' is composed of]{.mark} urban (and urbane)
[citizens]{.mark} whose autonomy and hybridity make institutions such as
states, and ideologies such as religions, evaporate into the mists of
the immaterial labour that now drive the world. The multitude's labour
is impossible to measure, so all of its members have equal value (cf.
Resnick and Wolff 2001; Dyer-Witherford 2001) [and they all really want
the same thing]{.mark}. Be they waiters in the Greenwich Village cafés,
analysts for the currency speculators on Wall Street, or professors at
Columbia University -- or at similar sites in New York's image anywhere
in the world [-- sometime soon they will all oppose capitalist
exploitation and national oppression, replacing them with the joys of
being a communist]{.mark}]{.underline}. The kind of resistance that
brought the Twin Towers down, however, forces the irony to take an
awkward and bitter twist[. [Al-Queda hardly represents the postmodern
enemies of post-imperialism]{.mark} envisaged (for the most part) in
Empire. [Empire's sweep is so vast and so fast that]{.mark} religion,
nationalism and any of the other [forces inspiring]{.mark} Osama
[bin-Laden]{.mark} and his many followers [are in the
dustbin]{.mark}.]{.underline} When these forces revisit the postmodern
world their aspirations are 'incommunicable' (Hardt and Negri 2000, 54,
Hardt and Negri 2001a; Negri 2002): it is as if they have arisen from
the dead. Contrary to Empire, however, they dealt New York and -- more
importantly but also almost erased from the book -- the state within
which the city is ensconced a blow that catalysed a form of empire Hardt
and Negri thought had disappeared. A 'one state beats all' form of
imperial power has arisen from the ashes of Twin Towers. It is now
wreaking terror in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq and chilling the
hearts of European politicians and United Nations multilateralists --
and it inspired 15 million members of the 'multitude' to demonstrate.
[But the [people who guided]{.mark} their passenger-packed [planes into
the Twin Towers were not]{.mark} 'New Yorkers' [in]{.mark} the mold of
[Hardt and Negri's multitude. Nor were]{.mark} most of [those]{.mark} in
Iraq [on whom bombs rained]{.mark} and American troops shot in March and
April 2003. [Neither are the Americans who supported the
campaign]{.mark}. The [actions, beliefs and structures]{.mark} of the
world in the [post 9-11]{.mark} era [are significantly different
from]{.mark} those inscribed in Hardt and Negri's [Empire]{.mark} -- as
is the etiology of the event.]{.underline} There are three ways to
assess Empire's inability to foresee the world in the wake of 9-11. I
list and analyse them in reverse order of theoretical priority
(indicated in the abstract) because the spectacle of such an event as
9-11 demands that in this instance the 'epiphenomenal' comes first
(Campbell 2001). Firstly, the act of terrorism that destroyed the Twin
Towers and killed the approximately 3,000 people within it must be
analysed in terms of the way in which Hardt and Negri understand the
nature of resistance to global capitalism (or, in their lexicon, 'the
informational mode of production'). Their uncertainty about the agents
and strategies of resistance lends ambiguity to their thinking about
9-11 and similar events. Secondly, the importance of the 'state' as a
structure within both core and peripheral components of global society
must be re-stated and theorised in the light of Empire's elision of that
task. [The [contradictions]{.mark} inherent in state formation [in the
third world combined with]{.mark} those of the construction and
maintenance of American [empire]{.mark} in the current global
conjuncture [create]{.mark} both the terror of '[resistance']{.mark}
from below [and]{.mark} '[régime change']{.mark} from above. [Hardt and
Negri]{.mark} tend to [wish these complexities away]{.mark} in their
construction of a world full of libertarian flows of desire and capital.
The 'terror from above' that has been visited on Afghanistan and Iraq in
the wake of 9-11 suggests the [increasing dominance of American state
power]{.mark} qua state power, [instead of the erasure]{.mark} of such
authority [as predicted]{.mark} in Empire. Thirdly -- and most
critically in terms of structural fundamentals -- it is necessary to
undertake a foundational 'political economy' critique deconstructing
Hardt and Negri's assessment of the nature of the global capitalist
system. Their hasty [ironing out]{.mark} of the [fundamentally uneven
development]{.mark} of the global complex of state-society formations
[is]{.mark} simply [unsustainable]{.mark} when one gets down to the
'nitty-gritty' of political economy.]{.underline} Empire smoothes out
all of the contradictions of 'third world' development in spite of
itself. This myopia regarding the underdeveloped world is at the root of
Hardt and Negri's too exuberant celebration of global cyber-capitalism
-- and thus also at the centre of their erasure of the state and their
misunderstanding of the resistanceterror nexus. This essay will thus
reposition empire on the 'real world' rather than the ethereal one
created in Empire -- while acknowledging that much of the required
rethinking has been inspired by the simultaneously frustrating and
stimulating book.

### Turn -- Anthro

#### Turn - Empire's concept of biopower is anthropocentric and reductionist.

**Youatt '08** (R, August 2008, Counting Species: Biopower and the
Global Biodiversity Census, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/30302207>

Driven both by the global loss of biodiversity and by the lack of
knowledge about the vast majority of species that are being lost,
conservation biologists and some of their allies in the environmental
movement have called for and started a massive global census of
biodiversity.1 Most prominently, E.O. Wilson has proposed a new
mobilisation of scientific resources to complete a global survey of
species.2 The identification of biodiversity ʻhotspotsʼ is the first
step in a cascade of biodiversity investigation, Wilson hopes, which
will culminate in a full inventory of global biodiversity and of the
places where it is being lost. With complete information about the
global population of biological species, Wilson is optimistic that we
can undertake more refined conservation measures and ultimately move
towards greater sustainability. In this article, I take the position
that the global biodiversity census is as much about power and political
life and the boundaries between nature and society as it is about
scientific information gathering for conservationist ends. [Drawing on
Foucaultʼs concept of biopower, I suggest that the biodiversity census
provokes us to think about the ways that [biological nonhumans]{.mark}
are embroiled in, and [challenge]{.mark}, the [technologies of power
that see life itself as a political object]{.mark}. To the extent that
the [ʻactionʼ in]{.mark} the [biod]{.mark}iversity census seems to [rest
largely with]{.mark} the [human scientists]{.mark} who do the
categorising, naming, counting, and labelling of nonhuman species, one
analytic stance towards **[this]{.mark} scientific [practice is]{.mark}
an [anthropocentric]{.mark} one.** Here, the focus is on considering the
field of social power in which scientific efforts take place, and asking
questions about the discourses, resources and networks that make a
biodiversity census plausible and possible. But **[what if nonhumans can
be]{.mark} legitimately [considered]{.mark} to be [active
participants]{.mark}** in the field of biopower, just as human subjects
who are censused are?]{.underline} Can nonhumans be sites of resistance
to biopower, and disrupt its governing impulses? I argue that it is
possible, and indeed necessary in the context of biodiversity, to extend
the idea of biopower to include nonhumans as participants. [Like human
subjects, [nonhumans are regulated]{.mark} and rationalised in matrices
of knowledge and science, through which they are [readied as]{.mark}
productive [resources for capitalism and]{.mark} mined as repositories
of [genetic info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}. Nonhuman participation in
an ecological field of biopower also involves being part of an array of
authority in environmental discourses, with effects for both humans and
nonhumans, and constructing new possibilities for biosocial collectives.
However, because nonhumans generally lack the capacity to be
self-regulating subjects but are nonetheless necessary authorities in
figuring biodiversity truth discourses, I suggest that they hold a
different kind of place in biopower than self-regulating human subjects
do. [More specifically, because [nonhumans]{.mark} constitutionally
(rather than intentionally) refuse to internalise the meanings of human
language, they [are able to]{.mark} resist becoming self-regulating
subjects to a significant extent, relying instead on their own semiotic
interpretations of the environment and acting accordingly: for example,
through migrating, reproduc- ing, consuming resources and filling
ecological niches in unexpected ways, biotic nonhumans are constantly
[challeng]{.mark}ing the normalising will of
[biopower]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same time, because environmental
interventions to save species come to be justified on the grounds of
global environmental well-being, the health and continued existence of
nonhumans becomes an increasing imperative. In spite of the fact the
biodiversity census may extend the reach of an ecologically unfriendly
capitalism, I conclude that it will, on balance, reap important
ecological goods in hybridising political practice and acknowledging
extra-human locations of power. The article proceeds as follows. I start
in Section 1 by reviewing the global biodiversity census proposal. In
section 2, I consider how scientific power is extended through the
census and what sources of power it draws on to do so. The science of
censusing nonhumans requires a significant mobilisation of social power
-- financial, technological, institutional and discursive -- in order to
succeed. But because knowledge projects like demography have effects and
techniques that reach beyond these sources of social power into life
itself, I suggest that we cannot fully explain the importance of the
biodiversity census through these means. In section 3, therefore, I
extend Foucaultʼs concept of biopower into the nonhuman world as a means
to explain the productive power and regulatory qualities of the census.
Because the subjects of the biodiversity census are mostly nonhuman,
however, I also consider how the concept of biopower mutates in light of
their participation. 1. THE GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY CENSUS PROPOSAL Spurred
by the problem of a major extinction event in which we do not even know
what or how much is being lost, the basic knowledge-problem that the
global biodiversity census is aimed at addressing is counting and
describing all the species that currently exist in the world. According
to the United Nations Environmental Programʼs (UNEP) Global Biodiversity
Assessment, the best ecological estimates of extant species range from
3.5 million all the way to 111.5 million species, with the most likely
figure at around 13.5 million.3 Only 1.75 million of those species are
currently identified and described, however, or about 13 per cent.4 Each
year, only 13,000 new species are formally described, a snailʼs pace
given the magnitude of the task.5 Even when species have been described,
the data often remains limited. Some species may have become extinct
since being identified. May et al., for example, estimate that about 40
per cent of identified beetle species are known from a single
examination in a single locality, sometimes an observation made decades
ago.6 E.O. Wilsonʼs census proposal includes training and deploying a
cadre of thousands of specialists in systematics, taxonomy and
classification. He calculates that given 40 years of productive
classification work per scientist, at the pace of ten species identified
per year, approximately 25,000 professional lifetimes are needed, a
number which ʻfalls well short of the number of enlisted men in the
standing armed forces of Mongolia, not to mention the trade and retail
personnel of Hinds County, Mississippiʼ.7 In the perfectly rational
system that he hopes for, each expert would be assigned to a specific
classificatory activity. While there are currently only three people in
the world who are sufficiently expert in classifying termites, for
example, Wilson would up their number proportionally to match the fact
that termites comprise ten per cent of the total biomass of tropical
regions. Wilson also champions investment in new computer technology
that can combine scanning-electron microscopes with image-recognition
software. Its goal would be to process and identify species instantly
and to flag new specimens as they are passed through. The data held in
the GenBank project, a computer database aimed at collecting information
on all known DNA and RNA sequences, could be folded into this process.
Given the massive numbers of species and the difficulty of resource
mobilisation, other proposals suggest sampling procedures to get
representative data on the global biopopulation. For example, Terry
Erwin suggests that we aim for ʻmassive but achievable biotic
inventoriesʼ that give us a relative fix on biodiversity.8 While it may
not achieve Wilsonʼs goal of describing all species, targeting specific
taxa and sampling certain species would have the effect of rationalising
what is currently an ad hoc process. In the face of an ever larger human
population, the United States census now makes limited use of
representative sampling procedures, which its proponents argue make it
more accurate than a large-scale but flawed collection of data about
every individual.9 A global biodiversity census would aim to do the
same. Some of the questions that surround the biodiversity census are
scientific ones, such as concerns over the basic species concepts it
employs and the problems of scale involved in identifying micro-species
like bacteria.10 Given that the activities of science are not
self-contained but always embedded in social relations, additional kinds
of questions need to be asked, however. Yet little scholarly attention
has been paid to what this biodiversity censusing effort means in
political or social terms. Political ecologists have usefully inquired
into the general effects of biodiversity discourses and the ways in
which they are intertwined with regimes of power and governmentality,11
but they have not asked whether there is anything specific about the
language and practice of censusing nonhuman bio-entities that is
politically important. Environmental ethicists seem to have ignored the
ethical dimensions of the topic altogether.12 Anthropologists and
ethnobotanists have looked increasingly at the relationship between
biological and cultural diversity, finding strong geographical and
evolutionary correlations between the two and suggesting that a broader
biocultural value linking nature and humans might be found in diversity
complexes.13 However, they have not inquired into the importance of
censusing as a technique by which the differences in biocultures might
be constituted. Political scientists have written extensively and
insightfully about the practice and effects of censusing human
populations,14 but have not taken up how censusing nonhumans relates to
political questions about power. The rest of the article aims to fill
some of these gaps, particularly with respect to questions of how power
functions in contemporary environmental science and politics. 2. THE
BIODIVERSITY CENSUS AND THE SOCIAL POWER OF SCIENTISTS Taken as a
socially-embedded activity, the production of successful scientific
knowledge necessarily requires mobilisation of economic resources,
expansion of institutional power, and discursive legitimation.15
Successful science, in other words, must be socially forged. This point
does not suggest that the status of scientific truth-claims is fully
dependent on social interests; rather, the point is that thinking about
a scientific activity like the biodiversity census requires attending
not only to activities of classification and arguments over species
concepts, but also to how those activities are made possible in the
first place. In short, what kind of social power does the biodiversity
census draw on, depend on and reproduce? What makes the use of a
biodiversity census seem intuitively obvious as the right tool to
address biodiversity loss? Here, I consider two forms of social power,
both crucial to the census project. First, I ask what financial and
institutional resources are necessary to allow agenda-setting power and
the capacity to steer future resources in advantageous ways.16 Second, I
suggest the allure of the census rests partly on the way that
biodiversity scientists are able to tap into discursive power,
particularly the seductive power of discourses like panopticism and
discovery.17 I consider these forms of power in turn. The institutional
push for a global biodiversity census is centred in the United States,
where it has harnessed major sources of funding, including the National
Science Foundation (a \$14 million fund for ʻplanetary biodiversity
inventoriesʼ), the Packard Foundation and Harvard University. It has
created a network of scientific-political organisations mainly based in
the United States and Europe dedicated to censusing different parts of
the natural world and promoting the ʻcompletion of the Linnaean
enterpriseʼ18 into a ʻCatalogue of Lifeʼ -- the Census of Marine Life,
NatureServe, the Global Taxonomy Initiative of the Convention on
Biodiversity, Species 2000 and the All-Species Foundation. There has
been increased funding for the academic fields of taxonomy and
bioinformatics.19 New professional lives have opened up around these
resources -- ʻeach species merits careers of scientific study and
celebration by historians and poetsʼ, as Wilson puts it.20 The
biodiversity census makes these possible first through the act of
species identification and then through the subsequent study of species
behaviour, ecological roles and potential uses for humanity. The key
institutions of the global biodiversity census are organised around
information and communications technologies, which worm their way right
into the names and missions of the organisations involved. The Global
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Integrated Taxonomic
Information System (ITIS) (in partnership with US federal agencies
including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA)) are two of the global
clearinghouses for establishing quality specieslevel data, aiming to be
ʻopen portalsʼ of biodiversity data.21 GBIFʼs mission is to ʻdevelop
methods for sustainably using biodiversity ... \[by\] rapidly, openly,
and freely delivering primary data about biodiversity to everyone in the
global community, using digital technologiesʼ.22 The political intent is
universal access, while its method of delivery is technological. The
universally-wired nature of ʻtheʼ global community is taken for granted,
even as a global digital divide and the barriers of expertise suggest
that no such community exists. One critical role that information
technology plays in organising the global biodiversity census is in its
ability to suggest a panoptic biological future.23 ʻImagine an
electronic page for each species of organism on Earthʼ, Wilson asks us,
ʻavailable everywhere by single access on commandʼ.24 Genealogically
related to projects like Diderotʼs Encylopedie, the modern ʻEncyclopedia
of Lifeʼ is the endpoint and ultimate goal of the censusing project,
organised in a technology that claims to outrun space and time. The
rhetoric of ʻachievingʼ a global biodiversity census also taps into
complex Western narratives of discovery and conquest of nature
(ironically, since the conservation agenda of the census is aimed in
part at preserving the wildness of nature). This rhetoric also draws on
the position of social power held by the modern sciences to reveal the
unknown to human publics. Wilson exhorts supporters of the census to
have ʻfaith in the sprint to the finish of the global censusʼ, promising
that ʻunknown microorganisms \... will be revealedʼ and that ʻnever
again, with fuller knowledge of such extent, need we overlook so many
golden opportunities in the living world around usʼ.25 Similarly, the
All-Species Foundation tells us that the global biodiversity census
ʻoffers an unsurpassable adventure: the exploration of a little-known
planetʼ.26 Finally, the discursive power of the census is connected to
economic life, in the way that it renders nonhuman agents ready for
postmodern capitalism as semiotic constructions (as in genetic codes for
bioprospectors or images in nature videos).27 As Arturo Escobar argues,
whereas ʻnatureʼ marked modern capitalismʼs attitude towards the
nonhuman, ʻbiodiversityʼ is a term of postmodern capitalism, in the way
that it readies nonhuman nature for semiotic use rather than material
use.28 Indeed, postmodern capitalism may protect nature materially even
as it commodifies it semiotically, as in the case of protecting the
Amazon rainforest for its pharmaceutical potentials.29 Yet, as Escobar
argues, ʻonce the semiotic conquest of nature is completed, the
sustainable and rational use of the environment becomes imperativeʼ.30
That is, once biodiversity discourses help conserve an area as a
biodiversity reserve which is made valuable in terms of code-commodity,
it also becomes part of a political system of global environmental
governance that continues to manage it for capitalism. Thus,
conservation biologists have mobilised an expanding pool of financial
and institutional resources, drawing in part on the seductive qualities
of the dream of panopticism and the historical glory of exploration. To
the extent that the agenda of global environmental governance is steered
by their expertise, consensus and public statements,31 they have also
garnered increased authority in speaking about matters of conservation,
ecotourism and economic development. While these forms of social power
(institutional, financial, technological, discursive) explain some of
what is at stake in the biodiversity census, I want to suggest that the
power of a global biodiversity census also rests in its hybridising
force. It introduces nonhumans into the discursive heart of an otherwise
anthropocentric modern human politics, economy and knowledge that has
generally denied that nonhumans have formed a part of these projects.32
It creates a framework through which humans interact with, pattern and
position the diversity of natural nonhumans. Understanding the
importance of the biodiversity census therefore extends questions of
power past its traditional human context into an ecological context. The
important questions, then, are: for whom does this extended politics and
power work?33 What happens to anthropocentric understandings of power
upon the participation of nonhumans in the process? Does the
(re)introduction of nonhumans tell us anything about the ʻwhereabouts of
powerʼ, to use John Allenʼs phrase?34 Can power be nearly everywhere, or
does it have a specifically local character in relations between things
and thus an uneven distribution? To answer these questions, I turn to
the idea of Foucaultian biopower, which considers how power works at the
micro-levels of individual life, in relation to the more traditional
forms of power considered thus far. 3. BIOPOWER AND THE CENSUS In this
section, I start by considering how human censuses are understood to
relate to politics and governing institutions, specifically through the
Foucaultian idea of biopower. Because biopower is concerned with the
ways that techniques like censusing operate on the terrain of ʻlife
itselfʼ, it is particularly suited to thinking about the biodiversity
census, which similarly involves a strategy for administering and
rationalising life in ways that reach into nonhuman biological life as
such.35 The consideration of censusing nonhuman life through the lens of
biopower involves a basic trade-off. [On one hand, the **[extension of
biopower into nonhuman realms raises]{.mark} the spectre of a more
subtle, but nonetheless [corrosive]{.mark}, form of [human power over
the natural]{.mark} world.** On the other hand, because [power]{.mark}
[and resistance]{.mark} are [always co-exist]{.mark}ent,
[nonhumans]{.mark} may [disrupt]{.mark} the functioning of
[environmental governance]{.mark} in new and distinct ways.
Specifically, [biopower faces difficulty]{.mark} in [creating
self-regulating nonhuman subjects]{.mark} who internalise conditions of
subjection.]{.underline} 3.1 Self-regulating subjects and the
justification of power In contrast to absolute power commanded by the
Hobbesian sovereign to ʻtake life or to let liveʼ, Michel Foucault
argues that the modern form of biopower which replaced it in the
nineteenth century was a regulatory and disciplinary form of power that
involved ʻthe administration of bodies and the calculated management of
lifeʼ.36 Biopower organised and administered life, through a variety of
techniques or methods of power that dragged human life itself into the
grid of power-knowledge. Institutions such as universities, public
health agencies and the army, and regulatory forms of knowledge, such as
demography and modern medicine, not only analysed life-processes but
permeated them as well. Yet it was not just the use of these techniques
or the presence of these institutions that characterised
nineteenth-century biopower. Two parallel political shifts made biopower
distinct from sovereign power. The first shift was that the right of the
sovereign to have power over life and death was no longer justified
based on protecting the sovereign from external threat (as in
conscription in cases of war) or internal threat (as in the death
penalty). Rather, the power over life and death was now justified in
terms of the population itself, in modern democratic language. When war
was waged, it was not to protect the sovereign, but in the name of the
people and their continued existence. The justification for biopowerʼs
interventions into the details of life -- reproductive health, the ways
in which we die, normalising vaccinations -- was similarly made in the
name of the population. One effect of this shift, Foucault notes, is
that the death penalty became more difficult to sustain logically: ʻhow
could power exercise its highest prerogatives by putting people to
death, when its main role was to ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to
put this life in order?ʼ37 In other words, the justifications for
powerʼs activities have social effects that exceed the justifications
themselves. What effect, then, will extending ʻprotecting lifeʼ to
ʻprotecting biodiversityʼ have, if we consider the biodiversity census
as an extended example of the logic of biopower? [Part of the answer is
that direct resource exploitation becomes more difficult, since [power
over]{.mark} life/death of [animals, plants, insects or trees can no
longer be justified by needs of the human population]{.mark}/sovereign
to fight natural necessity with all its might.38 [Eco]{.mark}logical
[biopower thus involves]{.mark} both [broader]{.mark} social [trends
like]{.mark} the rise of [modern eco]{.mark}logical
[consciousness]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the emergence of [conservationist
ethics]{.mark} as part of it structural logic.]{.underline} At the same
time, what becomes easier is both the management and regulation of
nonhuman biological life by humans and the direct intervention in, and
mutation of, biological and ecological life-processes, all in the name
of bio- or eco-systemic ʻhealthʼ. [Here, [biopower]{.mark} can be
understood as a logic of eco-governance that simultaneously
[subverts]{.mark} the resource-driven agenda of modern [capital]{.mark}
by trying [to conserve]{.mark} material [nature]{.mark}1 and enables and
rationalises an entirely new form of intervention in life
itself.]{.underline} The ecological sciences, on this reading, are one
of the crucial institutions through which interventions into life are
enacted, and the biodiversity census is one of its primary
power-knowledge techniques. Thinking about biopower as involving
nonhumans also has the consequence of changing the population in whose
name powerʼs exercise is justified. If the idea of biopower adequately
describes the intrusion of scientific, economic and regulatory
techniques into the lives of nonhumans, then administering nonhuman life
must be justified in the name of an expanded population as well -- in
this case, in the name of a global ecological population of species (and
their genes), guided by an ethic of preserving and fostering
biodiversity. In sum, in the name of planetary health (a metaphorical
extension of modern biopowerʼs concern with human public health to a
planetary scale), a new population is configured into which biopower
intervenes, one explicitly composed of human and nonhuman members
participating in ecosystemic communities. The second, parallel shift
that Foucault notes was involved in the move from sovereign to
regulatory power was that there was an unsettling effect on the practice
of governing. [Unlike sovereign power, regulatory [biopower had
the]{.mark} imperative to promote life, to ʻoptimise forces, aptitudes,
and life in generalʼ, and its ʻhighest [function]{.mark} was perhaps no
longer to kill, but [to invest life]{.mark} through and throughʼ.39 Yet,
crucially, it had to do so [in ways that did not make the population
more difficult to govern.]{.mark}]{.underline}40 In other words, however
life was politically managed, it had to be done in ways that ensured
governability. This aspect of biopower was aimed at producing
self-regulating subjects who internalised the qualities that promoted
life but did not fundamentally disrupt social functioning.
Self-regulating subjects were both efficient for power (since subjects
did powerʼs work for it) and governable. [[Yet]{.mark} in this respect,
the movement of [nonhuman entities]{.mark} into the population in whose
name biopower acts [represent]{.mark}s a potential location of
[freedom]{.mark}, or at least resistance, precisely [because]{.mark}
many nonhumans are constitutionally incapable of being self-regulating
subjects who can internalise the conditions of subjection in biopowerʼs
own terms. [Nonhumans do not ʻknowʼ that they are a species]{.mark} or a
member of a specific phylum, in those terms, [or]{.mark} that they have
a [particular gene-sequence]{.mark}; rather, [they]{.mark} [have their
own frameworks]{.mark} of understanding the moments of interaction with
scientists and modes of environmental experience that guide their
actions.]{.underline} In this respect, biotic nonhumans differ from the
human subjects of biopower, who, as Foucaultʼs analysis suggests, become
self-regulating subjects partly in virtue of the way that their
consciousness is structured by biopower -- by its language, its
categories, and the techniques of self-making. When one looks at the
minority of bio-entities that could be made partially self-regulating --
genetically modified crops, pet clones, lab-grown tissue replacement,
gene therapy and pre-selection, regulated game preserves in which
species are fenced in or are trained to learn the boundaries of safe
haven from human predators -- they form a small fraction of the
bio-population. Even in those cases, moreover, there are significant
doubts over whether they can be made into self-regulating subjects in
the same sense as humans. Their ability to accede to and internalise the
normalising effects of power is limited by their biological
constitution. Though they have varying kinds of subjective experience,
they cannot be said to have the self-reflexive kind of subjectivity that
humans do. Whereas human subjectivity is marked by the dual ability to
be a distinct Self in contrast to the environment and to have the
reflexive thought that ʻI am a Selfʼ, nonhumans are generally limited to
the former possibility. If biopower cannot make most nonhumans into
self-regulating subjects, then their governability rests solely on
whether they can be controlled indirectly through the patterned grids of
scientific prediction. Yet as groups and individuals, biological
nonhumans routinely confound predictability, within their own kinds of
subjectivities. They respond to ecological change by unexpectedly
shifting migration patterns and locations. They expand in unanticipated
ways into ecological niches that humans open directly (e.g., suburbs as
feeding grounds for raccoons; rabbits introduced in Australia for
hunting who subsequently overran the countryside; garbage dumps as
sources of food for omnivorous bears) and indirectly (e.g., red-tailed
deer population explosions in New England upon the over-hunting of
deer-predators, causing substantial economic damage and fatal car
accidents). Some species mutate at evolutionary speeds that far exceed
those of humans (e.g., pesticide resistant strains of bugs or
penicillin-resistant viruses). They sometimes form new relations with
other species to the detriment of humans (e.g., birds as carriers of
Asian bird flu). They remake ecosystems into new stabilities and
undermine others. In short, while the lack of subjectivity and
reflexivity in nonhuman populations is usually read as a source of
acquiescence to human interrogation, it seems to also have an opposite
effect, in that it constitutes them as ready sources of resistance and
disruption to the desires of biopower to establish governable
populations. Foucault says of biopower: ʻit is not that life has been
totally integrated into techniques that govern and administer it; it
constantly escapes themʼ.41 Nonhuman agents effect some of the very same
escapes simply by living. Life itself escapes biopower. 3.2. Array of
authorities A second component of biopower is ʻone or more truth
discourses about the "vital" character of living human beings, and an
array of authorities competent to speak that truthʼ.42 In the context of
the nineteenth-century societies that Foucault was analysing, these
truth discourses about living beings included fields like demography and
medicine. In the context of twenty-first-century biopower, Paul Rabinow
and Nikolas Rose suggest that they might be extended to include fields
like genomics, cloning and reproduction.43 What is critical to the truth
discourses surrounding these fields is that there be an array of
authorities, like the human sciences, public health agencies or social
theorists, that both problematise a certain issue and endeavor to
intervene in the field raised by that problematisation. These
authorities both render the issue socially visible and strive to
rationalise solutions. Just as scientists play a central role as
authorities in the truth discourses of human sciences, so too are they
central to the truth discourses of biodiversity loss. The project of the
biodiversity census involves conservation biologists as a critical part
of the authorities competent to create a truth discourse around species
loss and conservation, through the rationalisation of species into an
ordered catalogue of nonhuman life. But the involvement of nonhumans in
this truth discourse exceeds a simple presence as scientific objects,
and raises questions about whether we can think of biopower as
authoritative about nonhumans without any account of how nonhumans might
themselves testify to those truth claims, resist them, or actively
participate to some degree in the making of scientific knowledge. An
alternative account of scientific practice that moves towards such a
distributed model of authority comes from Bruno Latour and others
involved in theorising an actor-network approach, in which human and
nonhuman agents are seen as collaboratively involved in the construction
of scientific truth claims.44 On this account, scientific authority
depends in part on the (nonlinguistic) ʻtestimonyʼ of nonhumans who are
marshalled by scientists to establish the veracity of scientific
accounts.45 While it is still human scientists who problematise the
field of biodiversity loss, then, the array of authorities competent to
ʻspeakʼ the truth discourses surrounding that field is distributed among
both human and nonhuman. This line of argument about authority has three
consequences. First, it speaks to the question of the ʻwhereabouts of
powerʼ. One of the criticisms of Foucaultʼs analytic of power is that
once it is taken past a specific institutional site into the broader
practices of governing, it seems to be everywhere and nowhere.46 In a
broader sense, space and place themselves seem to disappear from power.
In the case of biodiversity sciences, at least, extending the
participants in the biopower formation to nonhumans gives power concrete
locations -- in the places where data is collected, in the laboratories
where representative samples are brought under the microscope, and in
the bodies of species who experience different life-possibilities and
pathways because of the process of classification. What makes
biodiversity discourses potent at all, in other words, is the
marshalling of human and nonhuman authorities to its truth-claims in
particular places and particular biological bodies. Second, the
intrusion of nonhuman life into authority-generating processes like the
biodiversity census disrupts the human subject at the centre of modern
biopower by forcing a new set of constituents into the political field
who cannot quite be captured by it in the same way. Because the biopower
depends on the relative flourishing of life, biopower cannot speak and
act authoritatively on behalf of the health of global biopopulations and
simultaneously extinguish them. The necessity of nonhuman life for
biopower both enables its extension and increases the living things that
disrupt biopowerʼs desire for smooth governing. To return to Foucaultʼs
analysis of the death penalty, if biopower (in contrast with sovereign
power) complicated the state killing its own citizens, then so too
should ecological biopower be seen to complicate the domination of
nonhumans (in modern relations with nature), including the ongoing
anthropogenic species extinction event. Finally, if the Latourian
understanding of authority as distributed between both scientists and
scientific objects is correct, this critique should also apply to
humans, in the human sciences that Foucault was considering. The
authority of scientific claims depends not only on scientists, academics
and public servants, but on the very human subjects that make
authoritative claims possible. Not only is resistance coexistent with
power within human subjectivity, as Foucault claimed,47 but a more
distributed kind of authority also resides in the practices of biopower,
among the subjects who take part in its data collections, experiments
and interventions. 3.3. Biosocial collectivities In Foucaultʼs
historical analysis, the formation of biopower occurs within the context
of the rise of the modern nation-state. Yet the biodiversity crisis,
which I have been thinking of here in terms of an extension of human
biopower into biodiversity-power, presents a political situation in
which there is a veritable state of emergency (species loss), and yet
there is no state in which to declare such a state of emergency. This
observation is true in two senses. It is true, first, in a spatial
sense, in that the biodiversity crisis is global, yet there is no global
state in which such a crisis could effectively be addressed.48 While a
layer of global environmental governance may be growing and even using
environmental problems as a way through which its expansion is made
plausible,49 it does not yet have the logical or practical means to
resolve the wider problems of social justice and development involved in
the biodiversity crisis.50 In a second sense, there is also no political
formation that accepts the participation of nonhumans within its
confines. The nation-state is a modern, secular and thoroughly human
mode of organisation, one that is based around a community of humans who
in turn decide what is right or good for themselves and their
environment. Its reasoning is decidedly and openly anthropocentric, as
ecologists who advance biodiversityʼs cause almost all accept as a
necessary part of communicating the biodiversity crisis to human
publics.51 Similarly, the discourses of global governance draw on a thin
kind of global political community,52 but they do not grasp nonhumans as
participants in their ideological vision. Global governance is hardly
democratic with respect to humans, much less politically inclusive of
nonhumans.53 Understood in this way, when global governance discourses
address biodiversity loss, they do so either as the next logical step in
the postcolonial mission (moving from ʻcivilisation, progress, poverty,
\[to\] environmental sustainabilityʼ),54 or as simply another problem
area for governance to address.55 In the context of biopower that I have
been considering, what then is the effect of global biodiversity census
without a global state? If the modern census was part of a
power-knowledge formation that was both organised by and constitutive of
the nation-state as part of biopower, then a global biodiversity census
should have some transformative effects in constituting political forms.
The hypothesis that I want to suggest is that a biodiversity census will
help construct new ideas of a multi-layered and multi-species global
community. As a way into this hypothesis, consider the effect of the
modern human population census on ideas of community. Benedict Anderson,
for example, argues that the modern census was integrally related to the
creation of the categories necessary for the creation of postcolonial
nation-states. Anderson argues that the ʻ(confusedly) classifying mind
of the colonial stateʼ created identities through the census that might
not have been recognised as such by those who were censused and
classified.56 The census involved a ʻtotalising classificatory grid,
which could be applied with endless flexibility to anything under the
stateʼs real or contemplated controlʼ.57 Yet by undertaking this
project, the conditions of postcolonial nationalism were shaped and
forms of intelligibility were constructed (and imposed) that were not
otherwise there. For present-day aspirants to statehood, a census
remains an important marker of a consolidated national citizenry, as in
the push for a Palestinian census as a way towards achieving a de facto
Palestinian state.58 Similarly, then, a global biodiversity census might
be understood as part of constructing a global biocitizenry and in
forming a global ecopolitical community. Rabinow and Rose suggest that
biopower must include ʻstrategies for intervention in the name of life
or health, initially addressed to populations that may or may not be
territorialised upon the nation, society or pre-given communities, but
may also be specified in terms of emergent bio-social collectivitiesʼ.59
Like Foucault, Rabinow and Rose are concerned with human populations,
but their use of ʻbio-social collectivitiesʼ that are not necessarily
dependent on a territorial population suggests the possibility of forms
of community that are not tied to the nation-state[. If the nation-state
is not necessarily the right analogy for biosocial collectivities of
humans and nonhumans, then Michael [Hardt and]{.mark} Antonio [Negriʼs
expansion of biopower]{.mark} past Foucaultʼs state-bound apparatuses of
governing points towards how a de-territorialised collectivity might be
theorised.60 If Foucaultʼs use of biopower was used in the concrete
historical analysis of the transition in nineteenth-century Europe from
the sovereign state of absolute power over life and death to one ʻin the
name of the peopleʼ of disciplinary and regulatory power, Hardt and
Negri [push]{.mark} the historical [analysis]{.mark} forward [another
step]{.mark} by drawing from Gilles Deleuze the idea of a transition
from a Foucaultian disciplinary society to a society of
control.]{.underline} Disciplinary society exists in relation to
individual subjects, setting the parameters of what is normal and
deviant, prescribing the rules of social behaviour, and constructing the
boundaries of the social space in which its citizens rattle around.
Power in disciplinary society is concentrated in institutions. By
contrast, a society of control moves into the very interior of its
subjects. It regulates not from outside but through its distribution and
internalisation into ʻbrains and bodiesʼ.61 It is a form of power that
exists in networked interiorities (i.e., the linked, self-regulating
consciousness of subjects), not in external impositions, limits,
sanctions or structurings. Power in a society of control is also unique
in the way that it is able to make biopower its exclusive terrain of
reference. For Hardt and Negri, it is also a more totalising form of
power than disciplinary power -- it ʻextends throughout the depths of
the consciousness and bodies of the population -- and at the same time
across the entirety of social relationsʼ.62 It is such an organising
power that Hardt and Negri see as globally operative in the social
production of subjects. But Hardt and Negri are critical of the way in
which the global society of control has been considered in a disembodied
way. They argue that the abstractions of language, communication, and
intellectual ideas have been given productive precedence over the
material and corporeal. 63 [[In their neo-Marxist reading]{.mark}, the
potential of a [biopolitical analysis rests with]{.mark} its study at
[the level of labour, production and bodies. If]{.mark} Marxist
[analysis]{.mark} of modern capitalism [understood **communication as
external**]{.mark} or secondary to the material relations of production,
**[Hardt and Negri]{.mark} want to [read it as internal]{.mark}** and
immanent to production in postmodern capitalism.]{.underline} The
semiotic reconfiguration of postmodern capital that Escobar suggests is
thus the very productive activity in Hardt and Negriʼs framework, and
biopower is a Foucaultian/Marxist hybrid.64 In such a framework,
biodiversity is something produced, and the ʻthingsʼ of biodiversity --
the individuals, the species, the communicative fabric of science around
which knowledge of them is built, the development projects of which
biodiversity is a component -- are implicated in a global society of
control. [Like Foucaultʼs conceptualisation of power, Hardt and Negriʼs
vision of [biopower as a field]{.mark} or fabric [of]{.mark} social and
capitalist [production]{.mark} is an image that [makes us see a total
matrix of power]{.mark}. [Yet]{.mark} their relative [exclusion of
nonhumans is curious]{.mark}, since **[there is a slew of nonhuman
agents outside of that]{.mark} productive [field]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
There is a multitude of nonhumans, so to speak, that includes the
ʻbacterial proletariatʼ, in E.O. Wilsonʼs colourful metaphor and the
nomadic animal populations who routinely exceed national borders.

### Alt Fails

#### The alt fails to solve, only incremental changes at the nation-state level can solve, while sweeping global reforms solving is nothing but a utopian pipe dream.

**Fukuyama '04** (Francis, 7/25/2004, An Antidote To Empire, The New
York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/books/an-antidote-to-empire.html

scientist, political economist, and writer.) //**Doof**

Well before 9/11 and the Iraq war put the idea in everybody\'s mind,
Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri had popularized the notion of a modern
empire. Four years ago, they argued in a widely discussed book \--
titled, as it happens, \'\'Empire\'\' \-- that the globe was ruled by a
new imperial order, different from earlier ones, which were based on
overt military domination. This one had no center; it was managed by the
world\'s wealthy nation-states (particularly the United States), by
multinational corporations and by international institutions like the
World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund. This
empire \-- a k a globalization \-- was exploitative, undemocratic and
repressive, not only for developing countries but also for the excluded
in the rich West. [Hardt and Negri\'s new book, [\'\'Multitude,\'\'
argues]{.mark} that [the antidote to empire is the realization of true
democracy]{.mark}, \'\'the rule of everyone by everyone, a democracy
without qualifiers.\'\' They say that the left needs to [leave behind
outdated concepts like the proletariat and]{.mark} the [working class,
which]{.mark} vastly [oversimplify]{.mark} the gender/racial/ethnic/
class diversities of [today\'s world]{.mark}. [In their place they
propose the]{.mark} term [\'\'multitude]{.mark},\'\' to capture the
\'\'commonality and singularity\'\' of those who stand in opposition to
the wealthy and powerful. [This book]{.mark} \-- which lurches from
analyses of intellectual property rules for genetically engineered
animals to discourses on Dostoyevsky and the myth of the golem \-- deals
with an imaginary problem and a real problem. Unfortunately, it
[provides]{.mark} us with [an **imaginary solution to the real
problem**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The imaginary problem stems from the
authors\' basic understanding of economics and politics, which remains
at its core unreconstructedly Marxist. [[For them, there is no such
thing as voluntary economic exchange]{.mark}, only coercive political
hierarchy]{.underline}: any unequal division of rewards is prima facie
evidence of exploitation. Private property is a form of theft.
[[Globalization has no]{.mark} redeeming [benefits]{.mark} whatsoever.
(East [Asia\'s rise]{.mark} from third- to first-world status in the
last 50 years [seems not to have registered]{.mark} on their mental
map.) Similarly, [democracy is not]{.mark} embodied in constitutions,
political parties or [elections]{.mark}, which are simply manipulated to
benefit elites. The [half of the country that votes Republican is
evidently not part of the]{.mark} book\'s
[multitude]{.mark}.]{.underline} To all this Hardt and Negri add an
extremely confused theory, their take on what Daniel Bell labeled
postindustrial society, and what has more recently been called the
\'\'knowledge economy.\'\' The \'\'immaterial labor\'\' of knowledge
workers differs from labor in the industrial era, Hardt and Negri say,
because it produces not objects but social relations. It is inherently
communal, which implies that no one can legitimately appropriate it for
private gain. Programmers at Microsoft may be surprised to discover that
because they collaborate with one another, their programs belong to
everybody. It\'s hard to know even how to engage this set of assertions.
[**[Globalization is]{.mark} a [complex]{.mark} phenomenon**; it
produces winners and losers among rich and poor alike.]{.underline} But
you would never learn about the complexities from reading
\'\'Multitude.\'\' So let\'s move on to Hardt and Negri\'s real problem,
which has to do with global governance. We have at this point in human
history evolved fairly good democratic political institutions, but only
at the level of the nation-state. With globalization \-- and increased
flows of information, goods, money and people across borders \--
countries are now better able to help, but also to harm, one another. In
the 1990\'s, the harm was felt primarily through financial shocks and
job losses, and since 9/11 it has acquired a military dimension as well.
As the authors state, \'\'one result of the current form of
globalization is that certain national leaders, both elected and
unelected, gain greater powers over populations outside their own
nation-states.\'\' The United States is uniquely implicated in this
charge because of its enormous military, economic and cultural power.
What drove people around the world crazy about the Bush
administration\'s unilateral approach to the Iraq war was its assertion
that it was accountable to no one but American voters for what it did in
distant parts of the globe. And since institutions like the United
Nations are woefully ill equipped to deal with democratic legitimacy,
this democracy deficit is a real and abiding challenge at the
international level. [[The authors]{.mark} are conscious of the charge
that they, like the Seattle anti-globalization protesters they
celebrate, **[don\'t have]{.mark} any real [solutions]{.mark}** to these
matters, so they spend some time discussing how to fix the present
international institutions. Their problem is that any [fixes are]{.mark}
politically difficult if not [impossible]{.mark} to bring about,
[and]{.mark} promise [only marginal benefits]{.mark}. Democratic
institutions that work at the nation-state level don\'t work at global
levels. A true [global democracy]{.mark}, in which all of the earth\'s
billions of people actually vote, [is]{.mark} **an [impossible]{.mark}
dream**, while existing proposals to modify the United Nations Security
Council or change the balance of power between it and the General
Assembly are political nonstarters.]{.underline} Making the World Bank
and I.M.F. more transparent are worthy projects, but hardly solutions to
the underlying issue of democratic accountability. The United States,
meanwhile, has stood in the way of new institutions like the
International Criminal Court. It is at this point that Hardt and Negri
take leave of reality \-- arriving at an imaginary solution to their
real problem. They argue that instead of \'\'repeating old rituals and
tired solutions\'\' we need to begin \'\'a new investigation in order to
formulate a new science of society and politics.\'\' The woolliness of
the subsequent analysis is hard to overstate. According to them, the
fundamental obstacle to true democracy is not just the monopoly of
legitimate force held by nation-states, but the dominance implied in
virtually all hierarchies, which give certain individuals authority over
others. The authors dress up Marx\'s old utopia of the withering away of
the state in the contemporary language of chaos theory and biological
systems, suggesting that hierarchies should be replaced with networks
that reflect the diversity and commonality of the \'\'multitude.\'\' The
difficulty with this line of reasoning is that there is a whole class of
issues networks can\'t resolve. This is why hierarchies, from
nation-states to corporations to university departments, persist, and
why so many left-wing movements claiming to speak on behalf of the
people have ended up monopolizing power. [Indeed, the **[powerlessness
and poverty in today\'s world are due not to]{.mark} the excessive
[power of nation-states, but to their weakness.]{.mark}** [The solution
is not to undermine sovereignty but]{.mark} to **[build stronger
states]{.mark}** in the developing world.]{.underline} To illustrate,
take the very different growth trajectories of East Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa over the past generation. Two of the fastest growing economies in
the world today happen to be in the two most populous countries, China
and India; sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, has tragically seen
declining per capita incomes over the same period. At least part of this
difference is the result of globalization: China and India have
integrated themselves into the global economy, while sub-Saharan Africa
is the one part of the world barely touched by globalization or
multinational corporations. But this raises the question of why India
and China have been able to take advantage of globalization, while
Africa has not. The answer has largely to do with the fact that the
former have strong, well-developed state institutions providing basic
stability and public goods. They had only to get out of the way of
private markets to trigger growth. By contrast, modern states were
virtually unknown in most of sub-Saharan Africa before European
colonialism, and the weakness of states in the region has been the
source of its woes ever since. [[Any project]{.mark}, then, [to
fix]{.mark} the ills of [\'\'empire\'\' has to begin with]{.mark} the
[strengthening]{.mark}, not the dismantling, [of institutions at the
nation-state level.]{.mark} This will not solve the problems of global
governance, but surely any real advance here will come only through
slow, patient innovation and the reform of international institutions.
Hardt and Negri should remember the old insight of the Italian Marxist
Antonio Gramsci, taken up later by the German Greens: [progress is to be
achieved not with utopian dreaming, but with a \'\'long march through
institutions.\'\']{.mark}]{.underline}

[While U.S. hegemony entails perplexities and burdens, an [abandonment
of hegemony may carry]{.mark} risks. Diminished U.S. leadership [could
prove dangerously disruptive of the international system and
imperil]{.mark} the well-being of [people]{.mark}s [everywhere]{.mark},
Americans included. A U.S. retreat [could undermine]{.mark} an
[international economy]{.mark} that has generated impressive global
abundance and peace beneficial to many.]{.underline} Simply consider the
resources now available today (an annual worldwide output of \$30
trillion at the end of the twentieth century) compared to fifty years
earlier when it was a tenth that figure. Imagine what this amazing,
unprecedented leap in global productivity has meant to health and
welfare in all lands. Without U.S. leadership, so the defenders of
hegemony claim, these gains might well have been limited, even
nonexistent. [A future of diminished abundance might prove distinctly
unpleasant: [greater discord among states and peoples leading to rising
cultural intolerance]{.mark}, flaring [nationalist fervor]{.mark} and
rivalry, deepening [international divisions]{.mark}, and [fraying
economic ties]{.mark} that would slow growth and press down longevity
and health in wide swaths of the human population.]{.underline} This
would be a world of narrower horizons, fewer choices, and less
interaction among peoples and cultures. [It would also be a world with
[diminish]{.mark}ed [capacity for addressing]{.mark} mounting [global
problems]{.mark}. [Advocates for maintaining U.S. dominance]{.mark}
along current neoliberal lines [hold the ideological high
ground.]{.mark}]{.underline} The predominant version of American
nationalism took a distinctly activist turn in the course of the
twentieth century. From the 1890s to the 1920s the notion of the United
States as a dynamic republic with the vision and energy to manage the
world's affairs began to come into its own. Republicans dedicated to an
assertive policy along a broad front contributed to this shift in
thinking. So too did Woodrow Wilson with his fervent support for the
ideal of a progressive international society. In 1941 Henry Luce blended
this set of nationalist ideas in his vision of an American century
marked by the advance of political freedom, unhampered commerce, and
general economic abundance. The most activist U.S. leaders after World
War II drew from this creed, as appealing to visionary Wilsonians such
as Harry Truman as to corporate-minded Republicans such as Ronald Reagan
and the younger Bush. [Over the past half century [it has become an
orthodoxy so potent]{.mark} in its appeal [that challengers risk
exile]{.mark} from membership in the foreign policy establishment [and
exclusion]{.mark} from government posts.]{.underline} Such is the
allegiance commanded by the one true faith. Or as John Adams observed
pungently, "Power always thinks it has a great Soul, and vast Views."¹⁰
Even so, a good case can be made for a U.S. retreat from hegemony and
toward a more modest and sustainable role in the world. A searching
critique has no reason to linger on matters of style, particularly such
easy targets as a policy governed by restless unilateralism or
simplistic assumptions. [Such a [critique should]{.mark} instead [turn
to the hegemonic project itself]{.mark}. The place to begin a critical
evaluation is with the tendency of the [champions of heg]{.mark}emony to
[oversell the product]{.mark}. They point to its historical achievements
to the neglect of the costs it has imposed on others. The leaders of
[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [have managed heg]{.mark}emony with
a lamentably heavy hand---[with scant respect for]{.mark} human [life
and]{.mark} scant respect for human [diversity]{.mark}. [Millions
died]{.mark} and many societies suffered profound disruption as a result
of the U.S. interventions that dot the pages of this
account.]{.underline} To those costs would have to be added an
intolerance of views on markets and the state that diverge from U.S.
preferences. As a result, U.S. pressure has in some cases blocked or
disrupted socioeconomic and political experiments favored by others,
especially in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. [In other
cases, an insistence on an American way has generated tensions with
major states such as China or regions such as western Europe with
divergent interests and values; [that insistence has]{.mark} also
[strained ties with]{.mark} genuinely international organizations such
as [the UN]{.mark}. On virtually every front [U.S. leaders]{.mark} have
left themselves open to charges of hypocrisy---of ignoring if not
[violat]{.mark}ing the ideals of [democracy and
self-determination]{.mark} that they publicly profess.]{.underline} A
look into the future reveals more grounds for doubts about the hegemonic
project. [Put simply, [the time for U.S. heg]{.mark}emony [may have
passed]{.mark}. As the relative U.S. advantage in economic might and
cultural appeal slips, attempts to exercise hegemony may prove
increasingly counterproductive, doing more to further undermine than to
confirm U.S. dominance. The U.S. economy labors under limits. Persistent
structural [problems include oil dependency, low domestic
savings]{.mark}, and [deep trade and]{.mark} federal [budget
deficits]{.mark}.]{.underline} The core U.S. cultural model---a faith in
unending corporate-driven growth and the unending delights of
consumerism---may be fading at least in the developed world. Western
Europe and Japan have both drawn alongside the United States in their
technological capacity, their income levels, their capital resources,
and the depth and integration of their home markets. They need no longer
look to the United States as a model in any of these areas. The consumer
revolution led by Americans may have at least in these two regions run
its course. Rising per capita income beyond a point (in the range of
\$15,000 in a fair sampling of countries recently surveyed) seems to
produce no greater individual satisfaction while imposing costs captured
not by conventional GDP data but by social GDP estimates.¹¹ In military
affairs, the United States has retained, even increased, its dominance.
But to what end? Its massive nuclear stockpile can be used only at the
risk of profound and widespread moral revulsion and in some
circumstances of devastating counterstrikes. Its high-tech forces may be
the wonder of the world. But they are effective only against the most
peripheral and isolated of states (in what one observer has dismissed as
"theatrical micromilitarism"), and they have limited capacity to rebuild
what they have destroyed.¹² The exercise of military might has proven a
poor substitute for the intricacies of diplomatic negotiation, the
trade-offs indispensable to international comity, and the long-term
commitment of resources to economic development and human welfare.
Finally, hegemony may hurt the hegemon. Evidence can be found in the
privileging of corporate interests harmful to popular welfare, a
fixation with military power that amounts to a national obsession, an
increasingly infantilized and inert public, and the rise of an imperial
presidency antithetical to genuine democracy. These trends validate a
sharply critical view of foreign adventures that prevailed during the
country's first century. Proponents of republicanism claimed that
crusades, even crusades conducted in the name of freedom, threatened
freedom at home. [The history of republican experiments across history
showed that [foreign entanglements]{.mark} and adventures created
dangerous concentrations of political power within and
[undermined]{.mark} the very [civic virtues on which the survival of any
republic depended]{.mark}.]{.underline} Vindicating this republican fear
is the rise of the imperial president and the concomitant atrophy of the
democratic process. While most Americans today may not see hegemony
through this anxious republican lens, many have voiced their discontent
with the outward thrust of U.S. policy. Some express it in frustration
and chagrin directed not against U.S. leaders but against a seemingly
ungrateful, unyielding, dangerous world and call for scaling back
international commitments. The most restive have contended that a more
isolated, less burdened America would be better off--- less vulnerable
to attack, less dependent on fickle friends, less likely to get
entangled in distant quarrels, and more secure in its homeland and its
domestic liberties. Others refuse to go this far and instead put the
blame squarely on U.S. leaders---political and corporate---whose
free-market, environmental, and human rights policies have betrayed
values as important at home as in the international community. Taken
together, these critical reactions suggest a broad-based skepticism
about hegemony. But the critics may be so fundamentally divided
philosophically, politically, regionally, and socially that they cannot
cobble together a common program to serve as an alternative to hegemony.
A retreat from hegemony need not lead to isolationism. This myth about
the nature of U.S. foreign relations in the past, which was constructed
in the first place for the very purpose of justifying U.S. dominance, is
likely to figure prominently in any defense of the status quo. But the
notion of isolation is flawed as history and as a source of lessons.
Today as earlier, the United States has a major stake in a productive,
peaceful, and just global society. [By extension, [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has an obligation]{.mark} rooted in self-interest if
not calculations of altruism and long-term human welfare [to]{.mark}
help [mobilize]{.mark} a collective [international response to]{.mark}
the [problems]{.mark} generated by that society.]{.underline} A retreat
implies that the United States would act in world affairs not as the
leader but as a leader, perhaps in some circumstances the first among
equals. Engaging in a genuinely collaborative relationship with other
states and taking international institutions and norms seriously may
hold out the best hope of extending the considerable achievements of the
previous fifty years and in the bargain maintaining U.S. influence and
advancing U.S. well-being. The historical case for the efficacy of
collaboration is compelling. The U.S. role after World War I calmed, for
a time at least, the arms race, gave the Europeans a chance to sort out
their monetary tangle, and sustained the turn-of-the-century drive to
create humane standards of international conduct. The post--World War II
record is even more striking. The achievements in setting norms (such as
outlawing genocide), rehabilitating defeated Germany and Japan, and
creating a framework for global prosperity were the result of
collaboration richly repaid in international support and respect, not to
mention enhanced U.S. security. This collaborative element helped not
only to distinguish the U.S. from the Soviet side during the Cold War,
but also to determine the outcome of a competition that was as much
about systems and values as military might. International cooperation is
not an illusion; it yields results far better than a course defined by
narrow self-interest and pursued by brute force. Whatever the
attractions of a more modest, collaborative internationalism, winning
broad acceptance of such an approach faces serious difficulties. It
requires that Americans think about their role in the world in a fresh,
genuinely global way quite distinct from the cautious opportunism
familiar from the first U.S. century and the rising assertiveness that
has marked recent decades. It also requires a sensitivity to the
intricacies of the global system and the cultural diversity of its
parts. That sensitivity will not come easily to today's body politic,
which features a disengaged, ill-schooled public and a political class
beholden to interest groups and trapped by shallow rhetoric and narrow,
short-term calculations. Above all, the middle way offers nothing heroic
to a country of individualists that may be dependent on civic
nationalism as one of the few sources of collective identity. Indeed,
calls for serious, long-term support for economic development programs,
genuine respect for international norms, and tolerance for regional
diversity collide with prevailing nationalist and neoliberal notions,
which continue to inspire bold dreams of global transformation under the
American aegis and in the American image. [A [retreat from hegemony
would require a lot]{.mark}: a more cosmopolitan understanding of other
cultures, a more sophisticated grasp of U.S. limits, a genuinely
democratic electoral system responsive to popular preferences, and a
better informed electorate able to think through those
preferences.]{.underline} The fate of the current ascendancy with its
hegemonic dimensions may well hang on how Americans measure up to these
high standards and how rapidly structural problems eat away at the
foundations of our hegemony. What the next page of the national story
has to say may depend on how well we take into account the possibilities
and constraints created by a history of burgeoning state power, strong
nationalism, and intrusive global forces.
