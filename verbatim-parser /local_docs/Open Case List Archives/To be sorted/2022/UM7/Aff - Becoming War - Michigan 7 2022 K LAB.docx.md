#### The idea that security cooperation can exist is a fallacy- we are in a war now, and the university is both a birth place and site of war- debate is one of those warzones, where we militarize against black and indigenous bodies. 

Howell 18, (Howell, Allison (2018). Forget "militarization": race,
disability and the "martial politics" of the police and of the

Just as "militarization" has guided inquiry into contemporary police
violence, it has also been used to call attention to worrying
connections between the university and the US national security
apparatus. One prominent example is the series of Vice News reports
exposing the "100 Most Militarized Universities in America" (Arkin and
O'Brien 2015a, 2015b). The authors of the study note that initially they
were reluctant to use the term "militarization," which was not meant to
simply evoke ... ROTC \[Reserve Officer Training Corps\] drills held on
a campus quad. It was also a measure of university labs funded by US
intelligence agencies, administrators with strong ties to those same
agencies, and, most importantly, the educational backgrounds of the
approximately 1.4 million people who hold Top Secret clearance. (Arkin
and O'Brien 2015a) But "[[militarization" leads us to underestimate the
depth and extent of national security ties to the university, past and
present, and to assume that universities can revert to some
non-militarized past]{.underline}]{.mark}. This limitation is also
evident in scholarly literature. One of the central scholarly texts on
the so-called "militarization" of the university is Giroux's The
University in Chains (2007). Cited hundreds of times, and reported on in
popular media, it argues that the post-9/11 period saw a significant
acceleration of the corporatization and militarization of the university
(Giroux 2007, 2008). Giroux goes so far as to say that while
corporatization had previously taken root in the university, "it is only
in the aftermath of 9/11 that the university has also become an intense
site of militarization" (Giroux 2008, 58). Furthermore, "militarization"
of the university begins for Giroux only after World War II (see also
Chomsky et al. 1998). These popular and scholarly works identify
important changes in the nature of military involvement in universities.
For example, the Vice report notes [that [funding now flows to
intelligence-gathering disciplines]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., computer
science[[) rather than solely weapons-oriented ones]{.mark} (e.g.,
physics). [Yet research guided by the concept of "militarization" falls
into the trap of imagining military encroachment on previously civil
institutions: "the idea of the university as a site of critical
thinking, public service and socially responsible research appears to
have been usurped]{.mark}" (Giroux 2008, 63). [This is a fantasy. The
university was never such a pure site]{.mark}. Many [American
universities were built with slave labor or its proceeds]{.mark} (Brown
University Committee on Slavery and Justice n.d[.), and from the outset
have contributed vitally to colonization and White
supremacy]{.mark}]{.underline}. By positing a purely civilian "before"
to a military "after," "militarization" accounts wrongfully elide this
history[. [In the American university no such "before" exists. This is
not to say nothing has changed.]{.mark} [Seeing the university as a site
of "martial politics" allows us to provide a historical account attuned
to the ways in which politics is shaped by the precise forms warfare
takes.]{.mark}]{.underline} Most academic disciplines -- the very
categories by which we organize knowledge -- were fundamentally shaped
by conquest, warfare and military funding. [[This is not only true for
IR]{.underline}]{.mark}, a discipline born out of colonialism and war
(Vitalis 10 A. HOWELL 2015[), [but for any number of other disciplines
from physics]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gusterson 1998, 2011) to business
(Cowen 2014[) [to neuroscience]{.mark}]{.underline} (Howell 2017).
Excavating these histories gives us a sense of how thoroughly we live
with "martial politics." Several disciplines were said to have been
"militarized" after 9/11. Most controversially, medicine, psychiatry,
psychology and anthropology all had major debates about involvement in
torture and warfare in their professional associations. In anthropology,
for example, this debate concerned the 2008 establishment of Project
Minerva (which provided \$50 million in defense funding to social
sciences) and the recruitment of anthropologists in counterinsurgency
warfare through the Human Terrain Program (Gusterson 2009). [[To
describe this as the "militarization" of anthropology, however, is to
ignore that anthropology is foundationally a colonial discipline set up
to catalog "primitive" subject peoples]{.mark}, [with a long history of
entanglement with the security state]{.mark}]{.underline}, not least in
Cold War-era counterinsurgency operations in Latin America and Asia
(Gusterson 2009). [[The concept of "martial politics" allows us to pose
new questions about the historical relationship between formal knowledge
production and forms of warfare]{.mark},]{.underline} rather than just
relations between the university and the military. [[It allows us to ask
how certain forms of warfare are produced by, and produce, academic
disciplines]{.underline}]{.mark}. The nature of this mutual production
will differ depending on the particular military strategy undertaken at
any historical moment. The case of psychology is instructive here. After
psychologists were implicated in devising, administering and overseeing
torture at the US naval base at Guantánamo Bay (Howell 2007), concern
was raised about the "militarization" of psychology (Ariggo, Eidelson,
and Bennett 2012). Again, this concern assumes that the discipline was
once free from involvement in war or colonialism, and that an unusual
trespass occurred after 9/11. Not so. Since almost its very foundation,
psychology has been tied to forms of military strategy. In the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, psychology was a fledgling
discipline and was understood as a humanistic form of knowledge. That
changed drastically in World War I. At that time Robert Yerkes, a
eugenics proponent and professor of psychology, was President of the
American Psychological Association. Convinced that psychologists could
be of service in the war, and that war could be useful to psychologists,
Yerkes approached the US Army with a proposition: he could help the Army
with its personnel problem (of appropriately placing the massive number
of new recruits) in return for funding and access to an unprecedented
number of subjects on which to experiment: soldiers. World War I enabled
the first mass scientific experiment in psychology in the form of
intelligence testing. The data accumulated provided fodder for a
generation of psychologists, establishing the experiment as the primary
methodology of psychology and massively INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL
OF POLITICS 11 reshaping the discipline from a philosophical/humanistic
one into an (American) science. This constitutes a symbiotic
relationship: psychology was not "militarized" in World War I. Rather,
it propelled a particular kind of warfare: industrial warfare conducted
on frontlines, involving mass mobilization and requiring new personnel
management techniques. Wartime support, in return, worked to reshape
psychology into a science. [[The academy is not the victim of military
breach but has foundationally been produced and formed, in its
specificities, through warfare -- and has formed warfare in return as a
technology of]{.mark} [security]{.mark} (]{.underline}Howell 2011).
Psychology was already well steeped in the racist and ableist science of
eugenics prior to World War I (Mitchell and Snyder 2003; Carey 2009;
Thomson 2010), but through military funding it was able to systematize
its eugenicism as a science of "intelligence." This martial entanglement
did not end with the war and the return of psychology to "domestic"
applications[[. Intelligence data not only established psychology as a
science but went on to practical applications in war-like relations of
disability and race both within the]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[US and other colonial settings]{.underline}]{.mark}. Three examples
follow that demonstrate this move. First, the data from the Army
experiment produced results that "proved" that the average American had
the intelligence level of a 13-year-old, just above the level of "moron"
(an ableist construct). This contributed to a moral panic about the
degeneration of the "stock" of the American nation due to Southern
European immigrants, and led to some of the first sweeping US
immigration restrictions. It also bolstered mental hygiene and eugenics
movements, promoting the sterilization of disabled, racialized,
Indigenous or "promiscuous" women who were labeled feeble-minded (Carey
2003). This form of martial politics perpetrates violence especially on
women's bodies, managing their sexuality and reproductive capacities for
the purposes of extirpating "dangerous" or degenerate populations.
Second, since they were constructed by White men who saw "intelligence"
in their own image, the Army tests unsurprisingly placed the "negro" at
the bottom of a racist (and sexist) hierarchy of intelligence (Mensh and
Mensh 1991; Gould 1999). With their sheen of objective science, these
very same Army tests were administered in South Africa and other
colonies, justifying colonial rule and later Apartheid. Finally, Carl
Brigham, who was part of the Army experiment team, and later a Princeton
University professor and member of the advisory council of the American
Eugenics Society, went on to create the high school Scholastic Aptitude
Tests (SATs). The SATs remain the cornerstone of one of the most
pernicious and racist aspects of the Army tests' afterlife: standardized
testing. This regime, to this day, outrageously ranks African American
students as having 12 A. HOWELL lower intelligence, or aptitude,
significantly reducing access to higher education and thus economic
mobility. All this history, all these contributions of the discipline of
psychology to unjust dynamics surrounding race, disability, poverty and
gender, are shuttered by a "militarization" framework because it assumes
that when psychology is used in war (e.g., in torture) that this is an
aberration rather than part of a broad history of violence done to
marginalized people, citizens and enemies alike. In thinking through the
"martial politics" of the university, any number of disciplines could be
subjected to this kind of analysis. Returning to Maneuvers, consider the
case of nursing, to which Enloe (2000) directs her attention in
assessing the "militarization" of women's lives. The chapter in question
perceptively begins with Florence Nightingale, who is widely considered
to be the "mother" of nursing, a pioneer in statistical visualization
and a major figure in the reform of public health and medical care in
both the Crimean War and Victorian workhouses. Yet Nightingale sits
uneasily in a framework that inquires into the "militarization" of
women's lives because, as Enloe (2000, 204) shows, as a patriotic
upper-class White English woman, she herself was active in propelling
"militarization." Because of its "militarization" framework, Enloe's
account misses the fact that warfare and nursing were both modernized
and professionalized through their mutual encounter. Nightingale's
innovations transformed siege warfare, helping ensure British victory in
the Crimea, and laid the foundations for World War I industrial warfare.
After Nightingale returned from the war she was instrumental in creating
nursing as a profession and discipline of study, using techniques
developed for military purposes in "domestic" settings such as
workhouses. The story here is not one of military encroachment on
nursing; rather, nursing became a discipline and profession initially
through war, and subsequently through war-like relations with the poor.
This symbiosis between war and academic disciplines such as nursing,
psychology and -- for that matter -- IR should make it unsurprising when
war-like relations are propelled through knowledge created in these
disciplines. [[When we view academic disciplines, or indeed the
university as a whole, through the lens of "martial politics" it becomes
clear they are not innocent domains sullied by military
values.]{.underline}]{.mark} Rather, like the can of soup[[, their form
and function are embedded in how they emerge out of and simultaneously
shape warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even when "militarization" accounts
are historical, they lead us to misconstrue the importance and nature of
that history. [[When there is violence in domestic political
life]{.underline}]{.mark} -- whether the outright violence of killer
cops or the structural violence of the SATs -- it is not that "war" is
encroaching on "peace," and [[it is not that "the military" is
trespassing on the "civilian.]{.mark}" [Rather, "martial politics" are
fundamental to the constitution and continued production of liberal
democracies such as the US]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not equally at
all parts of the population but targets those who are constituted as a
threat to the nation's strength or civil order.

#### Our affective relationality drives us towards war- a drive that creates an inevitability of violence.

[[War as defined by classical war studies suggests a distinct class of
actors, interests, aims, and expertise.]{.mark} [As a result, the study
of war as well as much of the social mobilization of war presumes an
exteriority of war and warfare from other sectors and institutions like
the economy or the state]{.mark}.]{.underline} For those who study
military history, war---in this limited understanding---can certainly be
decisive in the rise and fall of nation-states and even transformations
of the global system when that system is only indexed by the states that
populate it, but the pursuit of these histories still presumes a kind of
exceptional character of war. War following this line of thought is a
cataclysmic event that interrupts 2. war as a form of life 60---Chapter
2 the otherwise normal character of daily life. [[For others]{.mark},
particularly [in]{.mark} the field of [strategic]{.mark}
[studies]{.mark}, [warfare is a tool]{.mark}]{.underline}, an instrument
whereby states and sometimes organizations pursue ends beyond the limits
of politics and persuasion. War compels and determines a course of
action as an orchestral direction of overwhelming force. [[For those who
hope to abolish war, a parallel exteriority animates their theorizing
about war]{.mark}. [War, according to these thinkers, is reducible
to]{.mark} the [self]{.mark}-[interest]{.mark} of hegemonic states, the
militarism of soldiers, and the self-amplifying loop of profit and
power.]{.underline} Presidents, generals, ceos, arms dealers, and
patriots come together to pursue war as an end in itself. Again, those
actors and those pursuits are treated as outside the normal realm of
human social relations. But what if war is history? What if the very
form of life that created, was reinforced by, mutated with, and emerged
from the Eurocene is warlike? State-making, territorialization,
expansion, annihilation, settlement, and globalization are all warlike
relations. I want to consider the possibility of [[war and warlike
relations as processes of making a form of life in which warfare is
normal]{.underline}]{.mark}. And what I mean by normal is much more than
what we mean when we use concepts like ideology or legitimacy or
discipline. By normal, I mean the very fabric of relations that makes a
form of life and a world: a war body, a war assemblage, a war ecology. I
am not suggesting that war is the only form of life. There are surviving
forms of life interior and exterior to the Eurocene. No process of
annihilation succeeds without leaving at least a trace.3 However, the
normal workings of daily global life are a state of war. Rather than
think of state of war in the juridical or theoretical sense, which
distinguish war from peace on the grounds of declarations or measures of
order, I want to consider war as an ecology endemic to the Eurocene. So
by state of war I mean state in the sense that physicists or chemists
think about states of matter. Every state of matter is an order, and
despite that order, every state of matter has some elements of other
states. A state of matter exhibits properties like solidity, liquidity,
gaseousness, or the full-on freak-out of plasma but is not entirely made
up of that state. And yet the state still has an effect despite that
heterogeneity. So to say that we live in a global state of war, and that
the making of the Eurocene was that making of a global state of war, is
to say that war intensifies the field of relations that make the world
what it is right now, not that it exhausts the possibility of what the
world can become. Instead, the [[practices and organizations---from
resource extraction, enclosure, carbon liberation,]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[racialization, mass incarceration, border enforcement, policing and
security practices, primitive accumulation by dispossession, targeted
strikes, to all out combat---are relations of war
rather]{.underline}]{.mark} than merely correlates or opportunities War
as a Form of Life---61 for a war metaphor. To put it a bit more bluntly,
politics, colonialism, settlement, capitalism, ecological destruction,
racism, and misogynies are not wars by other means---[[they are
war]{.mark}. [War is not a metaphor; it is an intensive fabric of
relations making]{.mark}]{.underline} the Eurocene. To make this claim
requires rethinking---somewhat bombastically---the meaning of war. If
war has such a wide application, it would seem to mean nothing. In
talks, roundtables, and casual conversations, colleagues have often
suggested that such an expansive definition of war is polemical or even
absurd. Others have said that spreading war so thin cheapens the
sacrifices and tragedies of those who have experienced "real war." It is
curious to me that many of the same people have no difficulty assigning
similar base or structuring characteristics to capitalism, settlement,
or patriarchy. I do not see war as a replacement or a displacement of
those structuring structures. Instead, war is like those other
complicated, heterogeneous, abstract machines but interrelated and
importantly semiautonomous in the making of the world.

#### NATO is a mechanism of colonial war- we use it in a war for biopolitical hegemony, making any non-NATO country a guest in their own territories, existing only because of an impossible desire for dominance and control- the most prevalent violence today is not the bombings themselves, but instead the assignment of life v. death.

[It is here that we can see the sovereignty of the host in the brash
chauvinism that often calls itself humanitarian
intervention]{.underline}. What is often championed as a politically
desirable act in the abstract within the current debates over the
obligation or traditions of cosmopolitan thinking rarely returns to how
one would address those in need or how to go about determining the kind
of help desired. The idea that those who intervene are \'guests\' in the
country they are intervening in is not a significant part of these
discussions. The common example used by advocates of humanitarian
intervention to dismiss considerations of consent is to compare such
actions to those of putting out a fire in a neighbor\'s house. The
simplicity of this metaphor, in its attempt to assert itself as
irrefutable common sense, requires interrogation. [The example of
[NATO\'s involvement in Kosovo is instructive]{.mark} on this point. The
decision to use aerial bombing rather than to provide ground support, or
to work in tandem with groups already resisting on the ground---which
would both risk casualties and political embarrassment---is more like
seeing you neighbors front porch on fire and bulldozing the rest of the
house so that the fire does not spread to their storage
shed]{.underline} or from the shed to your own house. Slavoj Zizek
argues that [[the NATO actions in Kosovo suffered from a combination of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Powell doctrines [[desire for
bloodless]{.underline}]{.mark} (American Blood[) [and visually decisive
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Zizek calls this [[humanized
militarism]{.mark}; no one wants to choose sides]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} politically [commit]{.underline} as a result of the
devastation that ensues in the failure to have a war without war. He
characterizes this by the extensive use of air power and other means,
which put Americans out of harms way. Such a strategy, of course, is not
responsive to the needs of those who are supposedly being helped.
Precision bombing is a little like chainsaw surgery. Even in its most
successful renditions the damage to infrastructure and the death of
noncombatants---particularly in urban areas in which the \'enemy\' and
the \'friend\' ultimately live in the same space---demonstrates that
[the ethical commitment expresses a hierarchy of commitments.
First]{.underline} commitment, U.S[. strategic interest]{.underline},
derived from that goal, the safety of U.S. troops whose loss compromises
U.S. war fighting capabilities as a result of declining public support.
[Second]{.underline}, an [[overarching]{.underline}]{.mark} commitment
to strategic interest and [[support]{.underline}]{.mark} or tolerance
[[of great power allies]{.underline}.]{.mark} How will Russia respond?
Will this signal a shift in U.S. policy towards minority groups and
anger China? By the time the interest of those in [Kosovo]{.underline}
i[s]{.underline} considered, their [\'ethical\' weight has decreased
significantly]{.underline} in the open market of interests that and
policy choices. These choices emerge through relays between the right of
the host and its sovereign authority to determine the fate of

Kosovars. The U.S. ability to assert itself as the sovereign of
sovereigns is apparent in these decisions. Foucault\'s notion of
biopower, the sovereign right to give life and take life away, appears
starkly in William Jefferson Clinton\'s execution of the
intervention.322 \"We\" are the master of our domain and our domain is
determined by our right to decide. Since we reserve and exercise that
right irrespective of borders or national origin, our domain---as
indexed by acts of sovereign violence whether covert or overt---is
global. The sovereign decision to act in Kosovo through NATO as proxy
parallels the decision for in action in Rwanda. One exercises the
sovereign violence of the United States to act, to save Kosovo, the
other confirms the United States sovereign power to let the Tutsis of
Rwanda die. The fact the United State through its position in the
Security Council not only blocked the involvement of other nations but
refused to jam Hutu radio broadcast expresses a preemptory sovereign
right. [[We not only determine who shall be killed, but who will be
saved]{.mark},]{.underline} as in the unimpeded slaughter of Rwandan
Tutsis. The distinction between acts of commission and omission
evaporates in this rendering of sovereignty. Or rather there is no such
thing as \'omission\' in a world in which the United States asserts the
role of the sovereign of sovereigns. The glimmer of hope in U.S. power
is that the United States should be held accountable not only for what
it has done, war crimes in Faluja, but everything it hasn\'t done, the
genocides in Sudan and Rwanda. What makes this impossible is the absence
or weakness of a site from which one could muster the authority to
prosecute the United States. After all, such an act would be itself an
incredible act of sovereign authority. The question addressed by
Agamben, and more productively by Derrida, is how to do this without the
banal return to classic power politics i.e. the replacement of one
super-sovereign state, the United States, with another sovereign state
or collection of states, like the European Union. Derrida poses the
possibility that the International Criminal Court and other pressures
towards global governance could provide such an avenue. Rather than
abandon sovereign violence, as Agamben seems to attempt without much
luck, Derrida proposes the collectivization of Sovereignty to turn its
contradiction---U.S. global power based on a global consent that it does
not posses---against itself. While I find such a possibility promising,
hospitality and Cosmopolitanism cannot serve as the basis for the
\'collectivization\' of sovereign right. Hospitality as this section
makes clear contains the disavowed assumption of the hose. [[The
European locations requires that all who respond to the invitation of
the host, Europe, be forever guests in their own world, further
reinforcing the violent and inadequate relation between postcolonial
nations and their former colonizers.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The way in which our war planning is logically structured is created by the emerging technologies professed in the resolution- the scientific method is the method by which we attempt to plan and sanitize war into the knowable, and research into these areas gives us a false paradigm of mastery.

**Bousquet 09,** (Antoine Bousquet is reader in international relations

Warfare: Order and Chaos on the Battlefields of Modernity, 2009)

How has war, an activity traditionally dominated by institutions
extolling the virtues of hierarchical command and submission to orders,
come to be understood essentially in terms of decentralised networks of
combatants connected together by horizontal information links? The most
popular account of this momentous transformation usually centres on the
availability of a new cornucopia of information and communication
technologies that has radically altered the possibilities of human
interaction and social organisation. It is a seductive tale combining
both simplicity and apparent explanatory power, and indeed widespread
applications of such technology can be readily identified[. Yet
[technology is first and foremost a tool and one that only takes on
meaning and purpose within the specific social and cultural formations
in which it is deployed]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nor does it appear ex
nihilo but as the product of a particular human engagement with the
world. As Martin van Creveld has observed, [\"[behind military hardware
there is]{.mark} hardware in general, and behind that [there]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} [technology]{.mark} as a certain kind of know-how, [as a way
of looking at the world and coping with its
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}s.\" 3 In the present age, it is science
that provides the dominant way of looking at the world whether as a
methodological disposition to problem-solving or in informing our
conceptions of how the world works. Our present understanding of the
social world in terms of information and networks is directly reflected
in the central preoccupations of contemporary science. Indeed the
genealogy of the concepts of swarming and self-synchronisation dear to
network-centric warfare can be traced back to the scientific theories of
chaos and complexity which 2 Transformation Warfare \'07, Virginia
Beach, VA Convention Center, June 2007. 3 Martin van Creveld, Technology
and War: From 2000 B. C. to the Present (New York: Free Press, 1 989),
p. 1. 2 INTRODUCTION have emerged over the past few decades. Where
technology has played a tole, it is in conjunction with the scientific
conceptual frameworks that have accompanied its development and
diffusion. [[From the very introduction of the term of network-centric
warfare]{.mark} in 1 998, [military doctrine and scientific
theory]{.mark} [were]{.mark} being [explicitly linked:]{.mark}
\"military operations are enormously complex, and complexity theory
tells us that such enterprises organise best from the
bottom-up]{.underline}.\"4 Nor is this a novel phenomenon. Scientific
concepts and theoretical frameworks have been influencing military
thought and practice since the inception of the Scientific Revolution in
the late sixteenth century[. Moreover [the interface between science and
warfare has been far from restricted to one-way traffic]{.mark}, with
military imperatives stimulating both technological and scientific
discoveries]{.underline}. From the earliest synergies between the study
of the motion of bodies and military ballistics, science and the
military arts have been inextricably bound, long before the scientific
breakthrough of the Manhattan project yielded the atomic weapon. This
book forms an enquiry into this profound interrelationship of science
and warfare. Its central claim is that throughout the modern era [[the
dominant corpus of scientific ideas has been reflected in the
contemporary theories and practices of warfare in the Western
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. From the ascendancy of the scientific
worldview in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to the present
day, an ever more intimate symbiosis between science and warfare has
established itself, with the increasing reliance on the development and
integration of technology within complex social assemblages of war.
[This extensive deployment of scientific ideas and methodologies in the
military realm allows us to speak of the constitution and perpetuation
of a scientific way of warfare. [The notion of a scientific way of
warfare seeks not merely to capture the growing role played by science
in developing and perfecting military
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} important as it has been.
Rather the primary concern here is with [[the manner in which scientific
ideas have been systematically recruited to inform thinking about the
very nature of combat]{.mark} and the forms of military organisation
best suited to prevail in it]{.underline}.

#### Thus our only choice in an era of war is to become war- to enter a state of becoming in which we constantly mobilize- a historical analysis of the world through radical empiricism teaches us to enter becoming, instead of being, and no longer are we devoured by war.

Bousquet et al 20 (Antoine Bousquet, Jairus Grove, Nisha Shah, "Becoming
War: Towards a Martial Empiricism",2020) GP

[[Martial empiricism apprehends war as a process of becoming that is
suspended between potentiality and actualit]{.mark}y]{.underline},
scrutinizing the enfolding of intensities, relations and attributes that
give rise to war's givenness. [[War's ontogenetic powers see it persist
across multiple histories and geographies while simultaneously always
being recast]{.mark}.]{.underline}4 Although a processualist philosophy
expects the sum of reality to be engaged in such becoming, war's
peculiar qualities undoubtedly express becoming's wildest and most
disruptive tendencies. In its various iterations[, [war's irruptive
possibility has unleashed the most intensive periods of invention and
transformation, tearing through carefully erected human orders,
shattering sacred idols and shredding cultural pretensions.]{.mark} [War
reminds us how little control we really have,]{.mark}]{.underline} how
easy it is to be swallowed whole and forgotten in an instant. [[War
forces a confrontation with how precarious, finite and insignificant
each of us is as a solitary, fleeting line of
becoming]{.underline}]{.mark}. Through martial empiricism, we choose
fidelity to the world and our encounter with it over fidelity to a
method or the comforting illusion that the world is reliably mechanical,
discretely rational and providentially progressive. [[Martial empiricism
is an empiricism built to embrace the generative, mutating and
world-ending character of war]{.underline}]{.mark}. It belongs to what
the anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro (2014: 105) calls 'untamed
thought', in which 'knowing is no longer a way of representing the
unknown but of interacting with it'.5 [[A radical empiricism affirms the
world as it is, not as we wish it were]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is the
empiricism that war demands -- an empiricism that is open-ended and
robust enough to bear both the generative chaos of battle and the
ever-extending tendrils of its other-than-combat activities. 104
Security Dialogue 51(2-3) [[Rather than attempting to narrowly
circumscribe it in service of prior positivist or normative commitments,
martial empiricism permits war to define itself]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Contra attempts to compartmentalize reality with unyielding definitions
of the object of study, we expect such definitions to become ever less
useful as they become more specific[[. The more assured we are that we
know what war is, that we know in advance what to measure, that those
units of measurement are isomorphic with each other, the more it will
slip between our fingers.]{.underline}]{.mark} The more confident we are
in what to look for, the less we are capable of experiencing. There is
no better example of this than the insistence by Steven Pinker (2011) or
Joshua Goldstein (2012) that war is coming to an end as they brandish
spreadsheets that purport to show the statistical decline of armed
conflict. Yet what sense is there in conducting a large-n study when
every war is its own n? To our mind, what is waning is less the
occurrence of war than the capacity of 'war accountants' to encounter
the world. [[The normative injunction to only study war through the
frame of a problem that has as its unique solution peace is no less
limiting. How can such a commitment not obscure what can be known of
war]{.underline}]{.mark}? While we are interested in becomings other
than war, we do not think we should conduct research in a padded room.
[[The provocation of war's creativity -- its more-than-human
persistence, its continuities and discontinuities -- demands theorizing
even if those lines of thought do not have happy
endings]{.underline}]{.mark}. In our formulation of martial empiricism,
we draw inspiration from the 'radical empiricism' of William James, as
well successive inheritors such as Alfred North Whitehead (1978), Gilles
Deleuze (1986, 1988, 1994), Isabelle Stengers (2010), Gilbert Simondon
(2009), Erin Manning and Brian Massumi (2014), Jane Bennett (2010),
William Connolly (2005), Karen Barad (2007) and Steven Shaviro (2014).
Writing in the early 1900s, James (1976, 1996) outlined a philosophy
decisively grounded in the fecund event of experience. It is essential
to understand that James does not propose anything like a
phenomenological reduction on the basis of a stable subject of
experience but instead affirms experience itself as prior to both its
subjects and its objects. According to Massumi's (2016: 116)
interpretation of James, 'pure experience is worlding. It is the
constitutive process of the world's emergence.' James took issue with
the rationalist philosophy of his day, charging it with a fixation on
universals and a privileging of wholes understood as prior to their
parts. His, in contrast, was to be 'a mosaic philosophy, a philosophy of
plural facts' that 'starts with the parts and makes of the whole a being
of the second order' (James, 1976: 22). This approach is an inherently
processual one, in which [['what really exists is not things made, but
things in the making']{.underline}]{.mark} (James, 1996: 117).
Accordingly[, [radical empiricism does not produce an ontology in the
sense of a hierarchy of being for the organization of
reality.]{.mark}]{.underline} As Didier Debaise (2005: 104) puts it,
'everything is taken on the same plane: ideas, propositions,
impressions, things, individuals, societies. Experience is this diffuse,
tangled ensemble of things, movements, becomings, relations, without
primary distinction, without founding principle.' From the theoretical
ground demarcated thus far, three principles of a martial empiricism
should be highlighted. First, [[martial empiricism is interested in a
world that appears as 'a fabric of interlaced, superimposed relations,
of telescoped events]{.underline}]{.mark}' (Lapoujade, 2000: 193). While
a pragmatic bounding of experience may be necessary, nothing can be
excluded a priori, no matter how morally repugnant or seemingly banal,
if we are to account for war's promiscuity. Second, like experience, war
is replete with dualisms that have to be attended to as provocations but
not accepted as natural divisions. One such instance concerns the
articulation between the supposed constancy of the general concept of
war and the perpetual mutations in its manifestations as warfare. In
reality, [[war is both a thing and a process, a unity and an assembly,
an event and an ecology of relations]{.underline}]{.mark} (Grove, 2014).
War's relations do not only bind parts into wholes at the service of
structural functionalities; they also constitute multiplicities of
difference that possess no less integrity for the contingent assembly of
their constituent elements. Third, every investigation of war explores a
different field of experience that requires a bespoke attention and
theoretical development native to that field. No Bousquet, Grove and
Shah 105 conceptualizations are ever exhaustive of reality; they are
only ever partial and contextual. [[Martial empiricism is not a theory
of war. It is a theory of the conditions of possibility for asking what
war does and means in the first place. Positing becoming over being, we
necessarily privilege novelty and difference over stability and
recurrence]{.underline}]{.mark}, with the former having to explain the
latter rather than the reverse. We also prioritize relations over
dualisms, since the world of becoming is no more split between ideas and
matter than it is between subjects and objects or structure and agency.
Everything is a transaction between the organizational character of a
particular arrangement of things and the ways in which those things make
sense of the world through that organizational character. We are all
singular blocks of becoming that are simultaneously imbricated in each
other. Similarly, we value process over causality. The investigation of
continuities in a world of becoming suggests that any causal explanation
only appears as such through a decontextualization of the transactional
processes that support it. Radical empiricism and processual ontology
imply [[that there is no rational base camp from which to set off in the
study of a process]{.underline}]{.mark} -- all research is necessarily
in media res. One always begins 'in the middle, between things,
interbeing, intermezzo' (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987: 25). [[We are
always in the middle of war, in a world already saturated with the
history, present and anticipation of war]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is
not to say that its manifestations, intensities and destructions are
evenly distributed. [[Yet no war emerges without the conspiracy of the
cosmos.]{.mark}]{.underline} The explicit and visible character of that
complicity moves each day from the abstract metaphysical to the concrete
actual as war draws into its gravitational pull polities, economies,
technologies and ideologies. [[There is no end to war's metabolic
appetite, and what it does not devour and
incorporate]{.underline}]{.mark}, it creates new from whole cloth. [[But
where do you start investigating something with no outside, no beginning
or end, no enduring substance? How do you know what to look for in the
first place if the world is a non-repeating flux?]{.underline}]{.mark}
One must necessarily hold a provisional idea of what war is in order to
begin enquiring into it. But that idea must remain fuzzy enough to
accommodate the novelty and mutability inherent in its becoming -- an
'anexact yet rigorous' conception in Deleuze and Guattari's (1987: 407)
formulation. Likewise, the more specific processual sketches to be
outlined within the empirical field of war can be thought of as
renderings of what Whitehead (1978: 86) calls 'lures'. In complexity
science, these lures are the strange attractors that draw dynamic
systems to certain recursive yet never identical patterns of behaviour,
from atmospheric flows to crowd movements. Crucially, Whitehead's lures
are emphatically not Platonic ideals imperfectly instantiated in the
world, but refer instead to 'potentials for the process of becoming'
from which concrete things or events emerge (Whitehead, 1978: 29). The
contributions to this special issue each stake their own claims and
investigative terrains through their attentiveness to how war engenders
martial life and demands new modes of empiricism equal to it. Rather
than summarizing each of the pieces, we outline below the distinct yet
overlapping domains of war's becoming that coalesce through their
collective resonance. With the ultimate aim of orienting future
research, we identify the intensive processes of war encapsulated by
mobilization, design and encounter. Mobilizing war A term that first
entered military parlance in the 1830s, mobilization denotes the ways in
which resources are conscripted, regimented and deployed into martial
worlds. Through this becomingmobile, prior attachments are cast off,
life-forms are refashioned and rearranged, wild energies are stoked,
amassed and directed. [[The particular affinity of war with speed has of
course been noted]{.underline}]{.mark} 106 Security Dialogue 51(2-3)
(Virilio, 2006). [[But it would be a mistake to focus only on the
obvious weapon systems or even the accompanying rhythms of production,
communication and exchange]{.mark}. [Different velocities are also
involved in both the galvanizing of affects --]{.mark}]{.underline}
glory, honour, animosity, all the passions without which Clausewitz
admitted war would be impossible -- and the new cadences of becoming
that transport beings in war. [[While mobilization is inherent in every
war, a broad historical intensification and deepening of its processes
has been a salient feature of modern societies.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
German veteran Ernst Jünger was probably the first to fully
conceptualize mobilization when he wrote in the 1930s of the 'growing
conversion of life into energy, the increasingly fleeting content of all
binding ties in deference to mobility', anticipating a state of total
mobilization in which 'there is no longer any movement whatsoever -- be
it that of the homeworker at her sewing machine -- without at least
indirect use for the battlefield' (Jünger, 1992: 126).6 As historical
sociologists have amply demonstrated, the unfolding of world history in
the past five hundred years is unintelligible without reference to the
tremendous development of the means of destruction that came to nest
within the nation-state and attained a new escape velocity in 1914
(Mann, 1986, 1993; Tilly, 1992). Through bouts of intense competition,
states placed their entire populations in arms, invoking homeland,
virtue or historical destiny and summoning figures of absolute enmity so
as to corral the energies that might deliver a decisive blow to the
adversary. Placing war in the 20th century under the sign of 'work', the
instrumental rationalization of life, relentless optimization and the
central role of technique, Jünger diverged above all from Karl Marx in
that he did not see capital accumulation as the mainspring of modern
societies but instead a more fundamental drive for power that found its
purest expression in the warring activity.7 Although his elevation of
war into a redemptive metaphysics outlines a black hole that a martial
empiricism should always guard against, Jünger's interventions do
emphasize the difficulties that war has always presented to an orthodox
Marxism that would resort to a crude economism to account for it. Other
thinkers, such as Georges Bataille (1988), J. F. C. Fuller (1998), and
Deleuze and Guattari (1987), have produced 'general economies' of war
that attend to a wider field of investments, exchanges and expenditures
and should accordingly retain our attention (see Meiches on Bataille,
2020). [[Just as war cannot be apprehended solely through its
instrumental appropriations, a lucid understanding of human societies
cannot treat war as merely a peripheral or derivative phenomenon.8
Moreover, it would be misguided to believe ourselves beyond the era of
total mobilization.]{.underline}]{.mark} Entire nations may no longer
face the likely prospect of being in arms strictly speaking, but the
annihilatory powers amassed by them still indefinitely hang over us in
the guise of a thermonuclear sword of Damocles[. [States of war and
peace, civilian and military spheres, blur ever more in the unrelenting
age of globalized targeting, counterinsurgency]{.mark}]{.underline},
criss-crossing circuits of innovation from MIT (Massachusetts Institute
of Technology) to Silicon Valley to DARPA (The Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency), and the intensifying societal securitization to which
we affixed the now almost quaint denomination of 'war on terror'. As for
the key mobilizing activity of logistics so central to the global
capitalist economy, it not only originates in the conduct of warfare
(Cowen, 2014) but is now so prominent within it that Paul Virilio
affirms, somewhat hyperbolically, that it has 'become the whole of war'
(Virilio and Lotringer, 2008: 103). [[We thus take one of the tasks of
martial empiricism to be to investigate the historical escalation and
proliferation of mobilization, to trace the ebbs and flows of its
extensions and intensities in the various fields into which it has been
invested.]{.underline}]{.mark} Attention must here be directed as much
to its overarching frames of intelligibility as to the minutiae of its
micropolitical practices (Öberg, 2020). The particular marshalling of
the human body, in its somatic, cognitive and affective capacities, is
here paramount. Be it via the psychomotricity of the musculoskeletal
frame and its nervous system of reflexes, perceptual and neurocognitive
faculties, or the affective states of anger, fear and Bousquet, Grove
and Shah 107 communal bonding, the human organism has been
comprehensively enlisted into the war machine (McSorley, 2020). The
age-old conduct of military training for instilling discipline and
esprit de corps in the new recruit is certainly paradigmatic, with drill
exercises persisting today as a chief ritual through which individuals
are integrated into the ranks of military organizations (Foucault, 1995;
McNeill, 1995). Yet, if repetitive drill and docile obedience to
hierarchical command remain valued, late modern military institutions
with organizational cultures that increasingly resemble those of their
civilian counterparts are also today less prone to rely on nakedly
authoritarian means to ensure individual compliance and dependability
(Howell, 2015; Moskos et al., 2000). The 'anatomo-politics of the human
body' have deepened considerably since their incipience in the
disciplinary techniques of the 17th century (Foucault, 1990: 139). The
capillary microphysics of military power extend themselves ever further
through the fields of biochemistry, neuropsychology, pharmacology and
genetics (Coker, 2013; Krishnan, 2016). Military weaponry and equipment
are no less important in soliciting, orienting and steering the human
agent, their design guided by principles of 'human systems integration'
into the war machine (Pew and Mavor, 2007). The methods employed for the
purpose of mobilization vary, but their core objective remains constant:
to augment the individual's contribution to assembled combat power and
ward off the thresholds beyond which the compound effects of stress,
pain and fatigue induce its degradation and eventual collapse (Kinsella,
2020). Indeed, among all the spheres of human activity, it is plausibly
within that of armed conflict that the previously established limits of
the body are most persistently and spectacularly breached. Borrowing the
Spinozist cry vocalized by Gilles Deleuze (1988: 17), we can exclaim:
'we do not even know what a martial body can do!' None of the above
should imply an overly restrictive or monolithic conception of
mobilization. For one thing, the purview of mobilization is evidently
not restricted to the statist institutions that have otherwise advanced
its techniques to their highest point. It encompasses, for instance, the
combustive chain reaction of (self-)radicalization undergone by jihadis
or white nationalists in their becoming-war, along with the specific
roles played by ideological conversion, catalytic peer groups,
paramilitary training, and the administration of steroids or
amphetamines. Informal banking networks and internet crowdfunding
platforms likewise support modes of martial patronage, incitement and
entrepreneurialism that bypass the state form (Grove, 2019). No less
important are the oppositions, subversions and surfeits that the
solicitations of the war machine encounter everywhere. We find among
these open resistances to the headlong rush to war as well as small,
concealed and repeated acts of disobedience and denial. Conversely,
there is the fierce indocility of the very energies stoked by
mobilization, which are by their very nature uncompliant in their
expressions. For [[war is a domain of transgression and excess that
never fully reconciles with the governmental imperatives of utility,
calculus and restraint]{.underline}]{.mark} (Meiches, 2020). Deleuze and
Guattari (1987: 358) thus invoke the 'fundamental indiscipline of the
warrior' waging a struggle against the forces that would pare them down
to an instrumental function. The study of mobilization must therefore
also include all that resists, disobeys and exceeds its injunctions
(Lisle, 2020). Finally, as MacLeish (2020) so poignantly reminds us,
processes of demobilization and the smouldering remainders and
abominable residues left in the aftermath of war are no less worthy of
our consideration.

#### We turn war into models in every debate, our impacts are our enemies, and we plan carefully the precise tactics needed to eliminate them. This schematization is an effort not to fix the ends but to solely engage with the means themselves- we try to make war into a knowable moment but only end up sanitizing war, killing becomes justified as precise, understandable, and clean thus rationalizing all violence and legitimizing it. The more we try to know war the more war will know us.

Bousquet et al 20 (Antoine Bousquet, Jairus Grove, Nisha Shah, "Becoming
War: Towards a Martial Empiricism",2020) GP

[[If mobilization addresses the marshalling of resources -- bodies,
affects and materiel -- towards violent ends, we propose design as the
frame by which to investigate the concretization of war's
means]{.underline}]{.mark} -- or what is generally referred to as
warfare. Given its realization in destructive techniques and tools for
the purpose of obliterating life and the will to resist with maximum
efficiency, the philosophical shadow cast over the activity of design
renders it a particularly apposite concept. 108 Security Dialogue
51(2-3) Indeed, as Singleton (2011) shows[, [design has always been
associated with deviousness and duplicity, a realm of schemes, plots and
contrivances, where craft is synonymous with
craftiness]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recovering the specific 'cunning
intelligence' known to the ancient Greeks as metis, Detienne and Vernant
(1991: 47) highlight those 'activities in which man \[sic\] must learn
to manipulate hostile forces too powerful to be controlled directly but
which can be exploited despite themselves'. Alongside the machinations
against nature that 'give craftsmen their control over material which is
always more or less intractable to their designs', they identify '[[the
stratagems used by the warrior the success of whose attack hinges on
surprise, trickery or ambush']{.underline}]{.mark} (Detienne and
Vernant, 1991: 47--48). [[Characterized by remarkable, wicked feats of
technical and tactical ingenuity and decisively shaped by existential
confrontation with an enemy that must be outwitted
--]{.underline}]{.mark} if necessary, by means of trickery and deception
-- [[war is arguably the field of human activity that most accords with
the conspiratorial spirit of design]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
provocation of 'war by design' is inspired by Simone Weil's (1987: 241)
insistence that 'the most defective method possible' for apprehending
war is 'in terms of the ends pursued, and not by the nature of the means
employed'. [[Armed conflicts cannot be reduced to the political
motivations or moral justifications that legitimate them.]{.mark} [Ends
are pursued with specific means, generating war as a particular kind of
force.]{.mark}]{.underline} Little, therefore, can be gleaned or done
about war without 'having first of all taken apart the mechanism of the
military struggle' (Weil, 1987: 241). Grégoire Chamayou (2015)
accordingly calls for 'political technicians' to uncover and expose
war's core operations in all their intelligibility and compulsion.
Indeed, in grasping the functioning of an actual device, the technical
study of war can 'discover the implications of how it works for the
action that it implements' (Chamayou, 2015: 15). Attention is thereby
directed towards war's mechanisms and the apparatuses through which
warfare is assembled and executed. [[Design implies a remit much broader
than the obvious instruments of warfare, such as weapons or other such
material objects inserted in the wider machinations of war. Nor can
design be confined to formal military institutions and their associated
research-and-development complexes,]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly in
an age of proliferating 'dual-use' technologies, improvised explosive
devices (IEDs), 3D-printed firearms, dark-web supply chains,
cyberhacking and paramilitary swarm tactics. Rather[[, a focus on the
instrumentality of warfare should be broadened to 'the ways in which the
art of war -- its tools, its tactics and its tenor -- is generated and
governed']{.underline}]{.mark} (Shah, 2017: 90). To this end, [[design
allows war to be 'glimpsed in action']{.underline}]{.mark} (Singleton,
2011: 5) in the concatenation of actors, objects and operations that are
not just implicated in but generative of a 'savage ecology' (Grove,
2019[[). A focus on design pries open the concrete activities of
organized violence, revealing how they cohere and combine to make
certain forms of war possible or impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Attention is brought to contours (the spaces and objects that delineate
the stage within which war is set) and repertoires (the registers of
permissible actions that can be performed), revealing how form and
function are implied in one another in schemes, signatures and
subterfuges[. [At a first pass, the schemes of war can be recognized
within the tactical directives, operational procedures and strategic
manoeuvres that animate military organizations]{.mark}]{.underline} and
are subject to continuous reflexive exercises.9 [[More fundamentally
still, schemes can be thought of as schematics, diagrams of operation
through which bodies, implements and terrains are arranged into
apparatuses of war]{.underline}]{.mark}. While all these various
elements may not have been designed from the outset to serve war, as
they fall within its ambit they acquire new martial functions, all the
while exerting their own respective influences on the resulting
ensembles. One can evoke here the human--spear--shield assemblage of the
Nguni warrior, the human--stirrup--horse of cavalry, or the
human--radio--rifle of the modern platoon, in their various tactical
deployments (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987; Protevi, 2013). Denman (2020)
addresses the architectural topographies of war, a history encompassing
rudimentary earthworks, Vauban's geometric fortifications and today's
wider enlistment of the Bousquet, Grove and Shah 109 built environment,
all of which exist in relation to topologies of terrain and territory
(see also Elden, 2013; Hirst, 2005; Scott, 2016; Weizman, 2007[). [As
diagrams of power (]{.mark}Deleuze, 1986), [schemes should not be viewed
in terms of mere technical exercises]{.mark}, [which is how their own
designers are frequently prone to regarding them, but as micropolitical
activities]{.mark} [through which forms of warfare are summoned,
conducted, reproduced and even anticipated]{.mark}]{.underline} (Öberg,
2020). Every war has its signature features. These range from the
fashioned characteristics of its infrastructure, weaponry and soldiers
to the more emergent traits of its collisions, injuries and
devastations. All are subject to attempts at calibrating them, with the
resulting expressions of armed conflict the product of intentional
design's encounter with both wilful resistance and recalcitrant
reality.10 [[At stake is not merely the optimal allocation of limited
resources towards instrumental ends but also the legitimation of the act
of killing through conformity with established norms or
laws]{.underline}]{.mark}. A firearm must efficiently convert a
thermodynamic explosion into directed lethality, yet it must also not
result in injury that is superfluous or unnecessary (Ford, 2019; Shah,
2017). [[The dead body is not just the net outcome of a direct hit, but
an ideal, the pursuit of a legitimate kind of killing through the effect
of military engineering, scientific experimentation and medical
observation under legal and moral judgement.]{.mark} [Attending to such
details as the calibre of bullets is thus not a way of sanitizing the
study of war from its deadly effects but, on the contrary, a means to
understanding how those effects are 'standardized' within the military
repertoire]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dittmer, 2017). More broadly,
standardization alludes to the broader role of protocol in warfare,
ranging from seemingly mundane quotidian routines or sartorial
requirements to the standard operating procedures by which lethal
violence is executed (Monk, 2020). In each of these instances, specific
protocols impart on war particular styles that cannot be apprehended
solely by reference to instrumental designs but are also necessarily
expressive of a particular aesthetic or ethos (Meiches, 2017). Finally,
[[war is the realm of subterfuge]{.underline}]{.mark}. Returning to the
roots of design in deception and trickery, we recall that war is
conducted through an encounter with an opposing force that must be
anticipated and negated. As Lisle's study of bomb disposal robots
illustrates (2020), advanced militaries are prone to losing sight of
this, obsessed with optimizing their own processes and perfecting their
technologies, but are invariably reminded of it, not least because it is
the principal way by which they are foiled by supposedly inferior
adversaries. Throughout the ages, belligerents have devised countless
stratagems towards the dissimulation of their presence, movements and
intentions, as well as the proactive disinformation and misdirection of
their antagonists. The particular instantiations of these can be found
in the various techniques of camouflage, stealth, disguise, decoy and
deception that populate the history of war (Bousquet, 2018). The more
general figure here is that of the trap, laid to lure the target by
exploiting its habits and proclivities so as to ensnare it in a
situation in which its strengths can be offset or even turned against
itself. Chamayou (2012) has coined the term 'cynegetics' to denote the
kinship between war and hunting -- the predatory character of power
counterposed to the commonly inherited image of pastoral care under
biopolitics[[. War is a hunt, the pursuit of another that can hunt you
back]{.mark}. Last but not least, [with etymological roots in the Latin
for 'flight', subterfuge also hints at the elusive becoming of war that
no snare can ever wholly capture, however carefully
designed]{.mark}.]{.underline} Encountering war Through the
mobilizations and designs of armed force, [[martial empiricism leads us
ultimately to the encounter with war understood at its paroxysm as the
fulminant meeting of hostile forces, the searing immersion into its
experiential crucible.]{.mark} [The forces of becoming are at their most
unbridled here in their forbidding convulsions of intertwined
destruction and creation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Events are permeated with
contingency and unpredictability, or that which Clausewitz referred to
as the ineradicable 110 Security Dialogue 51(2-3) element of 'chance' in
war. At ground level, [t[he encounter with war directs us to its very
sensate experience. After all, war is equally waged by the
senses]{.mark}]{.underline} (the weapon as extension of the eye),
[[through the senses]{.underline}]{.mark} (its surfeit of sensations
ranging from excruciating pain to sublime exaltation) [[and on the
senses]{.underline}]{.mark} (the blinding, bewildering and enervation of
perception). We take inspiration from Michel Serres (2016), who opens
his book on the senses with a recollection of his time in the French
Navy. Through extensive fire training on his ship, he learns to breathe
in smoky rooms, crawl through cramped, dark, crowded tunnels and
navigate his surroundings using only his sense of touch. [[Yet all of
this knowledge remains 'academic' until the moment an actual fire
declares itself in the vessel's hull.]{.mark} [Upon hearing the
munitions on the ship detonate, he realizes his only chance for survival
is to push through a small, rusty porthole. The moment of theoretical
illumination comes as he finds himself stuck in the porthole, staring
out at a glacial sea with his back exposed to the searing flames, one
half of his body freezing while the other is burning]{.mark}. Serres
(2016: 19) writes, ['I was inside, I was outside. Who was this "I"?' In
that instant, the 'I' became a body that 'proclaims, calls, announces,
sometimes howls the I like a wounded animal'.]{.mark}]{.underline} In
that moment of desperation, the body fissures, another 'I' emerges, not
the 'I' of the cogito but that of pure experience. The confrontation
with existential peril is for Serres not just one more experience among
others collected and indexed by a persistent 'I' but one that forges an
altogether new 'I' from within it. The subject revealed during those
fateful minutes resonates with James's counter-intuitive claim that we
are, in each fleeting moment, nothing more than a bundle of experience
in the flux of becoming. In the moment of pain and crisis, the
disjunctive character of Serres's legs, arms, torso, head and sensations
dismembers Kant's supposed 'spontaneous accord of the faculties'. What
Serres learnt that day is that there is nothing spontaneous or necessary
about the habituated accord of the faculties. The faculties and our
sense of self are, like everything else, transitory coalescences drawn
from the stream of experience. [[Cardinal as it may be, the encounter
with war does not reduce to the conflagration of battle but encompasses
a multiplicity of locales, durations and affects. War is diversely
experienced by its participants as a cacophony of
fear]{.underline}]{.mark}, anxiety, love, grief, rage, boredom,
reminiscence, longing and elation, [[to which sleep offers merely a
temporary respite]{.underline}]{.mark} (Kinsella, 2020). Many soldiers
describe missing war and its unparalleled heightening of human
existence, but all wrestle with its fundamental unintelligibility and
foreignness, one way or another. In Michael Herr's (1991) Dispatches
from the Vietnam War, war appears as a kind of collective insanity in
which soldiers struggle to make sense of the absurd situations the
designs of war have placed them in. William Spanos (1993) notes that the
entire Vietnamese earth came to be experienced as hostile by US
soldiers. These soldiers could feel the enmity of trees, mosquitos,
humidity, shadows and small children. [[What is it to feel enmity as
opposed to merely acquiescing to its legal declaration or semiotic
identification by official uniforms]{.mark}? [The realm of feeling in
war in all its complexities and gradations is one that has still
received insufficient attention in our disciplines]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The study of war experience goes well beyond collecting and relaying the
combat testimonies or personal narratives of participants, however.
Navigating the field of martial experience demands close attention to
the depersonalizing shock of pure experience, the complex interactions
between various affects, and the modes of intelligibility that attempt
to make sense of and commandeer those affects. Through his enquiry into
affective excess in total war, Ben Anderson (2010: 168) enjoins us to
move beyond an amorphous general category of affect to understand how
specific affects are 'imbricated with mutable and variable modes of
power that differ in their targets, desired and actual outcomes, hinges,
and spatial [[forms'. Attending to the sensory and affective dimensions
of war requires inspecting both the battlescapes in which combat occurs
and all the other spaces in which bodies are primed and conditioned for
fighting in the first place]{.underline}]{.mark}. Kinsella's
contribution (2020) on the regulation of sleep in war and the successes
and failures of military interventions in Bousquet, Grove and Shah 111
the governance of slumber is exemplary. To consider sleep or its
privation as part of the formative milieu of war draws us to the rhythms
and processes of the body that both set the stage for martial experience
and themselves constitute sites of power and contestation. In turn,
Kirby's unsettling investigation into sexual violence (2020) troubles
our understandings of corporeal investments and mobilizations in the
most intimate and traumatic of encounters. The supple affective terrain
of experience certainly has not escaped the cunning intelligence of war.
Tactics of 'shock and awe' and campaigns to 'win hearts and minds' seek
to modulate the experience of war to produce specific outcomes. Bombs
and bullets are made to persuade, convert and inspire as much as to kill
and destroy. Peter Sloterdijk (2011) refers to the invasive ecology of
warfare -- [[the targeting of the material and immaterial connective
tissues of our life-worlds -- as 'atmoterrorism'. From this perspective,
the progress of war is nothing less than the ceaseless search for 'new
surfaces of vulnerability']{.mark} (Sloterdijk, 2011: 28), from
breathable air and drinkable water to ideological beliefs and
psychological states. For Massumi (2015), [colour-coded terror levels,
mutual assured destruction, and IEDs all trade on the volatile stock
market of affective intensities that are no less real for their ethereal
character. Atmospheres of war that extend far beyond the identifiable
physicality of conflict are always enveloping us.]{.mark}]{.underline}
By virtue of violence's 'super-empirical' character -- its immaterial
affective charge -- a witness can be 'struck by the performed remainder
of force as certainly as the recipient of the blow' (Massumi, 2015: 87).
[[Violence does not reduce to the infliction of broken bodies and
bleeding wounds. War cuts deeper. It is through the affective
register]{.mark} [that scholars]{.mark} like McSorley (2012) or Daggett
(2015) [are able to convey the militarized sensorium of helmetcams or
the queering embodiments of drone interfaces]{.mark}.]{.underline} Gun
sights, night-vision goggles and drone cameras are not so much
perceptual extensions to pre-existing subjects as interpolations into
the flux of deterritorialized affect from which martial subjectivities
emerge. From such points of entry, the primary stuff of war increasingly
appears less like an assortment of weapons, drilled bodies and
formations than, as per McSorley's olfactory exploration (2020), a
synesthetic congerie of visions, sounds, smells, touches, memories and
emotions. The question here is not so much how to make sense of war as
how war makes the senses. Accordingly, [[the apprehension of war's
encounter cannot limit itself to an interpretation of its
representations.]{.underline}]{.mark} Through MacLeish's engagement with
the veteran life (2020), we learn that experience exceeds the
immediately physical and yet retains a real effectivity on the world
over and above the meanings invested in its representations. Even if
they cannot be discerned in the discrete, continuous space of the
material world, affective intensities overflow any representation we can
make of them. The capture of the flux of experience through the media of
language, paper, film, museums and monuments has no privilege over scar
tissue, synaptic patterns, social relations and the planet's epidermis.
[[Martial empiricism is no more a naive realism in which everything is
directly observable and measurable than it is an endless hermeneutics
through which the world is made subservient to our interpretations of
it.]{.mark} [In war, through war, beyond war, the tumult of conflict
periodically unsettles and shatters the reality principle of our
understandings]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than call the participants
of war that undergo such journeys 'unreliable' witnesses or 'unstable'
subjects, we would rather redirect these seismic shifts in perspective
onto the myth of recurrent experience. While not its sole privilege, war
surely presents an inordinate challenge to the normalization of first
world, suburban, sheltered experience, in which repetition and sameness
are mistaken for a given principle or norm of both daily existence and
scholarly investigation rather than the prerogative of particular
dwellings. Yet we have now become painfully aware that city centres and
public transportation are everywhere liable to precipitously transmute
into sites of carnage that strike at beings in their most quotidian
existences. Concurrently, drone pilots in the heart of the Nevada
suburbs commute home through rows of box 112 Security Dialogue 51(2-3)
stores, returning to their families after putting in a shift hunting men
across the rocky terrains of Waziristan. [[The humdrum domesticity of
the everyday coexists with the systemic unleashing of deadly
force.]{.underline}]{.mark} Rather than pick a side between thinkers
like Veena Das (2007), who underlines the ordinariness of violence, and
Adriana Cavarero (2009), who demands that we confront the 'horrorism' of
our contemporary atrocities, [[we position martial empiricism in the
interval between the normality and the pathology of
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. Following this lead highlights how war
choreographs the transitions from one field of consistent experience to
another, and how the accompanying disruptions congeal into new
consistencies. How else can we make sense of the forever and everywhere
wars of the 21st century (Filkins, 2008; Gregory, 2011) and the
lacerations of remote force projection and pop-up guerrillas that
punctually erupt across the globe? [[An empirical account of war
organized by sensuous experience leads us back to the 'great outdoors'
of Levinas's opening provocation]{.underline}]{.mark} -- war at the
crossroads of totality and boundless alterity. However, the other of
war, contra Levinas, is not just the problem of other human minds.
Consciousness indeterminably bleeds into other forms of life,
distributed among animals and machines -- the horses, dogs, pigeons or
dolphins of war, their biomimetic counterparts, and other algorithmic
presences (Cudworth and Hobden, 2015). We already have phenomenological
accounts surveying the umwelts of drone operators and their targets
(Daggett 2015; Holmqvist, 2013[). [New frontiers lie beyond in the
burgeoning inner lives of our machines and their otherworldly
experiences of us. Grounding our study in a speculative and radical
account of experience entails an openness to varieties of martial
experience that outstrip our imaginations or
predictions]{.mark}]{.underline}. War continually struggles to become
conscious of itself. If unbridled deregulation of the senses and
emergent subjectivities are inherent in war, how are we to realize a
philosophical engagement with war? It is not enough to say that
philosophical thought should interpret or represent war for us. We are
not, in the final instance, interested in a theory of war but in how war
provokes thought itself. For the frame of encounter necessarily pushes
us deeper into the question of what holds war together. War is no more
reducible to the litany of entities that make it up -- from bullets,
bombs and bandages to battlefields, bodies and battalions -- than it is
to an unmediated exertion of political will. The promiscuous relations
of parts to wholes are an essential research problem, but their
apprehension is inchoate without the stream of consciousness that
experiences war. The empiricism pursued here -- with its emphasis on
affect, embodiment and sensation -- is a martial empiricism because it
is forged in the very crucible of war. Rather than being merely the
agent provocateur of some other line of thought, war is permitted to be
its own site of inquiry and theoretical elaboration.

#### Thus to become war we must affirm war- only an affective switch out of the squo creates the opportunity for bifurcation.

Not so, [[becoming war is a suspended present]{.underline}]{.mark}. Like
the bullet time of The Matrix in which the incredible speed of moment
produces an interminable slowness there must a 219 moment of duration
just before war that makes possible no-war. [[To understand war as a
becoming is not only lay bare the facile and destitute liberal
understanding of peace but to open exploration of a becoming otherwise
than war.]{.mark} [Such a becoming cannot be peace and is apt to be
illegible to the current indexes of war and peace.]{.mark}]{.underline}
The normative markers of peace---the absence of conflict---need not
define the limit of possible becomings otherwise than war. Becoming
agonistic, becoming active, becoming rage, becoming justice, becoming
quiet, becoming still, becoming disobedient, becoming graceful, becoming
kind, becoming indifferent, becoming defiant, becoming gentle, becoming
sacrifice, becoming fire (as many monks in Vietnam did and at least
three individuals in the US have in the face of the Iraq war), becoming
generous, becoming courageous\... [[The restoration of belief in the

repressive model of peace.]{.mark} [We must reject the model of peace
exemplified by peacekeeping. War cannot be
restrained]{.mark}]{.underline}, repressed, or deferred. The return of
the repressed is often the outcome of managerial practices of peace. To
approach peace of this kind is to translate war into standing
reserve---saved up, stockpiled, trained, honed, targeted, scenario
planned. Each model of peace defines a pole of international politics.
One can see at the heart of the attempt to distinguish peace from war
the absurdity of deterrence or hegemony. After all, peace is a funny way
to characterize either the nuclear threat of the United States---the
only country to use an atomic weapon---or the racial division of Israel
and Palestine watched over by the Blue Helmets of the UN[. [War cannot
be disowned or expelled It must be diverted by other incipient
becomings.]{.mark} [Other forks must be taken]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
moment just before war must be extended and 220 inhabited so such that
the otherwise becomes apparent. This does not require that the world
slow down. It might require that we unblock certain flows corralled by
the aborescent strategies of fortress state craft. [[Redirecting the
affective economies of war towards other
attachments---]{.underline}]{.mark}arguments, justice, compassion,

recipe for ressentiment]{.underline}]{.mark}. In refugee camps,
detention camps, on either sides of walled borders, identities assert
themselves, harden and intensify. The wasteland grows. War cannot be
disavowed or expelled as in the Kantian tradition. [[Only the
affirmative has the power to make the otherwise
possible.]{.underline}]{.mark} The seeming intolerability of affirming
destitution, battle, conflict, violence as part of life---a becoming of
the body--- brings into focus the possibility of becoming otherwise than
war. War is most present, most under our jurisdiction when it is part of
us rather than exterior or external to us. [[To understand the process
of becoming war is to understand the possibility of becoming something
else.]{.underline}]{.mark} If we externalize or banish war to the place
of evil or outside we lose our grasp on its most vital, generative
lifeline: ourselves. Affirming war as being human, all to human brings
into focus the subtle changes in ourselves that draw us to the moments
between war and otherwise than war. In this moment---returned to us by a
kind of attunement---we find the other practices, bodily dispositions,
emotions: grief rather than rage, compassion rather than revenge,
determination rather than resignation. For some the otherwise will only
give contrast to the power of hate or rage to overcome other impulses,
but in others it may spawn other directions; new questions, alternatives
to the dissatisfaction or burn out from rage, hate, and revenge. 221
Desperation may not always lead to the same result if returned to a fork
in the stream of becoming rather than the inevitable requirements of the
stultified responses of bombing, killing, starving, incarcerating,
deterring, sanctioning, hating[[. New machines can be released into an
assemblage, new cutting edges, new transfigurations and
modifications---metamorphoses]{.underline}]{.mark}. Something
imperceptible to the liberal eye that sees war as contrary to human
nature and imperceptible to the Realist eye that sees war as the tragic
inevitability of human nature. Each is a commitment to the human as
being rather than becoming. Each fails to see possibilities contained in
a body that evolves and carries potential to continue evolving. This is
how we should read Nietzsche\'s aphorism that to deny war is to deny
biology, to deny evolution. It is not as Fascists and those that dismiss
Nietzsche as Fascist (these two schools of thinkers being in agreement.
It is telling that Richard Wolin and Adolf Hitler read Nietzsche the
same way, badly, violently) would read this aphorism that war is
necessary and inevitable, but that war is the result of subtle,
contingent, not inevitable, selections. When one blurs or confounds the
culture/nature divide, as Jane Bennett, Alfred North Whitehead, William
E. Connolly, Henri Bergson, Manuel DeLanda Brian Goodwin and others have
(the list grows longer each day), one discerns the practices that give
rise to tendencies such of war. And one also sees the subtle
possibilities of selecting other tendencies, other practices, and other
dispositions. [[This view of Evolution is not determinism. It is the

change.]{.underline}]{.mark} Each modification confronting the

speech, some fall flat on their face and others 222 produce sonnets. But
at each moment of modification time forks, slows to a near halt, like a
drop of water just before it separates from its source. In complexity
theory such a moment is called a bifurcation. Delanda explains:
Futhermore, even if we are destined to follow the attractors guiding our
dynamical behavior, there are also bifurcations, critical points at
which we may be able to change our destiny (that is modify our long-term
tendencies). And because minuscule fluctuations in the environment in
which bifurcations occur may decide the exact nature of the resulting
attractors, on can hardly conclude that all actions we undertake---as
individuals or collectively---are irrelevant in the face of these
deterministic forces. Bifurcations may not be a \"guarantee of
freedom,\" but they certainly do provide a means of experimenting
with---and perhaps even modifying our destinies.347 [[For those attuned

### Cap answers

#### Martial politics supersedes cap 

Grove 19, (Jairus Grove, Savage Ecology, 2019, Jairus Victor Grove is

By turning Clausewitz's words inside out, what we are left with is
little more than war as an instrument; it is just that now war is waged
on more fronts, both internal and external. This does nothing to
complicate the concept of war. J. F. C. Fuller's materialist account of
the slugfest between what he calls the constant tactical factor and the
quantity theory of war comes to a similar conclusion as Foucault, but
the inversion of Clausewitz and the targeting of whole populations
provokes an image quite dif­ferent from that of biopolitics. Instead,
quoting Fuller from 1942: "[[War ceasing to be a struggle between life
values becomes a blind destructive force, like an earthquake, a volcanic
eruption or a typhoon. Whole populations are now attacked, wiped out,
enslaved or herded from one country into another like cattle]{.mark}. .
. . [the entire life of the enemy state comes to be the object of
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}." Fuller continues quoting Ely Culbertson,
"From time immemorial, men fought against men, and weapons were but
accessories[[; in this and in future wars, machines fight From
Exhaustion to Annihilation]{.underline}]{.mark}---105 against machines
and men are all but auxiliaries . . . [[engines of destruction which
devour their substance.]{.underline}]{.mark}95 This process occurs
because war is an assembly of things set in motion and held together by
the racial refrain of settler colonization, [[the imperial and
postimperial transforms territory into operational space, and, as an
assemblage, war is also transformed by those mutations and
expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}s. Following the ecological account
developed in the last chapter, [[war is not a tool of the state or a
failure of order. War is a phylum of organizing principles, refrains,
and protocols unto itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. War drags along with it
the whole of the population---its vitality, industry, inventiveness,
movement, rhythm, and affect---and attests to the human and nonhuman
character of the population and violently metabolizes other forms of
life in its path. If we want to call war biopolitical, then bios must
extend beyond the human and certainly the thin European conception of
humanism, and even the nonhuman animal, into the creative anime of all
things, and into the formative and energetic forces of war from its
beginnings. Mass war was set loose by the French Revolution's levée en
masse as much as it was made possible by gunpowder, supply lines, radio,
interchangeable parts, mass production, and the increasing speed and
efficiency of transportation and communication of information, whether
linguistic or otherwise, as well as new terrains of racialized enmity.
All these feedbacks point to a milieu or ecology of war that, while
overlapping with the market or the epistemophilia of nineteenth-century
humanizing sciences, lured these assemblages into connection at least as
much as Foucault's account of late capitalism or humanist
governmentality. Therefore, [[the constant tactical factor---war as
mutative creativity---is not just an axiomatic or abstract machine of
war. It is a global abstract machine traversing the war/nonwar
divide;]{.underline}]{.mark} war individuates specific forms of life.
Hence, we can talk about warlike relations and governance as a martial
logic without having to find combat present in either of these
conceptual expansions. This statement would seem consistent with those
inspired by Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, who seek to supplement
Foucault by rebranding the global system an empire. However, while Negri
describes the veritable deterritorialization of war, politics, economy,
and life, he too quickly subsumes these deterritorializations under the
logic of capitalism. For him, war is little more than a supplement or
effect of capital: "War seems the only possible solution. . . . With the
disappearance of the internal criteria that allow that self-regulation
and self-valorization of development, it is the violence of the
strongest that creates the norm. . . . it guarantees the smooth running
106---Chapter 3 of society and widens the terms of the market."96 This
is too simplistic, and perhaps this formulation should also be flipped
on its head. [[War ought to be seen from the other side too as a martial
machine with capitalist biopolitical effects, not just a capitalist
axiomatic with martial effects. This would shift the emphasis from an
anthropocentric preoccupation with human "states of emergency" or
sovereign states of exception,]{.underline}]{.mark} or market failure,
to the emergence of material assemblages that amplify human events such
that they reverberate throughout the assembly of things. Within the
analytic frame of capitalism, the microbial devastation of the Americas
as well as the subsequent annihilation of forms of life would be
incidental to the project of expansion rather than at their core. As a
matter of historical development[, the industrialization of war preceded
the industrialization of civilian factories.]{.underline} The two most
important components of industrialization---interchangeable parts and
the assembly line---were developed because of the demands of larger and
larger armies, not larger and larger civilian markets. Furthermore, the
demand for American industrialization was not the result of an
"invisible hand" but a directive of the War Department to create
operations for arms production using interchangeable parts.
Congressional funding for the directive resulted in a number of
inventors competing for government contracts to mass-produce weapons
that could be repaired more easily in the field. The winner, Thomas
Blanchard, developed the technology for mass production that
reverberated across the Atlantic, inspiring the images of cams featured
in Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Denis Diderot's Encyclopédie. The
invention was Blanchard's conceptual change that allowed cams to turn
irregular forms. These early lathes developed by Blanchard inspired a
wave of production mechanization in the United States and Europe. But
Blanchard's contract for the new lathes was exclusively with the
Springfield Armory and only later was made available on the market for
private factories. According to David Hounshell, the two main currents
of American industrialization flowed from the Springfield armory system,
and "the idea of uniformity or interchangeable parts was combined with
the notion that machines could make things as good and as fast as man's
hands, or even better."97 The aleatory milieu of war has its own
efficacy independent of the logic of markets and modes of production and
should be given its due. [[Despite the temptation to use capitalism as
an explanatory logic for violence, the ecology of warfare as a martial
logic exceeds the instrumentality of the market and profit drive of the
market]{.mark}.]{.underline} Furthermore, the overem- From Exhaustion to
Annihilation---107 phasis on capitalism and the provincial image of the
European battlefield also complicate the more recent development of the
global civil war theses found in Carlo Galli's Political Spaces and
Global War and Tiqqun's Introduction to Civil War that, similar to Hardt
and Negri, derive from Foucault's account of biopolitics.98 The
civil-martial divide prescripted in the move to say all war is now civil
war requires that the civil peace that foregrounds classical war assumed
by Foucault has ever existed in the first place. The accounts of
McNeill, Fuller, Braudel, and Mumford as well as the historical record
of martial development in the Americas suggest that the divide between
the civil and the martial is a convenient fiction not unlike the state
of nature. And insofar as the claim to an internal civic space (the zone
of policing rather than war) can be made, it is in a very limited
capacity and one entirely idiosyncratic of a very narrow temporal and
geographic slice of Western Europe basically between the Treaty of
Westphalia (1648) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803--15)---but again only if
we ignore the globalization of warfare happening outside this narrow
territorial limit from 1492 forward. From the larger historical and
geographical vantage point, there is no classical period before the
global civil war once the Europeanization of the globe began. From the
beginning of European expansion, war was neither interior nor exterior,
as the territory was in some sense a smooth space in that it had not
been nationalized, much less internationalized. War took place, but it
lacked the political quality that makes Foucault's inversion possible.
As such, the laws of war found in Hugo Grotius and early discussions of
Christian traditions of just war were flagrantly disregarded, just as
they had been in the European Crusades. And furthermore,
[[decolonization does not return us to the romantic image of
international politics]{.mark} either. [In the aftermath of formal-legal
colonization, everything is nationalized but virtually none of the new
national spaces resembles what could be called a sovereign
territory]{.mark}]{.underline} except for those spaces that cannot be
fully decolonized because they are settler colonies.

#### Only the perm solves---no one system of power can be extracted from the Eurocene. The alt alone fails.

I am not suggesting that Crutzen and others are part of a vast
conspiracy; rather, I want to outline how [**climate change, species
loss, slavery, the elimination of native peoples, and the globalization
of extractive capitalism are all part of the same global
ordering**.]{.underline} That is, [all of these crises are geopolitical.
The particular geopolitical arrangement of ]{.underline}what others have
called the longue durée, and what I am calling [the Eurocene, is
geologically significant but is not universally part of "human activity"
despite the false syllogism at the heart of popular ecological thinking
that a global threat to humanity must be shared in cause and crisis by
all of humanity]{.underline}.11 Departing from Sloterdijk, I am hesitant
to so easily locate modernity or explication as the root or cause of the
global catastrophe. **[No single strategy, war, act of colonization,
technological breakthrough, or worldview fully explains the apocalypse
before us]{.underline}**. However, [there is something like what Gilles
Deleuze and Félix Guattari call a refrain that holds the vast assemblage
together, a geopolitical melody hummed along with the global expansion
of a form of life characterized by homogenization rather than
diversification.]{.underline} Accordingly, [if we are to make some sense
of such a vast world that is]{.underline}, even for Crutzen and
Birks, ["quite complex and difficult to model,"]{.underline} I think [we
must consider the particular refrain of geopolitics that is capable
of]{.underline}, by scientific as well as more humbly embodied
standards, [destroying worlds along with the world]{.underline}.12 **[To
eschew geopolitics simply because, as a refrain, it is too big, too
grand, or too universal would ignore the conditions of possibility for
nuclear weapons, power politics, and carbon-based globalization, and
would greatly impoverish the explanatory capability of even the best
climate models.]{.underline}** So maybe it is not so strange that
Crutzen and others' attention to the nuclear threat of great powers has
all but disappeared despite the fact that Russia and the United States
still possess thousands of nuclear weapons, and as of late have been all
too vocal about using them. Instead, the Anthropocene, as envisioned by
Crutzen as a universal concern, requires with it a depoliticization of
the causes of that concern.

I am not suggesting that war is the only form of life. There are
surviving forms of life interior and exterior to the Eurocene. No
process of annihilation succeeds without leaving at least a trace.3
However, the normal workings of daily global life are a state of
war. [Rather than think of state of war in the juridical or theoretical
sense, which distinguish war from peace on the grounds of declarations
or measures of order, I want to consider war as an ecology endemic to
the Eurocene.]{.underline} So by state of war I mean state in the sense
that physicists or chemists think about states of matter. Every state of
matter is an order, and despite that order, every state of matter has
some elements of other states. A state of matter exhibits properties
like solidity, liquidity, gaseousness, or the full-on freak-out of
plasma but is not entirely made up of that state. And yet the state
still has an effect despite that heterogeneity. [So to say that we live
in a global state of war, and that the making of the Eurocene was that
making of a global state of war, is to say that war intensifies the
field of relations that make the world what it is right now, not that it
exhausts the possibility of what the world can
become.]{.underline} Instead, the practices and organizations---from
resource extraction, enclosure, carbon liberation, racialization, mass
incarceration, border enforcement, policing and security practices,
primitive accumulation by dispossession, targeted strikes, to allout
combat---are relations of war rather than merely correlates or
opportunities for a war metaphor. **[To put it a bit more bluntly,
politics, colonialism, settlement, capitalism, ecological destruction,
racism, and misogynies are not wars by other means---they are war. War
is not a metaphor; it is an intensive fabric of relations making the
Eurocene]{.underline}**. To make this claim requires
rethinking---somewhat bombastically---the meaning of war. If war has
such a wide application, it would seem to mean nothing. In talks,
roundtables, and casual conversations, colleagues have often suggested
that such an expansive definition of war is polemical or even absurd.
Others have said that spreading war so thin cheapens the sacrifices and
tragedies of those who have experienced "real war." It is curious to me
that [many]{.underline} of the same [people have no difficulty assigning
similar base or structuring characteristics to capitalism, settlement,
or patriarchy. I do not see war as a replacement or a displacement of
those structuring structures. Instead, war is like those other
complicated, heterogeneous, abstract machines but interrelated and
importantly semiautonomous in the making of the world.]{.underline} [The
importance of shifting the point of emphasis or break between war and
other "big processes" is to emphasize the way collectively making death
comes to be its own organizing ecology rather than just an instrumental
means for other ecologies, such as racism or sexism or capitalism, that
are often more obviously invested in ordering---subordinating
orders---than destruction.]{.underline} Furthermore, I do not
think, [given the extreme level of violence and deprivation necessary to
create the global ecology we now inhabit, that it is "a stretch" to call
war the constitutive fabric of planetary
relations.]{.underline} Instead, [war as an intensive difference takes
possession of other categories, at which point phase shifts take place
in categories like racism or economics. ]{.underline}What was the slow,
lethal burn of postslavery policing escalates into the fury of outright
combat in the streets, a race war in the streets of 1921 Tulsa or the
2015 streets of Baltimore. Even in our sacred texts of democratic
theory, the pulsing tributaries of war run throughout descriptions of
political formation. John Locke argued with little dispute that slavery
was the institutionalization of war.4 And W. E. B. Du Bois said of the
process of reconstruction after slavery that war had begun again, and in
fact had never ended.5 Do we think that the same could not be said for
the vast carceral project directed at black people described so well by
Michelle Alexander or Loïc Wacquant?6

I want to take up both premises as they make more explicit what is also
central to Moore. First, I want to consider the question of capitalism
as a failed social system planner, and whether the natural limits of the
ecosystem represent an accelerant for capitalism's contradictions. [The
claim that capitalism is at odds with social planning is simply
unsustainable. After all, geopolitics is a form of global social
planning, and maybe the largest ever, as it is a system of planetary
management]{.underline}. The problem is that we have a progressive
functionalist bias in what constitutes successful social planning. The
global networks of surveillance, multicountry military operations,
mutual security alliances, and transnational border, seaport, and
airport cooperation suggest that [capitalism can innovate and implement
global-scale social systems with high degrees of efficiency and
effectiveness.]{.underline} What is left out by Balakrishnan is
that [one can have vast and unprecedented social and economic planning
without benefiting the majority of the
planet. ]{.underline}Balakrishnan, to his benefit, makes note of the
vast socialization of capital in the form of health care and education
for the benefit of industry. However, more importantly, I would add
to [the cost of educating workers and maintaining the health of workers
the huge price tag of the American-led geopolitical order. The cost of
the wars in Iraq to maintain access to oil runs in the trillions of
dollars alone. Yet even in regard to climate change, clean water,
species loss, and migration crises, it is true that vast capitalist
social planning is in the works: for instance, ecomodernist proposals
for geoengineering that consolidate the hegemony of a few great powers.
They do this via climate control and cooling northern countries while
devastating subtropical and tropical countries by slowing the rain
cycles necessary for agriculture; through capital-intensive
desalinization, which ensures water security for those who can afford
it; and through synthetic meat and food production, which represents
real alternatives to land-based food production but extraordinary
capital input.]{.underline} [All these strategies for "adapting" to the
climate and ecological catastrophe]{.underline}---while currently being
pursued---[are rejected by academics as seemingly unrealistic because
they do not scale for 10 billion people]{.underline}. However, it should
be considered that the visions of an ecomodern vanguard are less
concerned with the speed and feasibility of scale as long as there is
enough for them. In fact, the most common critique by Marxists like
Andreas Malm and neo-Keynesian ecologists like Naomi Klein is that such
design schemes for cooler weather, clean water, and food security will
leave potentially billions without the means to survive. [From the
ecomodernist perspective of elite blocks, that is, contemporary
capitalism, so be it.]{.underline} Unlike Balakrishnan, Klein, and to a
lesser degree Malm, the crisis of "failure" is just the next stage of
what Klein calls elsewhere "disaster capitalism."35 **[The fact that
these solutions do not provide for everyone, or might create periods of
tumultuous transition, are not critiqued within the standards of the
narrow few pursuing them.]{.underline}** Instead, [the limited
applications of industrial adaptation models are a virtuous form of
managed scarcity and opportunity for the reconfiguration of governance.
This transformation]{.underline}, while incipient, [is ]{.underline}for
me [a significant transformation]{.underline} [between labor,
contradiction, and political crisis]{.underline}. **[It envisions a
world, and then engineers a world that can live, and even thrive,
without the majority of people currently alive on the planet. The
limited survival and making of a new fully manageable planet is
precisely a "system-wide economic renewal."]{.underline}**36 The
reconfiguration of the planet such that labor and resources play a
significantly dif­ferent role than previously experienced may not exactly
be capitalism as we have understood it, but neither is it Balakrishnan's
vision of a future created by Marx's understanding of contradictions.
Even the presumption of Foucault's schema of biopolitical capitalism is
that somehow capital cannot live without labor, and therefore
contradictions, that is, immiseration, will create turbulence for
revolt, even if not revolutionary change.37 [In the biopolitical logic
of labor, the threat of extermination is limited by the necessity of a
population or mass to protect and to make live]{.underline}.38 [However,
in the schema developing among the futurists of Silicon Valley, this
presumption is simply false. **Mass death at scales comparable and even
exceeding the bubonic plague are no longer a problem for capital
functioning.** In fact, it is quite the opposite: losing one-half or
more of the global population if sufficiently contained by drones, space
weapons, and other long-range autonomous weapons systems provides a
great benefit to a certain class of an increasingly cosmopolitan elite
who look forward to automated forms of labor that make human
exploitation instrumentally even if not morally
obsolete.]{.underline} The limit of Balakrishnan's and for that matter
Marx's vision is and was the presumption that there are limits to what
humans can bear materially and morally. Like Moore, Balakrishnan is
simultaneously too optimistic and too pessimistic. These [thinkers are
too pessimistic about the creativity of the Eurocene, which historically
has departed from classical capitalist logic and structure in important
ways, while maintaining the consistency necessary to
continue.]{.underline} [Furthermore, they are too optimistic about the
ways that consciousness and political action change under increasingly
sadistic material conditions. A project of homogenization also hides
behind the problematic logic of the contradiction of capital creating
its alternative. **There is something quite dangerous in how this logic
interiorizes resistant ontologies or uprisings against capital as
"new."**]{.underline} Of the many examples given by Moore and hinted at
more obliquely by Balakrishnan, [the insurgent ontologies]{.underline},
whether rural or indigenous, [are exceedingly old.]{.underline} I do not
mean in the sense that indigenous peoples are outside of time but in the
sense that Eduardo Viveiros de Castro has used when he talks about
"extra-moderns,"39 that is, forms of life that have creatively survived,
so far, the onslaught of homogenization under the Eurocene. [To classify
these extramodern forms of life "new" or contingent upon the
"contradictions" of cheap nature is to resign their cause and
constitution to the logic of capitalism itself]{.underline}. And as
such, this logic drags along with it a project of homogenization as a
way of thinking, whereby the resistance or even indifference to the
Eurocene is created by the Eurocene. [Not unlike Marx's insistence on
proletarization as a necessary precondition of revolution, interiorizing
struggles like "Idle No More" or the farmer revolts in India to the
logic of contradiction is to rob them of what autonomy they have carved
out against the dictates of development and modernization in both
capitalist and Marxist iterations. These insurgent ontologies against
extractivism are continuous across centuries of rebellion against the
appropriation of land and resources. They are not a recent phenomenon
created by the end of cheap nature. What is new, potentially, is that
those of us consonant with a modern form of life have begun to
care.]{.underline} Modern concern for extramodern struggles may well be
because of the glaring crisis caused by lives built on and from cheap
nature. However, to conflate that concern with the cause of those who
provoked our concern is politically and ethically dangerous. Like the
logic of the Anthropocene whereby the power to break the world somehow
suggests the power to engineer the world, the interiorization of
indigenous and rural struggles against the Eurocene enables many of the
same assumptions about the grounds and legitimacy of global-scale
governance, even if such forms of governance would be more indebted to
cosmopolitan solidarity rather than elite geopolitical control. In the
former, the difference is more sentimental than material, as the
cosmopolitan solidarity of a new, more just ecological order would
itself also be a project of incorporation and homogenization, except
this time done in the name of the marginalized irrespective of their
input or shared governance. Thus, while it is all well and good to
declare allyship for struggles like Idle No More against the destruction
of the planet, we should be careful that the grounds for agreement are
not a prelude to a new enclosure.

The shift to guns and infantry further increased the need for supplies
and the production of more weapons. The effect, according to Mumford and
Fuller, was an increasing demand on industry to standardize
arms.28 [Mass production and an emphasis on numbers and repetition,
rather than singularity and skill, takes place on the battlefield as
much as or more than the early factories of commercial
industrialization.]{.underline} According to Fuller, "The quality idea,
upon which eighteenth-century fighting power was based, was, in the last
lap of that century, steadily giving way to the quantity idea."29 Again,
here there was a martial logic for which mercantilism and
proto-capitalism and industrialization were means rather than
independent drivers. However, [there was also a positive feedback
between the demand for mass production, the resulting economic and
resource demands on the state, the expansion of overseas conquest, and,
therefore, war]{.underline}. **[Even if there was a martial inception,
once global networks and states locked into place, the difference
between war for economic advantage and gaining economic advantage for
war quickly became indistinguishable. ]{.underline}**Two kinds of war
emerge from the vicious circle of mercantilist states. [European states
fought other European states that were in competition for colonial
exploitation, and they fought colonial wars of occupation and
expropriation to pursue primitive accumulation and, later, settlement.
Critical machines of capitalism played a vital role in the becoming
global of this phenomena.]{.underline} The drive to institutionalize the
mass death set off by first conquest in places like the Americas
required new levels of speed and profit only made possible by finance
and credit. According to Mumford: One abstraction reenforced the
other. [Time was money: money was power: power required the furtherance
of trade and production: production was diverted from the channels of
direct use into those of remote trade, toward the acquisition of larger
profits, with a larger margin for new capital expenditures for wars,
foreign conquest, mines . . . more money and more power. . .
.]{.underline} Money grew in part out of the increasing mobility of late
medieval society. Landed wealth etc. was difficult to transport, whereas
money could be transported by a simple algebraic operation on one side
or another of the ledger.30 Mumford's "ledger" took the form of the Bank
of England in 1694, and was further accelerated by Thomas Savery's steam
pump in 1698. As a result, "war was endemic, because its main object was
to extract wealth from other nations."31 [The machinic and amplifying
relations between ever more portable forms of warfare, primitive
accumulation, finance, credit to enable investments (before the return
on those investments had created new capital), and the demand for
security in newly formed settlements created terraforms and
institutionalized a new kind of planet---that of the
Eurocene.]{.underline}

Warfare: Order and Chaos on the Battlefields of Modernity, 2009)

Although security is primarily analyzed by Foucault as a series of
conducts or discursive practices it is not constructed ex nihilo out of
language. Instead [[security emerges as a problem because of an
encounter with a \"space in which a series of uncertain elements
unfolds]{.underline}]{.mark}\...a circular link between effects and
causes.\"224 He calls this alleatory space the milieu. Here I would like
to read Foucault as a critic that sees [[discourse not as the formative
or generative site of production but as the element of conductivity
through which generation and formation pass]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
Foucault language and nonlinguistic discursive practice are joined by
many different means. Meaning and power circulate amongst rivers,
cities, grain shortages, and disease outbreaks.225 In Foucault\'s
account there is not a strict separation between things and the
inter-subjective economies of discourse that make things into meaning
but there is a difference of emphasis[[. I am wary of discourse analysis
because it is too readily available to an anthropocentrism enamored with
its own facility with words]{.mark}.]{.underline} Foucault reveals that
facility to be facile, too easy. The world is neither fully grasped by
the subject of enunciation, the speaker of discourse, nor does it
exhaust the creative input of things and events exceeding or resisting
human signification.226 When asked by Lacan\'s protege J.A. Miller
whether the task of criticism requires the presupposition of an
unconscious or at least an individual Foucault responds by [saying [that
there are individuals but also subindividuals all contending with each
other in what Foucault calls a \"creative\...and 997 heterogeneous
ensemble.\" Therefore the speaking of language or the resistance of a
particular conduct is not entirely human in the sense of unified or even
coordinated]{.mark}.]{.underline} Foucault is not even willing to cede
the ground to Jacques Lacan of a governing unconscious to organize the
\'ensemble.\'

It is crucial in this context [that discourse should not be reduced
to]{.underline} the semantical field of [spoken interaction and written
text]{.underline}. Paul Edwards makes clear that \"[discourse goes
beyond speech acts to refer to the entire field of signifying or
meaningful practices: these social interactions]{.underline} - material,
institutional, and linguistic - [through which human knowledge is
produced and reproduced. A discourse, then, is a way of
knowledge]{.underline}, a background of assumptions and agreements about
how reality is to be interpreted and expressed, supported by
paradigmatic metaphors, techniques, and technologies and potentially
embodied in social institutions.\"15 In accordance with this broad
understanding of [discourse]{.underline} as a nexus of ideas and
practices which ([re)produce social reality and a certain set of power
relations with it,]{.underline} modernity is to be viewed in Philip
Lawrence\'s terms as \"a structural organisation of state, economy,
society and culture; a power complex and a mode of consciousness.\" 16

of Scenario Planning", 2012,

produced by the dept. of Engineering management at Portland State)

[[Scenarios]{.mark} [are]{.mark} considered a [valuable]{.mark} tool
that helps organizations [to]{.mark} [prepare for possible
eventualities,]{.mark} [and makes them more flexible and more
innovative]{.mark}]{.underline} \[2\]. Scenarios are outline of some
aspects of future and generally scenario refers to an outline of the
plot of a dramatic work, script of a motion picture or a television
program \[3\]. Herman Kahn is considered one of the founders of futures
studies and father of scenario planning, defines scenario in his book as
''a set of hypothetical events set in the future constructed to clarify
a possible chain of causal events as well as their decision points''
\[4\]. [[Scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} are description of a future
situation and the course of events [which [allows one to move forward
from the]{.mark} [actual to the future situation]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[5\]. Scenarios are also defined as alternative futures resulting from
a combination of trends and policies \[6\]. Scenario planning techniques
are frequently used by managers to articulate their mental models about
the future in order tomake better decisions \[7\]. In technology
planning, forecasting, strategic analysis, and foresight studies,
scenarios are used to incorporate and emphasize those aspects of the
world that are important to the forecast. Systematic use of scenarios
for clarifying thinking about the future started after the World War II
and US Department of Defense used it as a method for military planning
in 1950s at RAND Corporation \[3,4,8--13\]. After that scenario
methodology was extensively used for social forecasting, public policy
analysis and decision making in 1960s. [[Scenario building process
exerts a strong influence on human thinking,]{.underline}]{.mark}
decision-making process and initiate a public debate \[14\]. Schoemaker
describes that scenario planning must outline the possible futures,
capture a wide range of options, stimulate thinking about the future and
challenge the prevailing mindset and status quo \[1,15[[\]. Futures
studies help to see the present differentl]{.mark}y]{.underline} and
these are a devise for 'disturbing the present' \[16\]. Therefore, it is
importantthat while developing and analyzing scenarios, it should be
encouraged to consider options beyond the traditional operational and
conceptual comfort zone of the organization \[17--19\]. This
encouragement will help to explore new possibilities and unique
insights. [[Consideration of multiple possible future alternatives helps
to conduct future planning in a holistic manner]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[20,21\] [[and significantly enhance the ability to deal with
uncertainty and the usefulness of overall decision making
process]{.underline}]{.mark} \[9,22\]. Scenario planning helps us to be
prepared for futures and innovate the futures \[2\]. Scenario planning
is a good way to question the future \[23\]. Scenarios provide an
overall picture of the environment and highlight the interactions among
several trends and events in the future \[24\]. Moreover, scenario
planning presents all complex elements together into a coherent,
systematic, comprehensive and plausible manner \[3\]. Scenarios are also
very useful for highlighting implications of possible future system
discontinues, identifying nature and timings of these implications, and
projecting consequences of a particular choice or policy decision
\[17\]. Scenario provides the description of future situation and the
development or portrayal of the path that leads us out of today and into
the future \[25\]. Schwab et al. also state that scenario approach
involves developing future situations (scenarios) and describing the
path from any given present to these future situations \[26\]. Thus
scenario planning process helps to make the desirable future real
\[27\]. Use of scenario planning has increased significantly during the
last decade \[28\]. Research indicates that there is correlation between
adoption of scenario planning techniques and uncertainty,
unpredictability and instability of the overall business environment
\[29\]. Increasing uncertainty has increased the importance of
identifying future trends and expected business landscape. Therefore,
utilization of scenario has increased due to greater complexity and
uncertainty in the business environment. [[Researchers have also
reported a direct link between scenario planning activities and
innovation \[30]{.underline}]{.mark}
