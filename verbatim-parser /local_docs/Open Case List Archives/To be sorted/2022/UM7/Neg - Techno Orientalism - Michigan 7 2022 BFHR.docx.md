## Case

### 1NC Case

#### The role of the judge is to make a [provisional judgment]{.underline} of win/loss in [one]{.underline} debate.

#### The aff's approach to politics fails -- without the ability to [compare proposals]{.underline} they have [no method]{.underline} for designing policy other than a naïve faith that they'll figure it out, and their [refusal]{.underline} to engage the process of [imaginative hypothesis generation]{.underline} proves they either leave things in the hands of useless elites [or]{.underline} they spill up to a new society that's [more likely than not]{.underline} to fail

**Wilkinson, 17**---Vice President for Policy at the Niskanen Center
(Will, October 24, "PUBLIC POLICY AFTER UTOPIA,"
<https://niskanencenter.org/blog/public-policy-utopia/>)

Many political philosophers, and most [adherents of radical political
ideologies, tend to think that an **ideal vision** of the
best]{.underline} social, economic, and political [system serves a
**useful** and **necessary orienting function**]{.underline}. [The idea
is that reformers **need to know what to aim at** if they are to make
**steady incremental progress** toward the maximally good]{.underline}
and just [society. If you don't know where you're headed---if you
**don't know what utopia looks like**---how are you supposed to know
**which steps to take next**? [The idea that a vision of an ideal
society can serve as a]{.mark} **moral** and **strategic [star]{.mark}**
[to steer by]{.mark} is both intuitive and appealing. But it **turns out
to be wrong**. This]{.underline} [sort of political ideal actually
[**can't help us find our way** through the **thicket of real-world
politics**]{.mark} into the clearing of justice]{.underline}. I've
discussed the problems with ideal theory at length, in the context
Gerald Gaus' tremendous book The Tyranny of the Ideal, in a Vox column.
This piece will be easier to understand if you read that first. Jacob
Levy's paper, "There's No Such Thing as Ideal Theory," is an outstanding
complement. And, on the more technical side, the work of UCSD's David
Wiens is state of the art, and adds texture to Gaus' critique. A major
paradigm shift in political theory is underway, and [it's **all over but
the shoutin'** for ideal theory. But **it takes a while for the shoutin'
to peter out**. [New paradigms can take **a generation or more** to
**trickle down**]{.mark} through the intellectual culture. So we've
**barely begun to grasp** what it means to give up on ideal
theory]{.underline}, especially in public policy. It's a bit dramatic to
say that the death of ideal theory changes everything, but it changes a
lot. It definitely changes what it means to be an ideologically
principled think tank. If you agree with Gaus, as I do, then you will
think that there's a pretty major intellectual mistake lurking within
the ideal-theoretic version of libertarianism that the most prominent
institutions of the "freedom movement" were built to promote. Again,
this has nothing to do with libertarianism, per se. Gaus' argument is
general. [It **doesn't matter which normative standard you use** to rank
possible social systems. It could be the orthodox libertarian conception
of freedom as non-coercion]{.underline}, John Rawls' two principles of
justice, [or a **radically egalitarian conception of material
equality**. It doesn't matter. In order to say that **any particular
system is the best** in terms of your chosen normative standard, you've
**got to be able** to **rank rival systems against that
standard**]{.underline}. Doing that ranking in a principled,
non-arbitrary way requires evidence of what the realization of your
favorite possible social world would actually look like. Otherwise you
can't really say that it does better in terms of your chosen standard
than competing systems. Utopia is a guess [The fact that **all our
evidence** about how social systems **actually work** comes from
**formerly** or **presently existing systems** is a **huge problem** for
anyone committed to a **radically revisionary ideal** of the morally
best society. [The **further a** ]{.mark}**possible [system is from a
histori]{.mark}cal system**, and thus from our base of evidence about
how social systems function, [the **more likely we are to be mistaken**
about how it would work if it were realized. And]{.mark} the more likely
we are to be mistaken about how it would actually work, [the **more
likely we are to be mistaken** that it is]{.mark} **more free**, or
**more equal**, or **[more]{.mark} socially [just]{.mark}** than other
systems, possible or actual]{.underline}. Indeed, there's basically no
way to rationally justify the belief that, say, "anarcho-capitalism"
ranks better in terms of libertarian freedom than "Canada 2017," or the
belief that "economic democracy" ranks better in terms of socialist
equality than "Canada 2017." [You may think you can imagine how
anarcho-capitalism or economic democracy would work, but **you can't**.
You're **really just guessing**---extrapolating **way beyond your
evidence**. [You **can't just stipulate** that it works the way you want
it to work]{.mark}. **Rationally speaking**, you **probably shouldn't
even suspect** that your favorite system comes out **better than an
actual system**. **Rationally speaking**, your favorite **probably
shouldn't be your favorite**. **Utopia is a guess**]{.underline}. Again,
this is a general problem. But it does hit especially hard for those who
appreciate the unpredictability of complex systems and the inevitability
of unintended consequences. It's no coincidence that Gaus is a Hayekian.
As my colleague Jeffrey Friedman argues, expert predictions about the
the likely effects of changing a single policy tend to be pretty bad.
I'll use myself as an example. I've followed the academic literature
about the minimum wage for almost twenty years, and I'm an experienced,
professional policy analyst, so I've got a weak claim to expertise in
the subject. What do I have to show for that? Not much, really. I've got
strong intuitions about the likely effects of raising minimum wages in
various contexts. But all I really know is that the **[context matters a
great deal]{.underline}**, that [a lot of **interrelated factors**
affect the dynamics of]{.underline} low-wage [**labor markets**,
and]{.underline} that [I **can't say in advance** which margin will
adjust]{.underline} when the wage floor is raised. Indeed, whether we
should expect increases in the minimum wage to hurt or help low-wage
workers is a question Nobel Prize-winning economists disagree about.
[Labor markets are complicated! Well, the **comprehensive political
economies** of nation-states are **vastly more complicated**. And that
means that our predictions about the outcome of radically changing the
entire system are **unlikely to be better than random**. If your
favorite system is **quite a bit different** from any system that has
existed, then **even if it were true** that it would rank **numero uno**
in terms of your favorite normative standard, you're **not in a position
to rationally believe it**. Clearly then, it's **not actually useful to
aim toward a distant ideal** when you **don't really have a good
reason** to believe that it's **better than actually existing systems**
in terms of liberty or equality or nationalist solidarity or whatever it
is you care about]{.underline}. This is a hard lesson for ideologues to
swallow. I still haven't totally digested it. But a number of things
have become much clearer after giving up on my sinful, ideal-theoretic
ways. Analysis after ideal theory: measurement and comparison [The death
of ideal theory implies a **non-ideological**, **empirical**,
**comparative approach** to political analysis. That **doesn't mean
giving up** on]{.underline}, say, the value of [freedom]{.underline}. I
think I'm more libertarian---more committed to value of liberty---than
I've ever been. [But that **doesn't mean being committed**
to]{.underline} an eschatology of liberty, [a picture of an **ideally
free society**]{.underline}, or a libertarian utopia. [We're **not in a
position** to know what that looks like. The **best we can do** is to go
ahead and try to **rank social systems** in terms of the values we care
about, and then see what we can learn]{.underline}. The Cato Institute's
Human Freedom Index is one such useful measurement attempt. What do we
see? Look: Every highlighted country is some version of the
liberal-democratic capitalist welfare state. Evidently, this general
regime type is good for freedom. Indeed, it is likely the best we have
ever done in terms of freedom. Moreover, Denmark (#5), Finland (#9), and
the Netherlands (#10) are among the world's "biggest" governments, in
terms of government spending as a percentage of GDP. The "economic
freedom" side of the index, which embodies a distinctly libertarian
conception of economic liberty, hurts their ratings pretty
significantly. Still, according to a libertarian Human Freedom Index,
some of the freest places in on Earth have some of the"biggest"
governments. That's unexpected. This is why we need to try to rank
social systems in terms of our prized political values. Our guesses
about which systems lead to which consequences are likely to be pretty
bad. Suppose we were to poll a bunch of American libertarians, and ask
them to tell us which country enjoys more freedom, according the Cato
Institute's metrics. The United States or Sweden? The United States or
Germany? The United States or Canada? The United States or Lithuania?
I'm pretty sure almost all of them would get it wrong in each of these
pairwise comparisons. Why? Because typical libertarians carry an
ideal-theoretic picture of the "the free society" around in their heads,
and (for some reason!) a minimum of taxation and redistribution is among
the most salient aspects of that picture. And that means that Denmark,
say, doesn't seem very free relative to that picture. But there's a
great deal more to freedom than fiscal policy. And we see that, as a
matter of fact, the country with the biggest-spending government in the
world is among the freest countries in the world, and ranks first in
personal freedom. That is our basic data. It doesn't necessarily imply
that the United States ought to do more redistributive social spending.
But when a freedom index, built from libertarian assumptions, shows that
freedom thrives in many places with huge welfare states, it should lead
us to downgrade our estimate of the probability that liberty and
redistribution are antithetical, and upgrade our estimate of the
probability that they are consistent, and possibly complementary. That's
the sort of consideration that mainly drives my current views, not
ideal-theoretical qualms about neo-Lockean libertarian rights theories.
Though libertarianism is of personal interest to me, I want to emphasize
again that [my larger point has **nothing to do with
libertarianism**]{.underline}. The same lesson applies to alt-right
ethno-nationalists dazzled by a fanciful picture of a homogenous,
solidaristic ethno-state. [The **same lesson applies** to
**progressives** and **socialists** in the grip of **utopian pictures of
egalitarian social justice**]{.underline}. Of course, [**nobody knows**
what an ideally equal society would look like]{.underline}. If we stick
to the data we do have, and inspect the top ranks of the Social Progress
Index, which is based on progressive assumptions about basic needs, the
conditions for individual health, well-being, and opportunity, you'll
mostly find the same countries that populate the Freedom Index's
leaderboard. Here: The overlap is striking. And this highlights some of
the pathologies of ideal theory: irrational polarization and the
narcissism of small differences. Some pathologies of ideal theory, both
personal and political Ideal theory can drive political conflict by
concealing overlapping consensus. Pretty much any way you slice it,
Denmark is an actually-existing utopia. But so is Switzerland. So is New
Zealand. The effective difference between the Nordic and Anglo-colonial
models, in terms of "human freedom" and "social progress" is
surpassingly slight. Yet passionate moral commitment to purist ideals of
justice can lead us to see past the fact that the liberal-democratic
capitalist welfare state, in whatever iteration, is awesome, and worth
defending, from the perspective of multiple, rival political values. We
miss the fact that these values fit together more harmoniously than our
theories lead us to imagine. I suspect this has something to do with the
fact that utopia-dwellers around the world seem to be losing faith in
liberal democracy, and the fact that "neoliberalism" can't get no love,
despite the fact that they measurably deliver the goods like crazy. Yet
ideologues interpret this loss of faith as evidence of objective
failure, which they diagnose as a lack of satisfactory progress toward
their version of utopia, and push ever more passionately for an agenda
they have no rational reason to believe would actually leave anyone
better off. [It is **intellectually corrupt** and **corrupting** to
define liberty or equality or you-name-it in terms of an **idealized**,
**counter-factual social system** that **may** or **may not do
especially well** in delivering the goods. [Commitment to a vision of
the perfect society is **more likely than not to lead you
astray**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider how unlikely it is for a typical
libertarian to correctly predict more than a couple of the top-ten
freest countries on the libertarian freedom index. [[The fact
that]{.mark} ideological [radicals are]{.mark} **pretty [unreliable at
ranking]{.mark} existing social [systems]{.mark}** in terms of their
favored values **ought to make us skeptical** of claims that highly
counterfactual systems would rank first. And it [**ought to lead us to
suspect** that ideal]{.mark}-theoretical political [theorizing **leads
us to see the actual world less clearly than we might**, due to
**cherry-picking** and **confirmation bias**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [If
you've **already irrationally ranked a fanciful social system
tops**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in terms your favored value,
[you've]{.mark} **effectively [committed]{.mark}** [to the idea that the
world works in a certain way **without**]{.mark} **sufficient [evidence
that it actually does]{.mark}**. This is **almost always a commitment of
identity** and **group membership rather than a judgment of reason**.
And it leads you to **cast about for evidence** that the world **does
work the way it would need to work** in order to vindicate your ranking.
[You]{.mark} end up **[lend]{.mark}ing a great deal of
[cred]{.mark}ibility [to comforting evidence]{.mark}**[, while
**ignoring** and **dismissing evidence** that the world **doesn't work
that way you'd like it**]{.mark} **to work**. The result is that your
ideal-theoretic commitment ends up **driving your model of the world**.
[But if your]{.mark} ideal [theory is]{.mark} **likely to be [wrong in
the first place]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} using it as a **filter for
evaluating evidence** is going to leave you with a **disastrously
distorted picture** of the way the world actually works. And that means
[you're going to make **systematically terrible predictions** about the
**likely consequences**]{.mark} of this or that policy change. [You may
want to]{.mark} identify reforms most likely to [promote]{.mark} liberty
or equality, or [whatever, but **you'll end up really bad at this**
because your **distorted ideological model** of the world will leave you
**unable to evaluate evidence objectively**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Progress in policy requires idealistic moral passion without
preconceived ideals For me, the death of ideal theory has meant adopting
a non-speculative, non-utopian perspective on freedom-enhancing
institutions. [If **you know that you can't know in advance** what the
freest social system looks will look like, you're unlikely to see
evidence that suggests that policy A]{.underline} (social insurance,
e.g.) [is freedom-enhancing, or that policy B]{.underline} (heroin
legalization, e.g.) [isn't]{.underline}, as threats to your identity as
a freedom lover. [[Uncertainty]{.mark} about the details of the freest
feasible social scheme [**opens you up** to looking at evidence in a
**genuinely curious**, **non-biased way**. And it frees you from the
anxiety that]{.mark} genuine [experts]{.mark}, people with merited
epistemic authority, [will say things you don't want to hear.
This]{.mark} in turn [**frees you from the urge** to wage **quixotic
campaigns** against]{.mark} the authority of legitimate
[experts]{.mark}. **You can start acting like a rational person**! You
can simply **defer to the consensus of experts** on empirical questions,
or **accept that you bear an extraordinary burden of proof** when you
disagree]{.underline}. I think [the reign of ideal theory in political
philosophy turned lots of incredibly smart, principled, morally
motivated people into **unreliable**, **untrustworthy
ideologues**]{.underline}. [This has **left the field of rational policy
analysis** to **utilitarian technocrats**, who have **their own serious
problems**]{.underline}. Long story short, [we ended up with a sort of
**divide** in public policy between **morally passionate advocates
trapped in epistemic bubbles** and **technicians capable of objective
analysis but devoid of guiding vision**]{.underline}. [What [we
need]{.mark} are [folks]{.mark} who are **passionate**]{.underline}
about freedom, or social justice (or what have you) [[who **actively
seek solutions**]{.mark} to **domination** and **injustice**, [but who
**also don't think** they **already know exactly what ideal**]{.mark}
**liberation** or **social [justice look like]{.mark}**[, and are
**therefore motivated** to **identify our real alternatives** and to
**evaluate them objectively**.]{.mark} The space of possibility is
**infinite**, and it takes **energy** and **enthusiasm** to want to
explore it. **Imaginative hypothesis generation is the great intangible
without which progress is impossible** or **maddeningly slow**. The
**technicians**, the **quants**, the **lab rats** tend to be **awful**
at dreaming up hypotheses. **Ideological moral passion** is the
**perfect wild horse to harness**; it could **power the exploration** of
the **near frontier of the feasible**. But thanks to the tyranny of the
ideal, it's a source of intellectual energy **more often wasted hooked
up to a wagon train headed off the map to Shangri-La**.]{.underline}

#### Systemic [solution oriented]{.underline} policy is [key]{.underline} to effective activism to counter anti-Asian violence -- it solves [material harms]{.underline} and helps build [broader]{.underline} multi-racial coalitions that [empower]{.underline} movements, but [detail]{.underline} and [theoretical nuance]{.underline} are key

[For many [Asian Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it can feel as if we
[live surrounded by **absolutism**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[extremes]{.underline}**, with little room for
nuance. But [we often occupy "in-between" spaces and identities, and
[**nuance** is **necessary**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in order [to
understand our work]{.mark} with]{.underline} Asian American and Pacific
Islander (**[AAPI]{.underline}**) [communities]{.underline}. [It's
[also]{.mark} essential when it comes to understanding
**[ourselves]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as immigrants]{.underline}]{.mark}
from colonized nations, and as **[[Indigenous]{.mark}
people]{.underline}**, [[multi-racial]{.mark} people, undocumented
people, [or trans]{.mark}-racial adoptees.]{.underline} It may be
uncomfortable, but [[we must persist in]{.mark} the complex work of
making [**progress** toward]{.mark} racial
**[solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [so that we can create a more just
future for our communities]{.underline}.

In the wake of increased violence targeting Asian Americans, a new
network of 100+ organizations serving AAPI communities was convened.
[[Its goal is to]{.mark} coalesce and [**leverage our power** toward
**policy change**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[solidarity]{.underline}**,
[and shifting the public narrative]{.underline}. The "Asian American
Leaders Table" provides a ray of hope in the type of coalition building
and mutual support that can buoy us during hard times.

Our work broadens our understanding of our own communities, revealing
layers that influence how we uplift and support each other, or step
aside when necessary. For example, we acknowledge that Pacific Islanders
were deliberately combined together with Asian Americans by government
systems that have no knowledge or interest in our distinct histories and
needs. We know Southeast Asians face higher risks when it comes to
criminalization and deportation. We see that East Asians are more likely
to be targeted for street harassment and assault due to racist COVID-19
narratives. We know that our Indian American colleagues are feeling high
levels of stress with families in the homeland who are struggling with a
raging pandemic. Sikh American communities were severely targeted
post-9/11, and were the target of a mass shooting in Indianapolis. And
our Muslim siblings need our solidarity and support amidst the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Our coalition work doesn't shy away from these complicated aspects of
Asian American and Pacific Islander identities. We cleave deeper into
the histories, identities, and stories that make us different from one
another, and back up our intentions with actions.

[[Our vision is to shift the **narrative**]{.mark} [around]{.mark}
heritage and **[solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example[,
portraying Asian Americans **solely** as **victims** does a disservice
to the many examples of Asian American resistance,]{.underline}
**[solidarity]{.underline}**, [organizing, and community development
that has benefited our society]{.underline}. [Our campaign]{.underline},
"Resistance is our Heritage," [tells stories to inspire current
generations of people to change their actions]{.underline}, to [effect
change **within our systems**]{.underline}, [and catalyze a better
future for new generations of]{.underline} Asian American and Pacific
Islander [communities]{.underline}.

In addition to stories of resistance, it's also important to share
stories of solidarity in order to counteract stereotypes that pit Asian
Americans against other marginalized groups and paint Asian Americans as
disengaged in politics and activism. That's why we've launched a new
series of videos with stories and educational guides that we hope will
spark discussions around solidarity in service of transformative change,
including stories like:

How Indo-Caribbean populations have organized around economic justice,
resulting in new budgetary earmarks for exploited workers affected by
COVID-19 in the New York state budget.

Efforts to build a broad multi-racial coalition to end the surveillance
of Muslim, South Asian, and Arab community members by local law
enforcement and federal authorities.

Using the experience of Japanese American internment to end detention
sites and support immigrant and refugee communities targeted by racism,
state violence, injustice, and oppression in the United States.

Resistance as heritage carries us through our day-to-day work as well.
We owe so much to the work of Black activists and civil rights movements
that influences the ethics, values, and strategies that allow us to meet
the diverse needs of all communities of color, and enact necessary
changes that ultimately make for a stronger U.S.

[[This includes]{.mark} work like [**advocating** for **language**
access]{.mark} at the **polls**]{.underline}---[not just Asian
languages]{.underline}, [but Spanish and African languages, too, so that
a greater and more diverse cross-section of our citizenry can engage in
**free**, **fair**, and accessible **elections**.]{.underline}

[We advocate for [justice for those whose
**citizenship**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [legal status, [and livelihood
**hang in the balance**]{.mark} due to outdated]{.underline}
**[immigration laws]{.underline}** [that hurt families in the U.S. and
internationally]{.underline}.

For generations, [[the **model minority myth** painted]{.mark} Asian
[Americans]{.mark} [as a]{.mark} successful [monolith and
stymied]{.mark} policymakers' [understanding of the]{.mark} widening
Asian American **[wealth gap]{.mark}**]{.underline}---neglecting the
fact that Asian Americans are the most economically unequal racial group
in the U.S. Our work channels the voices of millions of Asian Americans
calling for good jobs, union rights, affordable housing, strong public
education, and reliable health care, not just for us but for all of the
groups who depend on these rights. We remember the lessons of the 1982
garment workers' strike in New York's Chinatown and the impact Asian
American coalition building had on workers' rights. [[As]{.underline}
**[COVID]{.underline}**]{.mark}-19 [[cases drop]{.mark}, the number of
vaccinated people grows, and we "return to normal," [**workers** need
to]{.mark} be paid **fair [wages]{.mark}** and get basic
**[safety]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline} **[health
protections]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[Without those]{.mark} at minimum,
[the **economic divide** will]{.mark} only [keep
**growing**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The **benefits** of]{.mark} cross-racial [**solidarity** work are
clear]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The hard part is figuring out
**how**]{.underline} to do it. We are inspired by the stories of our
predecessors because it's helpful to remind ourselves that the idea of
co-liberation is not a new one. The history of Asian American and
Pacific Islander coalitions with other oppressed groups includes the
Filipino and Mexican farmworkers who organized the Delano grape strike,
the civil rights collaboration between Grace Lee Boggs and Malcom X,
Japanese Americans first protesting the anti-Muslim and xenophobic
violence that followed 9/11, and later the inhumane treatment of
migrants and immigrants at the U.S. southern borders. [Solidarity and
co-liberation isn't a rarity for Asian Americans; [it's a **vital part**
of our **activism**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Failure to [connect]{.underline} critique of Asian violence to [legal change]{.underline} is [alchemy]{.underline}, not [activism]{.underline}

[[The]{.underline} **[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[called for]{.mark} the [removal
of]{.mark} Civil Rights Commissioner **[Kirsanow]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[following his defense of internment]{.underline} in 2002.210 He was not
removed, although apparently he did apologize, insisting that his
remarks had been taken out of context.211 In January 2006, while
Congress was in recess, President Bush appointed Kirsanow to the
National Labor Relations Board.212 Congressman Coble expressed his
"regret" that "many Japanese and Arab Americans found my choice of words
offensive," but ignored calls for his resignation as chair of the
subcommittee on terrorism.213

CIA Director "[Leon Panetta announced at his confirmation hearing that
CIA agents that engaged in torture]{.underline}, including
waterboarding, in the early phases of the war against terrorism, would
not be criminally prosecuted."214 In fact, [attorneys in the Obama
administration have continued to rely "on the **state secret doctrine**
and thus seem prepared to confer de facto immunity on the CIA for
constitutional wrongs]{.underline} as gross as those entailed in
extraordinary rendition."215 According to Attorney General Eric Holder,
"It would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to
protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the
Justice Department."216

[It appears unlikely that those who sanctioned the illegal or
unconstitutional programs will be prosecuted]{.underline}. As Jordon
Paust observed in 2007, the administration of George W.
[[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark} had "[[furthered a general policy of
**impunity**]{.mark} by **refusing to prosecute**]{.underline} any
person of any nationality under the War Crimes Act or alternative
legislation, the torture statute, genocide legislation, and legislation
permitting prosecution of certain civilians employed by or accompanying
U.S. military forces abroad."217 Shortly after Jay Bybee issued his
torture memorandum in August 2002, President Bush appointed him to the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and he was confirmed in March 2003.218
[John Yoo, who drafted the torture memos, has returned to his law
professorship at **Boalt**]{.underline} Hall.219 The Obama Justice
Department has rejected recommendations of ethics investigators
concerning violations of professional standards by Bybee and Yoo.220
Although President Obama's January 22 Executive Order "prohibits
reliance on any Department of Justice or other legal advice concerning
interrogation that was issued between September 11, 2001 and January 20,
2009,"221 when questioned about possible prosecutions for torture, he
has only emphasized the importance of looking forward, not backward.222
[As things stand, then, there is no reasonable prospect of legal
remedies for any of the wrongs associated with the so-called War on
Terror]{.underline}.

I believe [[we, as]{.underline} **[lawyers and legal
scholars]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[have responsibilities **distinct**
from]{.mark} those of **documentary [historians]{.mark}** [or **moral
theorists**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [It is a central tenet of the rule
of law that legal [rights without remedies are
meaningless]{.mark}]{.underline}.223 [If the legal system has permitted
or facilitated legal wrongs, [we have an **obligation** to
ensure]{.mark} that]{.underline} **[[effective remedies are
implemented]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words, [[it is necessary
to]{.mark} address the question of **[accountability for
injustice]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and,]{.mark} where there are
consistent patterns replicating injustices, we must [acknowledge
that]{.mark} the [remedies]{.mark} thus far employed [have been
inadequate]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Otherwise,]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[we are engaging not in legal analysis but

[[The dearth of]{.mark} conventional [collective
action]{.mark}]{.underline}---in particular, contentious protests among
the subaltern groups (the poor, peasants, and women) in the developing
countries, together with a disillusionment with dominant socialist
parties, [[pushed]{.mark} many radical [observers to
\"discover]{.mark}\" and highlight [different]{.mark} types of
[activism,]{.mark}]{.underline} however small-scale, local, or even
individualistic. [Such a quest, meanwhile, both contributed to and
benefited from the upsurge of theoretical perspectives]{.underline},
during the 1980s, [[associated with]{.underline}]{.mark}
poststructuralism that made **[[micropolitics]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and **\"everyday resistance\"**]{.mark} a popular idea]{.underline}.
James Scott\'s departure, during the 1980s, from a structuralist
position in studying the behavior of the peasantry in Asia to a more
ethnographic method of focusing on individual reactions of peasants
contributed considerably to this paradigm shift.27 In the meantime,
Foucault\'s \"decentered\" notion of power, together with a revival of
neo-Gramscian politics of culture (hegemony), [served as a key
theoretical backing for micropolitics, and thus the **\"resistance\"
perspective**. The notion of \"resistance\" came to stress that power
and counterpower were not in binary opposition, but in a **decoupled**,
complex, **ambivalent**, and perpetual \"dance of
control]{.underline}.\"28 It based itself on the Foucauldian idea that
\"wherever there is power there is resistance,\" although the latter
consisted largely of small-scale, everyday, tiny activities that the
agents could afford to articulate given their political constraints.
Such a perception of resistance penetrated not only peasant studies, but
a variety of fields, including labor studies, identity politics,
ethnicity, women\'s studies, education, and studies of the urban
subaltern. Thus, multiple researchers discussed how relating stories
about miracles \"gives voice to popular resistance\";29 how
disenfranchised women resisted patriarchy by relating folktales and
songs or by pretending to be possessed or crazy;-\"-1 how reviving
extended family among the urban popular classes represented an \"avenue
of political participation.\"31 The relationships between the Filipino
bar girls and Western men were discussed not simply in terms of total
domination, but in a complex and contingent fashion;32 and the veiling
of the Muslim working woman has been represented not in simple terms of
submission, but in ambivalent terms of protest and co-optation---hence,
an \"accommodating protest.\"33 Indeed, on occasions, both veiling and
unveiling were simultaneously considered as a symbol of resistance.
Undoubtedly, such an attempt to grant agency to the subjects that until
then were depicted as \"passive poor,\" \"submissive women,\"
\"apolitical peasant,\" and \"oppressed worker\" was a positive
development. The resistance paradigm helps to uncover the complexity of
power relations in society in general, and the politics of the subaltern
in particular. It tells us that we may not expect a universalized form
of struggle; that totalizing pictures often distort variations in
people\'s perceptions about change; that local should be recognized as a
significant site of struggle as well as a unit of analysis; that
organized collective action may not be possible everywhere, and thus
alternative forms of struggles must be discovered and acknowledged; that
organized protest as such may not necessarily be privileged in the
situations where suppression rules. The value of a more flexible,
small-scale, and unbureaucratic activism should, therefore, be
acknowledged.31 These are some of the issues that critiques of
poststruc-turalist advocates of \"resistance\" ignore.3\' Yet [a number
of conceptual and political problems also emerge from this
paradigm]{.underline}. [The immediate trouble is how to conceptualize
resistance,]{.underline} and its relation to power, domination, and
submission. James Scott seems to be clear about what he means by the
term: Class resistance includes a«/act(s) by member(s) of a subordinate
class that is or are intended either to mitigate or deny claims (tor
example, rents, taxes, prestige) made on that class by superordinatc
classes (for example, landlords, large farmers, the state) or to advance
its own claims (for example, work, land, charity, respect) vis-a-vis
these superordinate classes.36 (emphasis added) However, [the phrase
\"any act\" blocks **delineating between qualitatively diverse forms of
activities** that]{.underline} Scott lists. [Are we not to distinguish
between large-scale collective action and individual acts, say, of tax
dodging?]{.underline} [[Do reciting poetry in
private]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**[however subversive-sounding]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} engaging in [armed struggle]{.mark} [have identical
value]{.mark}?]{.underline} [Should we not expect unequal affectivity
and implications from such different acts?]{.underline} [Scott was aware
of this, and so agreed with those who had made distinctions between
different types of resistance]{.underline}---for example, \"real
resistance\" refers to \"organized, systematic, preplanned or selfless
practices with revolutionary consequences,\" and \"token resistance\"
points to unorganized incidental acts without any revolutionary
consequences, and which are accommodated in the power structure.37 Yet
he insisted that the \"token resistance\" is no less real than the
\"real resistance.\" Scott\'s followers, however, continued to make
further distinctions. Nathan Brown, in studying peasant politics in
Egypt, for instance, identities three forms of politics: atomistic
(politics of individuals and small groups with obscure content),
communal (a group effort to disrupt the system, by slowing down
production and the like), and revolt (just short of revolution to negate
the system).38 Beyond this, [many resistance [writers]{.mark} tend to
[**confuse an awareness about oppression with acts of resistance against
i**t]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The fact that poor women sing songs
about their plight or ridicule men in their private gatherings indicates
their understanding of gender dynamics. [This does not mean, however,
that they are involved in acts of resistance]{.underline}; neither are
the miracle stories of the poor urbanites who imagine the saints to come
and punish the strong. [Such an understanding of \"resistance\" fails to
capture the extremely complex **interplay of conflict and consent,** and
ideas and action, operating within systems of power.]{.underline}
Indeed, [the link between consciousness and action remains a major
sociological dilemma.\"]{.underline} Scott makes it clear that
resistance is an intentional act. In Weberian tradition, he takes the
meaning of action as a crucial clement. [This intentional-ity, while
significant in itself, obviously leaves out many types of individual and
collective practices whose intended and unintended consequences do not
correspond.]{.underline} In Cairo or Tehran, for example, many poor
families illegally tap into electricity and running water from the
municipality despite their awareness of their behavior\'s illegality.
Yet they do not steal urban services in order to express their defiance
vis-a-vis the authorities. Rather, they do it because they feel the
necessity of those services for a decent life, because they find no
other way to acquire them. But these very mundane acts when continued
lead to significant changes in the urban structure, in social policy,
and in the actors\' own lives. Hence, the significance of the unintended
consequences of agents\' daily activities. In fact, [many authors in the
resistance paradigm have simply **abandoned intent and meaning**,
focusing instead eclectically on both intended and unintended practices
as manifestations of \"resistance]{.underline}.\" There is still a
further question. [Docs resistance mean defending an already achieved
gain]{.underline} (in Scott\'s terms, denying claims made by dominant
groups over the subordinate ones) **[or making fresh
demands]{.underline}** (to \"advance its own claims\"), what 1 like to
call \"encroachment\"? In much of the resistance literature, this
distinction is missing. [Although one might imagine moments of overlap,
the two strategies, however, lead to **different political
consequences**;]{.underline} [this is so in particular when we view them
in relation to the strategies of dominant power.]{.underline} The issue
was so crucial that Lenin devoted his entire What Is to Be Done? to
discussing the implications of these two strategics, albeit in different
terms of \"economism/trade unionism\" vs. \"social democratic/party
politics.\" Whatever one may think about a Leninist/vanguardist
paradigm, it was one that corresponded to a particular theory of the
state and power (a capitalist state to be seized by a mass movement led
by the working-class party); in addition, it was clear where this
strategy wanted to take the working class (to establish a socialist
state). Now, what is the perception of the state in the \"resistance\"
paradigm? What is the strategic aim in this perspective? Where does the
resistance paradigm want Lo lake its agents/subjects, beyond
\"preventing\] the worst and promising\] something better\"?40 [Much of
the literature of resistance is based upon a notion of
power]{.underline} that Foucault has articulated, [that power is
everywhere, that it \"circulates\" and is never \"localized here and
there]{.underline}, never in anybody\'s hands.\"\'11 [Such a formulation
is surely instructive in transcending the myth of the powerlessness of
the ordinary and in recognizing their agency. Yet [this \"decentered\"
notion]{.mark} of power, shared by many poststructuralist \"resistance\"
writers]{.underline}, **[[underestimates state
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [notably its class dimension, [since it
fails to see that]{.mark} although [power circulates]{.mark}, **it does
so [unevenly]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[in some places it is far]{.mark}
weightier, [more]{.mark} **[concentrated]{.mark}, and
\"thicker**]{.underline},\" [so to speak, [than]{.mark} in
[others]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, as a system of power. [It
is, therefore, not accidental that a theory of the state and, therefore,
an analysis of the possibility of co-optation]{.underline}, are absent
in almost all accounts of \"resistance.\" [Consequently, the **cherished
acts of [resistance float]{.mark} around [aimlessly in an]{.mark}
unknown**, **[uncertain]{.mark}**, and [ambivalent]{.mark}
[universe]{.mark} of power relations, [with the end result an
**unsettled,**]{.mark} **tense [accommodation with the existing power
arrangement.]{.mark}** Lack of a clear concept of resistance, moreover,
often leads writers in this genre to overestimate and read too much into
the acts of the agents]{.underline}. The result is that almost any act
of the subjects potentially becomes one of \"resistance.\" Determined to
discover the \"inevitable\" acts of resistance, many poststructuralist
writers often come to \"replace their subject.\"42 While they attempt to
challenge the essentialism of such perspectives as \"passive poor\"
\"submissive Muslim women,\" and \"inactive masses,\" they tend,
however, to fall into the trap of essentialism in reverse---[by reading
too much into ordinary behaviors, interpreting them as necessarily
conscious or contentious acts of defiance. This is so because they
overlook the crucial fact that these practices occur mostly **within the
prevailing systems of power**]{.underline}.

### 1NC Immigration DA

#### Asian Americans should engage legal architectures---it's critical to challenge transnational structures of vioence\-\--spills over to challenge immigration exclusion and deportation of undocumented people---coalitions are valuable

**Gee, 17**---attorney, previously served as an Attorney with the Office
of the Federal Public Defender in Las Vegas and Pittsburgh, the Federal
Defenders of the Middle District of Georgia, and the Office of the
Colorado State Public Defender (Harvey, "Asian Americans and the Law:
Sharing a Progressive Civil Rights Agenda During Uncertain Times," 10
DePaul J. Soc. Just. 1, dml)

The November election of Donald J. [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} as the
45th U.S. President [**[heightened]{.mark} ever-growing
[concerns]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} a **[retrenchment of]{.mark} civil
[rights]{.mark}** for Americans]{.underline}, 2 [limiting voting rights,
invoking tougher criminal penalties]{.underline}, 3 [keeping Guantanamo
Bay prison open and returning to aggressive interrogation
techniques]{.underline}, 4 [mass deportations]{.underline} 5 [and
stricter immigration laws]{.underline}. 6 [[Immigration **holds
particular relevance for Asian Americans**]{.mark} because the majority
of Asian Americans are foreign-born]{.underline},7 [and they along with
Latinos, are among the fastest growing immigrant groups in
America]{.underline}.8 This immigration stream shows that [immigration
has never been a white/brown issue]{.underline} even though mainstream
America tends to think of immigration as an issue only affecting
Latino/a immigrants. 9 On the contrary, [[immigration law and historical
exclusion have **shaped the Asian American legal** and **political
identity**]{.mark} within the existing U.S. racial
hierarchy]{.underline}: whites on top, African Americans on the bottom,
and Asian Americans as somewhere in-between.

The majority of Asian Americans have been identified as immigrants or
children of immigrants.1 0 Asian immigrants from Asian countries face
the longest backlogs for visas.11 [The **perennial connection** between
race and immigration comes up often]{.underline}. historically and as
seen and felt in last year\'s presidential election, [race and
immigration status have enhanced the unpopularity of immigrants who have
become scapegoats for the nation\'s economic troubles]{.underline}.

Critical race theorist Ian Haney Lopez answers that [the [efforts to
seal the borders]{.mark} allowing no one to come into this
country]{.underline} combined with arguments about the issue of illegal
immigration has nothing to do with an immigrant\'s racial background are
disingenuous because they [[share \"**deep similarities** with]{.mark}
racial hysteria that accompanied [the **mass deportation of Mexican
Americans**]{.mark}]{.underline} during Operations Wetback [[in
the]{.mark} 19[50s]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and the **Asiatic Barred
Zone**]{.mark} **that prohibited all Asian immigration** through the
first half of the twentieth century]{.underline}.\" 12

[Many citizens in the waiting, including **[1.3 million Asian American
undocumented immigrants]{.mark}**]{.underline} 13 [[were hoping that
that immigration reformers would happen]{.mark} during Obama\' s
presidency, those hopes were dashed when a deadlocked Court]{.underline}
last term in United States v. Texas [left in place the nationwide
injunction barring implementation of]{.underline} the Deferred Action of
Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents ([DAPA]{.underline})
[and expansion of]{.underline} the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals ([DACA]{.underline}) program, which would have provided
deportation relief for up to four million unauthorized immigrants. 1 4

As this past election cycle, along with continued debates over
affirmative action, immigration, police brutality, and reports of hate
crimes, demonstrate, [this country is far from existing in the
\"post-racial era\" that was proclaimed]{.underline} by some pundits
when Obama, this country\'s first African American President, was
elected into office eight years ago.

[Against this backdrop, [it is **imperative** that social coalitions for
justice **continue to band together**]{.mark} during these uncertain
times]{.underline}. To be sure, [despite the cultural and class
differences and the potential conflicts and impediments that have
arisen, [African American, Latino, and Asian American]{.mark} civil
rights [groups have **joined together to preserve affirmative action**
and **immigration**, to **support**]{.mark}]{.underline} lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender (\"**[[LGBT]{.underline}]{.mark}**\")
[[**issues**; and]{.mark} to **[advocate for c]{.mark}riminal
[j]{.mark}ustice [r]{.mark}eform** [and **against mass
incarceration**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps not widely-known,
[[these]{.mark} issues [are **key components of the Asian American civil
rights agenda**]{.mark}, which has **gradually expanded to accommodate
the most pressing issues** that affect communities of color and
subordinated individuals]{.underline}. As this Article discusses, [[the
past few decades of coalition building]{.underline}]{.mark} between
African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and others
[**[offer]{.mark} reasons for some [optimism about future
possibilities]{.mark}** notwithstanding a Trump Presidency, a
Republican-controlled Congress, and Department of Justice]{.underline}
led by Jeff Sessions [which could translate into immigration policies
and guidelines targeting immigration violations, speeding up
deportations, and limiting federal funding to cities refusing to
cooperate with the Department]{.underline}.1 5

This Article suggests that [[given the **unique place that Asian
Americans are situated**]{.mark} in race relations]{.underline} in the
U.S.-a racial group situated between black and white-[[they can **inform
the struggle for social justice**]{.mark}, which has never been binary.
[This]{.mark}]{.underline} Article [[draws upon]{.underline}]{.mark} the
interdisciplinary areas of social science, critical race theory, and
[**[Asian American legal scholarship]{.mark}** to explore the manner in
which Asian Americans are treated differently]{.underline} form other
racial groups, which as seen in affirmative action, same-sex marriage,
and criminal justice, can inform litigation and community activism
strategy. Professor Eric Yammamoto calls this, \"critical inquiry into
the interplay between law and racial hierarchy.\" 16

[[Far from being a **single monolithic voting block** holding a
**particular perspective**]{.mark} on important social issues. [Asian
Americans are a **diverse community**]{.mark} made up of many
ethnicities, holding divergent opinions]{.underline}. For instance,
[[there are Asian immigrants who are]{.mark} against affirmative action,
same-sex marriage, and do not agree with the Black Lives Matter
movement. These conservative Asian immigrants are **[deeply
insular]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and deny the existence of racism, unless
it affects them. These Asian Americans [[act of **self-interest**, and
**do not work with other Asian groups** or communities of color]{.mark}
in fight for social justice. [But there are also]{.mark} more
assimilated [Asian Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}, who may have familial
ties span a generation or more in the U.S., [**[willing to work
together]{.mark}** with others seeking fairness and social justice for
all]{.underline}, regardless of skin color or sexual orientation.

While divergent views arise on the many social and political issues
amongst Asian Americans, this Article is limited to a discussion of
three topical issues: (1) affirmative action; (2) same-sex marriage; and
(3) police brutality. I have chosen these issues because there have been
recent Supreme Court decisions and recent litigation concerning them.

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} Article [[is **distinguishable from existing
scholarship about Asian Americans**]{.mark} and the law because it
connects]{.underline} three [areas of civil rights litigation that are
rarely discussed together]{.underline}, or at least [in relationship to
Asian American advocacy. [**Far from being an academic discussion**
applying theories]{.mark} to hypothetical parties [in the abstract,
this]{.mark}]{.underline} Article [[anchors itself in **Supreme Court
cases**,]{.mark} **trial court [litigation]{.mark}**[, and **advocacy by
real people at the grass roots level**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The impact is legal violence- deportability is a direct form of violence imposed by the immigration regime with drastic material consequences on the lives of students- focusing on immigration policy avoids rendering the student as the object of study while allowing for improved understanding to form their own relationship to structures of power

**Jeffries 14** (Julian, Department of Reading and Literacy Education,
CSU Fullerton. \"Fear of Deportation in High School: Implications for
Breaking the Cricle of Silence Surrounding MIgration Status\" Journal of
Latinos and Education, 13)

In the case of one particular immigration raid, both immigrants and the
general public got a strong glimpse of the "spectacle of enforcement"
(De Genova, 2004, p. 177) of immigration law: In 2007, a total of 361
workers, mostly mothers, were arrested in a factory in the town of New
Bedford, leaving 113 children without parental care and producing
significant hardship and stress for the people involved (Capps et al.,
2007), their relatives, and the community. The television footage of
children crying for their mothers and the desperation of family members
in newspaper reports resonated in the minds of undocumented migrants,
authorized migrants, and citizens alike and plays a major role in the
creation of a sense of deportability. Thus, [[fear of deportation
is]{.mark} a [powerful]{.mark} presence [in the]{.mark} everyday [lives
of]{.mark} not only adults but also [youth]{.mark} and the school
personnel serving them.]{.underline} In looking at how administrators
treat the issue of migration status in school, [it is important to
account for the effects these deportation policies have on the daily
routine of a school]{.underline}.

The [policies that contribute to the fear of deportation are linked to
the growing national and international sense of deportation as being the
only response to undocumented or unauthorized migration]{.underline}:
"It has come to stand in as the apparently single and presumably natural
or proper retribution on the part of the state powers to this apparent
'problem'" (De Genova & Peutz, 2010, p. 1); furthermore[, it is
normalized as "uneventful, familiar, and legal as individuals come to
understand it as 'the law'"]{.underline} (Menjivar & Abrego, 2012, p.
1414). The [effect of immigration is to make visible what scholars have
called the "spectacle of enforcement."]{.underline} As De Genova (2002)
described in the "Border Spectacle," [the intensification of military
control at the U.S.-Mexico border (Dunn, 1996; Heyman, 1991; Jimenez,
1992) serves not to stop the so-called flow of migrants but to create
the "theatre of an enforcement crisis" to render undocumented migrants
as distinctive national and racialized "illegals]{.underline}" (p. 439).
In a similar fashion, immigration raids in Massachusetts, such as the
one in New Bedford, create a public image of an illegal subject and
contribute to the distinction between legal and illegal, belonging to
this country or not. [This illegalization fulfills the intended goals of
deportation policies not to physically exclude migrants from the nation
state but to include them socially under "imposed conditions of enforced
and protracted vulnerability"]{.underline} (De Genova, 2002, p. 249),
"pushing them outside the boundaries of jurisdiction \[while\]
simultaneously includ\[ing\] them by criminalizing their presence"
(Menjivar & Abrego, 2012, p. 1403). This study highlights how the
conditions of vulnerability and a fear of deportation affect the
educational experiences of these youth in high school by honing into
their relationships with teachers and administrators and the
consequences for educational success.

This study draws from recent scholarship that calls for a [[shift from
studying undocumented migrants as an]{.mark} ethnographic
[object]{.mark}, as a group whose characteristics need to be described
and acted upon.]{.underline} [Undocumented populations do not
constitute, as such, "an objectively or intrinsically self-delimiting
domain for anthropological study"]{.underline} (p. 422), [as the term
only constitutes a vague descriptive mechanism to represent what is
truly a heterogeneous population]{.underline} (De Genova, 2002) [with a
wide variety of national and regional backgrounds who have different
experiences of migration and a variety of contexts of
reception.]{.underline} What they do have in common is that they are,
most important, migrations that have been tacitly attracted by labor
demands (Chavez, 1998; Hondagneu Sotelo, 2001)---or in the case of
Central American countries, expelled by a U.S.- induced civil war
(Menjivar & Abrego, 2012). In this way, [the undocumented students I
observed for 4 years **do not constitute the sole object of study; the
focus is [to make visible how laws]{.mark}** and policies **that
[produce their illegality]{.mark} have an effect on their daily
lives**]{.underline} (Jefferies, 2014). In this study, the aim is to
bring to light the ways in which immigration laws and deportation
measures affect the successful navigation of high school of undocumented
youth by describing their communication with teachers and administrators
in the context of a school.

THE CONSEQUENCES OF DEPORTABILITY IN THE DAILY LIVES OF UNDOCUMENTED
MIGRANTS [[Deportability is]{.mark} the "specific [vulnerability
to]{.mark} arrest and [spatial removal, as well as]{.mark} linked legal
penalties, such as the [loss of rights to future **'legal'
immigration**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Talavera, Núñez-Mchiri, & Heyman,
2010, pp. 166--167). [This term refers not to deportation itself but to
[the constant possibility]{.mark} that one might be apprehended and
deported. It acknowledges that undocumented migrants who have never been
deported experience this phenomenon and that it [has]{.mark} a powerful
presence in their everyday lives]{.underline} (Coutin, 2000; Talavera et
al., 2010) **[and [drastic material consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Some of these are well documented in the literature, such as the
transformation of everyday normal activities (like driving, taking
public transportation, working) into illicit acts (Coutin, 2000; Heyman,
1998); limited physical mobility (Coutin, 2000; Hagan, 1994; Rouse,
1991); and the nullification of kin ties, as some undocumented migrants
cannot petition for the legalization of relatives or leave the country
to visit relatives and may even be separated forcefully from relatives
(Coutin, 2000, p. 32; Heyman, 1991), among others. This fear and sense
of vulnerability affects the way immigrants perceive their current place
in U.S. society and affects the way they interact with educational
institutions]{.underline}. In Jefferies's (2014) description of the
school enrollment practices of undocumented youth and their families in
Massachusetts, fear of deportation played a strong role in delaying
eligible youth from enrolling in K--12, forcing them to choose work over
education, and delaying and sometimes barring them from enrolling in
school.

Menjivar and Abrego (2012) also described [the impact of the recent
immigration regime on the lives of migrants but did so using the
framework of legal violence.]{.underline} Heeding Mary Jackman's
examination of violence, they recognized that [some kinds of violence
escape attention in society, especially when this violence is "motivated
by positive intentions, or is the incidental by-product of other goals,
or is socially accepted or lauded]{.underline}" (Jackman, as cited in
Menjivar & Abrego, 2012, p. 1383). Focusing on Central American
immigrants in Phoenix and Los Angeles, the authors analyzed how **[the
convergence and implementation of immigration and criminal law
constitute forms of what they termed ["legal violence": the]{.mark}
normalized but [cumulatively injurious effects of the law:]{.mark} Legal
violence is at once structural in that it is exerted without
identifiable perpetrators, and it is symbolic in that it is so
thoroughly imposed by the social order that it [becomes normalized as
part of the cognitive repertoire]{.mark} of those
exposed]{.underline}**. Importantly, this type of violence is legal,
sanctioned, and legitimated through formal structures of power that are
publicly accepted and respected. (p. 1413) With this lens, [the authors
unearthed the psychological, material, and economic effects of [these
polices]{.mark} that [create]{.mark} social [suffering]{.mark} in the
implementation of the legal system for not only immigrants with tenuous
immigration status but also their families and community.]{.underline}
For example, **[the authors described [the distress that young migrants
experience in schools]{.mark} when they must interact and share
information with gatekeepers and school officials [whenever they
disclose their status]{.mark}]{.underline}**: "unsure about teachers'
and counselors' stances on immigration, they worry about being publicly
targeted and ridiculed" (p. 1409). [This distress [diminishes]{.mark}
the chances of students seeking the help they need, severely blocking
[their paths to higher education. This]{.mark} kind of [violence]{.mark}
is [a **direct**]{.mark} side **[effect of the immigration
regime]{.mark}** in place but [goes **under the radar** and is
legitimated through]{.mark} formal **[structures of
power]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Dreby (2012) detailed the consequences of deportation policies for
children, families, and communities in New Jersey and Ohio, showing how
families are ripped apart as children are forced into foster care and
how these policies create the conditions for mostly males to be
deported, leaving behind single mothers struggling to provide for their
families. In a clear example of how **[[symbolic violence acts to
normalize social relations imposed by the immigration
regime]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the author reported how children who are
citizens are afraid of the police and begin to associate all immigrants
with illegal status, attempting to "disassociat\[e\] themselves from
their immigrant heritage" (p. 3). In this way, the lens of legal
violence allows one to denaturalize the immigration regime and document
its violent effects in the everyday lives of undocumented youth in
schools.

RESEARCH ON UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH Within the variety of experiences and
backgrounds of migrants, [[undocumented youth occupy a special place
within]{.mark} the [policy]{.mark} of immigration, [with]{.mark} more
guaranteed access to some spaces in society than their adult
counterparts because of the Plyler v. Doe mandate, with more "legal
protections"]{.underline} (Abrego, 2006), and in a situation of what
Gonzales (2011) has called "suspended illegality" or "semi-protected
status" (p. 608). [Gonzales described their last years of [high
school]{.mark} and beyond [as a "transition to illegality"]{.mark}
consisting of three stages---"discovery (ages 16 to 18), learning to be
illegal (ages 18 to 24), and coping (ages 25 to 29)" (p. 603)---and
highlighted the transition, in their last years of secondary schooling,
"from protected to unprotected status, from inclusion to exclusion, and
from de facto legal to illegal"]{.underline} (p. 603). Abrego (2006)
compared the experiences of documented and undocumented children of
working-class Latino immigrants in Los Angeles, finding that
undocumented children "undergo similar social incorporations processes
as their documented peers earlier on" (p. 212) but that the end of legal
protections limits their chances to attend college and decreases their
motivation for education. Another subset of the literature has focused
on the activism and political engagement of these students, often
referred as DREAMers, and their attempt to change legislation on this
matter (Gonzalez, 2008; SIN Collective, 2007).

[Few studies have looked at [how children]{.mark} and parents [make
sense of immigration status in]{.mark} K-- 12 [schools]{.mark}. One such
study is Mangual Figueroa's (2011) ethnography of mixed-status
families]{.underline} in southwestern Pennsylvania, where she [examined
how citizenship status [impacts]{.mark} undocumented parents' and
children's [participation in everyday activities]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Focusing on a homework routine between mothers and sons to help "better
understand [the complex interactions that transpire in homes where
[federal]{.mark} and state [policies mediate local
understandings]{.mark} of kinship"]{.underline} (p. 278) [showed that
educators need to be well versed in how migratory status delimits the
sense of participation allowed to them]{.underline}. These kinds of
studies remind readers of not only how important it is to take a look at
how parents and children are making sense of their undocumented status
but also how [lack of knowledge of [these issues]{.mark} among school
personnel in]{.underline} elementary, middle, and [high schools [can
**severely affect the educational pathways of these
children.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC Critical Legal Advocacy Good

#### Critical legal advocacy by Asian-American communities has [engendered progress]{.underline}---only [public pressure]{.underline} and [legal advocacy]{.underline} can [protect those gains]{.underline} and enable [future challenges]{.underline} to succeed

**Yamamoto, et al, 17**---Fred Korematsu Professor of Law and Social
Justice, William S. Richardson School of Law, University of Hawai'i

Weapon" Revisited: The Trump Era Import of Justice Jackson's Warning in
Korematsu," 24 Asian Am. L.J. 5 (2017), dml)

The Justice Department declined to further appeal the coram nobis
decisions. So [the Supreme Court did not confront an opportunity
to]{.underline} belatedly **[reverse its]{.underline}** World War II
[**rulings**. Nor]{.underline} in other subsequent security and liberty
disputes [has the Court **overruled Korematsu**]{.underline}. 149 While
the case has been sorely discredited by judges150 and scholars,151 as
well as by the coram nobis decisions, [the Court's original ruling
formally still stands]{.underline}---if not for its now widely
recognized wrongful validation of the forced removal and incarceration,
then [for its **embrace of unconditional judicial deference** to
government claims of national security as justification for broad civil
liberties restrictions]{.underline}. 152

Indeed, the late-Chief Justice William Rehnquist153 and influential
Seventh Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner, in important respects,
treat Korematsu as "correctly decided." 154 [[Underscoring Korematsu's
principle of **judicial passivity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Judge Posner
indicates that [during times of hostility when faced with government
national security claims of urgent need, as in Korematsu, [the courts
can say, "\[W\]e're **going to defer**]{.mark}."]{.underline} 155 As
Justice Jackson predicted, ["[**every repetition**" of]{.mark} judicial
[deference]{.mark} to unsubstantiated government claims of exigency
"**[embeds the principle more deeply]{.mark}** in our law and thinking
[and **expands it to new purposes**]{.mark}."]{.underline} 156

Thus [[the **pivotal question**]{.mark} for today and tomorrow [can
be]{.mark}]{.underline} reframed in the following way: If
"it"---something akin to the World War II mass exclusion and
incarceration---happens again, 157 [[would the]{.mark} Court's
[deferential approach]{.mark} in 1944 [be **expanded**]{.mark} to "new
purposes" [in the Trump era]{.mark} to validate transgressions of
essential democratic liberties?]{.underline}

We submit that [the significance of [this question is **tied**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} a key sociolegal insight about [[the **forces
of**]{.mark} **lasting social [injustice drawn from the Japanese
American incarceration experience]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [national
security fears coupled with racism, nativism, or religious animosity and
**backed by the force of law** generate deep and lasting
damage]{.underline}.[158 It is [the "**law's stamp of
approval**]{.mark}]{.underline} on wartime exigencies plus racism \[or
religious intolerance\] [that **[transforms mistakes of the moment into
enduring social injustice]{.mark}**]{.underline}." 159

III\. LAW AND POLITICS---INTO THE FUTURE

In light of policymakers' vociferous after-Paris and post-Trump election
calls for sweeping harsh Muslim restricting security measures--- along
with accelerating harassment of and discrimination against Muslims and
other communities of color in the United States160---Justice Jackson's
warning and Judge Patel's call for vigilance remain hotly relevant.
Justice Scalia envisioned the "same thing" happening again. He further
foresaw a compliant judiciary, as in Korematsu, falling deferentially in
line with the "hand of any authority that can bring forward a
plausible," even if exaggerated or falsely grounded, "claim of an urgent
need." 161

The time is ripe for revisiting and then proactively responding to the
challenges posed by the loaded weapon.

[The political and legal atmosphere after 9/11 (with **some calling for
reasoned temperance** and **judicial checks** and **balances**, citing
the WWII internment as a cautionary tale]{.underline}) 162 [**differs**
from the environment of the original World War II internment (with **few
calling for independent judicial scrutiny** as a check on government
power).]{.underline}163 [Recent litigation now **challenges wide-ranging
government civil liberties violations**, placing security and liberty
tensions **squarely in the public eye**]{.underline}.164 [[**Court
challenges**, **public education**, and **organizational
advocacy**]{.underline}]{.mark}165 **[[collectively
signal]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Justice Sonia Sotomayor describes [as
[a "**modicum of progress**]{.underline}]{.mark}[."]{.underline} 166
[[But]{.mark} politicians' **[regressive prescriptions]{.mark}** in the
Trump era, with its deeply conservative national security leadership,
[forefend]{.mark} **steep political
[backsliding]{.mark}**]{.underline}.167

An accommodation of security measures and civil liberties protections is
essential in a constitutional democracy. But in light of the former's
penchant for overwhelming the latter, we submit, it is [combined
**critical legal advocacy** and **public pressure**]{.underline} that
[erect the **real bulwark** against government civil liberties
excesses]{.underline}.

We suggest that next steps should not focus entirely on political
organizing or primarily on legal action. Rather, [strategic [steps
forward need to **embrace**]{.mark} **an integrated combination of
critical legal advocacy** and **public pressure** at two crucial stages.
The first, [at the **front-end**]{.mark}, is through [**organizing**,
**educating**, and **litigating**]{.mark} to prevent politically driven
abuses of vulnerable communities before they occur]{.underline}. 168
[The second, [at the **back-end**]{.mark}, is through **blocking** or
[**removing** "the **law's stamp of approval**]{.mark}" of those abuses
once they occur]{.underline}.169 [[**Combining critical legal advocacy**
and **political organizing with public pressure is
essential**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in Justice Murphy's words, [for
closing "the door on discriminatory actions against other minority
groups in the passion of tomorrow."]{.underline} 170

A. Front-end Prevention

In today's climate of fear, "[our first task]{.underline} in protecting
both people and key democratic values [is to **be proactive at the
front-end**]{.underline}"---to afford government ample berth for
security actions while preventing palpable government abuses.171 As the
original Loaded Weapon essay prescribed, to facilitate prevention
through vigilance and action:

[We need to **organize** and **speak out** to assure that the expansive
new national security regime does not overwhelm the civil liberties of
vulnerable groups and move the country toward a police state. We need to
**mobilize** and **raise challenges** to prevent]{.underline} . . .
[\[exclusion and\] incarcerations]{.underline}, particularly en
masse.172

More specifically, ["\[t\][hrough **political analysis**, **education**,
and **activism**, our job]{.mark} \[before abuses occur\] [is to
**compel powerful institutions**]{.mark}, particularly [the **courts**,
to **be vigilant**]{.mark}, to 'protect all.']{.underline}" 173

To illustrate, at the front-end, the Korematsu coram nobis legal team
wrote an open letter to President George W. Bush sharply criticizing
Commissioner Kirsanow's prediction of a mass internment of Arab
Americans and his resort to the original Korematsu decision as
precedent. The legal team stressed that by citing the 1944 Korematsu
case and ignoring the coram nobis courts' later findings, Kirsanow
sought to employ Korematsu wrongly as legal and moral justification for
present-day imprisonment of another ethnic group in the United
States.174 Similarly, Fred Korematsu publically responded to
conservative commentator Michelle Malkin.175 In 2004 Malkin argued that
the World War II Japanese American internment had been justified and
that using the mass incarceration after 9/11 to criticize the
government's expansive war on terror jeopardized homeland security.176
Korematsu responded in words worth quoting at length: It is painful to
see reopened for serious debate the question of whether the government
was justified in imprisoning Japanese Americans during World War II. It
was my hope that my case and the cases of other Japanese American
internees would be remembered for the dangers of racial and ethnic
scapegoating. Fears and prejudices directed against minority communities
are too easy to evoke and exaggerate, often to serve the political
agendas of those who promote those fears. I know what it is like to be
at the other end of such scapegoating and how difficult it is to clear
one's name after unjustified suspicious are endorsed as fact by the
government. If someone is a spy or terrorist they should be prosecuted
for their actions. But no one should ever be locked away simply because
they share the same race, ethnicity, or religion as a spy or terrorist.
If that principle was not learned from the internment of Japanese
Americans, then these are very dangerous times for our democracy. 177
Other front-end actions after 9/11 contributed to heightened scrutiny by
domestic and international human rights organizations.178 They also
fueled Congressional investigations into regressive Bush Administration
policies.179

[One potent front-end effort emerged from the U.S. Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence]{.underline} chaired by Senator Dianne
Feinstein. That Committee concluded that the CIA's coercive
interrogations---torture--- following 9/11 did not produce
"intelligence, result\[ed\] in false answers, and had historically
proven to be ineffective." 180 Looking forward, [Feinstein]{.underline}
highlighted the importance of preventive action. She [pressed the
executive branch's security apparatus in the future to **abide by
articulated ethical dictates** because "\[w\]e **cannot again allow
history to be forgotten** and **grievous past mistakes to be
repeated**."]{.underline} 181 To implement the kind of preventive
measures envisioned by the Senate Committee, [Feinstein and other
senators crafted the "**Due Process Guarantee Act**" in
2012]{.underline}. 182 [The proposed legislation, supported by testimony
of Korematsu coram nobis attorney, Lorraine Bannai]{.underline},183
[aimed to **afford due process protections** to citizens and permanent
residents who were apprehended for ostensible security reasons on U.S.
soil]{.underline}.184

[[Community advocates]{.mark}, too, **[figured significantly in]{.mark}
halting** or at least **[impeding proposals]{.mark}** for potentially
abusive actions [before they **mushroomed into widespread
damage**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Immediate national and international
criticism followed Mayor Bowers's 2015 call for a mass Muslim
"sequester." 185 [[**Japanese American organizations immediately
denounced Bowers's resort** to]{.mark} the World War II [internment as
precedent]{.mark}]{.underline}. 186 The Japanese American Citizen
League, for instance, rejected Bowers's "outrageous comments,"
criticizing the "fear-mongering proposals" and the "scapegoating of
innocent people." 187 Mainstream media also weighed in.188 [[These
**sharp responses**, along with **strong criticism** by]{.mark} U.S.
[Representatives]{.mark} Doris [Matsui]{.mark}]{.underline}189
[[and]{.mark} Mike [Honda]{.mark}]{.underline},190 [[coalesced into
**potent** and **timely** ]{.mark}**front-end preventive
[action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the face of mounting criticism,
Bowers apologized to "those offended" and effectively retracted his
call.191

Extending Bowers's earlier citation to the internment to bolster
antiMuslim proposals, presidential transition insider Carl Higbie
provoked outrage when he relied on Korematsu as precedent for a sweeping
Muslim registry and tracking system. California Representative Mark
Takano denounced Higbie's remarks: "People connected to the incoming
Administration are using my family's \[racial incarceration\] experience
as a precedent for what President-elect Trump could do." 192 Takano
added that "\[t\]hese comments confirm many Americans' worst fears about
the Trump Administration, and they reflect an alarming resurgence of
racism and xenophobia in our political discourse." 193 The Council on
American-Islamic Relations characterized Higbie's reliance upon the
internment as precedent as "absolutely deplorable" 194 and warned that
it would "return America to one of the darkest chapters of its history."
195 The director of Anti-Defamation League announced that "if one day
Muslims will be forced to register, that is the day that this proud Jew
will register as a Muslim." 196 When President Trump issued the January
2017 Muslim exclusion and removal orders, public protests erupted.197
Those protests built on earlier organized resistance. Combined with
critical legal advocacy, those efforts temporarily blocked enforcement
of the most prominent executive order.198 The Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals, in denying the government's request to stay the lower court's
nationwide restraining order, cited "irreparable harm" to wide swaths of
Muslims and to the states. 199 It also deemed factually unsubstantiated
(thus far) the government's national security claim of "urgent need."
200 And it rejected the government's contention that national security
restrictions of noncitizens liberties should be "unreviewable" by the
courts.201

[The long-term impacts of this type of front-end advocacy are
**uncertain**. What is certain is that [this]{.mark} advocacy [has
**piqued public awareness**, **spurred watch groups**, and **built a
platform for immediate public criticism of** and **preventive
action**]{.mark} **against newly unfolding repressive policies** and
**practices**. And [it has **placed**]{.mark} **the courts** and their
"cultural performance"]{.underline} 202---[and [the]{.mark} **very [idea
of judicial independence]{.mark}**[---on **center
stage**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

B. Back-end Accountability

[Combined critical legal advocacy**203**]{.underline} [and political
pressure are **essential** to [a second task]{.mark}. That]{.underline}
task [[is for **legal** and **community advocates**,
**policymakers**]{.underline}]{.mark}, businesses and journalists [[to
be "**assertive at the back-end**]{.mark} -- to call out injustice after
it occurs, to spell out the damage it does to real people]{.underline}
\[and communities\] in our midst [and to our constitutional democracy,
and [to demand accountability]{.mark} to principles of equality and due
process]{.underline}." 204 [The aim is to **rectify
injustice**]{.underline}.205 [And [the demand]{.mark} for accountability
[is **expressed through advocacy** and **pressure for heightened
judicial scrutiny**]{.mark} of proffered government justifications for
curtailing essential democratic liberties]{.underline}.206

**[FOOTNOTE 203]{.underline}** [[Critical legal advocacy encompasses,
**critical legal argument**]{.mark} by lawyers and civil and human
rights organizations [aimed at **shaping judges' threshold selections of
the level of**]{.mark} **judicial [scrutiny]{.mark}**, and ultimately
the **judges' response to the specific legal challenges to executive
actions**]{.underline}. . . . \[And [by **supplementing**]{.underline}\]
[traditional legal arguments]{.underline} . . . [critical legal
[advocacy aims to **reveal what is really at stake**]{.mark}, who
benefits and who is harmed]{.underline} . . . [**[who wields]{.mark} the
behind-the-scenes [power]{.mark}**[, **which**]{.mark} **social [values
are supported]{.mark}** and **which are subverted**, [how political
concerns **frame the legal questions**]{.mark}, and how societal
institutions and differing segments of the populace will be affected by
the court's decision]{.underline}.

Yamamoto, supra note 179, at 285, 291--92.

[The task is crucial because uncertainty persists at the back-end. Some
[courts embrace an **exceedingly deferential**]{.mark} **judicial
[posture]{.mark}**, particularly where the president acts with
congressional authorization]{.underline},207 [[**relying upon**, if not
**citing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the 1944
**[[Korematsu]{.underline}]{.mark}** majority. 208 In this fashion, the
Supreme Court in its 1993 Reno decision implicitly recognized Korematsu
as precedent. 209 Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, employed a
highly deferential approach to reject juvenile detainees' due process
claims challenging their indefinite detentions en masse. 210 In dissent,
Justice Stevens pinpointed Scalia's reliance on, but without citation
to, the "one notable exception" to the rule of individualized due
process---Korematsu. 211 The "Court's holding in Korematsu obviously
supports the majority's analysis." 212 [The Supreme Court
exhibited]{.underline} similar [Korematsu-like deference]{.underline} in
its 2010 Holder decision in upholding chilling restrictions on free
speech and association activities of a nonprofit humanitarian
organization on thinly substantiated national security grounds. 213

[Other courts **chafe at the jurisprudential notion** that the judiciary
should **largely defer to the government**]{.underline} whenever the
government claims national security to justify curtailing civil
liberties. [They cite the Korematsu dissents]{.underline} and the coram
nobis rulings [as a **cautionary tale**]{.underline} and reject turning
a blind eye to abuses by the elective branches. 214 [These latter courts
would **undertake independent scrutiny** as an integral
separation-ofpowers component of government accountability]{.underline}
in a constitutional democracy. 215

Justice Sotomayor overall perceives a "modicum of progress." 216 She
sees judges, mindful of the need to accommodate both security and
liberties, embracing heightened judicial solicitude. For instance,
District Judge Robert G. Doumar in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld217 carefully
scrutinized the executive branch's designation of American citizen Hamdi
as an "enemy combatant." 218 While recognizing deference due to the
executive branch in matters of military personnel and tactics,219 Judge
Doumar, a Reagan appointee, announced the court's commitment to
"meaningful judicial review" 220 of the government's proffered evidence
justifying Hamdi's continued detention. Judge Doumar's demand for bona
fide government proof of necessity underscored a well-recognized if
unevenly employed "watchful care" approach to judicial
scrutiny---notably articulated in Ex parte Milligan. 221 U.S. District
Judge Katherine B. Forrest similarly scrutinized the government's
necessity claim in Hedges v. Obama. 222 American citizens, writers,
journalists and civil liberties advocates sued the President,
challenging their potential indefinite incarceration under the National
Defense Authorization Act.223 Plaintiffs feared their free speech and
associations would subject them to prolonged military detention as
vaguely defined supporters of terrorist groups. 224 The government urged
the district court essentially to "stay out of it." 225 It asserted that
the court should defer to the executive and legislative branches'
contention that national security justified the restrictions and, on
that basis, uphold the government's expansive security reach. 226 Judge
Forrest acknowledged the importance of the government's need for
latitude in safeguarding the country.227 She maintained, however, that
this partial deference "does not eliminate the judicial obligation to
rule on properly presented constitutional questions," 228 especially
because "\[c\]ourts must safeguard core constitutional rights." 229
Judge Forrest therefore subjected the restrictions to "exacting
scrutiny" 230 and concluded that the executive and legislative branches
failed to show that the restrictions---particularly indefinite detention
without procedural safeguards---were necessary. 231 In Hassan v. City of
New York,232 American Muslim communities claimed to be targets of
excessive post-9/11 surveillance and harassment by New York City police.
They sued "to affirm the principle that individuals may not \[be subject
to\] pervasive surveillance that cause\[s\] them continuing harm simply
because they profess a certain faith." 233 The district court granted
the City's motion to dismiss.234 On appeal, the Third Circuit concluded
that plaintiffs had pleaded enough factual content to state a claim.235
The City argued that, nevertheless, the program was justified by
national security.236 The court disagreed. It acknowledged that elective
branches possess broad power over most security matters. 237 To justify
impinging upon protected liberties, however, "\[t\]he gravity of the
threat alone cannot be dispositive." 238 The government's necessity
contention needs to "be substantiated by objective evidence." 239 To
legitimize careful scrutiny, Judge Thomas L. Ambro, writing for the
Third Circuit, recounted lessons from the World War II internment and
the McCarthy-era witch hunts about government persecution of innocent
people driven by "unfounded fears." 240 Judge Ambro first highlighted
how those fears led to harsh discrimination against one hundred thousand
innocent Japanese Americans on an unfounded claim of necessity and how a
deferential judiciary passively accepted the government's
misrepresentations: Yet when these citizens pleaded with the courts to
uphold their constitutional rights, we passively accepted the
Government's representations that the use of such classifications was
necessary to the national interest. In doing so, we failed to recognize
that the discriminatory treatment of approximately 120,000 persons of
Japanese ancestry was fueled not by military necessity but unfounded
fears. 241 Judge Ambro then highlighted how that passive judicial stamp
of approval sacrificed fundamental freedoms and led later to national
regret: The World War II relocation-camp cases and the Red scare and
McCarthy-era internal subversion cases are only the most extreme
reminders that when we allow fundamental freedoms to be sacrificed in
the name of real or perceived exigency, we invariably come to regret it.
242 Judge Ambro's summary account of the World War II internment focused
the appellate court's specific inquiry into alleged police harassment
and disruption of Muslim religious and community life in the name of
national security. Turning a blind eye in Korematsu, he observed,
enabled a Supreme Court majority to constitutionally validate the
continuing incarceration of innocent citizens and noncitizens on a badly
flawed factual claim of necessity---something the Third Circuit would
not countenance in the case before it. 243 Echoing Judge Patel's call
for vigilance, Judge Ambro described what "\[w\]e have learned from
experience"---that courts "must be most vigilant in protecting
constitutional rights." 244 On behalf of the Third Circuit, Judge Ambro
therefore cautioned all federal judges to avoid similar future
injustices and to apply "the same rigorous standards \[of judicial
scrutiny\] even where national security is at stake." 245 Unconditional
\[court\] deference to the government's . . . invocation of emergency .
. . has a lamentable place in our history, . . . bending our
constitutional principles merely because an interest in national
security is invoked. . . . We have learned from experience that it is
often where the asserted interest appears most compelling that we must
be most vigilant in protecting constitutional rights.246 In 2017, the
Ninth Circuit similarly embraced judicial vigilance in language that
mirrored Judge Ambro's. The court denied the Trump Administration's
motion to stay the lower court's nationwide temporary order restraining
enforcement of the President's Muslim exclusion and removal order.247 In
doing so, it soundly rejected the Justice Department's broad contention
that "national security" renders an executive order's immigrant
restrictions judicially "unreviewable" even if the order transgresses
constitutional freedoms. Total judicial deference, the court observed,
"runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional
democracy." 248 The judicial role "will sometimes require the resolution
of litigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of the
three branches." 249 The Ninth Circuit therefore chided the Justice
Department for failing to submit evidence of "urgent need" to justify
the executive order's immediate enforcement. As in Korematsu,
"\[r\]ather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive
Order, the Government has taken the position" that the courts simply
must acquiesce. 250 While counseling deference to executive and
legislative national security measures generally, the Ninth Circuit
declared that the "Government's 'authority and expertise in \[national
security\] matters do not automatically trump the Court's own obligation
to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals,'
even in times of war." 251 The judges in these cases evinced---in
Justice Sotomayor's words---a "modicum of progress" toward shaping the
judicial role and affirmatively blocking or removing the law's stamp of
approval on government sponsored injustice. CONCLUSION---LOOKING BACK TO
FORGE AHEAD

[[Despite **incremental progress**, the Supreme Court has **never
formally overruled**]{.underline}]{.mark} its sorely discredited 1944
**[[Korematsu]{.underline}]{.mark}** decision. Most significant[, [it
has **not definitively rejected the**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[case's
contested [principle]{.mark}]{.underline}**---advanced by the Trump
Justice Department---[[that]{.mark} when the government asserts national
security, the [courts should "**stay out of it**]{.mark},"]{.underline}
even when the government transgresses civilians' fundamental liberties.

[Harassment of and [violence against Muslim]{.mark} individuals and
[communities has **intensified**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Republican
presidential candidates called loudly for broad Muslim surveillance,
exclusion, and "sequestration." Then-candidate Trump bolstered his call
for a complete and total shutdown of Muslim entry with a call for
torturing Muslim terror suspects. And after
[[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} election, transition [[insiders]{.mark}
signaled coming repressive religion-targeting measures and
**[cited]{.mark} the Japanese American [internment as
precedent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The President followed with his thinly
vetted January 2017 Muslim exclusion and removal executive orders.

[The questions posed earlier thus **remain intensely relevant** today:
"What will happen when those profiled, detained, harassed or
discriminated against \[or tortured\] **turn to the courts for legal
protection**? How will the courts respond to the need to provide for
society's security and to protect fundamental democratic
values?]{.underline}"

One response is that former Justice Scalia is correct: a serious
violation of peoples' liberties en masse could happen again, and,
following former Chief Justice Rehnquist's and the Trump Justice
Department's lead, conservative judges may well defer to the
government's loosely or even falsely grounded assertion of national
security necessity. Another and contrasting response is that many judges
now will carefully scrutinize the government's national security
justifications for curtailing liberties essential to a functioning
democracy---endeavoring to accommodate both security and liberty. Those
courts, in an exercise of judicial independence, will require a bona
fide government showing of "urgent need" and strike down unsubstantiated
sweeping restrictive measures. Lower court rulings in Hassan, Hedges,
and Washington offer a glimpse. Legal commentators, at this juncture,
tend to end their national security-civil liberties analyses of Supreme
Court cases by noting divergent judicial approaches and expressing worry
yet cautious hope for the future. The Loaded Weapon Revisited steers
further analysis in a different direction---it does so in broad fashion,
leaving explication for longer works. It outlines the realpolitik
dynamics of how: How we as a society are to continue overall progress in
the face of politicians' regressive policy prescriptions and public
fear-mongering; and how, "in times of international hostility and
antagonism," as Judge Patel cautioned, "our institutions, legislative,
executive and judicial, \[are to\] exercise their authority to protect
all citizens from the . . . fears and prejudices . . . so easily
aroused."

Peering into the future, for those committed to both security and
liberty, [this]{.underline} Article [charts]{.underline} realpolitik
[dynamics along dual paths of **critical legal advocacy** (for
**heightened judicial scrutiny**]{.underline} and against mass ethnic or
religious restrictions) [and **public pressure** (to **compel
policymakers'** and **judges' accountability**). The first path, at the
**front-end**, is through **organizing**, **educating**, and
**litigating** to prevent politically popular abuses of vulnerable
communities before they occur. The second, at the **back-end**, is
through **blocking** or **removing** "the law's stamp of approval" upon
those abuses once they occur. For it is the **failure at both the
front** and **back ends**]{.underline}---where national security fears
"coupled with racism or nativism \[are\] backed by the force of
law"---[that **generates deep** and **lasting social
injustice**.]{.underline}

[**[Combined]{.mark} critical legal [advocacy]{.mark}** [and **public
pressure**---through]{.mark} **assertive communities supported by
justice groups**, **lawyer** and **[scholar
advocates]{.mark}**]{.underline}, attuned media, [[and an **informed
public**---**heighten prospects for shutting the "door**]{.mark} to
discriminatory actions against other minority groups in the passions of
tomorrow."]{.underline} More broadly, [**[collective action]{.mark}**
for both prevention up-front and accountability at the back-end
**[empowers communities to break the cycle]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Justice Jackson envisioned [[of "**repetition** that embeds]{.mark} that
principle" of **[judicial passivity]{.mark}** and harsh government
discrimination "more deeply in our law and expands it to new
purposes."]{.underline}

[**[It may be this]{.mark} kind of [collective strategic action that
compels the Supreme Court to]{.mark} formally, and finally, [overrule
Korematsu]{.mark}**---both its **approval of the internment** and its
principle of **unconditional court deference**---while **reclaiming
the**]{.underline} Korematsu coram nobis **[call for judicial
vigilance]{.underline}**.

claims that the camps were necessary for national security by
publicizing studies that [**[documented]{.mark} the [racism]{.mark}**
behind mass exclusion and incarceration. To **gain credibility** outside
the community, it was important that]{.underline} a growing list of
books by [non-Japanese-American researchers could be **cited as
evidence** for the injustice of the incarceration]{.underline}. 128
Accounts by historian Roger Daniels and journalist Allan R. Bosworth
denounced government euphemisms that called mass \",129 removal an
\"evacuation\" and labeled the camps as \"relocation centers. Instead,
these authors argued that the camps should be called \"concentration
camps\" because they had caused widespread suffering. Documenting the
racist views of DeWitt and other architects of the incarceration, [this
[scholarship **helped Japanese Americans
recognize**]{.mark}]{.underline} the camps were not just a wartime
\"mistake,\" but reflected [[a]{.mark} **long [history of anti-Asian
racism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 130 Researchers also began presenting
evidence of suffering within the camps, including the fact that several
prisoners were shot and killed by trigger happy guards, which helped
activists persuade former prisoners that there was no shame in sharing
their personal accounts of trauma they experienced during and after the
war. [[Activists **frequently quoted this scholarship to convince
Americans** who had no familiarity]{.mark} with the Japanese-American
community [that]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}
mass incarceration inflicted on individuals, families and the community
[[was **significant** and **pervasive**]{.underline}]{.mark}.131

[[To **counter claims** that Japanese Americans should \"**move on**\"
and **avoid dwelling on the past**, activists]{.underline}]{.mark}
Edison Uno and Raymond Okamura [**[organized a grassroots
campaign]{.mark}** in 1967 [to **repeal Title II of the**]{.mark} **1950
[Internal Security Act]{.mark}** to prevent other groups from being
incarcerated without due process]{.underline}. 132 This act provided
funding for detention sites, including the former Japanese-Amenican camp
at Tule Lake, to imprison individuals labeled as subversives without
hearings. While the act specifically targeted communist agitators, black
power and antiwar protesters feared that they also might be placed in
\"concentration camps.\" [After the campaign gained
momentum]{.underline} within the ethnic community and increasing media
coverage, more conservative [[JACL lobbyists]{.underline}]{.mark},
Senator Daniel Inouye, and Congressman Spark Matsunaga **[[shepherded
the legislation through Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** in 197 1.133

[[This history of militant community activists **putting pressure on
more conservative leaders** who then **used their political contacts to
achieve legislative changes became a model** ]{.mark}**for redress\'
passage**]{.underline}. In 1970, Edison Uno persuaded the JACL to pass a
resolution calling on the government to \"compensate on an individual
basis a daily per diem requital for each day spent in confinement and/or
legal exclusion.\"l34 Uno passed away in 1976 without seeing any
significant progress. Two years later, however, the JACL elected an
outsider, Clifford Uyeda, as president and he, in turn, recruited John
Tateishi, the son of a famous critic of the wartime JACL, to serve as
JACL\'s redress chair.1 3 5

Under this new leadership, the JACL developed a multifaceted campaign to
build support for redress. To overcome redress opponents and skeptics
within the JACL, Uyeda wrote thirty-five articles for the JACL\'s
newsletter defending the concept of redress and explaining that the
campaign\'s goal was not to \"put a price tag on freedom or justice\"
but \"to acknowledge the mistake by providing proper redress for the
victims of the injustice, and thereby make such injustices less likely
to recur. \"136 To help marshal support for one plan, the redress
committee reviewed various proposals that defined redress eligibility,
form, and scope in different ways. Seattle activists maintained that
redress compensation should be determined by the amount of time spent
behind barbed wire. Critics of this plan argued that it would penalize
Japanese Americans who left camp early to serve in the military, to
attend college, and to find jobs to support their families.13 7 JACL old
guard leaders, offended by the concept of individual compensation,
called for the creation of a community trust fund that could support
educational programs and charity projects. Critics of this plan
questioned who would administer the program and worried that public
relations programs would take priority over housing and health services
for low-income Japanese Americans.138

To achieve consensus, Uyeda and Tateishi incorporated components from
multiple proposals. Their 1978 proposal called for both a community
trust fund and payments of \$25,000 to each individual, or their heirs,
who had experienced removal and incarceration regardless of age,
national origin, or camp experience. Ironically, the \$25,000 figure was
based on a fabricated claim made by a JACL leader during hearings for
the 1948 Evacuation Claims Act that the Federal Reserve had calculated
Japanese Americans lost \$400 million in property during the war. 139
Realizing that Japanese Amencans needed to project an image of unity
before the government, JACL leaders designed a survey that disguised
conflicting views of redress eligibility and compensation. They simply
asked if \"the injustice of internment affected your life\" and if
people favored the concept of redress without wading into more specific
definitions. 140 As a result, the campaign could claim a mandate based
on support by ninety-four percent of the organization for redress and
eighty-three percent for compensation.\' 4

[[JACL activists]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[developed
a]{.underline}]{.mark} media [[campaign to **educate other Japanese
Amenicans** and the]{.mark} **mainstream [public about]{.mark} the
[injustice]{.mark} Japanese Americans experienced**]{.underline} during
the war. They were unintentionally assisted by redress opponents who
made inflammatory comments that attempted to minimize or deny Japanese
American suffering. The most prominent critic, S. I. Hayakawa, a
Canadian-born semanticist and Republican senator from California who
spent the war in Chicago, actually claimed the camps were \"the best
thing that could have happened\" to Japanese Americans because they
\"forced them out of their segregated existence\" and allowed them to
take \"advantage of new opportunities.\" 42 News outlets spread
Hayakawa\'s claims along with redress criticism by others who continued
to blame Japanese Americans for Pearl Harbor, the Bataan Death March,
and more recent trade wars with Japan. Instead of diminishing support
for redress, this [[publicity]{.mark} boosted the campaign by enraging
former prisoners who felt compelled to counter]{.underline} Hayakawa\'s
[depiction of the benefits of mass removal and
incarceration]{.underline} and to debunk the racist conflation of Japan
and Japanese Americans.1 4 3 [Such accounts [**made it difficult to
argue that racism was an irrelevant vestige of history** and **convinced
more Japanese Americans to become activists**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 44

[[The **creation of a federal commission**]{.underline}]{.mark} to
investigate the causes and consequences of the wartime removal and
incarceration [became a **vital component** in the passage of
redress]{.underline}. Japanese-American members of Congress advised JACL
redress leaders that such a commission was necessary to educate the
public about what happened during the war. JACL leaders knew that this
proposal would be controversial and would be criticized as a stalling
tactic or a replacement for meaningful redress. JACL reformers,
especially within the Seattle chapter, denounced this strategy and
argued there was no need for an investigation given the large body of
scholarship that documented the racism behind Executive Order 9066.145

Declaring that redress delayed was redress denied, JACL redress leaders
noted that increasing numbers of former prisoners were passing away each
month. [Political leaders]{.underline}, however, [recognized that having
a government commission provide an official determination of the
injustice was **critical to win congressional support**]{.underline}.
Senator Daniel Inouye and Congressmen Spark Matsunaga, Norman Mineta,
and Robert Matsui cosponsored the legislation that created the
Commission on the Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians in
1980.146 [This Commission [held hearings]{.mark} in twenty cities around
the country [and included testimony]{.mark} from more than 750
witnesses]{.underline}.1 47 As the National Coalition for Redress and
Reparations (\"NCRR\") activist Lillian Nakano explained, \"[[the
**burden of guilt**]{.underline}]{.mark} has finally **[[shifted onto
the government]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where it rightly belongs.\"
\"Bitter tears,\" she proclaimed, \"intermingled with pride and
determination as we reaffirmed our resolve to continue our quest for
justice.\" \"At every city hearing,\" she noted, \"[the united demand
for monetary reparations was **virtually unanimous**, and
**irresistible**]{.underline}.\"4 s

Media [[portrayals]{.mark} of the incredibly moving testimony
[**completely obliterated \"model minority\" images** of Japanese
Americans and **increased public understanding of**]{.mark}]{.underline}
the **[[trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}** experienced by former prisoners
and their children. For example, Time\'s 1981 article, \"Burden of
Shame,\" noted the \"terrible ironies\" of Fourth of July celebrations
held \"behind barbed wire, in the shadow of sentry towers\" and
\"parents wasting away in tar-paper camp shacks\" that \"proudly
displayed starred banners indicating that their sons were American
soldiers.\" 49 [[**While some Japanese Americans worried** that this
**focus**]{.mark} **on loyalty** and **patriotism [obscured a history of
protest]{.mark}** [and **resistance**]{.mark} within the camps, [it
**clearly helped in winning support for redress**]{.mark} outside of the
Japanese American community]{.underline}.150

### Topic Solves---2NC

#### Militarism explains Yellow Peril and anti-Asian violence. 

**Luo, 21**---writer and organizer in movements for decarceration,
economic justice, and Asian-American issues (Nina, "The American Victims
of Washington's Anti-China ~~Hysteria~~,"
<https://newrepublic.com/article/162429/yellow-peril-rhetoric-selling-war-with-china>,
dml)

A month later, a shooting at a massage parlor in Atlanta killed six
Asian women. In response, #StopAsianHate marches spread across the
nation, including in my Chinatown neighborhood. Perhaps after four years
of Trump, marches couched in the reductive language of individual "bias"
are enough for some. But long before Trump took office, xenophobia,
**[anti-Asian racism]{.underline}**, [and **[Yellow Peril]{.mark}--style
propaganda** [served]{.mark} as useful tools [to]{.mark}
**[advance]{.mark}**]{.underline} American domestic and **[foreign
policy goals]{.underline}**. [They may yet **again**]{.underline}.

In recent decades, [the defense industry has **perfected** this rhetoric
to make the case for **war on China**]{.underline}. [Republicans and
Democrats]{.underline}---including both President Biden and even our
most progressive members of Congress---[**amplify** the [warmongering
and]{.mark} push for **increased [defense
spending]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is no violence like the mass rape
and murder of war, yet in this moment of outcry against anti-Asian
violence, [lawmakers]{.underline} in D.C. [are [bringing us to]{.mark}
the brink of **[global conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Asian and
Pacific Islander peoples]{.mark} around the world]{.underline}---who
are, like my grandparents living in China, often loved ones of people
here---[[will **suffer**]{.mark} that violence]{.underline}. And as in
all wars, [[the enemy **abroad** becomes the enemy at
**home**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [making Asian Americans at home once
again the **target** of state and community brutality]{.underline}.

The [brinkmanship began]{.underline} in 2011 [with]{.underline} former
President Barack Obama's "**[pivot to Asia]{.underline}**," which
transferred 60 percent of American air-naval forces to the Asia-Pacific.
Many of these [forces are based on the **Pacific Islands**]{.underline},
including Guam, Okinawa, Palau, and the Chagos Islands, [where the U.S.
military has **deported Indigenous peoples**]{.underline}, **[excavated
sacred lands]{.underline}**, **[committed mass sexual
violence]{.underline}** against women and children, [and **poisoned
drinking water**]{.underline} with chemical and biological weapons. We
rarely question such contemporary colonialism, but Pacific Islander
Indigenous sovereignty is only table stakes in the American "pivot to
Asia."

Indeed, [the same people and organizations calling China a grave threat
**nakedly reveal the real reason** for American
brinkmanship]{.underline}. The Council on Foreign Relations reports in
2015 that "**[preserving U.S. primacy]{.underline}** in the global
system ought to remain the central objective \... in the twenty-first
century." President Biden himself wrote in 2020, "The Biden foreign
policy agenda will place the U.S. back at the head of the table.... The
world does not organize itself."

China is not a threat because it's attacking U.S. soil. [[China is a
threat because it **threatens**]{.mark} **American global
[hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here [[the **underlying logic** of
Yellow Peril becomes **clear**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Proliferating the
false idea that China will take over the West **rationalizes starting
conflict**]{.underline} in the Asia-Pacific; [[this]{.underline}]{.mark}
nearly perfectly **[[parallels]{.underline}]{.mark}** the geopolitical
theater of [a century ago]{.underline}. The Yellow Peril, the faceless
horde, the ever-growing yellow population, an existential threat to the
West, to liberal human rights, to the market economy, to the
"rules-based" order, to American primacy.

In 2021, an elderly woman was knocked to the ground and kicked in the
stomach in midtown Manhattan. Before walking away, the alleged attacker
said, "Fuck you, you don't belong here."

In 1989, two white men ambushed and pistol-whipped Chinese American Jim
Loo, killing him. They blamed Loo for American soldier deaths in the
Vietnam War. "Our brothers went over to Vietnam, and they never came
back."

In 1982, two [white autoworkers]{.underline} beat Vincent Chin to death
with a baseball bat. They **[blamed [Chin]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a
Chinese American, [for the **rising competitiveness** of the Japanese
auto industry]{.underline} and decimation of the Detroit Big Three.
"It's because of you little motherfuckers that we're out of work."

In 1954, courts convicted Eugene Moy, the editor of the leftist China
Daily News, for running advertisements for Chinese banks. He died
shortly after his release from prison. A white mob had just rampaged in
a Chinatown restaurant in San Francisco to "avenge American deaths" in
the Korean War.

[Who we define as our **international** enemy]{.underline}, or perhaps
just competitor, [also becomes our enemy at **home**]{.underline}. These
incidents are not accidents---they are collateral damage---because
[[Yellow Peril]{.mark} and]{.underline} its relatives xenophobia,
sinophobia, [anti-Asian racism]{.underline}, and McCarthyism
[[have]{.mark} always [been]{.mark} **tremendously [useful]{.mark}** [in
building]{.mark} consensus in the American public]{.underline}.

Grazier describes a military-industrial-congressional complex first
warned of by President Eisenhower in 1961. [Defense industry money
drives **[increased military budgets]{.mark}** in three
ways]{.underline}: **[defense contracts]{.underline}**, operating like
pork barrel, that [impact the districts and constituents of members of
congress]{.underline}; **[political contributions]{.underline}** to
congressional campaigns [and]{.underline} at least \$100 million in
annual defense **[lobbying]{.underline}**; [and]{.underline} the
[funding of a **national security elite**]{.underline}, including \$1
billion for think tanks such as the Center for New American Security,
the Atlantic Council, and the Council on Foreign Relations, which
launder industry interests through mainstream media.

"There's a lot of talk about flat budget levels. That's distressing for
[Pentagon people]{.underline} who [want to fund their **pet weapons
projects**]{.underline}," says Grazier, explaining that [defense
spending]{.underline} has typically increased during conflicts but
[can]{.underline} also [grow during peace times if officials "talk up an
**existential military threat**" to justify the budget]{.underline}.
[That new foe is **China**]{.underline}.

In 2020, a bipartisan group of senators and Admiral Davidson established
a new fund for militarism in the Asia-Pacific, the Pacific Deterrence
Initiative, or PDI. In March of this year, Davidson asked for \$27
billion for PDI to pay for new airfields, long-range missiles,
space-based surveillance radars, joint exercises, and more. President
Biden's initial budget, released last month, signals "most, if not all"
of these PDI requests will be funded; identifies China as the top
"threat"; increases defense spending by 1.6 percent; and allocates half
of our nation's discretionary budget toward defense.

Richard Falk, professor emeritus of international law at Princeton
University, notes, "Biden is very much a creature of Cold War
bipartisanship. His comfort zone was established by this western
alliance against the Soviet Union and communism. Therefore I was worried
during the campaign that \[Biden\] was going to try to reconstitute
bipartisanship in foreign policy while pursuing a more partisan agenda
domestically. That's precisely what has happened."

This summer, the Senate will likely pass a broad, bipartisan package to
counter China, including the Strategic Competition Act, which contains a
number of hardline stances, some inserted by Senator Marco Rubio. The
act expands unilateral sanctions on China, requires referring to Taiwan
as a government, and strikes references to "One China" policy. According
to Tang, the act also appropriates \$100 million annually for 2022
through 2026 for the U.S. Agency for Global Media---including government
propaganda programs, such as Voice of America and CIA-backed Radio Free
Asia---to spread information on "the negative impact of activities
related to \[China's\] Belt and Road Initiative."

Tang speculates the Belt and Road Initiative is targeted because it
isolates U.S. trade power and therefore reduces U.S. sanction power. The
appropriation is part of a larger \$1.5 billion Countering Chinese
Influence Fund to combat the "malign influence of the Chinese Communist
Party globally." The act also requires that the Committee of Foreign
Investment review any higher institution donation above \$1 million for
fear of espionage. Senator Mitt Romney recently said he's "very, very
reluctant to bring in students from China \... here to steal
technology."

The [Strategic Competition]{.underline} Act---and the
[rhetoric]{.underline} around it---[**echoes** sinophobia during Cold
War McCarthyism]{.underline}, when the FBI banned Chinese Americans from
transferring money to their relatives in China who depended on them for
survival, tapped phone lines, interrogated an officer of the leftist
Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance until he committed suicide, demanded 40
major Chinese American associations produce full records and photographs
of their membership within 24 hours, and imprisoned and deported Chinese
American intellectuals. [[When the U.S. is in conflict]{.mark} with
another nation]{.underline}, [[that nation's diaspora becomes the
**target**]{.mark} of state suspicion and violence here]{.underline}.

The bipartisan Strategic Competition Act is part of Biden's larger
infrastructure proposal, which he pitched in his first address to
Congress, arguing we'll lose to China without it. Progressives
celebrated his speech, taking the seemingly not-so-bad (anti-China
rhetoric) with the good (massive investments in jobs and
infrastructure).

[There is]{.underline} "in the Democratic party [a **desire**
to]{.underline} \[[use]{.underline}\] [a new cold war with China as a
**tool to organize politics** in the U.S.]{.underline} Traditionally,
much liberalism after World War Two is Cold War liberalism. Keynesian
stimulus is tied to military spending, and you see the Department of
Defense as a tool for economic development," says Chase Madar, legal
scholar, adjunct professor at NYU, and author of The Passion of Chelsea
Manning. "[Good jobs shouldn't have to depend on a **foreign
threat**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} [according to the political
logic of]{.underline} many in [Washington]{.underline}, [that's what you
**need** to do to make it **palatable** and **salable**]{.underline} to
people."

This trade is not only short-sighted, it is immoral. **[Protracted
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[including
**nuclear**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[is a]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[very
[real possibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**," [especially because the U.S.
**rejects**]{.underline} committing to a **[no-first-use]{.underline}**
policy for nuclear weapons. Military and military-adjacent spending is
some of the least efficient stimulus the government can engage in when
compared to investments in education and health care. [As warmongering
**escalates**]{.underline}, [the **powerful
military-industrial-congressional complex** will]{.underline} likely
**[swallow]{.underline}** a larger share of [the]{.underline} federal
discretionary [budget]{.underline} than Democratic consultants had
originally planned. Moreover, [[anti-China rhetoric is **easily
transformed**]{.mark} into]{.underline} anti-socialist
[rhetoric]{.underline}, the growth of [[which would make other]{.mark}
progressive [priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such as universal health
care]{.underline}, **[politically [toxic]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### This is offense---excluding analysis of empire makes Asian identity into a monolith.

**Jung and Nakagawa, 21**---Senior Partners of ChangeLab (Soya and Scot,
"A DIFFERENT ASIAN AMERICAN TIMELINE," <https://aatimeline.com/intro>,
dml)

[[Most]{.mark} Asian American [timelines focus **only** on]{.mark}
events related to [people who arrived in the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [from Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}. However,
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} approach [[paints a **misleading
picture**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It implies]{.mark} that Asian American
[experiences]{.mark} can be understood [in the **absence** of a
**broader context**]{.mark}]{.underline} of race and capitalism, [that
the history of a given population can somehow be placed **outside** the
systems of power that organize society]{.underline}. It also assumes
that Asian Americans share more in common with each other than with
other groups of people, yet [[there is **no single Asian**]{.mark} or
**Asian American past**]{.underline},
**[[politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [or **culture**]{.underline}.
[[Most]{.underline}]{.mark} people from ethnic and national subgroups
considered to be Asian American [[**don't call themselves** Asian
Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Many harbor **prejudiced notions** of
one another]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This stems from histories of
**conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[conquest]{.underline}**, [and
**colonization**]{.underline} within the vast and ill-defined continent
that Europeans labeled Asia many centuries ago. [[The boundaries of
Asian American identity]{.underline}]{.mark}, like the boundaries of
Asia itself, [[are]{.mark} always in **flux**]{.underline},
[[constructed by]{.mark} **dynamics of**]{.underline} power that demand
to be studied: **[[imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, racial
domination, gender oppression, labor exploitation, war, and social
movements.

We cannot fully understand Asian American history without asking why
Asians arrived in the Americas, and what relationship their arrival had
to the global conditions affecting people across racial and national
boundaries at the time. For example, why did the British "coolie" trade
accelerate after Britain outlawed slavery in 1833? A more traditional
Asian American timeline might not make this correlation visible, yet
enslaved African people and indentured "coolies" were closely related
within British and U.S. systems of racialized labor control in the 19th
Century. Viewing Asian migration to the Americas in this context starts
to erode the myth of the United States as a benevolent land of
immigrants, to reveal instead a nation effectively ruled by oligarchy in
which the plights of various kinds of exploited workers and oppressed
groups have been inextricably connected.

Many of us learn to think of race as natural categories of human
difference based on skin color, culture, or national origin.
[This]{.underline} timeline [invites us to think of race
differently]{.underline}, [as an **instrument of empire**]{.underline}.
As Asian American scholar James Kyung-Jin Lee has stated, "Race is
better described as a verb than a noun, as production rather than
destiny." Race is the verb that animates a centuries-old world economic
process, constructing human difference among the many to build power for
the few.

No timeline could fully account for six centuries of history, and this
one is no exception. Instead it is meant to serve as a resource for
critical thinking, a tool for in-depth and nuanced discussions to see
Asian Americans and others both as subjects of domination and as agents
of history. It is organized by historical time periods marked by major
shifts like the U.S. Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War II,
and Reagan-Era neoliberalism. Events are organized by the reasoning, or
logics, that have shaped the United States economically, politically,
and culturally -- the interrelated struggles over land (settler
colonialism), labor (slavery), and geopolitical power (empire). It also
features sample stories of freedom, a contested idea that has fueled
efforts both to lift greater numbers of people out of oppression, and to
amass benefits for some people at the expense of others.

This tool invites us to see both the specificity of group-differentiated
oppressions and their relationships to one another within racial
capitalism. [The importance of studying Asian American history in this
way lies in the urgent need to work toward democracy amid]{.underline}
rising forms of [**authoritarianism** and **nationalism**]{.underline}.
[These dangers are the **products of American empire**]{.underline},
[which has accumulated power and wealth for the few by producing and
leveraging divisions among the many]{.underline}. True democracy will
depend on our ability to imagine new ways of being that reject racial
subjugation and supremacy in favor of "a new society based more on human
values," as the great Grace Lee Boggs put it so well.

dml)

Yet such hawkish rhetoric against China---which was initially spread by
Donald Trump and other Republicans around the coronavirus---has directly
contributed to [rising [anti-Asian violence]{.mark}]{.underline} across
the country. In fact, [[it's **reflective** of]{.mark} a **long
history** of [US foreign policy]{.mark} in Asia centered on
**domination** and **violence**]{.underline}, fueled by racism.
[Belittling and [dehumanizing Asians has helped **justify**]{.mark}
**endless wars** and the **expansion of US militarism**]{.underline}.
And this has deadly consequences for Asians and Asian Americans,
especially women.

[Anti-Asian violence through US foreign policy has manifested in the
wars that have **killed millions**]{.underline}, **[torn families
apart]{.underline}**, [and led to **massive displacement**]{.underline};
in the [**nuclear tests** and **chemical weapons storage** that resulted
in **environmental contamination**]{.underline} in Okinawa, Guam, and
the Marshall Islands; in the widespread use of [**napalm** and **Agent
Orange**]{.underline} in Vietnam, Laos, and Korea; in the US [**military
bases** that have destroyed villages and entire
communities]{.underline}; in the [**violence** perpetrated by US
soldiers on Asian women's bodies]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} in the
imposition of [**sanctions** that result in economic]{.underline},
[social]{.underline}, [and physical harms to everyday
people]{.underline}.

[These things **can't happen** without dehumanization]{.underline}, and
this dynamic has had dire consequences for Asian Americans, especially
women. Of the 3,800 hate incidents reported against Asian Americans last
year, almost 70 percent were directed at women. Exoticized and
fetishized [Asian American women have borne a **dual
burden**]{.underline} of both racism and sexism, viewed on one hand as
submissive and sexually available "lotus blossoms" and on the other as
manipulative and dangerous "dragon ladies."

[[Asian women are **particularly harmed** by]{.mark} **US militarism**
and **foreign policy**]{.underline}---economically, socially, and
physically. [In Korea]{.underline}, [women have **long been collateral
damage** from **[militarized US foreign policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The 1950--53 Korean War, which killed 4 million people, led to social
and political chaos, separated families, and orphaned and widowed
millions, creating conditions where women were without homes and work.
This forced women into prostitution, according to Katherine H.S. Moon,
an expert on US military prostitution in South Korea and author of the
book Sex Among Allies.

Over a million Korean women have worked in "camptowns" that surround US
military bases in South Korea. This system of [**military prostitution**
was]{.underline} controlled by the South Korean government and
[**supported** by the US military in order to **strengthen military
alliances**]{.underline} and prop up the South Korean economy. Yet the
women were stigmatized, "destined to invisibility and silence,"
according to Moon.

These camptowns not only facilitated the immigration of thousands of
Korean "war brides" to the United States, but also transported the
system itself. As the US military steadily reduced its troop presence in
Asia, camptown establishments, facing social upheaval and economic
uncertainty, began sending their madams and sex workers to US domestic
military sites through brokered marriages with US servicemen. Many of
these exploited Korean women arrived in the US South, a region housing
many domestic military bases, which saw the proliferation of military
prostitution. By the 1980s, the Korean American sex trade would spread
from these Southern military towns to elsewhere in the United
States---including the Atlanta metropolitan area, site of Tuesday's
horrific mass shooting.

[[We see]{.mark} this [anti-Asian violence]{.mark} now [manifesting in
**ramped up US aggression**]{.mark} toward China and the **ubiquitous US
military presence** throughout the Asia-Pacific region]{.underline}.
According to American University professor David Vine, there are
approximately 300 US bases in the Asia-Pacific region circling China,
which along with "aggressive naval and air patrols and military
exercises, increases threats to Chinese security and encourages the
Chinese government to respond by boosting its own military spending and
activity." The [military buildup is **raising regional military
tensions**]{.underline}, [and [**increasing the risk**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a deadly military clash or what should be an

It is at this impasse and with such questions that the essays collected
here begin: with the notion derived from Fanon, of the impossibility of
representing race, either for the slave or the master, outside of an
entrenched visual schema predicated on the fungibility of the black
slave that this reckoning comes to the fore at this moment and that it
connects cultural practitioners working across a range of disciplines
--art, history, literature, film, critical theory --not only suggests
the longevity of [[Fanon's insight]{.mark},]{.underline} but also
[[underlines]{.underline}]{.mark} the pressing need to
[t]{.underline}hink [[the structural and structuring function of racial
difference for our symbolic economies]{.underline}]{.mark}. For it is
that very function which contemporary [[racial theory more often than
not seeks to leap over,]{.mark} in the process revealing its own
ineffectuality, a kind of willful blindness that cannot be
overstated.]{.underline} In its single-minded capacity to concentrate on
everything except [[that which matters most in the restructuring of
white supremacy]{.mark},]{.underline} such theory is undoubtedly more
egregious than intellectual faux pas or public disservice. It is a
modality of complicity, or better, fraud. But the fraudulence of this
diverse intellectual project is not only analytic; it is also ethical.
Besieged by the conservative restoration, the Left finds itself today
enamored of political pragmatism and in thrall  to the lures of
counter-hegemonic populism. From the emergent networks of
anti-globalization to the reinvigorated peace movement, from the
embattled environmentalist campaigns to the desperate efforts at urban
police reform, the official rhetoric is multiracial and the
organizational logic is coalition. Yet, for whatever energies are
dispensed in elaborating the new complexity of race in the age of
globality, the radical imagination inexorably comes to rest on the
assumption of horizontality, that is ot say, a progressive
community-in-struggle, even if only a possible one. Indeed, it has
become commonplace in the U.S. to call for a paradigm shift with respect
to racial theory and the politics of anti-racism. This clarion call
resonates in the ivory towers of academe, in the pages of the most
useless print media outlets, certainly in the alternative press, and in
the policy papers and strategic deliberations of progressive non-profit
institutes and community-based organizations. What [[we are told, in a
variety of tones and tenors, is that race matters are no longer]{.mark}
--if they ever were -- ["simply black and white"]{.mark} at the least,
the focus of such a Manichean lens [is deemed inadequate]{.mark} to
apprehend the current and historical relatity of]{.underline} U.S.
[racial formation (]{.underline}to say nothing of the Americas more
generally or other regions of the world) [At its worst[, this
dichotomous view is rendered as]{.mark}]{.underline} politically
stunting and, moreover, as effectively [[excluding "discussion of the
colors in the middle, now inexorable parts of the Black/White
spectrum]{.underline}]{.mark}." We now enjoy a vast literature in the
social sciences and humanities detailing the vexed position (or
positions), between the black and the white. "Neither black nor white"
thus indicates not only the articulation of multiracial (or Mixed race)
identity claims in the post-civil rights era, but also the contemporary
reformulations of critique and political mobilization among Asian
Americans, Pacific Islanders, Chicana/os, Latina/os, and Native American
peoples. Of course, racial discourse in what would become the U.S., from
the colonial era onward, has always been multi-polar, so to speak, and
the psychodynamics of race have always been quite complex; the lines of
force and the relations of racial power have been reconfigured regularly
across a multiplicity of times and spaces. In fact, the notion of a
black/white paradigm is something of a theoretical fiction, deployed for
a wide range of purposes. In our attempts to displace it, then, we do
well to recognize it as a recent emergence, involved in an imaginary
lure that says more about the historical preoccupations of white
supremacy than it does about, say, the blind insistence of black
scholars, activists, or communities. When perusing the critical
literature on the "explanatory difficulty" of present-day racial
politics, one frequently wonders exactly to whom the demand to go
"beyond black and white" is being addressed. Also puzzling is the
singularly incoherent nature of the reasoning demonstrated in current
race talk, a failure, that is, to offer cogent accounts of the
implications of this newfound (or, more precisely, rediscovered)
complexity. Taken together, these twin ambiguities beg a key question:
what economies of enunciation are involved in this broadly atterned
discursive gesture to put an end to "biracial theorizing"? Legal scholar
Mari Matsuda offers a provocative thought on this score. During a
symposium on critical race theory at the Yale Law School in 1997 she
claimed[: \[[When we\] say we need to move beyond Black and
white]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} this is what a [[whole lot of
people say]{.mark}]{.underline} or feel or think: ["[thank goodness we
can get off that paradigm, because those black people made me feel so
uncomfortable. I know all about Blacks, but I really don't know anything
about Asians,]{.mark}]{.underline} a[[nd while we're deconstructing that
Black-white paradigm, we also need to reconsider the category of race
altogether]{.underline}]{.mark}, since race, as you know, is a
constructed category, and thank god I don't have to take those angry
black people seriously anymore."  Importantly, the [[comment is drawn
from an otherwise sympathetic mediation on a particular danger attendant
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the desire for new analyses, and [[the often
anxious drive for multiracial coalition, namely, the **persistent risk
of forgetting the centrality of anti-blackness** to global white
supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fanon, again, is prescient: "[[Wherever
he goes, the negro remains a Negro]{.underline}]{.mark}" (B, 173).
Wherever; there is no outside. Too often we forget, here in the U.S.
especially, that there are blacks everywhere. When so many speak of the
peculiarity of race as a North American obsession (one hears of the odd
rigidity of the Anglo-Saxon racial formation), it is important to think
about black people as situated in those myriad locales supposedly
outside of or alternate to the black-white binary. Lewis Gordon,
philosopher and leading contemporary commentator on Fanon, writes:
**[[Although there are people who function as "the blacks" of particular
contexts, there is a group of people who function as the blacks
everywhere.]{.underline}]{.mark}** They are called, in now-archaic
language --Negroes. Negroes are the blacks of everywhere, the black of
blacks, the blackest blacks. [**[Blackness functions as the prime racial
signifier. It is the element that enters a room and frightens Reason
out... The historical specificity of blackness as a point from which the
greatest distance must be forged]{.mark}**]{.underline} entails its
status as metaphor.

#### They parallel black suffering to Asian suffering -- every attempt to position the black by the way of analogy is parasitic upon blackness

**Wilderson 10** \[Frank B. Wilderson, Associate Professor of African
American Studies and Drama at the University of California & former
member of the Umkhonto we Sizwe, Red, White and Black: Cinema and the
Structure of US Antagonisms\]

This is one of several moments in *Black Skin, White Masks* when Fanon
splits the hair between social oppression and structural suffering,
making it possible to theorize the impossibility of a Black ontology
(thus allowing us to meditate on how the Black suffers) without being
chained to the philosophical and rhetorical demands of analogy, demands
which the evidentiary register of social oppression (i.e., how many Jews
died in the ovens, how many Blacks were lost in the Middle Passage)
normally imposes upon such meditations. [The ruse of analogy erroneously
locates the Black in the world---a place where s/he has not been since
the dawning of Blackness. This attempt to position the Black in the
world]{.underline} by way of analogy [is not only a mystification, and
often erasure, of Blackness's grammar of suffering (accumulation and
fungibility or the status of being non-Human) but simultaneously also a
provision for civil society, promising an enabling modality for Human
ethical dilemmas.]{.underline} It is a mystification and an erasure
because, whereas [Masters]{.underline} may share the same fantasies as
Slaves, [and Slaves]{.underline} can speak as though they have the same
interests as Masters, their [respective grammars of suffering are
irreconcilable]{.underline}**.** In dragging his interlocutors kicking
and screaming through "Fact of Blackness," or what Ronald Judy has
translated more pointedly as "The Lived Experience of the Black," [Fanon
is not attempting to play "oppression Olympics"]{.underline} and thus
draw conclusions that Blacks are at the top of every empirical hierarchy
of social discrimination, though that case has also been made.xv Having
established that, yes, the Jew is oppressed (and, yes, the Black is
oppressed) Fanon refuses to let the *lived experience* of oppression
dictate the terms of his meditations on suffering. He writes: \[The
Jew\] belongs to the race of those \[who\] since the beginning of time
have never known cannibalism. What an idea, to eat one's father! Simple
enough *one has only not to be a nigger* \[emphasis mine\]...\[I\]n my
case everything takes on a new guise. I am the *slave* not of an *idea*
others have of me but of my own appearance. (*Black Skin, White Masks*
115-16) Two tensions are at work here. One operates under the labor of
ethical dilemmas\-- "simple enough one has only not to be a nigger."xvi
This, I submit, is the essence of *being* for the White and non-Black
position: ontology scaled down to a global common denominator. The other
tension is found in the impossibility of ethical dilemmas for the Black:
"I am," Fanon writes, "a *slave* not of an *idea* others have of me but
of my own appearance." Being can thus be thought of, in the first
ontological instance, as nonniggerness; and slavery then as niggerness.
The visual field, "my own appearance," is the cut, the mechanism that
elaborates the [division between the non-niggerness and slavery, the
difference between the living and the dead. Whereas Humans exist on some
plane of being and thus can become existentially present through some
struggle for/of/through recognition, Blacks cannot attain the plane of
recognition]{.underline} (West 82). Spillers, Fanon, and Hartman
maintain that [the violence that has positioned and repetitively
re-positions the Black as a void of historical movement is without
analog in the suffering dynamics of the ontologically
alive.]{.underline} The violence that turns the African into a thing is
without analog because it does not simply oppress the Black through
tactile and empirical technologies of oppression, like the "little
family quarrels" which for Fanon exemplify the Jewish Holocaust. Rather,
[the gratuitous violence of the Black's first ontological instance, the
Middle Passage, "wiped out \[his/her\] metaphysics...]{.underline}his
\[her\] customs and sources on which they are based" (*BSWM* 110). Jews
went into Auschwitz and came out as Jews. Africans went into the ships
and came out as Blacks. The former is a Human holocaust; the latter is a
Human *and* a metaphysical holocaust. That is why it makes little sense
to attempt analogy: the Jews have the Dead (the *Muselmenn*) among them;
the Dead have the Blacks among them. [This violence which turns a body
into flesh, ripped apart literally and imaginatively, destroys the
possibility of ontology because it positions the Black within an
infinite and indeterminately horrifying and open vulnerability, an
object made available]{.underline} (which is to say fungible[) for any
subject. As such, "the black has no ontological resistance in the eyes
of the white man" (110) or, more precisely, in the eyes of
Humanity.]{.underline}

#### There is an impact to all of these links -- obscuring the structural position of blackness causes their coalitional politics to fail -- this explicitly indicts their method which is BASED upon intersectionality/coalitions -- only the alt solves

**Sexton '10** \[Jared Sexton, Associate professor of African American
studies and film and media studies at the University of California,
Irvine, 2010, "People-of-Color-Blindness; Notes on the Afterlife of
Slavery,"

[[If the oppression of]{.mark} non[black people of color]{.mark} in,
and]{.underline} perhaps [beyond, the United States [seems
conditional]{.mark} to the historic instance and functions at a more
restricted empirical scope, **[antiblackness seems invariant]{.mark} and
limitless** (which does not mean that the former is somehow negligible
and short-lived or that the latter is exhaustive and
unchanging]{.underline}). If pursued with some consistency, the sort of
[comparative analysis]{.underline} outlined above would likely impact
the formulation of political strategy and modify the demeanor of our
political culture. In fact, it [might denature the comparative instinct
altogether in favor of a relational analysis more adequate to the
task]{.underline}. Yet all of [[this is obviated by **the silencing
mechanism**]{.mark} par excellence **[in Left political]{.mark} and
intellectual [circles]{.mark}** today: "[Don't play Oppression
Olympics]{.mark}!"]{.underline} [The Oppression Olympics dogma levels a
charge amounting to little more than **[a leftist version of "playing
the race card]{.mark}."**]{.underline} To fuss with details of compara-
tive (or relational) analysis is to play into the hands of
divide-and-conquer tactics and to promote a callous immorality.72
However, as in its conserva- tive complement, [one notes in this
catchphrase the unwarranted transla- tion of an inquiring position of
comparison into an insidious posture of competition, [the **translation
of ethical critique into unethical
attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [This point allows us to
understand better the intimate relationship between [the censure of
black inquiry and]{.mark} the recurrent [analogizing to black
suffering]{.mark} mentioned above: they [bear **a common refusal** to
admit to]{.mark} **significant dif[- ferences of structural
position]{.mark}** [born of discrepant histories]{.mark} between blacks
and their political allies, actual or potential]{.underline}. [We
might]{.underline}, finally, [[name this]{.mark} refusal
**[people-of-color-blindness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a form of
[colorblindness]{.underline} inherent to the concept of "people of
color" [to the precise extent that it misunderstands the specificity of
antiblackness and presumes or insists upon the mono- lithic character of
victimization under white supremacy]{.underline}73 --- thinking (the
afterlife of) slavery as a form of exploitation or colonization or a
species of racial oppression among others.74

The upshot of this predicament is that [obscuring the structural
position of the category of blackness will inevitably undermine
multiracial coalition building as a politics of radical opposition and,
to that extent[,]{.mark} **[force]{.mark} the question of [black
liberation]{.mark}** [back to **the center of
discussion**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[Every
analysis]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that attempts to understand the
complexities of racial rule and the machinations of the racial state
**[without accounting for black existence]{.mark}** within its
framework]{.underline}---which does not mean simply listing it among a
chain of equivalents or returning to it as an afterthought---[[**is
doomed** to miss]{.mark} [what is essential]{.mark} about the
situation]{.underline}. [Black existence does not represent the total
reality of the racial formation --- it is not the beginning and the end
of the story---but it does relate to the totality; it indicates **the
(repressed) truth** of the political and economic system]{.underline}.
That is to say, the whole range of positions within the racial formation
is most fully understood from this vantage point, not unlike the way in
which the range of gender and sexual variance under patriarchal and
heteronormative regimes is most fully understood through lenses that are
feminist and queer.75 What is lost for the study of black existence in
the proposal for a decentered, "postblack" paradigm is a proper analysis
of the true scale and nature of black suffer- ing and of the struggles
--- political, aesthetic, intellectual, and so on --- that have sought
to transform and undo it. What is lost for the study of nonblack
nonwhite existence is a proper analysis of the true scale and nature of
its material and symbolic power relative to the category of blackness.76

[This is why **[every attempt to defend the rights]{.mark} and
liberties** of the latest victims of state repression **[will
fail]{.mark}** to make substantial gains [inso- far **as it
forfeits**]{.mark} **or sidelines [the fate of blacks]{.mark}**,
[the]{.mark} prototypical [targets of **the panoply of police
practices** and]{.mark} the **[juridical infrastructure]{.mark} built up
around them**]{.underline}. [Without blacks on board, [the only viable
political option]{.mark} and the only effective defense against the
intensifying cross fire will [involve **greater alliance with an
antiblack civil society**]{.mark} and **further capitulation to the
magnification of state power**]{.underline}. At the apex of the
midcentury social movements, Kwame Ture and Charles Hamilton wrote in
their 1968 clas- sic, Black Power: The Politics of Liberation, that
[black freedom entails "the necessarily **total revamping of the
society**]{.underline}."77 For Hartman, thinking of the entanglements of
the African diaspora in this context, [[the]{.mark} necessarily total
[revamping of the society is]{.mark} more appropriately [envisioned as
**the creation of a**]{.mark}**n entirely [new
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}[:]{.mark}

I knew that no matter how far from home I traveled, I would never be
able to leave my past behind. I would never be able to imagine being the
kind of person who had not been made and marked by slavery. I was black
and a history of terror had produced that identity[. Terror was
"captivity without the possibility of flight," inescapable violence,
precarious life. There was no going back to a time or place before
slavery, and going beyond it no doubt would entail nothing less
momentous than yet another revolution]{.underline}.7

#### INFINITE ENSEMBLES---the uncritical laundry-listing of gender, sexuality, race, class, etc etc reproduces the infinite permutations of Whiteness -- it erases the specificity of Blackness and destroys our ability to fight Whiteness -- it must be theorized as a larger ensemble, not in its specific manifestations

Wilderson 10 --

(Frank, Red White & Black, pgs 297-8)

[[**The diversity of Whiteness** is so profound that there are **no
fixed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, always already, **[[positions within
it]{.mark}, no a priori criminality, for example]{.underline}**, and no
permanent saintliness. [[Spatial]{.mark} and temporal [capacity is so
immanent]{.mark} on the field of Whiteness [that
the]{.mark}]{.underline} effects and permutations of its [[ensemble of
questions and the **kinds of White bodies** that can mobilize this
universe]{.mark} of combinations [are **seemingly
infinite**]{.mark}]{.underline} as well: [White [prostitutes can
catalyze a 180-degree ethical reversal]{.mark}]{.underline} (given that
prostitution is cinema\'s role-of-choice for Black women, one would
expect---if Blacks and Whites were both structurally alive---these
catalytic moments to pop up in every other film!). Even the White dead
can hold the White living to account. We are dealing here with a
structure whose idiom of power is auto didactic and auto productive: it
generates its lessons, its ensemble of questions and their attendant
ethical dilemmas, and its institutional ca- pacity, internally, without
recourse to bodies or questions beyond its own gene pool. What keeps it
from replicating the decline in genetic health experienced when incest
takes place in biology is the fact that it is not biological.
[[Whiteness has **an infinite ensemble of signified
possibilities**]{.mark}: [The]{.mark} **infinite [possibilities]{.mark}
themselves [cannot be definitively named]{.mark}**; their dramas of
value cannot be predicted with anything approaching precision; nor can
the reproduction of these possibilities be threatened with mortality,
because **[Whiteness\'s internal mutation is
limitless]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [**But [what can be named, predicted,
and put to death is the coherence of the ensemble as an
ensemble]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And **[[the same thing that guarantees
the ensemble\'s coherence is the thing that threatens its coherence with
destruction: the Black.]{.underline}]{.mark}**¶ [[The diversity of
Whiteness]{.mark}, its \"recovery of difference in a hierarchical and
vertical distribution of being,\" **[depends on the \"laterality\" of
Blackness to maintain its internal
diversity]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Hortense [Spillers uses the
term laterality to mean that whereas [Whiteness exists on a vertical
plane where]{.mark}]{.underline} the \"recovery of
[[difference]{.underline}\" [is]{.underline}]{.mark} [not only
guaranteed, but [ethically mandated]{.mark}, [Blackness exists]{.mark}
on a lateral plane [where \"it \[is\] possible to rank human with

would indeed be dismantled as a taxonomy if \"White person\" were added
to the list; but it would merely be expanded if \"Black person\" were
added to the list. Blacks, broadly speaking, connote a taxonomy of
things]{.underline}. As Ronald Judy asks, in a question I used as an
epigraph for chapter 1 0 , \"Can there be a community\' of niggers, as
opposed to a \'bunch\' or a collection\'?\" \"In effect, the humanity of
the African personality is placed in quotation marks under . . . signs\"

case. Queer Palestinians are fundamentally fighting a decolonization
struggle where the political ask is for the actual unsettlement of
foreign peoples and the right of return to land. It was easy for us to
agree with this demand in Palestine, and yet harder and more necessary
for us to approach North American queer politics with unsettlement as a

this country, our families remained silent and continued to succeed on

loss, trauma, and a sense of displacement. What this does is distract
away from our mutual complicity in violence against Native Americans and

privileged diasporic people of color we have to reframe and rearticulate
the ways we narrate our immigration toward mutual
accountability.]{.underline} **[We must not only see ourselves as

[The most general statement of our politics at the present]{.underline}
time [would be that we]{.underline} are actively committed to struggling
against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class oppression and [see as
our particular task the development of integrated analysis and practice
based upon the fact that the major systems of oppression are
interlocking]{.underline}. The synthesis of these oppressions creates
the conditions of our lives. As black women we see black feminism as the
logical political movement to combat the manifold and simultaneous
oppressions that all women of color face. -The Combahee River Collective
in A Black Feminist Statement¶ [Many radical movement builders are
well-versed in the theory of intersectionality.]{.underline} Feminists,
queer theorists and activists, critical race scholars, progressive
activists, and the like owe much to our Black feminist sisters, like The
Combahee River Collective, who introduced us to the reality of
simultaneity--as a framework for assessing the multitude of interlocking
oppressions that impact the lives of women of color--in A Black Feminist
Statement (1978). Their voices and politics presaged Kimberlé Crenshaw's
very useful theoretical contribution of "intersectionality" to the
feminist toolkit of political interventions in 1989.¶ Since its
inception, [many have referenced the term]{.underline}---sometimes
without attribution to the black feminist intellectual genealogy from
which it emerged---[as a form of en vogue progressive
parlance.]{.underline} [In fact, it seems to be the case that it is
often referenced in progressive circles as a counterfeit
license]{.underline} (as in, "I understand the ways that race,
sexuality, class, and gender coalesce. I get it. I really do.") [to
enter resistance work even if the person who declares to have a deep
"understanding" of the connectedness of systemic matrices of
oppression]{.underline}, themselves, [have yet to discern and address
their own complicity in the maintenance of the very oppressions they
seek to name and demolish]{.underline}. [I am certain that I am not the
only person who has heard a person use language embedded with race,
class, gender, or ability privilege follow-up with a reference to
"intersectionality]{.underline}."¶ My concern, then, has everything to
do with the way that [the fashioning of intersectionality as a political
framework can lead]{.underline} toward the good work of analyzing
ideological and material systems of oppression---as they function "out
there"---[and away from the great work of critical analyses of the ways
in which we,]{.underline} ourselves[, can function as actants in the
narratives of counter-resistance that we rehears]{.underline}e. In other
words, [we might be missing the opportunity to read our complicities,
our privileges, our accesses, our excesses, our excuses, our modes of
oppressing]{.underline}---located "in here"---as they occupy each of
us.¶ Crenshaw's theorization has provided us with a useful lens to
assess the problematics of the interrelated, interlocking apparatuses of
power and privilege and their resulting epiphenomena of powerlessness
and subjugation. Many have focused on the external dimensions of
oppression and their material results manifested in the lives of the
marginalized, but might our times be asking of us to deeply consider our
own "stuff" that might instigate such oppressions?¶ What if we extended
Crenshaw's theory of intersectionality by invoking what we might name
"intralocality"? Borrowing from sociologists, the term "social
location," which broadly speaks to one's context, highlights one's
standpoint(s)---the social spaces where s/he is positioned (i.e. race,
class, gender, geographical, etc.). [Intralocality]{.underline}, then,
[is concerned with the social locations that foreground our knowing and
experiencing of our world and our relationships to the systems and
people within our world]{.underline}. [Intralocality is a call to
theorize the self in relation to power and privilege, powerlessness and
subjugation]{.underline}. [It is work that requires the locating of the
"I" in the intersection]{.underline}. And while it could be argued that
such work is highly individualistic, I contend that [it is at the very
level of self-in-relation-to-community where communal transformation is
made possible]{.underline}.

### at: black/white binary bad

#### Their desire to go beyond the black white binary simply strengthens anti blackness. We must start with analysis of the slave to every have truly meaningful cross racial political analysis -- the impact is anti blackness

Our organizing can also reflect anti-Black racism. Recently, with the
out- growth of \"multiculturalism\" there have been calls to \"go beyond
the black/white binary\" and include other communities of color in our
analysis, as presented in the third scenario. There are a number of
flaws with this analysis. First, it replaces an analysis of white
supremacy with a politics of multicultural representation; if we just
include more people, then our practice will be less racist. Not true.
This model does not address the nuanced structure of white supremacy,
such as through these distinct logics of slavery, genocide, and
Orientalism. Second, it obscures the centrality of the slavery logic in
the system of white supremacy, which is based on a black/white binary.
[**[The black/white binary]{.mark}** is not the only binary which
characterizes white supremacy]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} it
[**[is]{.mark}** still a **[centra]{.mark}l** one]{.underline} that we
cannot \"go beyond\" in our racial justice organizing efforts. If we do
not look at how the logic of slaveability inflects our society and our
thinking, it will be evident in our work as well. For example, other
communities of color often appropriate the cultural work and organizing
strategies of African American civil rights or Black Power movements
without corresponding assumptions that we should also be in solidarity
with Black communities. We assume that this work is the common
\"property of all oppressed groups, and we can appropriate it without
being accountable. Angela P. Harris and Juan Perea debate the usefulness
of the black/white binary in the book, Critical Race Theory. Perea
complains that the black/white binary fails to include the experiences
of other people of color. However, he fails to identify alternative
racializing logics to the black/white paradigm. Meanwhile, Angela P.
Harris argues that \"the story of \'race\' itself is that of the
construction of Blackness and whiteness. In this story, Indians, Asian
Americans, and Latinos do exist. But their roles are subsidiary to the
fundamental binary national drama. As a political claim, Black
exceptionalism exposes the deep mistrust and tensions among American
ethnic groups racialized as nonwhite.\"\~ Let\'s examine these
statements in conversation with each other. Simply saying we need to
move beyond the black/white binary (or perhaps, the \"black/non- black\"
binary) in US racism obfuscates the racializing logic of slavery, and
prevents us from seeing that this binary constitutes Blackness as the
bottom of a color hierarchy. [**However, this is not the only
binary**]{.underline} that fundamentally constitutes white supremacy.
[[There is]{.mark} also [an **indigenous/settler
binary**]{.mark}]{.underline}, where Native genocide is central to the
logic of white supremacy and other non-indigenous people of color also
form \"a subsidiary\" role. [We [also]{.mark} face]{.underline} another
[[**Orientalist logic** that]{.mark}]{.underline} fundamentally
[[constitutes Asians, Arabs, and Latinos as]{.mark} foreign [threats,
requiring]{.mark} the United States to be at **[permanent
war]{.mark}**]{.underline} with these peoples. In this construction,
Black and Narive peoples play subsidiary roles. Clearly the black/white
binary is central to racial and political thought and practice in the
United States, and any understanding of white supremacy must take it
into consideration. However, [if we look at only this binary, we may
misread the dynamics of white supremacy in different
contexts]{.underline}. For example, critical race theorist Cheryl
Harris\'s analysis of whiteness as property reveals this weakness. In
Critical Race Theory, Harris contends that whites have a property
interest in the preservation of whiteness, and seek to deprive those who
are \"tainted\" by Black or Indian blood from these same white property
interests. Harris simply assumes that the positions of African Americans
and American Indians are the same, failing to consider US policies of
forced assimilation and forced whiteness on American Indians. These
policies have become so entrenched that when Native peoples make
political claims, they have been accused of being white. When Andrew
Jackson removed the Cherokee along the Trail of Tears, he argued that
those who did not want removal were really white.7 In contemporary
times, when I was a non-violent witness for the Chippewa spearfishers in
the late 1980s, one of the more frequent slurs whites hurled when the
Chippewa attempted to exercise their treaty-protected right to fish was
that they had white parents, or they were really white. Status
differences between Blacks and Natives are informed by the different
economic positions African Americans and American Indians have in US
society. & African Americans have been traditionally valued for their
labor, hence it is in the interest of the dominant society to have as
many people marked \"Black,\" as possible, thereby maintaining a cheap
labor pool; by contrast, American Indians have been valued for the land
base they occupy, so it is in the interest of dominant society to have
as few people marked \"Indian\" as possible, facilitating access to
Native lands. \"Whiteness\" operates differently under a logic of
genocide than it does from logic of slavery. [[Another
failure]{.mark}]{.underline} of US-based people of color in organizing
[[is]{.mark}]{.underline} that [we]{.underline} often [fall back
on]{.underline} a \"**[[US-centricism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\"
believing that what is happening \"over there\" is less important than
what is happening here. [[We fail to see how the United States maintains
the system of oppression]{.mark}]{.underline} here precisely by tying
our allegiances to the interests of US empire \"over there.\"
Heteropatriarchy and White Supremacy [[**Heteropatriarchy** is the
building block of US empire]{.mark}.]{.underline} In fact, it is the
building block of the nation-state form of governance. Christian Right
authors make these links in their analysis of imperialism and empire.
For example, Christian Right activist and founder of Prison Fellowship
Charles Colson makes the connection between homosexuality and the
nation-state in his analysis of the war on terror, explaining that one
of the causes of terrorism is same-sex marriage: Marriage is the
traditional building block of human society, intended both to unite
couples and bring children into the world . . . There is a natural moral
order for the family . . . the family, led by a married mother and
father, is the best available structure for both child- rearing and
cultural health. Marriage is not a private institution designed solely
for the individual gratification of its participants. If we fail to
enact a Federal Marriage Amendment, we can expect not just more family
breakdown, but also more criminals behind bars and more chaos in our
streets.\" Colson is linking the well-being of US empire to the
well-being of the heteropatriarchal family. He continues: When radical
Islamists see American women abusing Muslim men, as they did in the Abu
Ghraib prison, and when they see news coverage of same-sex couples being
\"married\" in US towns, we make this kind of freedom abhorrent-the kind
they see as a blot on Allah\'s creation. We must preserve traditional
marriage in order to protect the United States from those who would use
our depravity to destroy us? As Ann Burlein argues in Lift High the
Cross, it may be a mistake to argue that the goal of Christian Right
politics is to create a theocracy in the United States. Rather,
Christian Right politics work through the private family (which is coded
as white, patriarchal, and middle class) to create a \"Christian
America.\" She notes that the investment in the private family makes it
difficult for people to invest in more public forms of social
connection. In addition, investment in the suburban private family
serves to mask the public disinvestment in urban areas that makes the
suburban lifestyle possible. The social decay in urban areas that
results from this disinvestment is then construed as the result of
deviance from the Christian family ideal rather than as the result of
political and economic forces. As former head of the Christian
Coalition, Ralph Reed, states: \"\'The only true solution to crime is to
restore the family,\"10 and \"Family break-up causes poverty.\"\"
Concludes Burlein, \"[[\'The family\' is]{.mark} no mere metaphor but [a
crucial technology by which]{.mark} modern [power is produced and
exercised]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"\'\* As I have argued elsewhere, in
order to colonize peoples whose societies are nor based on social
hierarchy, colonizers must first naturalize hierarchy through
instituting patriarchy.13 In turn, [patriarchy rests on a gender binary
system in which only two genders exist]{.underline}, [one dominating the
other]{.underline}. Consequently, Charles Colson is correct when he says
that the colonial world order depends on heteronormativity. [[Just
as]{.mark} the [patriarchs rule the family, the elites of the
nation-state rule their citizens. **Any liberation struggle that does
not challenge heteronormativity cannot substantially challenge
colonialism or white supremacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, as Cathy
Cohen contends, such struggles will maintain colonialism based on a
politics of secondary marginalization where the most elite class of
these groups will further their aspirations on the backs of those most
marginalized within the community. Through this process of secondary
marginalization, the national or racial justice struggle takes on either
implicitly or explicitly a nation-state model as the end point of its
struggle-a model of governance in which the elites govern the rest
through violence and domination, as well as exclude those who are not
members of \"the nation.\" Thus, national liberation politics become
less vulnerable to being coopted by the Right when we base them on a
model of liberation that fundamentally challenges right-wing conceptions
of nation. We need a model based on community relationships and on
mutual respect.

[[Muscogee Creek/Seminole woman]{.underline}]{.mark} (YES, I am
enrolled/CDIB carrying) [[from the Skunk clan]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
a daughter of the Bear clan. [[I was raised and still reside in my
community; i'm a ceremonial practitioner and a language
revitalizationist.]{.underline}]{.mark} My family has maintained strong
ties and leadership roles in Muscogee ceremonial, church, and political
life. [[I hold a degree in Native Studies from the University of
Oklahoma]{.underline}]{.mark}. I am not interested in entertaining silly
online identity attacks that seem to consume your academic careers in
order to make you feel personally more authenticated as Indigenous
persons, HOWEVER, Andrea Smith is a long time dear friend of my family
and your actions are beyond offensive and belittling to someone we
deeply care about. Thus, I wish to lend my support to Andy by speaking
truth while you all continue to act as bullies and process your own
insecurities. I want to point out that [[my family has long visited
Cherokee ceremonial grounds]{.mark} (quite regularly during some
seasons) to lend support in participation [just as Cherokee ceremonial
practitioners have long done the same during our Muscogee ceremonial
dances. **I have never seen any** ]{.mark}]{.underline}of these
**[[Andrea Smith-attackers in attendance at Cherokee ceremonies; none of
them are Cherokee speakers nor are they ceremonial
practitioners]{.underline}]{.mark}**; most of these folks are of minimal
blood quantum and look white. In fact, these very kind of identity
police are who traditional ceremonial practitioners get a good laugh at.
I should also make a disclaimer here that [**[I do not uphold
blood-quantum,]{.mark}** tribal [**enrollment and phenotype** as
authenticating markers of Indigenous identity;]{.mark} I am however very
much aware that [the only factor distinguishing]{.mark} Andrea [Smith
from her attackers is a tribal enrollment card. What else signifies
these attackers as Indigenous? **Who employed them as the authority on
Cherokee identity? It certainly** **wasn't the grass roots Cherokee
persons with whom I fellowship.**]{.mark}]{.underline} If I felt like
participating in [these kinds of colonial games]{.underline} instead of
working to save my language from extinction and participating in my
ceremonies in order to maintain the essence of my Muscogee identity, I
would endeavor to call out all of these insecure "native" academics on
their whiteness. Why do these attackers not speak their languages? Why
weren't they raised in traditional ceremonial ways? Why are they living
far from their communities to pursue selfish academic positions? It's
because life is complicated! Moreover, historical realities are often
ugly. For these same reasons I even find compassion for these hateful
acting persons. [[Just because]{.mark} Andrea [Smith's ancestors did not
enroll]{.mark} in the Cherokee Nation [during the Dawes era does not
mean she does not have the right to identify as Cherokee]{.mark}. It
sounds as though you all are upholding Cherokee enrollment
as]{.underline} the ultimate standard for Cherokee identity and the
right to claim Cherokee identity. If so, that means you uphold an
individual with a blood quantum of 1/4,096 (the last I heard it was the
lowest recorded Cherokee Nation blood quantum, meaning the last
full-blood in the family was 15 generations ago), who may have never
even seen or interacted with another native person in their life, [as
somehow more legitimately Indigenous than [an
individual]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[grew up knowing she was
Indigenous from **oral tradition**]{.underline}]{.mark} [(but not
enrolled) [in her family and **accepted a responsibility to engage
social justice advocacy for Indigenous Peoples.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
All academics have shortcomings and it amazes me that you choose to
attack Andy's identity as her shortcoming and take it to this level.
That's the best you could do in finding something to call her out on?
How pitiful. [Why not go after her scholarship, her
arguments?]{.underline} Oh yeah, [because they're
brilliant!]{.underline} And [[her work is used in]{.mark} both [grass
roots]{.mark} organizing [spaces]{.mark} and academic settings.
**[Testimonies of Indigenous female rape survivors have asserted Andy's
work to be healing and empowering]{.mark}**]{.underline}[**.**]{.mark}
Andrea and her sister Justine have both been extraordinarily positive
voices in my life as well as other members of my family. This also rings
true during times of hardship when their words have been encouraging and
they have been physically present in our lives.....oh, remember that I
said i'm a FULL-BLOOD (black haired-brown skinned-Indian looking
individual unlike the rest of these
insecure-in-your-identity-academic-mixed-bloods who I would not have
criticized until you decided to exercise identity policing) which means
that [[Andrea does hang]{.mark} out [with Native People, contrary
to]{.mark} previous [blogging claims]{.mark} that she does not hang
around other Natives. [Many others can attest to that as
well]{.mark}.]{.underline} As we say in Muscogee, "mistvlke fekcahke
owet fullet owes" (they are going about in a jealous way). I guess if my
academic scholarship was lacking, I might also develop jealousy toward
Andrea Smith. So, [[attacking her identity on grounds of not having an
enrollment card and "misrepresenting herself"]{.mark} is an easy target
eaten up by non-grass roots Indigenous Peoples and is something that
only mainstream whites and insecure Natives seem to care about. [It is
obvious]{.mark} that [these attackers do not know Andrea]{.mark} and her
personal family challenges, particularly those surrounding her lineage.
[Trying to survive in academia can be brutal in Native Studies]{.mark}
arenas [where everyone wants to be Indianer-than-thou. I am altogether
compassionate toward her claim/misunderstanding about enrollment in the
Cherokee Nation]{.mark}]{.underline}. That doesn't dismiss her
exceptional work, commitment to social justice and desire to end global
oppression. Andrea does not claim to be a Cherokee cultural or language
expert and these attackers evidently have fooled folks into thinking
they are somehow culturally and linguistically superior to Andy in their
Native identity. Wow, that's a joke! [[Andrea has not used her Cherokee
identity]{.mark} as a way [to promote herself; rather, she identifies
with what she was told her identity is growing up and she participates
in social justice advocacy- for people other than
herself]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, she went to law school to defend
those who cannot defend themselves. [[Andrea has made INCREDIBLE
personal sacrifices]{.underline}]{.mark} for her family and herself in
order [[to fight for justice]{.underline}]{.mark}, and anyone that
attempts to discredit her clearly does not get the whole picture. The
virtues of my Muscogee People (vnokeckv, eyasketv, mehenwv, kvncvpkv) do
not support this kind of hateful behavior. It sounds like most of these
attackers are without traditional teachings from their respective
nations; they have yet to learn how to live on this earth.

#### [Presumption]{.underline} should go toward Smith- [the politics of passing is different for Natives than other marginalized groups]{.underline}- the [biggest danger]{.underline} from settler colonialism is [eliminating Natives by denying them identity]{.underline}- which means you should always err against authenticity tests.

accessed 10-2-15\]

Let me begin by stating that the recent comparisons between Rachel
Dolezal and Andrea Smith are deeply problematic and troubling for a
number of reasons. 1. [**[Smith]{.underline}**]{.mark} unlike Dolezal
[**[grew up being told she was Cherokee, she did not invent this
identification]{.underline}**]{.mark} as a child. 2. [**[The politics of
tribal enrollment]{.mark}** and citizenship, **[especially within the
Cherokee Nation are deeply politicized, racist,
and]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}in my view
[**[Eurocentric]{.underline}**]{.mark} to say the least (see Sturm,
Blood Politics). 3. Smith has not held official appointments in Native
American Studies, unlike Dolezal who held positions in African American
organizations. While Smith has held positions in Native organizations,
this was not her source of employment. 4. [[Passing functions
differently in Native]{.underline}]{.mark} and Black
[[contexts]{.mark}]{.underline} and while both benefit from supposedly
passing the issue of who is and who is not Indian is much more tied to
[state and **[federal laws]{.mark}**]{.underline} both historic and
contemporary that **[[seek to limit the number of
Indians]{.underline}]{.mark}** while increasing the number of Blacks.
**[[In other words kill the Indian through a paper genocide so no one
can be an Indian]{.underline}]{.mark}** unless the U.S. Government
approves and anyone with Black blood is black according to the U.S.
Government so that they can be thoroughly disenfranchised. 5. [[When the
Cherokee were removed in the 1830s not all]{.mark} Cherokee
[left]{.mark}]{.underline} [[many remained, unrecognized]{.mark} in
their original homelands but we both native and non-native [academics
tend to favor the enrolled to the detriment of the
unrecognized]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(I.e., California Indians
especially in Northern California who are also "Not Indian" like Smith
for the very same reasons). [I'm not going to sugarcoat this. **[Smith
like the Ohlone are Not recognized because of a government system that
seeks to erase Indian people, especially mixed-race
Indians]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This happens throughout the United
States and Latin America where blackness is in fact used to erase Indian
blood, while whiteness in Indian country is rarely questioned. 6. The
problem of the census and enrollment from a critical mixed race
perspective---census takers did not enroll all Indians nor did they even
record the blood quantum of siblings with the same parents in a
consistent manner. In Louisiana, where my father is from the practice of
categorizing mixed race people especially after 1890 focused on making
as many multiracial people into African Americans as possible to
disenfranchise them. This is not to say that these individuals were not
Black, but they were also White/Latin and American Indian. 7. Oral
versus written records. I'm not writing this piece to claim Andrea Smith
is Indian, I am writing it to question the way we have come to
overwhelmingly accept the ways that [[Europeans]{.mark} have [defined
Indianness based on written versus oral forms of "evidence"]{.mark}! For
all we know [Smith could descend from the Cherokee who never left during
removal]{.mark}.]{.underline} I only raise this to say that culture, not
biology should determine identity, but as is the case with mixed race
identity in the black community, it is too tempting to read mixed-race
as fake race. I did attend graduate school with Andrea Smith. I do NOT
know her family or her ethnicity other than what she told me during the
time we were in school together, but my point is [[why did the Cherokee
nation in Oklahoma begin to question her identity]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the first place? [[Was it because of the political questions she was
asking?]{.underline}]{.mark} 8. Disappearing one of "their own"? Whether
Smith is biologically Cherokee or not, [I find it ironic how [whiteness
has so]{.mark} thoroughly [taken hold of the Cherokee Nation in
Oklahoma]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed they are a nation with a
long-standing series of tribal chiefs who were partially and often
predominantly white. Whiteness within the nation has been at the very
least less offensive than blackness (Cherokee freedmen, who like Smith
have been disappeared because supposedly they are NOT Cherokee by blood)
but why disappear a mixed white person in this case when this has not
been the consistent pattern of a nation with no minimum blood quantum?
Did she ask one too many questions? Racial identity politics are tricky
business to say the least but at the end of the day mixed race scholars
argue that culture and cultural participation is what we should use to
determine group membership. [This case of questioning Smith opens up a
set of other larger questions with enormous stakes for the future of
American Indians---who should determine who is an Indian? Many say
tribes have the sovereign right to grant citizenship, but what happens
to tribes like the Ohlone who live without recognition?]{.underline} Are
they Indians? What about nations like unlike the U.S government deny
citizenship on the basis of race or inaccurate or distorted written
records. In the end, how does Smith's work further or take away from
Indian struggles for justice? How do Dolezal's claims serve as an act of
anti-blackness in that she purposefully wanted to perform blackness,
[[no where has Smith romanticized being an Indian]{.underline}]{.mark}
to my knowledge. Let us ask ourselves are we who are grandmothers and
mothers tell us we are or should we be what the government wants us to
be? If it's the latter I fear all the Indians will be gone and soon all
the blacks will follow, albeit for different reasons. PART TWO: One more
note to my earlier post today regarding Andrea Smith. While I believe we
should use her case to raise bigger questions about the politics of
recognition and problematic census rolls I would be remiss if I did not
state that no one should ever, ever claim enrollment status if they know
it is false. As some who comes from unrecognized people I would never
claim enrollment and on this point I can agree that misrepresentation is
an abuse when so many look up to a person who is by all rights
"representing" a Native nation or Native issues period. It is a sad day
in many ways and I appreciate and thank colleagues who are taking up the
issue from many very honest and difficult vantage points. PART THREE:
I'd like to further clarify my post yesterday about Andrea Smith. My
comments were not meant as a defense of her knowingly claiming to be an
enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. My post was about
what issues make it possible for someone to be denied or granted
citizenship and how are current systems deeply flawed and how racial
mixing has been used to deny citizenship and erase some people who are
Native because no records exist. It's really a simple question. Was
every person of Cherokee/American Indian descent counted? If not could
there be folks who claim Native identities based on oral traditions that
have no written documentation? Could Andrea Smith be one of these
people? I'm not saying whether she is or is not. I was raised not to
question people's identity. That is between them and their
community(ies). My reference to policing is really a question about why
we as academics are engaging in questioning the identity of another
person and their integrity? As a legal issue hasn't this already been
decided? Do these discussions take away from the real entity that gets
to decide---the tribe? At any rate as I've said it I'm not defending nor
critiquing the choices she made. I don't believe it's my place to do so.
I will say that collectively perhaps as a Native Academic community
there is a responsibility to the communities we serve to ensure that
indigenous peoples are not being represented in ways that are NOT of
their own choosing. My point here was not to say without a doubt that
Andy is mixed-race or even Native. My larger point was who gets to
decide? The Cherokee Nation decides but are there problems with how
people have been included and excluded from the nation on the basis of
racial mixing? My point is we don't know if she was raised
Native/Cherokee or not and I was merely suggesting that [[there could be
legitimate reasons why her family has no paper
trail]{.underline}.]{.mark} The only two plausible reasons- [she has no
ancestry or [the paper work for her family like many Indian people just
isn't in the records]{.mark} and we do know that [this happened a lot
even among tribes with great records]{.mark}]{.underline}. How [many
Natives reading this have relatives and ancestors who had an incorrect
BQ or none listed at all? I used unrecognized tribes like the Ohlone to
suggest a similar problem with [written records not always under the
control of the tribes themselves]{.mark}.]{.underline} [All **[this
language we are using is not from us, it comes from a Western,
essentialist construct]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} But I do often
feel as many of you do that academia is not necessarily the place where
change really happens because in the end whether she is or isn't Indian
or mixed and whatever the reason for her actions---what will change
other than she won't be considered Indian anymore? That she will no
longer be a "Native" academic. This is also an opportunity for all of us
to ask ourselves what does it mean to be a Native academic and who/what
are responsible for? All other Native academics? All tribes? Just our
specific tribes? The tribes located in the regions where we work and
live? [[This is not the first case and it probably isn't the
last]{.underline}]{.mark} and certainly not the last among "Cherokee"
academics...there will be more ([[there have already been
whispers]{.underline}]{.mark} about other prominent figures) so [[this
is why I chose to focus on the larger, structural]{.underline}]{.mark}
and systemic [[problems]{.underline}]{.mark} related to BQ and census
records. How in all of this do we bring kinship, clan, cultural
participation and family back into the conversation to also get more
Native students, faculty, staff, and administrators in higher education
if that's what they/we want to do? And how will engaging with academia
benefit our home communities, territories, and nations. [[We owe it to
the coming generations of Native scholars to create spaces, where their
multiple identities are not cause for concern that **they too will be
chased away**]{.underline}.]{.mark} In the end it is up to our families
and communities to determine our identities. [[I have heard from
students all acr**oss the** country since]{.underline}]{.mark} writing
[[my statements and many]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[expressed]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[gratitude for the perspective
and **fear**]{.underline}]{.mark}/concern [**[for their own
well-being]{.mark}**]{.underline} as they pursue their own academic
careers. [[So let us elevate our discussion to focus not on individuals,
but]{.underline}]{.mark} rather on institutions and [[structural
practices]{.underline}]{.mark} that continue to marginalize Native
peoples.

[[Of all myths associated with American Indians no myth is as pervasive
as the]{.mark} myth of the [vanishing Indian]{.mark}.]{.underline} We
are all familiar with many of the other myths that were invented over
the last 500 years and thanks to the work of Native activists, writers,
intellectuals, and their allies we have begun to dismantle some of them
in meaningful ways. Take for example the myth of Columbus as the
discoverer of America. Campaigns over the last couple of decades in the
United States have led to changes at the level of local and state
governments to repudiate the veneration of Columbus as a hero and
instead recognize indigenous peoples on October 12. Despite the fact
that it is still a national holiday it seems entirely possible that the
day will come when it will be no longer. In another example, with each
passing year we see more and more media coverage on the mythic nature of
the conventional Thanksgiving narrative. Not all Americans may
understand the nuances of what makes this story largely a myth, but with
each passing year there seems to be a growing sense in the general
public that there is little truth to the story they grew up with. [The
vanishing Indian myth]{.underline}, on the other hand, [is]{.underline}
far more [intractable because it has so many different
manifestations.]{.underline} The reason for this is because of **[[the
inherent nature of the settler state]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which
[**[is to eliminate the Native.]{.mark}** This it does in a huge variety
of ways, and [because it is woven throughout the social fabric of the
settler state it is well concealed.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even before the
United States was created [[European immigrants counted on the
disappearance of the indigenous population because they wanted the
land]{.mark}, and so they narrated the reality they wanted to see as
soon as they got here.]{.underline} [It's recognizable through every era
of post-contact North America and has been written into every aspect of
American history]{.underline}. First Indians were disappearing due to
mass epidemics. Then they were disappearing through slavery. They were
disappearing by being pushed out of their territories. They were
disappearing through massacres and other acts of violence. By the end of
the nineteenth century when the vanishing Native myth reached its
crescendo and most Indians had been contained on reservations,
disappearance took the form of culturecide by assimilation. Thanks to
the boarding school system which killed the Indian but saved the man,
Indians throughout the twentieth century were disappearing through
trauma and identity murder. Trauma---from shame induced by the boarding
schools, for example---caused many Native people to deny their heritage
in order to survive racism, contributing to what I call identity murder.
[[**Identity murder is one of the most common (and insidious) modes of
Native disappearance today.** It]{.underline}]{.mark} takes many forms
within American culture, and [[is always based on definitions of the
"real" Indian.]{.underline}]{.mark} Real Indians dress like Indians.
[[Real Indians live on reservations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Real Indians
have reservations. Real Indians are full blood. Real Indians are at
least half blood. [[Real Indians are enrolled. Real Indians know their
language. Real Indians practice their ceremonies.]{.mark} Real Indians
have dark skin and long black hair.]{.underline} The list goes on, and
it isn't based on any sense of logic. [[These]{.mark} impossible
[criteria are markers of authenticity]{.mark} and [those who fail to
meet them]{.mark} are deemed inauthentic]{.underline}, either in the
minds of individuals or in governmental institutions. [They [are]{.mark}
effectively [eliminated as Natives]{.mark}.]{.underline} Blood quantum
is perhaps the biggest determinant of Indian authenticity, but even
those who are full blood can be deemed not real based on some
stereotypes or legal definitions of what real Indians are. All Indians
are subject to being judged for their authenticity, and even despite
high blood quantum or enrolled status they can be deemed inauthentic
simply by virtue of the fact that they live in the modern world. Because
after all, the real Indians were the ones who dressed in buckskins and
hunted buffalo and deer for their living, and didn't speak English. And
they've been gone a long time. **[[Non-natives, whether they know it or
not, are conditioned to determine the authenticity of Native
people]{.underline}]{.mark}** whenever they encounter them, especially
those that live in places where Indians are highly invisible, like large
cities or in states with low Native populations. [Because they have been
indoctrinated with the idea of the vanishing Native their whole lives,
[the assumption that there is no such thing as real Natives]{.mark}
anymore [is like a software program constantly running in the
background. So when they meet someone who claims to be Native, the
unconscious impulse is to automatically determine the truth of the
claim]{.mark}.]{.underline} They do this by asking how much Indian blood
you have. And depending on your physical characteristics, they'll either
say that "you look it," or that "gee, I don't see it." Your authenticity
as a Native person is thus based on your appearance, not on who you
actually are. [For you non-Native readers, keep this in
mind.]{.underline} Native people rarely ask each other about their blood
degree because they know that being Native is not about an abstract
mathematical equation that parses out their identity into measurable
fractions. When you demand to know how much "Indian blood" someone has,
whether you realize it or not you are presuming the untruth of their
identity claims, which is why the question can be so offensive. But most
Native people don't mind talking about who they are, so instead ask what
Native nation they are from. That opens the door for a broader dialogue
without subtly accusing them of a fake identity.
