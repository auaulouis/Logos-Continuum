Since 2006, the previous position of [the **D**epartment **o**f
**S**tate]{.underline}, which originally had the lead in funding (and
therefore some influence in controlling) these activities, [has been
**eclipsed**]{.underline}. [While it continues to control funding
for]{.underline} its many [Title 22]{.underline} programs, [they are
largely **executed** via **DSCA** and the **MILDEPs**]{.underline}.
Although Congress has recognized that [it]{.underline} has, in effect,
[created]{.underline} [the basis for **confusion** via the two
departments' dual]{.underline} congressionally [mandated authorities and
authorizations]{.underline}, a political decision to create a clear lead
agent for these activities remains missing. One will return to the U.S.
Government's well-used practice of "fudging" when it comes to
identifying who's in charge.
