**[2AC \-\-- Liberalism]{.underline}**

**Even if political liberalism currently excludes the disabled,
discussing questions of implementation can revise it**

and the justice claims of the disabled: a reconciliation," Critical

I argue that any proposal [[abandoning the language of political justice
would not]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to [[do enough for]{.mark} those
[individuals with disabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} who fall outside the
basic idea of persons as depicted by Rawls. In fact, the intuitions
supporting [the idea that concepts like rights and opportunities are
indispensable are very strong.]{.underline}11 Let us go back to the
examples of individuals falling outside Rawls's idea of persons because
their disabilities prevent them from being a net beneﬁt to social
cooperation. [They are [individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} who need
multiple carers to work, or [[whose disabilities prevent them from
providing a beneﬁt to social cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} that is
large enough. To put the point more sharply, it is worth noticing that
the disabilities in question are compatible with being in full
possession of one's logical and moral powers. Now, **[[should we
accept]{.mark} that [those individuals ought to be given no
rights]{.mark} or opportunities?]{.underline}** An afﬁrmative answer
would strike us as implausible, and for a good reason. In [a liberal
society, having one's rights, opportunities and]{.underline} basic
distributive [entitlements acknowledged is one and the same as being
recognized as an equal.]{.underline} And what is missing from Rawls's
political liberalism is precisely the idea that falling below a
threshold of full cooperation should not be enough to prevent the
disabled from being regarded as persons on an equal footing with anyone
else. In sum, [Rawls's political liberalism is not amenable to any
extension that,]{.underline} keeping the basic ideas of society and
persons intact, [is able to include a concern with the status of
individuals with disabilities.]{.underline} In addition, the proposal
that the interests of the disabled are not for public reason to protect
is not satisfactory. [Consequently, a]{.underline} substantial
**[[revision is the only way to reconcile political liberalism
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** our intuitions concerning **[[what is due to
the disabled]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 5. Revising political liberalism I:
beyond Hartley's contractualism The aim of this section and the next is
to propose a substantial revision of Rawls's theory that accommodates
the justice claims of the disabled while upholding the project of
political liberalism. [A question that needs to be answered]{.underline}
at this point [is: **why should we uphold**]{.underline} the project of
[**political liberalism, rather than endorsing a different model** that
more neatly ﬁts with our]{.underline} intuitions concerning [what is due
to the disabled**?**]{.underline} First, the general project of
[[political liberalism is compelling]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rawls's
political liberalism aims to identify a common ground of political ideas
that can work as the basis on which the most important political
decisions should be made. [This project is of the greatest importance
because]{.underline}, if successful, [[it creates legitimacy by building
institutions on the basis of concepts]{.mark} that are [acceptable to
each]{.mark}]{.underline} reasonable [[individual]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Moreover, it promotes stability in societies that are characterized by
deep pluralism. Second, [[despite Rawls's failure to take]{.mark} the
interests of [the disabled into consideration,]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[political liberalism is well suited to support the justice claims of
individuals with disabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is because
[the idea that the disabled are citizens who deserve our respect is part
of the common culture]{.underline} of our societies. In other words,
there is an overlapping consensus on the idea that rights, opportunities
and distributive shares must be granted to individuals who are not fully
cooperating members of society, including those who fall below full
moral powers. It is widely believed that [[those with]{.mark} physical
[disabilities should have the same rights as]{.mark} their [fellow
citizens, live in a social environment that does
not]{.mark}]{.underline} excessively [[limit their opportunities and
receive beneﬁts that]{.mark} help [meet their]{.mark}]{.underline}
special [[needs]{.mark}.]{.underline} Besides, although the state or
third parties are given exceptional rights to interfere with the
autonomy of individuals with severe cognitive disabilities, [it is
widely recognized that the mentally disabled are citizens whose basic
interests must be protected by the law.]{.underline}12 In the public
space, any proposal that individuals who are not fully cooperating
members of society should have their basic interests neglected would be
widely received with outrage. Such proposal would be said to ﬁt a
fascist society, not a decent one. Among other legal documents, the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN
General Assembly, A/61/611) can be taken as the epitome of this
widespread attitude. Adopted in 2006, the Convention requires that all
individuals with disabilities should share in the enjoyment of equal
fundamental rights.

meaning]{.underline} any [substantive discussion]{.underline} that does
occur [is extremely rare.]{.underline} I suspect many people I talk to
about disability maintain an implicit hope that, if they nod as
vigorously as possible, the issue will simply go away. In this way,
support for [[disability rights]{.underline}]{.mark} is similar to the
act of expressing perfunctory thanks to military veterans. It
temporarily [[absolves us of]{.mark} the [responsibility]{.mark} to
address the heart of the matter.]{.underline} Moreover, the apparent
moral consensus may be mostly superficial. In trying to enact
accessibility, disability advocates encounter increasing resistance as
the effort and costs involved in proposals come closer to being
realized. (Consider the neighborhood store that decides it's just too
costly to install a ramp, or the community lecture that excludes deaf
attendees by refusing to hire a sign-language interpreter.) Instead of
facilitating change, false unity actually restrains change. It stifles
the more substantive conversations true progress requires. And our
inability to speak honestly --- and contentiously --- about disability
shows how the politics of disability is in this sense non-political. We
are the worse for it. [In addition to greater participation in the
public sphere, true progress for citizens with disabilities will require
a willingness to confront the issues head-on]{.underline}, even when ---
especially when --- citizens disagree on competing solutions. **[[We
must politicize disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- not in the
cable-news, grandstanding kind of way, but in the term's more formal
sense. The work of the Belgian political theorist Chantal Mouffe can
help illuminate what's at stake. Mouffe begins with the premise that
human relations are inherently antagonistic: Political change always
requires controversial transfers in power or prestige, and it is an
illusion to imagine politics without confrontation. Per this "agonistic"
conception of democracy, a healthy political order is one that prefers
vigorous, good-faith argumentation to complacent consensus. Until we
publicly recognize real disagreements surrounding disability and
accessibility, Mouffe would insist, we are doomed to a vacuous, empty
debate that is neither political nor productive. Recall the Kovaleski
incident. I'm not suggesting that the abhorrence of Mr. Trump's actions
is open to legitimate questioning. But [in their forcefully reassuring
comments and messages, my friends prevented any serious discussion of
disability at the level where reasonable disagreement does exist. Where
will the money come from to fund disability employment schemes? **[How
do we even define "disability"?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Despite --- and,
I would argue, partly [[because of]{.mark} --- the [broad
condemnation]{.mark}]{.underline} of Mr. Trump for his insensitivity,
[[there was no substantive public discussion]{.mark} of such
issues.]{.underline} You may be thinking, haven't we had enough politics
lately? Maybe it's a blessing that disability isn't as political as it
might be; it avoids the drama and messiness that now seem to define our
common life. Avoiding politics might be possible if
[[disability]{.underline}]{.mark} were an exclusively private affair.
But it [[is]{.mark} fundamentally [a public
concern]{.mark}]{.underline}, affecting everyone directly or indirectly
and revealing our obligations to one another as members of a democratic
society. [Issues of accessibility can be fully addressed only through
public institutions and collective effort. For the disability community,
there is no answer but politics.]{.underline} But [politics need not be
repulsive.]{.underline} That's the beauty of Mouffe's agonism: [By
legitimating clashing arguments and welcoming them into the political
fold, unproductive antagonism becomes constructive]{.underline}, and
compromises emerge.

**Vehmas & Watson 13** (Simo Vehmas & Nick Watson, "Moral wrongs,
disadvantages, and disability: a critique of critical disability
studies", p. 642-643)

\*CDS = Critical Disability Studies

[CDS does not engage with ethical issues to do with the role of
impairment and disability in people's well-being and the pragmatic and
mundane issues of day-today living.]{.underline} Imagine,
[for]{.underline} example, a pregnant woman who has agreed, possibly
with very little thought, to the routine of prenatal diagnostics, and
who has been informed that [the fetus]{.underline} she is
[carrying]{.underline} has [Tay-Sachs disease.]{.underline} She now has
to make the decision over [whether to terminate the
pregnancy]{.underline} or carry it to term. The value judgements that
surround Tay-Sachs include the fact that it will cause pain and
suffering to the child and he or she will probably die before the age of
four. These [are morally relevant considerations to the mother. Whilst
CDS would probably guide her to confront ableist assumptions and
challenge her beliefs about the condition, **[considerations]{.mark}
having [to do with]{.mark} pain and [suffering are]{.mark} nevertheless
[morally significant]{.mark}.** The way people see things, and the
language that is used to describe certain conditions, can affect how
they react to them, but [freeing oneself from ableist assumptions **may
not in some cases be enough.**]{.mark} There may be insurmountable
realities attached to some impairments]{.underline} where parents feel
that their personal and social circumstances would not enable them to
provide the child or themselves with a satisfactory life (Vehmas 2003).
Impairment sometimes produces practical, difficult ethical choices and
[[we need more concrete viewpoints]{.mark} than the ideas provided
through ableism, which offers very little practical moral
guidance.]{.underline} It is questionable whether the notion of ableism
would help the parents in deciding whether to have a child who has a
degenerative condition that results in early death. Campbell (2009a, 39,
149 and 159), for example, discusses arguments about impairments as
harmful conditions, the ethics of external bodily transplants as well as
wrongful birth and life court cases (whether life with an impairment is
preferable to non-existence), and how ableism impacts on discourse
around these issues. Whilst her analysis of such ableist discourses
suggests ethical judgements, she provides no arguments or conclusions as
to whether, for example, external bodily transplants are ethically wrong
or whether impairment may or may not constitute a moral harm. Under the
anti-dualistic stance adopted by CDS, even [the well-being/ill-being
dualism becomes an arbitrary]{.underline} and nonsensical
[construct]{.underline}. Under ableism it can be constructed as merely
maintaining the dominance of those seemingly faring well (supposedly,
'non-disabled' people), and labels those faring less well as having
lesser value. [[There may not be a clear answer to what]{.mark}
[constitutes]{.mark} human [well-being]{.mark}]{.underline} or
flourishing, [[but in general we can]{.mark} and we need to [agree about
some necessary elements]{.mark}]{.underline} required for well-being.
Also, as moral agents [we have an obligation to make judgements about
people's well-being and act in ways that their well-being is
enhanced]{.underline} (Eshleman 2009). This is why [we
have]{.underline}, for example, [coronary heart disease prevention
programmes because the possible death or associated health problems are
seen as harms]{.underline}. Possibly these policies are based on ableist
perspective, but if that is the case then the normative use of ableism
is null; eradicating supposedly ableist enterprises such as coronary
heart disease prevention would be an example of reductio ad absurdum.
Denying some aspects of well-being are so clear that their denial would
be absurd, and simply morally wrong. [[CDS]{.mark} raises ethical issues
and insinuates normative judgements but [does not provide supporting
ethical arguments. This is]{.mark} a way of [shirking from]{.mark}
intellectual and ethical [responsibility to provide]{.mark}]{.underline}
[sound arguments and [conceptual tools for ethical
decision-making]{.mark} that would benefit disabled people.]{.underline}
If we are to describe disability, disablism, and oppression properly, we
have to explicate the moral and political wrong related to these
phenomena. [Whilst [CDS]{.mark} has produced useful
analyses]{.underline}, for example, of the cultural reproduction of
disability, [**it [needs to engage more closely with the evaluative
issues]{.mark}** inherently related to disability.]{.underline} As Sayer
has argued (against Foucault): while one could hardly disagree that we
should seek to uncover the hidden and unconsidered ideas on which
practices are based, I would argue that critique is indeed exactly about
identifying what things 'are not right as they are', and why. (Sayer

**State action can be good for people with disabilities -- ADA proves**

Disabilities Act transformed a country,\" History,
<https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/americans-disabilities-act-transformed-united-states>
) //RB

[More than 2,000 disability rights advocates gathered on the South Lawn
of the White House in Washington, D.C., on a hot summer day. It was July
26, 1990, and they'd come together to witness one of the most momentous
civil rights victories in decades: President George H.W. Bush signing
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) into law.]{.underline}

During the signing ceremony---days after the Fourth of July---[Bush
admitted that the United States hadn't always lived up to its founding
principles of freedom and equality. "\[T\]ragically, for too many
Americans, the blessings of liberty have been limited or even denied,"
he said. "Today's legislation brings us closer to that day when no
Americans will ever again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."]{.underline}

**[[The ADA not only provided comprehensive civil rights protections for
people with disabilities for the first time in the nation's
history]{.mark}, but it also [marked a sea change in the nation's
attitudes toward disability rights]{.mark}. Here's how the landmark
statute came to be, and how it transformed the country.]{.underline}**

The disability rights movement gains steam

Throughout history, people with disabilities were feared and ridiculed
for their perceived defects and pushed to the margins of society. By the
1960s, that discrimination had been codified. People with disabilities
were excluded from public schools, involuntarily sterilized, sent to
live in state-run institutions, and even denied the right to vote. Some
U.S. municipalities even had so-called "ugly laws" prohibiting people
with "unsightly or disgusting" deformities in public places. It was a
world designed not to include people with disabilities. Government
buildings and private businesses alike lacked ramps and elevators, while
public transportation rarely provided accommodations for people with
mobility or visual impairments. Having a disability was considered a
medical problem to be solved rather than an identity to be protected
under non-discrimination laws. But things began to change in the 1970s.
Inspired by the civil rights movement of the 1960s, disability rights
advocates became more vocal in their demands that their rights ought to
be guaranteed as well. Disability had also become more noticeable as
wars in Vietnam and Korea returned thousands of soldiers with lasting
injuries. In 1973, advocates won the passage of Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act, which prohibited programs receiving federal funding
from discriminating against people with disabilities. It was the first
piece of legislation to use the term "discrimination" to describe the
limitations that these Americans face.

[For the law to go into effect, the government would have to issue
regulations defining who qualifies as a person with a disability and
what constitutes discrimination in the disability context]{.underline}.
The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare put off issuing those
regulations for four years as they wrestled over the terms. Impatient
with the delay---and worried it meant the regulations would be
weakened---advocates organized protests around the country. [In April
1977 they launched a sit-in at a federal building in San Francisco that
would last for 28 days---the longest peaceful occupation of a federal
building in U.S. history---and **result in victory**.]{.underline}

The need for a comprehensive civil rights law

[With Section 504, the American public began to understand that making
accommodations for people with disabilities was a civil right rather
than a welfare benefit.]{.underline} It also galvanized a growing
disability rights movement that won several other important victories in
the 1970s and 1980s---including legislation that guaranteed a free
public education to children with impairments and prohibited housing
discrimination on the basis of disabilities. Yet discrimination
persisted. In 1979, the Supreme Court ruled that the nursing school at
Southeastern Community College in Whiteville, North Carolina, was not
required by Section 504 to accommodate a hearing-impaired applicant. In
other circumstances, regulations were simply not well enforced. For
example, transit authorities were left to decide for themselves how
accessible they needed to be. (A skull discovered in Spain suggests that
early humans cared for disabled children.) In the mid-1980s, advocates
came to the conclusion that the critical next step was to push for
comprehensive civil rights legislation for people with disabilities. The
National Council on Disability commissioned a report on the need for
such a law, while its vice chair Justin Dart---who would later become
known as the "Godfather of the ADA"---embarked on a national tour to
discuss disability policy with local officials and gather stories of the
discrimination people with disabilities faced. These advocacy efforts
made an impression on both sides of the political aisle. Disability
rights had become a bipartisan issue thanks to years of changing public
perceptions. In 1988, Senators Lowell Weicker, a Republican from
Connecticut, and Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, introduced the
Americans with Disabilities Act. After years of revisions, amendments,
and negotiations, the bill was passed, and on that July day Bush---who
had made civil rights legislation for people with disabilities a
campaign promise in 1988---signed it into law with Dart by his side.

[Why the [ADA]{.mark} matters]{.underline}

[The Americans with Disabilities Act was a [sweeping piece of
legislation]{.mark} that [banned]{.mark} [discrimination]{.mark} on the
[basis]{.mark} of [disability]{.mark} in employment, public
accommodations, public services, transportation, and
telecommunication]{.underline}. It finally afforded people with
disabilities the same protections that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had
provided on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national
origin.

\"**[It [is the world's first declaration of equality for people with
disabilities]{.mark},\"]{.underline}** [Dart wrote after the ADA was
passed. \"[It will proclaim to America and to the world that people with
disabilities are fully human;]{.mark} that paternalistic,
discriminatory, segregationist attitudes are no longer acceptable; and
that henceforth people with disabilities must be accorded the same
personal respect and the same social and economic opportunities as other
people.\"]{.underline}

[The [ADA]{.mark} [launched]{.mark} the process of [building a more
accessible world by ensuring that buildings, schools, and public spaces
were equipped with ramps, elevators, and curb cuts.]{.mark}]{.underline}
It [made travel easier by requiring operators to make accommodations,
such as offering wheelchair lifts, airport shuttle service, and rental
cars with hand controls. It also led to the rise of interpreters and
closed captioning in public communications. (These five coastal areas
have made accessibility a priority.)]{.underline}

[Crucially, this [legislation has also become a model for lawmakers and
activists]{.mark} around the world seeking [to end
discrimination]{.mark} against people with disabilities in their
countries. Since 2000, more than 180 countries have passed legislation
inspired by the ADA.]{.underline} The law is limited, however. The ADA
has been criticized for failing to increase employment among people with
disabilities---only 19 percent are in the workforce today compared with
66 percent of those without disabilities. People with disabilities are
still disenfranchised. Accommodations at polling places across the
nation are inadequate; in 2016, a government report found that 60
percent of the polling places it examined had one or more potential
impediments, such as ramps that were dangerously steep or paths in poor
condition. Meanwhile, 39 states and Washington, D.C., have incompetence
laws that allow judges to strip the vote from people they deem incapable
of participating in the democratic process, such as people with mental
impairments. Stigma and discrimination persist throughout society too.
The ADA may not be perfect, but as Dart wrote in 1990, it "is only the
beginning. It is not a solution. Rather, it is an essential foundation
on which solutions will be constructed."

[The [long-term consequences of protracted confl ict on disabled people
and the creation of impairment need more research.]{.mark} This calls
for a longitudinal or life-course approach (Priestley 2007 ) to see how
identities, single and multiple impairment(s), health and social care
needs differ as the age of populations and their environments
change]{.underline}. A life-course approach can also [explore how the
concept of disability is changing intergenerationally]{.underline},
whether passed on biologically (e.g. HIV/AIDS) and socially (e.g.
stigma), or through ascription of a new kinship identity (e.g. amputee)
(Berghs 2012 ). Yet, [research, funding and planning to understand the
long-term effects of confl ict on disability is rarely
available]{.underline} (Wehbi 2011a ). Inhorn and Kobeissi ( 2006 )
usefully note how there are six long-term effects of confl ict on
civilians: physical, mental, reproductive/demographic, social
structural, infrastructural, and environmental. We briefl y discuss each
of these in turn in an effort to illustrate what is missing from current
debates in relation to disability.

Physical [We know very little about civilian deaths and creation of
impairment despite the fact that poorly resourced health systems
contribute to death, illness and impairment]{.underline} (Banatvala and
Zwi 2000 ; WHO 2011 ). With the focus on public health, the effects of
malnutrition, communicable and non-communicable diseases, unsanitary
conditions and lack of access to water are given substantial attention
post-confl ict. For example, Miles and Medi ( 1994 ) [found that while
[confl ict in Mozambique had resulted in impairment among
children]{.mark}, most actually gained indirect impairments due to a mix
of effects created by the [long]{.mark}-[term consequences of the confl
ict]{.mark}, such as malnutrition. Insurance provision, necessary
implementation of user fees for services and a lack of (paid)
professionals, medication, assistive devices, prosthetics and
rehabilitation programmes affect impairment, too]{.underline}. Growing
privatisation under neo-liberalism is also a threat to access to health
and social care services (Berghs 2013 ). Likewise, the impact of
landmines, chemicals and circulation of (small) arms can last for
generations and will need long-term planning of services. Long-term
effects of confl ict and links to impairment need to be identifi ed so
that services can be planned and implemented adequately .

[Mental In post-confl ict situations, there are [increases in mental
health]{.mark} needs such as for counselling, social care and
[specialised psychiatric services]{.mark}.]{.underline} Inhorn and
Kobeissi ( 2006 ) cite lack of infrastructural development and trained
professionals, as well as not prioritising mental health as detrimental
to well-bein[g. The evidence base for many [interventions affecting
disabled people does not exist,]{.mark} especially in the fi eld of
gender-based violence and mental health]{.underline} (Blanchet et al.
2013 ). Likewise, while there is a lot of data on western veterans,
[there is very little information on culturally sensitive, indigenous or
communal interventions for disabled people. Institutionalisation,
stigma, western diagnoses (following the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders 5) and links to pharmaceutical companies also
infl uence how mental health care is accessed and why.]{.underline}
Thus, coping strategies involving cheap and freely available
pharmaceuticals, alcohol and/or drugs develop in society (Inhorn and
Kobeissi 2006 ). More research is needed to explore the longterm mental
health impact of conflict.

Reproductive/Demographic [[Lives are disrupted during a confl
ict]{.mark}, as families, gender relations and patterns of reproduction
undergo profound changes.]{.underline} M[arriage is a means of societal
integration for disabled people but when most men are fi ghting or
community ties are disrupted, there may be earlier, delayed or no
marriages taking place. [Periods of confl ict also have reproductive
consequences for disabled women and men with lack of access to
reproductive services, antenatal, postnatal and emergency]{.mark}
care]{.underline}. There may also be an increase in perceived need for
certain services or technologies to prevent impairment, such as
antenatal screening in Vietnam (Gammeltoft 2013 ). Correlations exist
between lack of access to reproductive services (e.g. screening and
contraception) and war-time sexual violence, increases in Sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) , infertility, infant deaths and children
born with impairments. Disabled people often face discrimination in
services and institutions ensuring neglect, segregation, sterilisation
or institutionalisation. For example, Human Rights Watch ( 2010 )
documented high rates of physical and sexual abuse of disabled women
post-confl ict, but a lack of access to reproductive services, health
education and STI testing continues. Lack of access to reproductive
services pre- and post-confl ict is important to understand
demographically.

Social Structural [The [social structure of society changes during a
confl ict]{.mark} and the informal CBR systems that families and
communities are supplied with may collapse. [Programmes implemented by
NGOs that superfi cially mainstream disability may also **increase
poverty and marginalisation of disabled people**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see Wehbi 2011a ). [There could be [rising violence on account of
(small) arms and the circulation of drugs]{.mark}, often with links to
criminal networks and gangs, which leads to rises in specifi c types of
impairment (e.g. spinal cord injuries caused by bullet
wounds)]{.underline} (Buchanan 2011 ; Handicap International \[HI\] 2012
). [Confl ict and post-confl ict societal upheaval may last for decades
with the threat of bombs, drones and violence profoundly affecting
communities.]{.underline} Hill and Hansen ( 2011 ) describe how in
[Northern Ireland, a state of terror with bombs going off meant that
those with mobility problems were forced to stay at home, leading to
greater social isolation. Social isolation has also been identifi ed as
a risk factor when it comes to exploitation of disabled
people]{.underline} (Grove et al. 2010 ). The consequences of societal
breakdown, lack of evaluation of disability programming during a confl
ict and post-confl ict, and the programmes that empower disabled people
to survive must be urgently addressed.

[[Infrastructural Confl ict destroys most of the limited infrastructure
that exists for disabled people.]{.mark} Vocational workshops,
institutions such as day centres, and schools need to be
rebuilt.]{.underline} [Post-confl ict rebuilding can offer an
opportunity for inclusive design and mainstreaming of disability in all
infrastructural development.]{.underline} For instance, while education
is disrupted, new opportunities present themselves to rebuild
educational and vocational systems through inclusive practices (Miles
2013 ). Such interventions will have little impact, however, if issues
in the current educational system, notably that teachers lack training
and know-how and are often unpaid, are neglected. Likewise, ensuring
suitable skills training, micro-credit programmes, and employment in the
formal and informal economy are particular concerns post-confl ict, but
there will be gross diffi - culties in improving disabled people's
situation if societal attitudes remain negative, barriers persist in
transportation systems, or there is no economy to contribute to.
Therefore, we need to understand more about what enables the entire
social and physical infrastructure to become inclusive and robust
post-confl ict.

Environmental The [exploitation of resources and environmental impact of
confl icts will be felt for generations. Yet, the impact of new forms of
impairment on indigenous communities and women is rarely investigated
(Ngo et al. 2012 ). Likewise, disability rights and intergenerational
rights in terms of creation of differing forms of impairment are rarely
advocated (Soldatic 2013 ). No]{.underline}rth--South hierarchies in
bodies and body parts are thus still correlated with inequalities,
especially in countries with histories of violence or confl ict that are
undergoing political transitions (see Scheper-Hughes 1996 ). T[his is
exemplifi ed in [biopolitical claims for genetic reproductive harm, such
as the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, nuclear testing in the southern
hemisphere and the use of depleted uranium in Iraq]{.mark}, which are
rarely upheld. Refl ections on newer forms of biosociality, or social
identities based on biological, genetic or medical conditions (such as
HIV/AIDs), chemical and environmental harm, and the links between confl
ict, violence and activism remain unexplored.]{.underline}

Critical disability studies and justice

The influence of CDS and its challenge to the assumption that disability
is a uniform condition have enabled the emergence of new ideas on
disability. In particular, this has enabled the development of a theory
that can take account of not only impairment effects but also can
include class, ethnicity, sexual orientation or cultural identities. It
has also argued for the re-emergence of a new political identity, one
where a solidarity that was previously built on a common single identity
is replaced by one that incorporates multiple voices including
representatives from across the range of constituencies. The politics
that it seeks to develop will be the ending of the single interest group
identity of the disability movement to be replaced by single-issue
groups campaigning for different social issues. To paraphrase Lister
(1998, 74), [[if disability and impairment are simply]{.mark} to be
'[deconstructed]{.mark} into a kaleidoscope of shifting identities' and
ableist discourses, **[there will be no disabled people left to]{.mark}
either [fight for the right to be]{.mark}, or to be [a
citizen.]{.mark}**]{.underline} If the principles of CDS are evaluated
critically in the light of disadvantage, its analytical and political
value becomes questionable. Its relativism and its suggestions that
impairments are ethically and politically merely neutral differences are
false. [Impairments often have very tangible effects on people's
well-being]{.underline}, many of [which cannot be explained away by
deconstruction]{.underline} (for example, Shakespeare 2006; Thomas
1999). [[Recognizing impairment]{.mark} effects [is necessary]{.mark} in
order [to secure proper treatment and social arrangements]{.mark} that
enhance disabled people's well-being and social participation. CDS runs
the risk of dismissing]{.underline} not only the personal experiences of
living with impairment, but also [the significance of the differences
between socially created disadvantages.]{.underline} These
[[disadvantages]{.underline}]{.mark} that [often [result from
oppressive]{.mark} [social arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline}, are very
much real and take place in different ways for different disadvantaged
groups. [[Disabled people]{.mark} typically [experience disadvantage in
relation to the market]{.mark} and capitalism]{.underline}, and [[they
have to]{.mark} a large extent [been excluded]{.mark} [from
employment]{.mark} and from equal social participation]{.underline},
respect and wealth (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007, 26). On top of these
materialist disadvantages, disabled people are stigmatized as deviant
and undesirable, and also subordinated to various oppressive
hierarchical relations. [For [disabled people]{.mark} to achieve
participatory parity, they require more than recognition; **[they need
material help]{.mark}, targeted resource enhancement, and personal
enhancement**]{.underline} (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007). [Disability is
rooted in the economic structures of society and demands redistribution
of goods and wealth.]{.underline} In contrast to some other oppressed
groups, disabled people require more than the removal of barriers if
they are to achieve social justice. This extra help might be small --
for example, allowing a student with dyslexia extra time in an
examination -- through to complex interventions such as facilitated
communication, a job support worker or 24-hour personal assistance.
Whatever the size, it is an extra cost both to employers and to the
state. These are real needs and represent real differences. Without an
acceptance of these differences it is hard to see how we could move
forward. Whilst these 'real differences' can be presented as the result
of dominant ableist discourses where disabled people's needs are
regarded as extra cost, this does not solve the problem. [The problems
[disabled people]{.mark} face [require **more than ideological
change**]{.mark}, and ideological change is of little use if it does not
result in material change. [CDS **fails to account for the economic
basis of disability**]{.mark} and offers only the tools of
deconstruction and the abolishment of cultural hierarchies to eradicate
economic injustice. This]{.underline}, as Fraser (2000) has argued,
[would be possible in a society where there were no relatively
autonomous markets and the distribution of goods were regulated through
cultural values.]{.underline} In such a society, oppression based on
identity would translate perfectly into economic injustice and
maldistribution. [This is far from the current reality where
'marketization has pervaded all societies to some degree]{.underline},
at least partially decoupling economic mechanisms of distribution from
cultural patterns of value and prestige' (Fraser 2000, 111). Markets are
not controlled by nor are they subsidiary to culture; 'as a result they
generate economic inequalities that are not mere expressions of identity
hierarchies' (Fraser 2000, 111--112). The disadvantage related to
disability is to a great extent a matter of economic injustice, and
[before this injustice can be corrected we have to be able to identify
those individuals and social groups that have been disadvantaged by
social arrangements. Whilst this does create and foster categories and
binaries between groups of people, it also requires some sort of
categories to start with; namely, the various categories of
disadvantage.]{.underline} Both the social and physical mechanisms that
produce human diversity are real, and they produce tangible differences
that cannot be challenged, let alone abolished, merely by pointing out
the wanton nature of difference, and deconstructing the meanings
attached to disability. Changing the social conditions that disadvantage
and disable some people demands that the diverse, sometimes dualistic,
reality of social advantage and disadvantage between different groups of
people is recognized. This is exactly why group identities based on, for
example, impairment, gender, or sexuality have been invaluable tools in
the resistance against discrimination and oppression -- in the fight
against socially produced disadvantage. [[Confident]{.mark}, positive
[disability identity has enabled]{.mark} many disabled [people
to]{.mark} actively challenge the status quo that disadvantages them and
to [claim rights and]{.mark} power and [participation in]{.mark}
dominant [institutions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Being different from the
so-called normal majority is no longer considered to conflict with a
good life, equality and respect. Quite the opposite, [positive
realization of one's difference has been liberating and empowering to
many disabled people]{.underline} (Shakespeare 2006; Morris 1991). For a
radical and active disability movement to emerge and for disabled people
to take action on their own account, they have to see themselves as an
unfairly marginalized or disadvantaged constituency and a minority group
(Shakespeare and Watson 2001). [[The category disabled/ non-disabled is
a good abstraction that can **enable**]{.mark} **the development of
[communities of resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and without it is
hard to see how these could develop. CDS is premised on the idea that
difference acts as a precursor to the normalizing of behaviour and a
requirement to treat people differently and, importantly, less
favourably. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that the
categories that are applied to disabled people create an unnecessary
divide between disabled and nondisabled people. You could equally make
the point that [[without]{.mark} these [categories we would not
know]{.mark} what it is we have to do, [what actions]{.mark} we have to
take [or what services]{.mark} we have to put in place to include
disabled people.]{.underline} Indeed, [for many disabled people the
disadvantages they are subjected to arise not as the result of
domination but through neglect and the denial of services and through
society failing to take responsibility for those in need.]{.underline}
As Wolff (2009, 114) points out: 'anti-discrimination policy needs to
identify a group to be protected.' In other words, [it is impossible to
fight the oppression of a group of people that does not
exist.]{.underline} Recognition of impairment is also crucial regarding
legislation and policy that aim to protect disabled people against
discrimination. [The point of anti-discrimination legislation is to
protect people from discrimination on the basis of their physical and
mental properties, not on their opportunity to achieve equal
participation and respect.]{.underline} Thus, 'the parallel to race and
gender is not disability but impairment' (Wolff 2009, 135).

Further, [[deconstructing differences will not]{.mark} in and of itself
[produce respect and equality between all people with various
characteristics. Neither will it result in a social order free from a
sense of difference.]{.mark} It is simply unrealistic to assume that a
society could exist were people would not see some other people as
different]{.underline}, and their lives or characteristics as
representing a deviation from some norm considered important regarding
good human life. This is because [[some]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
[[individual characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark} that define disabled
people [[are, sometimes]{.underline}]{.mark} with good reason,
[[undesirable, even in a utopia]{.mark} where all differences would have
been queered.]{.underline} [**[Disability is not the same]{.mark}**
as]{.underline} many [other group identities]{.underline} and we need to
explore both morally and socially disability and difference rather than
simply use difference as a concept through which to critique the
disability identity. [There are no rational reasons to consider
homosexuality or gender undesirable characteristics whatever the social
context,]{.underline} but there are many impairments that can reasonably
be seen as undesirable (Shakespeare 2006). [[Motor neuron disease,
depression or spinal cord injury are]{.underline}]{.mark} the kinds of
[[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we would prefer not to]{.mark}
have, and this is not merely because of the cultural representations
attached to them but because **[these conditions]{.mark} are the kinds
of predicaments that [cause suffering irrespective of one's cultural
environment.]{.mark}** In [acknowledging]{.mark} that
[impairments]{.mark} can include an undesirable dimension **[does not
imply devaluing people with impairments]{.mark}** nor their positive
group identity]{.underline} (Shakespeare and Watson 2010). As long as
people are genuinely free to decide for themselves and feel about
themselves however they wish to feel, we are pretty close to relational
justice, free from hierarchical evils. [Imposing on people ableist or
disablist assumptions is certainly wrong, but so would be the denial of
the personal experiences]{.underline} of fearing the loss of one's
physical and mental capacities, or the fear of dying (Carel 2008). [To
explain the psychological anguish related to conditions such as motor
neurone disease or depression merely in terms of internalized oppression
and ableism would be insensitive]{.underline}, disrespectful and simply
nonsensical.
