This dissertation argues that **[the notion of human dignity
is]{.underline}** in fact **[a subtle discursive tool in the service of
abusive power structures]{.underline}**. [The notion of human dignity is
more a function of sovereign power than a deep and abiding concept in
the service of human rights]{.underline}. **[Human dignity is vital to a
state-compromised liberal discourse]{.underline}** [of individual
autonomy and identity to the same extent that the value of cultural and
hierarchical]{.underline} ―dignity has long been central to the more
forthrightly **[abusive language of national identity and social
class]{.underline}**. Egalitarian human dignity is [a mere variation on
the same concept that has been variously but consistently defined by
power]{.underline}, be it the dignity that means rank and distinction or
the monotheistic dignity of the human's privileged but tormented
relation to her Creator. The dissertation explores the philosophical and
ethical paradoxes of a supposedly inherent human dignity that not only
still needs to be proactively realized by the individual but has also to
be recognized, guaranteed and protected by society. While I recognize
the aspirations and the occasional effectiveness of the wellintentioned
use of ―human dignity as a rhetorical tool to help disadvantaged
populations, [I seek to expose the underlying complicity between the
notion of human dignity and a stifling power structure.]{.underline}

In order to capture several of the ideals that have been directly and
indirectly linked to, and advanced under the rubric of, human dignity
after the concept was first introduced by Immanuel Kant, I survey
several fields including: human rights; ethics; moral philosophy;
political science; psychology; literature and literary criticism. A
general list of such dignity based ideals includes: intrinsic human
worth; personal autonomy; acting in freedom from or against animal
instinct; recognition of and respect for the other and demanding the
same in return; self-assertion; demotion of personal interest in favor
of responsibility, altruism and sacrifice; political consciousness,
action and inclusion in a political community; claiming an identity; the
need for creativity, originality, and authenticity. [Based on this
accumulative meaning, I argue that human dignity, in all its
formulations, is a discourse that misrepresents the meaning of
empowerment for modern citizens as they become interested more in
political gestures and less in material profit]{.underline}. Running
through most of the dissertation is a continuing effort to correct
Giorgio Agamben's response to Michel Foucault's question about how [the
modern state endows its citizen with a political subjectivity and
individuality and, by the same gesture, subjects him to a totalized
system]{.underline}. I argue **[that it is the discourse of human
dignity that makes possible a superficially individuated, but subtly and
ultimately totalized, culture]{.underline}**. This project also
demonstrates, sometimes in a counter-intuitive way, how some of **[the
ideals within the discourse of human dignity have worked in accord with
nationalist, racist and other dangerous world views.]{.underline}**

#### Turns Case -- dignity based human rights only necessitates erasure of life outside the political and enables violent structures of state power.

Moreover, [**a dignity-based human rights agenda is particularly
counter-productive** in negotiating and theorizing the condition of the
stateless, the refugees, and other transient populations. Such an
approach is doomed because it cannot escape a certain foundational
philosophy of the political life]{.underline}. Intertwined, as we have
seen, with the necessity of membership in a political community, [human
dignity is antithetical to the prospect of a post-national world and a
post-normative ethics]{.underline}. Hannah Arendt's argument that
―[human rights can again be meaningful only if they are redefined as a
right to the human condition itself, which depends upon some belonging
to some human community, the right never to be dependent upon some
inborn human dignity]{.underline} which de facto, aside from its
guarantee by fellow men, . . . does not exist‖ (Origins 439) replaces
one problem with another. Human dignity is still the telos of politics
in this formulation. Human dignity might not be inborn, for Arendt, but
the guarantee of such dignity is the goal of political and collective
action: human dignity depends on the work of a political community.
[**The problem with this premise is that making human dignity the end of
human rights necessitates an erasure of life outside the political,** an
abnegation of mere ―givenness.]{.underline}

Arendt's rejection of human dignity as the basis of rights while
positing this ideal as the consummation of rights becomes a source of
confusion. Seyla Benhabib, explaining Arendt, speaks of a core of
dignity that simultaneously precedes and coincides with man's right to
have rights. According to Benhabib, history has shown that [the
politically empowered usually do not protect the politically
disempowered;]{.underline} therefore, [the disempowered should first be
recognized as having the moral right to have political
rights]{.underline}. Arendt is interested in cultivating this first
right, and it is this right she associates with human dignity; even when
a person loses ―all the so-called Rights of Man, he should not lose ―his
essential quality as man, his human dignity (Benhabib 57). [The right to
have rights is a ―moral claim to membership and a certain form of
treatment compatible with the claim to membership]{.underline} (Benhabib
56). As we can see, whether it is as the origin of rights or the end of
rights, **[human dignity encloses the human in the discourse of
power]{.underline}**, which privileges the concept of community. It is a
normative [ethics that cannot see the human as free from the bonds of
community. Even when it is idealized as the equal representation of
ideas by equal members, community politics will derive meaning
exclusively from deep structures that mask privilege and
hierarchy]{.underline}. Not only does **[human dignity]{.underline}**
derive from membership in the public discourse of a political community,
but it **[contributes to such discourse, which ultimately binds the
human to the mental constructs of power.]{.underline}**

Even though Arendt adopts an anti-foundational approach to human
dignity, her insistence on collective political discourse that
ultimately leads to human dignity cannot escape the normative ethics of
a dignity inscribed in group membership. Disappointingly, instead of
looking forward to a new ethics divorced completely from the notion of
human dignity, Arendt elects to play by the terms of sovereign power. As
we have seen Serena Parekh put it, ―Arendt wants people to have the
possibility of transforming themselves from mere givenness (zoē) into
individuals with unique identities (bios); that transformation is only
possible through acting and speaking with others in a public space‖
(39). Turning the transient into a politically involved citizen is an
instance of the intersection between individuation and totalization.

To be sure, Arendt's emphasizes worldliness and political consciousness
and action as antidotes to evidently problematic modes of thinking such
as racial and cultural allegiances--- part of being worldly is to claim
citizenship of the world at large. A freedom-aspiring person, according
to Arendt, attains her goal through singular action rather than
associative sameness within a group. Arendt, following Bernard Lazare,
refers to this person as the ―conscious pariah, one who refuses to
assimilate and who always separates and rebels (Origins 67). Political
action and rebellion, however, often descend into totalitarian and
ideological group identity, as Arendt herself notes with regard to
Zionism. For Arendt, Zionism started as a political idea that went awry
when it sought a model in the western nation-state. Human dignity as
group membership in a community is detectable in the notion of welcoming
or hospitality. The terms are now being used in addressing transient
issues, especially with regard to the mass movement of populations with
the expansion of the European Union.

[The discourse of dignity is also manifest in the concept of welcoming;
to welcome somebody is to dignify her]{.underline}. But from Derrida's
perspective, [we only welcome those who are already conversant in the
discourse of dignity]{.underline}. In his and Dufourmantelle's Of
Hospitality (2000), a meditation on migrants and refugees, Derrida sums
up the problem and contradiction in the discourse of hospitality in the
inevitable fact that the right to hospitality is not extended to an
individual, for this morality is ―inscribed in a custom, an ethos, and a
sittlichkeit‖ (23). [Just like the right to hospitality, dignity
is]{.underline} inscribed in a sittlichkeit (an ethical life). In other
words, it is [attached to an established form of life such as family
life, civil society or the state]{.underline}. It is extended by a
family to a family; the foreigner receiving the hospitality is never
without a ―proper name or a family (23). For Derrida, the ―foreigner we
welcome is never the barbarian, the absolute other. The foreigner we
welcome is expected to know the rules of hospitality, and that's why she
receives it. [By the time she receives the hospitality, the foreigner is
already drawn into the discourse of the state.]{.underline} Therefore,
[because dignity is now lodged in a custom, it does not serve the
purpose of addressing the real foreigner, who does not have a proper
name or a family or a state.]{.underline} In the terms of hospitality,
offshoots of the discourse of dignity, the host's offer implies an
acknowledging by the guest. There is no place for the untranslatable zoē
in the common discourse that brings them together. [Dignity here is also
based on an identifiable place of origin and a fixed place of arrival.
In the discourse of dignity, the foreigner ceases to be foreign the
moment he receives the hospitality.]{.underline} [The discourse of human
dignity is a major barrier on the way to unconditioned hospitality, if
the latter is ever possible.]{.underline}

#### The notion of dignity is a form of state virtue representation that enables the survival of the state and shields the sovereign from the repercussions of enacting political violence.

On the other hand, [dignity---acquired through an image of popular
revolt and violence--- becomes the very means of preserving the power
status quo and forestalling innovation and change.]{.underline} Walter
Benjamin's distinction between ―constituting‖ power and ―constituted‖
power is helpful here. [Benjamin]{.underline}, according to Agamben,
―[presented the relation between constituting power and constituted
power as the relation between the violence that posits law and the
violence that preserves it]{.underline}‖ (Homo 40). Both forms of
violence are part of a circular schema: law-positing violence
(revolutionary, radical violence) becomes part of the law-preserving
violence (the lawenforcing state). Agamben notes: ―[If constituting
power is, as the violence that posits law, certainly more noble than the
violence that preserves it, constituting power still possesses no title
that might legitimate something other than the law-preserving violence
and even maintains an ambiguous and ineradicable relationship with
constituted power]{.underline}‖ (Homo 40). Benjamin sees this hopeless
circularity reflected in the work of representative bodies:

[If the awareness of the latent presence of violence in a legal
institution disappears, the juridical institution decays.]{.underline}
An example of this is provided today by the parliaments. They present
such a well-known, sad spectacle because they have not remained aware of
the revolutionary forces to which they owe their existence . . . They
lack a sense of the creative violence of law that is represented in
them. One need not then be surprised that they do not arrive at
decisions worthy of this violence, but instead oversee a course of
political affairs that avoids violence through compromise. (qtd. in
Agamben, Homo 28)

Benjamin laments the fact that [legal institutions never remain faithful
to their]{.underline} violent, [democratic roots]{.underline}.

My argument, however, goes a step further; [it is only to the extent
that such institutions of sovereign power represent themselves
constantly as attuned to their revolutionary beginnings that they hold
on to the dignity that in turn guarantees their survival.]{.underline}
Agamben's characterization of revolutionary violence as ―certainly more
noble than the violence that preserves‖ the existing law betrays the
role I see dignity playing in this paradoxical relation between the two
forms of law. The ―noble‖ badge gives the creative violence immunity and
turns it into an untouchable violence. Article Three of the Declaration
of the Rights of Man and the Citizen states that ―[sovereignty resides
essentially in the Nation. No body nor individual may exercise any
authority which does not proceed directly from the nation.]{.underline}‖
Article Twelve states that ―security of the rights of man and of the
citizen requires public military forces. [These forces are]{.underline},
therefore, [established for the good of all and not for the personal
advantage of those to whom they shall be intrusted.]{.underline}‖ [The
popular force that bestows mystique on this declaration then places
force exclusively in sovereign power. The dignity of violence in a
back-handed way shields sovereignty from potential
violence.]{.underline}
