# Cybernetics K Supplement---Wave 1---FMPS

### Notes

Thanks to Ansel Ang-Olson, Arthur Guo, Cleo Shaw, Esther Liu, George
Jabren, and Rajan Sandhu for doing fantastic work!

This file is intended to supplement the starter packet cybernetics K and
includes very few of the cards from that file. Here's a brief rundown of
how this file is organized:

**Topshelf:** New links and impacts, different potential alternatives,
new framework angles/pieces of offense

**Blocks:** Supplements to the blocks from the original file; if a block
has the same name as one from the original file, then the cards in it
are simply alternatives, not necessarily replacements

**Answers:** More answers; largely organized in the aff context, but
(like the aff section of the original file) also useful for neg cards
against cybernetics affs, like the one in this file

**Bronze Night Aff:** A cybernetics aff! See the notes section there for
more. There is not a separate neg section; a framework file is being
released separately, and there are plenty of substantive answers to the
aff between the answers section in this file and the starter packet
file. Additionally, more material that can be used on the neg against
this aff (and other K affs) will be coming from our lab in wave 2!

The use of "automaton" in reference to man can be traced to the work of
William [Cornwallis]{.underline}: in his Essayes of Certaine Paradoxes
(1616), he [compares human performance to the functioning of man-made
mechanisms]{.underline}. "In the whole course and frame of Nature, we
see that nothing is made for it selfe," he writes and explains[, "the
sunne by his splendor to lighten all the world; by his warmth and heate,
to cherish and comfort each livuing and vegetable thing]{.underline}"
(G2). [In such an interconnected universe of things, Cornwallis
conceives the body as both attached to its surroundings and, at the same
time, an autonomous system]{.underline}, [an assemblage of interrelated
parts linked by the invisible "bond of duty, of use or of service, by
which it is indebted to other]{.underline}": the foot to the eye, the
hand to the foot, the mouth to the hand, the stomach to the mouth, the
whole body to the stomach; the human beings to their dogs and to their
oxen (G2-G3). "[Let \[~~man~~\] but looke into himself]{.underline},"
Cornwallis wrote, "[and see how his constitutiue parts are debters each
to other, the soule doth quicken and giue life to the body, the body
like an Automaton, doth moue and carry it selfe and the
soule]{.underline}" (G3). Cornwallis' depiction of [the mechanism of the
body as an automaton does not presume]{.underline}, however, that its
attachment to the environment makes it what we call today [an open
system]{.underline}. Rather[, it remains a system closed-on-itself, that
functions independently of will, man's conscious control, or any outside
direction]{.underline}. In the French context, a similar intuition was
expressed by [Pascal]{.underline}, who [used]{.underline} "[automate"
for "man that acts as a machine]{.underline}" in his posthumously
published Thoughts in 1669. In this book, Pascal continued his earlier
exploration of the idea of **[the natural order as "a homogeneous and
autonomous whole, governed by laws, agreeing with a certain model, which
derives its independence from one or more other orders]{.underline}**,"
which [he identifies in Thoughts as the order of the body, the order of
the mind or reason, and the order of the heart or of
charity]{.underline} (#308, #933).

[Is there any "attachment" or "connection" between an automaton and the
environment? This issue was articulated by the seventeenth-century
philosophers in terms or "agreement" or "correlation" between the
"orders]{.underline}." We can still say that, for Cornwallis, 71 [the
cause of automation was located both inside and outside the automated
living or nonliving entity]{.underline}, but [only in the sense that
**automation** **was seen as the effect of a higher law acting upon the
automated entity from the outside,** which was the same as the inner law
operating within an automated entity]{.underline}. [**Modern science's
response** to the questions raised about the relation between these
orders or **systems is to "mathematicalize**]{.underline}" (Milner) [the
correspondence]{.underline}. The process that Lacan and, later,
Jacques-Alain Miller identify as ["suturing," emerges as a mathematical
technique for demonstrating the presence of determinism or, as Lacan
speaks about it, a law without intention]{.underline} (Seminar II 295),
[that was supposed to ground man's relation to the "new" world system of
correlated, autonomous, and automated orders]{.underline}. [The subject
of science emerges]{.underline} not in the rupture between these
automated inner and outer universes, but as this rupture, which, as
Slavoj Žižek has noted, "involves no lived experience, consciousness, or
any other predicates we usually associate with subjectivity" (597).

Let us consider Jean-Claude Milner's summary of one of Alexandre Koyré's
theorems of modern science found at the basis of Lacan's theory of
science: [M**odern science holds that there is no boundary limiting its
material domain**]{.underline}. [It supposes two things: (**a) there
exists nothing material that modern science cannot treat as one of its
objects** (in other words, the set of existent material objects, usually
called a universe, is in principle coextensive with the set of objects
of modern science); (b) **both sets are mathematically infinite** (hence
the notion of the modern infinite universe as opposed to the closed
world of Antiquity). ("Lacan and the Ideal of Science]{.underline}" 29)
[In other words, he argues that "**a particular expression, a particular
thought are modern only insofar as they belong to a system of thought in
which a mathematized empirical science is possible**]{.underline}"
(Milner, "Lacan and the Ideal of Science" 29). [This allows modern
science to challenge the Euclidian conception of "space" and to
articulate a theory of "place," or analysis situs, to use the archaic
name for topology, which began in the work of Leibniz]{.underline}.
Before Leibniz, the question of space was approached by René Descartes,
who already thought of it only in connection to the extended body, res
extensa, or "corporeal substance," one of the three substances of
Cartesian ontology. [According to Descartes, matter extends in length,
breadth, or depth and it is precisely this property of matter that
constitutes space: space only exists as a consequence of such
extension]{.underline}. In his correspondence with English philosopher
Henry More48 from the 1640s, Descartes agreed with him that "in the
natural course of events there is no vacuum," but he also noted that
there was what could not be perceived, and reserved the full knowledge
of the invisible part of the extended body for God. Despite his
awareness of the divisibility of matter, Descartes posited the extended
body as existing beyond the perception of man: "[a body can retain its
whole bodily nature without being soft or hard or cold or hot to the
senses -- indeed without having any perceptible quality]{.underline},"
he wrote; "**[all matter is completely imperceptible if it is divided
into parts much smaller than the particles of our nerves and the
individual parts are given a sufficiently rapid
movement]{.underline},**" which, he noted further in the letter to More,
"is in a manner circular" (Descartes, III 360, 363). [Descartes' theory
of automation, however, was different from his conception of the
machinic body]{.underline} [When Descartes approached this topic in the
1640s, he offered a mechanistic conception of the body49 that, he
believed, physiologically functioned in the same way for both Homo
sapiens and animals, except that the latter were lacking in "thinking
substance]{.underline}." He conceived the movements of animals as
"purely mechanical and corporeal," depending "solely on the force of the
spirits and the structure of ... organs" that "can be called the
corporeal soul" (III 365).50 For Descartes, animals were thus "natural
automata": ...it is certain that in the bodies of animals, as in ours,
there are bones, nerves, muscles, animal spirits and other organs so
arranged that they can by themselves, without any thought, give rise to
all the movements we observe in animals. This is very clear in
convulsions, when the mechanism of the body moves despite the mind, and
often moves more violently and in a more varied manner than usually
happens when it is moved by the will. (Descartes, III 366) Even though
human bodies could, when they were not guided by thought or their
"incorporeal soul," exhibit such behaviour, men were not automata, but
machines or mechanisms. When he said, "God made our body like a machine,
and he wanted it to function like a universal instrument, which would
always operate in the same way in accordance with its own laws"
(Descartes, V 163-164), he was not referring to human automatism, but
the machinic organization of the body. As Dennis Des Chene has argued in
Spirits and Clocks, the novelty of Descartes' theory was in combining
...[the animal-machine with a new philosophy of nature, in which the
actions of agents inferior to humans not only might but must be
explained without reference to any "form" but extension or to any
qualities but the modes of extension.]{.underline} Descartes had the
formidable task of showing that the vegetative and sensitive powers of
plants and animals are nothing other than the actions they exhibit by
virtue of the "disposition" of their parts. (13) Thus, automata, for
Descartes, were self-contained machines, closed systems; and as such,
they could not be human. The openness and connectedness of the
human-machine to the world was maintained by means of the non-physical
res cogitans, the mental substance. By denying automata the capacity for
mental functioning, he made a distinction between automation of the
self-moving life or non-life forms and intelligence, an attitude which
would dominate until the mid-to-late nineteenth century. At the same
time, as Lorraine Daston reminds us, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
usage of the term "intelligence" ...overlaps but does not coincide with
its twentieth-century meaning. Both denote mental agility, particularly
in problem solving and learning; but whether intelligence was inborn or
acquired by education, unitary or multiple in its faculties, the
property of individuals or of groups, these were oppositions which would
not have been easily accommodated within the Enlightenment framework for
understanding the mind. (191) [Therefore, calculating machines, for
example, would not qualify as "intelligent]{.underline}." [On the
contrary, due to their automatic, or algorithmic, behavior, they were
seen as the opposite of anything intelligent]{.underline}. [The
fascination with automata over the course of the eighteenth century and
the beginning of the nineteenth was the fascination with the
"non-intelligent" behaviour of "dummies," especially when these
human-like and other automata demonstrated their sometimes uncanny
proximity to human performance]{.underline}.

#### A "bloodless" war between machines is impossible -- the technological nature of LAWS guarantees alternatives that target non-military objectives

2.1. Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems and AI in Warfare Debate relating
to Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) is a mile wide but an inch
deep - vast but as-yet unsubstantiated. Ample discussion surrounds the
potential political, legal and moral repercussions of deploying LAWS but
there is little theoretically-informed analysis of their development.
Given the revolutionary potential of such technologies, there is an
urgent need to rectify this imbalance. Political challenges posed by the
deployment of LAWS on battlefields are numerous. [Unlike nuclear
weapons, LAWS would require no hard-to-obtain materials and be
relatively cheap to develop, leading some to fear a global robot arms
race. Even those contending that "arms race" framing risks escalating
rivalries nevertheless agree on the need to manage the proliferation of
these technologies. In particular, the risk of LAWS proliferating among
non-state actors seeking to "level the playing field" is severe. Even
among democratic states, LAWS would overcome the "bodybag" problem and
thus lower the threshold for going to war. In such a scenario, however,
the obvious attraction of using LAWS - a 'bloodless' war between
machines - is misguided. A change of footsoldiers does not alter the
fundamental objective of war: "imposing and enduring costs to reveal
relative capability or resolve." In the absence of human soldiers to
impose costs upon, belligerents may seek alternative means to
demonstrate their resolve, e.g. by targeting non-military objectives and
civilians. Indeed, as drones have enabled the removal of soldiers from
battlefields, the inability for enemies to directly reciprocate violence
has instigated fears of "blowback" by other means.]{.underline}
Political concerns aside, the legal questions raised by LAWS are
momentous. Formal and informal rules have guided conduct in warfare for
as long as it has been carried out. Over time, International
Humanitarian Law (IHL) has steadily evolved to keep up with the
development of new methods of warfighting, as evidenced by bans on the
use of Chemical and Biological Weapons, anti-personnel landmines and
blinding laser weapons. Throughout history, however, [IHL has been
developed under the assumption that human intelligence is guiding
conduct in combat, not artificial. As existing treaties make no
reference to LAWS, it is unclear if they can be banned under the current
legal framework.]{.underline} Nevertheless, because it is impossible to
confidently predict the outcomes of commands on complex AI systems,
[there is a possibility of LAWS running afoul of IHL. Can a robot be
entrusted with the ability to discriminate between legitimate targets
and civilians? If it fails, who can be held accountable? Some fear LAWS
subverting the Hague Convention if they can act autonomously but not
assume responsibility for the consequences.]{.underline} The ethics of
using LAWS are fraught. At first glance, there is obvious appeal in
using robots to do the "dull, dirty and dangerous" work in war as in
civilian life. A robot never gets tired, stressed or traumatised. Their
dispassionate nature, immune to the intoxicating effects of adrenaline,
may even reduce the risk of civilian harm in conflict. From this
perspective, if LAWS lessens the danger to soldiers and civilians alike,
some suggest utilising them is not only judicious but an ethical
imperative. [Even if LAWs could perfectly adhere to IHL and reduce harm
to both combatants and civilians, many question whether they should. As
a simple matter of dignity, some insist that taking a human life should
involve a human decision. "Delegating the decision to kill to
algorithms," according to Rosert and Sauer, "is inhumane and
unacceptable under any circumstances."]{.underline} A compelling
argument, but potentially relativised by the fact that there are many
different interpretations of human dignity and many ways it can be
violated - technological or otherwise. The political, ethical and legal
concerns raised are troubling but overwhelmingly speculative. Are we
jumping the (autonomous) gun? Such preoccupation with the future use of
killer robots may obscure meaningful debate about their present day
development. A few notable contributions from Lewis, Taylor and
Verbruggen are to be commended for grappling with the development of
these systems, but this remains an under-theorised field. Presumably
owing to its novelty, Project Maven has thus far evaded serious academic
scrutiny. One notable exception comes from Suchman, however it
nevertheless engages primarily with the deployment rather than
development of this technology. Common to these conjectural, dystopian
perspectives on the future of warfare is the assumption that if LAWS
technology exists, it will be used. Not a dramatic leap of faith but
nevertheless [it seems prudent to question what is driving the demand
for these technologies in this domain; thereby drawing the line between
where we stand and where some fear we are heading.]{.underline} LAWS
will only be deployed, presumably, if there is some strategic,
operational and/or tactical need for them. Understanding this will
elucidate a fuller picture of why and how they are being developed. To
satisfy this curiosity, we turn to the growing field of scholarship on
remote warfare.

### Link---AI---Ethics

#### The aff's search for ethics ignores the way algorithms inevitably shape our assumptions and forward technological manipulation 

**Amoore 20** (Louise Amoore, Professor of Political Geography at Durham
University, "Cloud Ethics: Algorithms and the Attributes of Ourselves
and Others", *Duke University Press*, 8/30/20,

Ethics of Algorithms At first sight, the potential for violent harm
precipitated by algorithms that learn to recognize human propensities
appears to be a self-evident matter for critique. [Surely, one could
say, the ethical terrain of the algorithm resides in the broader
political landscape of rights and wrongs, good and evil. After all, one
could readily identify a set of rights, already apparently registered as
belonging to rights-bearing subjects, that has been contravened by
algorithms that generate targets, adjudicating which people may
peaceably assemble, or which people are worthy of credit or employment,
and on what terms.]{.underline} Indeed, on this terrain of delineating
the rights and wrongs of algorithmic actions is precisely where many
critical voices on the harms of the algorithm have been heard. Writing
in the New York Times, for example, Kate Crawford identifies machine
learning's "white guy problem," arguing that "we need to be vigilant
about how we design and train machine learning systems."10 The dominant
critical perspectives on algorithmic decisions have thus argued for
removing the "bias" or the "value judgements" of the algorithm, and for
regulating harmful and damaging mathematical models.11 Within each of
these critical calls, the ethical problem is thought to dwell in the
opacity of the algorithm and in its inscrutability, so that what Frank
Pasquale has called the "black box society" is addressed through
remedies of transparency and accountability.12 In sum, the rise of
algorithmic power in society has been overwhelmingly understood as a
problem of opaque and illegible algorithms infringing or undercutting a
precisely legible world of rights belonging to human subjects. [In such
a framing, there is an outside to the algorithm---an accountable human
subject who is the locus of responsibility, the source of a code of
conduct with which algorithms must comply. To call for the opening of
the black box, for transparency and accountability, then, is to seek to
institute arrangements that are good, ethical, and normal, and to
prevent the transgression of societal norms by the
algorithm]{.underline}. Yet, when people gathered to protest on
Baltimore streets, or when Facebook users' data fueled the political and
commercial models of Cambridge Analytica (figure I.3), legible rights to
peaceable assembly or to electoral due process were not violated
primarily by illegible algorithms. Rather, the means by which people
could appear in a political forum, the conditions of their appearance,
and the capacities they had to make a recognizable political claim in
the world were subject to algorithmic regimes of what Michel Foucault
calls truth telling and wrongdoing.13 [In short, what matters is not
primarily the identification and regulation of algorithmic wrongs, but
more significantly how algorithms are implicated in new regimes of
verification, new forms of identifying a wrong or of truth telling in
the world.]{.underline} [Understood in these terms, the algorithm
already presents itself as an ethicopolitical arrangement of values,
assumptions, and propositions about the world. One does not need to look
beyond the algorithm for an outside that is properly political and
recognizably of ethics]{.underline}. Indeed, there can be no legible
human outside the algorithm and underwriting its conduct, for as John
Cheney-Lippold reminds us, we are enmeshed in the data that produce each
"freshly minted algorithmic truth."14 [One cannot sustain a search for
codes of ethics that instill the good, the lawful, or the normal into
the algorithm. Contemporary algorithms are not so much transgressing
settled societal norms as establishing new patterns of good and bad, new
thresholds of normality and abnormality, against which actions are
calibrated.]{.underline} [Actions one might consider harmful, as William
Connolly notes, are not merely "actions by immoral agents who freely
transgress the moral law" but are "arbitrary cruelty installed in
regular institutional arrangements taken to embody the Law, the Good,
and the Normal."]{.underline}15 Amid the widespread search for new
ethical arrangements for the scrutiny and regulation of algorithms, what
becomes of the arbitrary harms lodged within embodied algorithmic
arrangements? [One could imagine a world in which the deep neural
networks used in cities like Baltimore are scrutinized and rendered
compliant with rules and yet continue to learn to recognize and
misrecognize people and to infer intent, to generate rules from the
contingent and arbitrary data of many past moments of associative life
on the city streets, to refine and edit the code for future uses in
unknown future places]{.underline}. I may feel that some notion of
legible rights is protected, and yet the attributes generated from my
data, in correlation with yours and others', continue to supply the
conditions for future arbitrary actions against unknown others. I draw a
distinction here between ethics as code, or what Michel Foucault
describes as "the code that determines which acts are permitted or
forbidden," and ethics as the inescapably political formation of the
relation of oneself to oneself and to others.16 [My argument is that
there is a need for a certain kind of ethical practice in relation to
algorithms, one that does not merely locate the permissions and
prohibitions of their use. This different kind of ethical practice
begins from the algorithm as always already an ethicopolitical entity by
virtue of being immanently formed through the relational attributes of
selves and others.]{.underline} My desire for a different mode of
critique and ethical account is animated not by the question, How ought
the algorithm be arranged for a good society?, but by the question, How
are algorithmic arrangements generating ideas of goodness,
transgression, and what society ought to be?

#### Algorithms can never be ethical -- attempts fail to account for the relations in which they first emerged

**Amoore 20** (Louise Amoore, Professor of Political Geography at Durham
University, "Cloud Ethics: Algorithms and the Attributes of Ourselves

[A cloud ethics acknowledges that algorithms contain, within their
spatial arrangements, multiple potentials for cruelties, surprises,
violences, joys, distillations of racism and prejudice, injustices,
probabilities, discrimination, and chance]{.underline}. Indeed, many of
the features that some would like to excise from the algorithm---bias,
assumptions, weights---are routes into opening up their politics.
Algorithms come to act in the world precisely in and through the
relations of selves to selves, and selves to others, as these relations
are manifest in the clusters and attributes of data. To learn from
relations of selves and others, the algorithm must already be replete
with values, thresholds, assumptions, probability weightings, and bias.
[In a real sense, an algorithm must necessarily discriminate to have any
traction in the world. The very essence of algorithms is that they
afford greater degrees of recognition and value to some features of a
scene than they do to others. In so doing, algorithms generate
themselves as ethicopolitical beings in the world]{.underline}. If to
have ethics is not merely to have a code prohibiting, for example, bias
or assumptions, but to work on oneself via relations, [then the
ethicopolitics of algorithms involves investigations of how they learn
to recognize and to act, how they extract assumptions from data
relations, and how they learn what ought to be from relations with other
humans and algorithms.]{.underline} To be clear, the cloud ethics I
propose here does not belong to an episteme of accountability,
transparency, and legibility, but on the contrary begins with the
opacity, partiality, and illegibility of all forms of giving an account,
human and algorithmic. To advance a cloud ethics is to engage the
ungrounded politics of all forms of ethical relations. The significant
new ethical challenges that algorithms seem to present to society
actually manifest novel features of some profoundly old problems of the
grounds for ethical action. [As Judith Butler explains in her Spinoza
lectures, the demand to give an account of oneself will always fall
short, for "I cannot give an account of myself without accounting for
the conditions under which I emerge]{.underline}."[19 If one assumes
that the determination of an unequivocal I who acts is a necessary
precondition of ethics, as Butler cautions, then this identifiable self
is "dispossessed" by the condition of its emergence in relation to
others.]{.underline} For Butler, this persistent failure to give a
clear-sighted account does not mark the limit point of ethics. On the
contrary, the opaque and unknowable nature of making all kinds of acting
subjects is the condition of possibility of having an ethicopolitical
life.20 In short, and in contrast to the equation of ethics with
transparency and disclosure, ethical responsibility is sustained by
conditions of partiality and opacity. My notion of a cloud ethics
extends the opacity of the human subject, envisaging a plurality of
venues for ethical responsibility in which all selves---human and
algorithmic---proceed from their illegibility. The apparent opacity and
illegibility of the algorithm should not pose an entirely new problem
for human ethics, for the difficulty of locating clear-sighted action
was already present. The I who forms the ethical relation was always in
question and is now, with algorithms, in question in new ways. Though
the mathematical propositions of algorithms cannot be made fully
legible, or rendered accountable, they can be called to give accounts of
the conditions of their emergence. These conditions include some
relations that are identifiably between humans and algorithms---such as
the selection and labeling of training data, the setting of target
outputs, or the editing of code "in the wild," for example---but others
still are relations of algorithms to another algorithm, such as a
classifier supplying the training data from which a neural network will
learn. In all such instances of iterative learning, the significant
point is that the conditions of an algorithm's emergence---a composite
of human-algorithm relations---are venues for ethicopolitics.

### Link---AI---Perception/Targeting

#### Algorithms' superior abilities of "perception" creates rash reactionary politics 

**Amoore 20** (Louise Amoore, Professor of Political Geography at Durham
University, "Cloud Ethics: Algorithms and the Attributes of Ourselves

[Critical accounts of the rise of algorithms have placed great emphasis
on the power of algorithms to visualize, to reprogram vision, or indeed
even to "see" that which is not otherwise available to human regimes of
visuality.]{.underline} Similar to the spatial arrangement, this primacy
of the visual register has also annexed what could count as the ethics
and politics of algorithms. [There are two curiously twinned accounts of
contemporary algorithms in relation to regimes of sight and vision. The
first is that algorithms operate on a plane in excess of human
visibility and at scales that are inscrutable to the human. The second
is that algorithms themselves have an enhanced capacity to visualize the
invisible, to see, scan, and search volumes and varieties of data
heretofore unavailable to human senses]{.underline}. Indeed, this
intersection of machinic and human vision comes to the fore in the
espoused ethics of public inquiries into the state's deployment of
automated algorithms for the government of the population. For example,
in the UK parliamentary inquiry following the Edward Snowden disclosures
of widespread automated data analysis, a peculiar kind of virtue was
found in the notion that, in machine learning intelligence, "only a tiny
fraction of those collected are ever seen by human eyes." Similarly in
the United States, the former director of national intelligence James
Clapper likened the nsa's algorithmic analysis of citizens' data to a
form of library in which few books are "actually read" and where the
output of the system supplies "the books that we need to open up and
actually read." There is an acute problem, then, with the widespread
appeal to ethical codes that regulate what algorithms or humans do or do
not see. It is a problem, I suggest, with its roots in the privileging
of sight and vision over other forms of making things perceptible.
"Vision cannot be taken," writes Orit Halpern in her wonderful book
Beautiful Data, "as an isolated form of perception" but must be
considered "inseparable from other senses." To act and to be responsible
for action, an algorithm need not "see" or "read" but need only make
something or someone perceptible and available to the senses. In this
book I situate the ethics and politics of algorithms within a genealogy
of technologies of perception. [Contemporary algorithms are changing the
processes by which people and things are rendered perceptible and
brought to attention. This is definitively not merely a matter of making
things amenable to vision and indeed is frequently a matter of
sustaining something beneath the visual register and yet
perceptible.]{.underline} As art historian Jonathan Crary writes, "Ideas
about perception and attention were transformed" alongside the
historical "emergence of new technological forms of spectacle, display,
projection, attention, and recording." Understood in this way, the
transformation of perception involves changes in how the perceiving
subject thinks about what could be brought to attention, changes in the
horizon of possibility of human action. As with the advent of the
technologies of printing press, camera, or cinema, so the advent of the
machine learning algorithm implies a reworking of what it means to
perceive and mediate things in the world. This is not a process that is
effectively captured by the idea that automated systems are undermining
or superseding human forms of perception and action. To foreground
instruments of perception, or what Henri Bergson terms "organs of
perception," is to breach conventional distinctions between humans and
machines and acknowledge the entangled nature of all forms of
perception. Bergson insists on the shared limits of perception across
science and ordinary everyday experience, so that "ordinary knowledge is
forced, like scientific knowledge," to divide up time into perceptible
slices, to "take things in a time broken up into particles." Whether the
organ of perception is microscope, telescope, eye, camera, or algorithm,
perception is attuned to action, to the dividing up of movement into
points on a trajectory so that they can be acted on. "What you have to
explain," he writes, is not "how perception arises, but how it is
limited, since it should be the image of the whole, and is in fact
reduced to the image of that which interests you." [Following Bergson's
insight on how an organ of perception seizes the object of interest from
its environment, to consider algorithms as instruments of perception is
to appreciate the processes of feature extraction, reduction, and
condensation through which algorithms generate what is of interest in
the data environment. Confronted by something of a moral panic
surrounding the expansive volumes of "big data" and powers of
surveillance of automated systems,]{.underline} my emphasis on practices
of perception foregrounds precisely the opposing process: the reducing,
distilling, and condensing of particles of interest from a whole. [A
defining ethical problem of the algorithm concerns not primarily the
power to see, to collect, or to survey a vast data landscape, but the
power to perceive and distill something for action.]{.underline}
Algorithms function with something like an aperture---an opening that is
simultaneously a narrowing, a closure, and an opening onto a scene. Let
us consider, for example, an algorithm designer working in the UK
defense sector, demonstrating the capacity of his deep neural network
algorithms to recognize a mistaken civilian target amid a crowded data
environment of drone images. He shows a slice through time as a vehicle
travels away from the center of Kandahar, Afghanistan. He explains the
problem for the decision: that this could be a suspect vehicle or,
crucially, a school bus taking children home to villages outside the
city. The algorithms had learned to recognize a school bus through
training data that supplied images of predominantly yellow US-style
buses. The designer explains that his algorithm is aggregated with many
others to generate a single actionable output--- target/no target---but
to do this he must necessarily reduce and condense the patterns of
interest from a volume of input data. The training data---and the humans
who labeled it---have conditioned the cnn algorithm to carve out and
value some objects and to discard others. In this part of Afghanistan,
some of the school buses are indeed in the spatial form of a US-style
school bus, but others still are open-back trucks repurposed for
transporting scholars. My point is that a potential act of violence,
such as a school bus wrongfully targeted by a drone strike, resides not
primarily in the vertical surveilling and collecting of data, but in
fact in the horizontal arraying of possible patterns of interest lodged
within the algorithm itself. As an aperture instrument, the algorithm's
orientation to action has discarded much of the material to which it has
been exposed. At the point of the aperture, the vast multiplicity of
video data is narrowed to produce a single output on the object. Within
this data material resides the capacity for the algorithm to recognize,
or to fail to recognize, something or someone as a target of interest.
The ethical stakes of what Mark Hansen calls "potential perceptual
reconfiguration" applied to my cloud ethics necessarily involves
something like a reopening of the process of the algorithm's reduction
of a multiplicity to one. [What is happening in this process of
condensing plural possible pathways to a single output? When an
algorithm determines whether a vehicle is a military or a civilian
target, or when it decides if a public protest contains latent dangerous
propensities, it reduces the heterogeneity of durational time to
perceive the attributes of an object and their differences of degree
from other objects encountered in a past set of data.]{.underline} The
question of what this crowd could be, what this vehicle might do, the
frustrations or discomforts of the actual lived experience of waiting or
gathering persist as indeterminacies in the hidden layers of the
algorithm. Even within the archive of training data---sometimes just a
Google ImageNet dataset of labeled images of school buses---are the
residual contingencies of durational time, with all the past lived
moments supplying norms and anomalies for the algorithm to learn. "My
own duration, such as I live it in the impatience of waiting," reflects
Gilles Deleuze, "serves to reveal other durations that beat to other
rhythms, that differ in kind from mine." To respond to the perceptual
power of the algorithm and to prize open the aperture of the single
output is to trace the other durations that continue to beat in the
discarded data, the multiple other potential pathways that could be
mapped between fragments.

### Link---Big Data

#### Collection of "big data" manipulates human behavior and creates the new surveillance capitalism

Surveillance Capitalism Throughout history, surveillance systems have
undermined freedom and democracy. In South Africa, surveillance has been
central to systems of oppression, from the identity passes issued to
indigenous people under colonialism to the reference books (dompas)
administered by the apartheid government. [With digital technology, the
capacity for surveillance has expanded, and is being used by those with
power for political, economic, and social control.]{.underline} South
Africa is often deemed the "protest capital of the world", and many
protesters are subjected to mass and targeted surveillance. This
threatens freedom of expression. Civil society activists and the poor
are the most vulnerable, and they face the most violent repercussions
for their political activity. Journalists, judges, politicians,
whistleblowers, unions, and academics are among the many surveillance
targets in recent years. Today's surveillance is much more pervasive
than in times past. A new, digitally-powered form of surveillance
capitalism -- the economic exploitation of society through corporate and
state mass surveillance -- is spreading to South Africa from abroad.
This threatens our civil rights and liberties by subjecting us to a life
continuously watched and recorded by states and corporations. [Big Data
refers to the drastic expansion of data collected about people and
nature in today\'s digital world, and the use of computers to make sense
of it by identifying patterns and correlations. Information about things
such as what people like, what websites they visit, and who they are
friends with has provided Big Tech corporations with data that can be
used to manipulate people's behavior with targeted advertisements and
addictive features. For instance, Silicon Valley corporations are
capturing market share by using "brain hacking" -- the systematic
exploitation of psychological vulnerabilities to hook consumers into
their products and services so they will view more ads. Big Data
underpins these practices, and is spreading fast across society.
US-based transnational corporations, led by "GAFAM" (Google, Amazon,
Facebook, Apple, Microsoft), are the centre of this brave new world.
They continuously collect every little detail about us from our
computers, mobile phones, and internet activities. As technology
advances, they are expanding their data fiefdoms by building
surveillance into household gadgets like Amazon Echo and Google Nest.
Through the Internet of Things, everyday appliances like "smart"
refrigerators, thermostats, trash cans, toothbrushes, and even diapers
are being manufactured to collect ever more consumer data.]{.underline}

### Link---Cyber---Attribution 

#### Legal resolution of the attribution problem is an attempt to [reinscribe]{.underline} cyberspace within the state's control.

War and politics in this realm then begin not only to fix upon the most
important nodes in various economic, legal, and military networks but
also to reshape the connections and nodes of these networks to their
advantage. War becomes the ability not only to occupy and control nodes
or connect and disconnect parts of the network but to shape the space
and networks that underlie the global battle space. Perhaps this is part
of the reason that late-twentieth- and early-twenty-first-century war
begins to fixate so heavily on the spectacle. It may be that, [rather
than war becoming]{.underline} a [purely virtual]{.underline}
phenomenon, [war has]{.underline} instead [taken the **naming of reality
itself** as its object]{.underline}. If one can effectively intervene in
the multiple networks that define the twenty-first-century globe, [it
may now be possible to win conflicts **without even fighting
them**]{.underline}. Through these attempts to win by defining the
battle, [war has become actively engaged in the process of representing
both the world and the ability to destroy it]{.underline}. In that
sense, we must add a provision to Galloway's claim: "[There is **one
game in town**]{.underline}: [a **positivistic dominant** of
**reductive**]{.underline}, [**systemic efficiency** and
**expediency**]{.underline}. [Offering a **counter-aesthetic** in the
face of such systematicity is the **first step** toward building a
**poetics** for it]{.underline}, [a language of **representability**
adequate to it]{.underline}."55 [These dominant forces are equally
invested in **destroying** this game]{.underline}, [in **upsetting** the
positivist investments of their enemies]{.underline}. [War
machines]{.underline}, [states]{.underline}, [and corporations are
already invested in representing the complex space of these networks and
in destroying both networks and their representations]{.underline}. The
cases of Comment Crew and Stuxnet demonstrate that there is not merely a
reductive system of efficiency. Rather, the powers of war and conflict
are invested in both speed and slowness; pure unnamed flow and the
poetics of representation; construction and destruction. Thus any
resistance to these forces of war and control, while it certainly must
utilize these tactics, cannot rely solely on representation and slowness
against the speed and complexity of war and domination.

INTERNATIONAL LAW AND TERRITORIALITY

[The **speed** at which these spaces are created and
reconfigured]{.underline} creates dynamic forces that [threaten to
**destabilize** the institutions that exist within these
spaces]{.underline}. One need only [look at the **difficulty** that
governments face in **legislating** and **regulating networks** to see
how **destabilizing** these spaces can be]{.underline}. [The **constant
reconfiguration** of the]{.underline} technological, topological, and
conceptual [nature of these spaces **impedes** their integration into
**legal frameworks**]{.underline}. For instance, [the **attribution
problem** stems from the **reach** and **speed** with which individuals
can connect and disconnect]{.underline} from the global Internet. This
particular difficulty is often taken up in legal discussions surrounding
cyberwar. Although the problem of attributing attacks affects the
security of systems, it is more often a political and legal problem. [If
it is **impossible** to assign responsibility]{.underline} for an attack
convincingly, political and military [responses become
**difficult**]{.underline}. A number of [legal solutions]{.underline} to
both the attribution problem and this more general destabilization of
quickly shifting spaces have been proposed, but many [**quickly** run
into challenges]{.underline}.

One potential legal remedy to the uncontrollability of networks has been
to make individual nations responsible for attacks originating in their
territories.56 This attempt to solve the attribution problem shifts the
burden of responsibility to the countries from which attacks emanate,
regardless of their political or military involvement in the attacks.
Although a number of legal scholars, especially from the United States,
have suggested this potential approach, their optimism is usually
tempered by the admission that the vast majority of attacks traverse
networks inside the United States owing to the density of well-networked
(and often insecure) computers in that country.57 [It seems **ultimately
unlikely** that the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [or many other countries would **actually push such
an agenda** on an international level]{.underline}, [because they would
then be responsible for a **vast number** of attacks and compromised
machines]{.underline}. [Aside from]{.underline} the question of [whether
such a solution is **politically viable** or would **actually serve to
decrease** the rate of attack]{.underline}, it is interesting in that
[it attempts to **reassert the geographic territoriality** and
**responsibility of nations** over the network]{.underline}. Moreover,
[these]{.underline} attempts [mark a willingness]{.underline} among
these authors [to **give up** identity in favor of a new
territoriality]{.underline}. The [proponents]{.underline} of this plan
[seem so frustrated by attacks that they are willing to forgo knowing
the identity of attackers]{.underline} (whether they are military,
paramilitary, rogue agents, etc.) [by assigning responsibility to those
with national political control]{.underline} over territory.

An American legal scholar and a computer scientist, Jeremy and Ariel
Rabkin, have gone so far as to suggest that the United States
reintroduce the practice of issuing "letters of marque" to counter
cyberattacks. Letters of marque were a practice for dealing with pirates
up until the middle of the nineteenth century. With a letter of marque,
a privateer would be authorized by a government to attack and capture
pirate vessels. Thus, while the government did not take responsibility
for the reprisal, it would offer legal protection for privateering. The
notion proposed by the Rabkins would have the U.S. government offer
letters of marque to domestic hackers to attack particular hackers in
other countries. They are clear about the claimed benefits of
privateering, both historically and contemporarily: "In practice,
letters of marque often were issued to those who had learned the craft
of capturing prize at sea without any government authorization.
Governments issuing authorization brought these raiders under more state
control in return for offering them more state protection."58 [The
extent to which some scholars of cyberwar are willing to go to
**reassert state** and **territorial control** over its complicated
existence in cyberspace is]{.underline} at times
**[astounding]{.underline}**. [This is not to suggest that an unraveling
of state control over cyberspace or territory is
**inevitable**]{.underline}. [The **opposite** may be true]{.underline}:
[that we are **condemned** to live in a **bordered**]{.underline},
**[nationalized]{.underline}**, [**territorial** world for
**centuries**]{.underline}. [What is surprising]{.underline} about the
Rabkins' suggestion [is the **intensity** of their response to the fear
that an uncontrolled military force might grow outside of the state's
control]{.underline}. [Rather than **rethinking the
relationship**]{.underline} between state, territory, and war, [they
seem to **reach for any legal metaphor** to recapture these events in
the space of law and territory]{.underline}. They are keenly aware that
one of the effects of letters of marque is to bring privateers under
some state control. They are willing to return to privateering so as to
guarantee that everything falls into the state/territorial system at
least to the highest degree possible.

Both of [these attempts]{.underline} appear to [try to **reinscribe
cyberspace** into the space of the **nation**]{.underline}: the first
simply by using the physical location of servers to inscribe cyberspace
in national law and the second by treating cyberspace as analogous to
the high seas and legalizing privateering. In both cases, the authors
see war located on the Internet as problematic for state control. [This
fear testifies to a **loosening** of the state's control over
space]{.underline}, or at least the new spaces created through modern
communication technologies.

This is not to say that such a process is historically unique but rather
that cyberwar can be understood as part of a process of militarization
creating smooth space, Deleuze and Guattari's term for an open space
across which forces are able to move uninterrupted. They define this
type of space against striated space, the space of law and the state, in
which one is held in place and blocked from movement. Their concepts of
smooth and striated space share much with Castell's distinction between
spaces of flow and spaces of place. The distribution and configuration
of these spaces are central to contemporary politics. As Deleuze and
Guattari suggest, the state "does not just go from the smooth to the
striated, it reconstitutes smooth space; it reimparts smooth in the wake
of the striated. It is true that this new nomadism accompanies a
worldwide war machine whose organization exceeds the State apparatuses
and passes into energy, military-industrial, and multinational
complexes."59 This is not to suggest that these are necessarily spaces
of liberation or freedom. Rather, [these spaces can become the **most
terrifying sites of state violence**]{.underline}. One could easily
imagine that smooth spaces inhabited by pirates and privateers could be
more violent than the interiors of state control. Thus [we must draw a
**distinction** between the spaces in which the state **acts** and
spaces the state can **control**]{.underline}. [These spaces that are
opened for **military intervention** often turn into spaces in which the
state acts but is ultimately unable to control]{.underline} and is thus
forced to appropriate and integrate privateering, piracy, and other
forces that exceed the state and potentially destabilize it.

The militarization of new spaces is not unequivocally on the side of
expanded state control. Rather, it appears that [the expansion and
distortion of the space of war may ultimately **undermine** the state's
relation to its territory]{.underline}, [requiring the creation of
**novel legal regimes** or the reintroduction of **old
institutions**]{.underline}, such as privateering, [to **reappropriate**
these destabilizing spaces to state control]{.underline}. [These spaces
are **not frictionless networks**]{.underline} over which the state
unceasingly expands its control. It is [the complexity]{.underline},
multiplicity, and polyvocal nature [of these spaces]{.underline} and
those systems that inhabit them that [**continually challenge** state
attempts to]{.underline} fix, stabilize, and [manage them]{.underline}.

### Link---Cyber---Encryption

#### Cryptography is a [double-edged sword]{.underline}. The aff's attempt to completely control encryption [turns against itself]{.underline}.

**Joque, 18**---PhD from the European Grad School, researches
philosophy, technology and media and is the visualization librarian at
the University of Michigan, go blue (Justin, "Distributed Denial of
Service: Cybernetic Sovereignty," *Deconstruction Machines: Writing in
the Age of Cyberwar*, Chapter 3, 121-125, dml)

As the state summons a counterwriting against the tendencies of the
universe, it increasingly risks itself in the process. As we saw in the
example of Tor, it is often the war machine that takes advantage of this
counterwriting against, or at least outside, the state. Both the state
and the war machine have an uncertain relationship to cryptography and
the ability of citizenry to write in secret. [The state appears at once
to **promote** and **develop** cryptography]{.underline}, [especially as
a support for modern networked-based capitalism]{.underline}, [and at
the same time it moves to **undermine** and **defeat**
cryptography]{.underline}. Moreover, since the invention of publickey
cryptography, when we speak of the desire for and promotion of
cryptography, we must remember that we are referring to the ability not
only to send secret messages but also to authenticate and prove one's
identity. Thus both states and war machines arrive at the public
realization of the universe's tendency toward strong cryptography in a
difficult situation. If, as Foucault suggests in his lecture series
Security, Population, Territory, the function of the modern state is to
secure the population, [the state both **requires** cryptography to
secure digital spaces and the digital population but must then
**defeat** cryptography to secure its physical population]{.underline}.
[The ability to guarantee secrets becomes **critical** for maintaining
long-distance communication networks but at the same time threatens
to]{.underline} empower secret conspiracies that would **[turn against
the state]{.underline}**.

To better understand what is at stake in the state's relation to
cryptography in particular, and more generally in relation to cyberwar
and the militarization of networks, it is helpful to trace these
developments through Foucault's work on the state vis-à-vis its
population.24 Foucault outlines three historical modes of operation of
the state: sovereignty, societies of discipline, and finally, societies
of security. He cautions, "There is not a series of successive elements,
the appearance of the new causing the earlier ones to disappear. . .what
above all changes is the dominant characteristic."25 Still, the most
contemporary in this list, security societies, has as its most notable
element the creation of a population that must be secured as a whole.
Foucault says of security,

Security will try to plan a milieu in terms of events or series of
events or possible elements, of series that will have to be regulated
within a multivalent and transformable framework. The specific space of
security refers then to a series of possible events; it refers to the
temporal and the uncertain, which have to be inserted within a given
space. The space in which a series of uncertain elements unfold is, I
think, roughly what one can call the milieu.26

To control this milieu, the state intervenes in a population that is
treated as a biological entity. Norms and limits are discovered against
which to measure the population. In contrast to previous forms of the
state,

the milieu appears as a field of intervention in which, instead of
affecting individuals as a set of legal subjects capable of voluntary
actions---which would be the case with sovereignty---and instead of
affecting them as a multiplicity of organisms, of bodies capable of
performances, and of required performances---as in discipline--- one
tries to affect, precisely, a population. I mean a multiplicity of
individuals who . . . essentially only exist biologically bound to the
materiality within which they live.27

Security thus takes a space and a biological population that exists
within that space and attempts to maintain control over the uncertain
events of the milieu and the embedded population. The population, as
biological entity, is measured against a norm and securitized to
maintain the desired norm. This relation, between the state and a
population that must be accounted for as a whole, radically changes in
our contemporary era, especially under the threat of cyberwar.

[The advent of cyberwar]{.underline}, especially [with its cryptographic
concerns]{.underline}, [adds to the complexity of the state's desire for
security]{.underline}. [As **more** and **more** of our daily activities
occur online]{.underline} and more infrastructure is supported and made
vulnerable by its connection to the global Internet, [the state becomes
responsible for a **digital milieu** and a **digital population** as
much as it is responsible for a **biological population**]{.underline}.
The state's quest for security becomes bifurcated between a topographic
and topological space, a biological population and a digital population.
Cryptography bifurcates along similar lines and now fills a dual
function. [On one hand]{.underline}, [cryptography has become the
**linchpin** to security online]{.underline}. Without the ability to
both send secure messages and identify individuals, there would exist no
way to use the Internet for any but the most trivial functions.
Cryptography thus becomes a requirement for security online and for the
physical infrastructure connected to these digital networks. [On the
other hand]{.underline}, [cryptography allows the exchange of
messages]{.underline} across the globe [**beyond** the watchful eyes of
security agencies and militaries]{.underline}. Cryptography, in a sense,
cuts between the war machine and the state, becoming a necessity and a
threat to both.

The problem posed by cryptography is not an entirely new problem for the
state. While, on one hand, it is a problem of spatiality, between
topographic space and topological space and between a digital population
and a biological population, it is also a problem of the relationship
between the mass and the individual. [Cryptography is **critical** for
the security of]{.underline} the mass of online functions, for [the
global totality of the Internet, but an individual's use of cryptography
can **easily threaten** the digital or physical whole]{.underline}.
Cryptography thus repeats a central problem Foucault outlines in
relation to the rise of security and the art of government, or
governmentality, as he refers to it. Foucault traces the roots of the
modern security state to the Christian pastorate, which he claims to be

paradoxically distributive since, of course, the necessity of saving the
whole entails, if necessary, accepting the sacrifice of a sheep that
could compromise the whole. . . On the other hand, and this is the
paradox, the salvation of a single sheep calls for as much care from the
pastor as does the whole flock; there is no sheep for which he must not
suspend all his other responsibilities and occupations, abandon the
flock, and try to bring it back.28

Both the mass and the individual must be saved, and each at the expense
of the other. For Foucault, the pastoral problematic does not stumble
upon an already constituted individual who is opposed to the mass it
constitutes; rather, the pastorate "is a form of individualization that
will not be acquired through the relationship to a recognized truth,
\[but\] will be acquired instead through the production of an internal,
secret, and hidden truth."29 The Christian pastorate constructs both an
individual and mass that come to be diametrically opposed and require
salvation both through and against the other.

Foucault goes on to say that as this system of pastoral power is adopted
by the state, its logic disregards the problem of the mass and the
individual.30 Thus, for Foucault, [the state]{.underline} as an
institution of governmentality does away with the problem of the mass
and the individual. It [decides **clearly** on the side of the **mass**
at the expense of the **individual**]{.underline}. But he also notes
that as the state becomes a more liberal institution and its aims become
"a matter of insuring that the state only intervenes to regulate, or
rather to allow the well-being, the interest of each to adjust itself in
such a way that it can actually serve all,"31 the issue of this relation
between mass and individual is maintained as an aporetic concern of the
state. We see it arise precisely in the relation between the state,
cryptography, and its defenses against cyberwar. [The whole **requires
cryptography to function** in a digital world]{.underline}, [but the
individual's access to cryptography **threatens the
whole**]{.underline}. At the same time, the individual, as potential
threat to the mass, must somehow be barred from full access to digital
security. The paradox the Christian pastorate stumbles upon returns as a
key aspect of the apparatus of security. Moreover, [even if the state
were to find an **optimal balance** between the two]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} war machine's [attempts to both secure its own systems
and disrupt the security of enemy systems **further destabilize** any
technopolitical balances]{.underline}.

### Link---Cyber---Securitization

#### The aff's hypersecuritization of cybersecurity stems from itself -- disasters of cyber systems happen as a result of their initial investment

Hypersecuritization The first concept, hypersecuritization, has been
introduced by Buzan (2004:172) to describe an expansion of
securitization beyond a ''normal'' level of threats and dangers by
defining ''a tendency both to exaggerate threats and to resort to
excessive countermeasures.'' This definition has an objectivist ring to
it in that to identify ''exaggerated'' threats implies that there are
''real'' threats that are not exaggerated. Moreover, the question of
whether a securitization is seen as ''exaggerating'' concerns the degree
to which it is successful (unsuccessful securitizations are seen as
''exaggerating'') and is not part of the grammatical specificities of
sectors. [Thus we suggest to drop the ''exaggerated'' from the
definition of hypersecuritization and to apply it to the cyber sector to
identify the striking manner in which cyber security discourse hinges on
multi-dimensional cyber disaster scenarios that pack a long list of
severe threats into a monumental cascading sequence and the fact that
neither of these scenarios has so far taken place.]{.underline} All
securitizations do of course have an element of the hypothetical in that
they constitute threats that must be countered, and thus mobilize an
''if-then'' logic, but what distinguishes hypersecuritizations from
''mere'' securitization is their instantaneity and inter-locking effects
(Denning 1999:xiii). [This combination draws critically from the
securitization of the network (Deibert 2002), yet the power of
hypersecuritization stems not only from a securitization of the network
itself, but from how a damaged network would cause societal, financial,
and military break-down hence bringing in all other referent objects and
sectors.]{.underline} Securitizations always mobilize the specter of the
future to some extent, but most nevertheless articulate the past as a
legitimating reference that underscores the gravity of the situation.
Looking to the Cold War, the logic of nuclear deterrence relied upon
projections of a nuclear exchange that had not taken place, yet there
were the devastations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to be used as a
yardstick for what nuclear war would imply. Cyber securitizations on the
other hand have no similar history of founding incidents to base
themselves on but try to conjure historical analogies such as
''electronic Pearl Harbors'' (Bendrath 2003:50).7 The combination of
cascading disasters and the absence of a prior incident of that
magnitude creates a crucial ambiguity within cyber security discourse.
The extreme reliance on the future and the enormity of the threats
claimed at stake makes the discourse susceptible to charges of
''exaggeration,'' yet the scale of the potential catastrophe
simultaneously raises the stakes attached to ignoring the warnings.8
Turning the absence of prior incidences in the opposite direction, the
difficulty of saying that it could not happen also creates a powerful
space for the projection of the (im)possible. [The hypersecuritization
of the entire network in cyber security creates an obvious resemblance
to environmental security discourse where the fate of the planet is
claimed at stake. Both discourses also emphasize irreversibility: once a
species is extinct or a digital system gone, they can never be recreated
in full.]{.underline} Yet, there are also crucial differences between
the two discourses. [First, the speed of the threat scenarios differ
with cyber security gaining its power from the instantaneity of the
cascading effects whereas environmental security usually allows for a
gradual accumulation of threats and dangers until a certain threshold
may be reached and events accelerate. This establishes different
modalities of urgency and hence different spaces for political
intervention.]{.underline}9 Second, there is a crucial difference in
terms of the possibility of visualizing threats, and hence for how
securitizing actors communicate to their audiences (Williams 2003). [The
digital, networked character of cyber security---and the absence of
prior disasters---is hard to represent through images, whereas
environmental security discourse may mobilize for example endangered and
extinct species as well as melting ice caps and forests devastated by
acid rain or clear-cutting.]{.underline}

Securitizing Digital Systems: The Referent Objects of Cyber Security The
history of cyber security as a securitizing concept begins with the
disciplines of Computer and Information Science. One, if not the first,
usage of cyber security was in the Computer Science and
Telecommunications Board's (CSTB) report from 1991, Computers at Risk:
Safe Computing in the Information Age which defined ''security'' as the
''protection against unwanted disclosure, modification, or destruction
of data in a system and also \[to\] the safeguarding of systems
themselves'' (CSTB 1991:2). Security comprised technical as well as
human aspects and ''it has significant procedural, administrative,
physical facility, and personnel components'' (CSTB 1991:17).
[Crucially, threats to cyber security do not only arise from (usually)
intentional agents, but also from systemic threats. These systemic
threats, defined by Hundley and Anderson (1995 ⁄ 1996:232) as
''cyberspace safety'' stems from the inherent unpredictability of
computers and information systems which by themselves ''create
unintended (potentially or actually) dangerous situations for themselves
or for the physical and human environments in which they are embedded.''
Threats arise from software as well as hardware failures and cannot be
corrected through perfecting digital technology and programming; there
is, in short, an inherent ontological insecurity within computer
systems]{.underline} (Edwards 1996:290--2; Denning 1999:12). ''Computer
security'' would not, however, in most cases by itself qualify as a
security concept according to the Copenhagen School. As Helen Nissenbaum
points out, the majority of computer scientists adopt a technical
discourse that is focused on developing good programs with a limited
number of (serious) bugs and systems that are difficult to penetrate by
outside attackers. [In the move from ''computer security'' to ''cyber
security,'' this technical discourse is linked to the securitizing
discourse ''developed in the specialized arena of national security''
(Nissenbaum 2005:65). ''Cyber security'' can, in short, be seen as
''computer security'' plus ''securitization.'']{.underline} In the 1991
CSTB report it is argued that ''We are at risk'' and in a remarkable
mobilization of securitizing prose that ''Tomorrow's terrorist may be
able to do more damage with a keyboard than with a bomb.'' No major
attacks have been launched so far, but it is a key element of
securitizing discourse to argue that if action is not undertaken then
serious incidents will materialize in the near future, thus ''there is
reason to believe that our luck will soon run out'' (CSTB 1991:7--8).
The constitution of a much too complacent audience that does not realize
the magnitude of these dangers is another key staple of securitizing
discourse, and the CSTB laments that ''Very few individuals not
professionally concerned with security ... have ever been directly
involved in or affected by a computer security incident. ... most people
have difficulty relating to the intricacies of malicious computer
actions'' (CSTB 1991:159--61). Eleven years later, most Americans have
been exposed to (scares of) computer viruses, worms, and hackers, yet
the Board complains that in spite of the reports produced over the past
years, ''not much has changed with respect to security as it is
practiced.'' As the threats to cyber security have increased while the
countermeasures have not, ''our ability and willingness to deal with
threats have, on balance, changed for the worse'' (CSTB 2002:2). In
another attempt to stress the urgency and wake up policy makers and the
broader public, the report is titled Cybersecurity Today and Tomorrow:
Pay Now or Pay Later. A similar tone is struck a year later in the
so-far most authoritative and comprehensive statement of US cyber
security policy: President Bush's The National Strategy to Secure
Cyberspace which opens by asserting that ''In the past few years,
threats in cyberspace have risen dramatically.'' Although a large-scale
cyber attack has not yet taken place, this is no time to ''be too
sanguine'' as ''the attack tools and methodologies are becoming widely
available, and the technical capability and sophistication of users bent
on causing havoc or disruption is improving'' (The National Strategy
2003:viii). Key to understanding the potential magnitude of cyber
threats is the networked character of computer systems. These networks
''control physical objects such as electrical transformers, trains,
pipeline pumps, chemical vats, and radars'' (The National Strategy
2003:6--7) and attacks---or ''cyberdisasters''---would ''compromise
systems and networks in ways that could render communications and
electric power distribution difficult or impossible, disrupt
transportation and shipping, disable financial transactions, and result
in the theft of large amounts of money'' (CSTB 2002:6). Although not
necessarily directly connected, the magnitude and simultaneity of these
attacks would have cascading effects and thus networked consequences for
referent objects beyond networks themselves. Networked computers have
also dissolved the traditional boundary protecting the territorial
nation state, ''the infrastructure that makes up cyberspace---software
and hardware---is global in its design and development'' and cyber
attackers may operate at a distance obfuscating ''their identities,
locations, and paths of entry'' (The National Strategy 2003:7; Yould
2003). To give an indication of how an attack transgresses territorial
boundaries, RAND's ''The Day After... in Cyberspace II'' exercise in
1996 drew up a list (Anderson and Hearn 1996:4--5) including electronic
looting of European and American banks by (unspecified) Russians,
software computer viruses causing financial havoc and plane and train
crashes, power grid fall-outs at airbases, malfunctioning of ATMs and
news broadcasts, and stock market manipulation. RAND's scenario shows
aptly how cyber security discourse moves seamlessly across distinctions
normally deemed crucial to Security Studies: between individual and
collective security, between public authorities and private
institutions, and between economic and political-military security. The
private sector's fear of hackers stealing large sums of money,
intellectual property owner's worry that file sharing compromises their
rights and revenues (Nissenbaum 2005:68), and public, private, and civil
society scares that bugged software and computer viruses will have
damaging consequences produce a powerful blending of private-economic
and public-national security concerns. Not only are large parts of the
networks, hardware, and software privately produced and owned and thus
governed by financial considerations, but the security logics of the
economic and the cyber sector have crucial similarities. The economic
sector is also ''rich in referent objects, ranging from individuals
through classes and states to the abstract and complex system of the
global market itself'' (Buzan et al. 1998:100), and in liberal economies
instability and risk taking is built into the logic of capitalism
itself. The modern economic system is, like the cyber network,
constituted by trans-border flows, and authority and sovereignty is more
ambiguously located than in traditional national-military security. It
is in both sectors often difficult to identify where an attack
originated, and with the global reach of the Internet⁄world economy,
tricky questions of responsibility and enforcement are continuous
sources of fraught cross-border and international treaty negotiations.
That said, cyber security does not fully mirror the economic sector
either: its securitizing potential exceeds that of the economic sector
as strictly defined (Buzan et al. 1998:116--7) and this in turn
allows---or is an indication of---a much stronger link to national
military security. Cyber security is not left to the liberal market, but
implies a complex constellation of public-private responsibility and
governmental authority. Drawing upon the individual-collective
resolution laid out above, the government consistently holds the private
sector co-responsible for cyber security: not only does the latter own
major parts of the computer network, it also possesses the
knowledge---''In general, the private sector is best equipped and
structured to respond to an evolving cyber threat'' (The National
Strategy 2003:ix). Mobilizing civil liberties discourse further invokes
a crucial balance between the public and the private that should not be
violated: ''The federal government should likewise not intrude into
homes and small businesses, into universities, or state and local
agencies and departments to create secure computer networks'' (The
National Strategy 2003:11). To the government this allows for a
distribution of the financial and political burden and it strategically
engages critics who point to privacy violations. To the private sector,
these securitizations boost its calls for the protection of intellectual
property rights, for vigilant prosecution of cyber crimes, and for
combating digital anonymity (Nissenbaum 2005:68). Negotiation of the
boundaries between the public and the private and between the economic
and the political thus couples the network-fragmentation implied by
''cyber'' with an understanding of business and government as sharing
the same goal. At the same time the political center still constitutes
the private sector as responsible for major parts of the digital realm.
[This academic and policy discourse articulates in sum a wide array of
threats to government, business, individuals, and society as a whole
perpetuated by hackers, criminals, terrorists, commercial organizations,
and nations that adopt cyber strategies for financial, ideological,
political, or military gain]{.underline} (Hundley and Anderson 1995 ⁄
1996:232). Yet obviously not all political or societal actors concur
with the manner in which official American cyber security discourse has
attempted to keep the public-private and individual-state resolutions in
place. As Ronald J. Deibert (2002) and Diana Saco (1999) have argued,
cyber security is a terrain on which multiple discourses and
(in)securities compete.6 Privacy advocates and cyber libertarians point
to governmental violations of personal security (Saco 1999), and
authoritarian (and not so authoritarian) regimes securitize transborder
information flows as threats to regime ⁄state security and national
(societal) identity in a way that expands the threat-referent object
constellation considerably (Deibert 2002). The question is therefore how
we incorporate this complexity into our theoretical framework without
loosing the sense of cyber security discourse as a distinct phenomenon?
Deibert (2002) argues that cyber security is constituted through four
separate discourses with distinct referent objects, threats, policy
options, and world orders: national security, state security (comprising
external threats to state sovereignty as well as internal threats to
regime security), private security, and network security, and Saco holds
that national and personal security compete (Saco 1999:270, 286). We
agree with Deibert that cyber security should be theorized as a sector
where multiple discourses may be found, yet we think that understanding
this multi-discursivity as arising from competing articulations of
constellations of referent objects, rather than separate referent
objects, better captures the securitizing and political dynamic of the
field. To see cyber security discourse as fragmenting along the lines of
distinct referent objects downplays the ways in which cyber security
discourse gains its coherence from making connections between referent
objects rather than operating at separate tracks. Particularly crucial
in the case of cyber security is the linkage between ''networks'' and
''individual'' and human collective referent objects. Thus it is not the
case that a private security discourse constitutes the individual as its
referent object, but rather that ''the individual'' of this discourse is
linked to societal and political referent objects. Take the example of
post-September 11 battles between governmental discourses legitimizing
digital surveillance and data-mining through securitizing reference to
the War on Terror and citizen groups fighting this legislation through
reference to basic civic liberties and privacy issues. These are not two
separate discourses with unrelated referent objects, but competing
articulations of the appropriate individual-state contracts of the
liberal state (Saco 1999:271). Moreover, it is not fully clear from
Deibert's and Saco's accounts whether private security discourse
operates through the political rather than the semantic modality of
security. This does not mean that cyber ''privacy'' cannot be
securitized, but this has to be mediated through a collective referent
object, either a political-ideological one, questioning the
appropriateness of the individual-state balance, and⁄ or a
national-societal one, mobilizing the values held to be the core of the
community's identity. Similarly, a securitization of the network cannot,
and does not, stop at the network itself: it is the implications of
network break-downs for other referent objects, ''society,'' ''the
regime,'' or ''the economy'' (which is, again, in turn linked to
''state'' and ''society'') that makes cyber securitization a plausible
candidate for political and media attention. Securitization works in
short by tying referent objects together, particularly by providing a
link between those that do not explicitly invoke a bounded human
collectively, such as ''network'' or ''individual,'' with those that do.
Contestation and multidiscursivity is thus found between competing
articulations of linked referent objects as well as by tracing the
potential internal instability of each discourse.

### Link---Death?

#### Foucault kindly and shyly, in his style, tells Deleuze: you know, I must confess to you that the word "desire" disgusts me. I would prefer to use the word "pleasure," would you agree? Deleuze does not agree at all.

**Bifo 20** (Franco "Bifo" Berardi, founder of the famous Radio Alice in
Bologna and an important figure in the Italian Autonomia movement, is a
writer, media theorist, and social activist, "Desire, Pleasure,
Senility, and Evolution") // 'ansel'

This essay is short and inconsistent. It grew out of a talk I gave at
the e-flux conference "Art After Culture" in June 2019. When I was
invited to speak, the subject I proposed was: "Desire, Pleasure,
Evolution." I will begin with a few things about those topics, but will
move on to other things, namely senility and evolution.

So, desire and pleasure. I recently discovered that somewhere---I don't
remember exactly where---Gilles Deleuze recounts the story of an
exchange between himself and Michel Foucault. Before leaving the house
of Deleuze, [Foucault kindly and shyly, in his style, tells Deleuze: you
know, I must confess to you that the word "desire" disgusts
me]{.underline}. [I would prefer to use the word "pleasure," would you
agree?]{.underline}

[Deleuze does not agree at all]{.underline}. [He absolutely disdains the
word "pleasure." Actually, in a lecture he delivered in Vincennes in
1973, Deleuze said something along the lines of: Plaisir, quel horrible
et atroce mot. Qu'est-ce que ça signifie? Le
décharge?]{.underline} [(Pleasure, what a horrible, atrocious word. What
does it mean? Discharge?)]{.underline}

This discussion between the two is revealing of a dimension of desire as
discussed by Deleuze and Félix Guattari that has always escaped me.
During my years in Paris in the late '70s, I first came to realize that
[desire is the engine that mobilizes social energies]{.underline}, [but
I did not consider at all the distinction between desire and
pleasure]{.underline}. [It wasn't until just last year that I understood
the difference, while reading about that exchange between Deleuze and
Foucault.]{.underline}

Of course, one can find an explication of the difference in **[Jean
Baudrillard]{.underline}, [the real wise man of the Parisian
scene]{.underline}** of the '70s and '80s. [[Baudrillard says]{.mark}:
desire, yes okay, the desire for beautiful things, but [beware that the
entire history of capitalism is based on permanent
desire]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Now[, in my old age I have come to (painfully) appreciate the difference
between desire and pleasure, and I understand that **[capitalism
is]{.mark}**, in fact, **[based on an endless postponement of pleasure,
and simultaneously on the permanent excitement of
desire]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Virtual capitalism---what I call
[**semiocapitalism**---**is an intensification of** ]{.mark}**both
[these conditions]{.mark}**, postponing pleasure and exciting
desire.]{.underline}

[Another catalyst for my realization of how they differ is feeling
physically, personally that growing old essentially means losing the
ability to access certain spheres of pleasure, while desire continues
undisturbed]{.underline}. Beyond my personal experience, and its
suggestion of a larger condition, there is something more interesting,
and more disturbing, in [[the]{.underline}
[relationship]{.underline}]{.mark} between the two. This
relationship---[[between the permanent burning of desire and the]{.mark}
inaccessibility, the [unattainability of pleasure]{.mark}---has
something to do with the present historical moment of transition, the
present step in human evolution]{.underline}.

[Why are older people so nervous? Cantankerous even? I don't even know
the meaning of this word, but it sounds right. Why are old people so
malignant]{.underline}?

I have two answers. [The first has to do with the disappearance of
neurons and synapses in old age]{.underline}: [the reduction in the
ability to process information, the loss of subtlety, the loss of
definition in the relationship between sensibility and
experience]{.underline}. [The second is that we---[**we**]{.mark}
humans, old humans in particular---**[tend to cling to life because we
think it is our private property. ]{.mark}This [life is mine, and I
don't want to lose this property]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[The denial of death is]{.mark} deeply [inscribed in the modern
mind]{.mark}. As the world's white population grows old, [this has
provoked]{.mark} something resembling a social psychosis]{.underline},
[[an aggressive grasping among the old for all that is left: naked
life]{.mark}, putrescent life]{.underline}.

At the end of his beautiful book The Order of Time, Carlo Rovelli writes
that **[[the fear of death is a mistake of
evolution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It is an error [provoked by the
inability to think the world without one's own presence]{.mark} within
it, an inability to think the world without me. Modern [culture
emphasizes the individual in continuous competition]{.mark} with other
individuals]{.underline}, [and consequently erases a sense of community
among people]{.underline}. Thus, [[it has turned death into something
that cannot be]{.mark} thought, said, or [psychically
elaborated]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Death is systematically denied, [which
in turn leaves the individual]{.mark} alone [in an infinite desert of
sadness]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and ultimately unable to see the
continuity among the individual and the community, among me and
you]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [[modern capitalism is based on]{.mark} an idolatry of
energy]{.underline}. [It is based on an obsession with [growth]{.mark},
expansion, [productivity]{.mark}, acceleration---[futurist obsessions
that have made senility unthinkable]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Why am I writing about these strange and slightly scary subjects? Why am
I talking about senility and death? Of course, the main reason is that
they are my problems. But, believe me, they're not my problems alone.
[They are two of the main problems of humankind in the
present]{.underline}. [[The denial of death, linked to the idolatry
of]{.mark} energy and [expansion]{.mark}, has turned decline and
un-growth into purely negative tendencies, and frugality into
scarcity]{.underline}. [So, in this sense, **[life has become a paranoid
fight against the passage of time]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[I strongly believe that [senescence is the]{.mark} (unseen or
unfathomed) [key to understanding the]{.mark} present historical
[conundrum]{.mark}, just as decline is simultaneously the problem and
the solution to the late-modern crisis]{.underline}.

[Firstly, we can surmise that this situation is due to demographic
reasons. Senility now tends to be the condition of most of the Western
population, and not only of the Western population]{.underline}. [[While
the African population grows exponentially]{.mark}, while [the
populations in the Middle East and on the Indian subcontinent]{.mark}
steadily [grow]{.mark}, [Western dominators]{.mark} and aggressors [are
ageing, they are losing energy]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} most of all, they
[are losing]{.mark} the [innocent faith in the future]{.mark} that
belongs mostly to younger people]{.underline}.

[The demographic gap between the population explosion in much of the
South and the decline in the North is probably one of the central
reasons for contemporary racism and aggressiveness]{.underline}. Old
people have transferred their declining potency to the machines, and
[[the war machine is in motion as a permanent menace against those
oppressed in the South]{.mark}, the colonized people who try to migrate
towards the declining Northern lands]{.underline}. [T[his is why we must
consider the crucial problem of senility if we want to understand
anything at al]{.underline}l]{.mark} about what is happening in the
social, cultural, and political spheres.

Bologna and an important figure in the Italian Autonomia movement, is a

Senility, and Evolution") // 'ansel'

I recently read Staying with the Trouble by Donna Haraway. When I read
Haraway, I don't understand everything, but I understand the essentials.
She says, in an ironic and beautiful way, that today there are two
reactions to technology. On one side, there are the techno-optimists,
who believe that technology will save humanity, the planet, and the
environment. On the other side are the techno-apocalyptics, who say no
way, technology will destroy everything. Haraway takes a different
stance: she instead tells us to keep calm. She says that [[it isn't a
tragedy that the human race is doomed to disappear]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Extinction is the new buzzword on the political scene]{.mark}
nowadays.]{.underline} Look at the enormous demonstrations organized by
children in Sweden, in Germany, in Italy, [everywhere in the
world]{.underline}. Millions of children marched on March 15, 2019.
[Their message is about extinction]{.underline}. They don't have a
political problem. [They simply say: [it's time to
panic]{.mark}]{.underline}. And look at Extinction Rebellion. [It's the
first time in human history, as far as I know, that extinction has
become the core concern of a political protest movement.]{.underline}

[I would not focus on rebelling against extinction]{.underline}. Can one
even rebel against extinction? I don't think so. You can deal with
extinction. You have to deal with extinction. [Extinction, by the way,
is not the worst thing that one can imagine for the future]{.underline}.
[[The worst thing imaginable is]{.mark} the war that will lead to
extinction---not death, but [the long-lasting agony that financial
capitalism has prepared for humankind]{.mark}. This is the real danger.
[Extinction is not so bad, if we compare it to
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.

After quoting Haraway, I want to quote the French philosopher and
psychoanalyst Catherine Malabou. She says that psychoanalysis has
undergone a shift from the analysis of sex and language to neurology.
The fields of sex and language have long been the focus of
[psychoanalytic theory and therapy]{.underline}. But when we speak of
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, or of panic attacks and depression, we can
see that they're not just problems related to sex and language. They
[concern the physical dimensions of neurology]{.underline}. It's
neurology nowadays that is at stake. It's the brain, not the mind. Or
better yet: not only the mind, but also the brain. Malabou, taking up
this thread, writes of trauma and neuroplasticity.

[Evolution must be rethought from scratch, from the point of view of the
relationship between desire and pleasure. Pleasure is the goal, the
aspiration]{.underline}. Over the past forty years[, I forgot about
pleasure because I was obsessed with desire, but now I understand that
**[the way out of capitalism]{.mark}** is the opposite: the way out [is
not desire, it is pleasure.]{.mark} And **[how can the brain find a new
balance of pleasure]{.mark}** in the present? This is the problem that
we are going to face in the coming years, in the coming
decade.]{.underline}

I want to dedicate this inconsistent essay to a friend who died in May
2019. The name of this friend is Nanni Balestrini.
[[Nanni]{.underline}]{.mark} was a poet, a novelist, and most of all a
recombiner. [He is the first poet in history of humankind who never
wrote a single word. He refused the dirty work of writing words. He
[asked]{.mark}: Why should I do that? Why should I spend my time writing
words? [I'm a poet. I don't write words]{.mark}]{.underline}. I take
signs from the infosphere, from the daily conversations of people in the
subway, from newspapers, from advertisements. [His
activity]{.underline}, he said, [was to recombine. **[Recombination is
also our task]{.mark}**, and we should take a cue from him]{.underline}.
But the question is: the recombination of what? The recombination of
meaning, of language, of desire, of pleasure. **[[Poetry is the
consistent and intentional recombination of what exists, with the aim of
creating what does not]{.mark} yet [exist]{.mark}]{.underline}.**

### Link---Diplomacy

#### Our interpretation evinces the new era of geopolitics -- the figure of the diplomat is no longer the representative of nation-states, but rather collectivizes [epistemological production]{.underline}. Our understanding of IR formulates a [new diplomat]{.underline} that promotes a [planetarization]{.underline} based around [technodiversity]{.underline}.

**Guinard et al 20** (Martin, curateur in charge of conferences and
publications, LUMA Arles; Bruno Latour, a French philosopher,
anthropologist and sociologist; Ping Lin, e-flux editors; "Editorial:
You and I Don't Live on the Same Planet" December 2020) //ansel is
hungry

On the occasion of the Taipei Biennial 2020 and together with the Taipei
Fine Arts Museum (TFAM), this special issue of e-flux journal will also
be available to read in Chinese in 2021. Titled "You and I Don't Live on
the Same Planet," the issue deals with an increasingly pressing
situation: [people "around" the world no longer agree on what it means
to live "on" earth]{.underline}---to such a radical extent that
[the]{.underline} foundational material and [existential]{.underline}
[[categories]{.underline} [of "earth" and "world" are profoundly
destabilized]{.underline}]{.mark}. It was often said at the beginning of
[Trump's]{.underline} time in office that he had no coherent strategy.
But today we can see that, on the contrary, he had an extremely coherent
[strategy]{.underline} that unfolded over four years without fail:
[privatization, deregulation, and isolating the US from any
international project]{.underline}. T[he message of this strategy was
clear: "[You and I don't live on the same planet]{.mark}." [What
becomes]{.mark} of politics [when opposing parties are taken as aliens
occupying separate earths]{.mark} altogether]{.underline}? [It is as if
the question no longer concerns different visions of the same planet,
but the composition and shape of several planets in conflict with one
another]{.underline}. [Pluralism has taken a much more explicit
ontological shape, as if we are literally living on different
earths]{.underline}---and earths that are at war with each other, as the
essay in this issue "Coping with Planetary Wars" explores.\
\
Successive "world orders" have treated planet earth as a fairly
homogeneous place where different kinds of resources, different kinds of
interests, and different kinds of sovereignties are all unified by one
homogenous and overarching concept of Nature. This issue explores the
consequences of what Eduardo Viveiro de Castro calls a shift from
multiculturalism to "multinaturalism." [As we approach a series of
tipping points, [we]{.mark} simultaneously [witness a division]{.mark}
between [those who]{.mark} seem to have [abandon]{.mark}ed planet
[earth]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[those who try to make it more
habitable]{.mark}, [and those whose cosmology never fit within the
ideals of the globalizing project]{.mark} in the first
place]{.underline}.\
\
[This state of division flies in the face of many twentieth-century
strategies of political ecology---especially the principle that the high
stakes of political ecology justify bypassing the tedious process of
negotiation and deliberation typical for political action]{.underline}.
Unanimity was supposed to rally the masses in a strong revolutionary
push to "save the planet." However, for the last forty years, we have
seen that ecology does not unify. Instead, ecology divides. It divides
the generations who will deal with its failures from those who will
escape its consequences; it divides the regions already affected by
climate disasters from those that are protected; within each region, it
divides the classes that suffer disproportionately from decisions made
by other classes; furthermore, it divides each one of us at the personal
level: for each decision we face, we know there are cascades of
unintended consequences that make it hard to distinguish the right
actions from the wrong ones. [What Bruno Latour has elsewhere called the
"New Climatic Regime" poses problems at every magnitude of scale and
blurs the classical political cartography]{.underline}.1 As Chun-Mei
Chuang writes in this issue: "Our place is neither conservative nor
progressive. It is molecular and planetary."\
\
[To characterize this new spatial configuration]{.underline}, Dipesh
Chakrabarty offers a brief history of ways of conceiving of the planets,
while Eduardo Viveiros de Castro and Déborah Danowski [explore the
consequences of the turn from a philosophy of history to a philosophy of
space, epitomized by the dismantling of the Axial Age
thesis]{.underline}.2\
\
In which direction should we go once these divisions are established and
assumed? [The objective here is to try to imagine procedures that would
allow these incommensurable worlds not so much to
"dialogue"]{.underline}---[which is not sufficient for the enormous
differences in ways of inhabiting the world---but to enter into
diplomatic negotiations]{.underline}.\
\
The [diplomacy that is evoked here does not lie within the existing
framework of nation-states]{.underline}, which have, to say the least,
many limitations with regard to the New Climate Regime. [[At the
international leve]{.mark}l, [the various UN Conferences]{.mark} of the
Parties (COPs) [have shown only moderate efficacy]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The state may be relevant for choosing whether to shift away from coal
or to impose regulations prohibiting the consumption of single-use
plastics, but [[when it comes to managing "trans-boundary
hazards]{.mark}" or reducing CO2 produced outside a state's borders,
**[a framework other than that of the nation-state and intergovernmental
negotiations needs to be imagined]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In this
issue, John Tresch, through his research on "cosmograms," searches for a
representation of this space to be invented, while Erika Balsom looks at
how documentary cinema can depict those encounters at the "third
register]{.underline}."\
\
As Adam Tooze argues in his essay, [diplomacy must be understood here as
a mode of negotiation in a world without arbiters, without a higher
authority capable of regulating the actions of the various collectives
concerned]{.underline}. Of course, [being horizontal rather than
vertical in its mode of operation does not mean that there is no balance
of power.]{.underline}\
\
Taiwan is perfectly positioned to explore this theme. Due to its
particular exclusion from the international order, the [Taiwanese
government has constantly created innovative ways of asserting its
existence]{.underline}. For example, in the 1990s it funded the
University of the African Future, an elite pan-African university in
Senegal whose history is traced in this issue by artists and curators
Hamedine Kane, Stéphane Verlet-Bottéro, Olivia Anani, and Lou Mo. But
[Taiwan is also a place where geological power is felt: an island that
trembles, where erosion is severe and typhoons common, and which does
not escape the problems of dependence on coal and
extractivism]{.underline}. In short, Taiwan is the ideal place to
explore geopolitics in both senses of the word: geological and
political.\
\
[It is on the basis of the cleavages [arising from this new
geopolitics]{.mark} that [a new form of diplomacy can be
formulated]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Isabelle Stengers writes in this
issue, the statement "'[we are divided' should first be understood ...
in an active sense, pointing to what divides us, that is, to what has
destroyed the feeling of interdependence as an operative political
affect]{.underline}." [In this sense, **[the figure of the diplomat is
changing]{.mark}**: [it is no longer a representative of a
state]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} **[rather an investigator of collective
dependencies who has the capacity to help these collectivities formulate
their obligations towards what must be
maintained]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In other words, the diplomat is an
"epistemic messenger]{.underline}," as Paul B. Preciado writes in this
issue. What remains to be explored is how to set up such collectives and
how to grant oneself the right to represent them.\
\
**[[When one world vampirically preys upon the resources of another,
diasporas may play the mediating role of stitching together torn
geographies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Nadia Yala Kisukidi proposes. She
emphasizes [[the]{.mark} [modalities of living in several worlds]{.mark}
at the same time [rather than assigning a place-based identity to
diasporas]{.mark}]{.underline}. By [exploring this form of geopolitics,
Kisukidi traces a path away from the "poor dialectic" that binds France
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo]{.underline}. [For Yuk Hui,
**[the figure of the diplomat mutates into that of the "knowledge
producer]{.mark}**]{.underline}**," [[promoting a planetarization based
on a diversity of ways to understand technology]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[A new [appreciation of technodiversity might help us break out
of]{.mark} the [global hegemony]{.mark} within which planetarization has
become stuck]{.underline}. [And with a concern that this situation may
result in new forms of "techno-molecular colonialism," Achille
[Mbembe]{.mark} [draws]{.mark} the contours of an ethic that is not
based on a "diaphanous universalism," but [on]{.mark} "commonality and
[incalculability]{.mark}" among the living.\]{.underline}
\
Relying on a more traditional definition of inter-state diplomacy,
Pierre Charbonnier urges ecological discourse to change its moralist
tone and develop a realpolitik approach. The author sees China's
announcement that it will achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 as a way of
asserting its power on the international stage. An undemocratic ecology
is on the march. Such a context can be instructive for European
environmental movements advocating ecological justice by consensus in
ways that limit their ability to defend concrete interests.\
\
Even with such a "realist" approach to the situation, can we truly
envisage negotiating with everyone? As the well-known doctrine goes,
"You can't negotiate with terrorists." But what of the state-subsidized
terror of preventing legal abortion? Preciado identifies a set of
countries, from the US to Afghanistan, that shares a set of repressive
policies on abortion. The diplomacy to be invented in this case must be
one that incorporates the logic of resistance, otherwise the opponents
of this techno-patriarchal bloc will lose all their leverage.

Adam Tooze, for his part, wants to clarify the modalities that make it
possible to speak between opposing camps: [one cannot negotiate with the
hyper-privileged who abandon earth to fly towards "planet
escape]{.underline}."3 [An irresponsible project that places so little
value on the lives of the masses can only be a crime against humanity,
whose adequate response is not diplomatic (horizontal) negotiation, but
a hierarchically organized (vertical) trial]{.underline}. According to
Tooze, t[he growing concern about a world that may become uninhabitable
makes ecology less a question of superior metaphysical force than an
increasingly credible cause]{.underline}. Tooze concludes: "[Let us look
for every chance for 'diplomatic encounters]{.underline}.' [But [let us
reckon with the pervasive force of the emergency that our
instruments]{.mark} so clearly [register]{.mark} and let us [not ignore
complementary action]{.mark}" in the realm of traditional
politics]{.underline}

### Link---DOD

#### The DOD technologizes war and expands it across the globe while enabling it to [boomerang home]{.underline} in the form of [domestic repression]{.underline}.

Utrecht University, "Understanding the Battle for AI in Warfare through
the Practices of Assemblage: A Case Study of Project Maven", Section
6.3, CS)

[Examining the practices of antipolitics and reassembly in this context
reveal a new form for the Military-Technological Complex. Bridging the
divide between the material power of the DoD and social power of civil
society, a new breed of "defence-tech"]{.underline} companies like
Anduril have carved out a niche as bespoke contractors. Having drawn
engineering talent from both traditional defence companies and Silicon
Valley, they exclusively but [openly court defence contracts, invoking a
discourse of patriotism without risking the alienation of a wider
consumer market]{.underline}. [The ease and speed]{.underline} with
which they began providing this work [speaks to the significant power of
the DoD and, in turn, the resilience of the Military-Technological
Complex as an assemblage. Underlying this entire process is]{.underline}
a constant tension between [the predominantly compulsory power of the
DoD and the predominantly productive power of civil
society]{.underline}. Sizeable contracts provide a compelling material
incentive for many tech companies to provide the technologies sought by
the DoD, but are in conflict with the ethical pitfalls publicised by
civil society. In some ways, each mimics the other. As [the DoD has
adopted a discourse of patriotism to assuage ethical concerns, civil
society has underlined the material risk to businesses with large
consumer markets seen to be enabling these developments in
warfare.]{.underline} As a result[, the civil-military industrial divide
appears more porous than ever, raising valuable questions about
contemporary warfare.]{.underline} Project Maven exemplifies a certain
fluidity, in that its [technologies were originally developed for the
consumer market, weaponised by the DoD for drone footage analysis, and
are now being "re-legitimised" through their transfer back into the
civilian sphere for humanitarian and public health
purposes]{.underline}. [Such a process arguably reflects a late-modern -
or liquid modern - blurring of the boundaries between war and peace,
military and civilian]{.underline}, public and private. [A blurring
civil-military distinction]{.underline} in this regard [must be
understood]{.underline} in the context of a geographically and
[temporally expanding militarism observed in the rise of "unending" and
"everywhere" wars]{.underline}. Similarly, in Graham's conceptualisation
of the "battlespace" of cities, he observes it ["has no front and no
back and no start or end... the concept... thus works by collapsing
convention al military-civilian binaries]{.underline}." Common to these
suggestions that conventional ties between war, space and time are
coming undone, however, is a focus on their practice. [The ascendancy of
the Military-Technological Complex suggests that the nebulous expansion
of warfare across space and time not only pertains to how it is
practiced but also how its means are developed and
procured]{.underline}. It is not a stretch to suggest that [this
expansion]{.underline}, in turn, [risks normalising new imaginations of
violence. And given that "violence needs to be imagined in order to be
carried out," one wonders where this normalisation may
lead.]{.underline} Conceptualising the Military-Technological Complex as
an assemblage is particularly appropriate in the context of liquid
modernity. [Absent of rigid, 'arboretic' structures, it takes
shape]{.underline} in a manner consistent with Bauman's interpretation
of sociality, ["spreading rhizomically and sprouting formations of
varying degree of durability, but invariably unstable, hotly contested
and devoid of foundation to rely on."]{.underline} [Fluidity of
formation and re-formation]{.underline} in this regard, however, [should
be regarded as "a feature of state power, not a bug." Instead of the
state standing separately to the private sphere, it is intimately
embedded within it and continually reproducing its power through
it.]{.underline} Lastly, directly relevant to this "undoing" of
conventional warfare and fluidity of the military-civilian divide is
[Foucualt's 'boomerang', which suggests the practices - and
technologies - of peripheral subjugation inevitably return to the
centre. Or]{.underline}, as Marx suggested, the scenario of "[war
\[being\] developed earlier than peace."]{.underline} Indeed, many have
noted the ways in which [the United States' war on terror has already
"come home to roost" in the form of widespread surveillance and
militarised police forces. One]{.underline} of the most overt and
egregious [examples can be seen in the recent use of an MQ-9 Predator
drone for surveilling Black Lives Matter protests in
Minneapolis]{.underline}. It is not known whether this drone was
utilising the technologies developed in Project Maven. But nor is it
hard to imagine.

### Link---Hacking

#### Hacking is a corporate tool used to control social realities -- it's intrinsic nature to the cybernetic system means the alternative is the only option 

**Burkart 19** (Patrick Burkart, Asistant professor in the Department of
Communication @ Texas A&M, "Why Hackers Win: Power and Distribution in
the Network Society", University of California Press, 2019,

// EL

Contemporary geopolitics are in flux as their norms shift and institu-
tions realign. Information increasingly is employed as both hard and
soft power in struggles that cross the social and technical boundaries
of long-standing networks. These struggles are central to what we term
the "Network Society."1 Why Hackers Win: Power and Disruption in the
Network Society examines the pressures that have driven global law and
policy into ambiguous territory. While many popular and scholarly
accounts posit hacking as a means to wobble the trajectory of late capi-
talism, we argue the inverse is true. [Hacking (offensively through
exploits and defensively through cybersecurity) extends and deepens
state and corporate proclivities to control social
realities.]{.underline} We define "hacking" as unauthorized trespass,
breach, or bypass of "trusted sys- tems" for purposes of surveillance
and potential theft, manipulation, or destruction of information.2
[These systems are based on communica- tion networks in which service
providers and users must be authenti- cated to access goods and
services. Therefore, user trust in their secu- rity and reliability is
essential.]{.underline}3 We focus on the hacking of trusted
systems---and not other kinds of readily accessible systems---because
the template for their protection has been refined in key areas of law,
technology, and society. [We posit hacking as a generalized symbolic
medium, like power and money, which can be collected and mobilized to
influence communica- tion systems. In the process hacking affords
opportunities to bypass exist- ing law and policy through
force.]{.underline} Our purpose in Why Hackers Win is to examine hacking
as a corporate and state strategy for managing risk. Ulrich Beck claims
that "being at risk is the way of being and ruling in the world of
modernity; being at global risk is the human condition at the beginning
of the twenty-first century" (2006, 330). Given the immense complexity
of the Network Society, state and corporate actors seek greater
self-awareness and certainty. Hacking enables these actors to seek out
their blind spots in online boundaries and activities. This knowl- edge
is valuable for maintaining systems and exposing risks. Hacking
(offensively through exploits or defensively through cybersecurity)
reflects common social impulses to survey, to measure, to model, and to
predict. While hacking often is viewed as essentially disruptive to
social structures, we argue the inverse is true. States and corporations
seek to maintain their standing and seek competitive advantage through
hacking campaigns. The creation of markets for exploits and
cybersecurity also affords new opportunities to develop and exchange
commodities. Conse- quently, to preserve national-security prerogatives
and develop global markets for hacking technologies, states have
resisted legal regimes to contain hacking by institutions---even as they
have enacted draconian laws against hacking by individuals. We find that
hacking and cybersecurity reinforce and accelerate each other in trusted
systems. While ostensibly antagonistic, both increasingly share a common
grounding in intellectual property. For hackers the value of hacking
victims, or "data subjects," is not so much in their personally
identifiable information, which is gathered and com- modified by trusted
systems. Instead, hackers exploit the "intellectual property" that
gathers and commodifies this information within these systems to squeeze
revenues through phishing and fraud. A secondary value is that hacking
provides data for valuing insurance products and refining cybersecurity
products already in use. In turn, cybersecurity offers possibilities for
developing intellectual property in the military and civilian sectors,
particularly in software and services. Both private security firms and
state military and police forces claim to have evolved cybersecurity and
cyber warfare into a "science," in which knowledge and expertise are
increasingly institutionalized in higher education and corporate
management. Both markets and militaries view offensive hacking
techniques (intrusion software like malware and botnets) and defensive
countermeasures as new opportunities to generate power and money and
manage risk. Much like the "dual-use" nature of exploits themselves and
consist- ent with other domains in the Network Society, the boundaries
between private and public are blurred and indeterminate. In the
neoliberal era the economic system has assumed more and more
responsibility for allocating risk through the market function of
pricing, and the state has turned more areas of social welfare over to
markets in an elaborated process of risk management and deregulation.4
Similarly, states increas- ingly outsource both hacking and
cybersecurity as a means of manag- ing risk. Internet service providers
perform state surveillance by proxy, and states (including the United
States) frequently employ independent spyware and hacking firms to
supplement their operations. Innovations such as insurance against
corporate hacking and identity theft also reflect the commodification of
hacking risks. When these responsibili- ties are outsourced to the
market, risks are distributed in patterns that can reinforce social
inequalities. The economy provides markets for risk management, but
"with the economic exploitation of the risks it sets free, industrial
society produces the hazards and the political potential of the risk
society" (Beck 1992b, 23). [Through all these means hacking represents
an interface between technical code (the structure of trusted systems),
legal code (the laws that govern their access and use), and social code
(their impact on soci- ety, particularly in terms of privacy and
sanctioned activity]{.underline}). As a grow- ing portion of the global
economy is based in digital trusted systems, we find a proportional
growth in the vulnerabilities inherent to these systems: the buggy
software, the unprotected account access, and the availability of
personally identifying information to others on the inter- net.
[Although hacking ostensibly undermines their own security, corpo-
rations and states paradoxically use hacking for gain.]{.underline}
Hacking can suit a broad spectrum of purposes, including gathering
intelligence, managing crises, and accumulating competitive advantages
over rivals. Some "exfiltration" hacks have successfully stolen data
such as business plans, while some failed episodes have landed spies in
jail (Landau 2013). The "hack-back," an attempt by victims of
cyberattacks to get into the hack- er's computer, can try to ascertain
the fallout from the initial breach, as well as knowledge about any new
schemes and risks of future breaches. While examining abuses of power
through computer vulnerabilities and exploits, we have not found "master
conspiracies" of surveillance and espionage, or even a systematic
imposition of will, in coordinated hack- ing campaigns. Instead, we see
a proliferation of agents contributing to offenses and defenses played
in long games and embedded in global net- works. In our view hacking has
become a mundane, "business as usual" application of force for many
enterprises. [The development of hacking and cybersecurity together also
fore- grounds paradoxes for social systems. Hacking is now integrated
into state and corporate activities, especially where business or
security interests are invested in maintaining trusted systems.
Organizations may hack for advantages over rivals by exploiting
vulnerabilities in trusted systems. At the same time organizations may
hack their own trusted systems or invite others to hack them (sometimes
called penetration testing or "pen testing") for purposes of
cybersecurity]{.underline}. "Red Team v. Blue Team" exercises take pen
testing to active warfare levels--- one team trying to break in while
the other defends. (In cybersecurity gospel "Red team ALWAYS wins
eventually. Blue just holds on as long as they can.") "Red teaming" is
embraced and institutionalized by the U.S. Department of Defense, where
"in the cyber world, offense and defense stemmed from the same tools and
techniques" (Kaplan 2016, 260). In all these scenarios hacking activity
provides recursive knowledge about trusted systems and the communication
systems in which they are embedded. In turn, these reflexive processes
can exercise coercive force in these systems. Whether or not they
encounter defenses, an exploit delivered through the right attack vector
can contribute to cybernetic feedback loops within systems. These loops
appear to be generated with increasing frequency, as hacking campaigns
(or cyberat- tacks) proliferate together with mass data breaches. [Our
approach to technology foregrounds the role of human agents and
institutions in communication. We argue that technologies are socially
constructed rather than deterministic and autonomous. Not- withstanding
the impact of technological change on the economy and society, even our
most powerful technologies do not operate independ- ently of human
controls such as market exchange, law, policy, and cul- tural
norms.]{.underline} Why Hackers Win takes a sociological perspective on
hack- ing, viewing it as one of many activities that constitute
communication in social systems. [If we view the cybernetic arena as a
social system, hacking serves to differentiate the components of this
system, which then adapts accordingly. The system as a whole is
reconfigured, with consequences for political, economic, and legal
systems, among others. Hacking and its codependent, cybersecurity,
therefore contribute to encoding communication in social systems rather
than undermining them]{.underline}. This idea is informed by Jürgen
Habermas's (1984, 1987) theory of communicative action and his dualistic
"system and lifeworld" analysis of modern societies. Accordingly,
hacking is related to digital piracy as a means of cultural reproduction
(Burkart 2011, 2014). In the absence of a tightly regulated market for
cybersecurity and component exploits, hacking has greater freedom to
"steer" interactions between states, markets, and laws. If the legal
system were to suppress the proliferation of commercial hacking tools
and spyware, the risks perpetuated by cyber insecurity might improve.
But the legal system is not designed to do this; in fact, it contributes
to systemic risk by enabling legal or gray markets for vulnerabilities.
We argue that the conjoining of intellectual property and cyber defense
in copyright law and policy adds additional levels of risk for society
as a whole. [**This is in part because hacking and data breaches are not
just episodic bugs; rather, they are routine and institutionalized
features of the system.** The growth of cybersecurity software and
related industries also impact these institutions and rou- tines,
contributing social effects in the process.]{.underline} Although
social-technical systems for media, business and finance, and defense
are increasingly globalized, the nation-state still provides the basis
for law and policy governing hacking. But the coherence and continuity
of law and policy within nation-states can fall on a contin- uum from
anarchic to totalitarian. Hacking therefore illustrates "gov- ernance in
areas of limited statehood" (Risse 2013). The relative depend- ence or
independence of hacking on law and policy can turn on a variety of
factors. Why Hackers Win addresses cases where new laws on hacking have
conflicted with both received policy traditions and emer- gent policy
regimes and where hacking still occupies legal gray areas. Judicial
review is not fully incorporated into many decision-making processes;
broad categories of hacking remain the privilege of the state and
therefore are exempted from the rule of law. Even hacking by pri- vate
firms may be absolved by the state (such as when telecommunica- tions
carriers received retroactive immunity from illegal wiretapping
violations).5 Secrecy and self-regulation are the rule for states and
firms, with little concern for values and norms for personal privacy.
Numerous national and international legal systems have categorized
piracy and hacking as cybercrimes, which has intertwined their history
and led us to consider them as distinct but related aspects of
communica- tive social action. As with piracy, the conflicts surrounding
trusted sys- tems center on issues of ownership and control, based on
the right to share private property or exclude others from access. It
remains as unlikely today as it did in 2006, when we wrote Digital Music
Wars, that a universal standard for digital-rights management will be
adopted by even a single industry. But the reprising of
digital-rights--management models for managing cybersecurity risks and
the securitization of intellectual property in military cybersecurity
policy suggest that guidelines for ntellectual-property theft will
dominate discourse over how to define and prioritize cyber threats. [We
also anticipate that enterprises depend- ent on trusted systems will
employ technology practices, legal activities, and political lobbying to
strengthen pecuniary rights at the expense of the public good. However
unjust they may be, "consumption norms" already have gelled for trusted
systems---along with their bases in sur- veillance and intellectual
property]{.underline} (Burkart 2010, 2014). In the aggregate of digital
dirty tricks and the attack vectors that enable them, we find an
unfolding, alternative history of technological development and its
impact on society. We conclude our study with a reflection on the overt
and covert applications of hacking and cybersecurity by states and cor-
porations and the importance of research and activist groups in drawing
attention to these activities. Without their efforts the question of who
is responsible for guarding the public interest in the Network Society
seems to answer itself: no one. The development of hacking and its dou-
ble star, cybersecurity, offers another example of how ostensibly
resistant technologies and practices may be contained, controlled, and
repurposed to suit the instrumental purposes of state and corporate
power.

#### Hacking is integral to digital capitalism -- corporations lie to achieve surveillance

growth hacks The extent of corporate espionage (or "corporate
intelligence") through hacking is unknown, although Fortune 500
companies use it to maintain defenses against IP theft (Bailey 2016).19
As a byproduct of "digital capitalism" (Schiller 2000), hacking markets
flourish at numerous levels (Burkart and McCourt 2017). In addition to
markets for exploits and packaged cyber-defense tools, other "growth
areas" include insurance against corporate hacking and identity theft
(whether these insurance products add or reduce risk is another
question). Markets for risk can diminish trust in social and
sociotechnical systems, resulting in what Jürgen Habermas (1975) terms a
"legitimation crisis." Although attempts to offload risk have worked for
now, we can already see how legitimation problems in cybercrime law and
policy are converging with escalating social risk toward catastrophe. As
Ulrich Beck proposes, ["risk is not synonymous with catastrophe. Risk
means the anticipation of the catastrophe. Risks concern the possibility
of future occurrences and developments; they make present a state of the
world that does not (yet) exist. Whereas every catastrophe is spatially,
temporally and socially determined, the anticipation of catastrophe
lacks any spatiotemporal or social concreteness"]{.underline} (2009, 9).
We address the institutional shaping of social norms in the next
chapter. [Three cases, in which transnational corporations hacked
trusted systems to engage in deceptive and anticompetitive behavior,
illustrate the way in which "growth hacks"---a Silicon Valley euphemism
"that describes breaking legal or moral rules in a quest for
scale]{.underline}" (Roberts 2017)---have migrated from start-up culture
to big business. We distinguish growth hacks from "deep hacks" (see
chapter 2), which can emanate from outside the marketplace and which
reverberate through the systems of technology, law, and society. [The
first example of a growth hack involves Uber Technologies, which
secretly built the Greyball and Hell software tools into its drivers'
smartphone app, enabling the company to operate in markets where its
services had been restricted.]{.underline} Uber's Android rider app
"phoned home" to send sensitive user data back to the company
(Khandelwal 2014). [News Corporation (News Corp) hacked voice-mail
accounts and intercepted private communications to generate
sensationalized stories for its News of the World tabloid
newspaper---which it then tried to cover up. Finally, Volkswagen's
software hack was created to mask excessive emissions by their diesel
vehicles, in clear violation of environmental protection rules in the
United]{.underline} States and abroad, even as the company sued
researchers who had discovered a way to hack its vehicle's locks. [These
examples illustrate the ways in which corporations have relied on hacks
of trusted systems as a standard business tactic while sometimes using
antihacking law to slow discovery of vulnerabilities in their own
systems]{.underline}.20 Uber has a particular "reputation for
ruthlessness" (Estes 2017). Its business model, based on a
trusted-system software platform shared by drivers and users, uses
real-time surveillance to match rides more efficiently than taxicabs. To
expand into areas where its operations were prohibited, in 2014 the
company surreptitiously added the Greyball function to its smartphone
app for riders. Greyball allowed Uber to identify and evade potential
authorities through practices such as "geofencing," in which a digital
map would locate city government offices and enable drivers to avoid
riders from those areas. Besides deceiving regulators, Greyball also
allowed Uber to survey social media and mine credit card databases to
identify and flag potential government or police employees (Isaac 2017,
A1). Another module on the driver app, known by Uber executives and
engineers as "Hell," allowed the company "to track drivers using its
biggest competitor in the US, Lyft, and to monitor which of Lyft's
drivers also drove for Uber" (Cook and Price 2017). The Hell and
Greyball programs exploited the surveillance features of smartphones on
both sides of its platform---driver and rider---to seek anticompetitive
advantage in labor markets for drivers and to evade government
regulations. Although these deceptive growth hacks contributed to Uber's
business plan by adding scale to its overall market, they also added to
a growing list of legal problems (including sexual harassment and
antilabor practices) attributed to Uber's former management. As of this
writing, the company is under investigation by the U.S. Department of
Justice for Greyball and by the FBI for both the Greyball and Hell
initiatives. But Uber remains "unrepentant." The firm's response to
getting caught deploying Greyball was to denigrate the public
investigators and law enforcement who caught them, while at the same
time implying that Uber was entitled to pursue hacking its employees'
and customers' phones as a proprietary business strategy. It employed a
classic hacking rationale to protect its trusted system (its private
property) from trespass (theft): "This program denies ride requests to
users who are violating our terms of service, whether that's people
aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our
operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret 'stings'
meant to entrap drivers," an Uber spokesperson stated (Estes 2017). Uber
was itself breached, as evidenced in May 2014, when two sellers on the
anonymous Tor network offered thousands of Uber usernames and passwords
that would allow buyers to log in and book rides (Gibbs 2015b). Uber
first issued a denial, but in November 2017 the company admitted that it
had hidden the breach, in which fifty-seven million driver and rider
accounts were stolen from a third-party server, for over a year. After
paying a \$100,000 ransom, Uber tracked down the hackers and pushed them
to sign nondisclosure agreements forbidding them to tell regulators or
users that the information was stolen. The company then concealed the
ransom by calling it a "bug bounty," in which hackers are hired to test
the security of systems (Isaac, Benner, and Frenkel 2017, B1; Larson
2017b). Yet, as the New York Times noted, "The issue is not legally
clear cut. Laws concerning bug bounties are ambiguous. The Justice
Department weighed into bug disclosure programs for the first time in
July and largely left it to organizations to decide what access they
will authorize for hackers and what they can do with the data. . . .
Breach disclosure laws also differ state to state. The state laws most
relevant to Uber's case require disclosure if names are exposed in with
driver's license numbers in a 'breach of security'" (Perlroth and Isaac
2018, A1).21 At News Corp illicit hacking teams appear to have operated
regularly under the direction of its board of directors and
subsidiaries, depending on the business needs of the day. To bolster
readership of News Corp's well-known tabloids, its journalists have
turned to innovative means of gathering information, including
brute-force password hacking of voice-mail boxes to access and delete
messages. One voicemail box belonged to a teenage UK girl at the center
of a missing person's case, who was later discovered murdered; others
belonged to victims of 9/11. A former News of the World employee (Paul
McMullan, deputy features editor) offered a wildly bent rationale for
his team's illegal phone hacking. He claimed that surveillance and
privacy violations are necessary to acquire exclusive sources for any
story: "Phone hacking is a perfectly acceptable tool, given the
sacrifices we make, if all we're trying to do is get to the truth. . . .
Privacy is for pedos" (qtd. in Lyall 2011). By 2017 News Corp's
newspapers had settled with more than a thousand phone-hacking victims
(Ruddick 2017). That same year News Corp's News Group apologized in
court to a former British intelligence official whose computer had been
infected with eBlaster spyware by a "private investigations" firm
operating under News Group's direction (2017a). The legal record
strongly suggests that hacking for business advantage is normal
operation in News Corp's TV distribution division as well. Although the
company claims to have disproved all allegations of illegal hacks, their
extensive computer hacking, including that in the service of "predatory
piracy" (Sauer and Tepper 2008), has been traced to roughly 1997. Four
separate lawsuits, accusing News Corp firms of hacking copy-protection
schemes, revealed a News Corp team dedicated specifically to developing
such "black ops" in support of its DirecTV operations. Following a 2011
shareholder action against the company, a court found News Corp's
subsidiary NDS guilty of hacking Vivendi and Echostar TV smart cards and
recruiting hackers to distribute counterfeit NagraStar cards to pirate
Dish Network signals, beginning in 1997. Specifically, NDS "was accused
by satellite company EchoStar of illegally extracting software code from
competitors' cards and posting the information online, allowing hackers
to create counterfeit cards that could be used to intercept television
programming. A federal jury found that NDS's practices were illegal and
the court subsequently granted EchoStar an injunction preventing NDS
from intercepting its satellite signal" (Pilkington 2011). NDS won on
appeal to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court in 2010 and eventually collected
\$18 million from EchoStar. But in the testimony a witness claimed to
have been paid more than \$20,000 in cash concealed in CD and DVD
players from HarperCollins (a News Corp division) to "develop a pirating
program to make DirecTV more secure, not to sabotage rival systems"
(Zetter 2008). Researchers have noted that News Corp's News America
Marketing division "has been the subject of five lawsuits alleging
anti-competitive behavior . . . \[forcing\] the company to pay out more
than \$650 million in settlements to three competitors" (Longstreth and
Hals 2011). One suit involving a competitor, Floorgraphics, claimed that
"on at least eleven separate occasions between October 2003 and January
2004, News intentionally, knowingly and without authorization breached
FGI's secure computer system and repeatedly accessed, viewed, took and
obtained \[Floorgraphics'\] most sensitive and private information
concerning its past and upcoming advertising and marketing programs"
(Edwards 2009).22 News America Marketing settled the lawsuit by
purchasing Floorgraphics' contracts midtrial, before the company had
finished presenting its case. The claims involving News Corp cluster
around breaches of trusted systems, for corporate espionage (theft of
intellectual property), hacking news makers and public officials, and
circumventing digital-rights management (conditional access controls for
competitors' satellite TV channels). Their pattern begins with News
Corp--owned (or majority-owned) companies instigating hacks against
competitors, continues with defensive litigation, and typically resolves
with a corporate takeover, settlement, or (in the case of News of the
World) restructuring.23 As UK regulators evaluate the Murdoch dynasty as
"fit and proper" in News Corp's bid for total ownership of Sky (Sweney
2017), its hacking victims have undermined News Corp's claims that its
standards and practices are, to use British military parlance,
tickety-boo. Volkswagen's software hack enabled cars marketed as "clean
diesel" vehicles to "pass" emissions tests despite dirty exhausts, and
its discovery triggered international regulatory reforms for car
emissions. Installed inside the car, Volkswagen's defeat device informed
the emissions-testing computer when a testing cycle was activated and
changed the vehicle's emissions accordingly. Researchers at West
Virginia University discovered cars with hacked chips emitted pollutants
almost forty times what was allowed by U.S. regulations (Glinton 2015).
After pleading guilty to federal fraud and conspiracy charges,
Volkswagen paid \$15 billion in fines for software installed in cars
made from 2009 to 2015 (McCarthy 2017). It also agreed to compensate
individual owners and repair all affected models. An engineer pled
guilty to participating in the scheme and was sentenced to a forty-month
prison sentence in 2016. New York and Massachusetts attorneys general
have pursued a civil case against Volkswagen, claiming that "this was a
widespread conspiracy involving many, many people," including the
company's CEO, who resigned when the scandal went public (Isidore 2016).
At the time of this writing, German authorities arrested and held the
CEO of Volkswagen's Audi branch for over three months in an ongoing
criminal investigation into emissions-test cheating. With the discovery
of its "defeat devices," Volkswagen found itself on the wrong side of
its own hack. But Volkswagen was not charged with creating and deploying
defeat devices; it was instead charged with conspiracy to defraud the
United States and its customers and to violate the Clean Air Act.
However, two years prior to the emissions-hack revelations, Volkswagen
sued Flavio Garcia, a computer science security researcher at the
University of Birmingham (and his team), to prevent disclosure of a
vulnerability in the antitheft system of some Volkswagen vehicles,
including high-end sports cars. In this case Volkswagen asked the UK
government to censor research findings that the wireless autoignition
system was easily hackable by thieves or others with criminal intent.
The lawsuit prevented Garcia and his team from presenting their findings
at the USENIX Security Conference in Washington, DC, in August 2013
(Trotman 2013).24 Publication of the research (Garcia, Verdult, and Ege
2013) was delayed two years by the suit but was soon followed by a new
paper, whose findings were even more serious (Garcia et al. 2016):
"Volkswagen left not only its ignition vulnerable but the keyless entry
system that unlocks the vehicle's doors, too. And this time, they say,
the flaw applies to practically every car Volkswagen has sold since
1995." These cars numbered about a hundred million units. With
Volkswagen's security system disclosed as a potential attack vector, the
company faces extensive recalls and repairs and possibly other large
expenditures related to the vulnerability (although none are reported at
the time of this writing). The hack used a cheap, off-the-shelf
microcomputer kit (called an Arduino). The suit against the Birmingham
researchers raised concerns that the company may have known about the
security vulnerability for years. The chip manufacturer that served
Volkswagen and other companies noted that VW's chip uses "a legacy
security algorithm, introduced 18 years ago. . . . Our customers are
aware" (Greenberg 2016). The UK court's 2013 order against Flavio
Garcia's team quashed the news of the vulnerabilities and placed an
embargo on their publication. The ruling reduced VW's short-term
financial risk in the conflict but potentially increased security risks
to the public through vulnerabilities that were known but unfixed for at
least two years. These three cases of corporate "growth hacks" are known
through their failures; we must ask how many other cases --successful or
not--- have gone undiscovered and unreported. Each company has offered a
unique response to its resulting public-relations nightmare. Volkswagen
launched advertisements titled, "Keeping Your Promises" with the
tagline, "It's more than just a car. It's keeping your promises" (Slater
2016), a campaign seemingly designed to exploit audience ignorance or
shortterm memory loss. News Corp's Rupert Murdoch (sort of) apologized
to the family of the dead thirteen-year-old girl whose voice mail was
hacked: "As the founder of the company, I was appalled to find out what
happened" ("Murdoch Begins" 2011). Uber claimed to have deployed
Greyball in charity, "because it was 'deeply concerned that its
driverpartners would be penalized financially' or otherwise for their
driving" ("Uber Faces" 2017). [The cases of Uber, News Corp, and
Volkswagen share a corporate realpolitik: turnabout is fair play when
hacking is part of corporate strategy. Hack your customers, your
employees, your competitors, your regulators, and, if expeditious,
retaliate if you're hacked. Deny, disclaim, or even cover up as needed,
and offer a counternarrative for plausible deniability. Use antihacking
law to your advantage if others find bugs in your trusted
systems]{.underline}. None of these cases demonstrates negligence as
clearly as they demonstrate hubristic anticompetitiveness. As giant
corporations caught abusing trust, their growth hacks add social risk,
complexity, and extra layers of secrecy and suspicion to the economy,
politics, and the law. They signify the impetus to manipulate trusted
systems, a form of "soft power," to compete for advantage. A hacker's
successful exploit of a trusted system is not the sort of news willingly
shared by a company whose reputation and business depends on that
system. News of hacking cases bubbles up from industry trade magazines,
hacker forums, security email listservs, and other sources removed from
the business pages of newspapers and magazines. [Hacking tools and
techniques allow states and corporations to manipulate sociotechnical
systems for advantage, sometimes illegally through outright fraud but
more commonly through legal "gray zones."]{.underline} Nurtured by legal
fictions, aporias, and other vagaries, hacking can blur the boundaries
between military and corporate intelligence programs, between national
and international legal systems, and between corporations and clients.
Hacking can catalyze changes in multiple domains and across related
subsystems, often in a "cascading" fashion that can escalate the scale
of their effects (Landau 2013, 160). Since interconnected networks
increasingly are essential to the state's political and economic
functions, they are considered to be among the state's strategic defense
interests. Yet national legal regimes are riddled with inconsistencies
that reduce their effectiveness in coordinating social systems and may
even exacerbate social risks of hacking.

### Link---Humanitarianism

#### Thinking is over. Hello calculation. The [global computational turn]{.underline} renders the affs attempts to retract international imperialism a farce of [modern technocapitalism]{.underline}. Empire no longer operates through traditional statecraft or \<insert affs mechanism\> but rather through the ontopolitics of [adaptive design]{.underline}, a recourse to remote management and interconnected digitized finance as a means of simultaneously eliminating and recreating precarity. This design principle is the [zeitgeist of late modernity]{.underline} and makes global interventions and security crises inevitable.

**Duffield 19** (Mark Duffield is Professor Emeritus and former Director
of the Global Insecurities Centre, University of Bristol, and an
Honorary Professor at the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute,

The War on Terror imposed limitations. Compared to the 1970s and 1980s,
humanitarian agencies found their political room for manoeuvre
significantly restricted (BOND, 2003). At the same time, despite agency
growth and extensive efforts to professionalise relief work, there was
little commensurate increase in effectiveness (Fiori et al., 2016).
Growing risk aversion and [**[recourse to]{.mark}** **[remote
management]{.mark}**]{.underline}, moreover, **[[created problems of
distancing]{.underline}]{.mark}** and loss of familiarity (Healy and
Tiller, 2014). Distracted by debt-fuelled uncertainty, rather than an
indignant citizenry, [Western publics now present as so many
disillusioned, ironic spectators]{.underline} (Chouliaraki, 2013).
Diplomatic influence has also declined (Mair, 2013). [While NGOs lay
claim to a 'nongovernmental' status, [direct action thrived
when]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[donor sovereignty]{.underline}**]{.mark}
was, paradoxically**, still [[able to cast a
shadow]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Given the refugee crisis, few can today
contemplate the wretched state of 'official' humanitarianism without
some disquiet]{.underline}. Despite what we may wish or demand, however,
it is unlikely that significant improvement will occur any time soon.
But to then conclude that humanitarianism is dead would be a mistake.
While [autonomous international direct action lies buried in the rubble
of the West's urbicidal wars]{.underline}, [a]{.underline} new
optimistic, less direct but [[technologically updated humanitarianism
has confidently stepped forth]{.underline}]{.mark}. More de-risked and
requiring less professional expertise than the labour-intensive direct
engagement of the past[[, it is a cheaper Western humanitarianism
designed for connectivity rather than circulation]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Often called humanitarian innovation (ALNAP, 2009; Betts and Bloom,
2014), a feature of **[[this new humanitarianism is its enthusiastic
embrace of adaptive design]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Ramalingam et al.,
2014; HPG, 2018). Moreover, unlike autonomous direct action, which
reached its peak in the late 1980s**[, humanitarian innovation [sits
comfortably with private partners and corporate
sponsorship]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Zyck and Kent, 2014),
[**[a]{.underline}**]{.mark} [necessary]{.underline} **[[recalibration

**[[the seamless penetration of commercial information and communication
technologies]{.underline}, [software platforms]{.underline}, [automating
apps and screen interfaces into all aspects of personal, social,
national and international life]{.underline}]{.mark}** tout court.
**[[Humanitarian innovation is politically safe, logoed, glitzy and
smart]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Besides establishment acceptance,
[humanitarian innovation draws positivity from its disavowal of past
failures and commitment to a future of 'failing-forward in a spirit of
honesty]{.underline}' (HPG, 2018: 132). Transparency regarding current
systemic 'pathologies' like **[institutionalising
selfinterest]{.underline}** or neglecting the agency of the
disaster-affected (ibid.: 22--3[) **is part of the self-cleansing
necessary to birth a humanitarianism**]{.underline} 2.0.
[This]{.underline} [paper]{.underline}, however, [questions]{.underline}
whether [humanitarian innovation can be any more effective than the past
relief efforts it now disavows]{.underline}. [Rather than system
failure, just as important is that the world has change]{.underline}d.
Societies are more fragmented and unequal than before (Piketty, 2014).
[International space has striated into fast, slow and stopped
lanes]{.underline} (Brown, 2010) [as debt, precarity and anger have
flourished]{.underline} (Mishra, 2017[). **[Rather than correcting past
mistakes, humanitarian innovation is embarked on]{.mark} a wholly
different project**]{.underline}. **[It is [helping create the systems
and structures to govern global precarity]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Important]{.underline}]{.mark} here [[is its privileging of the
design principle over]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [need for]{.underline},
or even **[the possibility of, [political change]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Design Not Politics **[[The computational turn and societal dependence
on digital technologies has changed the way the world is understood and
the status of humans within it]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Chandler, 2018).
[The privileging of the design principle is central to this
change]{.underline}. **[[Besides the spatial shift from circulation to
connectivity]{.underline}, [an ontological,
epistemological]{.underline}]{.mark} [and methodological [translation
has also taken place]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Duffield, 2018). While
anticipating late-modernity, the spirit of 1970s direct [humanitarian
action was fabricated from a deductive process of knowledge formation
framed by narratives of history, causation and reciprocity]{.underline}.
[[Reflecting the rise to dominance of a cybernetic
episteme]{.underline}, **[this register has been replaced by a reliance
on inductive mathematical data and machine-thinking for
sense-making]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Rouvroy, 2012). **[[Thinking has
been transformed into calculation]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Han, 2013).1
[The current dominance within the academy of empiricism and behaviourism
reflects this change in world-experience]{.underline}. What is often
called [post-humanism]{.underline} (Braidotti, 2013) [brings several
contemporary positivist stands together]{.underline}. These include the
new empiricism, speculative realism and actor network theory.
[Posthumanist thought draws on process-oriented behavioural ontologies
of becoming]{.underline}. These privilege [individuals understood as
cognitively limited]{.underline} [by their unmediated relationship with
their enfolding environments]{.underline} (Galloway, 2013; Chandler,
2015**). [[An individual's 'world' reduces to the immediate who, where
and when of their changing network connections and
disconnections]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The overlap here with
neoliberalism's necessarily ignorant subject is returned to below.
Importantly, [the pure factuality of [**a post-humanist existence casts
doubts on the distinction between a lived reality and a wider world**,
**a distinction that is central to knowledge and the narrative of
history**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **Without this separation [there is no
space]{.underline}**, as it were, **[for a political commons of
contrasting life-chances]{.underline}, [contestation and critique that
is essential if we are to successfully share the world with
Others]{.underline}**. In its absence, as Bruno Latour approvingly
argues, the whole becomes smaller than the sum of its parts (Latour et
al., 2012[[). **Rather than a shared world of circulation, we have the
endless personalised and separate worlds of
connectivity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Post-humanism problematises the
possibility of a shared or collective politics. Indeed, Latour (Latour,
2008) goes further in suggesting that **[[design has]{.mark} now
[replaced politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Building on his earlier
rejection of grand narratives and critique (Latour, 2004), Latour claims
that [since encountering the scale of the ecological crisis, we are all
now designers rather than modernisers]{.underline}. Across a wide arc of
operational discourse, [[empathetic design attitudes
reflect]{.underline}]{.mark}ing such feminine [sentiments as
'attachment, precaution, entanglement, [dependence and care']{.mark}
have all but replaced earlier]{.underline}, [more masculine Promethean
commitments to 'emancipation, detachment, modernization, progress and
mastery']{.underline} (Latour, 2008: 2). [**[In place of political
change]{.mark}**, **[Latour asserts the primacy of a conservative

the need to accept and work with the world as is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[-- rather than how it ought to be]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[In

resistance]{.underline} (Han, 2010). **[[The excessive positivity of
adaptive design, its endless willingness to happily fail-forward into
the future]{.underline}, [suits the economic logic of
late-capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.2 To draw this out, it is
necessary to first review the latter's greatest achievement. **[[Global
Precarity A characteristic of late-modernity]{.mark}, at least [in
relation to the global North]{.mark}]{.underline}**,3 is what Nikolas
Rose has called the 'death of the social' (Rose, 1996). [This demise is
usually equated with the roll-back of the welfare state.]{.underline}
Originally meant as a collective insurance-based shield against market
forces, [since the 1980s the welfare state has been residualised through
means-testing, privatisation, cuts and the politics of
austerity]{.underline}. Companies and businesses, however, have also
shed their former social-democratic responsibilities (Boltanski and
Chiapello, 2005). Jobs for life, intergenerational career structures,
apprenticeships, subsidised canteens, social clubs, sports facilities
and company pensions have disappeared. In the mid twentieth century, for
the white working class at least, welfarism together with a Fordist
employment culture provided a high degree of protection against market
forces. Indeed, this was a defining political feature of the West's
racial- and gender-inflected Cold War socialdemocratic settlement
(Streeck, 2017). [Over the last two or three decades, driven by the
neoliberalism of the conservative counter-revolution, this social
protection has largely evaporated]{.underline}. Insurance- and
company-based social protection has historically been limited or absent
in the global South. Late-modern precarity begins here first (Munck,
2013). Encouraged by the imposition of structural adjustment, [the
South's informal economies began to rapidly expand from the end the
1970s, absorbing the surplus population thrown off as public-sector
employment and services contracted]{.underline} (Cornia, 1987). Moving
to catch up, so to speak, by the 1990s a 'post-social' economy was
consolidating in the global North. While marked differences remain,
[**[the]{.underline} [North]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[South]{.underline} [have drawn together around the economic logic
of]{.underline} [precarity]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In the latter,
[fuelled by jobless growth, for several decades a selfreproducing
informal sector has been by far the largest employer and supplier of
goods and services]{.underline} (Meagher, 2016[). **[For the North,
precarity has taken the form of the disappearance of 'good' jobs as the
casualisation of work has increased]{.underline}**]{.mark}. This
includes the growth of insecure, poorly paid temporary work and marginal
forms of selfemployment (TUC, 2017). Wages have stagnated, and social
mobility stalled. Moreover, it is widely accepted that today's young no
longer enjoy the life chances of their parents (Corlett, 2017). Given
this downturn, [living the dream has meant a massive expansion of debt
financing]{.underline} (Streeck, 2017). [[The acceleration of economic
informality in the global South has been matched by the residualisation
of market protection in the North]{.mark}.]{.underline} As this
conjuncture suggests[, the greatest achievement of late-capitalism has
been to author an expanding post-social global precariat]{.underline}.
While progressive neoliberalism celebrates the exchange of 'nanny-state'
security for a contingent freedom to consume (Boltanski and Chiapello,
2005), latecapitalism is fraught with contradictions. Reversing a
hitherto world-historical trend, since the 'long boom' ended in the
1970s there has been a secular decline in the rate of profit. Every
recovery from the periodic business cycle has, from this period, been
feebler than the last (Brenner, 2006). Recovery from the 2008 financial
crisis, for example, has been the weakest and most prolonged on record
(Streeck, 2017). [Reflecting the realities of the downturn, the new
freedom to consume has, to a remarkable degree, been unequally
distributed]{.underline} (OECD, 2008; Oxfam, 2016). [Precarity is a
by-product of the long downturn]{.underline}. It emerges at that
historic moment when the economy becomes a site of permanent emergency
(Streeck, 2011). A human surplus coexists with the 'jobless' growth
resulting from the systemic urge to deepen automation at a time of
declining profitability (Smith, 2017[). **[Within a post-social world,
risk and security have been individuated]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Compared to the normative welfare systems of the past[, **[a new
disaggregated and personalised biopolitics has
emerged]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [If biopolitical regimes could be
likened to animal species,]{.underline} [[the welfare state catered for
the herd]{.underline}]{.mark}. Today, it is the turn of the predator. 4
[[Rather than share risk, there is a new emphasis on individual
responsibility]{.mark}. [In the global North, the downturn has spawned a
narcissistic culture]{.mark} of bodily fitness, healthy lifestyles and
making good choices, [while **in the South, a post-humanitarian ethic
has disaggregated, medicalised and reduced precarity to the
basic**]{.mark} **nutritional, energy, health, sanitation, education,
financial and psychic [requirements needed to maintain bodily
functioning]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Jaspars, 2015). [Everywhere,
**resilience**, **or**]{.underline} **[[the injunction to endlessly
adapt before unmediated market and environmental forces]{.underline},
[has become the zeitgeist of late modernity]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Evans and Reid, 2014). [As the uncertainty of active unemployment
becomes the global work norm, the chronically poor and the
disaster-affected have blurred. In an unmediated relationship with their
environments, they are]{.underline} both [subject to permanent
emergency]{.underline}. [They constantly change place and, at a time
when economy and disaster have blurred, from a post-humanitarian
perspective, they become indistinguishable]{.underline}. Since
resilience is now equally required of the poor and exposed -- as well as
the 'first Post-Humanitarianism 17 Downloaded from

responders' -- the traditional distinction between developmental and
humanitarian relief has also lost its meaning. Disasters are
developmental; so development has been set the task of re-wilding a
post-social world. **[Within the economic logic of precarity, however,
the global South has a special place]{.underline}**. [Able to utilise
the relatively unregulated conditions existing there]{.underline}
(Hosein and Nyst, 2013), [[rather than eradicating poverty, **the role
of humanitarian innovation is to experiment, trial and anticipate the
means to govern an emerging global precariat**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Jacobsen, 2015). [In particular, the challenge is to sustain precarity
in the sub-prime conditions of the South by optimising its social
reproduction.]{.underline} Having devoured, since the 1970s, the last
areas of economic and institutional autonomy still outside of itself
(Sloterdijk, 2013), other than profitably recycle the precarity it now
produces in abundance, so to speak, late-capitalism has no other future.

4.1.1. Military-Technological Complex ["To overcome challenges to our
military superiority," declared the US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel
in 2014, "we must change the way we innovate, operate, and do
business."]{.underline} Noticing tides of change lapping at his feet,
Hagel recognised that new ways of war required new ways of business.
[From his perspective, the problem of AI in defence was one of access:
the technology existed, but was out of reach of the DoD. Cooperation
with new industrial partners would be essential to developing these new
technologies and, in turn, maintaining American military
superiority.]{.underline} To understand why the Department of Defense
needed to forge new alignments with industry, it helps to consider
previous practices of military research and development (R&D) and their
(un)suitability for purpose. In the post-WWII era, a "Military
Industrial Complex" emerged among the civilian industrial conglomerates
(e.g. Boeing and General Motors). Simultaneously, significant public
investments into military R&D boomed and led to several technologies now
commonplace in the civilian sphere, such as GPS. In [fact, this
cross-pollination of public funding and technological innovation between
the military and civilian spheres transformed Silicon Valley's from a
"landscape of fruit orchards into a hub of electronics production and
innovations."]{.underline} At the conclusion of the Cold War, the
Military-Industrial Complex lost its raison d'etre. Fifty-five billion
dollars of acquisitions and mergers followed, as many engineering
companies parted with their defence businesses, consolidating the
defence industry into five "titans." Concurrently, DoD procurement
practices became cumbersome and convoluted, resulting in \$46bn wasted
between 2001 and 2011 on weapons systems that never entered production.
Most acquisition programes took years or even decades to reach the
battlefield. Tightening belts and a slow production line blunted the
technical edge of the Military-Industrial Complex. Today, most R&D
investments are dominated by the private sector. By 2014, when Hagel
announced the Third Offset Strategy, it was clear that digital
technologies were the future of defence. As the leader of Project Maven
Jack Shanahan noted, "[the future battlespace is constructed of not only
ships, tanks, missiles, and satellites, but also algorithms, networks,
and sensor grids]{.underline}." Hagel obliquely referred to LAWS with
his warning that the US army "could one day go into battle confronting a
range of advanced technologies that limit our freedom of maneuver."
Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work, by contrast, was more explicit:
"10 years from now if the first person through a breach isn\'t a
fricking robot, shame on us" Moreover, the official DoD directive on
LAWS declared its intention to develop autonomous weapons with
"appropriate levels of human judgment" that would satisfy "the law of
war, applicable treaties, weapon system safety rules, and applicable
rules of engagement." [From this, it appears the problem was perceived
not in the technology itself but in developing it to a certain standard.
It could not do so alone. Technological innovation took centre stage in
the Third Offset Strategy but would require new actors, by Hagel's own
admission: "\[The\] DoD no longer has exclusive access to the most
cutting-edge technology or the ability to spur or control the
development of new technologies the way we once did. So we will actively
seek proposals from the private sector... those firms and academic
institutions outside DoD's traditional orbit."]{.underline} Technology
companies, by contrast, were not as public in their intentions of
working with the DoD. Despite Silicon Valley's government-funded roots,
its radically different working culture of "disruption" and willingness
to "fail fast, fail often" were institutionally alien to the DoD. Beyond
these normative issues, many technology companies regarded the Pentagon
as too small a customer to work with, especially given the bureaucracy
involved. Similarly, the huge sets of training data required to make
useful machine-learning algorithms are hard to come by for defence
purposes. Notably, well before Project Maven was even established,
Google was making significant inroads in robotics development but
appeared unwilling to work with the Pentagon, however it was unclear
whether this was driven by ideological or market considerations.
Nevertheless, it was clear that for many tech companies the problem was
perceived in a technical manner similar to the DoD: the issue was not
necessarily developing the technology but establishing the partnerships.

#### Innovation is unsustainable -- the DOD's pursual of the private industry and dismissal of technological expertise proves their sole intent is capitalist superiority

4.2.1. Military-Technological Complex From the Third Offset Strategy, AI
technologies were clearly considered imperative to maintaining American
military strength. [Incapable of mandating cooperation between private
industry and the military, however, the DoD had to rely on persuasion
rather than coercion to acquire the technologies it sought.]{.underline}
[Accordingly, the "solution" for the DoD appeared to be becoming better
in building relationships with contractors. And so it began courting
tech companies with new contracting processes.]{.underline} In April
2015, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter delivered a speech at
Stanford University - the first visit to Silicon Valley from a Secretary
of Defense in twenty years. [Centred around innovation, the speech
culminated in the announcement of the Defense Innovation Unit
Experimental (DIUx). This new DoD body, located in Silicon Valley ("a
nexus of innovation"), would work to "strengthen existing relationships
and build new ones; help scout for new technologies; and help function
as a local interface for the department."]{.underline} In addition to
the DIUx, t[he Defense Innovation Advisory Board (DIB) was established
the following year. This collection of Silicon Valley luminaries,
chaired by Eric Schmidt (formerly of Alphabet Inc., the parent company
to Google), were assembled to provide the Pentagon access to "the
brightest technical minds focused on innovation."]{.underline} Drawing
industry voices like Schmidt into the assemblage suggested that with the
right expertise, the challenges of developing AI for defence could be
overcome. The role of the DIB in legitimising the DoD's endeavours in
this field will be elaborated in the following chapter: authorising
knowledge & managing failures. [Forging alignments with tech companies
accelerated dramatically in 2017 with the creation of the Algorithmic
Warfare Cross Functional Team (AWCFT). Better known as Project Maven,
the AWCFT sought "to accelerate DoD\'s integration of big data and
machine learning... to tum the enormous volume of data available to DoD
into actionable intelligence and insights at speed"]{.underline}
Specifically, its goal of automating the "Processing, Exploitation and
Dissemination \[PED\] for Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems" meant using
Machine Learning to automatically analyse drone footage for objects of
interest, freeing up human analysts for higher-level work. [It is
important to note that those leading Project Maven in the DoD were not
selected on the basis of technological expertise but their skill in
building relationships]{.underline}. Although the role of Google was not
public at this early stage, a public "industry day" hosted by the DoD in
October 2017 was attended by more than 300 industry and academic
partners - a clear sign of DoD enthusiasm for forging alignments with
the tech industry. Beyond the concrete goals of Maven, it had an
important underlying purpose as a "pathfinder" mission, the "spark that
kindles the flame front of artificial intelligence across the rest of
the \[Defense\] Department," according to its leader Lt. Gen. Jack
Shanahan. Its founding memo emphasised agility: "after successful
sprints in support of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR)
PED, the AWCFT will prioritize the integration of similar technologies
into other defense intelligence mission areas" (emphasis added). The
Pentagon was thus framing the solution as being to move faster and work
closer with industry in adopting and integrating algorithmic
technologies. For the DoD, then, just as the "problem" of integrating AI
technologies was a logistical one, the proposed solution was equally
practical. [Initiatives like the DIUx, DIB and Project Maven indicated
that with enough energy and skill, it could forge the necessary
alignments with tech companies to acquire these
technologies]{.underline}. Elements gathering around the problem of AI
in defence from this perspective were thus already crystallising as its
solution - closer cooperation.

2.2. Remote Warfare The best indication of warfare's near future can be
found in its recent past. With this in mind, LAWS can be contextualised
by the ascendancy of "remote warfare." Defined as "a strategy of
countering threats at a distance, without the deployment of large
military forces," remote warfare takes a variety of forms, including the
use of technological (e.g. drones) or physical (e.g. partner forces,
private military contractors) proxies. By considering remote warfare
from strategic-political and tactical-technological perspectives, LAWS
can be considered a natural continuation of technologically-enabled
warfighting among risk-averse Western states. [The technologies of
remote warfare - particularly drones - cannot be fully understood
without attending to the strategic and political impetus for their use.
"Stand-off" warfighting runs deeper than any single technology. At the
turn of the millennium, Ignatieff's analysis of the "Virtual War" in
Kosovo noted that Precision-Guided Munitions (PGMs) promised "speedy,
risk-free victory." Contemporaneously, others noted the ascendancy of of
"riskless x warfare" and "risk-transfer militarism" establishing a trend
towards the asymmetrical deployment of force in Western Military
operations.]{.underline} Patterns of risk-aversion among Western forces
observed at the turn of the millennium have since accelerated. A
combination of past failures, budgetary constraints, and increased
political and popular scrutiny mean Western militaries exercise even
greater caution in their troop deployments today. [Risk-aversion has not
precluded military engagement entirely, but has prompted states to
consider alternative means of projecting influence without committing
large ground forces]{.underline}. In his conceptualisation of "vicarious
warfare," Waldman therefore notes the pre-eminence of delegating force
(to proxies and partner forces) and danger-proofing personnel (through
airstrikes and remotely-piloted weapons systems) in contemporary
military interventions. [Delegation and danger-proofing respectively
constitute the social and material forms of mitigating risk to US
troops. Similar dynamics have been observed among other NATO members.
Put simply, the strategic appeal of remote warfare is perceived as
efficiency: risking less and achieving more. From a tactical
perspective, the efficiency engendered by remote warfare was made
possible by technological innovation]{.underline}. For this reason, a
burgeoning field of scholarship has emerged around the technologies of
remote warfare, particularly drones - "the most visible application of
the information age to contemporary warfare." Chamayou's seminal
treatise on Drone Theory takes an expansive look at the political,
ethical and legal implications of drone warfare, concluding that
"[remote war is a war of human machines against the human body... one
side loses people; the other side loses toys."]{.underline} While this
analysis does consider the human impact of this technology, it remains
overwhelmingly focused on the drone itself. [Some argue this
"fetishisation" of drone technologies (predominantly by military actors
but also in academia) mystifies their human relations. Myopic focus on
technologies alone thus risks presenting a false image of "war without
bodies."]{.underline} Scholars of remote warfare are not alone in their
tendency to perceive technology deterministically. Despite the
centrality of technology to IR, its study too-often assumes it is either
entirely controlled by humans or distinctly separate from human agency.
In line with Latour's concept of the Black Box, ["technical work is made
invisible by its own success," leaving us unaware of its broader
significance. As Flusser quipped, however, "technology has become too
serious a matter to be left to technicians." There is thus a need to
apprehend the complex socio-technical systems that produce and are
served by technologies.]{.underline} Or, as Hoijtink and Leese invite,
to "render them political" and consider "the politics that go into
technology, as well as the politics that emanate from technology." [In
such socio-technical systems, accounting for the interaction of humans,
technologies and structures invites analysis of how agency and power may
be produced, distributed and transformed.]{.underline}

### Link---Security Cooperation

#### Security cooperation misses the point. War is transitioning -- now operates through the computational redisclosure of the battlefield and predictive preemptive systems

What [this reach]{.underline} grasps [is the "datified
subject]{.underline}" (Cheney-Lippold 2017, 35), that is to say, [the
identity constituted for individuals by their activity on digital
networks]{.underline}. This is not to suggest an entire virtual
translation of the person into the network but rather t[he collection of
digital identifiers that converge on]{.underline}, add to, overlay,
interpenetrate, [and]{.underline}, in some contexts, [supplant the
multiple social codes and indicators of which corporeal individuality is
composed]{.underline}. There is now an extensive literature on the
various corporate and state "profiling machines" (Elmer 2004) that
assemble and ascribe identities from the traces of digital searching,
liking, browsing, shopping, chatting, and navigating, and, indeed, from
the mere act of carrying location-transmitting mobile phones. And there
is a similar series of investigations into the "[black
boxes]{.underline}" (Pasquale 2015; see also Amoore 2013; Finn 2017) [of
algorithmic processes]{.underline} that, from the accumulation of "big
data," predict future activities---and of the many biases and errors
that enter this process (O'Neill 2016). [This literature highlights the
paradox that the mass volumes of big data enable increasingly precise,
personalized mapping of an individualized "data subject]{.underline}"
(Bauman et al. 2014) according to its conformity or deviation from a
series of patterns. [We will follow this idea through three different
registers in which war touches the "datified subject": battlefield
intelligence, civilian surveillance, and digital
propaganda]{.underline}, focusing particularly on examples from the
United States. Shawn Powers and Michael Jablonski (2015, 81) observe
that origins of data profiling lie in intelligence operations, where
mosaic theory, the idea that "[one can piece discrete bits of
information together to predict the likely intentions or actions of
others]{.underline}," has been a core idea. Early in the so-called war
on terror, mosaic theory was applied at the CIA's black sites and U.S.
military's detention centers at Guantánamo, Bagram, and Kandahar, where
captives were often held and interrogated solely on the basis of
association with other suspects (Pozen 2005). The idea that [big data
can generate an "individualization" of war has become increasingly
prominent in cyberwar doctrine]{.underline}. In 2014, Charles Dunlap, a
retired U.S. major general (and one of the several authors who invoke
the pseudoTrotsky aphorism we started with), [suggested that
anticipations of cyberwar as a series of "apocalyptic" infrastructure
attacks might be less important than the "hyperpersonalization of war"
based on data profiles]{.underline}. [The possibility that particularly
excited him was that of targeting specific members of an opponent's
forces, "primarily the leadership cadre but also critical technicians
and experts," with the primary example being the use of
drones]{.underline}, [both for information gathering and attack delivery
from the skies over Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, and
Somalia.]{.underline}

### Link---Undersea Cables

#### Their threat toward undersea cable systems is exaggerated and a form of fearmongering 

**Bueger 21** (Christian Bueger, Professor of International Relations at
the University of Copenhagen, "Protecting hidden infrastructure: The
security politics of the global submarine data cable network",
*Contemporary Security Policy*, 3/29/21,

// EL

Cable security and the problem of threat inflation While the control and
security of submarine communication infrastructure were a core issue and
part of the security calculations during the two World Wars as well as
the Cold War (Hills, 2002; Smith, 2018), in the post-Cold War
environment such concerns were less prevalent. The uncontested U.S.
naval hegemony and the primacy of non-state threats moved such issues to
the margins. The new discourse on the protection of critical
infrastructures influenced by the concerns over transnational terrorism
of the 2000s did not change this substantially. It is only in the early
2010s, that scholars such as Sechrist (2012), Ross (2014), or Martinage
(2015) called attention to the security of the submarine cable network.
Since then, a number of studies have documented the relevance of cables
for national and international security. [Anchored in the wider
geopolitical, strategic, and military discourses of the North Atlantic
security community, contributors are concerned about the rise of hybrid
warfare, the perceived hostility of Russia's foreign policy, the fear of
a large-scale cyber-attack, and the growing technical sophistication of
terrorist groups. The focus of such studies is hence the vulnerability
of the cable network emanating from deliberate attacks. Observations of
Russian submarine activities in territorial waters and in proximity to
cable routes, that became public in 2015, triggered much of this
debate]{.underline} (Hicks et al., 2016, pp. 3--4). [This raised
concerns that the Russian navy might tap into the cables for espionage
and surveillance, temper with or even cut them as part of a hybrid
warfare campaign]{.underline}. Schaub et al. (2017, p. 37) stress that
"cables and nodes would be prime targets in a hybrid warfare campaign"
instigated by Russia. A former Supreme Allied Commander at the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) suggests that this seems obvious, as
"in the case of heightened tensions, access to the underwater cable
system represents a rich trove of intelligence, a potential major
disruption to an enemy's economy and a symbolic chest thump for the
Russian Navy" (Stavridis, 2016). Similarly, a report by the British
think tank Policy Exchange emphasizes that "whether from terrorist
activity or an increasingly bellicose Russian naval presence, the threat
of these vulnerabilities being exploited is growing" (Sunak, 2017, p.
5). Others suggest that undersea cables are inherently susceptible to
attacks from non-state violent groups and terrorism, since their
location is usually public, cables tend to be highly concentrated
geographically and the level of technical expertise and resources
required to damage them are limited (Martinage, 2015; Matis, 2012;
Sunak, 2017). These studies are supplemented by governmental reports
that examine and assess threats to the undersea cable network. NATO's
military leadership for instance warned that the Russian navy is
threatening the undersea cable network (Birnbaum, 2017). It is,
nevertheless, not clear whether NATO believes Russia has the capability
or the intention of attacking cable networks (Hinck, 2017). [In order to
mitigate the threats to the undersea cable network, above studies
situate cable security in the context of national security strategies
and call for a military response. Increased naval patrols, surveillance
activities and other measures of deterrence are the proposed
responses]{.underline} (Martinage, 2015; Matis, 2012; Sunak, 2017).
Other proposals concern national focal points, public-private
coordination and the creation of cable protection zones (Davenport,
2015; Martinage, 2015; Schaub et al., 2017; Sunak, 2017). [However,
neither scholars nor public officials have provided much detailed
information about the substance of a Russian or terrorist threat to the
cable infrastructure.]{.underline} Hinck (2017), for instance, diagnoses
a general lack of information regarding any threats to the undersea
cable network, particularly when it comes to the alleged Russian
intentions, plans and activities[. So far, no intentional hostile
disruptions to the submarine cable infrastructure have been reported
publicly. The scenarios underpinning the threat discourse hence seem to
be built not on prior incidents but on overall assessments of the
geopolitical landscape. Arguably, this implies that the threat scenarios
could be exaggerated and point to a substantial risk of threat inflation
and fearmongering.]{.underline}

### Impact---Algorithmic Warfare

#### Algorithmic warfare expands [mass techno-inflicted violence]{.underline} across the [globe]{.underline} and risks [nuclear extinction]{.underline}.

**Johnson, 18**---Professor, Environmental History, Loyola University
Chicago (Benjamin, "Coded Conflict: Algorithmic and Drone Warfare in US
Security Strategy," Journal of Military and Strategic Studies, Volume
18, Issue 4, dml)

[The notion that people can be killed]{.underline}
'**[incorrectly]{.underline}**' represents the dominant concern in
military appropriation of civilian technologies and [replicates the same
troubling issue]{.underline} that is [identified by post-colonial
critiques of drone warfare]{.underline}: [that implicitly there is
a]{.underline} '**[correct]{.underline}**' [and]{.underline} therefor
[**ethical** way to kill people at all]{.underline}. However,
[even]{.underline} the post-colonial focus on how surveillance and kill
targets are 'Othered' and the violence encountered through [that process
is only part of a **larger set** of issues raised by]{.underline} the
focus on **[algorithmic warfare]{.underline}**. [Given that security
discourse is beginning to re-emphasize]{.underline} the importance of
long-term [**interstate competition** and a security strategy predicated
on]{.underline} information-decision cycle dominance through
**[algorithmic superiority]{.underline}**, [the implications posed go
**beyond** the violence of surveillance and killing]{.underline}.

For one, [the **increasing militarization of everyday life** supports
the **normalization** of drones and weapons]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} in turn [**legitimates** their use in regimes of
violence]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} in and of itself [is not a
**departure** from the liberal way of war but a **strengthening** of its
underlying rationality]{.underline} -- [that peace must be secured
through force]{.underline}.

Second, while the focus has also been on the role of algorithms in
shaping autonomous weapons without the perceived ethics of a human
consciousness (which itself is a problematic position), [the
implications of algorithmic decision making go **much farther** than
autonomous weapons]{.underline}. The most recent [security strategy
rhetoric]{.underline}, which defines its adversarial advantage in terms
of decision-making cycles, [shares a **similar** but **amplified** form
of the game-theoretic rationality that underpinned]{.underline} Cold-War
thinking under the rubric of 'mutually assured destruction'
(**[MAD]{.underline}**). However, [unlike MAD]{.underline}, [which
theoretically maintained a balance of power]{.underline} (however
uncomfortable) between the US and USSR, [the new logic of **decision
cycle advantage** has been combined with an equal shift
towards]{.underline} a rhetorical need for [weapons that exist **below
the threshold** of non-use]{.underline} (whether because of their
destructive capability or cost). While the National Defense Strategy
states an overall strategy of interaction "below the level of armed
conflict,"131 [there is a **troubling scenario** presented when decision
making is **theoretically collapsed** into the instantaneous without
humans necessarily]{.underline} '**[in the loop]{.underline}**.'132
[Combined with a rhetorical stance that has emphasized a need for **new
weapons** and a **modernized nuclear arsenal** with]{.underline}
'**[small-yield]{.underline}**' [warheads]{.underline}, which are argued
to introduce a measure of 'limit' and tactical capability within US
nuclear deterrence,133 [the **expansion** and **normalization** of
algorithmic violence seems a **likely future**]{.underline} for
societies **[across the globe]{.underline}**. Dillon and Reid have
already alluded to the possibilities encountered in this environment.
They argue that:

[**endless war** is]{.underline} underwritten here by a new set of
problems \[because\] these wars no longer benefit from the possibility
of scoring outright victory, retreating, or achieving a lasting
negotiated peace by means of political compromise. Indeed, deprived of
the prospect of defining enmity in advance, war itself becomes [just as
**complex**]{.underline}, **[dynamic]{.underline}**, [**adaptive** and
**radically interconnected** as the world of which it is
part]{.underline}. That is why '[any such war to end war becomes a **war
without end**]{.underline} \[\...\].134

This is not to suggest that the future looks like the totalitarian and
apocalyptic scenarios of fiction. However, the 'unending' and
'everywhere' war does imply, following Focault's interest in the
continuation of war once peace has been declared, that [the spatial and
temporal parameters of conflict are increasingly escaping **even the
foggiest notion** that peace and war are inseparable]{.underline}. Shaw
has argued that failing to conceive of artificial intelligence in terms
of its behavioural agency (which is implicitly limited to humans) fails
to consider how **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [and robots will **transform** the global
political order **independent of their instrumental use**]{.underline}
by.135 At its most seemingly innocuous end in terms of the spectrum of
possibilities encountered, the set of issues posed suggest that [war and
security will increasingly become a **routinized**]{.underline},
[**normalized** and]{.underline} indeed **[biopolitical]{.underline}**
in terms of its [structure for **even the smallest processes** of
everyday life]{.underline} across multiple spaces. At the other end of
this spectrum towards the seemingly impossible nightmare scenarios
encountered in fiction, [algorithmic warfare is posed to extend the
liberal rationality of]{.underline} '**[peace through
force]{.underline}**' [into the realm of **totalitarianism** and the
threat of **mass techno-inflicted violence** across the
**globe**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

The notion that war is now 'never-ending' has a two-fold dimension. The
first is that in order to retain advantage over one's opponents, one
must be continuously adapting and innovating, especially as those
opponents are able to play 'catch-up' at an increasing speed. The second
dimension is that, as a consequence of the first dimension, [the
life-worlds of individuals and societies will be **increasingly
subjugated** to a particular militarized and securitized logic of
adaptation and innovation]{.underline}, [such that **human life itself
risks being lost** to **totalitarian governance** or even **total
destruction**]{.underline}. This of course is a dramatization of the
latent possibilities in a 'permanent' and 'everywhere' war. However, as
a great deal of research has shown, [these latent possibilities are
**already actual realities** for an **increasing number** of people
across the globe]{.underline}. Thus, [the potential consequences of
these dramatic possibilities **should not be discounted**]{.underline}.

As a brief summary of the expansive discussion made above, this article
has argued that drone and algorithmic warfare are an expression of and
an indivisible tool for the 'never-ending' war that is now propelling US
security strategy rhetoric. These technologies and the never-ending war
itself are not 'new' in the sense that there is a clean break between
the conflicts of yesterday and today. However, modern warfare is not the
same either. Rather, these technologies and the rationalities that
underpin them are part of a much larger set of practices that are
historically rooted with linkages to the Cold War, the World Wars, and
even to the Napoleonic Wars, but have increasingly penetrated the lives
of everyone in new and complex ways. In this respect, [drone and
algorithmic warfare represent a **particular configuration** of a
simultaneous evolution in technological capability and an **acute
faith** in that capability to mitigate the risks of
uncertainty]{.underline}, which paradoxically appear to be increasing as
a result of globalized networks. Fukuyama's 'end of history' it seems
gave birth to the very conditions that are undermining its own
stability. While the policies and technologies associated with
counter-terrorism have formed and will undoubtedly continue to form a
major part of this security environment, [the return of]{.underline}
'**[great power competition]{.underline}**' [entails **much wider
implications** stemming from an intensified focus on distance and
autonomy]{.underline}. If the recent US security strategy is to serve as
an indicator for where history will go, [it will be a race to not only
**decide more** than the]{.underline} '**[Other]{.underline}**', whoever
that may be, [but to **know**]{.underline}, [**decide**
and]{.underline}, if necessary, **[strike faster]{.underline}** -- to
essentially collapse the spectrum of domains and dominate a singular
domain of space-time. [To accomplish this may require a **totalizing
endeavor** not dissimilar to]{.underline} the complete and total
mobilization of society needed to wage the World Wars, the culmination
of **[total war]{.underline}**. However, unlike the blurring of the
civilian and military spheres along with the mass mobilization of labour
and industrial capacity, [total war in the]{.underline}
'**[never-ending]{.underline}**' [sense implies that it will happen in
the **networks** and **minutia of everyday life**]{.underline}, perhaps
**[without us even knowing it]{.underline}**.

These [companies' collaborations with the U.S. security apparatus
include their acquiescence to the NSA PRISM surveillance
program]{.underline}, an episode they are now energetically attempting
to live down. It also includes [their lucrative provision of services to
U.S. military and intelligence agencies, ranging from massive data
storage and processing facilities (Amazon and Google) to space-based
"geospatial visualization services" (Google) to "wearable tech" for the
armed services (Apple) as well as surveillance systems for the private
military contractors that now constitute the sizable penumbra of
Pentagon operations]{.underline} (Alexander 2015; Gregg 2017; Levine
2014a, 2014b).[8 [This reciprocity also involves the "revolving door"
between high-level Silicon Valley and Pentagon managers and their shared
culture of global "problem-solving" think tanks]{.mark}, typified by
Google's Jigsaw, and a willingness to censor internet material at the
behest of the U.S. government, once only sporadically disclosed but now
in full swing after the 2016 election hacking scandal]{.underline}
(Assange 2014; Levine 2014c; Greenwald 2017b). Yet the United States has
cyberwar vulnerabilities. Paradoxically, these result from its
historically advantageous "home game" (Segal 2016; 35) advantage: a
highly networked military and economy susceptible to hacker attack. This
problem is intensified by the neoliberal form of capitalism the United
States champions. Free market zealotry is at once governmentally
embraced and on occasion makes it difficult for the U.S. state to
enforce cybersecurity provisions on private capital, around issues
ranging from the reporting of cyberattacks to mobile phone encryption[.
**[It is largely in reaction to U.S. strengths and weaknesses that
Russia and China have developed their own capacities and
strategies]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In particular, rather than seeing
cyberwar as a distinct sphere of military operations, it is for these
nations' military forces subsumed within a larger category of
"information warfare" that comprehends forms of psychological operations
and propaganda. This orientation, taken together with the different
historic levels and paths of technological development, has led to
distinctive approaches to conflict in cyberspace.

The People's Republic of [China]{.underline} (PRC) was until recently
[the main object of popular U.S. cyberwar anxieties:]{.underline}
[depictions of transpacific wars fought with digital weapons abound in
both fictional entertainments and serious political
scenarios]{.underline} (Singer and Cole 2015; McCoy 2017). Yet although
China['s digital policies and practices have been presented in the most
ominous terms in U.S. media, they may be as much a sign of weakness as
of strength]{.underline} (Lindsay 2014; Lindsay, Cheung, and Reveron
2015). An important factor driving the leaders of the Chinese Communist
Party to open their country to the world market at the end of the 1970s
was the perception of massive and intensifying technological
backwardness vis-à-vis the West. As the PRC confronts the question of
whether, in the global market, it will be an economic "head servant"
(Hung 2009) to the United States or risk conflict over issues of trade
and political dominance in the Pacific, this awareness shapes China's
concept of cyberwar. [Thus, for the Chinese state, a major concern is,
notoriously, maintenance of ideological control over a population
perceived as vulnerable to terrorism, to separatism, and to "foreign
influences" of the sort projected by U.S. digital "soft
power]{.underline}." This control is exercised through the elaborate and
continually evolving apparatus of digital censorship, surveillance, and
preemption shorthanded as the "Great Firewall of China." This system
combines blackouts of proscribed websites, algorithmic filtering and
monitoring of email, and interventions by internet militias (the
so-called Fifty Cent Army, named for the alleged pay rate for each
posting) or bureaucrats to divert or disrupt controversial discussions
with pro-government cheerleading with digital surveillance of, and
attacks on, overseas sites and groups attempting to evade censorship
(Lindsay, Cheung, and Reveron 2015; Klimburg 2017). Administered via the
collaboration of private-sector internet service providers with state
authorities, the system has been characterized by a changing, erratic
enforcement that by its very uncertainty increases the risk to
dissenters. The Firewall, which has undoubtedly contributed to China's
unenviable record of large-scale imprisonment of social activists and
journalists, has been a frequent target of Western criticisms for
violations of internet freedom, though these have subsided somewhat
post-Snowden. China's possible larger plans for an extensive "social
credit" system based on monitoring of internet practices and "scoring"
of social and perhaps political behavior would represent the logical
consolidation of this system (Economist 2016a).

The overlap between issues of hard and soft power in a cyberwar context
is demonstrated by what Bratton (2016, 112) terms [the "Sino-Google
war]{.underline}." Between 2002 and 2010, Google was involved in
protracted and complex disputes with the PRC over that state's internet
censorship. These intensified when, in 2006, Google set up a Google
China subsidiary, headquartered in Beijing. [After oscillating between
compliance and noncompliance, and having suffered highly sophisticated
hacking attacks, which the NSA offered to help counter]{.underline}
(Levine 2014b), [Google China closed its mainland office in 2010 and,
though it continued operating from Hong Kong, now holds only a tiny
share of China's search activity. **This episode can be interpreted in
several ways: as a clash between internet freedom and authoritarianism
(the version favored by Western politicians, internet pundits, and
media**]{.underline}**); [as an intercapitalist [dispute between Google
and China's]{.mark} major domestic, and state-championed, search
enterprise, Baidu; or, as Bratton describes it, as [a collision between
rival concepts of the internet's relation to the state]{.mark}, [one
giving the former primacy over the latter, the other reversing that
priority]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Although there is something to be said for all these perspectives, they
overlook the one [Bratton explicitly rejects: "superpower"
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet the period of the "Sino-Google war"
was one of mounting tensions between the United States and China,
including the unfolding aftermath of China's earlier capture of a U.S.
spy plane (Hersh 2010); American accusations of large-scale digital
espionage, both economic and military, by Chinese hackers (Segal 2016);
NSA "implants" in the networks of China's giant telecommunications
company (Hsu 2014); and widespread expectations that Sino-American
tensions could trigger the first full-scale cyberwar (expectations still
widely held, even if Russia has lately publicly supplanted China as an
object of U.S. suspicions). In this context, it is hardly surprising
that the issue of a giant U.S. internet company not only skirting
China's Great Firewall but also amassing massive information about
China's data subjects, and establishing itself as gateway to global
networks, was extraordinarily tense.9

### Impact---Dark Pure War

#### The expansion of war beyond physicality enables [dark pure war]{.underline} against the [planet]{.underline}.

**Towns, 19**---associate professor in Communication and Media Studies,
Carleton University (Armond, "(Dark) Pure War: Virilio, the Cinematic,
and the Racial," Media Theory, Vol. 3, No. 2, 145-160, dml)

In Pure War, Paul Virilio argued that [[war continued **beyond**]{.mark}
the physicality of [the battlefield]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Outside of
the violence of the **fight** lay a violence of **industrial
production** toward the **conditions** for war]{.underline}. Put
differently, [[**pure war** signified]{.mark} the new ways that war was
now acted out]{.underline} '[[in **infinite
preparation**]{.underline}']{.mark} (Virilio, 2008: 29). Pure war
indicated the always already active preparation for war by the state,
even when war was not being physically waged.

One could say that a cornerstone of Virilio's research has been media's
relation to unending war. [[A **central component**]{.mark} of pure
war]{.underline}, for example, [[is
**info**]{.mark}**rmation**]{.underline}, or [the **gathering of data**
to surveil and police populations that are always under the watchful eye
of the war machine]{.underline}. Interestingly, Virilio concerns himself
less with the racial implications of those who are open to surveilling
and policing and more with the expansion of policing and surveilling as
practices that are applicable to 'everyone'. Yet, his examples of war
have racial undertones that he often does not fully investigate: the
Vietnam War, the Iraq War, and the Italo-Ethiopian War, to name a few,
all creep toward the pure war. Even as Virilio (2002) acknowledged the
racial implications of the Second World War, he had less to say about
the recognition that the Nazis pulled their racialized strategies of
death for the European Jewish population from the US state's approach to
black and indigenous people (Whitman, 2017). Each of these wars, between
white and nonwhite people or between white and white people in relation
to those who could never fully be white, suggest that the wars that
Virilio found most interesting were not race neutral.

What can Virilio provide for a media studies of race? I argue that
Virilio's work on [[pure war can be reinterpreted
as]{.underline}]{.mark} a '**[[dark]{.underline}]{.mark}** pure war',
[concerned with [a **militaristic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[**unending
war** against nonwhite populations]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is a dark
pure war, one that structures the colony and the metropole, that lays
the foundation for pure war. [[**Dark pure war** is]{.underline}]{.mark}
not necessarily 'black' in the racialized sense, even as it often
functions that way. Instead, it is black in the
'**[[blackening]{.underline}]{.mark}**' sense, [in]{.underline} what
Kumi Silva (2010) calls [the]{.underline} '[identification]{.underline}'
[of nonwhite bodies as open to state violence]{.underline}. Thus,
pulling from Virilio and Simone Browne's (2015) Dark Matters, a [dark
pure war outlines the **centrality** of race to the continuance of
war]{.underline}, even as race is the purposefully forgotten genesis of
such war. [This is **[not]{.mark}**]{.underline} Michel Foucault's
(2003) '**[[race war]{.underline}]{.mark}**', as Europe is not the
central locale from which such war occurs. Rather, [[dark pure war is
**inseparable** from]{.mark} **Euro-American
[imperial]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[capitalistic
expansionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([[**colonialism** and **racial
slavery**]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[as **militarized projects** toward the
**maintenance of white life** and the **conditions of black
death**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[ad infinitum]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Virilio's work has been called, rightly in my opinion, 'wild and
aphoristic' (Sharma, 2013). Yet, I want to say that what Virilio may
point toward is an investigation of the centrality of technologies to
racialization processes. Surveillance studies (which has long
investigated race) and media philosophy (which has been slower to
discuss race) are put into conversation with one another here. I advance
the concept of dark pure war in three sections. I start by delineating
the connections between war, cinema, and information that Virilio argued
were important. I then move into outlining the darkness of pure war,
particularly by outlining the racialized components of contemporary
policing and surveillance. I conclude by calling for a rethinking of
'dromology', one that moves toward including the multi-symbolic capacity
of 'race' in discussions of war.

The Perceptions of War: Vision and the Cinematic

In War and Cinema, Virilio argued that the history of war was both
theatrical and a history of transforming perceptual fields, whereby
vision was increasingly the site of power. As such, the rifle's
gunsights and the camera came together to situate the world as a field
of vision that could be measured, calculated, and shot. For Virilio,
film functioned as a pedagogical tool, one that involved an increasing
sensorial detachment from film itself. Virilio's example is the famous
myth of an audience in Paris watching a film of a moving locomotive
filling the screen causing the people in the cinema to believe the train
was going to drive over them:

\[In\] fact it was the precision of the camera-shot which first created
audience panic at the Lumières' 'motion demonstrations' of the train's
arrival at la Ciotat, when everyone felt that they risked being crushed
or injured by the train. This kind of fear, akin to the sense of speed
that people seek on roller coasters, did not disappear but simply became
more pernicious as the audience learnt to control its nervous reactions
and began to find death amusing (Virilio, 1989: 39-40).

What Virilio pointed to was a transformation in perception: film
produced images of objects, thus, perceptually distancing audiences from
said objects, to a point where there would no longer be a need to panic
at the sight of an oncoming train in a cinema. There have been a few
attempts to debunk the myth of whether or not the audience was actually
sent running at the sight of the train (Cooper, 2016; Grundhauser,
2016), but the fact still stands: 'film is now second nature to us, but
it was utterly shocking not much more than a century ago' (Cooper,
2016).

Cinemas were 'training camps', bonding 'people together in the face of
death agony, teaching them to master the fear of what they did not know
-- or rather, as Hitchcock put it, of what did not exist' (Virilio,
1989: 40). In short, cinema readied people for 'the artificial horizon
of a screen or a monitor capable of permanently displaying the
preponderance of the media perspective, the relief of the "tele-present"
event taking precedence over the three dimensions of the volume of the
objects or places here present' (Virilio, 2006: 66). This training did
not occur overnight, but involved multiple media forms that all worked
toward perceptual transformation. As such, more than cinema, Virilio is
interested in the 'cinematic', which included and exceeded cinema,
proper; he tried to track the link between cinema, war, and later
'vision machines', such as television, CCTV, smart devices, and drone
strikes, assuring us that 'Components of a cinematic machine have been
in use over many centuries: forms of projection, moving images, immobile
voyages, and visionary illuminations' (Crary, 2009: 13). The cinema,
television, and war all worked together toward distancing audiences from
objects, for Virilio.

Virilio's work on cinema also adds much to those interested in studying
the Web and information. [[In the wake of the **atom
bomb**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Virilio warned of]{.underline}]{.mark} a
second bomb, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} '**[[info]{.mark}rmation
[bomb]{.mark}]{.underline}**', which is important for pure war. [Whereas
[the atom bomb was]{.mark} a war of **[movement]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[the info]{.mark}rmation [bomb was]{.mark} a war of [**knowledge** and
**speed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, signifying a war 'won' by the increasing
speed of interactivity in real time. Such a bomb included and exceeded
cinema, and essentially structured computer screens and the Web -- both
media developed during and after the Second World War, and very much
because of it. This is a trajectory of transformations that cannot be
said to have origins in cinema, but were representative of the impact of
the cinematic:

We're still here in the domain of cinematic illusion, of the mirage of
information precipitated on the computer screen what is given is exactly
the information but not the sensation; it is the apatheia, this
scientific impassibility which makes it so that the more informed man is
the more the desert of the world expands around him, the more the
repetition of information (already known) upsets the stimuli of
observation, overtaking them automatically, not only in memory (interior
light) but first of all in the look, to the point that from now on it's
the speed of light itself which limits the reading of information and
the important thing in electronic information is no longer the storage
but the display (Virilio, 2009: 56).

For Virilio, then, the shift from 'tele-vision' to 'tele-surveillance'
reflected the demands of capitalism and war. Whereas tele-vision held
'the task of informing or entertaining the mass of viewers' (Virilio,
2006: 59), the new tele-vision, or the 'tele-surveillance', was
concerned with 'exposing and invading of individuals' domestic space,
like a new form of lighting, which is capable of revolutionizing the
notion of neighborhood unit, or of a building or district' (Virilio,
2006: 59). The drone strike, then, could pinpoint a 'target's' location,
whether indoors or outdoors.

Thus, tele-surveillance spoke to a 'dromology,' a 'speed politics', or a
politics of instantaneousness, sparked by [the]{.underline} increasing
[need to **entertain**]{.underline}, **[monitor]{.underline}**, [and
**prepare** others for their own monitoring]{.underline}. Further, [it
**replicated** the waging of **war** on people at a
distance]{.underline}: 'Making information resonate globally, which is
necessary [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the age of [[the]{.mark} **great
[planetary market]{.mark}**]{.underline}, is in many ways going to
resemble the practices and uses of military intelligence, and also
political propaganda and its excesses' (Virilio, 2006: 62). Likewise,
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} spoke to what many have called a '**[[slow
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**', one that [[**disproportionately
impacts** the **Global South**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Nixon, 2011;
Parikka, 2017), as a space largely viewed solely [[as a **waste
station** of the]{.mark} Global [North]{.mark}]{.underline}. [War is a
**continual process** that **does not end when the last round is
fired**]{.underline}, [but is also carried out via the **circulation of
information** and **propaganda** in ways that **penetrate**]{.underline}
architecture **[without]{.underline}** necessarily physically
**[destroying]{.underline}** a building's structural integrity.

Dark Pure War: Surveillance and the Racial

[Pure war is the continuance of war **after** the physicality of war is
over and done]{.underline}; now, [information functions toward the
continuance of war]{.underline}, [as a **preemptive strike** against
enemies]{.underline}: 'But **[[war doesn't really
end]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Virilio noted, **[[it just
accelerates]{.underline}]{.mark}**, approximating ever more closely to
its pure form' (Wark, 2018). [Information is now a **central component**
of war]{.underline}, whereby '[Not only is architecture **vulnerable**
to bombs]{.underline}, [it proves **defenseless** against
information]{.underline}, [passing through]{.underline} the doors and
walls of [our homes]{.underline}, [**rearranging** the space and time we
imagine we live within]{.underline}' (Wark, 2018). Indeed, 'the
capability of war without war manifests a parallel information market of
propaganda, illusion, dissimulation' (Der Derian, 2002: viii).

To rethink Virilio's pure war as dark pure war requires thinking about
not only how [information is **weaponized** toward war's
continuance]{.underline}, but also the presumed racial neutrality
associated with both war and information. Thus, [race is the
**underexamined**]{.underline}, [**overlooked** element]{.underline} of
Virilio's theory. Like discussions of dark matter in physics, Browne's
employment of '**[dark matter]{.underline}**' is meant to [point toward
the]{.underline} 'unseen and **[unperceived]{.underline}**' [elements of
antiblackness in]{.underline} the **[surveillant
practices]{.underline}** of contemporary society. She argues that
'[**rather** than seeing surveillance as something inaugurated by **new
technologies**]{.underline}, such as automated facial recognition or
unmanned autonomous vehicles (or drones)' (Browne, 2015: 8), [we can
instead think about]{.underline} '[[surveillance]{.mark} in and of black
life [as a **fact of blackness**]{.mark}]{.underline}' (Browne, 2015:
6). Thus, Browne connects surveillance theory to a dark history
concerned with the measurement of bodies to see their 'intentions', a
dark history often underexamined in surveillance studies. That history
is scientific racism:

Anthropometry, or Bertillonage, was introduced in 1883 by Alphonse
Bertillon as a system of measuring and then cataloguing the human body
by distinguishing one individual from another for the purposes of
identification, classification, and criminal forensics. This early
biometric information technology was put to work as a "scientific
method," alongside the pseudo-sciences of craniometry (the measurement
of the skull to assign criminality and intelligence to race and gender)
and phrenology (attributing mental abilities to the shape of the skull,
as the skull was believed to hold a brain made up of individual organs)
(Browne, 2015: 112).

What Browne points toward is a question unasked by Virilio: what if
[the]{.underline} '[fact of blackness]{.underline}' [[is the
**structuring necessity** for]{.mark} the new technologies of
surveillance]{.underline} themselves? This would require that we rethink
pure war as a dark pure war, which is to say that [pure war holds race
as **central**]{.underline}, [while **never acknowledging** its
importance to the **[maintenance of war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

What if we thought about Virilio's pure war as a racial condition in the
US? In short, what if we were to rearticulate WEB Du Bois' (1994)
question of, 'How does it feel to be a problem', as a racialized
question of war? The end of the US Civil War and [[the end
of]{.underline}]{.mark} racial [[slavery marked]{.mark} the structure of
[pure war as a **condition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[rather than]{.mark}
a **[contingency]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[of black
life]{.underline}]{.mark}. Another way to say this is that white people
went to war with each other over the right to own our black bodies in
the US Civil War, and it presumably ended in 1865. Yet, the replication
of racial violence, what Saidiya Hartman (2008) calls
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} '**[[afterlife of
slavery]{.underline}]{.mark}**', [[has **yet to end** for black
people]{.underline}]{.mark}; instead, [racial violence is
**fundamental** to what it means to be black]{.underline} ([and
white]{.underline}) in the US. [[Jim Crowism]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[ghettoization]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[deindustrialization]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[white
flight]{.underline},]{.mark} [[mass incarceration]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and gentrification are **remnants** of dark pure
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. They are post-war answers to how to deal with
a 'problem'; to call for their end is to call for the end to what many
cannot let go of: whiteness. Further, with race at its center, this
entails that [black people are not the only ones affected by dark pure
war]{.underline}, [but are part of dark pure war's larger
assemblage]{.underline}.

What Virilio pointed toward, then, was that cinema and war were
necessarily interconnected and assistants in the perceptual
transformations that readied populations for their own continual
surveillance; and just as important, [such forms of surveillance have
been [tested on people of color **prior** to]{.mark} their
implementation on [the **larger society**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
what Browne refers to as [the]{.underline} 'unseen and
[unperceived]{.underline}' [component of]{.underline} dark matter and
what I call [dark pure war]{.underline}: it [is the **necessity** of the
black body as an **always already surveillable**]{.underline},
**[commodified object]{.underline}**, one that can normalize even the
contemporary surveillance of people's information online.

### Impact---Dystopia

#### Dystopia outweighs everything.

**Harel and Brownsword, 19**---law professor at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem AND Professor in Law at King\'s College London (Alon and
Roger, "Law, liberty and technology: criminal justice in the context of
smart machines," International Journal of Law in Context, Volume 15,
Special Issue 2, June 2019, pp. 107-125, dml) \[language modifications
denoted by brackets\]

Famously, Stephen Hawking (2018, p. 188) remarked that 'the advent of
super-intelligent AI would be either the best or the worst thing ever to
happen to humanity'. At best, smart machines, smart policing and smart
cities of the kind contemplated by Elizabeth Joh might signal the end of
crime; but, at worst, [we can imagine **various dystopian futures**
where the **existential** and **agential threats** presented by AI have
been **realised**]{.underline}. [Given]{.underline}, in James Bridle\'s
(2018, p. 2) words, [that our [technologies are **complicit** in 'an
**out-of-control**]{.mark} economic [system that **immiserates
many**]{.mark} and continues to **widen the gap** between rich and poor;
[the **collapse of**]{.mark} **political** and **societal
[consensus]{.mark}** across the globe resulting in **increasing
[nationalisms]{.mark}**[, **social divisions**, **ethnic conflicts** and
**shadow wars**; and a **warming climate**, which **existentially
threatens us all**']{.mark}, then]{.underline} Vincent Chiao might well
be right in claiming that [the turn to smart technology **might not be
the**]{.underline} smartest [**\[best\] way** of trying to achieve the
**end of crime**]{.underline}.

In this collection, our contributors have not highlighted concerns of an
existential nature. Nevertheless, we might fear that, in our quest for
crime-free societies, for greater safety and well-being, [we [will
**develop** and **embed**]{.mark} **ever more [intelligent
devices]{.mark}** to the point that [there is a risk of the **extinction
of humans**]{.mark} -- [or]{.mark}]{.underline}, if not that, then [a
risk of humanity surviving 'in some **highly suboptimal state** or in
which a large portion of [our potential]{.mark} for desirable
development [is **irreversibly squandered**']{.mark}]{.underline}
(Bostrom, 2014, p. 281, note 1; see also Ford, 2015). Our contributors
have not yet recommended that we should follow the example of Samuel
Butler\'s Erewhonians who, fearful for their liberty, destroyed their
machines (Butler, 1872) -- and who also, of course, inverted
conventional wisdom by punishing those who fell ill while, by contrast,
treating in hospital and sympathising with those who committed crimes
such as forging cheques, setting property on fire or robbing with
violence. Yet, the beauty of Erewhon is that, to some present-day
readers -- particularly readers who are familiar with, say, Harari\'s
Homo Deus (2016) 15 or Häggerström\'s Here be Dragons (2016) -- the
practices of the Erewhonians might seem to be anything but benighted.
[Is it **so ridiculous** to think that, with the **acceleration in
technological development**, machines might become **much smaller** and
**smarter**, capable of **reproducing themselves**, **communicating**
with one another and displaying various degrees of
**intelligence**]{.underline} (if not consciousness as humans experience
it) [and **agency**?]{.underline} Most importantly, [which policy would
be the more]{.underline} crazy [\[imprudent\]: to **disregard** machines
as a threat to the human condition or to [treat the threat as
**sufficiently serious** to warrant]{.mark} at least some
**[precautionary measures]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- albeit perhaps not
precaution on the scale exercised by the Erewhonians, who destroyed 'all
the inventions that had been discovered for the preceding 271 years'
(Butler, 1872, p. 260)?

Such, however, are not [the **most explicit concerns**]{.underline} of
our contributors. Rather, the concerns expressed by Bowling and Iyer, by
Lynskey and by Macdonald, Correia and Watkin [relate to our **agential
interests** and]{.underline}, in particular to our interests [in
**privacy**]{.underline}, in [the **fair collection** and **processing**
of our personal data and in **access** to (and the **integrity** of) the
informational eco-system]{.underline}. Increasingly, it is being
recognised that [such interests are '**contextual**' not only in the
sense that their demands might **vary** from one context to another, but
in the **more fundamental sense** that we have a **common interest** in
a context that **enables our self-development**]{.underline} (Hu, 2017;
Brincker, 2017). This is nicely expressed in a paper (discussing data
governance) from the Royal Society and British Academy:

'[Future concerns will likely relate to the **freedom** and **capacity**
to create conditions in which we can **flourish** as individuals;
**governance** will determine the **social**, **political**, **legal**
and **moral infrastructure** that gives each person a **sphere of
protection** through which they can **explore who they are**, **with
whom they want to relate** and **how they want to understand
themselves**, free from **intrusion** or **limitation** of
choice]{.underline}.' (Royal Society and British Academy, 2016, p. 5)

[With data being gathered]{.underline}, in both the public and the
private sector, [on an **unprecedented scale**]{.underline}
(Vaidhyanathan, 2011; Galloway, 2017), [we might [treat]{.mark} such
[dataveillance as **compromising the conditions for**]{.mark}
**self-development** and **[agency]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Pasquale,
2015). Moreover, we might fear that, [where data are used to **train
[smart machines that]{.mark} sift** and **[sort
citizens]{.mark}**]{.underline} (as mooted by the Chinese social credit
system) (Chen and Cheung, 2017), then, in Glen Greenwald\'s (2014, p. 6)
words, [this [could be the **precursor** to a]{.mark} **truly
[dystopian]{.mark}** ['system of **omnipresent monitoring** and
**control**']{.mark}]{.underline}.

Finally, there is the subtle and insidious way in [which smart machines
might compromise the **conditions for moral development**]{.underline}.
If we accept that the fundamental aspiration of any moral community is
that its members should try to do the right thing, then this presupposes
a process of moral reflection and action that accords with one\'s moral
judgment. Of course, this does not imply that each agent will make the
same moral judgment or apply the same reasons. A utilitarian community
is very different to a Kantian community; but, in both cases, these are
moral communities and it is their shared aspiration to do the right
thing that is the lowest common denominator (Brownsword, 2013; 2018a).
Arguably, **[[liberty]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- in the sense of [having
the **practical option** of doing both the **right** thing and the
**wrong** thing]{.underline} -- [is **critical** to moral
community]{.underline}. On the East coast, where crime is rife and where
prudential reasoning dominates, the moral project is poorly realised;
but it is at least a community with moral possibilities and with room
for moral improvement. By contrast, in the well-ordered technologically
managed West coast, if the possibility of moral community is lost, then,
as Beyleveld and Brownsword emphasise, this should certainly give us
pause about the direction of travel in the criminal justice system.

[The ability to do the right thing]{.underline} also
**[[hinges]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only on individual deliberation,
but also [[on]{.mark} **public [moral
deliberation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [automated processes designed
to disable crime also]{.underline} typically mute and [disable public
moral deliberation. [If behaviour that]{.mark} previously [was]{.mark}
condemned and [prohibited has become **impossible**]{.mark} to engage
in]{.underline} (due to technological innovations), [[we are **less
likely** to debate it]{.mark}s justifiability]{.underline}. We will
never know whether speed limits are justified unless some people violate
them; [[we **can never know** whether]{.mark} certain
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline} on movement [[promote]{.mark} the
public [interest if]{.mark} such restrictions are **[enforced
perfectly]{.mark}** by using technological innovations]{.underline}. In
other words, [automated processes]{.underline} do not only erode
individual moral sensibilities; they also [**erode** public moral
deliberation]{.underline}.

### Impact---Entropy

#### Technical systems [are entropic]{.underline} - makes collapse [inevitable]{.underline}. 

**Featherstone, 17** \[Mark Featherstone Senior Lecturer in Sociology at
Keele University. "Planet Utopia: Utopia, Dystopia, and Globalisation,"
February 17, 2017\]//Townes

This is exactly what Baudrillard (2012) means when he writes of ecstatic
communication, which communicates nothing but the fact of communication
itself, and Serres (1983) reflects upon when he explains that [**[all
technical systems]{.underline}** [point towards
**entropy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, noise, and the black depths of the
universe. What this means is that the absolute [security of the
market]{.underline}, the realisation of Platonic form in the financial
utopia that led Ben Bernanke and others to speak of the great
moderation, [is also]{.underline} Badiou's (2006) void, the black
screen, the moment the numbers no longer seem to add up or make sense.
For mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (2004) the connection between these
two moments, **[the [point of total
securitisation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the black screen of nonsense,
[[runs through]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[accumulation of an
[endless]{.mark} number of [small events]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
come together [[to create]{.mark} a **[systemic tipping
point]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In his view these small deviations occur
because the logic of financial **[securitisation is fundamentally
flawed]{.underline}**. In his work on the unpredictability of markets he
asks, for example, what happens when the [trade in
derivatives]{.underline} and options starts to [feed back into the
valuation]{.underline} of stocks and shares to such an extent [that
price becomes absolutely distorted]{.underline}? What happens when it
becomes clear that probability is incapable of predicting the future
because it is based on calculations premised on the fantasy that what
has happened in the past will continue to happen in the future? Thus
Mandelbrot's (2004) point is that probability theory is ineffective in a
highly complex system because **[[there are too many
variables]{.underline}]{.mark}** and too many interactions to be able
[[to base prediction]{.underline}]{.mark} about the future
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} an assessment of [[the
past]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this way his fractal theory, which he
names in reference to the Greek fractus that means 'to break',
[[presents]{.underline}]{.mark} a picture of systemic uncertainty,
unpredictability, and potential [[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[contradicts]{.underline}]{.mark} the standard **[picture of
[cybernetic economy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[where]{.underline}
**[calculation]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and the ability to hedge
against fluctuation [enables]{.mark} the maintenance of
[stability]{.mark} and order.]{.underline}**

### Impact---Horizontal Escalation

#### Horizontal escalation is [more likely]{.underline} than vertical escalation.

**Joque, 18**---PhD from the European Grad School, researches
philosophy, technology and media and is the visualization librarian at
the University of Michigan, go blue (Justin, "Buffer Overflow: The Space
and Time of Cyberwar," *Deconstruction Machines: Writing in the Age of
Cyberwar*, Chapter 1, 65-66, dml)

In one sense, this [military investment in]{.underline} "metaphysical
control" and [new battle spaces]{.underline} is a continuation of
ancient strategies of deception, sabotage, and manipulation, but still
this contemporary explication [seems to mark a **qualitatively new
level** of abstraction and expansiveness]{.underline}. As DiNardo and
Hughes, two military historians and theorists, have warned, this focus
on a metaphysical battle space marks a military-- strategic investment
in the complete inversion of the Clausewitzean formula in which politics
is war by other means.70 In a 1995 article in Airpower Journal, they
worry that [the military focus on information warfare and subduing the
enemy outside of traditional fighting lends itself to a **complete
military intervention** into politics and civilian life]{.underline}.
Chun's insight that [software functions as **ideology**]{.underline} is
thus important in another regard: [both]{.underline} software and
ideology, along with law and economics, [become sites of intervention
that risk their symbolic functioning being **turned against
them**]{.underline}.71

Although [war spills over into **all aspects of everyday
life**]{.underline}, it is decidedly not total war. It is almost the
opposite: [a war **so constrained** and **reserved** that it nearly goes
**unnoticed**]{.underline}. As is argued in Unrestricted Warfare,
**[growing global interlinkages]{.underline}**, [including
**international law**]{.underline}, [the **shared
biosphere**]{.underline}, [a **highly connected global
economy**]{.underline}, [and the threat of **global thermonuclear
war**]{.underline}, [serve to **constrain many global
actors**]{.underline}. This is [**not** to suggest that these
constraints are **always** or even **often** effective or that they are
**positive** forces]{.underline}, [but they add **additional costs**
that **complicate political** and **military calculuses**]{.underline}.
All of [these serve to put **political limits** on military
options]{.underline}. [Instead of **vertical escalations** of conflict
to ever more violence]{.underline}, [we are witnessing a **horizontal
escalation** to **ever more varied modes** of conflict]{.underline}. [As
war spreads]{.underline}, [it **escalates horizontally** and strategists
attempt to **open new domains**]{.underline}. Thus
"[fighting]{.underline}" [begins to look **little** like previous
conflicts]{.underline}. For instance, the existence of both domestic and
international law opens the possibility that one force would be able to
limit another force's strategic options by litigation (a strategy
occasionally referred to as lawfare).72 These [global interconnections
have **raised the cost** of military escalation]{.underline}, [often
forcing states to fight within **specified rules** and **domains** for
fear of upsetting the global order and unleashing potentially more
destructive forces or disconnections]{.underline} from global spaces of
flow.

[Rather than a **completely accessible global battle space** where war
would rage unhindered]{.underline}, [we are witnessing the growth of a
**metaconflict** where]{.underline} strategists, legal experts, and
public relations [experts are constantly attempting to **define** and
**constrain war** for each side's]{.underline} strategic
[advantage]{.underline}. [The **concept** of war has now become **part
of war itself**]{.underline}. As Qiao and Wang argue, [the means
to]{.underline} contemporary [victory]{.underline} in war [involve
combining **limited ends** with **unlimited means**]{.underline}. They
are careful to say that this is not total war. Rather, it is a war that
weighs means and is not afraid to use any of them, but always to achieve
limited rather than total ends. This must be at least part of what
Virilio calls "pure war," or elsewhere the "race to the absolute essence
of war"73 as [military goals become increasingly limited while strategy
**expands infinitely**]{.underline}, culminating in "the war with zero
deaths for the military, but also zero victories in political terms."74
Rather than an all-out war, we are witnessing with the rise of cyberwar
a war that spills outside the bounds of traditional warfare while
remaining vertically constrained. [This is **not** to say that these
conflicts **cannot become horribly violent**]{.underline}; [for the
**further afield** these interventions stray]{.underline}, **[the more
they may be likely to spiral out of control]{.underline}**.

### Impact---Interventions

#### The global north maintains power through [digital management]{.underline} and [algorithmic biopolitics]{.underline} -- they cause exploitation and interventions

- How alt resolves? Exploitation happens not because of simply digital
  capitalism, but rather because of the way that we view Africa through
  technical metaphysics that calculates its utility

- Maybe a better aff card because it describes emerging tech broadly

**Oppegaard 22** (Doctoral Research Fellow, Department of Sociology and
Human Geography at [University of Oslo](https://twitter.com/UniOslo),
"The promise and peril of the digital economy") //ansel is tired

How [digital capitalism]{.underline}, despite often being framed as
potential growth engine, [exploits the already marginalized and
reproduces inequalities and power-relations]{.underline} between
Africans.

digital technologies enable new ways of organizing the production of
services, unconstrained by spatial distances. By making it possible to
carry out a service from everywhere in the world, [digitalization has
facilitated the increased fragmentation and outsourcing of services that
were previously constrained by the need for geographic proximity between
buyer and seller]{.underline}. The digitalization of the economy is at
the same time giving rise to new forms of work and new ways of
organizing labor processes---across the globe.

In The Digital Continent: Placing Africa in Planetary Networks of Work,
Mohammed Amir Anwar and Mark Graham explore the development and
organization of digital labor---[defined as "work activities involving
the paid manipulation of digital data by humans through \[information
and communication technologies]{.underline}\] such as mobile phones,
computers, laptops, etc."---in Africa. [They argue that African workers
are playing an increasingly central role in digital capitalism by
training "**artificial intelligence" and machine learning algorithms**,
tagging images, and performing customer services, design tasks, **data
management**, and so on]{.underline}. Thus, Anwar and Graham argue that
digital capitalism is---despite rarely being mentioned---increasingly
"made in Africa." The aim of their book is to make both African workers
and Africa as a core location in the digital economy visible.

Based on extensive fieldwork in five countries---Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria,
South Africa, and Uganda---Anwar and Graham first argue that
digitalization has made [African countries lucrative destinations for
offshoring services]{.underline}. [They explore two such cases:
"business process offshoring," where a firm outsources non-core
functions to specialized subcontractors, and the "remote gig economy,"
composed of service tasks (such as writing, transcription, search engine
optimization, and so on) mediated and coordinated by digital platforms
and carried out by individual workers for customers who can be located
anywhere]{.underline}. [Second, they show how the African labor force is
increasingly drawn into the digital economy, as workers who struggle to
find employment in the "analog" sector of the economy turn to digital
labor to make a living]{.underline}. This, Anwar and Graham argue,
raises concerns for employment protections, social rights, and working
conditions on digital platforms.

[Anwar and Graham intervene in a prominent narrative promoted by
governments, the World Bank, development organizations, and consulting
firms that frames digitalization and information and communication
technologies as "technological fixes" that will create jobs, reduce
poverty, improve productivity, and lead to economic growth in
Africa]{.underline}. Although digitalization and the fragmentation and
outsourcing of production processes has integrated Africa into global
production networks, Anwar and Graham argue that "Af[rica continues to
be locked into a value-extractive position in the global
economy]{.underline}." Rather than a frictionless and "flat" global
economy, Anwar and Graham's analyses show how [digitalization amplifies
existing inequalities and power relations; in Africa, digital production
is primarily characterized by poorly remunerated tasks at the bottom of
the value chain that do not, in practice, represent economic
improvements for workers]{.underline}.

For some segments of the population, such as university-educated workers
unable to capitalize on their credentials, the digital economy provides
an important lifeline. On the one hand, these forms of work provide a
certain flexibility and autonomy. Workers are often able to, at least
partially, set their own schedules. On the other hand, however, [digital
labor can]{.underline} also [contribute to precarity]{.underline}, [as
contracts are usually short, working hours long, and social benefits and
labor rights irregular or lacking]{.underline}. This is, Anwar and
Graham argue, partially a result of workers being classified as
self-employed independent contractors, the piece-rate model of
compensation, and the ease with which digital firms can transfer tasks
to another worker, company, or continent.

In addition, Anwar and Graham highlight the so-called ["algorithmic
management" used in these digital business models. Digitalization, they
argue, is not only a tool for capital's expansion into new localities,
markets, and industries---digital technologies also enable managers to
exert new forms of control over workers and labor
processes]{.underline}. [The authors term this form of management
"digital Taylorism," a digital manifestation of the Taylorist principles
of detailed surveillance, meticulous control over labor process,
disassembly of the production process, and "deskilling" every task to
improve productivity and lower the costs of labor power]{.underline}.
[While the notion of "digital Taylorism" highlights platform capital's
control over workers and labor processes, it might neglect a key feature
of "algorithmic management]{.underline}": its strategic use of freedom
and flexibility. While Taylor's "scientific management" instructed
workers on how each particular task should be performed, [digital
platforms usually allow workers to choose when they want to work, what
tasks they want to do, and how they want to do them---partially in an
effort to avoid being classified as their employers]{.underline}.
Moreover, worker evaluation occurs through rating systems, with workers
being sanctioned with moves like "deactivation" or firing if their
average rating falls below a certain threshold. Thus, "[algorithmic
management" might be seen as representing a mode of management and
control diverging from the core principles of Taylorism]{.underline}.

Furthermore, it is important to emphasize the ways in which workers
assert agency and resist capital's control, as Anwar and Graham do in
detail. Drawing on the notion of "hidden transcripts," they theorize
labor agency not solely in organized and collective action, finding that
digital workers in Africa exert individual agency through everyday
practices and strategies of "resilience, reworking, and resistance."

The Digital Continent is a very well-researched and well-written book.
Anwar and Graham build on an impressively rich empirical material,
mixing statistics and excerpts from interviews to give readers a proper
understanding of workers' lives, struggles, and aspirations. The
presentation jumps eloquently between theoretical discussions,
explications of labor geography concepts, and empirical investigations,
producing thorough and thought-provoking analyses. This is particularly
true for the final chapter, where the authors discuss measures for
building a fairer global economy and world of work.

As a researcher studying platform work in the Norwegian transportation
industry, the similarities between the working conditions, biographies,
and experiences of the workers I interview in Oslo and the workers I met
in The Digital Continent is striking. They are drawn from similar
segments of the labor force and express the same ambivalence toward the
real economic opportunities---combined with precarious working
conditions---offered by the digital business models. Despite the field's
recent emphasis on how digital business models are being "embedded" in
local social, political, and economic contexts, these models seem to
create surprisingly similar outcomes in very different parts of the
world. This puzzle might suggest that [although digital labor platforms
have to adjust to local conditions, regulations, and so on, they also
function as technological and global capitalist machines]{.underline},
[exporting the same employment model and "algorithmic management" from
Silicon Valley (where they are usually designed) to every corner of the
world, creating similar outcomes for workers regardless of their
different contexts while also taking advantage of local
specificities]{.underline}. This highlights Anwar and Graham's
conclusion that the fight for a fair digital economy has to be global.

### Impact---Manifest Destiny

#### Mission accomplished -- to Manifest Destiny is to reach across the world in favor of the white economy -- baiting humanity into capital under the neo-human automaton. The incongruity between Western individuation and the neo-human automaton births the self-destructive swarm on path to extinction

Mission Accomplished

I am curious to see how [the upcoming twentieth anniversary celebrations
of the Islamist **attack on the Manhattan towers** unfolds. Perhaps
there will be no celebrations. **European newspapers will not write:
\"we are all Americans,**\" like they did the day Bush declared war on
Afghanistan. In fact, **America has lost**]{.underline}.

While the defeat in Vietnam was a national drama, [the Afghan defeat
does not scratch the American conscience because the American population
is incapable of seeing failure because of the **epidemic of dementia**
that grips it.]{.underline}

[The defeat in Vietnam was not terminal; the defeat in Afghanistan
is]{.underline}. While still the greatest military power of all times,
[the United States no longer has one essential thing: itself. There is
no longer the United States of America, **there are at least two**, and
they are in fierce struggle]{.underline}. [So, as fires consume an
ever-widening area of territory and converge on its megacities, as
psychotic shootings remain a daily occurrence, the country **no longer
has a governing government and never will again**.]{.underline}

[Osama **bin Laden's victory is now final**, and the victories of all
the great leaders of past history **pale in comparison**. Bin Laden has
defeated the two greatest powers of all time: the USSR and the
USA]{.underline}. What happened to the Soviet Union after the Afghan
defeat is well known. [We are now waiting to see what will happen to the
United States]{.underline}, and it is legitimate to hope that the
effects will be equally definitive. [American **society is irreparably
split**, engaged in a headlong process of social, cultural and psychic
disintegration. The civil war is not political, but daily, molecular,
omnipresent.]{.underline}

[Can we hope, then, that the collapse of American power will restore
humans to the human]{.underline}?

[I\'m afraid not, because this **collapse comes too late**]{.underline}:
[America has already largely completed its mission,]{.underline} which
was not to establish the kingdom of democracy, as they told us, but [to
destroy mankind]{.underline}.

[John Sullivan coined the expression **Manifest Destiny**]{.underline}
[to define the civilizing mission of the American idealists]{.underline}
(but weren't the leaders of the SS, the propagators of the joy of the
German superior race, also idealist?). [That mission was to bring
freedom into the world, or more realistically to **transform human life
into** a mere articulation of the absolute domination of
**capital**]{.underline}.

[The stages of this process: primitive accumulation based on slavery and
on genocide. Constant intensification of the productivity of workers
through the systematic dehumanization of social relations.]{.underline}

**[That mission is accomplished]{.underline}**.

[While]{.underline} some [big companies]{.underline} (Big Pharma,
Amazon, big finance) [are making unprecedented profits today, and
increasing their earnings every day, psychosis takes over the collective
mind, depression is rampant, freely available weapons of war kill
unfortunates every day, wages are decreasing, working conditions are
increasingly precarious,]{.underline} and in the meantime the [forests
burn and the cities are hopeless]{.underline} traps.

[The purpose of the American wars was not to win. It was to destroy the
conditions of life]{.underline}, and to [reduce the living to insane
ghosts like those who now roam the metropolises of the world. **So the
neo-human automaton will thrive**]{.underline}.

[In 1992 the first summit on climate change]{.underline} was held in Rio
de Janeiro. On that occasion, the American president, George
[Bush]{.underline} senior, [declared that \"the standard of living of
Americans]{.underline} [is not negotiable.\"]{.underline}

The standard of living of Americans consists in [consuming four times
more energy than the average inhabitants of the planet. It consists of
psychopathic bulimia that produces obesity and acquisitive
aggression.]{.underline}

It consists of [consuming meat in insane quantities. And so
on.]{.underline}

[Consumerism and commercial advertising were perhaps the most decisive
contributions to the destruction of the conditions of
livability]{.underline} of the planetary environment, as the
[extermination of the human is intrinsic to the neo-human character of
Puritan Protestantism from which the idea of ​​the Manifest Destiny was
born. The **digital automaton is the accomplishment of this American
Dream**.]{.underline}

The Swarm

In the twenty-first century, the manifest destiny of the USA has turned
into the cancellation of conjunctive impurity, the full realization of
the project of integral digitization and connection of the biological
within the neo-human flow.

[The integral automation project is now underway, but due to a
surprising joke (fate is cynical and cruel), it will not be the
Westerners that will enjoy it]{.underline} (so to speak).

What is more likely is that [the beneficiary of this accursed bonanza
will be a nation both more patient and less individualistic, with a
people who tends to operate as if in the mode of a unified cognitive
organism, and whose vocabulary is not anchored in that most deceptive of
words: \"freedom.\"]{.underline}

[In pre-capitalist history, technics developed as a structured and
functional mode of objects handled by man]{.underline}. In the course of
the modern evolution of the capitalist mode of production, however,
[technology has been transformed into an operational framework within
which man is forced to act, and from which he is not permitted to
leave]{.underline}.

Following Heidegger, the Chinese thinker Yuk Hui sees [in the concept of
Gestell or 'enframing']{.underline} the keystone of that transformation
whereby technics [becomes a key player in the mutation of humanity into
a cognitive Automa. Technology establishes Gestalten (structured forms)
within which human action is increasingly pre-ordered]{.underline}, to
the point of operating like a swarm.

[This technological mutation]{.underline}, which found its laboratory in
California and which took the West as its field of experimentation,
[established the \"**neo human\" model of a formatted, compatible, and
connected man**. Society becomes **a swarm** in which the movements of
individuals are guided by a single brain]{.underline}, on which
individual brains depend.

But the experimental [automaton is only partially operative in the West,
for reasons that are bound up with the cultural and cognitive
peculiarities of the]{.underline} individuation process in the [Western
sphere: the common cognitive basis, linked to language learning, is
thin, and resistance to the swarm-model is high]{.underline}.

The [automaton seems to work much better in the sphere of ideographic
languages, **namely China**, because the process of individuation is
based on a twofold common cognitive basis]{.underline}: [the **learning
of spoken language and the ideographic transcription**. The Chinese mind
is more easily integrated thanks to the different characteristics of the
identification process]{.underline} (language acquisition, double neural
molding, easy adhesion to the swarm model).

**[Cashing-In on Devastation]{.underline}**

[Sangihe]{.underline} is one of the countless islands of the Indonesian
archipelago. The island [was once home to a blue bird. It seemed as if
the bird had all but disappeared, when it was recently discovered that
he still hops in the forests.]{.underline} But there is not only the
sparrow, [there are also some tens of thousands of people living on the
island]{.underline}. Fishermen, gatherers, craftsmen, teachers,
students.

Some time back, [a Canadian company obtained a concession on half of the
subsoil because it was recently discovered that there is gold. Until
recently, Indonesian state law prohibited extraction from the subsoil of
the islands]{.underline}, but [last year **international pressure led to
the abolition** of that law]{.underline}. Extraction is now legal, and
[the Canadian company that owns the **exploitation rights** is coming
forward to enforce its rights]{.underline}.

[This story]{.underline} --- documented in a BBC video you can find here
--- [is by no means a new one. It has been like this for a few hundred
years: **white predators arrive** in any place on earth, they discover
that they can **extract a mineral that has value for the white
economy**]{.underline} ([perhaps a useless mineral like gold, loaded
with immense religious significance, to the point that it can be
considered the totem of that superstitious belief known as
\"economics]{.underline}"). [The white predators destroy
everything]{.underline}, they [subject the humans]{.underline} who
inhabit the territory [to]{.underline} an [excruciating pace of work in
return for]{.underline} which they give them [a salary]{.underline}, a
car, a house with all [the essential accessories of that mousetrap in
which salaried workers are accustomed to dwelling]{.underline}. [By now
they have destroyed almost everything, **so now the world has begun to
burn, and will certainly burn, until the human race is erased**, except
perhaps a few specimens that will manage to escape aboard shuttles into
outer space]{.underline}, where they will spend the rest of their sad
days in cages floating around in the void.

But [some islands]{.underline} of the planet earth [have not yet been
totally captured by the exterminators]{.underline}, because they are too
remote. [For example, Sangihe]{.underline}.

[To the question: "what will you gain by carrying out your
project"]{.underline} (cutting down the forests, drilling the ground,
extracting the ore that economic superstition considers precious)?
[the]{.underline} bald peaceful [representative of the mining company
replies with a good laugh: "Millions and millions of
dollars]{.underline}. When we are at full capacity we plan to extract
thousands of ounces a month in a few years.\"

And there will be [work for five thousand people]{.underline}. Five
thousand people will be [able to stop fishing, build useful objects for
the community, study, and will finally go a few hundred meters
underground eight hours a day in exchange for a salary]{.underline} that
allows them to have a car, to replace their home with a mousetrap and so
on.

The story left an impression on me, because it contains nearly
everything you need to know about modernity in four and a half minutes
of film. [The destruction of life, pleasure, beauty, affection, joy,
sunrise, sunset, food, breath, in exchange for a car, a salary, and lung
cancer --- in a word: the economy]{.underline}.

[After five centuries there are still places on which such Western
'care' has not been imposed. Forests are burning, rivers are
overflowing, wars are multiplying, depression is rampant, but somewhere,
progress has not yet arrived**. Let\'s bring it there quickly, before
the show is over**.]{.underline}

[It\'s a matter of years now. **Extinction is no longer a distant
prospect**, but an issue that concerns the present
generation]{.underline}, the same one that cannot even go to school
because there is a mysterious virus. Before being swallowed by the
rapidly spreading apocalypse, [we must not neglect to drag the poor
inhabitants of Sangihe into it, since they have not yet enjoyed the
fruits of Western progress.]{.underline}

This progress finds in the United States of America its vanguard and its
symbol.

### Impact---Meltdowns

#### Technospheric breakdown causes [global nuclear meltdowns]{.underline}---[extinction]{.underline}. 

**Nadesan '14** \[Majia; September 13; professor of communication at
ASU, their interdisciplinary research examines the ethical implications
of societal governing logics and risk-management strategies; "The
Nuclear Energy Paradigm Collides with Earth Changes and Technospheric
Breakdown," The Millenium Report,
themillenniumreport.com/2014/09/will-fukushima-become-an-extinction-level-event\]

[**As Technospheric Breakdown Accelerates, Nuclear** Power Generation
**Mishaps will Increase and Intensify**]{.underline}

There is really no way around this eventuality. [As all the nuclear
power plants age, they will succumb to the **micro-stresses** which
**inevitably** occur in such **a**n ever-**deteriorating environment**.
Most people are **unaware** of the true depth and breadth of
technospheric breakdown since it is a concept **rarely taken up by
academia** or the media]{.underline}. The following excerpts provide a
wider perspective of [this unavoidable byproduct of the Industrial
Revolution.]{.underline}

[Technospheric breakdown is something that occurs **everywhere** around
the globe, **24/7**, without interruption, and with tremendous
repercussions]{.underline}. Let's start with [anything that has been
manufactured in the factories of the modern world or built on the
surface of the Earth.]{.underline} Simply put, everything [is in the
constant state of breaking down, degeneration,
deterioration.]{.underline}

What does this really mean when we say that every bridge is slowly
breaking down, every road is in greater disrepair with each passing day,
every reservoir is gradually degrading, every office building, every
factory, every school, every home, etc. most of which adhered to very
low building standards in the first place?

What does it mean when [the infrastructure for every]{.underline} sewer
[system]{.underline}, municipal water division, electrical grid,
airport, railway station, etc. [is in a slow but sure process of
degrading and breaking down. So]{.underline}, unfortunately, [is **every
nuclear power plant across the planet**.]{.underline} (Cosmic
Convergence)

[What makes this ongoing process of physical degradation so insidious is
that it almost always occurs **subliminally**]{.underline}. Through a
gathering array of various forces throughout post-modern civilization,
there does exist a sort of conspiracy of circumstances which has greatly
magnified the effects of technospheric breakdown. The completed marriage
between the industrial base of the Western powers and the financial
class throughout the world has guaranteed that this slow motion collapse
will continue unabated. How so?

Because so many corporate decisions are made according to their impact
on the bottom line, [many inferior nuclear power plants have been
constructed around the globe.]{.underline} Likewise, because the
mega-banks and investment houses are now dictating to a
financially-strapped Nuclear Energy Industry, [**substandard** nuclear
**reactors** have been designed, engineered and **continue to be** put
**in**to **operation** across the planet.]{.underline} One only has to
take a close look at the websites dedicated to decommissioned nuclear
reactors or cold shutdowns or partially closed nuclear power plants or
emergency actions taken at various nuclear power generation sites to
grasp just how precarious a position the entire industry is currently
in.

Unknown to even many of the nuclear engineers who address these issues
'in the office', or who fix the cascade of problems at nuke plants
themselves, is the notion of [slow motion, subclinical, pernicious
technospheric breakdown.]{.underline} It often [manifests in ways where
cause and effect cannot be easily established because of some of the
unseen forces produced by atomic fission.]{.underline} With that said,
it should be noted that a chapter could easily be dedicated to this
particular issue alone, so significant is it to the future of nuclear
power generation

Then there is the problem of **[nuclear wastes]{.underline}** and
natural rights, yes?

No one has articulated this point better than Albert Bates in his
definitive essay entitled The Karma of Kerma: Nuclear Wastes and Natural
Rights (Bates, A.K., 1988)

This extremely lucid and illuminating, sober and sane treatment of [the
**greatest ongoing environmental disaster** of our times]{.underline}
lays bare the most basic legal and human rights issues which [converge
around the production, treatment and storage of nuclear
wastes.]{.underline} Were the governments of the world to read and take
to heart its simple and straightforward thesis, the current incarnation
of nuclear energy production would have been abandoned years ago:

[The disposal of radioactive substances in a manner that anticipates
their eventual partial release into the human environment imposes a
**health burden** upon **future generations** that **cannot be
justified**]{.underline} by any moral or legal rationale. Like an
irresistible force meeting an immovable object, the concept of the
greater good for the many in the present generation runs against the
concept of the inalienable rights of each individual in future eras. At
present, in matters involving nuclear power, our governmental agencies
have taken the side of the irresistible force. But when federal agencies
venture to tread beyond of the scope of the foundation principles with
which the federal government was fashioned, they endanger more than
human lives. At risk in the nuclear waste debate are long-held concepts
of ordered liberty. (Bates A. K., 1988)

Fukushima has illustrated exactly why this elegantly stated legal
concept of human rights and moral imperative is so pertinent to the
public discourse. [When massive amounts of radioactive wastewater are
dumped into the Pacific Ocean, not only **human life** will be adversely
affected. Marine life has been negatively impacted in ways that will
take decades to observe and comprehend.]{.underline} The outright
destruction of the environment in and around Fukushima and the Pacific
Ocean must also be considered in any meaningful assessment of collateral
damage.

Perhaps even more than Chernobyl, [Fukushima has allowed the global
community to view the whole event]{.underline} through the lens of legal
responsibility and ethical outcomes [so that new international standards
can be written and implemented]{.underline} regarding nuclear waste
conveyance and disposal. If nothing else, this discussion has raised
awareness about the most nagging issue concerning the NEP. Whereas the
human rights aspect confers the legal right to not be contaminated by
nuclear radiation has barely been addressed by those responsible for it
consequences, it now enjoys a prominent place throughout the worldwide
debate.

[Accidents and mishaps, manmade and natural disasters
happen.]{.underline} Things are fixed fairly quickly in this postmodern
age, and life goes on. Whether these events occur in a full-blown war
zone or in the wake of a hurricane, the affected population usually does
everything it can to rebuild and move on.

[However, when these events take place in or near nuclear power plants,
**life** doesn't just go on. It often **stops**]{.underline}. Depending
on the circumstances and seriousness of a nuclear event, [sometimes life
stops in that area for a long time.]{.underline}

[Our **civilization** has]{.underline} now [been given]{.underline}
three unmistakable **[wakeup calls]{.underline}** since the advent of
the nuclear power generation era. First there was [Three Mile
Island]{.underline} in Pennsylvania, then there was
[Chernobyl]{.underline} in the Ukraine, and lastly the world is still
reeling from the specter of possibilities which are presented by
[Fukushima]{.underline}.

Surely [it is not by chance that these three flagrant examples of
nuclear Perfect Storms occurred around the globe affecting major nations
and populations centers]{.underline}. Each of these disasters has served
to wake up whole swaths of humanity to the dangers and risks which are
associated with the current Nuclear Energy Paradigm. To ignore, or deny,
or refute the obvious lessons which all three nuclear catastrophes have
given to humankind would be folly of the highest order.

[The **global impact** of Fukushima, which has disseminated
radionuclides (radioactive contaminants) by air and by way of the
largest of the seven seas, stands as dramatic testimony to all that can
go wrong]{.underline} --- seriously wrong --- with the current nuclear
energy business model and method of power generation. [**Can it get any
worse** than Fukushima? That we are compelled to even ask this question
speaks volumes about the true state of the affairs]{.underline} on that
25 square mile patch of land and contiguous sea which surround the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster site.

Given this inescapable testament of nuclear folly, it is now incumbent
upon the community of nations to rally around the obvious necessity of
terminating the current form of the Nuclear Energy Paradigm. Why?
Because when a "China Syndrome" occurs anywhere in the world, **[it will
inevitably affect the entire planet]{.underline}**. In other words, an
INES Level 7 (Wikipedia, International Nuclear Event Scale) [nuclear
catastrophe does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate between
the young and old, healthy and sick, or those who live close to ground
zero from those who live far away.]{.underline}

Therefore, any nation that chooses to set up a nuclear energy-producing
operation from this point forward has an inviolable responsibility to
its neighbors, as it does to the rest of the world. Likewise, those
[nations have a moral obligation to proceed in a manner that guarantees
its neighbors will not be exposed to the consequences of its nuclear
accidents, even when they are caused by duel **natural disaster** events
as we saw at Fukushima.]{.underline}

Just as Europe was contaminated with radiation from Chernobyl (Yablokov,
A.V., 2009), and North America has been contaminated from Fukushima, it
is understood that [once a nuclear catastrophe spirals out of control,
the genie of radioactive **contamination cannot be put back in the
bottle**.]{.underline} The entire Pacific Rim, in fact, has varying
degrees of exposure to the radioactive waste water being conveyed by the
ocean from Fukushima, as does the Western Hemisphere to seaborne
radioactive isotopes like Cesium-137 and airborne isotopes such as
Iodine-131(Center for Marine and Environmental Radiation).

Consequently, Japan is responsible for the damage wrought to the largest
ocean on Earth. Have they acknowledged this? Have they approached the
nations both near and far which have been affected by their cavalier and
irresponsible approach to siting reactors up and down their seismic
shorelines? Has the United Nations even addressed this extremely
important issue known as national accountability? Or territorial
sovereignty?

Conclusion

It doesn't get very much more weighty than the 'fallout from Fukushima'.
All of the affected nations have been curiously silent on this issue. It
is almost as though a conspiracy of silence has descended upon the
concerned countries because of how unpredictable and intractable the
nuclear containment problems have been at the Daiichi plant.

At the end of the day [the current race of **humanity** will look back
on the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster as the **defining
moment**]{.underline} for both the industry and the underlying paradigm.
If they haven't already, the [various stakeholders will be forced to
re-evaluate the integrity of their nuclear enterprises]{.underline}
around the globe. [**Hopefully**, they will begin to take aggressive
**preemptive measures** to address whatever needs to be addressed at
every nuclear site still in operation.]{.underline}

[If a **decisive response** is not formulated]{.underline} and
implemented on a global scale, in light of the hard lessons learned from
Fukushima, [the current planetary **civilization** will be compelled to
face up to these **fatal flaws** in most unpleasant ways, which will
continue to manifest with each major Earth change.]{.underline} In a
similar way, the inherent [defects]{.underline} of the NEP [will only be
accentuated as technospheric breakdown accelerates.]{.underline} The
profound and fundamental shortcomings which pervade the entire nuclear
energy industry can no longer be hidden or ignored.

### Alt---Cloud Ethics

#### The alternative is cloud ethics, which chooses an episteme of [opacity]{.underline} over [cybernetic transparency]{.underline}.

**Amoore 20** (Louise Amoore, Professor of Political Geography at Durham
University, "Cloud Ethics: Algorithms and the Attributes of Ourselves
and Others", Duke University Press, 8/30/20,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1800782>) // EL

In this book I propose a different way of thinking about the
ethicopolitics of algorithms. [What I call a cloud ethics is concerned
with the political formation of relations to oneself and to others that
is taking place, increasingly, in and through algorithms]{.underline}.
My use of the term cloud here is not confined to the redefined
sovereignties and technologies of a "cloud computing era," as understood
by Benjamin Bratton and others, [but refers to the apparatus through
which cloud data and algorithms gather in new and emergent forms. The
cloud in my cloud ethics is thus closer to that envisaged by John Durham
Peters, for whom clouds are media in the sense that they are "containers
of possibility that anchor our existence and make what we are doing
possible."]{.underline} To consider algorithms as having ethics in
formation is to work with the propensities and possibilities that
algorithms embody, pushing the potentials of their arrangements beyond
the decisive moment of the output. [A cloud ethics acknowledges that
algorithms contain, within their spatial arrangements, multiple
potentials for cruelties, surprises, violences, joys, distillations of
racism and prejudice, injustices, probabilities, discrimination, and
chance.]{.underline} Indeed, many of the features that some would like
to excise from the algorithm---bias, assumptions, weights---are routes
into opening up their politics. Algorithms come to act in the world
precisely in and through the relations of selves to selves, and selves
to others, as these relations are manifest in the clusters and
attributes of data. To learn from relations of selves and others, the
algorithm must already be replete with values, thresholds, assumptions,
probability weightings, and bias. In a real sense, an algorithm must
necessarily discriminate to have any traction in the world. The very
essence of algorithms is that they afford greater degrees of recognition
and value to some features of a scene than they do to others. In so
doing, algorithms generate themselves as ethicopolitical beings in the
world. If to have ethics is not merely to have a code prohibiting, for
example, bias or assumptions, but to work on oneself via relations, then
the ethicopolitics of algorithms involves investigations of how they
learn to recognize and to act, how they extract assumptions from data
relations, and how they learn what ought to be from relations with other
humans and algorithms. [To be clear, the cloud ethics I propose here
does not belong to an episteme of accountability, transparency, and
legibility, but on the contrary begins with the opacity, partiality, and
illegibility of all forms of giving an account, human and algorithmic.
To advance a cloud ethics is to engage the ungrounded politics of all
forms of ethical relations.]{.underline} The significant new ethical
challenges that algorithms seem to present to society actually manifest
novel features of some profoundly old problems of the grounds for
ethical action. As Judith Butler explains in her Spinoza lectures, the
demand to give an account of oneself will always fall short, for "I
cannot give an account of myself without accounting for the conditions
under which I emerge." If one assumes that the determination of an
unequivocal I who acts is a necessary precondition of ethics, as Butler
cautions, then this identifiable self is "dispossessed" by the condition
of its emergence in relation to others. For Butler, this persistent
failure to give a clear-sighted account does not mark the limit point of
ethics. On the contrary, the opaque and unknowable nature of making all
kinds of acting subjects is the condition of possibility of having an
ethicopolitical life. In short, and in contrast to the equation of
ethics with transparency and disclosure, ethical responsibility is
sustained by conditions of partiality and opacity. [My notion of a cloud
ethics extends the opacity of the human subject, envisaging a plurality
of venues for ethical responsibility in which all selves---human and
algorithmic---proceed from their illegibility. The apparent opacity and
illegibility of the algorithm should not pose an entirely new problem
for human ethics, for the difficulty of locating clear-sighted action
was already present.]{.underline} The I who forms the ethical relation
was always in question and is now, with algorithms, in question in new
ways. Though the mathematical propositions of algorithms cannot be made
fully legible, or rendered accountable, they can be called to give
accounts of the conditions of their emergence. These conditions include
some relations that are identifiably between humans and
algorithms---such as the selection and labeling of training data, the
setting of target outputs, or the editing of code "in the wild," for
example---but others still are relations of algorithms to another
algorithm, such as a classifier supplying the training data from which a
neural network will learn. In all such instances of iterative learning,
the significant point is that the conditions of an algorithm's
emergence---a composite of human-algorithm relations---are venues for
ethicopolitics. In a discussion on the impossibility of the transparent
algorithm, the brilliant and generous scholar of black studies and
machine learning Ramon Amaro once said, "Well what would it be if we
even could open it? It's just math." Of course, he intended the comment
as a provocation, but mathematics is never only "just math," as Amaro's
work vividly shows. To reflect on the conditions of an algorithm's
emergence is also to consider how, as mathematical knowledge forms,
algorithms have achieved the status of objective certainty and
definiteness in an uncertain world. Ludwig Wittgenstein observed
mathematical propositions to be "given the stamp of incontestability," a
mark of the "incontrovertible" and an "exemption from doubt" that other
propositions, such as "I am called," are not afforded. For Wittgenstein,
mathematics as practice---like all other language games---is concerned
with particular uses of propositions, where "what a proposition is, is
in one sense determined by the rules of sentence formation, and in
another sense by the use of the sign in the language game." His concern
is that the mathematical proposition has achieved a particular status of
certainty in an otherwise uncertain world, so that it becomes "a hinge
on which your dispute can turn." For Wittgenstein, the mathematical
proposition should be regarded as no less doubtful or uncertain than the
"empirical propositions" otherwise made about the world. Indeed,
Wittgenstein's point is to address mathematical propositions as
empirical actions that are "in no way different from the actions of the
rest of our lives, and are in the same degree liable to forgetfulness,
oversight and illusion." Following Wittgenstein, the use of mathematical
propositions is profoundly social and, in my reading, ethicopolitical.
An algorithm is formulated through a series of truth claims about its
match to the world, and yet, in its use in the world it is as prone to
forgetfulness, oversight, misrecognition, and illusion as any other
language game. Algorithms such as those used to detect latent social
unrest in the city may appear in the world as Wittgenstein's "hinge on
which your protest can turn" in the most direct sense that the hinge
delimits and circumscribes the arc of the politics of protest. But the
algorithm as hinge does not merely mark the limit point of resistance;
rather, it presents something as a singular optimal output, when it is
actually generated through multiple and contingent relations. [My cloud
ethics considers the algorithmic hinge to be akin to Karen Barad's
scientific apparatus, which decides what matters in the world, what or
who can be recognized, what can be protested, and which claims can be
brought. Understood in this way, the algorithm is not the hinge as an
incontrovertible axis, exempted from doubt, on which all social,
political, and economic life turns.]{.underline} "The hinge point," as
Foucault differently identifies, can also be the point of "ethical
concerns and political struggle," as well as the point of "critical
thought against abusive techniques of government."

### Alt---Ecological Ethics

#### Vote neg for a reorientation of human agency towards a co-evolutionary assemblage with technology.

[Given the current forecasts for the Anthropocene, an **ecological
ethics** emphasizes the **urgent need** for **modifying current
practices**]{.underline}. As Cubitt (2005: 59) astutely observes,
'[Techne is the only route through which we can now sense the
world]{.underline}, most especially the part of the world's
conversations which are not conducted in wavelengths we can hear, see or
otherwise comprehend.' [Without contemporary information-processing
technologies, humans would not have sufficiently developed
understandings of looming **ecological crises** to enact urgent calls to
action]{.underline}. This is exemplified by the fact that when
considering climatic trends, we are addressing global datasets with
durations measured in decades and centuries -- a temporal scale far
slower and a spatial scale far larger than those readily perceptible to
humans.

[We can only understand climate change **via technological mediations**
which allow us to **see enduring trends** within noisy, chaotic and
complex global climatic systems]{.underline}. This **[technocultural
assemblage]{.underline}** includes satellites that measure tropospheric
temperatures, thermal drills that can extract 3-kilometre-deep ice cores
from polar regions and the storage facilities that preserves these
geological artefacts, and the supercomputers that are used to simulate
climatic futures. **[Ecological ethics]{.underline}**, then, [must not
advocate abandoning mediation and technology as a means of retreating to
a romanticized past but instead **requires reorienting modes of
production and consumption** towards ecologically beneficial
outcomes.]{.underline} Only through [repurposing technics along
ecological lines -- creating commonwealth rather than commodities -- are
potential solutions to ecological crises likely to become visible;
**there exists no option to return** to a pre-industrial state before
technics supposedly altered the harmonious 'balance of nature', as is
commonly suggested by conservationist and deep ecological
discourses.]{.underline}

Applying such an ethics to contemporary media practices means
considering the ways in which media systems at varying scales create
novel connections and forms of commons and public good, and at the same
time involve the usage of energy and materials which close off other
avenues via their ecological costs. [Ecological ethics is based on
praxis rather than pure reason, encouraging experimentation and creative
interventions designed to produce **positive biopolitical
impacts**]{.underline}. [It entails realizing that while there are
detrimental consequences stemming from currently produced technologies,
there are **bifurcation points**]{.underline} whereby the agential
capacities of [**assemblages afford meaningful positive changes** to be
made to these systems by using theoffending technologies]{.underline}.
This is not hypocrisy, but does [require a praxis that **abandons an
idealistic purity.**]{.underline}

[At the level of content, this means exploring how information flows
have created the **commodified economy** of attention, **problematic
discourses** of Big Data and the context of **communicative
capitalism**, while **investigating** how **ideology, cognitive frames**
and cognitive dissonance act as brakes which prevent subjects from
altering opinions and effecting change.]{.underline} At the level of
software, this entails considering issues surrounding licensing,
software development and the types of freedom maintained by the free
software movement, alongside issues surrounding surveillance, user
privacy and the contemporary movement towards the commodification of web
protocols as evidenced within HTML5. Within the realm of hardware, this
involves examining the flows of energy and matter which comprise and
maintain the physical architecture of the network society, considering
the material impacts that these flows have on ecological systems at
every stage in the life cycle of microelectronics devices. [Across all
scales this additionally requires an **examination** of the multiple
ways that powerful actors seek to utilize existing and novel
**hierarchies** to **perpetuate** privileged positions and
**technocultural systems** that are currently leading us towards
**social and ecological catastrophe**.]{.underline}

[Media ecology suggests that an **experimental praxis** with various
commons-orientated projects across the scales of content, software and
hardware is necessary if **ecologically resilient** and **equitable
alternatives** are to supplant current **practices of
mediation**.]{.underline} [While openness is often proclaimed to be the
defining characteristic of commons-based peer-to-peer systems, **media
ecology** follows Bauwens in arguing that openness alone is not enough
to **guarantee ecologically beneficial outcomes**.]{.underline}
Alongside openness, projects require commitments to social solidarity
and ecological resilience if they are to escape reterritorialization.

Rather than an abstract mode of thought, [ecological ethics emphasizes
**embodied acts of engagement** as a method of
becoming-ethical.]{.underline} Praxis additionally forms a model which
resists contemporary processes of proletarianization, [which sees
knowledge becomes embodied within technologies]{.underline},
[constituting an industrialization of memory and the externalization of
communal knowledge into **corporate technics**]{.underline}. Without
some degree of knowledge and experience regarding the complex and
distributed processes of mediation which are increasingly central to
contemporary life, [we have little agency to affect and alter these
assemblages along eco-ethical lines. Ecological ethics contends that
such knowledge is derived from material practices rather than abstract
speculation]{.underline}; following Deleuze, [we do not know what a
digital assemblage can do, but **through experimentation** we can
**produce forms and practices** that can help to **realize
change**.]{.underline} 'Make a rhizome. But you don't know what you can
make a rhizome with, you don't know which subterranean stem is
effectively going to makea rhizome, or enter a becoming, people your
desert. So experiment' (Deleuze and Guattari 1982: 277). [We cannot
exhaustively know the capacities of systems in advance of this practical
activity, so the **process of activism**, of creating projects, itself
**opens up points of critical instability** and **forms lines of
flight** that can **lead to more equitable and resilient
futures**]{.underline}.

[This does not, however, imply that such knowledge leads to mastery and
control]{.underline}. Indeed, a basic comprehension of complex systems
entails realizing that unilateral control is impossible. Unlike humanist
accounts of agency which relegate technics and nature to the status of
Cartesian automata, systems which are teleologically bound to particular
pathways, [**media ecology** contends that agency is a distributed
property, **existing throughout assemblages**, rather than being an
innate quality applying to one particular type of node]{.underline}.
While forms of agency differ between varying types of actor, the
[diverse examples explored in this text have tried to elucidate numerous
ways that nonhuman actants realize differential forms of
agency.]{.underline}

[**Understanding the multiplicity of nonhuman agencies** at play in
technological systems]{.underline} -- those associated with algorithms,
codecs, file formats, operating systems, minerals, metals and energy
supplies -- has been posited as key to understanding ways that these
ensembles, along with humans, [work together to form media
ecologies.]{.underline} Improving our understandings of the media
systems we are entangled with entails comprehending various forms of
nonhuman agency, [how they manifest and what kinds of selection
pressures they apply to the evolution of technical
ensembles]{.underline}. Stiegler's account of the [human as being
fundamentally defined by its **co-evolutionary relationships with
technologies**]{.underline}, which [form an **exteriorized** **mode** of
distributed and **collective memory** is useful here, insofar as it
reminds us that 'we' do not exist outside of our technical support
systems and suggests that the varying agencies which technologies
mobilize produce divergent ethical and political
imperatives]{.underline}. This goes beyond claims that 'technology is
society made durable' (Latour 1990), which [suggests that **society
precedes technology**]{.underline} (which allows the former to endure),
rather than there being a mutually constitutive co-evolution of
technology and society.

### Alt---Digital Socialism

#### Vote negative for movements of digital socialism

**Kwet 21** (Michael Kwet, Yale Univeristy -- Information Society
Project, "People's Tech for People's Power: A Guide to Digital
Self-Defense & Empowerment", *Right2Know Campaign*,
<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3748901>) // EL

Let us begin this chapter with a simple observation: no country will
ever become wealthy when the critical infrastructure powering its
economy is owned and controlled by foreign corporations. South Africa's
modern history arises from a European-led invasion by the Dutch East
India Company, who stole the land and brutally exploited the indigenous
people for profit. Critical infrastructure and resources -- railroads,
mines, industrial equipment, housing, and land -- were dominated by
white settlers at the expense of the African people. White authorities
also waged psychological and conceptual warfare on the population
through the imposition of colonial interpretations of religion, culture,
and political economy. Bantu education sought to instill passivity and
acceptance of race and class-based inequality. Today, US-based
corporations are colonising digital technology. Instead of taking over
the land, they are colonising critical digital infrastructure and human
knowledge. They seek to own the world's knowledge and culture
(intellectual property), the material infrastructure (cloud server
farms, transoceanic cables, and other hardware), the code powering
computers (software), and information about people and nature (data).
Converting knowledge into private property is foundational to their
system of domination. [When Big Tech corporations do share knowledge, it
is done in ways beneficial to themselves. Google and Facebook, for
example, are happy to "open source" some of their artificial
intelligence software (e.g. Tensor Flow and PyTorch) because they use it
to monetise Big Data surveillance.xviii Yet if their access to
surveillance data were shut out by new technologies and privacy laws,
they would close off much of their "open source" technology and increase
the share of proprietary code in the software market. The problem we
face today is digital capitalism and authoritarianism, not simply
surveillance capitalism.]{.underline} As I previously wrote in the Mail
& Guardian, the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) narrative claims Big
Data, intellectual property, centralised clouds, the Internet of Things,
"smart" cities littered with surveillance, automation, algorithmic
decision-making, Big Tech corporations, and surveillance capitalism are
the way of the future. A creation of the ultra-capitalist World Economic
Forum (WEF), the 4IR concept is an elite construct which serves a useful
purpose at the periphery of empire by steering inquiry about tech into
the WEF agenda. Like the colonial missionaries of past, they preach a
new religion, the 4IR, as the saviour of society. Not surprisingly, the
tools they promote are the tools of the masters: corporate ownership,
intellectual property, centralised clouds, Big Data surveillance, the
profit incentive, and private production for the market. This will not
work for the common person. As Audrey Lorde put it, "the master's tools
will never dismantle the master's house". The threat of proprietary
technology -- and the selective sharing of knowledge by corporations --
was captured by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who stated in 2007: Freedom is
an ongoing process, and not an end in itself ... We are not shy to use
the word freedom, and do so in contexts where its importance is not
always recognised. In a digital world, there are many threads to a
hard-won liberty. There are those who take our ideas and lock them up
for business gain. There are those who will take the fruits of the human
mind and lock them up, dishing them out to us in meted amounts for a fee
that locks most of our people out. And there are laws that are reserved
for business reasons and changed to rob society of its own rights \...
To paraphrase Edmund Burke, who said, 'the only thing necessary for the
triumph of those who take away our freedom in the digital world is for
organisations \[like universities\] to do nothing.' But there are
people, like our keynote speakers ... who are not content to do nothing.
Indeed, there is a whole movement that is rapidly gaining momentum
worldwide arising out of the work of people like Free Software
Foundation founder Richard Stallman, creating socially responsible
businesses out of the very freedoms that we are talking about. Free
Software and Open Source, Free and Open Resources for Education, new
ways to create and share cultural artifacts such as music, writing, and
art -- all of these are changing the world for the better.
Unfortunately, intellectuals who believe themselves to be \"critical\"
of Big Tech have formulated a liberal imperialist narrative called the
\"techlash\" that fails to address digital colonialism. These
USEurocentric \"critics\", drawn from elite Western university and media
outlets, ignore the centrality of property and the Free Software
Movement. Much like the Sullivan Principles during apartheid,xix their
solutions offer minor reforms that maintain US interests, such as weak
privacy laws, \"competitive markets\" created through antitrust, and
corporate ownership of the digital ecosystem. The \"techlash\" extends
Francis Fukuyama\'s \"end of history\" to tech, where nothing
fundamentally different can occur other than what we have seen in the
West. [If we are going to create a society that prioritises freedom and
equality, we will have to develop a new framework to restructure the
digital ecosystem.]{.underline} This requires more than the array of
Free Software technologies outlined in this guide. [We must also have
supportive laws, critical education, and a grassroots movement to
counter digital colonialism and replace it with a democratic digital
commons owned and controlled directly by the people. There is no way
around this.]{.underline} Laws like POPIA are designed to safeguard
surveillance capitalism. This can be seen in its provisions that allow
Big Data surveillance to flourish with mild restrictions said to
"protect" your privacy. Under POPIA, exemptions include data processed
for national security, such as "defense or public safety", instances in
which "the public interest in the processing outweighs, to a substantial
degree, any interference with the privacy of the data subject", and
instances where the processing provides "a clear benefit to the data
subject or third party that outweighs ... interference with \[their\]
privacy". The "public interest" includes "national security", "the
prevention, detection and prosecution of offences", "important economic
and financial interests of a public body", and "historical, statistical
or research activity" (as well as the "special importance of the
interest in freedom of expression"). POPIA also allows people to
"consent" to Big Data surveillance through terms and conditions, defined
as "any voluntary, specific and informed expression of will in terms of
which permission is given for the processing of personal information."
Yet we know that nobody can read these terms and conditions, even if
they wanted to. One study showed that the average person would have to
spend about 76 working days per year to read the Terms and Conditions of
the websites they visit. Google South Africa sent me about 20,000 words
of "terms and conditions" covering the Google technologies used in South
African schools. Users can either "consent" to Google's data processing,
or they can't use its technologies at all. Forcing people to endure
surveillance just to visit a website, join a social network, or use a
weather app, on the basis that they "consent" is unjust. Yet POPIA does
not appear to prohibit this "take it or leave it" surveillance society.
Digital capitalism has a business model crisis. It concentrates and
extracts wealth, cedes authoritarian control over digital experiences to
transnational corporations unaccountable to the public, and subjects
users to surveillance, advertising, and manipulation. If it moves to a
"pay-for-ethicaltreatment" model, it will generate class inequality,
especially for the poor who have no disposable income. In a
commons-based system of digital socialism, knowledge is free and open
for all to consume, modify, and share. [Free Software, interoperability,
federated services, and decentralisation tools provide the public with
the means to own and control their experiences. To support the global
commons, production and maintenance of digital technology and culture
could be paid for by the rich through progressive taxation and heavy
taxes on Big Tech corporations. This requires a Tech New Deal that
transforms the digital ecosystem from a profit-seeking enterprise into a
publicly funded global commons. A movement for digital socialism
dovetails with efforts to build an environmentally sustainable global
economy based on wealth redistribution and equality, not limitless
growth]{.underline}. Many of the core technologies powering the digital
revolution were funded by the state, including computers, the internet,
and GPS. The state also supports the education of computer scientists
and engineers. Research and development institutions like the CSIR could
help develop decentralisation technologies like FreedomBox instead of
surveillance systems like Cmore. University researchers could work on
voice assistants like Almond, which does not spy on its users, as they
are doing at Stanford University. [With enough funds from taxes,
talented developers could be awarded comfortable middle-class salaries
to work on public interest technologies, instead of joining exploitative
institutions like Google and Microsoft, who pay researchers a few
million rand per year]{.underline}. As noted in previous chapters,
government policy can require the use of People's Tech in schools,
universities, and the public sector; protect user privacy; and teach
people about tech freedom. But none of this will occur without you.
Technology corporations have concentrated enormous sums of wealth into
the hands of a few, and they will not give it up without a serious
fight. It doesn't help that elected representatives are tempted to
exploit corporate tech for their own surveillance and control. Nhlanhla
Mabaso, a champion of Free Software, headed the Open Source Centre --
since renamed the Meraka Institute -- at the CSIR. ("Meraka" is Sotho
for "open grazing land".) In a research interview, Mabaso told me some
of his colleagues argue the government's Free and Open Source Software
policy preference means "open source is law" in South Africa. Efforts by
Mabaso and his peers once aimed to undermine the power of corporations
like Microsoft from colonising the South African tech ecosystem. Decades
earlier, anti-apartheid activists protested against the use of computers
from tech corporations like IBM to facilitate the apartheid system. They
eventually forced IBM to withdraw its business operations from South
Africa. During the struggle against apartheid education, Zwelakhe Sisulu
asserted: We are not prepared to accept any 'alternative' to Bantu
Education which is imposed from above. This includes American or any
other imperialist alternatives designed to safeguard their selfish
interests in the country, by promoting elitist and divisive ideas and
values which will ensure foreign monopoly exploitation continues. [Only
through democratic institutions and committees could students, parents,
and teachers take control of their own education. "We are fighting for
the right to self-determination in the education sphere as in all other
spheres ... It has become a struggle of the whole community with the
involvement of all sections of the community]{.underline}", Sisulu said.
In the neoapartheid era, a new wave of US tech transnationals are
pushing oppressive products into the country once again. [A People\'s
Tech movement to kick Big Tech out of Africa could form a critical part
of the global protests against the enduring legacy of racism and
colonialism. Activists across the world could unite to form a targeted
boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement centered on Big Tech
corporations and their supporters in the United States]{.underline}.
South African communities are tasked to build a digital ecosystem that
the people own and control, so they are not subjects of American or any
other imperialist powers[. People's Tech for People's Power, a holistic
solution based on a Free and Open Source technology commons, socialist
legal solutions, people\'s education, subsidies for public interest
technology, and a vigorous grassroots movement, is urgently needed to
avert disaster and build a truly democratic and egalitarian
society.]{.underline}

### Alt---Governable Stacks

#### Vote negative to pursue insurgent governable stacks that [reassemble]{.underline} the technical layers of the cybernetic episteme in ways that [fractally spill up]{.underline} to align with radical struggles across the globe. 

**Schneider, 22**---assistant professor of media studies at the
University of Colorado Boulder (Nathan, "Governable Stacks against
Digital Colonialism," tripleC 20 (1): 19-36, 2022, dml)

The spinning wheel remains a cipher and a site of conflict, an everyday
technology summoned to a contest over the meaning of democracy. Despite
having political ties with Gandhi's assassin, the Hindu nationalist
prime minister Narendra Modi promotes homespun cloth and has done
photo-ops operating a spinning wheel. Modi has meanwhile shuttered
boards that gave artisans a voice in policy under the slogan "Minimum
Government and Maximum Governance" (Vincent 2020). The [technology
itself does not guarantee self-governance]{.underline}, [but it can be
the **symbolic base** from which **ever-enlarging acts** of
self-governance **defeat an empire**]{.underline}.

In the spirit of the technological cipher [I propose the pursuit
of]{.underline} "**[governable stacks]{.underline}**": [an orientation
toward **ungovernable organising** under digital
colonialism]{.underline}.

The geek-colloquial meaning of stack, in the most relevant sense, is a
set of interoperating hardware and software. Benjamin H. Bratton (2016,
xvii) goes further, describing [the stack as]{.underline} "[a new
architecture for how we divide the world into sovereign
spaces]{.underline}". Its layers [come with **intersecting relations**
of dependency]{.underline}, [along with **emergent
freedoms**]{.underline}. [A stack might include all that enables one to
use a]{.underline} social media [service]{.underline}, for instance:
[the **server farms**]{.underline}, [the **corporation**]{.underline}
that owns them, [its **investors**]{.underline}, [the
**software**]{.underline} the servers run on, [the]{.underline} secret
**[algorithms]{.underline}** that analyse one's data, [the **mobile
device**]{.underline}, its accelerometer sending biometric data to the
server farm, [the **network provider**]{.underline}, [the backdoor
access for **law enforcement**]{.underline}, and so on. The layers of a
stack might further include [the **sun** or **coal** powering
it]{.underline}, [the **wars** fuelled by rare-earth
mining]{.underline}, [and the **mythologies** and **rituals** that
dictate what people in it will tolerate]{.underline}. Each layer is in
fact multiple layers, and layers build on each other.

Before governable stacks were the topic of this article, they were an
experience for me, particularly through an organisation in which I have
been an anecdotal participantobserver for a decade. **[May
First]{.underline}** Movement Technology (mayfirst.coop) is a
cooperative that [provides **web hosting**]{.underline}, **[cloud
services]{.underline}**, [and **public education** for]{.underline} a
850-strong membership composed largely of [activist
organisations]{.underline} in the United States and Mexico (Lopez et al.
2007). Through [the tools]{.underline} May First offers, I have been
able to [move]{.underline} much of my daily [computing **away** from
companies that **surveil** and **extract** into]{.underline} servers I
co-own and govern, running **[commons-based software]{.underline}**. I
have formed relationships with the people who maintain these services
and participated in decision-making over bilingual conference calls and
online ballots. I learn about new tools from fellow members, and we
sponsor events that teach people outside our membership how to challenge
the power of big tech in their lives and their communities. Akin to the
slow food movement, [this is **slow computing**]{.underline} (Schneider
2015), its pace [measured not by bandwidth or processing speed but by
the attention to the **social dimensions** of everyday
practice]{.underline}.

While Silicon Valley elites escape to phone-free retreats (Marantz 2019)
and agonise about their children's exposure to screens (Bowles 2018),
May First offers no such "abhorrence of machinery" (Chaplin 1966, 373).
[It **does not accept the false choice** between]{.underline} addictive,
[**surveillance-addled apps** and a **fantasy of**]{.underline}
returning to **[some blissful innocence]{.underline}**. Instead,
[members share technologies that **do what they need** and that they can
**reasonably control**]{.underline}. [These technologies]{.underline},
[and the self-governance we surround them with]{.underline}, [are our
stack]{.underline}. May First does not demand that you 'learn to code',
or otherwise trade traditional knowledge for digital expertise. For me,
[being part of a governable stack]{.underline} like May First
[has]{.underline} **[unlocked political possibilities]{.underline}**.
[The experience motivated years of working to build governable stacks
elsewhere]{.underline}, because I know that it can be done. I poured
myself into [developing alternative ownership models like]{.underline}
"**[platform cooperatives]{.underline}**" (Schneider 2018)
[and]{.underline} "**[exit to community]{.underline}**" (Mannan and
Schneider 2021) [that are **better suited** to making tech
governable]{.underline}. With time, ungovernable stacks have come to
feel like foreign lands. I may use them, but they never feel like home.

[Governable stacks are cyborg assemblages of inter-operating
technology]{.underline}, [in symbiosis with human
relationships]{.underline} (Haraway 1991; Puar 2012). [Those
relationships]{.underline} [organise power]{.underline}, [in
**partnership** with the technology more than through **domination**
over it]{.underline}. [We learn with each other]{.underline}, [and we
learn with the machines]{.underline}, which take on life of their own --
through their own intelligence, or that which we affectionately project
onto them. In the sense of Grace Lee and Jimmy Boggs's dialectical
humanism, [governable stacks]{.underline} [invite the people who use
them to **change their relationship** with technologies]{.underline},
[to **imagine different sorts** of technologies]{.underline}, [and to be
**changed themselves**]{.underline}.

[Perhaps governability can be achieved by **reconfiguring** tools that
already exist]{.underline}; [perhaps it is necessary to **make new
ones**]{.underline}. Tiziana Terranova (2014), who has proposed the
complementary idea of a "red stack", writes that [insurgent stacks
become]{.underline} "[new platforms through a **crafty bricolage** of
existing technologies]{.underline}, the enactment of new subjectivities
through a detournement of widespread social media literacy". Older
technologies may be better suited to this than newer ones (Maxigas and
Latzko-Toth 2020). [Even the colonial platforms can be
**repurposed**]{.underline} -- as the Algerian writer Kateb Yacine said
of the French language -- [as **spoils of war**]{.underline}. [The
lifeblood of the governable stack is not any claim to innovation but the
self-governance that flows through it]{.underline}. What emerges from
there is the point.

The **[Guifi.net]{.underline}** community Internet network in Catalonia
(guifi.net) [became the condition of possibility for a suite
of]{.underline} "**[community cloud]{.underline}**"
[services]{.underline} deployed through it (Selimi et al. 2015).
**[FairTEC]{.underline}** (fairtec.io) [combines]{.underline} into one
product [a stack of preexisting services across]{.underline} three
[European countries]{.underline}: a sustainably manufactured smartphone,
a non-commercial operating system, a cooperative telecom, and a
cooperative phone rental company. The developers of the
**[CommonsCloud]{.underline}** (commonscloud.coop) [see their shared
technology as only one layer of a larger community stack]{.underline},
[which also includes]{.underline} "**[social]{.underline}**"
[and]{.underline} "**[discursive]{.underline}**" [layers]{.underline} --
the context and substance of their self-governance. Layers form over
time, too. [Governable stacks of the past lurk in the archaeology of
colonial systems through legacies like **Indymedia**]{.underline}, an
activist social network whose participatory servers and software
prefigured the corporate "Web 2.0" (Pickard 2006). Indymedia itself drew
from decades of organising among activist communityradio stations,
particularly in Latin America (Ruiz Martinez 2021). [There can be **no
one governable stack**]{.underline} -- [only **many**]{.underline},
[whose archipelagos of commoning **enable each other** and **give rise
to more**]{.underline}.

Technologists seeking alternative visions have often gravitated to the
Free Software and Open Source movements, which employ creative licensing
to enable the sharing of accessible and modifiable code. These movements
have been successful in terms of the sheer volume of widely used
software in their commons. But their emphasis on the freedoms of
individual users, as well as of corporations, has privileged those with
the technical know-how to take advantage. The software commons has
spawned operating systems that fly in military jets and databases that
aid in the imprisonment of asylum seekers (Ehmke 2020). In the name of
freedom, too, developers have harboured sexism and other forms of
exclusionary culture (SSL Nagbot 2016). Governable stacks should
prioritise community accountability alongside individual freedom.

[Another emerging strategy for challenging digital colonialism has come
from **within**]{.underline}. [Employees]{.underline} at Silicon Valley
giants [have achieved reforms by organising against certain ethical
outrages at their workplaces]{.underline} (Tarnoff 2020). [Yet there are
**limits** to what these campaigns are likely to achieve]{.underline},
[since these]{.underline} workers are invested -- often literally,
through stock options -- in the basic business models of their
employers. Employees' actions [can present the impression that their
protest **cleanses** the colonial tools they produce]{.underline}.
[Governable stacks do not seek merely to **improve the
occupier**]{.underline}. "Decolonization is not an 'and'", as Tuck and
Yang (2012) put it. "It is an elsewhere" (36).

Experiences with governable stacks introduce us to possible elsewheres.
The spinning wheel was an elsewhere, the invention of a democratic
India. May First Movement Technology is an elsewhere for its members,
who in turn become part of its learning and evolving. Collectives,
families, and movements can assemble and adjust their stacks over time,
wherever possible seeking to make their technological lives ever more
governable. I next turn to strategies to guide the process of doing so.

5\. Governable Strategy

May First is infinitesimally small by the standards of the tech economy.
"Goldman Sachs doesn't care if you're raising chickens", as the
political theorist Jodi Dean (2011) has said. It's a reminder for anyone
tempted to see too much potential in personal practices, technological
or otherwise. But spinning wheels are small, too, and they helped drive
away the British Empire.

adrienne maree brown (2017) credits Grace Lee Boggs for helping her see
that (her emphasis) "[what we practice at the small scale **sets the
patterns** for the **whole system**]{.underline}". She explains this in
a chapter called "Fractals", which recalls how she shifted her activism
to better reflect her political values in daily practice. [Fractals are
mathematical phenomena]{.underline}, frequent in nature, [whose patterns
at smaller scales **repeat** at larger scales]{.underline}. They are
appealing and widely used as a metaphor, being both mathematically
precise in theory and conveniently vague when applied to human affairs.
Those like brown and Boggs who apply fractal-talk to politics exercise a
kind of faith. To make good on that faith, there must some linkage, some
strategy, that connects self-governance from the scale of small
communities to the larger societies those community seek to transform.
[There was a fractal in the **free maroons of Saint-Domingue** who
stormed down from their mountains into combat with French troops so the
whole island could be free]{.underline}.

[There was a fractal in]{.underline} the spinning wheel on [the **Indian
National Congress** flag]{.underline}, [extending from a traditional
practice to an eventual industrial policy]{.underline}. These chickens
came to roost because they were part of a strategy that involved
organised confrontation with colonial power. [Self-governing became a
**challenge**]{.underline}, [a **threat**]{.underline}. In **[even small
experiments]{.underline}**, governable stacks [can begin to
**normalise** the otherwise elusive fact that **better ways of
organising technology** are possible]{.underline}. [Carefully chosen
practices **sever habits of dependency** on the systems we seek to
resist]{.underline}.

It is an uncomfortable matter of fact that nowhere has been so
successful a counterweight to the power of Silicon Valley as China. The
country has not only barred certain data-colonising companies with its
'Great Firewall' but has cultivated comparably ubiquitous Internet
firms, using comparably invasive colonial practices to produce platforms
that are at once hyper-capitalist and dominated by state interests (Chu
2017; Hong 2017). And yet China's policy of sovereignty shows that
dependence on hostile stacks is not inevitable.

Rather than trading one colonial power for another, [**Western Europe**
has sought a high road in demanding **privacy regulations** and
investments in **commons-based technology**]{.underline} (Lemley 2020).
[Projects such as the **Sovereign Cloud Stack**]{.underline}
(scs.community) [seek to supplant reliance on corporate walled gardens
with **globally replicable**]{.underline}, **[locally deployed
tools]{.underline}**. [Several]{.underline} European [governments have
adopted and funded **free/open-source software**]{.underline} like the
Matrix (matrix.org) messaging protocol and NextCloud (nextcloud.com), a
file-sharing platform. Countries far from the power centres, like Uganda
and Lebanon, have experimented with imposing taxes on the use of foreign
social media (Boxell and Steinert-Threlkeld 2019). [Although such
efforts have been widely perceived as acts of repression more than
solidarity]{.underline}, [similar policies could be used for **different
goals**]{.underline}. Echoing the Cold War-era Non-Aligned Movement
among countries caught between the United States and the Soviet Union,
[some have been calling for a]{.underline} "**[digital non-aligned
movement]{.underline}**" [that asserts many diverse
sovereignties]{.underline} against the duelling forces of Silicon Valley
and Shenzhen (Freuler 2020; Mejias 2020).

**[Sovereignty need not be solely the purview of nation
states]{.underline}**. [The discourse of digital sovereignty has been
particularly important among **indigenous communities** whose members
are used to seeing their pre-digital sovereignty effaced]{.underline};
[they have developed **governable stack-layers** such as **tribal
broadband lines**]{.underline} (Blackwater 2020),
**[cryptocurrencies]{.underline}** (Tekobbe and McKnight 2016), **[data
governance]{.underline}** (Carroll et al. 2020), [and **linguistic
autonomy**]{.underline} (Pinto 2018). Amelia Winger-Bearskin (2020)
draws on the Haudenosaunee practice of wampum agreements to propose
"**[ethical dependencies]{.underline}**" in software; these [would
encode and enforce certain commitments **up** and **down the
stack**]{.underline}. [Laying claim to collective
sovereignty]{.underline} is central to such practices. Glen Sean
Coulthard (2014) [**challenges** the]{.underline} "**[colonial politics
of recognition]{.underline}**" -- [when people accept their
**colonisers' definition** of their sovereignty]{.underline}, [rather
than their **own**]{.underline} -- [to insist on **more autonomous
forms** of self-determination]{.underline}. He describes how tribal
nations can produce sovereignty through "community-scale activities"
such as cooperatives and assemblies in everyday life (68). The
indigenous organiser Berta Cáceres, before her murder by Honduran
paramilitaries, denounced the pseudo-democracy of political
representatives but affirmed the "decisive" democracy possible through
poor people's movements (Castellanos and Pine 2020).

[Sovereignty can occur at levels ranging from the **network backbone**
to **last-mile connections**]{.underline}, [up through the **hardware**
and **software** of devices]{.underline}, [to the **collaboration
tools** in the cloud]{.underline}. [Sovereignty looks like a
**user-owned cooperative** or a **city providing
connectivity**]{.underline}, [or like **Douglass**]{.underline}
(douglass.io), an operating system whose apps take their names from
icons of Black liberation. The tech publication The Markup has paid
[a]{.underline} "**[privacy tax]{.underline}**" by developing its own
software that protects user data rather than adopting the standard
surveillance-based offerings (Angwin 2020). For **[Archive of Our
Own]{.underline}** (archiveofourown.org), a fan-run fandom repository,
sovereignty puts creators in control of how they publish and protects
their work against copyright overreach. [What makes technology sovereign
is when its stewards are the **people** who depend on it]{.underline},
[**protected** from outside control]{.underline} by any legal or
extra-legal means available. [The data]{.underline}, [the
algorithms]{.underline}, [and the interfaces are **for** their
users]{.underline}, [rather than acting surreptitiously **against**
them]{.underline}.

5.2. Democracy

[The other side]{.underline} of sovereignty [is participatory
democracy]{.underline} -- its guarantor and its everyday practice. Here
[we **resist** the temptation of **autocratic vanguardism** by designing
governable stacks to be **accountable** and **alive**]{.underline}. [The
style of democracy may be that of the **Debian operating
system**]{.underline}, [a constitutional republic of coders]{.underline}
(debian.org/devel/constitution), [or like the **Ethical Source
Movement's vision** of many collectives deciding on the ethical limits
of how their software can be used]{.underline} (ethicalsource.dev).
[Digital democracy is beginning to have dedicated tools]{.underline} --
[from smaller-group decisions on **Loomio**]{.underline} (loomio.org)
[to the scale of cities or countries through **Barcelona's
Decidim**]{.underline} (decidim.org) [or **Polis**]{.underline}
(pol.is), which is employed [by]{.underline} the government of
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** (Stempeck 2020). [Platform cooperatives
practice democracy at the level of the company]{.underline}, [such as at
**Stocksy**]{.underline} United (stocksy.com), co-owned by artists in
dozens of countries (Schneider 2018). [On a network scale]{.underline},
the federated social network [**Mastodon** was able to counteract an
incursion by]{.underline} the alt-right platform **[Gab]{.underline}**,
[as it did earlier with]{.underline} **[I]{.underline}**slamic
**[S]{.underline}**tate accounts -- [through self-organised
activity]{.underline} by server administrators and app developers
(Caelin 2020). [Countering hate speech doesn't need to depend on the
might of a **global monopoly**]{.underline}; [it can be **tangible** and
**empowering**]{.underline}.

[Practices of local democracy from the Global South have been migrating
into **governable online tools**]{.underline}. [Participatory budgeting
practices originating from **Porto Alegre**]{.underline}, Brazil
(Cabannes 2004), [have appeared in]{.underline} apps like
**[Cobudget]{.underline}** (cobudget.co) [and **Decidim**]{.underline}.
A founder of an experimental political party in Argentina, **[Partido
Red]{.underline}**, [has applied the same logic]{.underline} of "liquid
democracy" [to a blockchain-based governance platform]{.underline},
**[Democracy Earth]{.underline}** (democracy.earth). **[Mexico
City's]{.underline}** 2016 [exercise in crowdsourcing its constitution
has]{.underline} been studied as [a **model around the
world**]{.underline}.

[Digital democracy has the potential to evolve **rapidly** and
**creatively**]{.underline}. [People can participate in **far more
rapid** and **fine-grained ways** than was possible when the prevailing
regimes of corporate and state governance first appeared]{.underline}.
Organisational [designs that work well could become part of a
**governance commons**]{.underline}, [enabling other groups to
**adopt**]{.underline}, **[adapt]{.underline}**, [and **share** them
back into the common pool]{.underline} (Schneider et al. 2021). In this
way, [small-scale accountability can **spread**]{.underline}, [and it
can creep into **larger** and **larger kinds** of
communities]{.underline}, [demonstrating that colonial control was
**never necessary**]{.underline}. **[The more we demand and practice the
arts of self-governing]{.underline}**, **[the harder we are for someone
else to govern]{.underline}**.

5.3. Insurgency

The spinning wheel stood for household autonomy, but it was also
defiance against British rule. [Governable stacks must be]{.underline}
similarly **[insurgent]{.underline}**. [Some of the earliest online
social media emerged through **Indymedia's coverage** of anti-capitalist
protests]{.underline}. [**Twitter** has its roots in technology for
coordinating street protests]{.underline} (Costanza-Chock 2020, Chapter
3). [While investors and accelerators receive frequent credit for
innovation]{.underline}, [insurgency is **just as much** a source of
it]{.underline}.

[Insurgency might mean challenging government subpoenas of member
data]{.underline}, [as **May First** has done]{.underline}, [or
facilitating leaks about abuses of power]{.underline}. [Resistance might
take the form of what the **Catalan Integral Cooperative**
calls]{.underline} "**[economic disobedience]{.underline}**"
(cooperativa.cat/economic-disobedience), [which includes refusing to pay
unjust taxes or interest]{.underline}. [Insurgents might choose not to
submit the data of a friendship to the social graphs of colonial
platforms]{.underline}, [or to actively deceive those
platforms]{.underline}, [just as the **Tor** network]{.underline}
(torproject.org) [disguises its users' locations]{.underline}. [Like
**Copwatch** groups or the **Driver's Seat Cooperative**]{.underline}
(driversseat.sco), [insurgents can do data collection on the
colonisers]{.underline}, **[sousveillance from below]{.underline}**
(Browne 2015).

To the extent that establishing the expansionist, slaveholding republic
of the United States was also an anticolonial conflict, it relied on
self-governance as resistance. The colonists organised through a
Continental Congress, which extracted lessons from the Haudenosaunee
nations -- yes to confederation, no to matriarchal authority -- to
prefigure a future government. After independence, Alexis de Tocqueville
(1840/2006) observed how the flourishing of civic associations energised
the politics of the fledgling republic. Successful poor people's
struggles against the country's wealthy elites, from the 19th-century
Populists (Goodwyn 1978) to the 20th-century movements for Black power
(Nembhard 2014), grew out of tangible collective organising in labour
unions and cooperatives.

[Insurgents might use colonial platforms for **education** and
**organising**]{.underline}. [They might **spread viral messages** and
**enjoy themselves**]{.underline}. [But if they have **governable
stacks** to go back to]{.underline}, [they are **more than just
subjects**]{.underline}. [They are **maroons**]{.underline}, [with
**swamps** and **forests** of their own]{.underline}.

### Alt---Radical Nonpreference

#### We must turn to the question of the dream in politics and the question of politics in dreaming. The alternative is [radical nonpreference]{.underline} -- a radical formulation of subjectivity that dwells in the gap between [individualism and individualization]{.underline} to create new collectivites and embrace the [contingency]{.underline} of the world.

**Gray and Eloff, 22**---School of Philosophy at North-West University
(Chantelle and Aragorn, "Fabulation in a Time of Algorithmic Ecology:
Making the Future Possible Again," *Technology, Urban Space and the
Networked Community*, Chapter 5, 105-133, SpringerLink, dml) //ansel
recut \[pharmakon=something which is both poison and cure
simultaneously\]

[The answer to our problems does not lie in primitivism or any other
return to a (mythical) better past. [We are here; we need to find ways
to deal]{.mark} with now if we are to rescue the future]{.underline}.
[The answer, equally, does not solely lie in reform. Rather, we need to
ask what we want our societies to look like]{.underline}---[and here we
can look to the past for some ideas without returning to
it]{.underline}. **[In short, [we need to foster new forms of
collectivity in the maze of individualism]{.mark} and
individualisation]{.underline}**. [This requires radical new
formulations of subjectivity that take into account our contemporary
situation. Like Bartleby, it might consist of a preference not to, which
is neither refusal nor acceptance: it simply "posits an
impossibility]{.underline}" (Deleuze 1997, 71). **[[This]{.mark}
impossibility or [nonpreference produces a tension]{.mark}, an ambiguity
[that creates a path for escaping]{.mark} the [neurosis]{.mark} of the
world]{.underline}**. That is, [the little fissure it creates gives way
to a mapping of trajectories away from subjugated groups and towards new
types of group subjects that do not merely concede to the
present]{.underline}, [either in terms of an eschatology of
techno-singularitarianism or hikimomori-style withdrawal]{.underline}.
For Guattari, [[this involves processes]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
resingularisation, where singularisation refers to [a self-organizing
process that]{.mark} at its most basic level [concerns bringing
together]{.mark} ensembles of diverse components]{.underline}
(material/semiotic; individual/collective), that is,
[[assemblages]{.mark} ... that deploy their own intrinsic
references]{.underline} (inventing relations with the outside as well[),
[and the analysis of their effects]{.mark}]{.underline} (especially
transformations) [[on the formation of subjectivity]{.mark} beyond the
individuated subject and prefabricated versions of
~~him/her~~]{.underline}. \[them\](Genosko 2001, 129)

[Far from the homophile groups of online life, [this requires]{.mark},
as Guattari foresaw, [an injection of heterogeneity]{.mark} where
individuals can be confronted with ideas dissimilar from their own and
opportunities to talk this through rather than reactively cancelling 27
someone]{.underline}. [It requires forms of offline life that nurture
transgenerational, intergenerational, interpersonal, personal and
pre-personal long-circuits in order to reach the Neganthropocene, a
place of dreams]{.underline}. As Stiegler puts it: [we must turn to the
question of the dream in politics and the question of the politics of
dreaming---where dreams would be the resource of any neganthropogenesis,
that is, any exosomatic organogenesis such that it would preserve its
future by maintaining its noetic capacity]{.underline}. (Stiegler 2019,
162)

[**[These new social practices]{.mark}** of liberation---yes, **[of
dreaming---cannot be based on new hierarchical
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Instead, one of the main goals needs
to be the creation of new alliances, a transversal politics, "that
confers to these initiatives a character of living subjectivation and
irreplaceable experience, that 'is worth being lived', that 'gives
meaning to life']{.underline}" (Guattari and Negri 2010, 125). In short,
we are looking for health. Interestingly, for Deleuze and Guattari, as
for Nietzsche before them, [health is not opposed to illness; rather it
is the "immanent process whereby illness brings about its own
autocritique and self-overcoming]{.underline}" (Tynan 2010, 155). [The
illness of our time therefore needs to be transmuted in order to create
new ways of living again]{.underline}---and this is of course the
schizoanalytic practice. [Th[e aim is to see]{.underline} ]{.mark}[our
current [algorithmic articulations as a
pharmakon]{.mark}]{.underline}---that, precisely, is Bartleby's stance.
[It is a productive paradox, [an affirmation of life and the future,
rather than a negation of it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Importantly, though,
it is only with the pharmakon that knowledge takes care of the pharmakon
... **the whole manifold of life-knowledge---which passes through
rituals as well as habitus, trades and forms of worship** \[cultes\]
that are found in any society insofar as it consists in a social
cohesion that is a collective individuation, cultivating, through these
always diverse pathways, the organic and organological solidarity in
which it consists]{.underline}. (Stiegler 2019, 224)

[[The]{.mark} individualist, individualising [societies we]{.mark}
currently [find ourselves in]{.mark} [have]{.mark} not only
[lost]{.mark} their means of tertiary protention, but [a memory of what
a society is and can be]{.mark}]{.underline}: [that which allows the
development and co-creation of individual and social
freedom]{.underline}; [where material goods are produced in order to
meet the physical needs of everyone in a society, rather than satisfy
the insatiable requirements of capitalism]{.underline}; [where free and
equal social relationships are fostered so that people can flourish
mentally and emotionally and, in turn, develop their ethical and
creative capacities.28 If this is the basis of our society, [algorithms
would have a very different function]{.mark} and that, we hold, is more
important than reform.]{.underline}

### Framework---Epistemology Key---cybersecurity

#### Cybersecurity is an assemblage of knowledge and power. Their interpretation functions as [cybernetic obfuscation]{.underline} to hide its operations.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko 2019**---associate professor of
information and media studies at the University of Western Ontario;
assistant professor of communication at Simon Fraser University (Nick
and Svitlana, *Cyberwar and Revolution: Digital Subterfuge in Global
Capitalism*) //ansel

[These definitional debates are not abstract semantic
disputes]{.underline}. As Robert Kaiser (2015) argues, since 2000,
[**[cyberwar]{.mark}** has named **[an emergent "knowledge power
assemblage]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[," [mobilizing institutional
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**[, lavish budgets, and lucrative career
paths]{.underline}. [**[It has become the core of a discursive
"resonance machine," with its own "catalyzing agents,]{.mark}**"
**"shimmering points" of elaboration, refinement and subtle
discrimination, and "centers of calculation," focused around the
materialization of a "new policy object**]{.underline}" (Kaiser 2015,
11--20). In 2009, after tortuous bureaucratic infighting between
competing governmental departments and military agencies, **[[the
Pentagon created a]{.underline} [Cyber Command to conduct
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in a "cyberdomain" now deemed as
important as land, sea, air, and space]{.underline}. This is a logic
being duplicated within national security states around the world.
[**The observation that cyberwar has now become extremely handy for
acquiring big funds for research and militarization** (Rid 2013) is
true, but, with a self-validating circularity, the cyberwar apparatuses
built on this promotional discourse not only speak but also prepare and
act]{.underline}. [**[Public knowledge of]{.mark}** these **[cyberwar
acts is]{.mark}**, however, limited and **[distorted]{.mark}**; if
**[the new cyberwar complexes are]{.mark}** in one way new
"**[assemblages of knowledge and power]{.mark}**," [**they are also
assemblages of power, nonknowledge and antiknowledge**, **military
factories of ignorance**]{.mark} and obfuscation. War always involves
secrets, but **[cyberwars are]{.mark}** exceptionally **[deeply
cloaked]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Michael Kenney (2015, 117) observes,
"[**[cyber-warfare is]{.mark}** typically **[a covert form of
statecraft]{.mark}**. Herein lies much of \[its\] utility as a weapon:
states can attack their adversaries without declaring war against them."
**If there is one cyberwar cliché more common than "you may not be
interested in cyberwar," it is a redo of Clausewitz's "fog of war" as
"fog of cyberwar**]{.underline}**"** (Valeriano and Maness 2012;
Canabarro and Borne 2013; Rantapelkonen and Salminen 2013). [**[Digital
war is a veritable fog machine]{.mark}**, because [operations
are]{.mark} usually [conducted covertly]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} often [intended to confuse]{.mark}; hacks are hidden from
view and, when discovered, are laden with misdirection; signals
intelligence implodes into infoglut]{.underline}. Apparently
incriminating traces of hacking tools left at the site of a digital
breach may be intentional false flags and what looks like a singular
exploit actually a chain of attacks by different actors "piling on" to a
discovered system vulnerability. Is a hacking exploit that leaves as a
signature the name of the founder of the Soviet secret service a
careless, or cavalier, disclosure of national responsibility---or a
blatant red herring? As of today, it can be said that all, or nearly
all, obvious indicators pointing to a potential responsible party, such
as time, specifics of code, politics or other motifs, and cybertactics,
can be manufactured to point in a wrong direction. [In investigating
cyberwar, conspiracy theory is methodologically mandatory. However, not
only attribution of attacks but also [**the distinction between attacks
and accidents becomes highly problematic**; **"fog of war"
(**]{.mark}**ignorance[) and "friction of war" (]{.mark}mishap[)
intermingle]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Cyberwar]{.underline}**
]{.mark}[**thus [tends to "obliterating proof]{.mark}** " (Filiol 2011,
260), sometimes **[by producing too many proofs]{.mark},** "incessant
**[fluctuations" of proofs]{.mark}**, to use Claude Shannon's phrase for
noise, or, in the words of W. Ross Ashby (\[1963\] 1966), "**variety
\[that\] can destroy variety**]{.underline}."

Cybersecurity experts argue that, given sufficient time, it is indeed
possible to make a reasonable determination of responsibility for
cyberattacks. This process can involve analyzing technical details, such
as the design of malware payload or "IP addresses, email addresses,
domain names, and small pieces of text" used in the attack; comparing
the modus operandi of hackers with the known profiles gathered from
other cases; and assessing the likely reasons for an intrusion---but
even then, [verification is a matter of degree of certainty rather than
a binary yes or no answer]{.underline} (Rid and Buchanan 2016[). In this
book, we often necessarily rely on such "balance of probability"
interpretations, but with an awareness that]{.underline} [**[cyberwar is
a weaponization of information that always threatens to destroy
truth]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is, as Justin Joque (2018, "Foreword")
writes, **[[a force of "machinic deconstruction" that constantly
threatens "to sweep away any belief in security.]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
We write also knowing that, in "a world where it is not clear who is
hacking whom" (Ridgeway 2017), the attribution of cyberwar activity can
itself become a tactic setting up an adversary for sanctions and
retaliation. [Academic interpretation, too, can be weaponized; those who
stare into the abyss of cyberwar soon find it staring back at
them.]{.underline}

### Framework---Gaming Bad

#### Abstracting the managerialism of the game is important to high school debate -- the autonomy, portable skills, and perspective of debaters are at risk -- reject their technocratic managerialism hidden under technology terminology and game-like features

Christo **Sims, 20**. Associate Professor in the Department of
Communication and an Affiliated Faculty member in Science Studies and
Ethnic Studies at the University of California, San Diego. His most
recent book, *Disruptive fixation: school reform and the pitfalls of
techno-idealism* (Princeton University Press, 2017), is the winner of
the 2018 Best Book Award from the Communication, Information Technology,
and Media Sociology section of the American Sociological Association.
"Pedagogic Fixation." *The digital age and its discontents: Critical
reflections in education*, Chapter 10, 196-199. //GJ

**[Repairing Idealism]{.underline}**

[Part of the answer to the question I just posed has to do with the
occluding effects of fixations]{.underline}. As I have been arguing,
[reformers tend to fix their imagination and attention on aspects of the
world they can foreseeably transform in **morally sanctified ways** with
their seemingly innovative remedies; correspondingly, they tend to
overlook and take for granted whatever they cannot so easily control and
transform with these newly available means]{.underline}. As we have
seen, the school's designers did not have the power to change many of
the factors that structured canonical pedagogic practices. The state and
[the D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [E]{.underline}ducation,
rather than the school's designers, [determined much of the curriculum,
as well as funding for student--teacher ratios, the allocation of space
and many other resource provisions]{.underline}. The built environments
that they inhabited---consisting of multiple similar classrooms, each of
which had been designed for a single educator teaching several dozen
students---were inherited and built with canonical models of schooling
in mind. [Additionally, the school had to be able to interoperate with
other schools]{.underline} in the broader New York City schooling
system, as well as with colleges and universities. [Part of its mandate
involved receiving and delivering students in age-graded cohorts and
producing **standardized outcome metrics** that made students and
educators legible, hence differentiable, in processes of social
selection and managerial oversight that extended beyond the space of the
school]{.underline}. [Reformers]{.underline} and educators [had to
comport themselves to these more entrenched strictures]{.underline}, and
they deliberated how to do so, but reformers, in particular, [did not
tend to see such practices as central to what their project was all
about.]{.underline}

How so?

For one, despite their professed student-centred ethos, more widespread
and [deeply sedimented ideological edifices about age relations and
developmental temporalities helped reformers and educators downplay
aspects of their pedagogic practices that were **particularly at odds
with their ideals**]{.underline}. As sociologists of childhood and youth
have documented, [modernist practices of disciplining and controlling
children and young people are legitimized]{.underline}, and hence often
taken for granted, in part [because of a more general tendency among
adults to infantilize children and young people, a tendency that emerged
alongside broader historical changes in the social and cultural
organization of age relations]{.underline} (Zelizer 1985; Qvortrup 1994;
James, Jenks & Prout 1998; Corsaro 2005[). **Figuring children as
particularly underdeveloped** and vulnerable is especially common in
figured worlds that take the care and development of children and young
people as their raison d'être. There were too many of these
infantilizing practices to enumerate]{.underline}, but the reformer's
previous [comment that the students couldn't handle recess in the gym is
one such example]{.underline}. Additionally, some [educators routinely
addressed the students with labels that positioned them as
immature]{.underline} and inexperienced because of their age---[terms
such as boys and girls]{.underline}---and one educator even reminded the
students that they were being [addressed with these terms because they
had not yet proven themselves worthy of a more mature and autonomous
status]{.underline}. More commonly, educators routinely subjected
students to didactic lessons on topics that students were presumed not
to know, but were, in fact, quite knowledgeable about. One such episode
was a school-wide assembly in which educators made students perform
small skits in which they acted out norms for polite social etiquette,
such as how to hold the door open for someone and how to acknowledge the
act with the phrase 'thank you'. [Students already knew about these
normative conventions, even if they sometimes did not enact them, in
part, I believe, to demonstrate their autonomy from adult-imposed
strictures]{.underline}. As we will see in the next chapter, these sorts
of infantilizing practices produce conditions for oppositional
behaviour, especially for subordinates who can gain status among their
peers by demonstrating resistance to supervisory power.5

Additionally, experienced [reformers and educators routinely made a
distinction between practices of control and practices of care, the
former of which they classified as classroom management and the latter
of which they classified as pedagogical or learning activities. In
practice, **classroom management and pedagogic practices were one and
the same**, with purportedly caring pedagogic practices taking forms
that helped sustain authorities' control in crowded conditions. Yet,
experienced reformers and educators tended to classify management
practices as a **separate but necessary precondition** for administering
pedagogic practices]{.underline}, and the latter was widely seen as
beneficial for all students and hence as morally caring. For experienced
reformers and educators, classroom-management practices seemed to be
understood as a necessary, sometimes ugly, but also fairly mundane
aspect of being a professional educator. And, if anything, [experienced
reformers and educators seemed to see those of us who were newer to
their figured worlds---such as reformers who came **from the worlds of
technology design**, as well as myself---as a bit
**naïve**]{.underline}. As I spent more and more time in the school, [I
often got the sense that learning how to discipline and control students
was treated by experienced educators as a sort of **sub rosa aspect of
being an experienced member** of their figured world]{.underline}.
Indeed, new reformers and educators became more experienced old-timers
in part by learning to make the distinction between classroom management
and pedagogic practices, as well as by learning how to be comfortable
exercising power over young people. Perhaps recalling their own
experiences as novice teachers and knowing that I was new to middle
school as an adult, [several of the experienced educators would make
comments to me such as, 'Teaching is crazy, right?' after I witnessed an
educator deploy a variety of rather domineering disciplinary techniques
in an attempt to corral and pacify students. When I agreed, I felt as if
**I was beginning to be let in**to their club]{.underline}, in part by
treating the exercise of power over young people as a normal, and even
skillful, aspect of being an experienced educator.

While less-experienced reformers seemed to share my sense that many of
these disciplinary practices were odd, if not unsettling, [the division
of labour in the philanthropic intervention also made it easier for
these reformers to downplay and overlook the extent to which their
project involved exercising coercive and disciplinary techniques on
those it was designed to help.]{.underline} At the Downtown School,
[there was a fairly sharp and spatialized **division of labour between
the people who designed** and supported the intervention **and those who
implemented it**]{.underline}. By and large, the school's design team
spent little time managing everyday life at the school, even though they
held considerable power over those who did. The founders of the school
spent increasingly little time in the school as the project aged, and
the practitioners who did spend their days in the school were split
between, on the one hand, a group of game designers and curriculum
designers who were largely responsible for crafting the school's
innovative pedagogy and, on the other hand, teachers and administrators
who enacted the designers' pedagogic scripts, managed students and were
charged with keeping the school running. [It was the school's
philanthropic backers, its game and curriculum designers, and its
founders who remained the most enthusiastic about the school and its
innovative philanthropic potential, and yet they also **had
comparatively little responsibility for, as well as less exposure** to,
its quotidian functioning]{.underline}. Additionally, those of us who
were newer to educational reform were able to treat canonical practices
of discipline and control as respectfully belonging to the world of
professional educators. For example, one of the school's founders, a
media technology designer, noted to me that they also found educators'
classroom-management practices curious, but then quickly distanced
themselves from the remarkability of such practices by suggesting that
they were an oddity of what professional educators do.

Finally, and as noted earlier, [the school's isomorphic drift was
partially obscured and discounted because many of these **familiar
features had been recoded with terminology borrowed from technology
design**, especially game design. This terminology downplayed the ways
in which educators not only remade canonical practices, but also
controlled others through those practices. All these dynamics help
explain how reformers and educators were able to reconcile tensions and
contradictions between the project's ideals and its acts]{.underline}.
All have the effect of occluding, normalizing, translating and generally
downplaying the ways in which the school's pedagogic activities were
shot through with the very techniques that reformers aimed to disrupt.
Yet, practices that occlude, distort and overlook do not adequately
account for how reformers and educators also manage to maintain and
repair their sense that a philanthropic intervention is both
cutting-edge and morally sanctified. [Oversights can help such fixations
persist, but they do not provide experiences that renew a collective
sense of moral optimism]{.underline}. The maintenance and revitalization
of such feelings depend on the collective accomplishment, and ritualized
valorization, of what I call sanctioned counter-practices.

**[Designing Beneficial Experiences]{.underline}**

As discussed previously, the Downtown School's most [distinctive
innovation was to try to redesign the pedagogic activities of schooling
as if they were an engaging and beneficent game]{.underline}. Like the
reformers' spatial fixations, [this pedagogic fixation partially arose
through processes that **problematized not only conventional schooling,
but also modernist state institutions** more generally]{.underline}.
Like many other social [reformers who have been **inspired by the
seemingly dynamic organizations and work cultures of Silicon Valley**,
the designers and backers of the Downtown School problematized reformers
of the past for creating organizations that were hierarchical, rigidly
scripted and, hence, controlling]{.underline}. These previous attempts
at social and organizational engineering were seen as inhibiting, rather
than enhancing, the capacities of the people who worked in bureaucratic
organizations, as well as the people those organizations claimed to
serve. By contrast, [games appeared to offer an inspiring alternative
model for how experts and managers could design and organize experiences
for others. Game design, and experience design more generally, appeared
to offer a way for experts and managers to craft activities that were
organized and goal-driven, but also flexible, improvizational, creative
and even fun]{.underline}. Most importantly, doing so would allow
experts to redesign activities that benefited people in ways that more
Tayloristic approaches to organizing activity did not. Games and
experience design, proponents argued, would help unleash people's
inherent creative capacities and would thus amplify innovation, learning
and personal satisfaction.

[Of particular interest to the reformers who designed the Downtown
School was the work of the sociolinguist James Paul Gee, who had written
an influential book on the educational potential of video
games]{.underline} (2003). [**Gee had also received large grants** from
one of the philanthropic foundations that was sponsoring the Downtown
School, and he **served as an advisor** on the project]{.underline}. By
turning pedagogic activities into a game, the [school's designers hoped
to overcome conventional schooling's emphasis on tightly scripted and
obedient behavior, as well as its related reliance on surveillance and
coercive disciplinary techniques, which, as we know from Foucault
(1977), are **not features unique to schools**]{.underline}. According
to Gee and the school's founders, [well-designed games would allow
students to actively and creatively explore a 'problem
space']{.underline} that became incrementally more difficult as the
players progressed and their skills developed. [Moreover, these games
would **provide students with a context** for their activity and, thus,
with **resources for constructing personal meanings and emotional
investments** in their school-based activities]{.underline}. By taking
on the identity of the game's characters, students would not only be
motivated to participate in schooling, but they would also produce
beneficial personal transformations, conceptualized as learning, as they
did so.

The vignette at the opening of this chapter begins to illustrate how the
Downtown School's designers tried to implement this hopeful vision of
pedagogic activity. Near the beginning of a trimester, the teacher in
each course would introduce a 'mission' for that course. These episodes,
which typically lasted for 20 to 30 minutes, were meant to introduce
students to the designed game world that would frame the students'
schoolwork in that course for the trimester. The designed game worlds
would consist of characters that did not belong to the school and who
needed the students' help. For example, the sock puppets described in
the vignette at the opening of this chapter needed the students' help so
that their houses would stop falling down. In another class, a set of
fictional characters needed the students' help decoding messages in
order to solve a mystery about a missing character. In still another
class, professional editors at the transnational media conglomerate
Pearson supposedly needed students' help designing educational comics
and so on. Guided by teachers, students would interact with these
non-school characters through Skype phone calls, video chats, recorded
videos, blogs, e-mails, physical letters and other telecommunications.
In practice, these episodes were a noticeable break from conventional
classroom activities and, as evinced in the opening vignette, many
students did appear to be alert and engaged when they occurred, much as
the reformers had hoped.

[But when considered in terms of the school's everyday routines, a very
different picture of the school's pedagogic practices begins to
emerge]{.underline}. Most noticeably, [these **unconventional and
less-scripted moments were rather fleeting and negligible** compared to
the abundance of conventional, highly scripted schooling
activities]{.underline}. After brief episodes in which students
communicated with characters from the designed game worlds, [daily life
would quickly return to familiar school routines in which managers, here
teachers, **issued subordinates a near constant succession of
fine-grained commands**]{.underline}. In the vignette just described,
the sock puppets assigned the students paper worksheets that could be
completed as homework if they did not finish them in class. In the
school's math class, which had been framed as a code-breaking academy,
one of the students' first challenges was to take a paper and pencil
test on fractions. In class after class, a common pattern emerged: after
an unconventional and improvizational exchange with characters from the
designed game worlds, educators returned to conventional schooling
practices with familiar power relations and adult-scripted activities,
but these schooling practices had been relabeled as if they were part of
the game.

[Consider, for example, how the school's designers attempted to
transform the familiar disciplinary practices of hierarchical
observation, normalizing judgments and examinations]{.underline}
(Foucault 1977). According to the school's designers, [their goal was to
help all students become masters in the school's various knowledge
domains]{.underline}. Much like a video game, [students would get
feedback rather than grades, and progress would be measured in terms of
moving through various stages and levels in the game]{.underline}.
Moreover, this feedback would supposedly come from within the designed
game worlds. Instead of teachers assessing students, characters in the
designed game worlds would supposedly evaluate students' work. [The
above-mentioned paper-and-pencil test for the code-breaking academy is
an example of this sort of symbolic transformation of a familiar
disciplinary technique. The teacher presented the test]{.underline} as
if it were an entrance exam to the code-breaking academy, but it was
also [a formative assessment for the school's educators]{.underline}.
Moreover, the feedback students received on their various assignments
[did not use letter grades or points out of 100, as is done in
conventional schools, but it was still organized on a linear scale with
five ranked categories---master, senior, apprentice, novice and
pre-novice]{.underline}---each of which also had the equivalent of
pluses and minuses---Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. **[The labels had
changed, but the underlying practices had not]{.underline}**. The
school's designers envisioned a similar transformation in how they
organized the curriculum. All students were required to take the same
five courses, and they had little say over what they were expected to
learn in each course. While the reformers referred to these courses as
domains and assigned imaginative new labels to each one, the content of
these courses was defined mostly by state standards and to a lesser
degree the school's designers and educators. One course covered New York
State's standards for sixth-grade science education, another class
focused on the state standards for math education, another combined
social studies and English and language arts, and another course blended
physical fitness with what educators referred to as 'socioemotional
learning'. The school's most unconventional course focused entirely on
media production, which in the school's first year consisted of game
design. [The reformers also tried to incorporate what they referred to
as '21st-century literacies' within these domains, which in the school's
first year consisted of teamwork, systems thinking and time
management]{.underline}. Each domain was supposed to focus on these
literacies, as well as the state-mandated content. [In any case,
**students had no voice in shaping the curriculum**, despite reformers'
claims to be student-centred.]{.underline}

Overflowing and Retrofitting

[Not long after the school opened, it became evident that the school's
**game-like pedagogy did not have the motivational powers** that the
school's designers had hoped]{.underline}. Almost immediately after the
school opened, many [school leaders, teachers and parents worried that
students were out of control. Some **students talked back, made fun of
the** designed **game** characters, ignored or played with directives
from teachers and generally asserted themselves in ways that made it
difficult for teachers to stick to the scripted activities that they,
game designers and curriculum designers had jointly crafted. Students
were exercising their creativity and agency, but **not in the ways in
which the school's designers had anticipated or desired**]{.underline}.
Instead, students were transforming the reformers' carefully designed
activities towards their own interests and sensibilities. Here, for
example, is a snippet from my field notes not long after the school
opened:

We're lined up in the hallway waiting for Sarah \[the teacher\] to take
us to the gym. Before heading up the stairs Sarah reminds us of the
procedures we're supposed to follow after we arrive: place our bags and
jackets against the wall, run three laps around the perimeter of the
gym, then get in a big circle and quietly wait for her instructions.

Sarah goes on to tell us about the main activity for the day. She tells
us we're going to split into two lines and play a game with basketballs.
Troy shouts out, 'Knockout!' Several other students follow his lead and
also shout out 'Knockout.' Sarah ignores them and starts explaining what
we're going to do: a student at the front of one line will shoot the
basketball, then the person from the front of the other line will
rebound the ball and give it to the next person in the shooting line.
Each student will then go to the end of the opposite line and the
process will repeat.

'That's not Knockout,' Troy says.

Sarah says that this is what we'll be 'playing' today. Troy counters
that Knockout is more fun.

Sarah responds by telling Troy, 'When you grow up and become a teacher
then you can have everyone play Knockout.' Sarah also reminds the
students that gym was part of their grade.

Rake blurts out, 'Who knew so much fun stuff would be part of our
grade?'

Sarah tells him to, 'Knock off the attitude.'

[A similar dynamic played out in every class: when students tried to
question or bend reformers' and educators' scripted activities,
educators corrected them and tried **to compel their participation in
the school's version of fun**. Many educators equated student resistance
with personal disrespect or with spoiling the fun of the
group]{.underline}. For example, when one of the students called out,
'This is so fake!' as the teacher showed students a blog message that
had supposedly been written by a master game designer, [the teacher
snapped back, 'Stop ruining it for everyone!']{.underline} Similar
tensions played out in all classes, especially at the beginning of the
year.

[Reformers' and educators' **concerns about control also extended
beyond** the pedagogic activities of classrooms]{.underline}. As just
mentioned, the school's designers had allocated 45 minutes for lunch and
recess, which they roughly split into two equal time blocks. At the
beginning of the year [students could more or less do what they liked
during recess so long as they hung out in a designated classroom or the
gym]{.underline}, both of which were [monitored by adults]{.underline}.
[The students who hung out in the gym **produced a heterogeneous
assortment of activities** that often bled into one another. Students
**moved around noisily** and fluidly, many **improvizational games
emerged**, and participants moved in and out of various
activities]{.underline}, changing their own course and the course of the
activities in the process. Some students shot basketballs, some played
with jump ropes, others did cartwheels, some roamed the perimeter of the
gym and others hung out with friends in small groups. Many students
moved between activities and social groups and [there was no clear
overarching plan or structure, perhaps **suggesting opportunities for
breaking down preconceptions about class, gender and
race**]{.underline}.

However, some of the [school's designers and educators worried that this
arrangement was too chaotic, noisy and out of control]{.underline}. As
one of the school's designers mentioned to me as we watched the students
play during recess, '\[I don't know if they \[the students\] can handle
this. I could hear them from the street when I went to get lunch[.'
These moments of concern evince the dilemmas that contemporary
institutional reformers face as they **try to reconcile**, on the one
hand, their aspiration to design activities that promote **creativity**,
agency and transformations towards self-realization among an
intervention's intended beneficiaries and, on the other hand, the more
instrumental **mandate to control**, measure and develop those persons
**into particular idealized subjects**]{.underline}.

While these dilemmas could theoretically be moments in which reformers
questioned their assumptions, and particularly the enduring yearning to
create apolitical and philanthropic mechanisms for learning, [the
dominant tendency was to engage in a different sort of
fixation]{.underline}: the school's designers and educators quickly
[searched for resources that would stabilize the project against the
unanticipated turbulence]{.underline} of students' unsanctioned
behaviour. In response to students' resistance to the adult-scripted
activities---all of which [**evinced the student-centred agency** that
reformers championed]{.underline}---the school's designers, leadership
and educators quickly attempted to establish the authority of school
adults in order to regain control of students and hence their project.
Ironically, [they mostly did so by retrofitting the project with the
very techniques of discipline and control that were common at the
conventional schools against which they had defined their project and
themselves]{.underline}.

In several classrooms, [desks were rearranged from inward-facing
clusters of five desks]{.underline}---an arrangement [which put some
students' backs towards the teacher, but also allowed for easier peer
communications]{.underline} [during student-driven project work---**into
sequential rows that all faced the teacher** at the front of the
room]{.underline}. Further, educators intensified their efforts to
orchestrate a seamless flow of adult-scripted activities, even during
moments when students had previously enjoyed some autonomy, such as
recess and the brief passing period between classes. Within a week after
one of the school's designers expressed concern that students might not
be able to handle recess in the gym, educators introduced adult-scripted
activities for recess in the gym. [Half the gym was organized into a
football game administered by one of the educators. In the other half of
the gym, students were allowed to organize their own smaller games, so
long as they remained relatively quiet and spatially contained. Most
students who did not play football **stopped going to the gym after
these changes**, and some social divisions among students, notably
gender **divisions, became more spatially calcified** during
recess]{.underline}. During passing periods, which educators saw as
moments when they could lose control, teachers introduced a script in
which they organized students into quiet, forward-facing, single-file
lines before they left a classroom. After such a line was formed---which
could take some time---teachers marched students down the hallway to
their next class, where they then waited quietly against a wall until
the next teacher allowed them to enter. All teachers introduced this
script at the same time, about a month into the school year. Further, in
the middle of the fall, all the educators established a pedagogic script
where they directed students to begin a silent, individual,
teacher-defined task for five minutes immediately upon entering a new
classroom.

[In addition to extending practices of surveillance and control to
spaces and periods where students had previously experienced some
autonomy, educators also intensified their grip in domains where they
had already been exerting their authority]{.underline}, albeit in the
obscured ways discussed in the past section. In classrooms, educators
not only continued to define and enforce scripted activities for
students, but [in a Tayloristic fashion instructors started breaking
down these scripts **into ever-smaller step-by-step
procedures**]{.underline}. In many classes, [educators accompanied these
fine-grained scripts with techniques intended to facilitate a heightened
awareness of 'clock time']{.underline} (Thompson 1967) among students.
While modernist institutions have long emphasized clock time, [this
orchestration became more fine-grained and explicit than I expected. The
reformers referred to their focus on clock time as 21st-century literacy
called time management, but **time management typically had a lot to do
with classroom management**, in which students ironically had little say
over how they managed their time]{.underline}. Many educators saw clocks
and timers as a useful way to keep students on task during scripted
activities, as well as when they transitioned between these activities[.
What educators facilitated was a near-constant **awareness among
students of how much clock time they had left** or had spent on a given
task]{.underline}. When directing students to do a scripted activity,
educators would almost always tell the students how much time they had
for the activity. Many would use their laptops to project a digital
countdown timer for the activity onto the whiteboard at the front of the
class, which functioned as a continuous animation of clock time slipping
away. Many educators also wore stopwatches around their necks and
routinely referred to their stopwatches as they called out how much time
was left before the scripted activity ended. Educators expected students
to be in their assigned seats and listening for the next directive when
a timer ended.

Not only were these references to clock time much more pervasive and
evident than I had anticipated, but they somewhat surprisingly [had the
'gamifying' effect of adding a sense of urgency and competition to what
were otherwise rather trivial and boring tasks]{.underline}. The
approaching termination of the timer could [turn an otherwise boring and
scripted activity into a race against the clock]{.underline}, and as
timers approached zero you could [sense a palpable rise in the energy of
the students]{.underline}, an emotional rush that I also felt when I
participated in these rote routines. Several teachers even punctuated
the end of a countdown timer with the visualization and sound of a large
explosion, further adding to a sense of excitement, even though the
tasks that we were completing were often quite rote and meaningless.
This [rush against the clock was sometimes **reinforced by a
manufactured sense of competition**]{.underline} among students and
classes. For example, at one point during the year, [an educator made a
game out of how quickly students could line up]{.underline} quietly
before entering his classroom. He taped a large piece of butcher paper
on the wall outside his classroom and wrote how many seconds it took for
each class to line up quietly before being admitted into the room. This
went on for several weeks as [classes competed against each other to see
which class could be the most disciplined]{.underline}, until the
winning class had achieved a time of less than four seconds.

Of course, [these processes for creating order and discipline were **in
glaring contradiction to the reformers' pedagogic
fixations**]{.underline}---which purported [to cultivate student agency,
creativity, improvizational problem-solving capacities and so
forth---and yet, seemingly paradoxically, the designers of the school
were often complicit in the introduction of these highly scripted
practices]{.underline}. What is more, [many of these techniques were
either replicates, if not **enhancements, of the techniques used in the
more traditional schools** against which the reformers had
contradistinguished themselves]{.underline}. In keeping with [DiMaggio
and Powell's]{.underline} (1983) [notion of 'mimetic
isomorphism']{.underline}, many of these [canonical management
techniques were introduced either by reformers and educators who had
worked at other schools or by representatives from the]{.underline}
Downtown [School's]{.underline} School Support Organization
([SSO]{.underline}), [the latter of which was meant to replace school
boards within New York City's autonomy for accountability
exchange]{.underline}. And the techniques were introduced in a
coordinated and standardized fashion across the entire school, often
right after the school's weekly professional development session. Here,
for example, is a portion of an e-mail that one of the school's leaders
sent to the school's faculty and staff; in it, the leader explicitly
calls on educators to tighten their scripting of students' behaviour:

During \[our professional development period\] [we discussed the
importance of the directions we give students. Are directions given both
orally and in writing or are they only being delivered orally? Are they
broken down into small steps or are there many steps embedded in
narrative?]{.underline} Every lesson at The Downtown School thoughtfully
considers what students are being asked to do. Please remember to review
how you are asking them to do it.

This purposeful import and deployment of canonical disciplinary
practices [raises the curious question of how reformers managed to
reconcile their practices with their ideals]{.underline}. In the words
of Bennett Berger (2004), who studied similarly wide gaps between ideals
and acts in his study of a group of countercultural communards in
northern California, [such reconciliation requires a lot of ideological
work]{.underline}.

4 In, Against, and Beyond the Digital

[There is a **material history** of the **relationship between
technology, institutions, cultures, and practices**]{.underline}. In
analysing this material history, [the idea of the postdigital has been
framed in terms of:]{.underline} i[nteraction, complexity,]{.underline}
and [social change]{.underline}; **[digital subservience]{.underline}**
to the idea of the social; [digital transparency]{.underline} enabling
issues-based dialogue; the [stagnation of positivist, digital
discourses]{.underline}; the [digital reproduction of relationships of
power]{.underline}; the [decoding of relationships of power]{.underline}
through digital transparency; and a focus upon the platform rather than
the tool (Cormier et al. 2019; Jandrić et al. 2018).

At issue has been [how to **reimagine** the idea of the human inside
systems predicated upon]{.underline}:
c[o**mplexity-for-innovation**;]{.underline} a social terrain defned
around productive value; [obfuscation of the ways in which algorithmic
control is coded;]{.underline} the control of certain forms of public
data and their presentation; [ongoing techno-determinist readings of
progress]{.underline}; and the [subservience of life under
platforms]{.underline} that mediate and quantify existences. This
**[reimagining matters]{.underline}** [because, systemically and
productively, the only space for **radical imagination** appears to be
in the further, **ongoing digital colonisation** of the body and the
self, as a means of reproducing value]{.underline} (Berardi 2009;
Lazzarato 2014). This [process is limited precisely because the
spacetime of life is bounded by competition between digitally enabled
humans.]{.underline}

In this bounded space-time, [individuals, groups, or States attempt to
break or harness specifc technologies for particular political
ends]{.underline} (Watters 2021). Such contestation is [amplifed at the
boundary between the human and the development of convergence
technologies]{.underline}, based on the integration of 5G cellular
networks, tokenomics and forms of blockchain, machine augmentation,
sentiment analysis, biotechnologies, and so on. Interactions at these
boundaries then enforce human--machine intersections with digital,
monopoly capitalism in the form of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook,
and Apple, and the rise of alternate geopolitical rivals, in particular
from China. [As a result, the postdigital realities of HE, and teaching,
learning, and researching inside its institutions, are **framed** by the
**techno-colonisation** of what it means to be human from a variety of
intersecting structures and processes]{.underline} (Peters 2020).

Thus, [the idea of the postdigital needs to be discussed in relation to
its potential to act as a **dystopian pivot** for the convergence of the
personal/the person and a range of technologies]{.underline} (cognitive,
biological, nano-). The [terrain of aspiration is shaped through the
**exploitation of the fesh and of the mind**, the **augmentation enabled
by technology,** and the ongoing expropriation of what it means to be
human]{.underline}. [These moments of exploitation, expropriation, and
extraction are **rooted in wider, intersectional injustices**, grounded
in the separation of politics and economics, **denying the potential**
for a reintegrated **political economy** that **radically reimagines
society**]{.underline} (Hall 2018). As a result, [**social
reproduction** cannot be viewed beyond the lens of capital, and
technology cannot be viewed beyond the ways in which it expands the feld
of accumulation.]{.underline}

[Part of the issue is the apparent monopolisation of digitally enhanced
expertise, in relation to crises and their mitigation, by institutions
of higher learning.]{.underline} Either [private investment in
institutions or state-sponsored privatisation for the creation of
infrastructures like universities]{.underline} in which [private
investment]{.underline} can take hold [**disables populations** from
imagining futures that do not emerge from experts, technocrats, or
technologists]{.underline}. Moreover, beyond business-as-usual, the
postdigital institution has no political content. Thus, in the
separation of HE institutions from their publics, except through
exploitative labour and study conditions, contracts, licences, rents, or
modes of knowledge transfer, [there is a weakening of political
imagination]{.underline}. [Disciplinary separations, competition between
subjects and institutions, technologies for monitoring and audit, each
**reinforce** a value-driven, human-digital reality.]{.underline}

At issue is whether it is possible to work against this reality and the
multiple differential and unjust ways in which it is experienced.
**[This requires a new political economy]{.underline}**, [which seeks to
reduce the space and time required for the production of self-suffciency
and widen the base for autonomous existence]{.underline}. Might the very
[automation, or human--machine augmentation and symbiosis, demanded and
developed by capital to discipline and control labour make possible an
**exodus from the society of capitalist work**]{.underline}? As surplus
time arises as an outcome of automation, new, radical possibilities for
disposing of that time beyond the universe of value might be discussed.
This [requires a **re-connection** with the ideas of being human,
knowing the plurality of humanity, and acting or doing in humane
ways.]{.underline} This [includes a **reimagination of the relationship
between humans and the digital in the name of dignity**]{.underline}, in
order to **[recover autonomy]{.underline}** [for the self beyond being a
factory for value.]{.underline} [That factory and the inhumanity that it
breeds must be decomposed as a **starting point.**]{.underline}

### Framework---Optimization DA

#### Optimization DA: Framework functions as an attempt to [optimize]{.underline} our processing power in the digital age, which [quantifies]{.underline} the self.

Media, Society and Communication. "Five Theses on (Dis)Comfort in the
Educational Cultures of Digitality." 2021.

[Thesis 2: Operative fictions of optimizing processes of learning and
education correspond with poorly reflected assumptions of
mathematization and of the computability of the world]{.underline}

[Notions of optimizing processes and methods to quantify the self and
others are not inventions of the digital age]{.underline}. From choosing
[a lubricant for the first rotating fixed wheels]{.underline} to
choosing [efficient neural networks in machine-learning
programs]{.underline}, narratives and leitmotifs of [optimization have
been diversified and developed]{.underline}. An end to these traditions
is not in sight, on the contrary: [Computer network technologies have
made available processing capacities]{.underline} without which
developments in structural sciences and their manifold technological
applications would not have been possible.

[The frictions between encultured medial constellations]{.underline} of
the twentieth century [and the emerging new socio-technical
configurations]{.underline} of the twenty-first century [also affect the
key topics of education, especially growing up, learning and
teaching]{.underline}. The "[optimizing spirit]{.underline}" (Leineweber
& Wunder, 2021) that [pervades the rhetoric of digitalization makes some
people hope for a chance to **overcome the "technological
deficiency**]{.underline}" (Luhmann & Schorr, 1982) [and others
worry]{.underline} in view of certain fuzzy ideas of [**applying
rational measurement** models to the data-driven management of
**learning and development processes**]{.underline}. No matter if a
narrow or broad concept of technology is taken as a starting point, or
if referring to a technological deficiency is generally deemed to be
out-of-place or misleading with respect to the postulates of human
dignity and the development of autonomy: The increasingly refined and
partly automated measuring methods open up widened scopes of
calculating, monitoring, manipulating and controlling, up to
re-educating entire population groups.

[These enhanced and sometimes de-limited scopes]{.underline} at the
interfaces of quantitative-empirical education research, education
policy and education economy may [prove of value in some regards as
"operative fictions"]{.underline} (Schmidt, 2006, p. 4). On the other
hand, in the course of becoming reality, the [fantasies of optimization
occasionally mutate into **paradoxes of optimization**]{.underline}
(Wolf & Thiersch, 2021) -- [not least when the polymorphism of
pedagogical "logics" is consistently interpreted and assessed in the
light of machine-, market- or media logics]{.underline} and the
self-similarity of the process dynamics does not come into view anymore.
[The tendencies towards rationalism of disposition are **not linked to a
particular rationality** or version of rationalism]{.underline}. They
concern all forms of rationalism, which characteristically [tend to
absolutize the determination of starting positions, assessment
modalities, means, purpose, or procedures and authorities for **the
deliberate production of behaviors or specific
circumstances**]{.underline} (cf. Hug et al., 2007). To what an extent
the algorithmic rationality opens up new scopes in this context cannot
be answered at this point. The discussion of "generative realities"
(Löffler, 2019) as calculated, predictable and controlled realities has
only just begun.

[Such tendencies can be found in the **algorithm-based timing of
learning technology** and the AI-based production of specific
qualification effects]{.underline}. They do not only run counter to the
obstinacy of open-ended educational processes. [They]{.underline} also
[contradict **education-related uncertainty principles**]{.underline}.
Furthermore, they cor[respond with ideas that processes of learning and
communication are predictable on the basis of calculations]{.underline}
and formally [schematized competency elements, without consistently
considering the human capacities to **differentiate between sense and
nonsense**]{.underline}, to spontaneously depart from rules in the
action process, and to creatively connect Phantasie und Kalkül
(Schneider, 1992). And what is more, a discomfort with the optimization
discourses stems from [these discourses' lack of reflection when it
comes to the limits of mathematical languages]{.underline} (Frey, 1967),
[algorithmic rationality]{.underline} (Mersch, 2019), [and the
computability of the world]{.underline} (Pietsch et al., 2017).

### AT: Academy Fails

#### The academy can be reimagined towards a reengagement of human relation with cybernetic realities.

**Hall 21** -- Professor of Education and Technology, Research Associate
in the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility at De Montfort
University. "Venturing Beyond the Imposition of a Postdigital,
Anti-human Higher Education." Springer link. Apr 2021.
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-65592-1_4, AG

[Composting the Anti-human University]{.underline}

Marx (1867/1976: 547) argued that [machinery is 'a more hideous form
\[for\] exploiting labour-power']{.underline}, reducing the worker into
'a part of the specialised machine', and both reducing wages and
breeding 'helpless dependence upon the factory as a whole'. [The
concrete realities of the HE terrain described as postdigital are of
struggle against the discipline of **commodity production and
exchange**]{.underline} and for humane cultures and practices. Some of
these struggles are noted above, as students, teachers, and their
communities push the boundaries of education for another world.
[However, being against a system places bodies and identities at-risk of
being disciplined.]{.underline}

Curle (1973: 8--9) emphasised the [need for a **new
education**]{.underline}, [which demands]{.underline} 'an alien form of
society' [that values the human, or our **shared
humanity**]{.underline}. [This is the possibility of personal evolution,
or 'higher-awareness (awareness-identity)', formed inside a
**counter-system of education** rooted in altruism]{.underline} (or
#solidarity). This [counter-system]{.underline} has echoes of Gramsci's
work on hegemony and counter-hegemony, [rooted in acknowledging,
analysing, and abolishing power, in both formal and informal
settings]{.underline}. For Curle (1973: 10), such a counter-system would
have higher levels of (social) awareness (beyond value[). It would be
grounded in awarenessidentity]{.underline} (social connections
against-and-beyond the market), [and as such be altruistic and
**empathetic with peaceful relations** that are based on cooperative and
egalitarian democracy.]{.underline}

In addressing how education relates to the creation of such a
counter-system, Curle (1973: 17) diagnosed that [we need to **reveal the
reality of the system** as is, in order to demonstrate how **hegemony**
rests on **making particular lives** **intolerable or
invisible**]{.underline}. As a result, it becomes possible to prefgure
other ways of knowing how to live, as a process that is generative,
iterative, and educative (Amsler 2015). [In revealing how life inside
the **postdigital University** or college is reproduced forvalue, and
the lived experiences of those made marginal inside this system, it
becomes possible to **discuss the values** upon which living might be
organised.]{.underline}

This [**reimagines the University** as a **pedagogical project** that
begins from humans and their society as it is embedded and reproduced in
nature.]{.underline} It is a '[sacred' project, grounded in 'the
practice of freedom']{.underline} (hooks 1994: 13). [Such practice is
learning and teaching **not as algorithmically or cybernetically
managed** and fnessed, rather as a **process**, **integrated with the
souls** of students and teachers, and in **symbiosis** with 'the
necessary conditions where learning can most deeply and intimately
begin'.]{.underline}

This idea of symbiosis and necessary conditions is critical in thinking
about [venturing beyond the universe of value, which reproduces itself
through dialectical pro cesses that are technologically
enriched.]{.underline} As has been noted, Marx (1867/1976: 473)
described the dialectical relationship between technologies and forms of
production, relations to nature, particular social relations, mental
conceptions of the world, labour processes, arrangements for governance
and regulation, and the conduct of daily life. At issue is whether and
[how to take these relationships as they form the necessary conditions
for **capitalist reproduction**, and to **move beyond their hegemonic
description of the world.**]{.underline}

Here, French et al. (2020) describe [composting as a **metaphor for
re-engaging humans** with the conditions inside which they reproduce
their world.]{.underline} A starting point is a [**thick dialogue**
**grounded in lived experiences** of exploitation, expropriation, and
extraction, in this case emerging from 'stories of displacement,
dispossession, dislocation, disclosure/enclosure, discomfort/comfort,
and binaries']{.underline}. In [**engaging** with the **realities** of
settler colonialism, these authors identify hegemonic structures,
pathologies, and methodologies as 'invasive, ongoing, and invisible',
and which **scrub existing human relations of any
meaning.**]{.underline} They argue the need to compost anger, grief, and
trauma, as a process of unearthing and breaking down distortions, and
thereby creating 'a garden of truth-telling' (French et al. 2020).
Composting serves 'as a rich metaphor for our experiential approach to
documenting our stories and building relationships with one another,
with our ancestors and with land, because it is itself a relational
process that repeats and is enriched with every churning of the soil'.

The process of composting centres humanity and feelings, stories,
histories, relationships, cultures, and lands. Through a [**deep
engagement** **with truth-telling**, it seeks to begin from suffering
and apparent hopelessness, in order to **cultivate alternative ways of
being, knowing, and acting in the world.**]{.underline} Engaging with
this struggle [in educational contexts requires]{.underline} [refection
on the realities]{.underline} of the time required for truth-telling,
alongside individual fallibilities and personal limitations, and
potential for paralysis when faced by overwhelming, structural crises
and forms of power (Tuck and McKenzie 2015).

Yet, in the desire to curate and cultivate ways of living more humanely,
those who labour in postdigital HE might usefully seek to grapple with
Tuck's (2018) question: '**[how shall we live]{.underline}**?'. [In a
technologically enriched, interconnected set of environments, inside
which individual behaviours and actions are increasingly
**cybernetically tracked and controlled**, and inside which legitimacy
is judged in relation to systemic norms, this **question is both
imperative and revolutionary**]{.underline}. This is more so because the
idea of composting the world as it is speaks to a system that needs to
decompose and lives that need to be fertilised in new ways, lest they
wither or remain unfulflled. Against the morbid realities of HE, and of
living and studying in the shadow of value, [this is a **starting point
for reimagining the relationship** between humans and their
technologies, and how they are integrated in institutions, cultures and
practices.]{.underline}

### AT: Liberalism Good---Fascism

#### We straight turn this. They [empower]{.underline} fascism by tricking liberalism into believing it can sustain itself.

[One might be forgiven for thinking that **America is
dead**.]{.underline}

[The country does not have a president. Biden]{.underline}, if he ever
existed, [has been annihilated by the disaster of the
retreat]{.underline}. [This country does not have one people but two,
and they are at war with each other]{.underline}. The [allies are
melting away]{.underline} and, last but not least, [China is winning the
diplomatic battle and also the economic competition]{.underline}.

All this is true, but [you should not forget a non irrelevant detail:
**America is also a techno-military complex**]{.underline} [(Google and
the Pentagon and so on) in possession of a destructive power capable of
razing the planet and **eliminating mankind** not once but **many times
over**]{.underline}, and it is [acquiring the ability to evacuate a
small minority of humans from planet Earth]{.underline} towards no one
knows where.

The [Afghan defeat marks the turning point in]{.underline} a process of
[disintegration of the West]{.underline} whose signals have accumulated
over the past two decades.

Here I use the word West to mean a geopolitical entity that corresponds
to the Judeo-Christian cultural world (and therefore includes Russia
itself).

[Perhaps capitalism is eternal]{.underline}, a hypothesis to be verified
[if we have the time, but]{.underline} I don\'t think we will. [The West
does not]{.underline}. And unfortunately, [the techno-military complex
that the West has at its disposal, and which continues to feed despite
its ability to overkill, does not respond to the logic of politics, but
is an **automatism that responds to a logic of
deterrence**]{.underline}. Once upon a time [deterrence was bipolar and
symmetrical, but after the collapse of the USSR it has a multipolar,
asymmetrical and therefore interminable dynamic]{.underline}.
Furthermore, the techno-military complex is also an economic power that
must produce war in order to reproduce itself.

This is why [we should not be too pleased with the collapse of the West:
the crumbling of the West will not be an (almost) peaceful
process]{.underline}, as was the collapse of the Soviet Empire between
1989 and \'91.

Before collapsing, [the West could erase the world not because of
political reasons]{.underline}, (the political brain is evidently
affected by necrosis), but [because of a chain of technical, military
and psychological **automatic reactions**.]{.underline}

[Think of Italy: despite being a second-tier military
power]{.underline}, the country where I live [has only 15 anti-fire
aircrafts, while it has 716 fighter aircrafts]{.underline}. What do we
do with this [disproportionate arsenal]{.underline}? [Why is Italy
investing a huge amount in a fighter plane called Tempest]{.underline},
along with Germany and England, while [the effects of Covid are
destroying the welfare]{.underline} of many?

Can you tell me why?

Now, [after yet another defeat that the West (NATO, the US, Europe) has
suffered in a conventional war, **it is naive** to think that the West
is giving up on war. The West, therefore, will soon be **led into
unconventional warfare**.]{.underline}

[Capitalism is no longer able to allow the reproduction of mankind;
**expansion has reached its peak**.]{.underline} [Capitalist
valorization is now essentially achieved through the extraction of
physical and nervous **resources that are on the verge of
exhaustion**]{.underline}, [and through the destruction of the planetary
physical environment and the collective brain]{.underline}. At this
point, I see two diverging perspectives: the dissolution of capitalism
followed by the creation and spread of autonomous, egalitarian and
frugal communities.

Or war. More likely: both perspectives at the same time.

What is certain, however, is the [inability of the West to accept what
is now its manifest destiny: decline, dissolution,
disappearance]{.underline}.

Nazi-Liberal Suprematism

[The collapse of the West is linked to processes that we can now pick
out with the naked eye: the **first is the growing infertility** of the
peoples of the north of the world (in 50 years the fertility of males of
the Northern hemisphere has dropped by 52%).]{.underline} [Whether it is
due]{.underline}, as Sarah Swan argues in her recent book Count Down,
[to the **spread of microplastics** in the food chain, and to hormonal
disorders caused by these microplastics, or whether it is due to the
more or less conscious choice of women not to **give birth to
victims**]{.underline} [of rapidly spreading global fire]{.underline},
does not matter. The white dominators of the planet are senescent and
tend to disappear.

[The **second** process **is** the emergence of **anti-Western
capitalist powers** (China) which for reasons inscribed in the
psycho-cognitive formation have been more easily adaptable to the
dynamics of the digital swarm with which Western individualism
conflicts]{.underline}. (See in this regard Yuk Hui's book
Cosmotechnics, published by the MIT Press).

[The **third is the mental crisis**, the self-contempt]{.underline} and
the suicidal drive of the white population, unable to cope with the
great migration, a consequence of colonization and wars, [that is
**undermining the global order**]{.underline}.

(Perhaps it would be worth rereading and updating some of Mao Tse
Tung\'s and Lin Piao\'s considerations on the peripheries surrounding
and strangling the center).

[The European population, defending white privilege tooth and nail, is
**incapable of dealing with migration**]{.underline}. Europeans [refuse
to recognize the need for a restitution of stolen
resources]{.underline}, and f[ear a "great replacment" by non-white
people]{.underline}. This is why neo-reactionary movements of
nationalism and racism are on the rise in Europe.

According to Achille Mbembe,

[Ultranationalism and **racial supremacy ideologies are experiencing a
global renaissance**. The idea of ​​an essential human similarity has been
replaced by the notion of difference, taken as anathema and
prohibition]{.underline} \... Concepts such as the human, the human
race, the human race or [humanity mean almost nothing, even if
contemporary pandemics and the consequences of the ongoing combustion of
the planet continue to give them weight and significance]{.underline}.
In the West, but also in other parts of the world, we are witnessing the
[rise of new forms of racism that we could define as
paroxysmal]{.underline}. The nature of paroxysmal racism is that, in a
metabolic way, [it can infiltrate the functioning of power, technology,
culture, language and even the air we breathe]{.underline}. The double
turn of racism towards a techno-algorithmic and eco-atmospheric variety
is making it an increasingly lethal weapon, a virus. [This form of
racism is called viral because it goes hand in hand with the
exacerbation of fears, including and above all **the fear of
extinction**, which seems to have become **one of the driving forces
behind white supremacy** in the world.]{.underline}

[Mbembe speaks of late-Eurocentrism. I prefer the expression
'nazi-liberal suprematism,' because colonial privilege is the junction
point between social darwinism and the politics of extermination:
natural selection.]{.underline}

### AT: Liberalism Good---Peace

#### Liberal peace is inseparable from the [violent façade of liberal pacification]{.underline} which obscures the [escalating cycle]{.underline} of phenomenological violence at the [heart]{.underline} of the world order that kills [value to life]{.underline} and ensures [nuclear war]{.underline}

[Phenomenology]{.underline}, as we are using it, [is **not about lived
experience**]{.underline}. [It is the]{.underline} philosophical
[tradition of **revealing different types of beings** and **things**
that contain meaning in our world, the **structures** and/or
**contexts** in which they exist, and how these structures and contexts
are **meaningful**]{.underline}. Understood in this way, [**violence**
is one of these structures and/or contexts]{.underline}. A
phenomenological perspective does not approach violence from a
particular normative position, although it does not preclude normative
critique. [A phenomenological approach **does not treat violence as a
discrete thing** that one agent does to another]{.underline}, although
it does not preclude such acts being described as violent. Instead, [a
phenomenological perspective **adds to our intellectual** and
**methodological toolbox** by identifying violence as a **condition** or
**context** in which people function. Phenomenology allows us to
identify violence occurring in ways and in places that we **otherwise
would not be able to recognize**]{.underline}. It does not change the
meaning of violence (as harm, for example). Instead, [it treats violence
**ontologically**, enabling us to **reveal more accurately** the extent
to which violence exists in the world]{.underline}.

[From a phenomenological perspective, violence is **often
inconspicuous**. Violence can function as a **naturalized** or
**internalized regime of compulsion** or **domination**.
**Pacification** reveals both the **pervasiveness of violence** and
**forms of violence that may otherwise remain inconspicuous**. The
**erasing of tradition** and the **enforcement of particular legal
codes** at the expense of **indigenous cultural norms** is one example
of an **inconspicuous form** of violence]{.underline} that involves
conspicuous and inconspicous consequences (Cocks 2014). [In
understanding violence **phenomenologically**]{.underline}, as a
structure of revealing across multiple worlds, [we are **better able to
reveal the extent** to which violence **shapes our world** and how we
are then **shaped by violence**]{.underline}.

Pacavere

The Romans understood violence as a necessary condition for pax. [The
liberal imagination]{.underline} blinds itself to [\[**obfuscates**\]
the ways that pacification **functions as violence** in our world order.
**I**]{.underline}nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations
scholarship['s]{.underline} [**strict distinction** between peace and
violence **reinforces this obfuscation**. Yet, the **violence of** (and
**in**) **pacification is central to the contemporary
world**.]{.underline} A phenomenological approach shows that [moments of
violent rupture are **not aberrations** of the world order. Violent
outbreaks are **breakdowns of pacification**]{.underline}. It follows
that [multiple structures of the world order function as the violence of
pacification]{.underline}, of pacavere.12 [These structures include
**liberal capitalism**, **colonialism** and the **postcolonial
aftermath**, and **war**]{.underline}. Each functions as a key site of
pacification. Anarchist thought reveals the pacification in liberal
capitalism. Postcolonial thought reveals the pacification of colonial
projects. Both anarchist and postcolonial thought demonstrate how war is
a breakdown of pacification, revealing the hidden violent structures of
our worldhood.

Anarchist critiques of capitalism, unlike Marxist and liberal
interpretations, take seriously the decisive role of state violence in
structuring society and markets. Anarchists view [the
**state**]{.underline} as an institution that [**sustains elite
appropriations** of political and economic power]{.underline} (Proudhon
\[1861\] 1998; Sorel 1999; Prichard 2015). [Those at the bottom of the
social hierarchy **bear the costs** of this enforced order. The state
**diffuses violence** (pacification) throughout the entire
society---often in ways that **go unrecognized** by its
subjects]{.underline} (Sorel 1999, 65). [The naturalization of violence
**consolidates arbitrary regimes of domination** in society. While
**specific**, **countable incidents** of violence **may decline**, the
social order is **largely premised** on the **threat of violence** for
contravening social norms making specific, countable incidents of
violence **relatively rare**]{.underline} (Kinna and Prichard,
forthcoming).

[Anarchist thinkers view **rising inequality** in the context of
**declining riots**, **insurgencies**, and
**assassinations**]{.underline} (see Figure 1) [as **evidence of
pacification**. Incidents of proletarian violence, anticolonial
violence, riots, and protests are all examples of resistance to the
"regimes of domination" that shape contemporary society]{.underline},
regimes easily identifiable by those subject to them (Gordon 2007, 33).
Drawing on these accounts, [we interpret declining rates of riots as a
sign of **increased pacification**, **rather than evidence** that the
system is **becoming less violent**]{.underline}. Conversely, eruptions
of antistate and anticapitalist direct violence are signs of a breakdown
in pacification. Much like Heidegger's example of broken equipment
(1962, 102--3, 412--13), which draws our attention to the background
structures of our world, brief instances of direct violence reveal
violently structured social relations.

[Although the liberal imagination **obscures the centrality of
violence**, violence **has always been central** to the liberal world
order]{.underline}---to the liberal worldhood---[particularly during the
**colonial** and **imperial projects**]{.underline} of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries (Bell 2007a, 2007b). [Colonial violence was
**diffused throughout the entire society**, often in ways that **went
unrecognized** by the colonized themselves. The violence of pacification
**structured the very existence** of the colonized subject]{.underline}.
This violence transformed the colonized subjects into a different
"species" (Fanon 1963, 35-- 40, 43). [Colonial pacification was **more
than direct** and **indirect violence**; it was sufficiently diffuse to
**remake the psyche** of the colonized, **affecting their mental
health** and **emotions**]{.underline} (Fanon 1963, 35--106).
[Fanon]{.underline} (1963, 31) [described it as "**atmospheric
violence**," a "violence **rippling under the skin**." Unable to lash
out against the colonizer, the colonized lived everyday within a world
ordered by violence]{.underline}. In this world, the colonized could not
respond to the colonizers for fear of directly violent reprisals and
would turn to symbolic activities such as a dance circle to expose the
violence experienced on a daily basis (Fanon 1963, 57). For the
colonized, rituals such as the dance were a means of expressing
existential frustrations with and resistance to the violence of colonial
pacification through reenactments of direct violence. Ultimately,
anticolonial struggles exposed the violence of colonialism by directing
that violence back on its authors.

Practices of colonial rule were central to developing liberal norms of
sovereignty, as well as to the domination and control of recalcitrant
populations whether within Europe, such as the English domination of the
Welsh, Irish, and Scots, or outside of Europe by settler colonialists
against indigenous populations (Deloria Jr 1974; Anghie 2005; Miller
2006; Havercroft 2008; Shaw 2008; Barkawi and Stanski 2012; Coulthard
2014; Simpson 2014; Lightfoot 2016; Rueda-Saiz 2017). [This civilizing
imagination **functioned phenomenologically**. It produced insiders as
**civilized** and **peaceful** and outsiders as **violent**, **external
threats** to civilization. In doing so, this imagination **successfully
obscured**]{.underline} how the structures of liberalism produced
colonial violence.**[13]{.underline}**

**[FOOTNOTE 13]{.underline}** Arguments about [the **foundational role
of colonialism**, **primitive accumulation**, and **white supremacy** in
structuring the modern international system]{.underline} are
particularly useful in thinking about phenomenological violence (Jones
2006; Anievas, Manchanda, and Shilliam 2015; Du Bois 1915; Shaw 2008;
Coulthard 2014; Deloria 1974; Lowe 2015; Hartman 1997). [The legacy of
these practices **pervades contemporary liberal
peace-building**]{.underline} (Richmond 2014; Sabaratnam 2015; Bouka
2013; Autesserre 2009) [and **liberal global governance**]{.underline}
(Koomen 2014a, 2014b, 2013), [while trade liberalization can
**facilitate mass violence**]{.underline} (Kamola 2007; Smith 2016).
Césaire argues that [colonialism produced a "**boomerang effect**"
within European societies; **Nazism** was the return of violence
previously "**applied only to non-European peoples**"]{.underline}
(Césaire 2000, 36). At independence, [**international law became a
mechanism** for reinforcing this international order upon the previously
colonized world]{.underline} (Grovogui 1996).

[The idea of war as an **external practice** of states, **not tied** to
their **internal workings** and located according to **specific
normative projections** of Western identity, **followed** from this
colonial mentality. This mentality **legitimized the exporting of
violence** to create a **Western imperial pax** and was so widespread
that it **shaped the development of modern warfare**]{.underline} (Ellis
1986; Proudhon \[1861\] 1998). [The colonial wars **reproduced** and
**reinforced ideologies of Western superiority**, evidenced in part by
the West's **superior military technology**. A consequence of this
racist hubris was the **inability to foresee the destructive
tendencies** of Western warfare when **unleashed against
themselves**]{.underline} (Ellis 1986).

The discipline of international relations, founded in response to the
unexpectedly destructive character of the First World War, reproduced
this understanding of war.14 [This understanding **disguises the
possibility of increasing violence** within the liberal world by
**presuming a historical narrative of progress** and **being shocked by
its aberration**. War, however, is **not the absence of peace** or an
**aberration of liberal progress**, but is instead a **phenomenological
breaking** of the liberal worldhood.]{.underline}15

[Once a liberal order]{.underline} of democracy, free markets, [and
international institutions are **spread throughout the world**, liberal
ideology imagines peace as the end state. Yet, states **often deploy war
under liberal guises**]{.underline}.16 [Wars under the aegis of
humanitarian values and regime change are examples of the multifaceted
character of liberal pacification. Liberal regimes emphasize the
violence of those that they are invading, while minimizing the violence
involved in these military undertakings and the violence necessary to
sustain the liberal societies themselves]{.underline}. What
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon called ["the **moral phenomenology of
war**"]{.underline} (Prichard 2015, 112--34; Proudhon \[1861\] 1998)
[becomes an **integral part** of the **everyday workings of society**
that shape **innumerable aspects** of our daily language]{.underline}.
The upshot is that, [within liberal ideology, the violence committed by
liberal states is justified, whereas the violence committed by illiberal
states is not]{.underline}.

Postcolonial and anarchist scholarship focuses on the incorporation of
violence in the production of liberal spaces (Barkawi and Laffey 1999).
These same concerns can be directed onto the liberal order itself. [Seen
from the perspective of **marginalized** and **oppressed populations**,
the structures of liberal pacification take on a **distinctly violent
aspect**. The liberal world is **not less violent**. Rather, the liberal
world involves a **sophisticated phenomenological process** of
**legitimating certain types of violence** in order to **render other
types of violence invisible**]{.underline}.

Liberal Pacification

What does it mean to apply this third type of violence to our
understanding of international relations? Pacification reveals
liberalism as a violent process as opposed to a system that is
emblematic of the absence of direct violence. There are parallels
between the Pax Britannia, Pax Americana, and the ancient peace of the
Pax Romana (Neocleous 2010, 13). However, our account emphasizes the
crucial role of pacification as a distinct kind of violence in
maintaining these pacific orders. Our theory offers the novel insight
that incorporating pacification into the analysis of the liberal peace
reveals crucial aspects of this peace that conventional and critical
accounts neglect.

A focus on pacification provides three critical insights. First, it
recovers the crucial role of pacification in the historical founding of
the liberal order. Second, by distinguishing between three kinds of
violence (Figure 2), we account for the empirical observations of the
liberal peace as leading to a decline in direct violence and an increase
in violence overall as part of the pacification of the Pax Americana.
Conversely, the liberal version of the Pax Americana cannot account for
key anomalies. Third, our approach draws attention to the violent
ordering of social relations. This dimension of violence is neglected
even in Marxist, postcolonial, neo-Gramscian, and post-structuralist
critiques of the liberal peace, which primarily focus on the role of
direct and indirect violence in maintaining the Pax Americana.

Contemporary liberal international relations theory emphasizes the
nonviolent role of the liberal triad (democracy, free markets, and
institutions) in causing the liberal peace. Yet, a quick review of the
history of liberalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries shows
that key figures in liberalism, from John Stuart Mill, to Joseph
Galliéni, to American foreign policy elites, understood pacification as
a necessary step in establishing and maintaining the liberal order

Mill, one of the philosophical founders of liberalism, conceptualized
and deployed liberalism as a domination strategy. Mill argued that it is
appropriate to impose despotism or slavery on "savages" who incline to
"fighting and rapine," but the government should use force as little as
possible:

What they require is not a government of force, but one of guidance.
Being, however, in too low a state to yield to the guidance of any but
those to whom they look up as the possessors of force, the sort of
government fittest for them is one \[that\] possesses force, but seldom
uses it. (Mill 1998, 232--33)

In terms of our conceptual distinction, Mill argued that liberalism as
pacification was a more effective instrument of violence than the direct
modes of violence that governments usually deploy.

The history of European colonialism is replete with this line of
reasoning. "\[L\]iberal improvement" was a regular plank of colonial
strategy by France and Britain in the nineteenth century (Owens 2015,
154). Consider one example from the French colonial tradition. Galliéni,
a military commander and administrator, consciously deployed liberalism
as a domination strategy in the pacification of Tonkin during the 1890s.
Galliéni's strategy involved slowly spreading military outposts and
deploying civil administrators to create markets, schools, and
amenities. The rationale was that locals would gain a personal interest
in the continuation of French control and would help to quell Chinese
brigandage. "Piracy," said Galliéni, "is the result of an economic
condition. It can be fought by prosperity" (quoted in Owens 2015, 157).
Galliéni devised a "theory of pacification" in which "the correct
combination of force and politics can socialize, pacify, and domesticate
a population into regulating itself" (quoted in Owens 2015, 157). What
Mill proposed in theory, Galliéni enacted in practice;
pacification---the violent reordering of social relations in a
colony---was a more effective means of maintaining liberal rule than the
deployment of direct violence.

[While less explicit, the relationship between liberalism and
imperialism **remained present**]{.underline} in the twentieth-century
development of the Pax Americana. During this era, US policy makers
sought to construct a zone of peace distinct from the zones of war
associated with authoritarian regimes. The US State Department first
recognized the concept of "hegemonic pacification" in the Euro-Atlantic
conference diplomacy of the 1920s (Cohrs 2008, 619). [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' ["**strategic
restraint**"]{.underline} in the aftermath of World War Two [was
motivated by this concept of **liberal**, **hegemonic
pacification**]{.underline} (Ikenberry 2009; Ikenberry 2011, 173). US
defense officials Stimson, Patterson, McCloy, and Assistant Secretary
Howard C. Peterson agreed that it was a matter of the security interests
of the United States to maintain "open markets, unhindered access to raw
materials, and the rehabilitation of much---if not all---of Eurasia
along liberal capitalist lines" (Leffler 1984, 349--56; Barkawi and
Laffey 1999). Liberalism as a domination and pacifying strategy
continued throughout (and long after) the Cold War (Laffey 2003; Stokes
2003), as evident in one of the founding documents of the post--World
War Two liberal order, NSC-68 (Ikenberry 2011, 168). [While the
enforcement of a Pax Americana **eventually yielded a decline** in
direct violence, it **produced an increase** in other types of
violence]{.underline}. The first insight of our theory is that
[pacification **has always been part of the liberal project**
and]{.underline} that [the violence in the liberal project **never went
away**]{.underline}.

The second insight is that [by reinterpreting the liberal peace as
liberal pacification we are able to **grant the empirical findings** of
liberal peace theorists while **maintaining** that the Pax Americana
represents an **intensification of violence overall**]{.underline}.
[In]{.underline} the language of [**positivist social science**, our
theory is **observationally equivalent** to that of liberal peace
theory]{.underline}. We expect that [the quantity of direct violence
**inversely associates** with the degree of pacification in a
society]{.underline}. Therefore, [our interpretation **challenges
research** that identifies liberal institutions as the cause of
declining violence. Liberal institutions, as apparatuses of liberal
pacification, ensure that direct violence is increasingly rare while
**leaving the structures of violence** and **domination in
place**]{.underline}. The observational equivalence on particular
dependent variables (in our case, all forms of direct violence) produces
a theoretical change requiring the generation of novel observable
implications (King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 30).

Furthermore, [**increased suffering** in liberal societies **provides
evidence contradicting the main claims** of liberal peace theories,
while **remaining consistent** with liberal pacification]{.underline}.
At its core, [liberalism is a project that **tries to maximize the
utility** of its subjects]{.underline} (in other words, [**minimize
suffering** while **maximizing happiness**]{.underline}). As such, [a
state of liberal peace should lead to a decrease in markers of
suffering. However, there is **more slavery** in the world today than
ever before, with conservative estimates of **between 12.3** and **27
million people** in debt bondage, chattel, or contract
slavery]{.underline} (Gordon 2012).17 Moreover, [there is **ample
evidence** of rising psychological disorders in liberal societies. A
**preponderance of evidence** from the United States suggests that
**depression**, **anxiety**, **alienation**, **opioid dependency**,
**stress**, **other related psychological disorders**, **increased
social isolation**, and the **decline of community have
increased**]{.underline} throughout the twentieth century (Twenge,
Zhang, and Im 2004, 320; Adler, Boyce, Chesney, et al. 1994; Twenge
2000; Twenge, Konrath, Foster, et al. 2008; Twenge, Gentile, DeWall, et
al. 2010; Cohen and Janicki-Deverts 2012; American Society of Addiction
Medicine 2016). [Changes to human life associated with modernity have
**caused psychological stress to increase**]{.underline} (Jackson 2014).
[**Mortality rates** have increased]{.underline} for some white,
non-Hispanics aged 45--54 in the United States between 1999 and 2013
(Case and Deaton 2015). [**Modern technological advances** from
television to the Internet may contribute to **increasing separation**
and **alienation**]{.underline} of the social human animal [into
**individualized bodies** connected by **increasingly weak** and **empty
bonds**]{.underline} (Putnam 2000; Gray 2011; Turkle 2011). At minimum,
[new information communication technology such as Facebook can
**increase the stress** and **anxiety** of its users]{.underline}
(Lee-Won, Herzog, and Park 2015). [The **violent structuring** of
liberalism enables **increases in social alienation**, **anxiety**,
**stress**, and **human bondage** through repression, economic control,
and social isolation.]{.underline}

[These are **not isolated instances** of suffering. They are
**fundamental structural features** of our liberal world]{.underline}.
If liberalism is a process of pacification rather than simply peace,
then this rise in individual suffering in liberal spaces may be evidence
of a similar process that Fanon equated with the psychic life of the
colonist. Just as Fanon's colonial subjects, unable to lash out at the
settler through direct violence, internalized their suffering, [modern
liberal subjects, **unable to resist liberal pacification**,
**internalize their suffering**]{.underline} (1982, chap. 6; cf. Sorel
1999, 118). [Liberal peace should bring about a rise in happiness; that
it has instead led to rising suffering is evidence of liberal
pacification]{.underline}.

Third, in addition to offering an alternative interpretation of the
liberal peace, our theory of liberal pacification supplements key
insights from critical approaches to peace. Tarak Barkawi and Mark
Laffey's work on imperial processes and liberal spaces makes a similar
point to ours, that the celebrated zone of liberal peace rests on
practices of violence (Barkawi and Laffey 1999, 2002; cf. Neocleous et
al. 2013). Their account, however, focuses on practices of direct
violence, such as humanitarian interventions against authoritarian
regimes or corporations hiring local militias to make work sites in the
global south safe for economic extraction (Barkawi and Laffey 1999,
422). Our point is that these moments of direct violence lead to
pacification wherein social relations have been so violently reordered
as to make direct violence no longer necessary. Once direct violence has
established liberal space, pacification functions as a structure of
violence that sustains the space. Direct violence only manifests itself
when pacification weakens.

Pacification, however, does not merely operate through manipulating the
conscience of its subjects. While Marxist and Gramscian concepts of
ideology and hegemony are consistent with our theory of pacification
(Peceny 1997, 418), they do not address how the constructed political
order sustains itself through a violent reordering of social relations.
A Gramscian-inspired critique of the democratic peace can yield a
bird's-eye view of the ways in which liberal peace theory is itself
deployed as an ideological tool (Ish-Shalom 2006, 569--75). However,
Gramscianinspired approaches do not account for the ways that everyday
practices of violence (for example, surveillance technologies, implied
threats from weapons, security barriers, etc.) sustain liberal
pacification. While ideational factors are important in pacification,
these factors rest upon practices and structures that are of an
ontological-existential character. To review, our reinterpretation of
the liberal peace as liberal pacification offers three novel insights.
First, [liberal scholars]{.underline} and others [associate the
development of the liberal order with peace and a decline in violence by
**ignoring** how pacification is part of the liberal
project]{.underline}. Second, [the empirically observed decline in
violence equated with the liberal peace is **not necessarily a sign of
human progress** but could be a sign of **intensified repression** or
**increases in other forms of suffering** across the liberal world
order]{.underline}. Third, our concept of [pacification reveals violence
that is neither direct nor indirect but is **phenomenologically
structured** into the world order. Understanding liberalism as
pacification produces a **paradigm shift**. Liberal pacification is
violent in the sense that it coerces a specific type of liberal
docility, while also preventing types of resistance that might be
understood as violent]{.underline}, including riots, insurrections,
civil wars, and interstate wars. [Pacification **reveals the ongoing
violence** at the heart of a political project that imagines itself to
be against violence.]{.underline}

Conclusion

Our account of pacification recovers a crucial aspect of pax, one
originally etched into Roman monuments. The heading of the Res Gestae
(the funeral monument to Emperor Augustus) reads, "\[t\]his is how he
\[Augustus\] made the world subject to the power of the people of Rome"
(Beard 2016, 364). This monument does not celebrate peace as the absence
of violence; it celebrates pacification. Pax takes the form of a process
that violently reorders the world so that imperial subjects are rendered
incapable of using violence to resist Roman rule. The absence of overt
acts of violence depends upon the maximization of pacification.

The practice of [pacification includes **threats**, **coercion**,
**intimidation**, and **surveillance** to restructure and sustain social
and political relations]{.underline}. When this type of violence
operates effectively, it appears as the absence of violence;
[pacification's violence resides in the structuring of the prevailing
order. While such an outcome **may appear peaceful**, it entails, at
best, a **negative peace** that operates through a **violent** and
**coercive reordering** of society.]{.underline}

[Liberal peace advocates measure direct violence and equate the decline
in that kind of violence with peace]{.underline}. However, our claim is
that [the spread of liberal institutions **does not necessarily decrease
violence** but **transforms it**. Our phenomenological analysis
**captures empirical trends** in human domination and suffering that
liberal peace theories **fail to account for**, including **increased
inequality**, **slavery**, **anxiety**, **addiction**, and
**anomie**]{.underline}. Our analysis also highlights how [a decline in
direct violence **may actually coincide** with the **transformation of
violence** in ways that are **concealed**, **monopolized**, and
**structured into the fabric of modern liberal society**]{.underline}.
If our theory is correct, [we will find **increases in markers of
suffering** as society liberalizes]{.underline}. While we cannot say
whether these indicators are unique to pacified liberal societies, it is
significant that they are rarely, if ever, discussed in terms of
violence and the liberal peace.

[Liberal pacification is **observationally equivalent** to liberal
peace. This is **not a semantic argument**. Liberal peace advocates
claim that processes that promote]{.underline} individual freedom and
autonomy (that is, [democracy, free markets, and global
institutions]{.underline}) [cause peace. While the **restructuring of
the global order**---**pacification**---**reduces direct violence**, it
also **restructures social relations** in ways that are violent.
Declines in directly observable violence **render other forms of
violence invisible** as violence; in fact, insidious, coercive, and
**violent systems of military deterrence** and **compellence**,
**nuclear terror**, **surveillance**, and **intimidation constitute the
worldhood** of the liberal order]{.underline}.

[Discursive closure, hegemony, and deep structure power]{.underline}

[The four themes above do not distinguish deliberate from accidental
acts of closure. When power is direct or strategic, we might witness
deliberate construction of coercive systems and production of messages
that are intended to be highly persuasive or manipulative]{.underline}.
We can also see more "soft conditioning," whereby the coercion is
subtler. [On the other hand, when ideologies become part of the
taken-for-granted infrastructures or institutionalized through
organizational and cultural norms, power is more distributed. At this
point, **ideologies embedded** in **everyday discourses**,
materialities, and infrastructures function to self-regenerate. **Power
becomes hegemonic** because both the control mechanisms and the
ideologies are invisible, naturalized, and then neutralized. Henceforth,
the origin of power is not nearly as relevant as its
function]{.underline}. As Gross (2010) writes, "\[[i\]t is the
pervasiveness of hegemonic regimes, so deeply embedded and variously
expressed in social, political, economic, and cultural institutions"
that makes change so difficult]{.underline} (p. 341).

[The theme of **inevitability** is an embedded and **invisible
ideology** of **technological determinism**]{.underline}. It takes a
different shape than when Marshall McLuhan was telling us the medium is
the message. [This continuously repeated mantra of powerlessness to
avoid what is inevitable is not just something we invent; it is learned
(or taught) in micro doses through our news feeds]{.underline}. [The
power of this discourse operates not only on the surface of everyday
talk about such matters but at what those of us in critical
organizational communication call deep structure levels of
discourse]{.underline} (e.g. Mumby, 1988). It can also be a hidden
curriculum, as Duffy and Chan (2019) aptly note, buried in the material
functioning of the interfaces themselves as well as the imagined
affordances we are building into their features.

[This **theme of inevitability** teaches us that our present and
possible futures are being determined by technology. The future world is
likely to be **dystopian**, but we do not really have a choice, since it
is an either/or proposition:]{.underline} We are either connected to
social media or we do not exist. At least as expressed for the past 3
years by dozens of participants in MoRM[, **technology development** is
on a trajectory that **cannot stop**. Within this overarching imaginary,
people should expect more and **more** **encapsulation** into black
boxed algorithmic systems that may not work perfectly or represent us
well. The momentum is carried and **controlled by the technology**
itself, since individuals are disqualified from critically analyzing
them]{.underline} (after all, even the programmers of algorithms cannot
comprehend exactly how they work).

[**Inevitability and powerlessness** are deeply connected to the concept
or **perception of control**. Participants had different ways of
embracing or dismissing the presence of technologies that control how we
operate or communicate on a daily basis.]{.underline} But throughout the
MoRM workshops, the overall trend was to connect the concept of control
with two other concepts: neutralization and naturalization.
[Naturalization occurs when we accept current elements of sociotechnical
contexts as simply "**just the way it is**."]{.underline} Even a 3-meter
scroll of the MoRM Terms of Services (TOS) (copied from a prominent
social networking company in 2-point font) did not shock many people,
since they were quite familiar with the need to simply agree to terms
they had no intention of reading, even if it were easy enough to
comprehend. Not one of the hundreds of participants we interacted with
failed to sign our TOS.

[Over time, the **naturalization** of objects, processes, or systems
also neutralizes them]{.underline}. While Star and Bowker would detail
this as "infrastructuring," [critical communication theorists would
focus on the control or hegemonic power that can emerge from a habitual
practice of perceiving or responding such elements of the lifeworld as
if they are valuefree]{.underline}. Through MoRM, [we can see how the
**naturalization process** removes agency from all parties, human or
not, effectively making it **impossible to assign responsibility**,
blame, or accountability. This **neutralization extends broadly** to all
aspects of the technical interface, the companies behind these, and the
people using these capabilities]{.underline}. Rather than assessing how
this understanding of control as external to the self is developed
ideologically, we can use it as a lens through which to trace whose
interests are maintained. We can ask: [**Who benefits the most** from
**widespread narrative** that the **digital revolution** is upon us,
**digital futures are inevitable**, and there is no way to stop,
reconsider, or rethink the current configurations?]{.underline}

Self-regulation and the limits of the imagination

[**Everyday discursive practices and materialities are powerful** not
just because they have remarkable potential to persuade others to think
and act differently, but also because they operate in such
**unremarkable ways**. Most of us do not recognize that we are **shaping
social structures** when we go about the **business of everyday
life.**]{.underline}

Let's think about the worldwide resurgence of "fascism." Donald Trump,
Matteo Salvini, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage, Vladimir Putin, and Recep
Erdoğan. Are they fascists? No, they are not. And the process that is
expanding in large parts of the world, is this fascism? No, it is not.

Fascism was a historic phenomenon comprised of young people. It was a
movement based on the will-to-power of a strong, energetic, futuristic
movement. [[It involved people who expected a bright future]{.mark}, and
promoted expansion, the colonization of territories and markets. Nobody
expects a bright future nowadays]{.underline}. [And [expansion is no
longer possible because the entire planet is subjugated]{.mark}, while
markets are saturated. The colonization of territorial spaces is
over---**[only time can be colonized]{.mark} nowadays**]{.underline}.
**[[The only direction for expansion]{.mark} today [is the
intensification of time and the acceleration of]{.mark} mental
[rhythms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [**[Only the virtual expansion of
cognitive space and the accelerated circulation of]{.mark} signs is
possible**. But **[this]{.mark}** kind of **[intensification is blowing
up]{.mark} the [nervous systems]{.mark} of humankind**]{.underline}.

Forty years ago, I remember shouting, "No future! No future!" with some
young British musicians. I thought it was the provocation of a unlikely
avant-garde. [Now, everybody thinks that the future is over; now, the
sentiment aligns with a conformist position held by most of
humankind]{.underline}. "No future" has become common sense, and [this
is why cynicism is expanding in contemporary culture, in contemporary
political behavior]{.underline}. [[Futurism was the expression of a
society that expected something from the future]{.mark}, and of a
society that truly felt the warmth of community, whether encapsulated in
the nation, the family, or social ties to working
communities]{.underline}. All the above was the reality of lived
experience a hundred years ago. No more! [Today, [the nation is a
nonexistent thing]{.mark}. The dissolution of the nation is an effect of
the pervasive digitalization of information and of power based on
information]{.underline}. [**[Do you think that Google belongs to the
United States? Not at all. The United States belongs to the territory of

[**[National sovereignty has been dissolved by the virtual ubiquity of
power]{.mark}**; **[the nation has come back]{.mark} as a myth, as an
aggressive form of identification, [as nostalgic
rage]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Belonging has been transformed into a]{.mark} hopeless
[nostalgia]{.mark} that is at the root of contemporary
supremacism]{.underline}. [[Supremacism is an expression of]{.mark}
older [people's fears]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [[it is because
they fear migration that they view it as an
invasion]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[And, largely, it is an invasion. One or two hundred years ago, racism
was an integral part of the invasion by white people of the Southern
territories of the world. Nowadays, racism is the fearful reaction by
white people to the perceived invasion of their own territories. And the
racist paranoia of the great racial "substitution" is not merely a
phantom, because it corresponds to a real process]{.underline} (one that
is happening without the aid of a conspiracy involving George Soros).
The white race is---thank god---disappearing. This is the root of
contemporary supremacism, which is simultaneously impotent and
hyper-powerful; it is unable to change a future of certain decline, but
at the same time it is perfectly able to destroy the world in desperate
acts that aim to reassert a potency that has vanished.

"[Impotence" is the word that explains what is happening, particularly
in the Northern parts of the planet. Impotence and the desire for
revenge]{.underline}. The neoliberal left has destroyed any possible
expectation of a political transformation for the future. [[The

reason is the financial algorithm, the only thing that we can expect

against reason in the preface to The Dialectic of

[Throughout the short history of cyberwar]{.underline}, [the **vast
majority** of attacks have taken place **outside** of declared
conflicts]{.underline} and kinetic wars. It is striking, then, that if
we follow both the media and military establishments in calling these
events war, [war appears **no longer** to exist in a specific time or
place]{.underline}. If [cyberwar]{.underline} is taken in its broadest
sense to mean a new mode of war targeted against systems, it then [marks
a **new relationship** to the space and time of war and attests to the
reconfiguration of global spaces]{.underline} by economic, legal,
social, and military forces. [While many are **quick** to see in
cyberwar an **inevitable apocalyptic catastrophe**]{.underline}, [and
while others **dismiss** these warnings as **pure hype**]{.underline},
[it is **most productive** to **set aside that particular debate** and
instead explore the **specific logic** of cyberwar]{.underline}. Under
the logic of computer and network-based attacks, [certain tendencies
of]{.underline} military and economic [thinking]{.underline} about the
global space of the twenty-first century [come to the fore
**regardless** of the **ultimate success** or **failure**
of]{.underline} these [computerized attacks]{.underline}.

Cyberwar exploits security gaps in digital systems and networks and at
the same time leverages the global reach of these networks. The attacks
that have been organized under the name of cyberwar create nearly
immediate effects at a distance, sending information and malicious code
around the globe at the speed of light. Cyberwar exists intimately
within what Castells calls "the rise of the network society."1 These
attacks on networked digital systems both speak to and engage with these
increasingly connected global spaces. Moreover, even while these attacks
exploit the vulnerabilities of programs, they are exploited by and in
order to leverage spatial and temporal networks. To understand what is
at stake in cyberwar, especially as it moves outside the time and space
of declared war, requires us to account for these shifts in geography
and for the impact of cyberwar on the continual reconfiguration of
geography and networks.

[This transformation of global space through networks does not mark the
**end** of geography]{.underline}. Rather, [geographic space is
**supplemented** by networks of computers]{.underline},
[trade]{.underline}, [international law]{.underline},
[migrations]{.underline}, [and so on]{.underline}, some of which
privilege flows, speed, and networked contiguity, while others privilege
place, slowness, and disconnection. [Cyberwar]{.underline} takes place
across and between this entire set of geographic and networked spaces.
Twenty-first-century military and political strategy **[does not give up
on geopolitics]{.underline}**; rather, [it engages a **multiplicity** of
spaces and domains]{.underline}. Within these spaces, certain nodes are
selected as sites of intervention for their importance to the multitude
of networks of which they are part. In a sense, [though territory does
not **disappear**]{.underline}, [it becomes **another type of node** in
a global set of interwoven networks]{.underline}. Hence warfare, and
especially [cyberwar]{.underline}, [**ceases** to be **exclusively
territorial**]{.underline} ([if it **ever was**]{.underline}) [and
becomes primarily concerned with **networks**]{.underline}. If territory
is merely another node in a variety of networks, then war and politics
have always been nodal, but what arises with cyberwarfare is a
purposeful attempt to explicate and strategize a nodal politics. Thus we
must attempt to interrogate the logic of cyberwar as it fixes upon this
networked time and space of global politics.

#### Cyberwar [distorts]{.underline} the [idea]{.underline} of the nation.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko 19**(Nick and Svitlana, Associate
professor at the University of Western Ontario, Professor of
Communications at Simon Fraser University "Cyberwar and Revolution",

[A state's interpellation of its subjects]{.underline}, or of the
subjects of another state, [is in part a question of its cyberwar
apparatuses' access to or interdiction from specific
platforms]{.underline}. Though [platforms]{.underline} may be more or
less global or local in scope, they [are also national, in terms of
ownership and legal governance and relations to a homeland state
security apparatus]{.underline}. This is a dynamic around which the
profit interests of specific blocs of digital capital and political
interests of security state apparatuses mutually revolve
(Google/Facebook/Twitter for the United States; VKontakte/ Yandex for
Russia; Weibo/Baidu/Tencent for China). "[National" interpellation of
state subjects is manifestly in play in the banning by the Ukraine
government of Russian social media and search engines in the midst of an
ongoing war]{.underline}. It may also, however, manifest when military
conflict is merely anticipated, as we saw in chapter 1 in regard to the
"Sino-Google war" (Bratton 2016, 112) and its imbrication in
intensifying China--United States hostilities. However, [cyberwar
subjectification is not simply a question of demarcating "national"
platforms and "national" identities. The profit dynamics of Web 2.0
capital demand both an ever-enlarging user base and the
self-activit]{.underline}y (and hence self-revelation) [of
users]{.underline}. Because of this, it is possible to construct within
social media interpellative micromachines, that is to say, specific user
communities, as a sort of "partisan" presence inside ostensibly foreign
digital territory. [Within Facebook, one can form a nation, or a
caliphate, or perhaps even an assembly or commune]{.underline}.
[Platforms]{.underline} owned by capital of another state, even an
adversary state, [can be seeded with subversive practices or used as
digital territories across which wars are fought between other competing
states]{.underline}, as the Gaza conflict was digitally fought out
across Twitter. [The truly global social media platforms, owned by U.S.
capital, are particularly liable to this process, precisely to the
degree that their huge profitability depends on amassing global
users]{.underline}. This [cyberwar seeding of subjectification involves
agents]{.underline}. These are of various kinds: [state military public
relations agencies,]{.underline} such as the IDF's Spokesperson's Unit
(now being widely copied by other militaries); [clandestine troll
armies, such]{.underline} as those of Russia's Internet Research Agency;
U[.S. military "sock puppets"; or ISIS militant recruiters]{.underline}.
The efforts of such agents may also be articulated with autonomous
interpellative processes, such as those of dissenting movements within
foreign states or citizen journalists with a spontaneous patriotism for
the homeland. [Agents may work positively, as "friends"; negatively,
harassing enemies; or in contradictory, chaotic directions, generating a
paralyzing anomic blur.]{.underline} Each of these comes with its own
interpellative processes. For example, [one can contrast the careful
cultivation of the subject of an ISIS recruitment process with trolling
practices associated with Russian hybrid warfare.]{.underline} In the
former process, recruiters "monitor online communities where they
believe they can find receptive individuals," sifting through visitors
to militant sites. They then create a warm virtual microcommunity around
potential recruits, saturating them with messages that, depending on the
orientation of the target, may emphasize religious devotion, the appeal
of violent action, grievances against racism, religious discrimination,
poor economic prospects, or positive depictions of life in militant-held
territories. At the same time, they encourage the potential recruit to
isolate himself from other contacts. At a certain point, communication
shifts from public forums into private and encrypted channels. It is in
this phase that options such as emigration to ISIS territory, as a
civilian or fighter, or attacks at home are discussed. The cycle is a
sustained, modulated "hailing" of an identified data subject as a
supporter of the caliphate, a data relation that then translates into
corporeal action (Berger 2015a, 2015b).9 [Cyberwar trolling]{.underline}
is an interpellation that reverses the logic of recruiting. [An enemy,
rather than a friend, is identified, vilified, enraged, exhausted, and
metaphorically]{.underline} (and sometimes literally, through "doxing"
and the like) [destroyed, silenced, intimidated, or forced
offline]{.underline}---with the correct subject position established
negatively, in contrast to that of the unfortunate and despicable
victim. While the term is loosely applied to many forms of online
harassment, it is often more specifically used to characterize a
strategy of escalating rancorous dissensus, for example, making a
provocation that can be bootstrapped into intensifying abuse and insult.
In this form, trolling is sometimes analyzed as having a distinct
sequence; the lure, the catch, reeling in, and so on. It may be
practiced solo or in teams (with one troll reinforcing another or making
an apparently innocent conversational setup that can later be exploited)
and can involve a number of gambits (such as professing support for a
position but then undercutting it with damning "concerns["). Thus, for
example, on a nationalist Ukraine internet forum, pro-Russian trolling
can ramp up from an apparently measured remark about U.S. support for
Ukraine to intensifying attacks on Ukraine's corrupt incapacity for
self-governance, Western homosexual degeneracy, ubiquitous fascism,
cowardice, and inevitable defeat.]{.underline} The subjectifying address
is "if you are like that, you are worthless; you don't want to be like
them, the \[redacted\]/fascists/CIA dupes, but like us, your brave
Slavic brothers" (Szwed 2016).

### AT: Perm

#### The perm fails---sequencing is key. Refocusing our priorities is [necessary]{.underline}.

But post-Snowden controversies also show that these forms of resistance
create a risk that we will overlook the pervasiveness of the
institutions and technologies, of the rationalities and practices that
created the problem in the first place. [The risk is that all we are
able to come up with are legal, technological or bureaucratic fixes to
try to contain the most disturbing aspects of data-driven bureaucracies,
without affecting the longer-term trend of a technological arms race
that only seems to intensify the issues it was allegedly meant to
solve.]{.underline}

[Some kind of deeper resistance might be warranted]{.underline}. In his
writings on power, Foucault once asked: "How can the growth of
capabilities" -- and he explicitly mentioned "techniques of
communication -- "be disconnected from the intensification of power
relations?" (Foucault 1984, 48). [Computing technologies have since
become immensely powerful and yet, we are still struggling to find a
satisfactory answer to this crucial question.]{.underline} Despite the
hopes of early hackers and Internet pioneers, [the decoupling of
technology and power is not happening.]{.underline} [**The key
question** then becomes whether **technology itself or law or ethics can
actually be effective** instruments to **achieve such
decoupling**.]{.underline}

At this stage of technological development, if we feel like they cannot
-- at least not in the near foreseeable future -- [that means it is
probably time to **refocus on tackling the imaginaries and
institutions** that **underlie the "growth of capabilities**" itself:
the]{.underline} blind [**\[uncritical\] faith in technological
progress**;]{.underline} [the oft-repeated mantra that technology is
neutral, that its negative potential will somehow be contained; places
like the universities, R&D labs, ministries, start-ups, shops and
factories where complex and powerful technologies are designed, produced
and traded.]{.underline} As philosopher Jacques Ellul observed, "[**we
set huge machines in motion** in order **to arrive
nowhere**"]{.underline} (Ellul 1989, 51). If it is not Thomas More's
eu-topia ("no place") [that we are **fast approaching** but rather **a
"dystopian void**"]{.underline} (The Luddbrarian 2018), [what we need is
not just a **technological fix, a bureaucratic patch, a principled law
or even a good ethics**; **what we need first and foremost is to get off
and stop the machine.**]{.underline}

#### Fantasies DA: the perm [reinvests]{.underline} in the cybernetic dream of perfectly self-organizing markets. Refusing their [fantasy]{.underline} of cybernetic control is both [necessary]{.underline} and [sufficient]{.underline}.

**Halpern, 22**---associate professor in sociology and anthropology at
Concordia University (Orit, "The Future Will Not Be Calculated: Neural
Nets, Neoliberalism, and Reactionary Politics," Critical Inquiry, Volume
48, Number 2, Winter 2022, dml)

It is perhaps an irony of history that [the answer to]{.underline} this
problem of overinundation and [data surplus appeared to be a turn to
**cybernetics**]{.underline}, new models of networked cognition,
[and]{.underline} ultimately perhaps even a new model of [machine
learning that might]{.underline} indeed [learn from the distributed
intelligence of]{.underline} millions, and now
**[billions]{.underline}**, of people. At the same time, such
technologies make it impossible to encounter the very legitimate sources
of pain in contemporary societies whether induced by structural racism,
poverty, disease, or environmental degradation.

This returns us to our present. If Hayek and Hebb still worried about
liberal subjects and objectivity, we might ask what concerns animate our
contemporary networks? Markets, and now reactionary politics, seek
instability and discrimination but without diversity. Shock has been
normalized to be managed through our electronic networks.
[Networks]{.underline} appear to [have the power to **exacerbate
fantasies** of individual control and **paranoid imaginaries** of
agential patterns]{.underline}. If "**[shock]{.underline}**" for Klein
was a mechanism to destabilize systems and nations to allow the entry of
neoliberal governance, we might extend her observation to recognize that
now it [has become a tool to **maintain existing neoliberal systems**
and to encourage the **growth** and **proliferation** of]{.underline}
machine learning [**networks** and **algorithmic
finance**]{.underline}.58

I opened this article by arguing that [cybernetics]{.underline} and its
affiliated communication and human sciences [aspired to the
**elimination of**]{.underline} political and psychological [**trauma**
through a dream of self-organizing systems and autopoietic
intelligences]{.underline} produced from the minute actions of small,
stupid, logic gates, [a dream of a world of networks without
limit]{.underline}, focused eternally on an indefinite and extendable
but never-defined future that might be consumed in the present. [This
dream may now be **partially realized**]{.underline}, [and we have to
generate a **new set of fantasies**]{.underline}.

[To do so does **not**]{.underline}, however, [mean
wishing]{.underline}, [like **reactionary politicians**]{.underline},
[to return to a **mythic past**]{.underline}. [It does **not** denote
fantasizing a **Cartesian ethics** with **transparent algorithms** and
**no black boxes**]{.underline}. [To do so would only be to **replicate
the reactionary logic** of the database]{.underline}, where processes of
distinction and inevitably discrimination are stored only to be
retrieved without consciousness or history.

[Nor does it mean **evading** the power we have bequeathed from our
machines]{.underline}. [The apparatus]{.underline} of the epistemology
of the neural net [has opened]{.underline} to both **[positive
potentials]{.underline}**---[neurodiversity]{.underline},
[plasticity]{.underline}, [and new forms of
collectivity]{.underline}---[even as it has enhanced the
**financialization** of life and the **necropolitics** of neoliberal
economics]{.underline}. As Randy Martin has argued, rather than
separating itself from social processes of production and reproduction,
algorithmic finance demonstrates the increased interrelatedness,
globalization, and socialization of debt and precarity. By tying
together disparate actions and objects into a single assembled bundle of
reallocated risks to trade, the [new market machines make us **more
indebted**]{.underline} both [to each other]{.underline}. [The
**political** and **ethical question** thus becomes how we might
**activate** this increased indebtedness in **new ways**]{.underline},
ones [that are **less amenable** to the **strict market logics** of
neoliberal economics]{.underline}.59

Hayek, himself, gestured to this possibility within his own thought.
Markets he argued, demand difference: "From the fact that people are
very different it follows that, if we treat them equally, the result
must be inequality in their actual position, and that the only way to
place them in an equal position would be to treat them differently.
Equality before the law and material equality are therefore not only
different but are in conflict with each other; and we can achieve either
the one or the other, but not both at the same time."60 With these words
he stated the fundamental dilemma of neoliberalism: to be free we must
be put in relation to each other. But he also wavers: Does liberty
denote equal treatment, and therefore a generic law, or differential and
situated treatment, which might denote planning or coercion? The
response of neoliberal discourse has been to automate this relation,
thus obscuring its social character, and extract value from the
differences between humans while maintaining that such relations emerge
evolutionarily and thus are nonintentional but natural and necessary.

[Might this discourse be disrupted?]{.underline} Recalling the argument
that difference is the foundation for freedom or liberty, [can we
**push** this neoliberal imaginary until it **folds**?]{.underline}
[This tension might be the source of a **possible freedom** through
relations]{.underline}, if they are historically situated. [The
**fantasy**]{.underline} of an archive of processes of differentiation
[might be **mobilized to new ends**]{.underline}--- mainly [to
recognizing the **permeable**]{.underline}, **[political]{.underline}**,
[and **situated nature** of social orders]{.underline}. [The
future]{.underline}, I argue, [lies in recognizing what our machines
have **finally made visible**]{.underline}, what has perhaps always been
there, mainly [the **sociopolitical nature** of our seemingly natural
thoughts and perceptions]{.underline}. [In that all computer systems are
**programmed**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} therefore
**[planned]{.underline}**, [we are also forced to contend with the
**intentional** and therefore **changeable** nature of how we both think
and perceive our world]{.underline}.

### AT: State Good

#### State rhetoric under the illusory guise of technological solutionism covertly perpetrates structural violence.

[Stopping the machine?]{.underline} That [begs the question of how best
to **challenge these new security assemblages**]{.underline}.

For one thing, it is worth stressing that [Big Data bureaucracies might
not be that good at doing what they are supposed to.]{.underline} We can
[therefore oppose the arguments of those legitimising these new
governance models on the grounds of accuracy and
reliability.]{.underline} There are reasons -- and [**growing evidence**
-- to **doubt** that the new "**regimes of truth"** championed by "**Big
Data security assemblages**" will in any meaningful way **provide
solutions to security issues** (]{.underline}Aradau and Blanke 2015).
**[Technological solutionism]{.underline}** [in the age of data
governance, bolstered by marketing discourses, might only be
**recreating a veil of illusion of technocratic control,** while
**putting evermore distance between bureaucracies and the social world**
they wish to make more orderly]{.underline}. After all, **[history tells
us, bureaucracies tend to fail.]{.underline}** [By disregarding "all the
subtleties of real social existence," "reducing everything to
preconceived mechanical or statistical formulae," bureaucratic
dispositifs like "forms, rules, statistics, or questionnaire" -- even
when fuelled by complex algorithms and troves of data]{.underline} --,
remain abstract simplifications that might [only **reinforce the forms
of structural violence** they are **said to alleviate or even
solve**]{.underline} (Graeber 2015, p. 75; see also Eubanks 2018, O'Neil
2016).

[**Bureaucracies often fail** to meet their alleged goals but still,
they **strengthen the power of those who invest in them.** They
transform the social world and can **go awfully wrong**]{.underline}
(Scott 1998). If, following Tim Mitchell and critical security scholars,
[we **refuse to "see the state and private organizations as a single,
totalized structure of power,"** another complementary way of
**resisting these assemblages** is to **build on the conflicts that
inevitably occur** "between different government agencies, between
corporate organizations, and within each of them"]{.underline} (Mitchell
1991, 90). **[We can amplify the words]{.underline}** [of those who
**denounce the oppressive and manipulative use** of **modern computer
technologies**,]{.underline} [**applaud tech workers opposing** the
direct involvement of their company in the military-industrial complex,
or support security professionals seeking to **automate intelligence
oversight** so as to catch up with large-scale surveillance systems and
**mitigate abuse**. **We can, and we should.**]{.underline}

### AT: Tech Good---Education

#### Technology is the vessel of authoritarian algorithmic control that reinforce patriarchal notions of power and inequality.

The Authoritarian Reproduction of Higher Education

Increasingly, HE labourers are co-opted into the implementation of
disciplinary technologies, or technologies designed to control the
classroom for value. [The integration of learning environment, pedagogy,
identity, and technology strips-back autonomy as fows of performance
data provide ongoing, **formative feedback to systems** of **algorithmic
governance**.]{.underline} **[Independence is reduced]{.underline}**
beyond the ability to provide feedback on behaviour and activity[, in
order to fulfl the desires of particular ideological conceptions of
HE]{.underline}. Where behaviour and activity are wilful, they are
constantly fnessed or managed out of the system (Ahmed 2019). Thus, the
digital ecosystems of HE embed competitive techniques and manage risk
through behavioural reengineering.

Ideologically, structures and processes are used to make claims focused
upon accountability with performance-based incentives, and a commitment
to the idea of a meritocracy, through which resources can fow to
structures and service units focused upon particular kinds of teaching
and research performance. However, it is important to remember that
[**technologies are used against labour** by **structuring and
accelerating work,** and the emotional, social, and embodied costs of
extended or **intensifed work** '**ultimately falls on the workers** who
make the machine hum]{.underline}' (Phillips and Rozworski 2019: 89).
[**Algorithmic control cares little** for social negotiation or
discussions of the **fows of power or inequality**]{.underline}
(McQuillan 2016; Pasquale 2018).

Both curriculum and research practices are overlain with
institutionalised technologies that monitor and allow judgements to be
made. This includes those for facial recognition and app-enabled
attendance monitoring via Wi-Fi tethering (Andrejevic and Selwyn 2020;
Meneses et al. 2019), which are marketed in terms of campus security,
progression, and retention, but which damage or restrict free
expression, privacy, and autonomy (Fight for the Future 2020). The
utilisation of such technologies is framed around tracking the
individual in response to their actions and location, with judgements
imposed about legitimacy, behaviour, and identity. Where behaviours and
identities do not match dominant norms, there is an additional layer of
injustice in the deployment of the digital ecosystem, in particular
given the lack of algorithmic accuracy in addressing people of colour
and women, alongside non-binary and trans people (Grother et al. 2019).
This is amplifed because the collection of sensitive biometric data is
intrusive and tends to lack consent, even whilst information about
individuals, contacts, behaviour, feelings, and practices is sequestered
and re-purposed (Pasquale 2016).

[Such **technologies are authoritarian** not simply in terms of their
governance and the ways in which **they maintain systemic order** in the
face of uncertainty directed for the production of economic
value]{.underline}. They are also disciplinary in that they [quantify
human lives and experiences, construct particular identities based on
dominant norms, and then enforce the internalisation of that
quantifcation/construction]{.underline} (Stark 2019[). They **form a
terrain of necropolitics** that **makes invisible certain bodies**, or
makes their existence **a form of living death**]{.underline} (Mbembe
2019). [The process of making invisible is **shaped by institutional
formations** that **serve to benchmark individuals**, subjects, and
institutions, **pivoting around** **human capital
formation**]{.underline} (World Bank Group Education 2020). This demands
structures that can measure, monitor, and report learning outcomes and
implement action plans predicated upon generating commodity and leverage
graduate skills and contributing to innovation, across a comparable,
international terrain.

[The **institution**, whether postdigital or not, **makes it diffcult
for individuals** and groups t**o move beyond these fows of powe**r, or
to **challenge them collectively**]{.underline}. [There has been an
**emptying out of the politics of the University** in the face of the
disciplinary imperatives of commodity production and
exchange]{.underline}. This means that any meaningful analysis of the
humanist potential of a postdigital HE has to recognise its increasingly
authoritarian policy and practice-based context, including:

• struggles in 2020 against cuts to humanities and social sciences
courses that are deemed low-value, for instance at the universities of
Sunderland and Portsmouth in the UK;

• struggles by graduate students at the University of California, Santa
Cruz, taking part in wildcat strikes since 2019 to demand living wages;

• struggles in 2019 at the University of Juba in South Sudan against
tuition fee hikes that threatened the right to education;

• the history of protest at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi,
including the 2016 sedition row, and 2019 struggles over accommodation
fees and India's Citizenship Amendment Act;

• the hostile environment created by institutional engagement with
national immigration practices like the Prevent Duty in the UK;

• the use of court injunctions to halt demonstrations on campuses;

• media panics over issues like grade infation, which are presented as
threats to the value of a degree or of higher education composition;
and,

• discourses around free speech predicated upon disciplining specifc
bodies and communities.

These struggles are responses to policy narratives that deform and
re-purpose the epistemic role of HE in society. They enable us to
analyse any postdigital conceptualisation of HE in relation to the
authoritarian characteristics of the forms or structures of HE, its
cultures or pathologies, and its activities or methodologies.

• First, the form or structure of the University or College develops in
order to maintain the ideological repositioning of social reproduction
around ordered liberties rather than democratic rights. Thus, HE gives
individuals the liberty to develop their own human capital and that of
their families, and any rights they have are rooted in the deployment of
that human capital for entrepreneurial, value-driven ends (Bruff and
Tansel 2018).

• Second, [the cultures that emerge from these structures pathologically
**reinforce inequality** in access to collective, public goods, based
upon **dominant, patriarchal notions of productivity**]{.underline}
(Bruff 2014). In order to consume social goods, individuals are expected
to deliver value-for-money and to be economically productive, in ways
that are defned hegemonically in relation to white, male, ableist,
heterosexual norms.

• Third, these pathologies recalibrate social relationships in the name
of markets through labour market reforms and regulation that supports
corporate forms, such that the regulation and governance of
institutions, data and justice is focused upon the production and
circulation of value, rather than shared values (Connell 2013).

• Fourth, the terrain of HE is re-engineered methodologically, through
commodifcation to enable the corporate parasitisation of notionally
public organisations, through ideologies, policies, and practices of
privatisation, marketisation, and fnancialization (Davies 2017). As a
result, the activities of HE, like the production of textbooks,
articles, and ways of knowing the world, become commodities that can be
exchanged.

[These characteristics interact through fows of data and digital lives,
in order to discipline specifc kinds of useful knowledge and a specifc
kind of useful knowledge producer, in relation to the **authoritarian
reproduction of value**]{.underline}. It is in this context that
postdigital HE takes shape.

### AT: Tech Good---Info Tech

#### Despite potential positive uses of technology, information tech has fueled radicalization and violence.

Forum on Peace and Development and Researcher at SIPRI. Her previous
positions have included Director of Academic Affairs at Lead University,

Accessed 7-4-2022, RS).

[Human rights activists have used social media technology to organize
peaceful protests and defend democracy for more than a decade. More
recently, peacebuilders have discovered it can be a tool to understand
conflict dynamics and counter extremism better. Yet the potential of
social media as a megaphone for promoting human rights, democracy and
peace is overshadowed by its dismal record of being used to drive
radicalization and violence through disinformation
campaigns]{.underline}. This 'online frontline' will continue to be the
case, unless regulators, social media firms and citizens revisit current
policies and practices.

At the 2021 Stockholm Forum on Peace and Development researchers,
policymakers, tech companies and civil society organizations had an
opportunity to explore how social media can be harnessed for
peacebuilding purposes and to assess policy responses to harmful online
disinformation campaigns. This Topical Backgrounder is inspired by these
discussions, particularly on the Janus-faced nature of social media. It
makes four recommendations---one each for peacebuilding practitioners,
policymakers, social media companies and citizens---to protect peace,
democratic institutions and people's welfare:

Peacebuilding practitioners should systematize the use of social media
technology for conflict stakeholder analysis, early warning,
counter-messaging and the defence of democracy and human rights;

Policymakers should stem harmful social media disinformation campaigns
by creating effective oversight and strict data management guidelines;

Tech companies should redesign their social media tools to prevent them
from being employed for harmful political ends and from favouring
conflict over consensus; and

Citizens should improve their resilience to disinformation, but also
demand insight into the information collected about them by social media
firms, how it is used and by whom.

Social media as a peacebuilding instrument

[Participants in the Stockholm Forum sessions highlighted four uses of
social media technology in peacebuilding research and practice: conflict
stakeholder analysis; early warning; counter-messaging; and social
mobilization for peaceful protest and democracy]{.underline}. However,
none of the four uses has yet fulfilled its potential.

Conflict stakeholder analysis

[Peace and conflict researchers increasingly examine social media
content to map conflict actors, trace the links between them and
identify their local support networks. This has greatly improved the
understanding of Nigeria's Boko Haram, for example]{.underline}, which
has relied on social media for its messaging since 2009.

Early warning

[Researchers also monitor social media content to gain better insights
into local grievances---a key driver of violence. In sub-Saharan Africa,
for example]{.underline}, local grievances have provided a fertile
ground for the expansion of extremist groups. [Tracking such grievances
online in real time can feed into early warning systems for
conflict.]{.underline}

Counter-messaging

[Young peacebuilders use social media platforms to develop viable
counter-messages to extremists]{.underline}. These are more likely to be
successful if grounded in local (sometimes high-risk) in-person
activities or activism.

Social mobilization for peaceful protest and democracy

[Social media technology has also created opportunities for people to
mobilize politically in defence of democracy and human rights. In 2009
in Moldova, for example, young people relied on Twitter to oppose the
country's communist leadership. In Iran, citizens used Twitter to
organize protests against the results of the 2009 presidential
election]{.underline}, leading to calls for Twitter to be considered for
the Nobel Peace Prize. [During the Arab Spring in 2011, protestors in
Egypt and Tunisia took to social media platforms to
organize]{.underline}, spread their message internationally and
ultimately overthrow dictatorial regimes. [Particularly in repressive
regimes, social media has been a communication channel for people to
stand up for human rights or share evidence of human rights
abuses]{.underline} thereby preventing government monopolization of
information. It is hence no coincidence that social media giants, such
as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, are blocked in China, Iran and North
Korea.

All four uses of social media could be employed a lot more strategically
to reap benefits for peacebuilders or human rights activists. [To date,
much of the hope connected to social media as a tool for human rights,
democracy and peace after the 2009 'Twitter revolutions' has subsided or
been replaced with concern about its potential to contribute to
conflict.]{.underline}

Social media as a driver of conflict

In the worst cases, [social media platforms have been used to suppress
internal dissent, meddle in democratic elections, incite armed violence,
recruit members of terrorist organizations or contribute to crimes
against humanity, as in the case of persecution of the Rohingya in
Myanmar]{.underline}. In 2020 there was evidence of social media
manipulation in 81 countries and of firms offering 'computational
propaganda' campaigns to political actors in 48 countries. While
propaganda is not new, the 2021 Stockholm Forum highlighted some of the
reasons why [propaganda on social media presents distinct challenges
compared to traditional media, unintentionally drives conflict or
affects peacebuilding efforts.]{.underline}

From news editors to tech companies

[The rise of news distribution and consumption via social media
platforms has shifted the gatekeeping power for information]{.underline}
dissemination from editors and journalists---bound by professional codes
of ethics, principles of limiting harm and editorial lines---[to tech
companies owing allegiance primarily to their shareholders]{.underline}.
Professional news outlets across the globe now 'compete with content
producers---domestic and international---who produce junk news that is
sensational, conspiratorial, extremist, and inflammatory commentary
packaged as news'. [Social media providers are currently protected
against liability for user content and have shied away from becoming
'arbiters of truth'.]{.underline}

Creation of echo chambers

To maximize profit by growing user engagement and participation, [social
media companies have created sophisticated tools which filter
information and place people in virtual echo chambers. These confirm or
even radicalize the users' world views]{.underline}. Currently, the
algorithms underlying social media platforms' business model amplify the
angry and divisive voices which drive engagement, pushing users towards
ever more extreme content.

Voter manipulation and offline violence

[The pigeonholing of information not only shapes people's world views,
but also their behaviour. The violent storming of the United States
Capitol Building in January 2021 was, in part, motivated by the false
widespread claim that the 2020 election was rigged]{.underline}.
Stockholm Forum speaker Aws Al-Saadi, the founder and CEO of
Tech4Peace---a large fact-checking network in the Middle East and North
Africa---explained how online rumours can kill and fake online news
about specific people in Iraq has sometimes prompted others to take
justice into their own hands. [Maria Ressa, CEO of online news outlet
Rappler in the Philippines, argued: 'Social media has become a behaviour
modification system. And we've become Pavlov's dogs that are
experimented on in real time. And the consequences are
disastrous.']{.underline}

Interference in conflict dynamics

It is also increasingly clear that [even well-meaning global social
media campaigns can interfere in conflict dynamics]{.underline}. A
recent article explained how, after an information leak, [the
international #BringBackOurGirls social media campaign to free the
high-school girls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Chibok in 2014 hindered
rescue attempts and may have encouraged the group's growing reliance on
gender violence]{.underline} and kidnapping for international attention
and ransom.

Risks to peacebuilders and humanitarian efforts

[Another prominent theme in several Stockholm Forum discussions was the
risk that adverse social media reactions pose to peacebuilders or
humanitarian efforts. For example, individuals working in projects with
colleagues from countries considered to be adversaries (Armenia/Turkey;
Armenia/Azerbaijan) cancelled their participation in these
collaborations after suffering personal attacks on social media.
Systematic online campaigns to defame humanitarian organizations are
another example]{.underline}. Between 2013 and 2017, hundreds of
humanitarian White Helmet volunteers were killed in Syria after
manufactured social media claims that they were terrorists with links to
al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.

### AT: Tech Good---Peace

#### Technology doesn't [reduce]{.underline} violence, but [obscures]{.underline} it as a failure to take advantage of liberal freedom. The impact is [permanent everywhere war]{.underline}.

**Johnson, 18**---Professor, Environmental History, Loyola University
Chicago (Benjamin, "Coded Conflict: Algorithmic and Drone Warfare in US
Security Strategy," Journal of Military and Strategic Studies, Volume
18, Issue 4, dml)

[Understanding technology as **more** than a neutral tool]{.underline}
that is exogenous to political and social life [has been]{.underline} an
**[important]{.underline}** site of intervention for critical theory,
especially [in understanding how technology interacts with social and
political existence to **obscure** and **perpetrate
violence**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} conceptual,
**[theoretical]{.underline}** and discursive [**underpinnings** of the
liberal peace]{.underline} [have been]{.underline} advanced and
**[critiqued]{.underline}** on a number of fronts. For example, [these
works have focused on the adherence of research to
**quantitative**]{.underline} '**[large-N]{.underline}**' [**statistical
testing** where the liberal peace is treated as a **scientific
phenomenon**]{.underline}; 35 [the role of]{.underline} liberal peace as
a 'tripartite international discursive environment' in which
**[superficial technical solutions]{.underline}** to resolve conflict
are produced; 36 [the]{.underline} '**[punitive ethos]{.underline}**'
[**inherent** to liberalism's normative influence]{.underline} on
counter-terrorism policy;37 [the **limits** to liberalism's
understanding of actors]{.underline} in terms of states and their
institutions;38 [the **inherent violence** of Western modernization and
its links to liberal peacebuilding]{.underline}; 39 [and]{.underline}
lastly [the **liberal character** of empire building through **imperial
expansion**]{.underline}.40

[This]{.underline} body of literature [has teased out the **implicit**
and **explicit** forms of violence that **underpin** liberal
internationalism]{.underline}. [Violence undertaken in the name of
spreading liberal democracy has **increasingly been exposed** and
**difficult to ignore**]{.underline}, especially as war has expanded
through visual representations and made available to people outside of
conflict zones.41 James Der Derian has gone so far to argue that with
respect to a global liberal project of civilizing the world, "in spite
of, and perhaps soon because of, efforts to spread a democratic peace
through globalization and humanitarian intervention, war is ascending to
an even higher plan, from the virtual to the virtuous."42 Commenting on
the discursive narrative that technology enabled distance has allowed
for a peaceful or 'clean' type of war, Der Derian goes on to argue that
"[at the **heart**]{.underline} of virtuous war [is the **technical
capability** and **ethical imperative** to threaten and]{.underline},
[if necessary actualize violence from a **distance**]{.underline} --
with no or minimal casualties" and that "on the surface, virtuous war
cleans up the political discourse as well as the battlefield \[\...\]
virtuous wars promote a vision of bloodless, humanitarian, hygienic
wars."43

[The notion that liberal war has **somehow become surgical** and
**bloodless** is linked to]{.underline} what a number of authors have
identified as [a shift from **government** to
**governance**]{.underline}. Rather than 'boots on the ground' and
active attempts at state building, [liberal interventionism has
**shifted** to emphasize the management of and engagement with
populations at a **distance**]{.underline}. Again, this should not be
understood as an altogether new phenomenon. Heathershaw argues that
liberal peacebuilding, while theoretically linked to Kant's notion of a
perpetual peace, is more recently linked to discourse that proliferated
at the end of the Cold War.44 Democratic peacebuilding was developed by
the United Nations (UN) along with its major donors and analysists in
the immediate post-Cold War period, which was understood as a "watershed
moment akin to 1919 or 1945", thus spawning the 'new interventionism'
that dominated policy rhetoric during the 1990s and early-2000s.45

However, along with this discourse [there has been a pronounced
shift]{.underline} in practice [towards increasing forms of
**bio-political governance**]{.underline} in the Foucaultian sense of
the term. For Dillon and Reid, "global liberal governance is
substantially comprised of [techniques that examine the **detailed
properties** and **dynamics** of populations so that they can be
**better managed**]{.underline} with respect to their many needs and
life chances" and where "biopolitics is the pursuit of war by other
means."46 Foucault has made a lasting contribution to the critique of
liberal security and war, which becomes especially useful in theorizing
current conflict environments. For Evans, [**life itself** becomes the
object of political strategies]{.underline}, which holds implications in
terms of security. 47 Echoing Dillon and Reid, Evans states that "in the
process of making life live, \[those general strategies for effecting
power\] entail the regulation of populations for society's overall
betterment."48

The notion of 'bettering' society is implicated in the idea that freedom
must be produced in a very particular manner linked to distant
governance.49 The idea that freedom is an actively created condition for
life can be related to the work of Mark Duffield, who has offered one of
the most comprehensive critiques on [liberal
interventionism]{.underline} over a number of years. Duffield has
demonstrated and analyzed the merging of security, development and
humanitarian discourses, all of which [are **increasingly underpinned**
by the]{.underline} same [logic of]{.underline} '**[governance at a
distance]{.underline}**' [enabled by **network
technologies**]{.underline}. In particular, security and humanitarianism
has taken an explicitly neoliberal turn as [disaster affected
populations are now expected to **self-manage**]{.underline}. Duffield
explains that the merging of security and humanitarianism within a
neoliberal framework has led to the notion of 'resilience,' which
"focuses on narcissistic and subjective forms of care-of-the-self."50
Duffield argues that [**remote technologies** for surveillance and
bio-political management are **part** of the]{.underline} neoliberal
[shift]{.underline} in political economy more widely.51 Within this
paradigm shift, [affected populations are to be]{.underline} "**[made
free]{.underline}**" and to "embrace risk and thereby develop foresight
and enterprise."52 Again, [the idea of being]{.underline} '[made
free]{.underline}' [emphasizes the liberal interventionist role of
**producing freedom**]{.underline}, but [not in terms of **emancipatory
conditions**]{.underline} [circumscribed by a **positive commitment** to
liberty]{.underline} in the philosophical sense, [but]{.underline}
rather [through a **contradictory** and **explicitly negative form** of
liberty]{.underline} within an absence of formal constraints. [A
positive form of liberty would imply the need for various forms of
**material** and **resource commitment**]{.underline} (money, time,
people, expertise, etc.), [whereas negative liberty simply
assumes]{.underline} an ideological and structural commitment to
**[removing]{.underline}** obvious obstacles or
**[barriers]{.underline}** to expressing one's freedom. People are made
free via the removal of institutional, cultural and other social
restrictions (including social protections), thus enabling their own
volition.53 For Duffield, "resilience embodies a new biopolitics that
differs from the actuarial and protective biopolitics \[\...\] that
underpins the great modernist project of Welfare Fordism."54

[This distancing]{.underline} of humanitarianism, development and
security **[should not obscure the violence perpetuated in their
name]{.underline}**. [Just as security begins to appear as
an]{.underline} '**[everywhere]{.underline}**' [and]{.underline}
'**[permanent]{.underline}**' [war]{.underline}, [populations are
**abandoned** to a state of]{.underline} "**[permanent
emergency]{.underline}**."55 [These]{.underline} populations [are the
same groups that are made the objects of securing against]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} "[liberalism proceeds on the basis that]{.underline}
'**[Others]{.underline}**' [are the **problem to be
solved**]{.underline}."56 The **[remote management]{.underline}** of
populations through techniques of biopolitical governance [is
accomplished with the underlying rationality of **risk
aversion**]{.underline}, [which is]{.underline} argued to be
[**intensified** by the **repeated difficulties** encountered by allied
Western forces in recent campaigns]{.underline}. [There is an **explicit
relationship** between the **failures** of these campaigns and the
growth of **remoteness** as an **ordering logic** for state
intervention]{.underline}, leading Duffield to argue that ground or
"terrestrial" forms of "liberal interventionism now \[lie\] burie\[d\]
in the ruins of Iraq, Libya and Syria."57

The point of government in a neoliberal perspective is neither to limit
the freedom of initiative, nor to assume that social stability depends
on an invisible hand, but rather to carry on a detailed regulation of
liberties for the sake of the 'spontaneous' equilibrium of the markets.
An [incessant work of **data extraction** through ever perfected
algorithms sets the conditions of possibility of the subjects' behaviour
-- economic actors, ideally selfemployees -- and orients it towards the
**preservation** of the **system's dynamic stability**.]{.underline}
[**Social change** is thus **governed** and **reduced** to the
**hyper-modern idea of progress**, conceived as a **variation** within
the parameters deemed necessary for the reproduction and survival of the
system]{.underline}. All the 'irrational' noise that is not immediately
reducible to progress thus conceived is either silenced or -- once
neutralised -- included in the pattern as a risky and unforeseen
opportunity to perfect the system's survival (Castel, 1991; Dean, 1998;
Ewald, 1991). [More radically, these elements are normatively integrated
in the system's core dynamics in the form of an **ethics of
flexibility** (Fraser, 2003) establishing the '**good' functioning of
governmentality.**]{.underline}

[The **government of progress** is thus resolved in the **incessant
operation of protection, management** and promotion of homeostatic
mechanisms deemed capable of self-regulation, but in fact selected and
-- if necessary -- substituted with others, offering a more
**inclusive** and complex **capacity** of **adaptation** to the
macro-mechanism of the market.]{.underline} This macromechanism is the
undisputed horizon that imposes to political power the task of providing
a homeostatic equilibrium functional to its progressive implementation.
With its 'soft' determinism and immanent teleology the market thus
appears to be a hypermodern version of the clockwork universe theorised
in early-modern mechanical science, and the vector of a similar
onto-epistemological reduction of social reality to a mathematical form.
[And this **reduction** still relies on a '**mythical' concept of
progress** alimenting an 'illusion of simultaneity' that hides a
plurality of paths by projecting the '**eternal present'** of the market
on all possible futures.]{.underline}

Simondon: **[Progress and metastability]{.underline}**

[The **connection** we have established between **cybernetics** and
**neoliberalism**]{.underline} will allow us to use Simondon's [concept
of 'metastability']{.underline} against both of them. Although
acknowledging Wiener's invention of the term (Simondon, 2014, p. 236),
Simondon elaborated the [concept of **metastability**]{.underline}
drawing on Canguilhem's work and [in explicit contrast to the cybernetic
concept of homeostasis]{.underline}. Metastability describes [systems
macroscopically stable]{.underline} but [internally characterised by an
uneven distribution of potentials and hosting processes that make that
stability only apparent]{.underline}. Metastable systems enjoy a
'stability far from equilibrium' in which the aleatory 'encounter' with
a minimal quantity of energy or information can trigger a brusque
alteration of equilibrium, and lead to the invention of new structures
and hence to a new 'metastable state'. The [notion of **metastable
equilibrium** marks the project of an 'axiomatic of human
sciences']{.underline} Simondon presents [**in explicit opposition** to
the **cybernetic theory of society,**]{.underline}
[questioning]{.underline} at the same time [the notion of homeostasis
and the **deterministic ontology**]{.underline} the latter relies upon
(Simondon, 1958/2020, pp. 697ff.). Briefly sketching Simondon's project
will allow us to outline the [theory of government]{.underline} he
elaborates in contrast to Wiener's, and [explain how this may be used as
an **antidote** to the **neoliberal conception of government** and the
hyper-modern condition it shares with **cybernetics**]{.underline}.
Simondon's [concept of 'metastability]{.underline}', we will argue, [can
support an **alternative understanding of progress** based on the idea
of government as the facilitation of normative invention]{.underline}.

In his social theory, [Simondon expands on Canguilhem's study of social
normativity]{.underline}. Canguilhem's starting point is a [critical
reading of the biological modelling of society]{.underline} adopted
within the French sociological tradition. In that paradigm the
sociologist is asked to [define the 'normal type' and provide the
politician, the social physician, with the task of re-establishing the
'normal state', independently of the way society 'appears to
itself']{.underline} (Durkheim, 1924, p. 54). Canguilhem provides a
decisive critique to the organic model and a radical turn to its
political implications. What he considers socially 'pathological' is not
the deviation from normality, but, on the contrary, [the very
normalisation of a 'stable' form of equilibrium]{.underline}. Relying on
the work of the German neurologist and thinker Kurt Goldstein, he
assumes that, both organically and socially, 'the healthy state, much
more than the normal state . . . is the state which allows transition to
new norms', while 'pathological constants' are 'repulsive and strictly
conservative' (Canguilhem, 1991, p. 228) and in fact typical of a form
of life stuck in its own 'narrowed milieu' and incapable of further
normative invention (Goldstein, 1995, p. 188). [Simondon welcomes
Canguilhem's advice to consider society in its own terms, as 'neither
machine nor life]{.underline}' (Canguilhem, 2002), [and takes it a step
further, also **attacking** the **technological modelling** of society
theorised by **cybernetics**.]{.underline}

Simondon detects in [Wiener's cybernetic theory of society an attempt to
**reduce the complexity** of social systems to the technological model
of the 'automaton']{.underline}. For Simondon [automata are emblematic
of the **hyper-modern condition**]{.underline} -- [they represent a
rigidly **deterministic** understanding of change]{.underline} that de
facto cancels it: 'the automaton is entirely given in its initial state,
it functions but does not become' (Simondon, 2016, p. 401). '[**Direct
adaptation'** and '**structural stability'** are the hallmarks of 'the
**perfect automaton'**,]{.underline} and [ultimately rely on the same
normative assumptions implicit in the concept of
'homeostasis']{.underline} that Wiener's technological model implicitly
sets as the ultimate goal of social organisation. Simondon reverses this
value judgement while questioning the epistemic value of the model
itself. The very study of technical objects shows that 'automatism'
describes 'a rather low degree of technical perfection' and its idea is
in fact a myth rooted in 'economic or social' thinking rather than in
technical knowledge (Simondon, 1958/2017, p. 17). In social theory, the
ideas of automatism and homeostasis, although describing a crucial
aspect of social dynamics -- that is the closure within 'a
stereotypical, hypertelic and inevolutive adaptation' -- fail to grasp
the 'constructive and creative adaptation' of societies. While for
Wiener homeostatic stabilisation defines both the core functioning and
the goal of social systems, for Simondon a degree of social homeostasis
is both a prerequisite of society -- the 'rate of automatism' that
grants 'stability and cohesion' -- and a problem (Simondon, 1958/2020,
pp. 422--423).

Wiener's [hyper-modern renewal of the Hobbesian myth of a political
'automaton' is]{.underline}, from Simondon's perspective, [an
**epistemological mistake** and a political danger]{.underline}.
Statistical mechanics hinders a proper understanding of processes
harbouring a 'margin of indeterminacy' (Simondon, 1958/2017, pp.
147--159) that can only be understood through a 'non-probabilistic
method' (Simondon, 1958/2020, p. 697), and the myth of the automaton
surreptitiously becomes a goal whose actual realisation would destroy
the very system it was supposed to save. [A perfect 'automatic'
homeostasis, far from solving the problem of social regulation would
substitute the social system's 'tense' metastability with the kind of
dynamic stability that ultimately leads the system to
exhaustion]{.underline}. [The **self-destructive goal** of automatism is
in fact the cancellation of any 'margin of indeterminacy' with the
result that 'there is no longer any possible variation; the functioning
repeats indefinitely']{.underline} (Simondon, 1958/2017, p. 152) until
entropy consumes all the residual potentials, leading to the 'resolution
of all tensions', that is 'death'. For Simondon, on the contrary, a
[system only keeps **working** and **developing** as long as it
'**conserves the tensions** in the **equilibrium of metastability**
instead of nullifying them in the equilibrium of stability']{.underline}
(Simondon, 1958/2020, p. 226).

It is on this basis that Simondon sketches his **[theory of government
as an alternative]{.underline}** to Wiener's. Playing a biological model
against Wiener's normative assumption that 'a good homeostatic
regulation is the ultimate purpose of societies, the ideal that must
animate every act of government' (Simondon, 1958/2017, p. 162) Simondon
theorises government as an act of normative invention relying on
existing social automatisms but exceeding them. An 'act of government'
for Simondon should be 'grounded in homeostases so as to develop itself
and to continue its coming-into-being, rather than remaining perpetually
in the same state' (p. 162). Governing is 'inventing' solutions aimed at
making the system 'metastable', that is open to further invention,
rather than contributing to reproduce the ideal order imagined by social
theory and imposed by politics as a goal.

Many [critics of neoliberal governmentality, and in particular of its
'algorithmic' version,]{.underline} have been inspired by Simondon.
[This is evident in their stressing the importance of creating spaces of
political conflict in which **social invention** -- the
'**transindividual** . . . coupling between the inventive and
organisational capacities of several subjects']{.underline} (Simondon,
1958/2017, p. 258) -- [can take place against the dominant neoliberal
neutralisation of subjectivity and conflict]{.underline} (Rouvroy &
Berns, 2013; Stiegler, 2016). **[The idea of 'progress']{.underline}**
may [appear to be embedded in precisely the stance these theorists are
criticising]{.underline}, but we believe that [Simondon's concept of
metastability allows for a different idea of progress]{.underline}. [In
neoliberalism, the market's 'spontaneous' continuation is paradoxically
assumed as the goal of politics, which entails the reduction of progress
to a sequence of preventive social adaptations to ever-emerging 'local'
risks within the naturalised framework of the market. Thus, the
neoliberal promotion of **risk-management ethics**]{.underline} -- [a
lifestyle informed by constant planning, resource management,
etc]{.underline}. -- [is **one of the most powerful ideological tools**
for the **preservation of social homeostasis** within the market
economy.]{.underline} [This government of behaviour is capable of
**de-activating the potential reinvention** of social forms.
'Governmentality' thus conceived is not simply a matter of **preventing
the risk** of a radically disruptive event, it is about **governing its
possibility as such**]{.underline}. The '[**progressive' mechanisms** of
social reproduction governed by the market's open dynamics thus entirely
absorbs what is a completely different kind of 'risk' represented by
**human inventiveness and imagination**,]{.underline} which Simondon
theorises **[under the label of metastability]{.underline}**.

The 'risky' politics of metastability theorised by Simondon is based on
the assumption that progress conceived as the 'invention of new goals'
makes radical novelty possible. [This concept of progress is based on an
understanding of social systems as inherently metastable because of the
'fairly dangerous' automatism characterising the human being, who
'always risks inventing and equipping new structures']{.underline}
(Simondon, 1958/2020, p. 423). This is not to say that Simondon resorts
to a vitalist view on the exceptionality of life over matter or some
sort of social evolutionism. Rather, he theorises 'invention' as an
emergent property of the bio-technical nature of human beings and
societies. This tendency towards invention is for Simondon embedded in
the partial indeterminacy or 'historicity' that, in his ontology,
defines all systems and processes (Bardin, 2021, pp. 36--37). At the
level of human natural and social (i.e. 'transindividual')
'historicity', technical activity is not a mere vector of technological
progress, it is an actual challenge to existing social norms. [Human
'**progress'** takes place at the scale of the '**metastable' system**
formed by 'human beings and the world' and mediated by technical objects
whose functioning exceeds all efforts of symbolisation]{.underline}
(Simondon, 1958/2017, p. 168). Progress thus conceived is not a
triumphal march, it is the result of a disharmonious relationship
between biological patterns that vary in the very long term of natural
history, the [quick accumulation of technoscientific
innovations]{.underline}, and the social rhythm of culture that attempts
to render these processes compatible with its institutional present
(Simondon, 2010). This is neither '[progress conceived as a march in a
direction fixed in advance', nor a process of 'humanisation of nature',
but rather an aleatory process of '**naturalisation of humans'**
mediated by the 't**echno-geographical milieu**' they keep
inventing]{.underline} (Simondon, 1958/2017, p. 58).

[This notion of progress entails a political risk because it leaves
political practice without a safety net. In this open dynamic, the
emergence of finality and hence of social invention is grounded on the
structural lack of control of technical reality that nurtures the very
possibility of human freedom]{.underline}: 'Man \[sic\] frees himself
from his situation of being enslaved by the finality of the whole, by
learning how to create finality . . . as not to have to be passively
subjected to a de facto integration' (Simondon, 1958/2017, p. 119).
[This is what]{.underline}, according to Simondon, [**cybernetics itself
teaches us**, but **crucially missing the point** that r**isk cannot be
recaptured** within the **existing social norms** and **mode of
production**.]{.underline} On the contrary, [**risk conceived** as a
**structural margin of indeterminacy** ('historicity') is embedded in
technical activity, and a constant challenge to the whole 'system of
values']{.underline} (Simondon, 1958/2020, pp. 414--415). We believe
Simondon's [**concept of metastability** opens in this sense to the
possibility of moving beyond the paradoxical conflation of
**determinism** and teleology theorised within the **hyper-modern idea
of progress**, ultimately shared by **cybernetics and neoliberalism**,
and allows to 'think together nature and excess, technology and
revolution']{.underline} (Toscano, 2012, pp. 107--108). It thus [calls
for an **alternative theory** of government]{.underline}.

[Governing progress,]{.underline} in Simondon's sense, [is part of the
collective effort of inventing mediations and solutions in which science
and politics can play a crucial role if they do not reduce the reality
of non-symbolic processes to their -- also scientific --
imagination]{.underline}. This kind of government will have more to do
with the '[invention' of new technical and cultural possibilities than
with the dreamed regulation of the existent]{.underline} by a
philosopherking (Simondon, 1958/2017, pp. 161--163). Such inventions
run, of course, the risk of failure, but this is precisely where their
political value lies. Simondon's concept of progress does not allow acts
of government a safety net offered by social theory predictions. On the
contrary, Simondon's social theory certifies that not running the risk
of normative invention is equal to suffering a different kind of defeat,
the defeat of accepting an allegedly 'progressive' politics that, as a
matter of fact, reaffirms the norms codified by the theory and resists
radical change. This is precisely how Wiener sees p[rogress grounded on
the idea of the **dynamic stability**]{.underline} (homeostasis) of
'local and temporary islands of decreasing entropy', [which 'enables
some of us to assert the **existence of progress'**]{.underline}
(Wiener, 1954/1988, p. 36). Instead, Simondon's vision is condensed in
an ethical formula that critically mirrors Wiener's statement by
reversing it, and postulates that 'there are no lost islands in
becoming, no domains eternally closed in themselves' and 'each gesture'
is an act of invention within a (metastable) network that connects past
and future (Simondon, 1958/2020, p. 377). This [ethical gesture is
inherently political, it requires the active consideration of entropy
and death as part of a system's functioning, and the **assumption of
social invention** as the core of an **idea of progress** to be
formulated beyond the hyper-modern condition]{.underline}.

Conclusion: **[Governing progress]{.underline}**

If one assumes the exhaustion of the (hyper-)modern idea of progress,
one is also deprived of the theoretical background that has long
informed the mechanical understanding of social dynamics, an
understanding that still informs neoliberal governmentality. [A critique
of the concept of homeostasis that grounds this idea of progress, we
have claimed, allows for a different approach.]{.underline} In this
sense, our article firstly offers a historical contribution by exposing
the [onto-epistemological stance that underpins much theorisation of
early modern science and **cybernetics**, liberalism and
neoliberalism]{.underline}. Secondly, it aims to show that Simondon's
[concept of **metastability** opens the path for a **reformulation of
the idea of progress** within a framework that sees partial
indeterminacy]{.underline} (or 'historicity') [at the core of social
dynamics and their government]{.underline}. From this perspective,
knowing the social and acting politically means [favouring the

### Alt Fails---AI

#### Governance is [necessary]{.underline}, rejecting engagement with AI regulation [fails]{.underline}.

**Gulson et. al. 22** - Doctor of Philosophy, Professor at University of
Sydney, current research investigates whether new knowledge, methods and
technologies from life and computing sciences, with a specific focus on
Artificial Intelligence, will substantively alter education policy and
governance. "Algorithms of Education: How Datafication and Artificial
Intelligence Shape Policy." 3lib. May 2022.
<https://3lib.net/book/21413757/7421ff>, AG

[Toward Problematization]{.underline}

The three options above may each offer viable responses to the new
challenges created by synthetic governance depending on the context.
Moreover, each would be comfortably familiar to those in the field of
critical policy studies. Certainly, [there is need for a more **robust
discussion** about regulation, data privacy, and the monetization of
data generated in **education**]{.underline}. However, each of the above
positions depends on an assumed distinction between human and machine
that we have sought to trouble, [locating **political agency** in a
human subject who promotes, enhances, tames, regulates, hides from, or
even destroys machines]{.underline}. Yet [**synthetic governance** as we
have characterized]{.underline} it [is built upon a network
infrastructure that is "medium of contemporary power, and yet no single
subject or group absolutely controls a network.]{.underline}"31

[Between the **abstraction of data**, the materiality of information
systems, the emergence of new forms of thinking, and changes in the
visceral terrain of political life, we can identify **new governing
relations** where humans are in the loop]{.underline}, but not as
independent arbiters of algorithmic decision-making. Even more
strikingly, [**machine cognition** is a **product of human thinking**
that feeds back into human culture]{.underline}, and [we must consider
the view that governance has never been anything other than a
**cybernetic feedback loop**. Resisting the deleterious impacts of
automation will not be a matter of simply regulating or resisting the
use of AI.]{.underline} **[Rejecting AI is untenable]{.underline}**;
this is not going to stop its development and use, nor does such a
position reckon with the [genealogy of the present moment and the long
history of statistical reasoning in education governance]{.underline}
that has brought us to our current position.

[While this may seem somewhat fatalistic, we believe that we can
**develop a politics** that is **not premised on a dichotomous view of
human and machine** and that works with the uncertainty that is the
departure point and destination of **new data-driven
technologies**.]{.underline} While the [instrumental, **market
rationalities underpinning education** today will likely be **reinforced
by machines**]{.underline}, it [may also be possible that new
rationalities and techniques might create other ways of thinking about
the problems of education **governance**]{.underline}, [disrupting
long-standing problems and **solutions in education**]{.underline}.

[We need a **politics that is critical but not
antitechnology**]{.underline}, [a **politics** that does not formulate
the problem poorly by opposing human values, agency, and interest on the
one hand, and technology on the other]{.underline}. [We argue that a
politics adequate to **synthetic governance** would not **juxtapose
human agency and technological determinism**;]{.underline}
rather[,]{.underline} we would need to consider how to more consciously
navigate this reconstitution. It will not always be possible to break
open the black box of AI and digital platforms, because this assumes a
particular form of separation between human and machine that is no
longer tenable. Rather, we might ask: [What kinds of worlds are being
created by algorithms, and how will we respond to the types of new
truths that are being created? What are the limits of rectification, of
appeal and regulation]{.underline}? This [perspective **challenges**
some of the **primary approaches to automation**, and the technical and
political solutions to issues of bias and black-boxing, that reflect a
desire for a **human in the loop** as a corrective or
safeguard.]{.underline}

[We thus need to **rethink political agency in synthetic
governance**.]{.underline} The epigraph from Edwards that opens this
chapter suggests [it is entirely likely that we have willingly been
assimilated into new relations with technologies and that this process
cannot be reversed]{.underline}. We could go further by suggesting that
the assimilation Edwards describes would not have been particularly
susceptible to our willing otherwise. [This does not mean that politics
is impossible, but perhaps not a politics of the deliberative variety.
We think it vitally important that we develop a **critical synthetic
politics** that **responds not to fears that technology will get away
from us** (the singularity) so much as the politics of networks that
become so diffuse as to resist meaningful intervention.]{.underline}

[A synthetic politics begins from the premise that there is no outside
of algorithmic decision-making and automated thinking.]{.underline} [We
must think with and through our imbrications with other modes of
cognition as a kind of **"co-learning" with automated
systems**]{.underline}.32 A particular rationality is needed--- to be
[open to the co-adaptation of humans and machines by recognizing that
machine learning is the latest iteration in a longer history of thought
that has never been limited to the human.]{.underline} [E**ducation is a
site where we can embrace synthetic thought** with a **carefully
articulated view of the risks**, rather than reacting against it or
embracing it uncritically. Education is a site in which we can remain
open to the uncertainties, risks, and possibilities of synthetic
governance.]{.underline}

### Alt Fails---Crackdown

#### Extreme post-pandemic politics incites resistance that coopts the alt.

**Bratton 21** -- Benjamin Bratton's work spans Philosophy,
Architecture, Computer Science and Geopolitics, He is Professor of
Visual Arts at University of California, San Diego, Program Director of
The Terraforming program at the Strelka Institute, and author of several
books including "The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty." "The Revenge
of the Real - Politics for a Post-Pandemic World." June 2021. AG

The rapid but awkward appearance of face masks in the West entails an
even more radical confrontation with the limits of the subjective per se
. [It makes clear that regardless of one's subjective ethical intention,
good or bad, one remains a contagion vector just the same]{.underline}.
As said, it doesn't matter if one wishes to do good or harm, one's
biological proximity to others will cause good or harm regardless.
[Subjective intent is irrelevant.]{.underline}

[A source of confusion for many is a shift in ethics from a position
that calibrates subjective moral will to one that recognizes one's self
and body as an object in a cause-and-effect relationship with the
world.]{.underline} It is often presumed that **[agency and
subjectivity]{.underline}** (if not also identity) [are interchangeable,
but the consequentialist ethics of being an object]{.underline} (less a
subject) [works differently]{.underline}. Outcomes are not a mirror of
an internal mental state. They are not directly dependent on public
demonstration, performance, and ritual to effect physical change. [The
**implications** for other **biopolitical and ecopolitical conditions**,
such as combating climate change, are decisive.]{.underline}

The main misapprehension so common in the mask war---[that **risk can be
privatized**]{.underline}---[is not unexpected if considered in the
context of how social ethics is already predicated on moral
subjectivity]{.underline}. As opposed to the epidemiological conception
of society, [this practice sees ethics as the individual calculus of
risk, reward, and consequences]{.underline}. The naked-faced do not mean
harm, one assumes, and may even imagine themselves as bearing the burden
of risk for everyone. This [confusion between **subjective and objective
ethics** cuts both ways, in that someone with a positive moral
subjective disposition may imagine that the absence of harm they bring
by wearing a mask is somehow due to their personal intention of
goodness]{.underline}. It is not. To be contagious is not to be a bad
person, but it does mean that, irrespective of one's wishes, one may
cause objective harm to others. The harm that one person may bring to
another person has nothing to do with the affective bond or antagonism
they feel.

[The **revenge of the real** arises in the ethical challenges posed by
the realization that the virus is indifferent to the moral projections
we might make upon it]{.underline}. [A viable **post-pandemic politics**
cannot be predicated solely on the **calibration of subjective
intention** because subjective intention is not the only cause of the
effects we wish to realize or prevent.]{.underline} This is a
[**challenge to political philosophy** as well]{.underline}, in that it
demands [the **conceptualization of an ethics of being an object** , not
of being a subject,]{.underline} which is, obviously, difficult for
everyone and insulting for many. [That is in no small part because of
how many people have been long subordinated into positions by which
their social identity is erased or diluted by being made into a human
object.]{.underline}

And yet, **[the private vocality of subjective determinism cannot
hold]{.underline}**. [The **extreme subjectivism** that asks you to "be
the change you wish to see in the world," as if internal mental states
cause the external world to come into being, **is not the solution to
neoliberalism; it is its pinnacle**.]{.underline}

[This shift to the objective has everything to do with the
**biopolitics** of medical care and the **relation between immediacy and
abstraction**]{.underline}. [The body as a medical object is a real
thing, flesh and blood and tears]{.underline}. Each of us, at different
times, lives in a body as a medical object. [When needed we assume this
objectivity and receive care accordingly.]{.underline} When someone's
temperature is taken or they are intubated, or their internal organs are
monitored by the puncturing of the skin and the externalization of their
blood, which is then analyzed for telltale traces, the care is not based
entirely on the testimony of symptoms of this one body, but rather on
this particular body as exemplary of a larger abstraction of medical
knowledge about all the bodies that exhibit a similar pattern of
symptoms, and all the bodies through which the virus has passed. That
[abstraction, the transference between the particular patient and the
generic human, is the stuff of both high-tech and high-touch
expertise.]{.underline}

[This also underscores the role of modeling abstraction in positive
biopolitics more generally]{.underline}. The capacity to provide care to
the singular body in front of you requires the moment in which it
becomes any body , to which a model medical abstraction, based on years
of pattern recognition, must be applied as care. This is an
epistemological relation, not just an affective one. Through the medical
professional, it is a model sensing and acting back upon the world
recursively through careful expertise that would be impossible by sheer
reckoning. The doctor may care deeply for their patient on an
interpersonal level, but more likely they are able to care for them
because they are able to see them as an object.

[Taken seriously, the implications are profound]{.underline}. [One's
sense of bioethics would extend then not only to the protection of
personal privacy and the prevention of the violence of being treated
like a mere object, but also to the deliberate and **ethical
self-objectification** as a responsible participant in the model
abstractions through which the care of others is realized.]{.underline}
[An overemphasis in bioethics on the sanctity of the sovereign
individual]{.underline}, and the [protection against over-intervention,
over-sensing, and over-objectification]{.underline}, **[may obscure the
ethical problems of under-intervention]{.underline}**, under-sensing,
and lack of access to medical care based on exclusive models of the
whole and, consequently, limited access to intervention. Those in
socio-economic positions that prevent them from receiving the medical
care they need may be less concerned about the psychological insult of
being treated like an object by medical abstraction than they are about
the real personal danger of not being treated at all. [For this reason,
among many others, the broken sensor layer and the **inability to cohere
inclusive and equitable biopolitics** is itself a form of **collective
violence**]{.underline}.

[When model abstractions built over years of expert care and
collaborative honing become a matter of life and death, a more nuanced
approach comes into focus]{.underline}, regarding both what is and isn't
invasive "surveillance," and how a society should undertake sensing and
modeling so that it can compose itself deliberately. [The same can be
said for climate models, which will demand a similar **reckoning** with
a **social "ethics"** that is **not based on coaxing enough subjective
moral gestures** to change planetary geochemistry but on **more direct
interventions** in a composite condition.]{.underline}

To be sure, the ways that [this post-pandemic politics **complicates
deep cultures** of individualism, subjectivism, and experientialism now
at the center of conception of the common good, will **invite vociferous
reaction and resistance**]{.underline}. These [**habits** and
**impulses** reside at the **core of Western social thought**, so why
would they be anything but **stubborn**]{.underline}? On[e assumes as
well that this **resistance** will come not only from the obvious
**political right-wing cultures**]{.underline} that have hitched
themselves to sovereign power over biopower until the literal end of the
world, [but also]{.underline}, I am sorry to say, [from **philosophers**
to whom people have looked for guidance as to what the interrelations
between biology, politics, and the body have been and should
be.]{.underline}

Behold the fear in this voice, already introduced above: "[At stake here
is nothing other than the **new and 'normal' biopolitical relation**
**between citizens and the State**]{.underline}. [This relation **no
longer has to do with free and active participation** in the public
sphere, but instead **concerns the routine inscription** and
registration **of** the most private and most incommunicable element of
**subjectivity**, **the biopolitical life of the body "**]{.underline}
(emphasis mine). So wrote Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben. Once
more, the "biopolitical life of the body" is not incommunicable, nor the
basis of a private subjectivity, as should be obvious to anyone with a
rudimentary interest in modern biological knowledge, let alone
epidemiology.

Perhaps we should have seen it coming, but what happened next was one of
the most cataclysmic and grotesque self-owns in the history of
philosophy.

### Impact Defense

#### Framing issue\-\--we are physchologically predisposed against emerging tech.

Mason University. "Permissionless Innovation: The Continuing Case for
Comprehensive Technological Freedom." Semantic Scholar. Mar 14.

AG

C: WHY DOES DOOMSAYING DOMINATE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES?

One of the reasons that precautionary thinking often creeps into
technology policy discussions is that, as already noted, [our collective
first reaction to new technologies often is one of dystopian dread. We
assume the worst for a variety of reasons]{.underline}.25 In the
extreme, [the initial resistance to new technologies
sometimes]{.underline} [takes the form of a full-blown technopanic,
which refers to "intense public, political, and academic responses to
the emergence or use of media or technologies, especially by the
young]{.underline}."26 Some new technologies were initially resisted and
even regulated because they disrupted long-standing social norms,
traditions, and institutions.

[What drives this fear and the resulting panics?]{.underline}

[There are many explanations for why we see and hear so much fear and
loathing in information technology **policy debates today,** and even
some occasional technopanics]{.underline}.[27There exist many general
**psychological explanations** for why human beings are **predisposed
toward pessimism** and are risk-averse to new technologies and
technological developments.]{.underline}28 For a variety of reasons,
[humans are poor judges of risks to themselves or those close to
them.]{.underline} Harvard University psychology professor Steven
Pinker, author of The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature,
notes:

> The mind is more comfortable in reckoning probabilities in terms of
> the relative frequency of remembered or imagined events. That can make
> recent and memorable events---a plane crash, a shark attack, an
> anthrax infection---loom larger in one's worry list than more frequent
> and boring events, such as the car crashes and ladder falls that get
> printed beneath the fold on page B14. And it can lead risk experts to
> speak one language and ordinary people to hear another.

29 [Clive Thompson, a contributor to Wired and the New York Times
Magazine, also notes that "**dystopian predictions are easy to
generate**" and "**doomsaying is emotionally
self-protective**:]{.underline} [if you complain that today's technology
is wrecking the culture, you can tell yourself you're a gimlet-eyed
critic who isn't hoodwinked by high-tech trends and silly, popular
activities like social networking.]{.underline} You seem like someone
who has a richer deeper appreciation for the past and who stands above
the triviality of today's life."

30 [Beyond these **root-cause explanations**, there are many other
specific factors that contribute to the rise of technopanics and lead us
to fear new technological developments]{.underline}. Importantly,
however, each of these particular explanations builds on previous
insight: [**Survival instincts** combined with **poor comparative
risk-analysis skills** lead many people to engage in, or buy into,
technopanics.]{.underline}

• [Generational differences]{.underline}: Generational differences
[often motivate pessimistic attitudes about the impact of technology on
culture and society.]{.underline} Parents and policymakers who dread the
changes to cultural or privacy-related norms ushered in by new
technologies often forget they, too, were children once and heard
similar complaints from their elders about the gadgets and content of
their generation. Yet [these cycles of "juvenoia"---or "exaggerated
anxiety about the influence of social change on children and
youth"---repeat endlessly and drive panics from one generation to the
next.31]{.underline}

• [Hypernostalgia]{.underline}: As already noted, [many stasis-minded
critics just can't seem to let go of the past]{.underline}. They are too
invested in it or wedded to something about it. [They engage in forms of
hypernostalgia and ask us to imagine there existed some earlier time
that was more exceptional and valuable than the unfolding present or
unpredictable future.]{.underline}32 [Such critics are guilty of both
"**rosy retrospection bias**]{.underline}," or "the tendency to remember
past events as being more positive than they actually were,"33 [and a
general "**pessimistic bias**," or "a tendency to **overestimate** the
**severity** of economic problems and underestimate the (recent) past,
present, and future performance of the economy]{.underline}."34 [These
critics fear how technological change challenges the old order,
traditional values, settled norms, traditional business models, and
existing institutions]{.underline}---even as the standard of living
generally improves with each passing generation. [We see this at
work,]{.underline} for example, in debates about privacy when critics
yearn for the supposed solitude of the past, or in copyright debates
when critics bemoan the loss of record stores and traditional methods of
experiencing music.

• [Bad news sells:]{.underline} Many media outlets and sensationalist
authors sometimes use fear-based tactics to gain influence or sell
books. [**Fearmongering** and prophecies of doom are always
**effective** media **tactics**; alarmism helps media outlets break
through all the noise and get heard]{.underline}. This is particularly
true as it relates to kids and online safety, where hypothetical threats
to children have often dominated media coverage.

• [The role of **special interests**]{.underline}: [Many groups and
institutions exaggerate fears and agitate for action because they
benefit from it either directly by getting more resources from
government, the public, or other benefactors, or indirectly from the
glow of publicity that their alarmism generates]{.underline}. Many
companies also overhype various online concerns and then also overplay
the benefits of their particular tool as a silver-bullet solution to
online pornography, privacy, or cybersecurity concerns. [Again, bad news
sells---and, in this case, it sells products and services to fearful
citizens.]{.underline}

• **[Elitist attitudes]{.underline}**: [Academic skeptics and cultural
critics often possess elitist attitudes about the technologies,
platforms, or new types of media content]{.underline} that the masses or
youth adopt before they do. [These elitist views are often premised on
the juvenoia and hypernostalgic thinking described above. Some
researchers also have an **incentive to perpetuate fear** because
alarmist research grabs attention and attracts more
funding.]{.underline}

• "Third-person-effect hypothesis": When some people encounter
perspectives or preferences at odds with their own, they are more likely
to be concerned about the impact of those things on others throughout
society and to call on government to "do something" to correct or
counter those perspectives or preferences. Psychologists refer to this
as the "third-person effect hypothesis," and it explains many
technopanics and resulting calls for government intervention, especially
as they relate to media policy and free speech issues.35

Most technopanics blow over in time, but they can do real harm in the
short term. [Technopanics can encourage policymakers to adopt
far-reaching controls on information flows and innovation opportunities
more generally.]{.underline}

Worse yet, [continuously elevated states of fear or panic can lead to
**dangerous tensions** throughout society.]{.underline} For example, the
past decade witnessed a "stranger danger" panic about hypothetical
online bogeymen, leading to overblown suspicions about sexual predators
online and even the general presence of males near children.46
Similarly, excessive panic over cybersecurity matters can lead to
paranoia about the potential danger of visiting certain websites or
using certain digital tools that are, generally speaking, safe and
beneficial to the masses.47

[The final reason that these fear tactics are dangerous is that they
lead to a "risk mismatch." That is, fear-based tactics and **inflated
threat scenarios** can lead to situations where individuals and society
ignore quite serious risks because they are overshadowed by unnecessary
panics over nonproblems.]{.underline}

### Tech Good---AI

#### AI key to save millions each year -- medical tech.

**Bornet '21** Bornet is Chief Data Officer at Aera Technology and a
board member at the Intelligent Automation Council. He is a contributor
and senior advisor at The Institute for Robotic Process Automation &
Artificial Intelligence (IRPA AI). (Pascal Bornet, \"Council Post:
Saving Millions Of Lives Per Year With Intelligent Automation\", Forbes,
5-13-2021,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/05/13/saving-millions-of-lives-per-year-with-intelligent-automation/?sh=352cbe4d1349.
Accessed 7-4-2022, RS).

[Intelligent Automation (IA)]{.underline} is more than a way to
revolutionize business and save money --- it also [has the potential to
save lives by the millions and increase healthy life expectancy.
Intelligent automation can be applied to medical diagnosis and research
to prevent unnecessary deaths. In addition, it provides more equitable
access to healthcare worldwide]{.underline}. It also can be used in
transport to augment the abilities of human drivers, preventing deaths
and injuries from traffic accidents.

Preventing Deaths Through Diagnosis And Research

So [many deaths worldwide are caused by chronic non-communicable
diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and
respiratory illnesses.]{.underline}

An important characteristic of these diseases is that [recovery rates
are higher the earlier the disease is detected. Leveraging machine
learning (ML), IA can save lives by analyzing scans and other medical
data such as blood pressure to produce quick and reliable
diagnoses]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, ML can process lung or breast
scans in minutes or seconds where a human would take hours, but what's
more remarkable is that it has advantages over doctors when it comes to
identifying cancer.

Another common factor among these diseases is the potential to find
cures through research. Not only does [ML help innovation in medical
research (e.g., by simulating the combination of molecules), but it also
plays a vital role by automating the documentation and checking of
clinical trials, freeing up human researchers for higher-level cognitive
tasks]{.underline} and making the research process quicker and more
efficient.

Preventing Deaths Caused By Medical Errors

[Medical errors are a sad and often overlooked element of modern
healthcare]{.underline}. In the U.S., they cause over 250,000 deaths per
year, which is higher than any other single factor except heart disease
and cancer.

In 2006, Emily Jerry, a two-year-old recovering from cancer, tragically
died after a pharmacy technician gave her 20 times the recommended
concentration of intravenous saline solution. Emily's father wrote,
"Medical-care workers are dedicated, caring people, but they are human.
And human beings make mistakes."

[IA, in conjunction with human professionals, can double-check
prescriptions and identify discrepancies from doctors' instructions or
medical best practices]{.underline}. It is never tired nor distracted,
so it is not vulnerable to lapses in concentration, which happen to
everyone but can have disastrous consequences in healthcare.

[IA can also monitor patients' health in real-time]{.underline}. It can
alert a nurse or doctor about an emergency based on a patient's blood
pressure, heart rate or other vital signs. It can even detect patterns
that predict heart attacks, strokes or sepsis in advance, saving lives
and freeing up doctors' and nurses' time from data collection.

Reducing Deaths From Preventable Causes In Developing Countries

The [global disparity in wealth and resources means that many people in
the developing world die of diseases that would be easily preventable in
wealthier countries]{.underline}. This is largely due to inadequate
access to healthcare. According to the WHO, there is a global shortage
of 4.3 million healthcare professionals.

[IA technology brings healthcare to anyone with access to a
smartphone]{.underline} --- which is an increasing proportion of people,
even in regions that lack other infrastructure and technology.
Applications can link patients with doctors remotely, while diagnostic
tools can partially take the place of the doctor by diagnosing skin
conditions, burns and chronic wounds based on a digital photo.

[Medical care often requires physical supplies such as vaccines or
donated blood, which cannot be delivered digitally]{.underline}. To
provide these life-saving supplies to remote locations without adequate
road infrastructure, [Zipline International uses innovative, intelligent
drones that can deliver supplies.]{.underline}

Reducing Deaths From Traffic Accidents

Road incidents can be deadly and can cause permanent disabilities. Human
error is a factor in most road accidents, and there is potential for
self-driving cars or IA-assisted driving technology to save lives by
reducing or eliminating this factor[. Research from the U.S. Department
of Transport estimates 94% of traffic accidents are caused by human
error.]{.underline}

Even before fully autonomous self-driving cars become the norm, [IA can
assist human drivers and help them to drive more safely]{.underline}.
Cars can already be augmented with kits that allow them to monitor the
driver using an internal camera, detecting when they become drowsy and
alerting them. Automatic sensors can also be used to augment the human
driver's vision, warning them of unexpected obstacles. Cruise control
and assisted parking are further examples of IA technology working
together with human drivers to help them drive more safely.

Conclusion

Health organizations that want to start embracing the benefits of IA
should start with the most common use cases in their industry: new
patient onboarding and appointment scheduling with the support of
automated workflows and cognitive agents, patient health monitoring
leveraging cameras and sensors in hospital rooms, medical diagnosis and
drug discovery supported by machine learning, staffing level prediction
and real-time adjustment processes, automation of invoicing and claims
management and patient experience improvement through real-time and 24/7
communication. If you start with these smaller, everyday processes then
build forward from there, you will be able to embrace IA in ways that
make your routines and processes easier from the beginning.

Overall, based on my research and expertise, I believe [IA technologies
could reduce early deaths by 10--30%.]{.underline} Back in 2017, [a 20%
reduction in the 56 million total annual deaths worldwide would have
meant saving 14 million lives every year --- the equivalent of the
populations of Switzerland and Singapore.]{.underline}

### Tech Good---Peace

#### Tech creates peace along [multiple vectors]{.underline}.

**Fatima '18** Quratulain Fatima is the Project Lead of the Agency for
Barani Areas Development, with a focus on gender inclusive development
and conflict prevention, and she was the first woman to join the
Pakistan Air Force. She is a 2018 Aspen New Voices Fellow, a BuildPeace
Fellow 2017-18 and Oxford Global Leadership Initiative Fellow 2016.
(Quratulain Fatima, \"Peace technology: A promising tool against wars at
reduced price\", news.trust.org, 3-23-2018,
https://news.trust.org/item/20180323160358-p5wkq/. Accessed 7-4-2022,
RS).

[From apps to help citizens avoid missiles and land mines to rumor
tracking mobile-based services using SMS, peace technology is one
promising tool to prevent conflict]{.underline}

It has been seven years since I left Pakistan\'s Air Force, where I was
part of the war against terrorism. I left hoping our conflicts would end
soon, but nothing has changed. A World Bank-UN study \"Pathways for
Peace\" has found that in 2016 alone, more countries experienced
conflict than at any time in past 30 years. According to the same study,
the economic cost of responding to conflict for 2012 was US \$9.46
trillion which is 2.4 times the total GDP of Africa. [Whereas, targeting
resources toward countries at high risk of conflict each year could
result in average net savings of \$33 billion per year from avoided
conflicts for the international community. But instead of saving more,
we are spending more - and more people are dying.]{.underline}

[With conflict resolution and rebuilding costs increasing at an alarming
rate in prolonged conflicts like Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, many
experts say that the focus of the international community needs to shift
from conflict resolution to conflict prevention]{.underline}. It is high
time that, in addition to existing peace-building tools, we explore new,
effective and cheap tools of conflict prevention.

Today in a second career where I am building water infrastructures for
poor farmers, I find I am able to try to prevent conflicts that I was
responding to in the Air Force. I have experienced that investment in
conflict prevention tools reduce military spending and free tax money
for education, health and other priorities. [One such tool is the use of
information and communication technology for conflict prevention. This
technology is most commonly known by the collective name of peace
technology or \"PeaceTech.\" PeaceTech includes, but is not limited to,
the use of mobile phones, digital applications, geographical information
systems, social media and even digital games for achieving
peace]{.underline}.

Even in relatively poor countries, [technology is already an integral
part of life that does everything from bringing news and entertainment
to saving lives. Everyone tweeting can now become a voice, and thus a
stakeholder, in a conflict]{.underline}. So why not use the technology
as an effective and low-cost peace tool?

In Pakistan, I work on a project where we map geographical features on
the earth surface, called a Geographical Information System (GIS). This
was initially developed to design water dams and ponds in arid areas,
but has been successfully put to use to prevent and resolve communal
water disputes among farming communities at zero cost. Using this tool,
the locations and conflict intensity can be geographically pinpointed on
maps. [These maps are then analyzed to assess what interventions are
needed to stop conflict from breaking out. The GIS system also acts as
an early warning network for conflict and a database of
resolutions.]{.underline}

While still in its early stages, we hope this project will help stop
violence before it starts, helping government officials and
non-governmental organizations to use geo-spatial data to support
existing conflict prevention mechanisms like village elders and
community organizations in the area.

[GIS is only one of the many PeaceTech tools that are making prevention
work around the world. The Una Hakika (which means \"are you sure?\" in
Swahili) project in Kenya is a rumor tracking mobile-based service using
SMS and a web and mobile-based platform (wikirumours) moderating
misinformation and disinformation to track and counter violence-inciting
rumours in Kenya\'s Tana Delta]{.underline}. An impact evaluation for
Una Hakika shows that a number of 300 rumour investigations led to
results benefiting an estimated 45,000 people over a period of a year.

Likewise, [tech fans in Syria are creating apps to help citizens avoid
missiles and land mines. These early warning systems received reports of
ballistic missile launches, made calculations and sent early warnings
through SMS and email to the publics]{.underline} to avoid attacks.
Until now peace builders have been predominantly using traditional tools
of prevention - diplomacy, mediation and consensus-building. [These
approaches have their limits, however, and what is often missing is
outreach to the individuals in communities at risk of a violent
conflict. Peace technology is one promising tool for making these
connections. It can also be effectively used as a data collection tool
to build a strong responsive database for organizations working on
conflict prevention.]{.underline}

3\. Rational capitulationism

[An argument for the anti-progressionist version of transhumanism here
advocated goes as follows:]{.underline}

> Premise 1. [The futurological program of transhumanism would by all
> accounts increase the likelihood of self-annihilation.]{.underline}

By now, the truth of this proposition should be obvious: [the philosophy
of transhumanism asserts both that (i) the advanced technologies of the
GNR revolution will enable us to world-engineer and personengineer in
radically new ways -- possibly even enabling us to construct a novel
species of technologized posthumans to take our place on the
phylogenetic tree]{.underline} -- and (ii) [the "enhancement"
technologies that promise to make the creation of posthumans possible
ought to be pursued,]{.underline} albeit in a circumspect if
"proactionary" manner (More 2005). As expounded in the futurological
argument of Section 2, of all the technology kinds that humans have
devised since the Oldowan industry (circa 2.6 mya), those of the GNR
revolution are by far the riskiest: not only has the number of
existential risks and probability of their actualization increased
significantly in the past 50 years, but this trend may actually be
exponential. [In the worst case scenario, this exponential growth of
existential risks would persist into the next couple centuries, thus
precipitating an ERS. It is therefore by virtue of transhumanism's
imperative that we should foment and catalyze the further development of
GNR technologies]{.underline} that its futurological program will
increase the likelihood of self-annihilation. [Nonetheless, it is
**crucial** to note that]{.underline}...

> Premise 2. [The **alternative** futurological programs proposed would
> almost **certainly increase** the likelihood of self-annihilation more
> than transhumanism would.]{.underline}

There are myriad reasons for accepting this claim. [One line of
argumentation suggests that humanity has (so to speak) **crossed the
Rubicon** of technological development: **there is no turning back
now**, at least not without further exacerbating our existential plight
or significantly increasing human suffering]{.underline}.31 Consider the
option of broadly relinquishing (say) genetic engineering, due to the
profound risks associated with its dual use properties. How might this
be accomplished? As Walker writes in a 2009 article:

> Relinquishment requires us to not only stop future developments but
> also to turn back the hands of time, technologically speaking. If we
> want to keep ourselves completely immune from the potential negative
> effects of genetic engineering we would have to destroy all the tools

> This leads us to the usual disarmament impasse. (Walker 2009.)

Indeed, just as a community of computer hackers emerged in the second
half of the twentieth century, so too has a group of biohackers -- or
"hobbyists who experiment with DNA and other aspects of genetics" --
recently emerged (see Ayres 2008). Thus, a central concern with broad
relinquishment is that imposing moratoria on an entire domain of
emerging technology would only drive experimentation "underground,"
given that the two necessary conditions of knowledge and equipment are
satisfied (which they are).32 This goes not just for genetic engineering
but nanotechnology as well: relinquishing this field of research would
likely result in the creation of a community of nanohackers -- or
hobbyists who experiment with the technological manipulation of matter
on the nano-scale. And who would argue that a biohacker, or nanohacker,
or any other amateur tinkering with unprecedentedly powerful GNR
technologies would pose less of a risk than professional scientists
working in the controlled environment of the laboratory?

In contrast, the steady-as-she-goes option relinquishes not any
particular field of technological research but rather the use of GNR
technologies to modify the human organism. This position is exemplified
by the bioconservative Francis Fukuyama (2002), who argues that
political liberalism is predicated on the existence of a common
metaphysical essence shared by all humans, since it is in virtue of this
essence that we humans are moral beings with an "inherent value" (and
therefore deserving of equal rights). Thus, by modifying this essence
with person-engineering technologies, the transhumanist project would
extract a necessary ingredient from political liberalism's moral recipe.
It follows that only world-engineering technologies ought to be pursued.
But again, we are left with the crucial question: How might one enforce
such a restriction? Wouldn't any attempt to prevent person-engineering
just drive experimentation underground? And might these underground
person-engineers actually emerge as superior to us "normals" in some
important respect? Kurzweil, in fact, gestures at the plausibility of
the latter scenario in a mock dialogue with Ned Ludd, who expresses
(like Fukuyama) a strong aversion to any technological modification of
the human organism. Kurzweil rejoins to Ludd's anti-technology
protestations: "If you're speaking for yourself, that's fine with me.
But if you stay biological and don't reprogram your genes, you won't be
around for very long to influence the debate" (Kurzweil 2005, 226;
emphasis in original).

Furthermore, [Walker points out that Fukuyama "says nothing about how we
are to address the dual-use problem: the development of 21st century
technologies for peaceful purposes necessarily bring with them the
prospect that the same technology can be used for civilization ending
purposes]{.underline}" (Walker 2009). [It is indeed a nontrivial lacuna
in Fukuyama's vision for the future that he fails to provide any
implementable strategies for controlling and mitigating the existential
risks associated with world-engineering technologies]{.underline} -- the
very same artifactual products of the GNR revolution that would be used
for personengineering purposes. In sum, then, the broad relinquishment
and steady-as-she-goes options both pose serious logistical problems,
the most worrisome of which (in my mind) pertains to the possibility of
engendering a community of clandestine experimentalists driven
"underground" as a result of moratoria imposed on one or more kinds of
technological research.

Before concluding this subsection, though, it is worth taking a brief
look at why the anarcho-primitivist option of comprehensive
relinquishment also fails.33 To begin, recall the problems with
Kurzweil's arguments against primitivism: all those given involve
fallacious mischaracterizations of the position or inaccurate portrayals
of our "primitive" ancestors according the specious "Hobbesian ideology"
(see Zerzan 1998, 258). Nonetheless, there are a number of cogent and
compelling reasons for rejecting the proposition that an
anarcho-primitivist revolution ought to be pursued: for one, recreating
the mode of life had by our Pleistocene forebears would entail a
massive, albeit transitory, increase in human suffering. As Ellul (a
major intellectual source for Kaczynski) notes, "arrest and retreat only
occur when an entire society collapses" (Ellul 1964, 89). [Indeed, given
the world population today, which far exceeds what could be supported by
hunting, gathering, and fishing (especially after the many deleterious
alterations of the environment brought about by human activity -- see
the "Holocene extinction event"), a primitivist revolution would entail
realizing at once all the Malthusian catastrophes that technology has
obviated over the centuries, such as that avoided by the Green
Revolution (which of course introduced a myriad of new and more serious
anthropogenic problems).]{.underline} While one could, and Kaczynski in
fact does, argue along utilitarian lines that the suffering caused by
transitioning to a long lost modus vivendi -- [the "primitivist
singularity" -- would ultimately be less than that resulting from the
GNR revolution, the thought of effectuating such suffering via an
**overthrow of industrial capitalism** and its heteronomous megatechnics
is for most thinkers (present company included) too **morally
repugnant**. We may thus **eliminate** the anarcho-primitivist position
as a viable alternative plan for the future.]{.underline}

And with these negative appraisals we come to our...

> [Conclusion. The futurological program of **transhumanism** ought to
> be **implemented** **rather than the alternative options available,**
> that is, if one wishes to **maximally minimize the inevitable increase
> in the probability of self-annihilation.**]{.underline}

[There are, I have attempted to show, dire eschatological consequences
to all the possible routes into the future thus far proposed: no matter
which is ultimately implemented, our chances of survival have fallen
nontrivially. And, as I have also attempted to establish, technology
constitutes a crucial enabling factor in the network of causes
responsible for our existential plight]{.underline}. But what are the
practical implications of this thesis with respect to transhumanism? If
absolute progress driven by technology is illusory and our future
dismal, then why not jettison -- so to speak -- technology from the ship
of humanity's future?

[My line of reasoning to the conclusion above follows a simple **process
of elimination**: transhumanism offers (what one might call) the
**safest unsafe passage into the future**, that is, compared to the
alternatives specified.]{.underline} [But not only does the
transhumanist program appear to constitute the best option for the
future by avoiding the problems associated with certain forms of
relinquishment, but it might actually contribute positively -- in ways
the alternatives could not -- to the amelioration of our
predicament]{.underline}. I refer here specifically to the creation and
use of cognitive enhancement technologies, including neural implants,
tissue grafts and nootropic drugs (Walker 2008b; Bostrom and Sandberg
2006; Bostrom and Sandberg 2009). After all, who better to grasp,
manipulate and control the problems unique to the GNR revolution than an
advanced "species" of cognitively enhanced posthumans?34 Indeed, as many
authors have noted, [the rapid expansion of human knowledge in the past
several centuries has entailed a corresponding increase in individual
ignorance]{.underline} (Winner 1977, 283; see also Kelly 2008). No
doubt, a major obstacle to effectively guarding against the worse
possible scenarios considered by Bostrom (2002) is epistemic or
cognitive in nature. It thus follows that enhancing our ability to think
carefully, comprehensively and deeply about the (impending) problems
confronting intelligent life on Earth will greatly augment our
collective ability to survive. Person-engineering must not be wholly
restricted.

The general view defended here is, I believe, already implicit in
certain corners of the transhumanist literature: one finds in several
authors a recognition of the technogenicity of our worsening situation
as well as a sense that the best way to fix this situation -- now that
[we have **crossed the Rubicon of technology** -- is more technology,
designed and implemented in a strategically prudent manner.35 Walker,
for example, argues that "even though creating posthumans may be a very
dangerous social experiment, **it is even more dangerous not to attempt
it**: technological advances mean that there is a high probability that
a human-only future will end in extinction"]{.underline} (Walker 2009).
And as I have already discussed, Bostrom has not only recently suggested
that transhumanists eschew the term "progress", but he continues to be a
major intellectual figure in the exploding field of techno-eschatology.

In closing, a primary impetus behind this paper was to make the position
that I have termed rational capitulationism explicit. This involved
refining and elaborating Walker's incipient arguments put forth in his
2009 article. [In pursuing this end, I have attempted to emphasize that
one can be a pessimist about the future, one can identify technology as
the primary cause of our existential plight, and one can hold an
anti-progressionist conception of history while at the same time
advocating the descriptive and normative claims of transhumanism -- in
particular, the moral assertion that we ought to pursue both
worldengineering and person-engineering technologies by fomenting the
GNR revolution. This is, it appears, **our best hope of surviving the
future.**]{.underline}

**[Strong Claims of Inevitability]{.underline}**

Whereas the conservationists often take the offensive in the rhetoric of
risk, the transhumanists clearly are the aggressors in this contest.
First, the [transhumanists convey a sense of **inevitability** through
their sweeping account of **technological innovation**]{.underline}.
This is most effective when describing human history in terms of
successive waves of beneficial technologies used to alter, control, or
bypass nature, for example, fire-building, agriculture, vitamins, and
vaccines. According to proponents, [transtechnologies represent the
**next step in progress**.]{.underline}

Second, outright [inevitability claims]{.underline} are made. I'll
[categorize such claims as ''strong'' when transhumanists declare an
immutable process and ''moderate'' when they assert that social
conditions are, and will continue to be, favorable but not necessarily
causal for the development of transhumanity]{.underline}. I'll start
with the strong claims by identifying the immutable process and where is
it located: (1) Evolution---it operates either in the broad expanse of
the universe or, more specifically, life on earth. (2) Homo cyberneticus
and the drive to self transform--- it is deeply ingrained in human
nature. (3) Technological momentum---exponential growth thought to be an
internal dynamic of technologies. Transhumanists often depict these
processes overlapping, however for the sake of clarity I will describe
each in turn.

Evolution

In the most general sense, evolve means to develop over time. When used
to describe change in organisms over generations the connotation of
improvement often becomes pronounced (especially when our species is the
subject). Charles Darwin preferred the phrase descent with modification
rather than evolve because the former was neutral regarding adaptations.
A modification might provide functional advantage to an organism but
always in response to the demands of the environment at a particular
point in time. Environments change too, and a subsequent modification is
''judged'' in relation to its time and place. As Stephen Jay Gould
asserts, it is all about ''local adaptation, not of general advance or
progress.'' (2007, p. 209)

It is often suggested that the concept of evolution dealt a blow to the
conceit that, of all living beings, humans are unique and privileged.
However, this depends on what version we accept. If we follow Gould's
approach it is hard not to be humbled. He argues that evolution is a
messy affair: punctuated and not gradual, affected by cataclysms (e.g.,
asteroid strike), and very complex--competition or symbiosis playing out
at many levels (genes, individual organisms, and collectives of
organisms). Human evolution and human consciousness were not
preordained: ''Humans arose, rather, as a fortuitous and contingent
outcome of thousands of linked events, any one of which could have
occurred differently and sent history on an alternative pathway that
would not have led to consciousness.'' (211) By asserting that bacteria
are the champions in terms of adaptability and long term success, he
challenges the assumption that humans' most highly regarded faculties
make our species the best fit.

Gould's take on human evolution is not shared by the general public. The
common understanding is that humans are the most evolved species with
regard to thinking, language, and sociality. For many it is a source of
pride to think that nature selects for these capacities and our species
has come out on top. Transhumanists tend to utilize this flattering
interpretation but add the caveat that the selection process continues
and that humans will not be the pinnacle of evolution. Kurzweil (2005)
argues that intelligence provides a competitive advantage because
''\[i\]ntelligence, if sufficiently advanced, is, well, smart enough to
anticipate and overcome any obstacles that stand in its path.'' (206)
Modifications that increase computation power tend to be retained, and
in the long run the trajectory is ever upward. Humans are on the high
end of the continuum of smart species but we will evolve in synergy with
our most advanced technology to become higher-order computation beings.

In his book, Mind Children, Moravec (1998a) predicts that robots with
computation power superior to that of the human brain will eventually
supersede humans. The [transhumanists, in contrast, do not anticipate
that humanity will remain idle.]{.underline} Young's (2006) model of
[''**harmonious complexification''**]{.underline} (366) [portrays life
as moving toward increasing order, complexity, and self-organization and
he sees humans as both **producer** and product of this
process.]{.underline} [**Our species will initiate and ride the
transhuman** and posthuman **wave**. Kurzweil emphasizes the
**inevitability of this progression**:]{.underline}

\[W\]e are a product of evolution, indeed its cutting edge. But
[extending our intelligence by reverse engineering it, modeling it,
simulating it, reinstantiating it on more capable substrates, and
modifying and extending it is the next step in evolution]{.underline}.
It was the fate of bacteria to evolve into a technology-creating
species. [And it's our destiny now to evolve into the vast intelligence
of the Singularity]{.underline} (298).

Transhumanists also describe evolution as if it were a steamroller.
Evolution is the driving force of life and it crushes species that fail
to keep pace with change. [Given **evolutionary pressure**, the human
species must move forward as a **matter of survival**. Furthermore,
humans must continually **adapt to sociotechnological** **change** or
else risk being left behind. To avoid enslavement or **extinction**,
**humans must become transhuman** to stay ahead of robots or AI entities
in computation power]{.underline}.

[Homo Cyberneticus]{.underline}

A superior motivational system is not based solely on avoidance of harm;
inspiration and commitment to a creative project are important as well.
The transhumanists understand this and make sure to balance the concern
for being displaced by machines with the promise of self-transformation.
Evolution may be harsh and unforgiving but, according to the
transhumanists, evolution has produced one species, homo sapiens, that
is equipped and prepared to direct it. We are ''steersmen,'' Homo
cyberneticus, proclaims Simon Young. This is a bold declaration meant to
inspire confidence and forward-thinking.

Clark (2003) explains that **[we are the creative
project]{.underline}**. [In other words, because we are essentially
**dynamic** and **self-constructing** and have the **ability to expand
with our technologies**, we will continue to be the most innovative
species.]{.underline}

Our self-image as a species should not be that of ancient biological
minds in colorful young technological clothes. Instead, ours are
chameleon minds, factory-primed to merge with what they find and with
what they themselves create (141). [Our cognitive machinery is now
**intrinsically geared** **to self-transformation**, artifactbased
expansion, and a snowballing/bootstrapping process of computational and
representational growth... Plasticity and multiplicity are our true
constants]{.underline} (8).

[The transition to transhumanity is not only **manageable** but is
**expected** of ''natural-born cyborgs.'']{.underline}

**[Technological Momentum]{.underline}**

In a paper published in 1965, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel,
described how the number of transistors per square inch on integrated
circuits had doubled every year between 1959 and 1965. He suggested that
the trend might continue indefinitely. Moore's Law can be cautiously
interpreted as a useful observation of past accomplishments or it can be
understood as a predictor of future developments. Winner (1997)
identifies a number of well-known writers including Nicolas Negroponte,
George Gilder, Alvin Toffler, and Esther Dyson as expressing the latter
view. Moravec (1998b) extends the trend line for MIPS (millions of
instructions per second) into the future to make the case that increase
in computation power will allow for the rise of super-intelligent
robots: ''At the present rate, computers suitable for humanlike robots
will appear in the 2020s. Can the pace be sustained for another three
decades? The graph shows no sign of abatement.'' (6)

According to Kurzweil's (2001) ''law of accelerating returns,'' the rate
of technological change is greater than commonly understood because

[**technological change is exponential**.]{.underline} In exponential
growth, we find that a key measurement such as computational power is
multiplied by a constant factor for each unit of time (e.g., doubling
every year) rather than just being added to incrementally.
[**Exponential growth** is a feature of any **evolutionary process**, of
which technology is a primary example.]{.underline} One can examine the
data in different ways, on different time scales, and for a wide variety
of technologies ranging from electronic to biological, and the
acceleration of progress and growth applies. Indeed, we find not just
simple exponential growth, but ''double'' exponential growth, meaning
that the rate of exponential growth is itself growing exponentially.
These observations do not rely merely on an assumption of the
continuation of Moore's law (i.e., the exponential shrinking of
transistor sizes on an integrated circuit), but is based on a rich model
of diverse technological processes.

In his most expansive projections he takes for granted that exponential
growth will continue unabated and that ''it will only take a quarter of
a millennium (in our own case) to go from sending messages on horseback
to saturating the matter and energy in our solar system with sublimely
intelligent processes.'' (Kurzweil 2007) Even the major social
disturbances of the twentienth century have not delayed this
progression: ''But the evolution of intelligence here on Earth is
actually going very well. All of the vagaries (and tragedies) of human
history, such as two world wars, the cold war, the great depression, and
other notable events, did not make even the slightest dent in the
ongoing exponential progressions I previously mentioned.''

It should be noted that Gordon Moore [**resists technological
determinism**, i.e., the view that technology is an autonomous force and
proceeds according to internal dynamics]{.underline}. He believes that
[**social forces are pivotal** to microchip advances, specifically, a
collective-fulfilling prophecy is at work]{.underline} in which
projected trends become benchmarks for industry competition. Maybe it is
a byproduct of his macro level of analysis, but Kurzweil's law of
accelerating returns does comes across as being deterministic. He
insists that exponential growth will be sustained until it finally comes
up against fundamental constraints of physics. Social constraints or,
for that matter, social factors behind the construction and diffusion of
technologies receive little attention.

Being more cautious, other transhumanists make use of the ceteris
paribus clause, for instance, ''if funding for research continues,''
''as long as we dispel irrational fears,'' etc. Even so, they cite the
same exponential trends and make the same extrapolations as Kurzweil.
Hughes (2004), for example, employs Moore's Law as a template for growth
rates in many fields and he predicts that

NBIC technologies \[nanotechnology, biotechnology, information
technology and cognitive science\] will definitely also change how we
work, how we travel, how we communicate, how we worship and how we cook.
But the most fundamental changes in our lived experience will come from
their impacts on our bodies and brains (7--8).

For Hughes it is not a [question of whether technological advances will
continue (they will), but how advances can be managed to best realize
social values such as liberty and equality.]{.underline}

[**Technological acceleration**, **evolution**, and **Homo
cyberneticus** **resound with the march of progress**. This is a
**powerful theme** in Western civilization that is **now common to
global culture**]{.underline}. [It is **very difficult to deny or
discredit.** Critics may find it easier to dismiss the transhumanists'
assertion that it will turn out good in the end than to dispel the
common belief that there is no stopping change.]{.underline}

[Option: transhumanism future.]{.underline}

[The transhumanist future is one where both world-engineering and
person-engineering are permitted. Specifically, as noted, the
transhumanist view is that we should create persons who are smarter and
more virtuous than we are. The application to our problem is obvious:
our fears about the misuse of 21st century technology reduce down to
fears about stupidity or viciousness. Like the Australian research
scientists, the worry is that we may be the authors of an accident, but
this time one of apocalyptic proportions: the end of civilization.
Likewise, our moral natures may also cause our demise. Or, to put a more
positive spin on it, the best candidates amongst us to lead civilization
through such perilous times are the brightest and most virtuous:
posthumans.17]{.underline}

[It is worth pointing out that there is no need to deny what Fukuyama
claims: there are real dangers in creating posthumans. The problem with
the transhumanist project, says Fukuyama, comes when we think seriously
about what characteristics to change:]{.underline}

> [Our good characteristics are intimately connected to our bad ones: If
> we weren't violent and aggressive, we wouldn't be able to defend
> ourselves; if we didn't have feelings of exclusivity, we wouldn't be
> loyal to those close to us; if we never felt jealousy, we would never
> feel love. Even morality plays a critical function in allowing our
> species as a whole to survive and adapt.... Modifying any one of our
> key characteristics inevitably entails modifying a complex,
> interlinked package of traits, and we will never be able to anticipate
> the ultimate outcome.18]{.underline}

[So, although Fukuyama sees the pull of transhumanism, how it might look
"downright reasonable", the fact that traits we might hope to modify are
interconnected means that "we will never be able to anticipate the
ultimate outcome."]{.underline}

[What Fukuyama fails to address in any systematic way is the fact that
there are even **greater dangers** associated with **not creating
posthumans**. So, a prudential and moral reason for creating posthumans
is not that this is without risk, rather, it is less risky than the
alternative here: steady-as-she-goes. If forced to put some hard numbers
to these scenarios, I would venture to suggest there is a 90% chance of
civilization surviving the next two centuries if we follow the
transhumanist path, while I would put the chances of civilization
surviving a steady-as-she-goes policy at less than 20%. But then, I am
an optimist.]{.underline}

[It might be objected that it is foolhardy or worse to try to put such
numbers to futures where so much is uncertain. I have some sympathy with
this objection. Thinking about the future where so much is uncertain is
hardly analogous to putting odds on a horse race. On the other hand, a
lot more is at stake in thinking about our future and so we have no
choice but to try to estimate as best we can various risks. If it were
protested that it is simply impossible to make any meaningful estimate
then this would prove too much. For then there would be no reason to
think that the transhumanist future is any more risky than any other
future. In other words, the complaint that the transhumanist future is
risky has traction only if we have some comparative evaluation in mind.
Surgery that has only a 1 in 10 chance of survival is not risky,
comparatively speaking, if the chances of survival without the surgery
are zero. **Anyone who criticizes transhumanism** for putting
civilization at risk, as does Fukuyama, must explicitly or **implicitly
hold** that the **chances of survival** in a **non-transhumanist
future** are greater. This is what transhumanists **deny**.]{.underline}

[This line of thinking is further reinforced when we consider that there
is a limit to the downside of creating posthumans, at least relatively
speaking. That is, one of the traditional concerns about increasing
knowledge is that it seems to always imply an associated risk for
greater destructive capacity. One way this point is made is in terms of
'killing capacity': muskets are a more powerful technology than a bow
and arrow, and tanks more powerful than muskets, and atomic bombs even
more destructive than tanks. The knowledge that made possible these
technical advancements brought a concomitant increase in capacity for
evil. Interestingly, we have almost **hit the wall** in our **capacity
for evil**: once you have civilization destroying weapons there is not
much worse you can do. There is a point in which the one-upmanship for
evil comes to an end---when everyone is dead. If you will forgive the
somewhat graphic analogy, it hardly matters to Kennedy if his head is
blown off with a rifle or a cannon. Likewise, if A has a weapon that can
kill every last person there is little difference between that and B's
weapon which is twice as powerful.]{.underline}

[Posthumans probably won't have much more capacity for evil than we
have, or are likely to have shortly. So, at least in terms of how many
persons can be killed, posthumans will not outstrip us in this capacity.
This is not to say that there are no new worries with the creation of
posthumans, but **the greatest evil**, the **destruction of
civilization**, is something which we now, or will soon, have. In other
words, the most significant aspect that we should focus on with
contemplating the creation of posthumans is their upside. They are not
likely to **distinguish themselves** in their capacity for evil, since
we have already pretty much hit the wall on that, but for their
**capacity for good.**]{.underline}

### Thesis=Wrong

#### Tech doesn't overdetermine the social. The potential for uncontrollable tech doesn't mean tech [controls us]{.underline}.

**Gulson et. al. 22** - Doctor of Philosophy, Professor at University of
Sydney, current research investigates whether new knowledge, methods and
technologies from life and computing sciences, with a specific focus on
Artificial Intelligence, will substantively alter education policy and
governance. "Algorithms of Education: How Datafication and Artificial
Intelligence Shape Policy." May 2022. AG

Automation, Technology, and Governance

[Many **critical perspectives of technology** continue to center a human
actor]{.underline} as either a participant, user, or [object of
technological decisionmaking]{.underline}.9 We would, perhaps a little
unfairly to some, locate much of this work in the instrumentalist view,
where [technology is seen to be a **tool serving human
ends**]{.underline}. [Even approaches that treat AI and algorithms as
**sociotechnical assemblages** can continue to treat these technologies
as tools to be utilized, resisted, or ameliorated.]{.underline} This
section provides an overview of theories of technology that move beyond
the dichotomous view of humans and machines that, as noted above, tends
to dominate current discussions of AI and algorithms in education
governance. We turn to concepts that suggest "[we can think, signify,
make sense and represent who we are in part only because of
technology."]{.underline}10 We examine what this [**conceptualization**
means for understanding the links between technology, automation, and
governance]{.underline}.

The view of human-technology relations that we take up is the
"substantivist" position, according to which [technology is a dynamic
system that "is a decisive mediator of social actions and cultural
values]{.underline}."11 Stiegler, in a detailed theorization of
"technics," which he defines broadly to include the first Stone Age
artifacts and the latest digital platforms, argues that [technology and
culture are irreducible]{.underline}.12 Roberts outlines that, for
Stiegler, culture can be understood as

> the [product of technics]{.underline} as the prosthetic relationship
> between the human and its "**[exteriorisation]{.underline}**" in
> matter. [Technics therefore does not have the instrumental sense of
> technology as a tool that the human makes use of but rather defines
> the human as no longer simply a biological being]{.underline}.13

There is constant movement between two nonautonomous agents in the
imbrication of humans and machines. As Mackenzie notes, "[The technical
runs ahead of culture]{.underline}, but it is not alone. [It enlists
humans to power its instantiation. . . . It is not autonomous or
intrinsically dynamic]{.underline}." **[Technology has collective
implications;]{.underline}** [it shapes the social, cultural,
andpolitical conditions of human life, but this **does not imply
technological determinism.**]{.underline}14 As Roden argues, "[While
technology exerts a powerful influence on individuals, society and
culture, this **cannot be an 'autonomous' influence** because there are
not ends or purposes proper to it."15]{.underline}

Stiegler's emphasis on exteriorization provides a helpful way to
theorize machines and governance, including exploring the emerging
political rationalities of anticipation, prediction, and automation. For
Stiegler, exteriorization describes the condensation of culture into
"prosthetic" artifacts that augment human action (e.g., a hammer). [An
example of exteriorization is the significant shift from statistical
governance to **algorithmic governmentality**,]{.underline} which
results in "a certain type of (a)normative or (a)political rationality
[founded on the **automated collection**]{.underline}, aggregation and
analysis of big data so as to model, anticipate and pre-emptively affect
possible behaviours."16

The combination of automation and behaviorist approaches allows us to
begin to examine how [governance is increasingly exteriorized as aspects
of the **cognitive processes** involved in governance become condensed
into machines]{.underline}.17 [Increasingly, governance is operating
through machines that are changing the organization of life, and thus
"the **critique of the evolution of artificial networks** must
concentrate on their emergent powers of cognitive, somatic and economic
synchronization]{.underline}."18 In other words, the so-called black
boxes of AI, schools, classrooms, and even educational systems
themselves inscribe autonomous interiorities to these objects. Thus,
initiatives designed to produce "explainable AI," for example, are
attempts to expose the interiorities of AI, which for our purposes are
the exact same logics, discourses, and rationalities that have governed
classrooms, schools, and educational systems for the past forty years
and that have been exteriorized into new platforms.19 In contrast[, we
will emphasize the synthetic relationship between the exteriorization of
human culture and its folding back into human cognition through our
engagement with machines.]{.underline}

[Central to our theorization of synthetic thought]{.underline} is what
Roden calls "[**new substantivism**," and self-augmenting technical
systems. This perspective does not collapse automation into autonomy or
suggest that self-augmenting technical systems are
self-aware.]{.underline} Self-augmenting techniques, and specifically
the forms of AI and automation upon which we focus, are those that are
technically abstract, but the "techniques do not determine how they are
used."20 Examples include the wide applications of machine learning,
from medicine to streaming services and online shopping platforms.
Recommender systems that anticipate userpreferences are another example.
While mostly used in business applications, these shape everything from
what song is recommended next in a streaming service like Spotify to
what problem should be undertaken in an adaptive math tutoring program.
As Roden argues, "Techniques are more abstract the more they are
available for reapplication or reconfiguration in disparate contexts."21
We might suggest, therefore, that in education governance different
applications will employ different algorithms, and there is an abstract
isomorphic relationship between algorithmic approaches adopted across
myriad contexts, from funding, resourcing and predictions of results.

[With the increasingly widespread use of algorithms and AI, we suggest
**self-augmenting technical systems** are beginning to **reshape** not
only what is knowable but also what is doable]{.underline}. A system of
this kind "[**does not remove human agency** but mediates it through
networks where no single agent or collective is able to exercise
decisive control over the technical system]{.underline}."22 These
technical systems act as [**catalysts** for further action rather than
**determining** this action]{.underline}. Machines are thus creating
semiautonomous conditions of existence, and in doing so they are
creating new conditions of possibility for what we can understand as
action and control in education governance. As Savat posits,

> [any technology, or machine, opens up a specific form of action,
> recognising that thought too is a form of action. At the same time,
> any technology or machine may close off certain forms of
> action]{.underline} (and thought).23

Much of the work on technology and governance indicates that control is
difficult if not impossible to ascertain, because "the order of a
network is total and open, horizontal and distributive, inclusive and
universal."24 Therefore, [it may be that we need to come to grips with
an idea of **technology and governance that is neither controllable nor
in control**]{.underline}. As Roden suggests,

> [we **need not attribute agency** or purposiveness to technology to
> explain why the **evolution of technical systems eludes our control**.
> If technology is "out of control" **it does not follow that it is "in
> control" of us or under its own control**]{.underline}.25

[If technology is neither in nor under control, then we need to grapple
with the possibility that new types of governance systems exteriorize
thought by automating certain cognitive processes]{.underline}.
[However, automation,]{.underline} if we follow Roden, **[does not mean
rendering governance fully autonomous]{.underline}**. [Yet automation
does reinforce digital data that become the basis of algorithmic
governmentality and that can **change the possibilities** for political
agency and governance]{.underline}. As noted by Crogan, Stiegler posits
that "algorithmic governmentality disrupts established material and
institutional arrangements for producing and verifying truth."26
[Through forms of automated decision-making]{.underline}, [governance
takes the individual and **fragments** it]{.underline}, instantiating a
central insight of Deleuze's theorization of societies of control, which
involve the transformation of populations--- which were the object of
governance in disciplinary societies--- into "samples, data, markets,
banks" and individuals into "dividuals," or "numbered bodies of coded
'dividual' matter to be controlled."27

### AT: AI Impacts

#### No tech accidents, no algorithmic arms race. 

Michael **Shermer 17**. Publisher of Skeptic magazine, a monthly
columnist for Scientific American, and a Presidential Fellow at Chapman
University. 04/2017. "Why Artificial Intelligence Is Not an Existential
Threat." Skeptic, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 29--35.

Why AI is not an Existential Threat First, [most [AI doomsday
prophecies]{.mark} [are grounded in]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[[false
analogy]{.underline}]{.mark}** [between]{.underline} **[human
nature]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**computer nature**, or natural
intelligence and artificial intelligence. We are thinking machines, but
natural selection also designed into us]{.underline}
**[emotions]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[shortcut]{.underline}**
the **[thinking]{.underline}** process because natural intelligences are
limited in speed and capacity by the number of neurons that can be
crammed into a skull that has to pass through a pelvic opening at birth,
whereas artificial intelligence need not be so restricted. We don\'t
need to compute the caloric value of foods, for example, we just feel
hungry. We don\'t need to calculate the waist-to-hip ratio of women or
the shoulder-to-waist ratio of men in our quest for genetically healthy
potential mates; we just feel attracted to someone and mate with them.
We don\'t need to work out the genetic cost of raising someone else\'s
offspring if our mate is unfaithful; we just feel jealous. We don\'t
need to figure the damage of an unfair or non-reciprocal exchange with
someone else; we just feel injustice and desire revenge. [Emotions
are]{.underline} **[proxies]{.underline}** [for getting us to
act]{.underline} in ways that lead to an increase in reproductive
success, particularly [in response to threats]{.underline} faced by our
Paleolithic ancestors. Anger leads us to strike out, fight back, and
defend ourselves against danger. Fear causes us to pull back, retreat,
and escape from risks. Disgust directs us to push out, eject, and expel
that which is bad for us. [[Computing]{.mark} the [odds of
danger]{.mark} in any given situation [takes too long.]{.mark} [We need
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[react instantly]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Emotions shortcut the information processing power needed by brains that
would otherwise become bogged down with all the computations necessary
for survival. [Their purpose, in an ultimate causal sense, is to drive
behaviors toward goals selected by evolution to]{.underline} **[enhance
survival]{.underline}** and reproduction. **[[AIs]{.underline}]{.mark}**
\-- even AGIs and ASIs \-- [[will have]{.underline} **[no
need]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[such
emotions]{.underline}]{.mark} and so there would be no reason to program
them in unless, say, terrorists chose to do so for their own evil
purposes. But that\'s a human nature problem, not a computer nature
issue. [To believe that an ASI would be]{.underline}
**[\"evil\"]{.underline}** in any emotional sense [is to assume a
computer cognition that includes such psychological traits
as]{.underline} [**acquisitiveness**, competitiveness, vengeance, and
bellicosity, which seem to be projections coming from the
mostly]{.underline} **[male writers]{.underline}** [who]{.underline}
**[concoct]{.underline}** such [**dystopias**, not features any
**programmer**]{.underline} [would]{.underline} [**bother including**,
assuming that it]{.underline} [**could even be done**. What would it
mean to program an emotion into a computer? When IBM\'s Deep Blue
defeated chess master Garry Kasparov]{.underline} in 1997, [did it feel
**triumphant**]{.underline}, vengeful, or bellicose? [**Of course not**.
It **wasn\'t even \"aware\"**]{.underline} [\-- in the human sense of
self-conscious knowledge \-- that it was]{.underline} [**playing
chess**, much less feeling nervous about possibly losing]{.underline} to
the reigning world champion (which it did in the first tournament played
in 1996). In fact, toward the end of the first game of the second
tournament, on the 44th move, Deep Blue made a legal but
incomprehensible move of pushing its rook all the way to the last row of
the opposition side. It accomplished nothing offensively or defensively,
leading Kasparov to puzzle over it out of concern that he was missing
something in the computer\'s strategy. It turned out to be an error in
Deep Blue\'s programming that led to this fail-safe default move. It was
a bug that Kasparov mistook as a feature, and as a result some chess
experts contend it led him to be less confident in his strategizing and
to second-guess his responses in the subsequent games. It even led him
to suspect foul play and human intervention behind Deep Blue, and this
paranoia ultimately cost him the tournamentt.\[ 13\] Computers don\'t
get paranoid, the HAL 9000 computer in 2001 notwithstanding. [Or
consider **Watson**]{.underline}, the IBM computer built by David
Ferrucci and his team of IBM research scientists tasked with designing
an AI that could rival human champions at the game of Jeopardy! This was
a far more formidable challenge than Deep Blue faced because of the
prerequisite to understand language and the often multiple meanings of
words, not to mention needing an encyclopedic knowledge of trivia
(Watson had access to Wikipedia for this). After beating the all-time
greatest Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011, did
Watson feel flushed with pride after its victory? Did Watson even know
that it won Jeopardy!? I put the question to none other than Ferrucci
himself at a dinner party in New York in conjunction with the 2011
Singularity Summit. His answer surprised me: \"Yes, [Watson knows it won
Jeopardy!]{.underline}\" I was skeptical. How could that be, since such
self-awareness is not yet possible in computers? \"[Because]{.underline}
**[I told it]{.underline}** that it won,\" he replied with a wry smile.
Sure, and you could even program Watson or Deep Blue to vocalize a
Howard Dean-like victory scream when it wins, but that is [still
a]{.underline} **[far cry]{.underline}** [from a computer feeling
triumphant]{.underline}. [This brings to mind the **\"hard problem\" of
consciousness**]{.underline} [\-- if we don\'t understand how this
happens in humans,]{.underline} **[how could we program it into
computers?]{.underline}** As Steven Pinker elucidated in his answer to
the 2015 Edge Question on what to think about machines that think, [\"AI
dystopias project a]{.underline} **[parochial alpha-male
psychology]{.underline}** [onto the]{.underline} [**concept of
intelligence**. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would
develop **goals** like **deposing their masters**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[taking over the world.\"]{.underline}** [It
is]{.underline} **[equally possible]{.underline}**, Pinker suggests,
[that \"[artificial intelligence will naturally develop]{.mark}
along]{.underline} female [lines]{.underline}: fully capable of solving
problems, but [[with]{.underline} **[no desire to]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[annihilate innocents]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[or]{.underline}
**[dominate the civilization]{.underline}**]{.mark}.\"\[ 14\] So [the
fear that computers will become emotionally evil are unfounded, because
without the suite of these evolved emotions [it
will]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[never occur to AIs]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[to take such actions]{.mark} against us]{.underline}. [What about an
ASI **inadvertently**]{.underline} [causing]{.underline} our
[extinction]{.underline} by turning us into paperclips, or tiling the
entire Earth\'s surface with solar panels? [Such scenarios imply yet
another emotion \-- the feeling of]{.underline}
**[valuing]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[wanting
something]{.underline}**. As the science writer Michael Chorost adroitly
notes, [when humans resist an AI from undertaking any form of global
tiling, it \"will have to be able to]{.underline} **[imagine
counteractions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**want to carry them
out**.\" Yet, \"until an [AI]{.mark} has feelings, it\'s going to be
[unable to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**want [to do anything]{.mark} at
all**, [let alone **act counter to humanity\'**]{.mark}**s
interests**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[fight off human
resistance]{.underline}**.\" Further, Chorost notes, \"the minute an
A.I. wants anything, it will live in a universe with rewards and
punishments \-- including punishments from us for behaving badly. In
order [to survive in a world dominated by humans, a nascent A.I. will
have to develop a humanlike moral sense that certain things are right
and others are wrong. By the time it\'s in a position to **imagine**
tiling the Earth with solar panels, it\'ll **know that it would be
morally wrong**]{.underline} to do so.\"\[ 15\] From here Chorost builds
on an argument made by Peter Singer in The Expanding Circle (and Steven
Pinker in The Better Angels of Our Nature\[ 16\] that I also developed
in The Moral Arc\[ 17\] and Robert Wright explored in Nonzero\[ 18\]),
and that is the propensity for natural intelligence to evolve moral
emotions that include reciprocity, cooperativeness, and even altruism.
Natural intelligences such as ours also includes the capacity to reason,
and once you are on Singer\'s metaphor of the \"escalator of reason\" it
can carry you upward to genuine morality and concerns about harming
others. \"Reasoning is inherently expansionist. It seeks universal
application,\" Singer notes.\[ 19\] Chorost draws the implication:
\"[AIs will have to step on the escalator of reason just like humans
have, because they will need to]{.underline} **[bargain for goods in a
human-dominated economy]{.underline}** [and they will face **human
resistance to bad behavior**]{.underline}.\"\[ 20\] Finally, [for an AI
to get around this problem it would need to evolve emotions on its own,
but the only way for this to happen in a world dominated by the natural
intelligence called humans would be [for]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[us]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[to]{.underline} **[allow it to
happen]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, [which we
**wouldn\'t**]{.mark}]{.underline} [because there\'s]{.underline}
[**time enough to see it coming**. **[Bostrom\'s \"treacherous turn\"
will come with road signs ahead]{.mark}**]{.underline} warning us that
there\'s a sharp bend in the highway with enough time for us to grab the
wheel. [Incremental progress is what we see in most technologies,
including and especially AI, which will continue to serve us in **the
manner we desire and need**]{.underline}. Instead of Great Leap Forward
or Giant Fall Backward, think Small Steps Upward. As I proposed in The
Moral Arc, [instead of Utopia or dystopia, think]{.underline}
**[protopia]{.underline}**, a term coined by the futurist Kevin Kelly,
who described it in an Edge conversation this way: \"I call myself a
protopian, not a Utopian. I believe in progress in an incremental way
where every year it\'s better than the year before but not by very much
\-- just a micro amount.\"\[ 21\] Almost all progress in science and
technology, including computers and AI, is of a protopian nature.
Rarely, if ever, do technologies lead to either Utopian or dystopian
societies. Pinker agrees that [[there is]{.underline} **[plenty of
time]{.underline}** [to plan]{.underline}]{.mark} [for all conceivable
contingencies and build safeguards into our AI systems. \"They would not
need any ponderous \'rules of robotics\' or some newfangled **moral
philosophy**]{.underline} [to do this, just the same]{.underline}
**[common sense]{.underline}** [that went into the design
of]{.underline} **[food processors]{.underline}**, **[table
saws]{.underline}**, **[space heaters]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[automobiles]{.underline}**.\" [Sure, an ASI would be many orders of
magnitude]{.underline} **[smarter]{.underline}** [than
these]{.underline} machines, [but [Pinker reminds us of
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[AI hyperbole]{.underline}** [we\'ve been
fed for decades]{.underline}]{.mark}[: \"The worry that an [AI]{.mark}
system would be **so clever**]{.underline} at attaining one of the goals
programmed into it (like commandeering energy) [that it would **run
roughshod over**]{.underline} the **[others]{.underline}** (like human
safety) [[assumes that AI will descend upon us]{.mark} **[faster than we
can design]{.mark} fail-safe [precautions]{.mark}**. The reality is that
progress in AI is]{.underline} [**hype-defyingly slow**, and there will
be plenty of time for feedback from incremental implementations, with
humans wielding the screwdriver at every stage.\"]{.underline}\[ 22\]
Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt agrees, responding to the fears expressed
by Hawking and Musk this way: [\"Don\'t you think the humans would
notice this, and start **turning off the computers**?\"]{.underline} He
also noted the irony in the fact that Musk has invested \$1 billion into
a company called OpenAI that is \"promoting precisely AI of the kind we
are describing.\"\[ 23\] [Google\'s own DeepMind has developed the
concept of an **AI off-switch**, playfully described as a **\"big red
button\"**]{.underline} to be pushed in the event of an attempted AI
takeover. \"We have proposed a framework to allow a human operator to
repeatedly safely interrupt a reinforcement learning agent while making
sure the agent will not learn to prevent or induce these
interruptions,\" write the authors Laurent Orseau from DeepMind and
Stuart Armstrong from the Future of Humanity Institute, in a paper
titled \"Safely Interruptible Agents.\" They even suggest a
precautionary scheduled shutdown every night at 2 AM for an hour so that
both humans and AI are accustomed to the idea. [\"Safe interruptibility
can be useful to take control of a robot that is
misbehaving]{.underline} and may lead to irreversible consequences, or
to take it out of a delicate situation, or even to temporarily use it to
achieve a task it did not learn to perform or would not normally receive
rewards for this.\"\[ 24\] [As well, it is good to keep in mind that
artificial intelligence is not the same as artificial **consciousness**.
Thinking machines **may not be sentient**]{.underline} machines.
Finally, Andrew Ng of Baidu responded to Elon Musk\'s ASI concerns by
noting (in a jab at the entrepreneur\'s ambitions for colonizing the red
planet) it would be \"like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we
have not even set foot on the planet yet.\"\[ 25\] Both Utopian and
dystopian visions of AI are based on a projection of the future quite
unlike anything history has given us. Yet, even Ray Kurzweil\'s \"law of
accelerating returns,\" as remarkable as it has been has nevertheless
advanced at a pace that has allowed for considerable ethical
deliberation with appropriate checks and balances applied to various
technologies along the way. With time, [even if an unforeseen motive
somehow began to emerge in an AI we would have the **time to reprogram
it** before it got out of control]{.underline}. That is also the
judgment of Alan Winfield, an engineering professor and co-author of the
Principles of Robotics, a list of rules for regulating robots in the
real world that goes far beyond Isaac Asimov\'s famous three laws of
robotics (which were, in any case, designed to fail as plot devices for
science fictional narratives).26 Winfield points out that
[all]{.underline} of these [doomsday scenarios depend on a]{.underline}
**[long sequence of big ifs]{.underline}** [to unroll
sequentially:]{.underline} \"If we succeed in building human equivalent
AI and if that AI acquires a full understanding of how it works, and if
it then succeeds in improving itself to produce super-intelligent AI,
and if that super-AI, accidentally or maliciously, starts to consume
resources, and if we fail to pull the plug, then, yes, we may well have
a problem. [The risk, while not impossible, is
**improbable**]{.underline}.\"\[ 27\]

prototyping, subtracting, regulating, restoring, optimizing, leaving
alone, splicing, gardening and evacuating than about reading, examining,
insisting, rethinking, reminding, knowing full-well, enacting, finding
problematic, and urging. (303)

No doubt. And, not that I don't share the frustration, but [I **wonder**
what a **highly technical**]{.underline}, 500-page [**diagnosis** of the
**contemporary state of software** and **sovereignty published** and
**distributed by an academic press** and **written for an academic
audience** is if not **discoursing**? It seems **unlikely** that it can
**serve as a blueprint** for any **actually-existing power
brokers**]{.underline}, even though its insights are tremendous. At the
risk of sounding cynical, [calling The Stack a "**design brief**" seems
like a **preemptive move** to **liberate**]{.underline} Bratton [from
having to **seriously engage** with the different critical traditions
that work to **make sense of the world as it is** in order to **demand
something better**. This allows for a certain amount of **intellectual
play** that can sometimes **feel exhilarating** but can just as often
read as a **dodge**---as a way of **escaping the ethical** and
**political stakes** that inhere in critique]{.underline}.

[That is an **important elision** for a text that is **explicitly trying
to imagine** the geopolitics of the future. Bratton seems to pose The
Stack from a **nebulous "Left" position** that is]{.underline} equally
[**disdainful** of]{.underline} the sort of ["**Folk
Politics**"]{.underline} that Srnicek and Williams (2015) so loathe and
the accelerationist tinge of the Speculative Realists with whom he seems
spiritually aligned. This sense of rootlessness sometimes works in
Bratton's favor. There are long stretches in which his cherry picking
and remixing ideas from across a bewildering array of schools of thought
yields real insights. But just as often, [the]{.underline} "design
brief" [characterization **seems to be a way out** of **thinking the
implications of the conjuncture through to their
conclusion**]{.underline}. There is a breeziness about how Bratton poses
futures-as-thought-experiments that is troubling.

For instance, in thinking through the potential impacts of the capacity
to measure planetary processes in real time, Bratton suggests that
producing a sensible world is not only a process of generalizing
measurement and representation. He argues that

the sensibility of the world might be distributed or organized, made
infrastructural, and activated to become part of how the landscape
understands itself and narrates itself. It is not only a diagnostic
image then; it is a tool for geo-politics in formation, emerging from
the parametric multiplication and algorithmic conjugation of our surplus
projections of worlds to come, perhaps in mimetic accordance with one
explicit utopian conception or another, and perhaps not. Nevertheless,
the decision between what is and is not governable may arise as much
from what the model computational image cannot do as much as what it
can. (301, emphasis added)

Reading this, I wanted to know: [**What explicit utopian project** is he
thinking about? **What are the implications** of it **going one way**
and **not another**?]{.underline} Why mimetic? What does the last bit
about what is and is not governable mean? Or, more to the point:
[**who** and **what is going to get killed** if it **goes one way** and
**not another**?]{.underline} There are a great many instances like this
over the course of the book. [At the **precise moment** where analysis
might inform an understanding of **where The Stack is taking us**,
Bratton **bows out**]{.underline}. He's set down the stakes, and given a
couple of ideas about what might happen. I guess that's what a design
brief is meant to do.

### Notes

Evidence from the starter packet file and from the neg section in this
file can both be useful for case extensions/answers to other off-case
positions; I just didn't want to be any more duplicative than necessary.
I tried to largely keep stuff specific to the aff here.

I think this is a strategic K aff against framework and against K
strats. In the latter context, you might want to defend more of the
"governable" part of "governable stacks"---take a look at the
"Governance Turn" card for more of an idea for that. Part of the
"governable stacks" proposal certainly involves governance, but I think
that it can be possible to walk a line of saying that the aff can say
the state is not always irredeemably awful without having to defend USFG
action in the plan---see more in the framework notes section.

I would recommend researching the (many, many) examples in the 1AC
Schneider evidence!

#### Thus, when exploring how we [can]{.underline} debate it, "we must resist deciding in favor of catastrophe or boredom, for in doing so, the entirety of cyberwar will certainly escape us.

[[At the start of the twenty-first century]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we
are faced with the **increasing dependence** of our life support systems
on global networks and the possibility of **system-wide
catastrophe**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[From **energy supplies** to
**agriculture** to the **global climate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[these
systems are now directly exposed to]{.underline}]{.mark} global
fluctuations and, with them, [[the possibility that a local breakdown
could **spread globally**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[We seem to be
**learning repeatedly** that the **unavoidable dark side** of our
networks of]{.underline}]{.mark} communication, production, finance, and
[[information is the ever-present threat of **contagion** and
**cascading system failure**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Nowhere is]{.underline} the logic of [this threat]{.underline} of
global system breakdown [**clearer** than in the expanding discourse
around **cyberwar**]{.underline}. Over the past decades, [a **growing
chorus**]{.underline} of politicians, military strategists, computer
security experts, and journalists [has cited the **dangers** and
**opportunities** that the subversion of digital systems provides for
future conflicts]{.underline}. Governments are investing increasing
amounts of energy and money in guaranteeing that they can attack,
subvert, and monitor opponents' digital networks, from
command-and-control systems to banking to electric grids. The early
outbreaks of cyberwar, such as a series of [Russian attacks on
**Estonia** in **2007**]{.underline}, have [resulted mainly in
**temporary inconveniences**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} as
militaries invest in being able to destroy physical infrastructure
through networked attacks and governments attempt to subvert other
states, [future cyberwars threaten the possibility of **massive
destruction**]{.underline} and destabilization.

Cyberwar seizes directly on the networked nature of twenty-firstcentury
economic, military, and communicative power by exploiting
vulnerabilities, bugs, and insecurities in the code and systems that run
these networks; the more well connected and technologically advanced one
is, the more one has to fear the contagious threat of both networked
accidents and attacks. The military investment in cyberwar and the
political, media, and economic responses to acts of cyberwar speak
directly to the complicated nature of our networks and information
technologies. It is here, where these technical, programmatic, and
social systems begin to break down and are transformed into sites of
military intervention, that we can most fully begin to elucidate what is
at stake in these global networks.

DEFINING CYBERWAR

[There is **no easily agreed-upon definition** of cyberwar]{.underline}.
Even within closely related literatures, [there exists an **ongoing
debate** over what constitutes cyberwar]{.underline}. Some, such as Rid,
who has written at length declaring there is no such thing as cyberwar,
question whether such a concept is a helpful lens for thinking the
present situation at all.1 The term cyberwar, in most invocations,
refers to the notion of cyberspace and the possibility of a war carried
out in this global networked space, wherein computer systems are taken
over to disrupt and surveil an enemy's communication and networked
infrastructure either as part of a "kinetic" war or as a form of
low-level conflict aimed at gaining geopolitical advantages. Though it
is important to follow authors, strategists, legal scholars, and others
wherever they happen to see "cyberwar" occurring, one particular
etymological meaning will guide this inquiry. [The prefix **cyber-**
refers to the term **cybernetics**]{.underline}. Cybernetics,
originating from the Greek kubernētēs ("steersman" or "governor"), is
[the science and study of systems]{.underline}, their structures,
regulation, emergent properties, and possibilities, spanning disciplines
from technology to biology to society. [By **explicitly
thinking**]{.underline} the **[cyber-]{.underline}** in cyberwar [as
referring to **systems**]{.underline}, [it will be **fruitful** to
understand cyberwar as a war against systems]{.underline}: computer
systems, state systems, systems of organization, and even systems of
meaning.

This etymological understanding of cyberwar closely mirrors some of the
earliest deployments of this term. One of the first unclassified uses of
the term cyberwar comes from a 1992 publication by Arnett.2 For him, the
term means the replacement of human operators with machines that decide
on targets, trajectories, movement, and so on---essentially the
culmination of a long history of the insertion of "intelligent machines"
into the arsenal of war fighting. That same year, Der Derian used the
term "in the sense of a technologically generated, televisually linked,
and strategically gamed form of violence."3 Arquilla and Ronfeldt
subsequently published a paper defining cyberwar as a tactical and
strategic movement whereby communication, information, and the
visibility of the battlespace become the central concern. They assert
that while information technology brings cyberwar to the fore, it is not
necessarily a technological phenomenon. In fact, the exemplary case of
cyberwar they recount is a thirteenth-century Mongol offensive against
Khwarizm, where the Mongols succeeded in defeating a significantly
larger army by cutting off communications and disrupting the control of
forces.

These definitions complement each other. Der Derian and Arnett's
definitions focus on carrying out a kinetic war through the cybernetic
organization of humans and technology, while Arquilla and Ronfeldt's
definition stresses disrupting all of the enemy's cybernetic systems
regardless of whether they are human, technological, or a combination.
We are faced, then, with something much more expansive than war in
cyberspace; rather, what these authors begin to explore in the early
1990s is an understanding of war in which one tries to construct and
defend systems of communicating, knowing, controlling, and, ultimately,
existing. Simultaneously, one attempts to disrupt, infiltrate, corrupt,
and destroy these same systems belonging to the enemy. Arquilla and
Ronfeldt state that such a strategy "may aim to confound people's
fundamental beliefs about the nature of their culture, society, and
government, partly to foment fear but perhaps mainly to disorient people
and unhinge their perceptions."4

Clearly this is not completely new. Belligerents have always attempted
to deceive their opponents and disrupt economies and governments.
Furthermore, war has often had as a central objective the destruction of
one critical system and the infiltration of another: the body and the
territory of the opponent. Despite this, we can outline three critical
factors that mark cyberwar as a historical shift. First, proponents of
cyberwar, such as Arquilla and Ronfeldt, stress that in cyberwar,
information and structures of knowing become central rather than
peripheral to conflict. They say that [cyberwar]{.underline} "[means
**disrupting** if not **destroying** the information and communications
systems]{.underline}, broadly defined to include even military culture,
[on which an adversary relies in order to know itself]{.underline}."5
Second, cyberwar attempts to disrupt not only the enemy's knowledge but
also the entire structure of knowledge. In short, [cyberwar invests
**epistemology itself** as a battlespace]{.underline}. Third, cyberwar
seeps outside of "war" proper. In calling into question modes of
knowing, cyberwar breaks down the limits of the time and space of war.

Thus the term cyberwar describes two distinct but related phenomena. On
one hand, it is a strategy for fighting war, and we will include
whatever is named cyberwar by strategists, legal theorists, authors, and
warriors. On the other hand, we will mean a historical shift---in a
sense, a global cyberwar that marks a tendency whereby the critical
element in war becomes the flow of information and the fortification and
disruption of systems. In making this shift, [cyberwar has opened an
**epistemological** and **cybernetic battlespace** wherein notions of
war]{.underline}, [enmity]{.underline}, [and knowing become **directly
contestable**]{.underline}. While these concepts have always been
unstable and problematic, cyberwar seizes them as systems of direct
military intervention, [turning what was once a question for
**philosophers** into a domain of the **global
battlespace**]{.underline}. In its most abstract sense,
[cyberwar]{.underline} has become an event that calls everything
including itself into question at the moment it arrives. It [is the
historical possibility that **all systems may break
down**]{.underline}---or, in their military occupation, be caused to
break down---but it is also possible that cyberwar may undermine itself
before anything actually "happens." Cyberwar as historical event marks a
moment of radical militarized unknowability.

A COMPROMISED HISTORY

[Many discussions of cyberwar]{.underline}, be they historical,
strategic, or legal, [begin not with]{.underline} the earliest
[**examples** or **contemporary attacks** but]{.underline} rather [with
a **future catastrophe** that demonstrates the danger of our
overreliance on]{.underline} vast, connected, yet [vulnerable
systems]{.underline}. These catastrophes normally start with a nonstate
actor or a "rogue" state hacking into key networks, destroying critical
infrastructure in the United States or multiple European countries.
Airplanes crash into each other, trains derail, communication channels
shut down, and electrical systems are disabled. Not only are these
systems forced to shut down but they are hijacked and made to spin out
of control, sometimes destroying themselves so completely that they
would take months to return to normal usage. [These **imagined
scenarios** often place the reader at the time immediately following the
catastrophe]{.underline}. At this point in time, one can survey the
wreckage of our technological hubris before the aftermath begins in
earnest. It is the moment when the full scale of a possible collapse is
revealed but not yet realized.6

Where a historical account begins in the past, it often starts with a
CIA attempt to secretly destroy a Soviet gas pipeline.7 According to
Thomas Reed, a National Security Council staffer, in 1982, the CIA was
able to insert an intentionally faulty piece of code into a pump that
the Soviet Union obtained from a Canadian company. According to Reed's
account, the pump was installed in the Trans-Siberian gas pipeline;
varying pump speeds and valve settings produced extreme pressures that
caused an explosion large enough to be detected by U.S. satellites. The
secret introduction of a so-called logic bomb---a somewhat antiquated
term for a malicious piece of code inserted into software---has been
touted by a number of commentators as one of the earliest examples of
cyberwar.

Although Reed, who made this story public for the first time in a 2004
book, never referred to this attack as cyberwar, this story has become
something of an origin myth for those who write about cyberwar more
generally.8 The event prefigures a number of issues that arise again and
again in the myriad discourses surrounding cyberwar. Most important, it
becomes clear how vulnerable complex systems of computation have become.
These systems aggregate code written across the globe and parts
manufactured outside the purview of their owners into complex networks
that belie attempts to control them. Computation is exposed to the
exterior places in which it is produced.

Furthermore, even if unintentionally, the use of this event as the first
in a series of international cyberattacks offers an answer to a question
that is often asked of theorists of cyberwar: how can such an event lay
claim to being "war"? Is this merely sabotage? Placing the origin in the
Cold War responds to those critics of cyberwar hype who believe it is
nothing more than a collection of high-tech tools in service of the
ancient techniques of spying, deception, and sabotage. For [the Cold War
proved that wars **need not be explosive** and could consist of
**decades** of low-level conflict]{.underline}. As Virilio says of [the
threat posed by **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, "the weapon's serious
danger [is not that it could **explode tomorrow**]{.underline}. . . [but
that for **thirty years** it has been **destroying
society**]{.underline}."9 [The bomb's destructive power has been **felt
directly** through its threat]{.underline}. Likewise, as can be seen in
the futuristic scenarios described earlier, [cyberwar **seems always to
threaten catastrophe**]{.underline}. Placing [cyberwar]{.underline}'s
origins in the Cold War [suggests the possibility of a **nonwar** that
is **as destructive as a kinetic war**]{.underline}. The second half of
the twentieth century has demonstrated that [even in the **absence** of
a hot war]{.underline}, [conflict can **destroy governments** and
**societies**]{.underline}.

Furthermore, at least for those theorists and strategists of cyberwar in
the United States, this origin story contextualizes contemporary
cyberwar discourses in another way. Several military and political
commentators writing about cyberwar as a strategic area of study were
the same theorists who worked on nuclear deterrence strategy in the
latter part of the Cold War. A number of authors---many of whom work for
the RAND Corporation, a think tank that was created in 1948 to provide
research and analysis to the U.S. military---even attempt to employ
strategies learned from nuclear deterrence research to mitigate military
hacking and offensive use of global networks.10 Tying the origin of
cyberwar to Cold War global strategic thinking offers an opportunity for
those making the transition from strategizing in a bipolar world defined
by nuclear weapons to a multipolar, interconnected global economy.

While the Siberian pipeline attack's similarity to contemporary issues
surrounding cyberwar is noteworthy, the most striking aspect of the
whole affair is that it possibly never happened. Following the release
of Reed's book, an ex-KGB officer with direct knowledge of the region at
the time disputes Reed's account. He acknowledged there was an explosion
but claims it was at a different, smaller pipeline and was caused by
specific construction mistakes, not by faulty equipment.11 Moreover, no
known media reports from the time confirm an explosion, which Reed
claims was the size of a small nuclear blast. Other than Reed's account,
no other documentation has been found, and the CIA has never confirmed
the event.12

The origins of cyberwar in this event are seemingly impossible to
verify. Pipeline explosions were common at the time, and there would
have been no way for the CIA to know for certain if it was caused by
their purposefully faulty equipment or accidently faulty Soviet
equipment. Given our current evidence, the event is completely
unknowable. Moreover, even if there was an explosion, it is impossible
to verify if it was the logic bomb or a mechanical failure. Depending on
one's perspective, either the fake event or fake refutations seep into
the historical record like a computer virus corrupting the system's
memory.

Thus, in a largely unrecognized way, this event is archetypal for
cyberwar. Cyberwar and [**cybersecurity** weave a **complicated
relationship** between the knowable and the unknowable]{.underline}.
[Our networked world has become **so complex** in sheer technical terms
that the system as a whole **cannot be known** from the
outside]{.underline}. [Mapping even just the public Web has become a
scholarly pursuit in its own right]{.underline}. Computers and networks
represent [information]{.underline} as tiny bits on a magnetic disk or
pulses of light across a cable that, owing to their size, speed, and
complexity, [are on their own **essentially meaningless** and
**impenetrable** to human observers]{.underline}. [One always interacts
with **abstractions** and **complex representations** of]{.underline}
the [material reality]{.underline} of computing. Cyberwar, in attacking
these systems, is always on the verge of being meaningless itself.
Moreover, [in attacking systems of knowing that guarantee
information]{.underline}, [a successful attack impairs even our ability
to know if something has happened]{.underline}. Cyberwar is fought
precisely in this space between the possible catastrophe and the
possibility of nothing happening at all.

The event itself is ambiguous and our public historical record is
already compromised. It could of course be argued that all history is
ambiguous, constructed, and selective. [What is **unique**
in]{.underline} the case of [cyberwar is that the **whole structure** of
knowing and observing is opened as a site of **direct military
intervention**]{.underline}. It is not only a question of interpretation
and selective archives. [The entire archive and our ability to
comprehend the archive may be attacked at any moment]{.underline}. In a
sense, we are dealing with a limit case of historical
unknowability---not just ambiguity but a military attack on the data of
history itself. Now, even if the victors write history, it may no longer
be written from data they control.

Thus [an **effective understanding** of cyberwar will only be possible
by **not prematurely deciding** in favor of an event **happening** or
**not happening**]{.underline}. [Cyberwar operates]{.underline} both as
a strategy and as a mediatized cultural phenomenon directly [in the
space **between** happening and not happening]{.underline}. [It
**succeeds**]{.underline} as a military strategy [by **never succeeding
too much**]{.underline}. [It always **seems** to be leading us to the
verge of **catastrophe** and at the same time to an **interminable
boredom** where nothing will ever actually happen]{.underline}. Cyberwar
could easily be dismissed as not really being war or violent, but [what
is **so virulent** and **dangerous** about cyberwar is its ability to
**atomize** and **distribute** warfare into everyday life]{.underline}.
[Cyberwar succeeds **so much more effectively** for being either
**overhyped** or **dismissed**]{.underline}. [[Ultimately]{.underline},
[we must **resist** deciding in favor of **catastrophe** or
**boredom**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[for in doing
so]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the **entirety** of cyberwar will **certainly
escape us**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we
must attempt to **interrogate the history** and **discourses** of
cyberwar]{.underline}]{.mark} by following its vacillations between
these two poles [[as it **hides** in the theoretical space between war
and nonwar]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Our historical interrogation begins relatively recently, on April 26, 2007. Not a very important date by American standards, but one remembered by many Estonians as the "Bronze Night." Estonia decided to move the Bronze Soldier, a Soviet memorial statue, out of Tallinn, its capital, provoking violent pro-Russian protests. Soon after, the extremely Internet-reliant Estonia was devastated by a DDoS cyberattack of Russian origins, isolating the country and shutting its economy down for two weeks.

#### The Bronze Night is now widely considered the world's first cyberwar. Though the Russian government has denied official responsibility, NATO saw the attack on its vulnerable member as not just a threat, but the harbinger of a [new era of war]{.underline} which it was [woefully unprepared for]{.underline}. In response, Estonia led the alliance in establishing its Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence, as well as a comprehensive overview of the laws of cyberwarfare---the Tallinn Manual---and, gradually, the small country became the [epicenter]{.underline} of NATO's cybersecurity efforts.

#### NATO missed the real significance of the Bronze Night, which was not simply that it was [vulnerable]{.underline} to a new form of warfare, but that it was [fundamentally outdated]{.underline} in the face of the cybernetic transformation of the planet, as it was founded on the relevance of geopolitical factors like nation-states and physical boundaries like the "North Atlantic" which hold [no sway]{.underline} in the digital era. NATO did get one thing right, though: [there's no going back]{.underline}.

and Time of Cyberwar," *Deconstruction Machines: Writing in the Age of
Cyberwar*, Chapter 1, 38-43, dml)

While Moonlight Maze was declared a cyberwar by a few individuals, [a
row between Russia and Estonia in 2007]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
often mentioned as [one of the **earliest all-out
cyberwars**]{.underline}.17 On April 26 of that year, [Estonia moved the
**Bronze Soldier**]{.underline}, a memorial to Soviet soldiers killed
during World War II, [from]{.underline} the center of the Estonian
capital **[Tallinn]{.underline}** to a cemetery on the outskirts of
town. [Russians]{.underline} within both Estonia and Russia
**[protested]{.underline}**. [**Riots** broke out]{.underline} in
Tallinn, killing one and injuring more than a hundred people.18 In
response, the Russian parliament called for the resignation of the
Estonian government and stopped rail service from St. Petersburg, train
shipments of oil through Estonia, and even heavy vehicles from crossing
a major bridge from Russia into Estonia.19

At the same time, [a host of computer-based services in Estonia were hit
with a]{.underline} distributed denial-of-service
(**[DDoS]{.underline}**) [attack]{.underline}. A DDoS attack involves
overwhelming a server with traffic such that it is no longer able to
respond to legitimate requests. It is relatively easy to automatically
block computers that are sending inordinate numbers of requests to a
server, so most DDoS attacks must be distributed across a large number
of machines to succeed. This is achieved either by maliciously taking
over machines to create what is called a botnet, some of which have
involved tens of millions of computers, or by convincing people to
voluntarily lend their machines for the purpose of an attack. These
voluntary or commandeered machines are then turned against servers to
overrun them with requests and disable them. DDoS attacks thus do not
require breaking into a machine and do not compromise private data that
may reside on the server; rather, they disable the server for as long as
the botnet can continue sending requests.

In Estonia, [these attacks targeted government websites and critical
businesses]{.underline} such as banks and newspapers, [shutting down
ATMs and]{.underline} some means of [communication]{.underline} within
the country. [These attacks were **especially symbolic**
because]{.underline}, at the time, [Estonia was one of the **most
well-connected countries** in Europe]{.underline}, [with **more than 90
percent** of bank transactions completed online]{.underline}. [The
country even allowed Internet voting]{.underline} by this point. Seven
years prior, in 2000, the Estonian parliament declared Internet access a
human right.20 [Estonia was ultimately unable to counter the attacks and
responded by **shutting off Internet connections** to other
countries]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} allowed services to resume
within the country but [**prevented access** to those outside the
country]{.underline}. The attacks finally slowed down two weeks later.
The Russian government denied any responsibility, and a number of
security specialists have speculated that the attacks would have likely
been more destructive if there had been direct government or military
involvement, but there were extensive calls on Russian Internet for
participation and instructions for how to join the attacks against
Estonian institutions.21

The attacks on Estonia were carried out with a clear intent to disrupt
the country in response to moving the Bronze Soldier, but beyond that
and some technical details of the attack, little is discernable. The
underlying purpose and the actors involved remain largely unknown, as
Russia has refused any cooperation with Estonian law enforcement in
finding and apprehending those responsible, despite a treaty
guaranteeing mutual legal assistance. While it seems unlikely that the
Russian government or military directly organized the specifics of the
attacks, they have offered it their tacit approval by refusing to assist
in any investigations. Thus [the attacks]{.underline} against Estonia
[appear]{.underline} most likely [to have been a]{.underline}
"**[war]{.underline}**" carried out by patriotic hackers [not
**officially** affiliated with the military]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} perhaps [with **military support**]{.underline}, and
clearly [**outside** the bounds and means of traditional kinetic
warfare]{.underline}.22 As much as it is possible to discuss the purpose
of these attacks that were carried out by a variety of unidentified
individuals, [the attacks were aimed directly at **disconnecting**
Estonia from the global Internet and economy]{.underline}. In addition
to the DDoS attacks, the other provocations all served to disconnect
Estonia. Cutting rail and heavy truck connections to Estonia act in this
light as physical denial-of-service attacks. To return to Castells's
point mentioned earlier, [exclusion from global networks is]{.underline}
perhaps now [one of the **gravest threats** that could be wrought upon a
nation]{.underline}. A denial-ofservice attack, in both its digital and
physical forms, relegates the target to the space of place, severing its
connections to global networks. While cyberwar functions through a
variety of modes, it seems one goal that is often invoked is to
disconnect one's enemies from global spaces of flow.

All [these attacks function]{.underline} at the same time [to allow a
level of **plausible deniability**]{.underline}. The physical
infrastructure disruptions were claimed to be due to lack of passengers,
repairs, and safety concerns rather than retribution. The cyberattacks
were attributable to unknown patriotic hackers rather than a government
or military group that could be held accountable. [While in some
cases]{.underline} it may be that [governments and militaries **truly**
were not involved]{.underline}, [in the cases in which they **were**
and]{.underline} attempt to [deny their involvement]{.underline}, it is
likely in many cases that [this is due to fear of being **cut off** from
global networks themselves]{.underline}. Ene [Ergma]{.underline}, [the
speaker of the Estonian parliament]{.underline} at the time,
[claimed]{.underline} in an interview that "[attacking us is one way of
**checking NATO's defenses**]{.underline}. [They could **examine the
alliance's readiness** under the cover of the statue
protest]{.underline}."23 [While Estonia did not invoke **Article
5**]{.underline} of the NATO treaty, which outlines countries'
responsibility of mutual defense, [NATO responded by creating
the]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}** Cooperative
**[Cyber]{.underline}** Defence **[Centre]{.underline}** of Excellence
in Estonia's capital.24 The creation of the Centre of Excellence served
[to **reassert Estonia's position** in a network of mutual
defense]{.underline}, from which it was believed that Russia was
attempting to sever Estonia. Thus this conflict can be read as a series
of actions aimed at severing and reasserting Estonia's connection to
global flows of information, capital, people, military assistance, and
goods.

[It is]{.underline} also [**clear** from these attacks that we are
witnessing a **significant blurring** of the distinction between
civilian]{.underline}, [military]{.underline}, [and political
spheres]{.underline}. Just over a year after the Estonian crisis, when
Russia entered a kinetic war with Georgia over South Ossetia, a wave of
cyberattacks against Georgian targets followed Russian physical attacks.
Like the Estonian attacks, the degree of Russian involvement was largely
indeterminable. These attacks followed a similar logic of attempting to
disconnect Georgia from global networks and also to assert the
legitimacy of the Russian cause, perhaps with the hope of winning the
global media's blessing and thus support for maintaining global
connections.25 In both these conflicts, it is evident that [cyberwar
does not merely seize upon an increasingly connected world but rather
**intervenes directly** in global space itself to attempt to
define]{.underline}, [create]{.underline}, [and undermine spaces of
connection and disconnection]{.underline}. The increasing military and
state interest in cyberwar is, then, not simply a result of the rise of
global networks but rather an active force that both promotes and
attacks such connections. Although [the attacks in Estonia]{.underline}
and Georgia were in response to geopolitical (and networked) change,
they [sought actively to **reshape**]{.underline} a set of
[interconnected networks]{.underline} and spaces.

OPERATION ORCHARD AS MICROSCOPIC WAR

A few months after the attacks against Estonia, on September 6, 2007,
Israeli fighter jets attacked a supposed nuclear installation in Syria.
The jets entered Syrian air space, destroyed the site, and returned
without being fired upon. Despite the two countries technically being at
war since 1948, both downplayed the event, which is now known as
Operation Orchard.26 One of the most noteworthy elements of the attack
was that a state-of-the-art radar system completely failed to detect the
Israeli airplanes. Although it is unclear why the radar system failed, a
number of commentators have suggested that the most likely cause was an
advanced electronic attack on the system. Some sources even suggested it
was possible that the computer chips that ran the radar system were
fabricated with a "back door" so that they could be forced to
malfunction.27

Even if this was not the case in the Israeli attack on Syria, chips
being compromised during their production is becoming a growing military
concern. The U.S. military has been working to create verified
production facilities within the United States, but the growing number
of commercial chips used in military equipment has complicated these
efforts. There have been attempts to create systems to verify chips
after production, but with current technology, it is nearly impossible
to guard against a back door that is only triggered under specific
conditions.28

[There arises in cybersecurity a **numbers game** that]{.underline}
generally [favors attackers over defenders]{.underline}. For instance,
microchips have become so complicated that a few transistors arranged in
such a way that they can be activated for some malicious purpose are
almost impossible to detect in chips now made of billions of
transistors.29 Furthermore, even if it were possible to check chips for
insecurities, it would be possible to limit the number of compromised
chips to a small number in a production run, requiring that nearly every
chip be checked to guarantee security (and one would, of course, have to
guarantee that the system that checked the chips had not been
compromised itself).

Two important phenomena emerge from the insecurity of supply chains in a
digital and globalized world. First, [the space and time of war spread
**outside war itself**]{.underline} in an even more insidious way than
we saw previously. [Cyberwar]{.underline}, especially as it includes
physical points of intrusion into chips, [requires]{.underline}, in a
sense, [that the war start **before** the war]{.underline}. [The trap
must be laid **long before** a conflict breaks out]{.underline}. The
[war]{.underline} then [extends along the **entire supply
chain**]{.underline}. [Any]{.underline} place that
[weapons]{.underline}, [infrastructure]{.underline}, [or]{.underline}
any [systems]{.underline} containing chips are designed, assembled, and
stored [becomes a **potential battle space** in a future
conflict]{.underline}. Though sabotage has always been a threat for
warring parties, the globalization and commercialization of the computer
chip market mean that [a country may end up fighting the very country
that designed and manufactured the majority of its computing
power]{.underline}. Prior to the growth of computerbased weapons, it may
have been possible to sell low-quality armaments or steel to a potential
future enemy, but hiding such built-in failures was difficult. Now the
situation is inverted, and the work required to find faults and back
doors in chips is substantially greater than the work involved in
creating and hiding them. It is, then, not only that a nation or group
can be disconnected from global flows but also that these global flows
can be turned against an adversary, quickly turning supply chains and
capital flows into potential threats.

Second, new, more complicated gaps open between knowing and seeing. The
military reliance on more and more complicated technology has, over the
course of the past century or so, pushed military operations beyond the
field of sight. With the introduction of computer chips, and especially
chips that could be attacked or sabotaged, the battle space now includes
the microscopic. Moreover, technologies like radar and other advanced
warning systems now rely exclusively on these technologies, and thus
attacks that are imperceptible and microscopic can disrupt one's ability
to see on a macroscopic level. This is precisely what is believed to
have happened in Syria. As Richard Clarke said of the attacks, "the view
seen by the Syrians bore no relation to the reality that their eastern
skies had become an Israeli Air Force bombing range. Syrian air defense
missiles could not have been fired because there had been no targets in
the system for them to seek out."30 [While war can now happen at **every
level** from the microscopic to the global]{.underline}, [defeat on one
level **easily spills over** to all the others]{.underline}. [Not only
does war expand into cyberspace as a new domain of battle but other
domains with their own geographies]{.underline}---including the
macroscopic geographies of supply chains and the internal microscopic
geographies of chips themselves---[become realms of war and localized
battle spaces]{.underline}.

[War becomes **rhizomatic** and spreads out in **all
directions**]{.underline}, [including downward to the microscopic and
imperceptible]{.underline}. Supply chains have always been important to
war efforts, but what has changed is both the depth and breadth of
global supply chains. Following World War II, the European Coal and
Steel Community was created with the express purpose of tying French and
German markets together to prevent another war, but this relied on the
products of coal and steel being perceptible and war being a macroscopic
phenomenon.31 Now [supply chains are intertwined on an
**imperceptible**]{.underline}, **[molecular level]{.underline}**,
[making their interdependency a potential source of
**instability**]{.underline} rather than stability.

While **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}** harness the microscopic power of
atoms to create unprecedented levels of destruction, they [are
**anathema** to any type of precision]{.underline}, [rendering them
**useless** in any conflict short of all-out warfare]{.underline}.
[Cyberweapons act to **counter** this lack of precision]{.underline}.
Instead of releasing the maximum power from atoms, bits are manipulated,
corrupted, and destroyed with exacting precision. [Not only are precise
sites and types of machines selected]{.underline} for destruction [but
levels of destruction are dialed in to precisely determine the possible
responses]{.underline}. [This is **not** to say that these political
calculations are **always**]{.underline}, [or even
**often**]{.underline}, [done **well** or to the benefit of
anyone]{.underline}. [Nor is it to say that what is precisely chosen and
destroyed will not create results that will **spiral out of
control**]{.underline}. Still, interventions are weighed and aimed at
specific nodal sites in global networks, moving these calculations away
from geopolitics toward a nodal politics.32 This networked political
calculus does not replace the geographic but rather embeds geopolitics
in what Virilio calls "metageophysics."33 Ultimately, [war]{.underline}
in this new nodal space [spreads out in **every perceptible** and
**imperceptible direction**]{.underline}, [intertwining with the
**civilian** and the **everyday**]{.underline}. It follows the supply
chains of advanced industrial nations all over the world, [increasing
the possibility that an imperceptible war could be fought **unbeknownst
to all observers**]{.underline}. War then atomizes and moves along these
multiple geographies, both spatial and aspatial, exploiting global flows
and seeking infinitesimal advantages.

#### This transformation is occurring at a level [beyond]{.underline} material infrastructures or international governance: digital technology has transformed [life]{.underline}, [communication]{.underline}, and the [mind itself]{.underline}. The [cybernetic episteme]{.underline}---the [global system of understanding]{.underline} based on quantification and data analysis---is upon us. It weighs [thirty trillion tons]{.underline}, it's [alienating]{.underline} friends and families, and it will [destroy the planet]{.underline}.

**Emmelhainz, 21**---independent researcher and writer who has lectured
and taught at an array of international institutions (Irmgard,

Disappearance of Everything on Earth," e-flux #122, November 2021, dml)

[Life and society worldwide have been **transformed** by digital
technology]{.underline}, [including the **fabrics** of emotional
relationships]{.underline}. [Many believed the internet would be
the]{.underline} largest ungoverned [space]{.underline} in the world
[with **unlimited**]{.underline} emancipatory
**[potential]{.underline}**, and trusted Big Tech to make the world a
better place. [Yet power and capitalism filled that space
with]{.underline} surveillance systems, the production of private
capital, the monetization of data, and the **[control]{.underline}** of
human lives. Social media now shape daily life and many have lost faith
in the possibility of a shared consensus reality. We are living in a
scenario similar to one imagined by Black Mirror: our belief in digital
communication and social media creates narcissistic personalities,
selves dissociated and dislocated from their reflections online. Digital
communication offers an opaque mirror that delivers egos without bodies,
eliding alterity.

The collapse of reality, however, is not an unintended consequence of
advancements in, for instance, artificial intelligence: it was the
long-term objective of many technologists, who sought to create machines
capable of transforming human consciousness (like drugs do).
[Communication has become a site for the **extraction of**]{.underline}
surplus **[value]{.underline}**, and images operate as both commodities
and dispositives for this extraction. Moreover, [data mediates our
**cognition**]{.underline}, that is to say, the way in which we exist
and perceive the world and others. The image---and the [unlimited
communication]{.underline} promised by constant imagery---[have
**ceased** to have emancipatory potential]{.underline}. [Images place a
veil over a world in which the **isolated living dead**]{.underline},
[thirsty for stimulation and dopamine]{.underline}, [give and collect
likes]{.underline} on social media. Platform users exist according to
the Silicon Valley utopian ideal of life's complete virtualization.

The internet, moreover, has radically changed the political
communications game and must be considered a complex propaganda
apparatus. Although a single Tweet can destroy someone's career, and
fake news can start a real news cycle, [meaning is **subordinate** to
the circulation of vacuous content]{.underline}. The capitalist capture
of data for profit does not rely on policing content; [the production of
capital **only** relies on the **constant exchange** and **circulation**
of information]{.underline}. We don't yet know the full extent of the
manipulation of companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon in the
last two elections in the US or in other elections around the world. But
it is undeniable that digital platforms are actively censoring content
in the interests of particular political actors. For instance: in
October 2020, Zoom canceled a meeting hosting Palestinian human rights
activist Leila Khaled; a month before, Facebook and Twitter censored
information detrimental to Joseph Biden's presidential campaign. The
same two companies intervened and shut down pro-Trump accounts in 2020,
even Donald Trump's own Facebook and Twitter accounts.

After the attempted coup at the US capitol on January 6, 2020,
Facebook's recently instituted oversight board ruled that Trump had
created "an environment where a serious risk of violence was possible."
In this light, it seems likely that he will continue to be banned from
the platform. According to journalist Shoshana Zuboff, however, this is
insufficient, given that the oversight board's decision (whose work is
supported by a \$130 million endowment from Facebook) follows years of
inaction by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who indulged and appeased Trump while
entrenching what Zuboff calls "[surveillance capitalism]{.underline}." A
liberal might think that shutting up Trump and helping Biden is not bad,
as they are actions that seemingly advance the interests of the
Democratic Party. What is at stake here, however, is not whether the
platforms take a "good" or "bad" stance on a particular issue; the
problem [is]{.underline} that they have immense unchecked power and can
act as they please. Platforms are [allowed to **secretly extract**
behavioral data]{.underline} from users, whether or not users are aware,
transforming the information into targeted ads, [destroying
privacy]{.underline}, [changing human experience into data]{.underline},
[altering elections]{.underline}, [and **reshaping human
civilization**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} structure [can be
termed]{.underline} [the]{.underline} "**[cybernetic
episteme]{.underline}**," [and the new form of control]{.underline},
which goes beyond the previous regime of biopower, can be termed
"**[neuropower]{.underline}**."

According to its Greek etymology, [an]{.underline}
"**[episteme]{.underline}**" [is a **system of
understanding**]{.underline}. In The Order of Things, Michel Foucault
uses the term "épistemè" to mean the nontemporal or a priori knowledge
that grounds what is taken as truth in a given moment. Several epistemes
coexist at a given time, as they constitute parts of various systems of
power and knowledge. [The **cybernetic episteme**]{.underline}, as
defined by the collective Tiqqun some twenty years ago, [describes our
relationship to technology and machines]{.underline} (which are
inseparable from the workings of capitalism). The cybernetic episteme is
[based on the modern tenet of **progress** and **human-led
transcendence**]{.underline} achieved [through science and
technology]{.underline}.

Under neuropower, the sensible gives way to cognitive pathologies. These
pathologies depend on the consumption of content rather than the sharing
of meaning. As Thomas Metzinger explains, [the internet has become an
**integral part** of how we model ourselves]{.underline}, as we use it
for external memory storage, as a cognitive prosthesis, and for
emotional self-regulation. [This has **radically changed** the structure
of conscious experience]{.underline}, [creating]{.underline} a new form
of waking consciousness that resembles "a mixture of dreaming, dementia,
intoxication, and infantilization." Other effects of neuropower are
humans' growing invisibility to each other and [a **paroxysmal racism**
that]{.underline} infiltrates power, technology, culture, language, and
work. For Franco "Bifo" Berardi, racism has become a "virus" that
[exacerbates]{.underline} fear---above all, [the **fear of
extinction**]{.underline}, [which seems to have become one of the
**motors behind white supremacy**]{.underline} in the world. Dissociated
from our environment, alienated from each other, we are oblivious to the
challenges that are being posed to humanity by the Capitalocene.

[A **complex form of authoritarianism** is emerging]{.underline}, linked
to digital platforms owned by the powerful CEOs who make up the
notorious "Silicon Six." Under the new authoritarianism, [populations
are no longer **commanded**]{.underline}: [they are **asked to
participate**]{.underline}, and in [this **simulation** of
involvement]{.underline}, the "ideology of connection"
**[replaces]{.underline}** the idea of [social relations]{.underline},
[**neutralizing** democratic demands]{.underline} from users to have
control over their own lives, rights, and data. In this way, [people are
made passive]{.underline}. Cédric Durand explains the difference between
the original conception of the World Wide Web and the subsequent
development of closed platforms. The WWW began as a decentralized
architecture in which a generic transaction protocol (http) and a
uniform identification format (URI/URL) generated a space of flat
content. In this space, human and nonhuman agents could have access to
information without any third-party mediation. In contrast, closed
platforms use application programming interfaces, or APIs, to mediate
interaction, giving way to data loops in which interactions are more
dense. The technical object that sustains this hierarchical architecture
is the API, each of which is owned by a platform. On the one hand, big
platforms, by way of APIs, offer apps that incorporate basic and
indispensable data for users. On the other, platforms have access to the
additional information generated by the API, such as user activity and
buying habits. As the ecosystem grows in complexity, the platform is
able to accumulate more and more data. We become more densely connected
with each other and with the platforms every day, as our lives get more
and more tied to the cloud. [Our dependency on platforms provides the
ground for **technofeudalism**]{.underline}. Historically, feudalism was
characterized by a fundamental inequality that enabled the direct
exploitation of peasants by lords. The lord was both the manager and
master not only of the process of production, but of the entire process
of social life. In today's technofeudalism, [platform owners are the
digital lords and users are the serfs]{.underline}. Rather than
commodity production, these platforms are geared towards accumulation
through rent, debt, and the privatization of the basic infrastructure
that sustains our lives. [What is at stake is **no longer**]{.underline}
"true" or "fake" [**information** but the **cybernetic episteme** upon
which our lives and subjectivities have been built]{.underline}.

The cybernetic episteme is premised upon modernity's enclosure of
experience. In modern epistemology, which is the precondition of the
cybernetic episteme, [the self is **externalized** and experienced at a
**remove** from the body]{.underline}. Perception is centered on the
brain and eyes instead of the whole body, separating sensation from
reason. The self's relationship with the world is mediated through
mirrors, camera lenses, the canvas, the microscope, and mathematical
models. [The cybernetic episteme]{.underline}, moreover, [is
**inextricable from colonialism**]{.underline}, [which entails
**dispossession**]{.underline}, **[dislocation]{.underline}**,
**[dissociation]{.underline}**, [and **appropriation**]{.underline}.
Ariella Azoulay has called the logic underpinning these processes "the
shutter"; [this logic]{.underline} is materialized in photographic
technology that separates humans from objects, self from the world, and
people from their lands. The shutter [is the **principle of
imperialism** by which campaigns of plunder have left people both
**worldless** and **objectless**]{.underline}. For Azoulay, the logic of
the shutter was invented centuries before photography gave it a
technological apparatus, and it enabled the dispossession of non-Western
peoples in tandem with the accumulation of visual and material wealth in
archives and museums in the West.

[The cybernetic episteme]{.underline} is likewise conceptually
constituted by this shutter, since it [relies on
**capturing**]{.underline}, **[naming]{.underline}**,
**[moving]{.underline}**, [and **archiving** subjects]{.underline}---[as
does imperialism]{.underline}. In [this]{.underline} regard, the
cybernetic episteme [**naturalizes** the mediation of the
self]{.underline}; [it creates not only the condition of **detachment**
from the world]{.underline}, [but allows the **appropriation** of the
cultures of others]{.underline}, [as well as the **dissolution** of
collective being]{.underline}. The shutter is akin to Heidegger's
Gestell or "representation," which goes hand in hand with Eurocentrism
and Anthropocentrism. The Gestell and the shutter both imply that the
world and experience have become representation, through an aesthetic
order in which what is produced as artifice becomes the reality of
experience.

In a 2017 Facebook promo video for a new virtual reality technology,
Mark Zuckerberg and his colleague Rachel Frank tele-transported
themselves to Puerto Rico after a devastating flood. They intended to
showcase the potential of the new technology, but instead revealed its
inherent violence. The ability to transport oneself to faraway places
"as if" one's body were present gives the illusion that one we can make
a difference in the world through technology. Another example, in a
different register of colonial modernity is that way Western museums
allow visitors to \"transport\" themselves by observing objects looted
from elsewhere, like the Pergamon Museum in Berlin where museumgoers can
roam around the Ishtar Gate, which has been on display in the museum
since 1930. In a section of Ariella Azoulay's video Undocumented:
Unlearning Imperial Plunder (2020), she films actual visitors to the
Pergamon while noting that dislocation is the essence of (imperial)
modernity. The VR museum visitor is at the center of a world, but they
are not really there (an effect similar to the dispositive of
perspective in painting). For globalized Western culture, the ground for
vision, enlightenment, culture, and even social change is the
dislocation and disappearance of bodies.

Disembodiment and dislocation are also fundamental epistemological
premises of transhumanist Silicon Valley ideology. In this ideology, the
teleology of secular modern individualism culminates in the uploading of
a person's mind to a new biological, artificial, or
biological-artificial body. The utopian goal of expanding and preserving
human consciousness is physically and spiritually achieved.
Transhumanism is the dream of enhancing the human body through
technology, and ultimately escaping human suffering by transcending the
"errors" of death and aging.

Posthumanism takes things a step further: its goal is to immortalize
consciousness by uploading it to a robotic or synthetic body.
Posthumanism does away with the biological dimension of the self,
fundamentally altering what it means to be "human." In both trans- and
posthumanism, technology promises to give us the divine attributes of
omnipresence, omnipotence, and omniscience, making humans into "pure
consciousness," achieving a kind of individual and secular
transcendence. In the first episode of the British TV series Years and
Years (2019), Bethany, an adolescent whose face is hidden behind a 3D
emoji mask, announces to her parents that she is "transhuman." She
declares: "I don't want to be flesh. I want to escape this thing and
become digital, I want to live forever as information." Eventually
Bethany becomes a hero with transhuman superpowers: her mechanized eyes
and brain, which are connected to all the data in the world, allow her
to make visible the horrors that the British government have perpetrated
in a refugee camp. This techno-utopian narrative implies a democratic
ideology, insofar as one political goal of democracy is to make visible
the ordeals of oppressed minorities---in this case through virtual
disembodiment.

In contrast to this techno-utopian narrative, science
fiction---especially cyberpunk literature--- generally portrays
transhumanism as a nightmarish apocalyptic scenario of social control
and individual subjection. Several episodes of Black Mirror do this, for
example. But what Black Mirror and Years and Years have in common is
that technological advances and the increasing symbiosis between humans
and machines are associated with political, economic, and social
instability. In reality, "mind uploading" has attracted millions of
dollars of investment from the billionaires of Silicon Valley and
beyond. In a mixture of engineering and enlightenment, consciousness is
now being hacked through biofeedback techniques, meditation practices,
and microdosing drugs. Many critics have observed that the utopian
ideology of transhumanism underpins the Valley's culture of "move fast,
break things, and make as much money as possible." Technologies aiming
to expand human consciousness are rooted in purely extractivist,
capitalist values. In this sense, cybernetics is a political project on
a planetary scale. As described by Tiqqun, cybernetics is a gigantic
"abstract machine" made up of binary machines deployed by empire, and a
form of political sovereignty that has merged with the capitalist
extractivist project.

2\.

In the pre-cybernetic era---that is to say, before the 1940s---machines
were intended to emulate humans; their actions resembled human behavior,
but ostensibly without intent or emotions. This is why Donna Haraway
describes pre-cybernetic machines as "haunted." They seemed animated by
ghosts, reminiscent of Walter Benjamin's automaton that was inhabited by
a hunchbacked dwarf. Machines were not self-moving, self-designing, or
autonomous. They could not achieve human dreams, only mock them. In
turn, humans related to machines by using or acting upon them: switching
them on or off, using them as tools to achieve an end. Today, the
relationship between human and machine is based on internal, mutual
communication in a feedback loop. Early machines were led; today,
machines lead us. This does not mean that machines have simply become
humanized through the proliferation of androids. Rather, [humans have
**surrendered consciousness** to AI]{.underline}, [becoming **obedient**
and **predictable**]{.underline}. In the twenty-first century, machines
have blurred the distinction between the artificial and human mind, not
only because machines can imitate human functions, but because [humans
have become **increasingly passive**]{.underline}, [since we are now
subject to **neuropower**]{.underline}.

Within the cybernetic episteme, [it is no longer enough to talk about
a]{.underline} "**[control society]{.underline}**"; [we must talk
instead about a composite of **interlinked forms of
oppression**]{.underline} (exploitation, alienation, and domination),
[in tandem with]{.underline} extreme securitarianism. Another way to see
the cybernetic episteme is as [the reconceptualization of social worlds
into **information-processing systems**]{.underline}. Practices of
computation are used to produce new organizational and infrastructural
apparatuses, which in turn create value and profit by exploiting and
disposing of human life. [Social worlds are **subsumed** into
technologies]{.underline} through techniques such as statistical
forecasting and data modeling.

The cybernetic episteme stems from a world brought into being by
Europeans; this world began with the discovery of the "new world" and
the creation of empires and colonies (which coincided with the
scientific revolution). In this sense, [the cybernetic episteme is
**inseparable** from the **Western civilizing project** for the whole
world]{.underline}, which connected disparate places through
technologies like the telegraph and steam shipping, often powered by the
extraction of fossil fuels like coal. [This project has culminated
in]{.underline} globalization as [the **deregulation** and
**financialization** of world economies]{.underline}.

The Western civilization project, based on Enlightenment values
including equality, peaceful public life, access to modern science, the
rule of law, democracy, and technological progress, involved the
creation of infrastructure to unify nations and the world. [We can call
this]{.underline} infrastructure [the]{.underline}
"**[technosphere]{.underline}**." The technosphere comprises [not only
digital technology but all]{.underline} machines, factories, computers,
cars, buildings, railways, and mobility [infrastructure]{.underline}, as
well as systems of [food production]{.underline}, [resource
extraction]{.underline}, [and energy distribution]{.underline}. Today,
the infrastructure of the world---[the technosphere]{.underline}---[is
shaped by information]{.underline}, which means that the world we
inhabit is designed by data.

The technosphere is a supplement humans have created to help overcome
the limits of "human nature" insofar as humans cannot live independently
from structures geared towards sustaining life. [The technosphere has
promised to enable us to]{.underline} increase production and
reproduction with less human effort. Moreover, the technosphere is also
regarded as the main tool humans have to **[fight decay]{.underline}**,
**[entropy]{.underline}**, [and **death**]{.underline}, since it
comprises all the structures humans have built to keep themselves alive
on the planet. [The total mass of the technosphere amounts
to]{.underline} fifty kilos for every square meter of earth's
surface---a total of **[thirty trillion tons]{.underline}**, [which
coexists with the **diminishing hydrosphere**]{.underline} (water, the
frozen polar regions) [and the **biosphere**]{.underline} (all of
earth's living organisms). [The ultimate price]{.underline} of the
technosphere [is **global warming** and **environmental
devastation**]{.underline}. Like humans, the technosphere needs external
energy input, which is not sustainable as long as it comes from fossil
fuels that will eventually be depleted.

From this standpoint, the cybernetic episteme represents the gradual
merging of human activity into the activity of what we have built and
surrounded ourselves with. Much of this built environment is invisible.
Infrastructure and data are partially occult because we are alienated
from them, even as we are produced and managed by them. The invisible
infrastructure that sustains our lives is what matters politically right
now. And insofar as the technosphere is cybernetic, it is inextricable
from capitalism and politics.

3\.

Human [communication is at the **center** of the cybernetic global
order]{.underline}. The neural system of globalized networked society is
digital communication. In a 1975 film called Comment ça va?, Anne-Marie
Miéville and Jean-Luc Godard discuss the "illness" of information. They
begin with an image of the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, published
in the leftist newspaper Libération. At the time, photojournalistic
images had begun to proliferate as a form of information, and Godard and
Miéville critique Libération (the most left-wing newspaper in Europe in
those days) for failing to include the reader in the creation and
dissemination of information. They ask: "How is it that things enter and
exit the machine?" (Comment ça va de l'entrée à la sortie de la
machine?). [This question is about how ideas]{.underline},
[words]{.underline}, [discourses]{.underline}, [human
interaction]{.underline}, and images [**become information** and then
reach readers]{.underline} and viewers.

In Comment ça va?, mass media represents an illness that has killed
communication and language. Last year, Godard updated his critique of
the media in an interview posted to Instagram. He stated: "Plato's cave
has been fixed on paper/screen." For Godard, [the consequence of the
becoming-information of communication and language is the **loss of
ambiguity**]{.underline} in communication. Digital technology has
infiltrated every aspect of existence, and [the margin of error between
the transmission and the reception of a message has been
**eliminated**]{.underline} by mediatization and digitization. For
Godard, [digital communication]{.underline} denies the force of the
image or the word because it [eliminates **redundancy**]{.underline},
**[misunderstanding]{.underline}**, the possibility of reading between
the lines, [and the **possibility of alterity**]{.underline}.

In a more recent film of his---Adieu au language from 2014---Godard
suggests that digital media have destroyed face-to-face communication.
He asks: What kind of self could emerge in a time when objects and
bodies are disfigurable and refigurable through virtual manipulation?
Godard posits that [the **origins of**]{.underline} today's
[**totalitarianism** can be traced to the **interruption of interior
experience** by the spectacle]{.underline}. In the film, Godard features
a lengthy quote from Philippe Sollers explaining that the spectacle
"cuts off" the subject from its interior life---a process that is,
paradoxically, highly seductive. Furthermore, for Godard [digital
communication creates a new form of **isolated solitude** where people
lack ties to others]{.underline}. In this light, technology has not
become an extension of man, as Marshall McLuhan predicted, but has
instead attained autonomy from man, since digital media can communicate
amongst themselves without human mediation. For Godard, this means that
[the]{.underline} "[face-to-face]{.underline}"
[encounter]{.underline}---a basic form of human relation that is [the
**foundation of ethics**]{.underline}---[is **no longer
possible**]{.underline}.

Sherry Turkle, a clinical psychologist and sociologist, comes to similar
conclusions: daily conversations no longer involve eye contact, and
face-to-face discussion has been replaced by words on a screen.
According to Turkle, texts, tweets, Facebook posts, Instagram messages,
and Snapchats split our attention and diminish our capacity for empathy.
They have created new codes of etiquette; no longer do we feel
restrained from reaching for our phones in the presence of other people.
[This]{.underline} new etiquette [entrenches a culture of
**individualism** and **isolation**]{.underline} from each other.
[This]{.underline} isolation [cultivates the **perfect ground for
fascism**]{.underline}.

The [digitization]{.underline} of communication [not only has political
and communal consequences]{.underline}. [It also affects the
**neuroplastic potential** of the living brain]{.underline}. The
cybernetic episteme reshapes our working memory by rearranging its
contents. As Warren Neidich writes, [the new focus]{.underline} of power
[is]{.underline} not only the false reproduction of the past (the
manipulation of the archive), but [the manipulation of our]{.underline}
working memory---the type of memory that influences our
**[decision-making]{.underline}**. [Authoritarian neuropower wants
**nothing less**]{.underline} than to shape our future memory, argues
Neidich.

If the nervous system of cybernetics is digital communication, at the
center of digital communication is desire. Mark Fisher devoted his last
lectures at Goldsmiths in 2017 to this subject. During one lecture, he
played for his students a famous Apple TV commercial from 1984, directed
by Ridley Scott and originally broadcast during the Superbowl. In an
overt reference to George Orwell's novel 1984, the commercial depicts a
dreary, repressive control society. This society is seemingly liberated
when a buxom blonde woman tosses a sledgehammer at a large screen
broadcasting the image of an authoritarian figure, causing the screen to
explode. The commercial ends with these lines crawling across the
screen: "On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And
you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984." Fisher observes that the video
counterposes top-down bureaucratic control to upstart
entrepreneurialism. The dreary control society depicted in the
commercial is an allusion to not only the Soviet Union, but also IBM,
the dominant computer maker at the time. Apple posits itself as the
dynamic, colorful new company that will liberate society from dreary
IBM, ushering in a new, more vibrant world order. This new world order
will fulfill our (capitalist) desires in a way that the communist world
cannot. As Fisher suggests, we now live in that world of libidinal
capitalism.

Elsewhere Fisher writes that what drives the circulation of information
is the user's desire to make one more connection, to leave one more
reply, to keep on clicking. Capitalism persists because cyberspace is
already under our skin, writes Fisher; to retreat from it would be like
trying to retreat into some nonexistent precapitalist imaginary. In his
view, we believe we have as much a chance of escaping capitalism as we
do of crawling back inside our mother's womb.

By means of the cybernetic episteme, Silicon Valley has shaped the world
we all live in. As we are poisoned equally by microplastics and fake
news, losing our grasp of a shared reality, the "Silicon Six"---as Sacha
Baron Cohen called the titans of Silicon Valley in a 2019
speech---propagate algorithm-fueled fear, propaganda, lies, and hate in
the name of profit. As Baron Cohen pointed out, the major online
platforms largely avoid the kind of regulation and accountability that
other media companies are subject to. "This is ideological imperialism,"
he said. "Six unelected individuals in Silicon Valley impos\[e\] their
vision on the rest of the world, unaccountable to any government, and
acting as if they are above the law." He called digital platforms the
greatest propaganda machine in history.

[Democratic institutions have **failed to reign in** the information
chaos and the destruction of the public sphere]{.underline}. As Shoshana
Zuboff argues, [we inhabit a communications sphere that is **no longer a
public sphere**]{.underline}. She describes this situation as an
"epistemic coup" that has taken place in four stages: First, by way of
companies gathering personal data about us and then claiming it as their
own private property. Second, through data inequality, which means that
companies know more than we do. Third, through the epistemic chaos
created by algorithms. And fourth, through the institutionalization of
this new episteme and the erosion of democratic governance.

Baron Cohen observes that [people can take a stand against platforms by
recognizing our power to **boycott** them]{.underline}. (One example is
the mass defection from WhatsApp to Telegram when the former announced
that would share its user data with Facebook.) [But we also need
to]{.underline} defend the existence of facts and a shared reality,
[understand]{.underline}ing [the world **not** as something we **see**
but as something we **inhabit**]{.underline}---treating life not as
something we have, but as something we live. [Anti-platform
strategies]{.underline} might be accused of Luddism, but they [are **not
necessarily opposed** to technology]{.underline}---[only]{.underline} to
**[certain uses]{.underline}** of technology.

[It is also **crucial** that we regard the cybernetic episteme as
**inextricable** from a broader malaise]{.underline}: [humanity's
relationship to **life** and the **planet** is]{.underline} a
**[toxic]{.underline}** one. The very [technologies]{.underline} that
supposedly enable us to read, think, flourish, and desire [are
**destroying the world**]{.underline} we inhabit.

#### Vote affirmative to pursue insurgent governable stacks that increase security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the area of cybersecurity. The aff [reassembles]{.underline} the technical layers of the cybernetic episteme into new [stacks]{.underline}---layered architectures of hardware, software, networks, and infrastructure which divide the world into sovereign spaces---that can [fractally spill up]{.underline} to align with radical struggles across the globe. 

**Schneider, 22**---assistant professor of media studies at the
University of Colorado Boulder (Nathan, "Governable Stacks against
Digital Colonialism," tripleC 20 (1): 19-36, 2022, dml)

The spinning wheel remains a cipher and a site of conflict, an everyday
technology summoned to a contest over the meaning of democracy. Despite
having political ties with Gandhi's assassin, the Hindu nationalist
prime minister Narendra Modi promotes homespun cloth and has done
photo-ops operating a spinning wheel. Modi has meanwhile shuttered
boards that gave artisans a voice in policy under the slogan "Minimum
Government and Maximum Governance" (Vincent 2020). The [technology
itself does not guarantee self-governance]{.underline}, [but it can be
the **symbolic base** from which **ever-enlarging acts** of
self-governance **defeat an empire**]{.underline}.

In the spirit of the technological cipher [I propose the pursuit
of]{.underline} "**[governable stacks]{.underline}**": [an orientation
toward **ungovernable organising** under digital
colonialism]{.underline}.

The geek-colloquial meaning of stack, in the most relevant sense, is a
set of interoperating hardware and software. Benjamin H. Bratton (2016,
xvii) goes further, describing [the stack as]{.underline} "[a new
architecture for how we divide the world into sovereign
spaces]{.underline}". Its layers [come with **intersecting relations**
of dependency]{.underline}, [along with **emergent
freedoms**]{.underline}. [A stack might include all that enables one to
use a]{.underline} social media [service]{.underline}, for instance:
[the **server farms**]{.underline}, [the **corporation**]{.underline}
that owns them, [its **investors**]{.underline}, [the
**software**]{.underline} the servers run on, [the]{.underline} secret
**[algorithms]{.underline}** that analyse one's data, [the **mobile
device**]{.underline}, its accelerometer sending biometric data to the
server farm, [the **network provider**]{.underline}, [the backdoor
access for **law enforcement**]{.underline}, and so on. The layers of a
stack might further include [the **sun** or **coal** powering
it]{.underline}, [the **wars** fuelled by rare-earth
mining]{.underline}, [and the **mythologies** and **rituals** that
dictate what people in it will tolerate]{.underline}. Each layer is in
fact multiple layers, and layers build on each other.

Before governable stacks were the topic of this article, they were an
experience for me, particularly through an organisation in which I have
been an anecdotal participantobserver for a decade. **[May
First]{.underline}** Movement Technology (mayfirst.coop) is a
cooperative that [provides **web hosting**]{.underline}, **[cloud
services]{.underline}**, [and **public education** for]{.underline} a
850-strong membership composed largely of [activist
organisations]{.underline} in the United States and Mexico (Lopez et al.
2007). Through [the tools]{.underline} May First offers, I have been
able to [move]{.underline} much of my daily [computing **away** from
companies that **surveil** and **extract** into]{.underline} servers I
co-own and govern, running **[commons-based software]{.underline}**. I
have formed relationships with the people who maintain these services
and participated in decision-making over bilingual conference calls and
online ballots. I learn about new tools from fellow members, and we
sponsor events that teach people outside our membership how to challenge
the power of big tech in their lives and their communities. Akin to the
slow food movement, [this is **slow computing**]{.underline} (Schneider
2015), its pace [measured not by bandwidth or processing speed but by
the attention to the **social dimensions** of everyday
practice]{.underline}.

While Silicon Valley elites escape to phone-free retreats (Marantz 2019)
and agonise about their children's exposure to screens (Bowles 2018),
May First offers no such "abhorrence of machinery" (Chaplin 1966, 373).
[It **does not accept the false choice** between]{.underline} addictive,
[**surveillance-addled apps** and a **fantasy of**]{.underline}
returning to **[some blissful innocence]{.underline}**. Instead,
[members share technologies that **do what they need** and that they can
**reasonably control**]{.underline}. [These technologies]{.underline},
[and the self-governance we surround them with]{.underline}, [are our
stack]{.underline}. May First does not demand that you 'learn to code',
or otherwise trade traditional knowledge for digital expertise. For me,
[being part of a governable stack]{.underline} like May First
[has]{.underline} **[unlocked political possibilities]{.underline}**.
[The experience motivated years of working to build governable stacks
elsewhere]{.underline}, because I know that it can be done. I poured
myself into [developing alternative ownership models like]{.underline}
"**[platform cooperatives]{.underline}**" (Schneider 2018)
[and]{.underline} "**[exit to community]{.underline}**" (Mannan and
Schneider 2021) [that are **better suited** to making tech
governable]{.underline}. With time, ungovernable stacks have come to
feel like foreign lands. I may use them, but they never feel like home.

[Governable stacks are cyborg assemblages of inter-operating
technology]{.underline}, [in symbiosis with human
relationships]{.underline} (Haraway 1991; Puar 2012). [Those
relationships]{.underline} [organise power]{.underline}, [in
**partnership** with the technology more than through **domination**
over it]{.underline}. [We learn with each other]{.underline}, [and we
learn with the machines]{.underline}, which take on life of their own --
through their own intelligence, or that which we affectionately project
onto them. In the sense of Grace Lee and Jimmy Boggs's dialectical
humanism, [governable stacks]{.underline} [invite the people who use
them to **change their relationship** with technologies]{.underline},
[to **imagine different sorts** of technologies]{.underline}, [and to be
**changed themselves**]{.underline}.

[Perhaps governability can be achieved by **reconfiguring** tools that
already exist]{.underline}; [perhaps it is necessary to **make new
ones**]{.underline}. Tiziana Terranova (2014), who has proposed the
complementary idea of a "red stack", writes that [insurgent stacks
become]{.underline} "[new platforms through a **crafty bricolage** of
existing technologies]{.underline}, the enactment of new subjectivities
through a detournement of widespread social media literacy". Older
technologies may be better suited to this than newer ones (Maxigas and
Latzko-Toth 2020). [Even the colonial platforms can be
**repurposed**]{.underline} -- as the Algerian writer Kateb Yacine said
of the French language -- [as **spoils of war**]{.underline}. [The
lifeblood of the governable stack is not any claim to innovation but the
self-governance that flows through it]{.underline}. What emerges from
there is the point.

The **[Guifi.net]{.underline}** community Internet network in Catalonia
(guifi.net) [became the condition of possibility for a suite
of]{.underline} "**[community cloud]{.underline}**"
[services]{.underline} deployed through it (Selimi et al. 2015).
**[FairTEC]{.underline}** (fairtec.io) [combines]{.underline} into one
product [a stack of preexisting services across]{.underline} three
[European countries]{.underline}: a sustainably manufactured smartphone,
a non-commercial operating system, a cooperative telecom, and a
cooperative phone rental company. The developers of the
**[CommonsCloud]{.underline}** (commonscloud.coop) [see their shared
technology as only one layer of a larger community stack]{.underline},
[which also includes]{.underline} "**[social]{.underline}**"
[and]{.underline} "**[discursive]{.underline}**" [layers]{.underline} --
the context and substance of their self-governance. Layers form over
time, too. [Governable stacks of the past lurk in the archaeology of
colonial systems through legacies like **Indymedia**]{.underline}, an
activist social network whose participatory servers and software
prefigured the corporate "Web 2.0" (Pickard 2006). Indymedia itself drew
from decades of organising among activist communityradio stations,
particularly in Latin America (Ruiz Martinez 2021). [There can be **no
one governable stack**]{.underline} -- [only **many**]{.underline},
[whose archipelagos of commoning **enable each other** and **give rise
to more**]{.underline}.

Technologists seeking alternative visions have often gravitated to the
Free Software and Open Source movements, which employ creative licensing
to enable the sharing of accessible and modifiable code. These movements
have been successful in terms of the sheer volume of widely used
software in their commons. But their emphasis on the freedoms of
individual users, as well as of corporations, has privileged those with
the technical know-how to take advantage. The software commons has
spawned operating systems that fly in military jets and databases that
aid in the imprisonment of asylum seekers (Ehmke 2020). In the name of
freedom, too, developers have harboured sexism and other forms of
exclusionary culture (SSL Nagbot 2016). Governable stacks should
prioritise community accountability alongside individual freedom.

[Another emerging strategy for challenging digital colonialism has come
from **within**]{.underline}. [Employees]{.underline} at Silicon Valley
giants [have achieved reforms by organising against certain ethical
outrages at their workplaces]{.underline} (Tarnoff 2020). [Yet there are
**limits** to what these campaigns are likely to achieve]{.underline},
[since these]{.underline} workers are invested -- often literally,
through stock options -- in the basic business models of their
employers. Employees' actions [can present the impression that their
protest **cleanses** the colonial tools they produce]{.underline}.
[Governable stacks do not seek merely to **improve the
occupier**]{.underline}. "Decolonization is not an 'and'", as Tuck and
Yang (2012) put it. "It is an elsewhere" (36).

Experiences with governable stacks introduce us to possible elsewheres.
The spinning wheel was an elsewhere, the invention of a democratic
India. May First Movement Technology is an elsewhere for its members,
who in turn become part of its learning and evolving. Collectives,
families, and movements can assemble and adjust their stacks over time,
wherever possible seeking to make their technological lives ever more
governable. I next turn to strategies to guide the process of doing so.

5\. Governable Strategy

May First is infinitesimally small by the standards of the tech economy.
"Goldman Sachs doesn't care if you're raising chickens", as the
political theorist Jodi Dean (2011) has said. It's a reminder for anyone
tempted to see too much potential in personal practices, technological
or otherwise. But spinning wheels are small, too, and they helped drive
away the British Empire.

adrienne maree brown (2017) credits Grace Lee Boggs for helping her see
that (her emphasis) "[what we practice at the small scale **sets the
patterns** for the **whole system**]{.underline}". She explains this in
a chapter called "Fractals", which recalls how she shifted her activism
to better reflect her political values in daily practice. [Fractals are
mathematical phenomena]{.underline}, frequent in nature, [whose patterns
at smaller scales **repeat** at larger scales]{.underline}. They are
appealing and widely used as a metaphor, being both mathematically
precise in theory and conveniently vague when applied to human affairs.
Those like brown and Boggs who apply fractal-talk to politics exercise a
kind of faith. To make good on that faith, there must some linkage, some
strategy, that connects self-governance from the scale of small
communities to the larger societies those community seek to transform.
[There was a fractal in the **free maroons of Saint-Domingue** who
stormed down from their mountains into combat with French troops so the
whole island could be free]{.underline}.

[There was a fractal in]{.underline} the spinning wheel on [the **Indian
National Congress** flag]{.underline}, [extending from a traditional
practice to an eventual industrial policy]{.underline}. These chickens
came to roost because they were part of a strategy that involved
organised confrontation with colonial power. [Self-governing became a
**challenge**]{.underline}, [a **threat**]{.underline}. In **[even small
experiments]{.underline}**, governable stacks [can begin to
**normalise** the otherwise elusive fact that **better ways of
organising technology** are possible]{.underline}. [Carefully chosen
practices **sever habits of dependency** on the systems we seek to
resist]{.underline}.

It is an uncomfortable matter of fact that nowhere has been so
successful a counterweight to the power of Silicon Valley as China. The
country has not only barred certain data-colonising companies with its
'Great Firewall' but has cultivated comparably ubiquitous Internet
firms, using comparably invasive colonial practices to produce platforms
that are at once hyper-capitalist and dominated by state interests (Chu
2017; Hong 2017). And yet China's policy of sovereignty shows that
dependence on hostile stacks is not inevitable.

Rather than trading one colonial power for another, [**Western Europe**
has sought a high road in demanding **privacy regulations** and
investments in **commons-based technology**]{.underline} (Lemley 2020).
[Projects such as the **Sovereign Cloud Stack**]{.underline}
(scs.community) [seek to supplant reliance on corporate walled gardens
with **globally replicable**]{.underline}, **[locally deployed
tools]{.underline}**. [Several]{.underline} European [governments have
adopted and funded **free/open-source software**]{.underline} like the
Matrix (matrix.org) messaging protocol and NextCloud (nextcloud.com), a
file-sharing platform. Countries far from the power centres, like Uganda
and Lebanon, have experimented with imposing taxes on the use of foreign
social media (Boxell and Steinert-Threlkeld 2019). [Although such
efforts have been widely perceived as acts of repression more than
solidarity]{.underline}, [similar policies could be used for **different
goals**]{.underline}. Echoing the Cold War-era Non-Aligned Movement
among countries caught between the United States and the Soviet Union,
[some have been calling for a]{.underline} "**[digital non-aligned
movement]{.underline}**" [that asserts many diverse
sovereignties]{.underline} against the duelling forces of Silicon Valley
and Shenzhen (Freuler 2020; Mejias 2020).

**[Sovereignty need not be solely the purview of nation
states]{.underline}**. [The discourse of digital sovereignty has been
particularly important among **indigenous communities** whose members
are used to seeing their pre-digital sovereignty effaced]{.underline};
[they have developed **governable stack-layers** such as **tribal
broadband lines**]{.underline} (Blackwater 2020),
**[cryptocurrencies]{.underline}** (Tekobbe and McKnight 2016), **[data
governance]{.underline}** (Carroll et al. 2020), [and **linguistic
autonomy**]{.underline} (Pinto 2018). Amelia Winger-Bearskin (2020)
draws on the Haudenosaunee practice of wampum agreements to propose
"**[ethical dependencies]{.underline}**" in software; these [would
encode and enforce certain commitments **up** and **down the
stack**]{.underline}. [Laying claim to collective
sovereignty]{.underline} is central to such practices. Glen Sean
Coulthard (2014) [**challenges** the]{.underline} "**[colonial politics
of recognition]{.underline}**" -- [when people accept their
**colonisers' definition** of their sovereignty]{.underline}, [rather
than their **own**]{.underline} -- [to insist on **more autonomous
forms** of self-determination]{.underline}. He describes how tribal
nations can produce sovereignty through "community-scale activities"
such as cooperatives and assemblies in everyday life (68). The
indigenous organiser Berta Cáceres, before her murder by Honduran
paramilitaries, denounced the pseudo-democracy of political
representatives but affirmed the "decisive" democracy possible through
poor people's movements (Castellanos and Pine 2020).

[Sovereignty can occur at levels ranging from the **network backbone**
to **last-mile connections**]{.underline}, [up through the **hardware**
and **software** of devices]{.underline}, [to the **collaboration
tools** in the cloud]{.underline}. [Sovereignty looks like a
**user-owned cooperative** or a **city providing
connectivity**]{.underline}, [or like **Douglass**]{.underline}
(douglass.io), an operating system whose apps take their names from
icons of Black liberation. The tech publication The Markup has paid
[a]{.underline} "**[privacy tax]{.underline}**" by developing its own
software that protects user data rather than adopting the standard
surveillance-based offerings (Angwin 2020). For **[Archive of Our
Own]{.underline}** (archiveofourown.org), a fan-run fandom repository,
sovereignty puts creators in control of how they publish and protects
their work against copyright overreach. [What makes technology sovereign
is when its stewards are the **people** who depend on it]{.underline},
[**protected** from outside control]{.underline} by any legal or
extra-legal means available. [The data]{.underline}, [the
algorithms]{.underline}, [and the interfaces are **for** their
users]{.underline}, [rather than acting surreptitiously **against**
them]{.underline}.

5.2. Democracy

[The other side]{.underline} of sovereignty [is participatory
democracy]{.underline} -- its guarantor and its everyday practice. Here
[we **resist** the temptation of **autocratic vanguardism** by designing
governable stacks to be **accountable** and **alive**]{.underline}. [The
style of democracy may be that of the **Debian operating
system**]{.underline}, [a constitutional republic of coders]{.underline}
(debian.org/devel/constitution), [or like the **Ethical Source
Movement's vision** of many collectives deciding on the ethical limits
of how their software can be used]{.underline} (ethicalsource.dev).
[Digital democracy is beginning to have dedicated tools]{.underline} --
[from smaller-group decisions on **Loomio**]{.underline} (loomio.org)
[to the scale of cities or countries through **Barcelona's
Decidim**]{.underline} (decidim.org) [or **Polis**]{.underline}
(pol.is), which is employed [by]{.underline} the government of
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** (Stempeck 2020). [Platform cooperatives
practice democracy at the level of the company]{.underline}, [such as at
**Stocksy**]{.underline} United (stocksy.com), co-owned by artists in
dozens of countries (Schneider 2018). [On a network scale]{.underline},
the federated social network [**Mastodon** was able to counteract an
incursion by]{.underline} the alt-right platform **[Gab]{.underline}**,
[as it did earlier with]{.underline} **[I]{.underline}**slamic
**[S]{.underline}**tate accounts -- [through self-organised
activity]{.underline} by server administrators and app developers
(Caelin 2020). [Countering hate speech doesn't need to depend on the
might of a **global monopoly**]{.underline}; [it can be **tangible** and
**empowering**]{.underline}.

[Practices of local democracy from the Global South have been migrating
into **governable online tools**]{.underline}. [Participatory budgeting
practices originating from **Porto Alegre**]{.underline}, Brazil
(Cabannes 2004), [have appeared in]{.underline} apps like
**[Cobudget]{.underline}** (cobudget.co) [and **Decidim**]{.underline}.
A founder of an experimental political party in Argentina, **[Partido
Red]{.underline}**, [has applied the same logic]{.underline} of "liquid
democracy" [to a blockchain-based governance platform]{.underline},
**[Democracy Earth]{.underline}** (democracy.earth). **[Mexico
City's]{.underline}** 2016 [exercise in crowdsourcing its constitution
has]{.underline} been studied as [a **model around the
world**]{.underline}.

[Digital democracy has the potential to evolve **rapidly** and
**creatively**]{.underline}. [People can participate in **far more
rapid** and **fine-grained ways** than was possible when the prevailing
regimes of corporate and state governance first appeared]{.underline}.
Organisational [designs that work well could become part of a
**governance commons**]{.underline}, [enabling other groups to
**adopt**]{.underline}, **[adapt]{.underline}**, [and **share** them
back into the common pool]{.underline} (Schneider et al. 2021). In this
way, [small-scale accountability can **spread**]{.underline}, [and it
can creep into **larger** and **larger kinds** of
communities]{.underline}, [demonstrating that colonial control was
**never necessary**]{.underline}. **[The more we demand and practice the
arts of self-governing]{.underline}**, **[the harder we are for someone
else to govern]{.underline}**.

5.3. Insurgency

The spinning wheel stood for household autonomy, but it was also
defiance against British rule. [Governable stacks must be]{.underline}
similarly **[insurgent]{.underline}**. [Some of the earliest online
social media emerged through **Indymedia's coverage** of anti-capitalist
protests]{.underline}. [**Twitter** has its roots in technology for
coordinating street protests]{.underline} (Costanza-Chock 2020, Chapter
3). [While investors and accelerators receive frequent credit for
innovation]{.underline}, [insurgency is **just as much** a source of
it]{.underline}.

[Insurgency might mean challenging government subpoenas of member
data]{.underline}, [as **May First** has done]{.underline}, [or
facilitating leaks about abuses of power]{.underline}. [Resistance might
take the form of what the **Catalan Integral Cooperative**
calls]{.underline} "**[economic disobedience]{.underline}**"
(cooperativa.cat/economic-disobedience), [which includes refusing to pay
unjust taxes or interest]{.underline}. [Insurgents might choose not to
submit the data of a friendship to the social graphs of colonial
platforms]{.underline}, [or to actively deceive those
platforms]{.underline}, [just as the **Tor** network]{.underline}
(torproject.org) [disguises its users' locations]{.underline}. [Like
**Copwatch** groups or the **Driver's Seat Cooperative**]{.underline}
(driversseat.sco), [insurgents can do data collection on the
colonisers]{.underline}, **[sousveillance from below]{.underline}**
(Browne 2015).

To the extent that establishing the expansionist, slaveholding republic
of the United States was also an anticolonial conflict, it relied on
self-governance as resistance. The colonists organised through a
Continental Congress, which extracted lessons from the Haudenosaunee
nations -- yes to confederation, no to matriarchal authority -- to
prefigure a future government. After independence, Alexis de Tocqueville
(1840/2006) observed how the flourishing of civic associations energised
the politics of the fledgling republic. Successful poor people's
struggles against the country's wealthy elites, from the 19th-century
Populists (Goodwyn 1978) to the 20th-century movements for Black power
(Nembhard 2014), grew out of tangible collective organising in labour
unions and cooperatives.

[Insurgents might use colonial platforms for **education** and
**organising**]{.underline}. [They might **spread viral messages** and
**enjoy themselves**]{.underline}. [But if they have **governable
stacks** to go back to]{.underline}, [they are **more than just
subjects**]{.underline}. [They are **maroons**]{.underline}, [with
**swamps** and **forests** of their own]{.underline}.

#### Governable stacks are the only solvent mechanism for cybersecurity cooperation. Legal mechanisms for constraining cyberwar are a [pipe dream]{.underline}; the proliferation of debates on those terms creates a [smokescreen]{.underline} for cybernetic infrastructure to spread across the planet, which makes militarism and nuclear annihilation [inevitable]{.underline}. We must [reorient]{.underline} the resolutional model of thought towards [corporeal care]{.underline}.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko, 19**---associate professor of
information and media studies at the University of Western Ontario;
assistant professor of communication at Simon Fraser University (Nick
and Svitlana, "What Is to Be Done?," *Cyberwar and Revolution: Digital
Subterfuge in Global Capitalism*, Chapter 3, 151-161, dml)

As we have argued, from 1945 on, [the hegemonic status of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, as
the world's chief capitalist power, [was **intrinsically related** to
the development of]{.underline} computers and networks. The role of
[digital systems]{.underline} in its military--industrial complex,
initially tightly coupled with nuclear weapons, spread through other
aspects of its war-making system as well as through the general economy.
In both aspects, it contributed to the United States's eventual Cold War
victory. In the aftermath of that victory, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [continued to
develop]{.underline} its digital military capacities into the ever more
direct weaponization of network, creating [the **technological human
assemblages** of]{.underline} what is today referred to as
**[cyberwar]{.underline}**. The scope of NSA global surveillance and
sabotage programs and the sophistication of the Stuxnet nuclear
centrifuge-destroying malware are only the most manifest instances of
[this process]{.underline}, which [is]{.underline} today [an **integral
part** of a wider upgrade of U.S. military capacities that ties together
a **nuclear primacy** with the **militarization of space** and **drone
warfare**]{.underline}. [Accompanying and spurring on this process is
the]{.underline} additional [dynamic of cyberwar adoption by the forces
**antagonistic** to]{.underline} the global dominance of
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its **allies**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} antagonists
[include]{.underline} the defeated socialist powers, [**Russia** and
**China**]{.underline}, now paradoxically resurrected as capitalist
competitors in the world market, or, in the case of **[North
Korea]{.underline}**, surviving in a macabre afterlife of state
socialism. They also include the forces of **[militant Islamic
jihadism]{.underline}**, beckoned into existence by the West as an
anticommunist ally, only to become its opponent in the long war on
terror. [All these actors **converge** on the militarization of digital
networks]{.underline}. Many observers today see a moment that
recapitulates the decline of previous imperial hegemons within the
global capitalist system---Spain, Holland, Britain---and parallels the
moments of extreme instability as old powers and new contenders confront
each other.7 [The rise of cyberwar is]{.underline} part of this tumult
and quite possibly [a precursor and preparation for **widening** and
**intensifying conflict**]{.underline}. Schematically, [we can
envisage]{.underline} three potentially intertwining trajectories such a
process might take:

1\. Network degradation. Alexander Klimburg (2017) outlines the
possibility of a "darkening web" characterized by [**persistent** and
**gradually intensifying** cyberwar between states and between states
and terrorist movements conducted in a **variety of
registers**]{.underline}. [Security breaches]{.underline}, [aggressive
malware]{.underline}, [and botnet attacks **proliferate**]{.underline}.
[Digital industrial sabotage and critical infrastructure attacks begin
to **multiply**]{.underline}, [as do the **accidental runaway effects**
of cyberweapons]{.underline}. Networks are deeply and chronically
infected with computational propaganda, fake news, and viral mis- and
disinformation. [In response to adversarial incursions]{.underline},
[states intensify **algorithmic surveillance**]{.underline},
**[censorship]{.underline}**, [and **preemptive virtual
policing**]{.underline}. [Cybersecurity provisions become **increasingly
mandatory** and **elaborate**]{.underline}. [Attribution
problems]{.underline}, [falsification]{.underline} of evidence,
[and]{.underline} the [overlap]{.underline} between military and
intelligence forces and criminal networks [create a **chaotic digital
twilight**]{.underline} of hacking and trolling, botnets and viruses,
malware, surveillance, and bugs, shutdowns, blocking, and filtering, [in
which uncertainties **exacerbate** suspicions and
hostilities]{.underline}, altogether making the internet increasingly
impossible to use. In short, the "darkening web" is what already exists
now, only more so. One of the cofounders of Twitter, Evan Williams,
offered his diagnosis, suggesting that "the Internet is broken"
(Streitfeld 2017). But maybe it's not. Maybe the internet is finally
what it was always meant to be. Maybe it is perfect, but not for us, the
excommunicated user-subjects. For cyberwar.

2\. Hybrid escalations. Similarly rooted in the present is the
likelihood that the [simultaneous virtual and kinetic
conflicts]{.underline}, such as the Syrian civil war, the fighting in
Donbas, and the many branches of the war on terror, [continue and break
out in new regions]{.underline}, [bringing **ever higher levels** and
**varieties** of cyberweapons]{.underline}, deployed for purposes
ranging from intelligence gathering, battlefield surveillance, and
munitions delivery to sabotage of enemies' domestic and military
resources. The use of drones and other semi- or fully automated weapons
systems expands and takes new directions, such as the development of
swarms of small autonomous vehicles---"slaughterbots" (Economist
2017a)---for house-to-house fighting in ruined cities. The biometric and
networked tracking of refugees created by such conflicts, and the
control and interdiction of their entry to affluent fortressed
homelands, becomes a major activity of the nation-state security
apparatus. Because present hybrid wars are also in large part proxy
wars, where local battlefield actors are directly or indirectly
supported by major powers, they are charged with the possibility of
abrupt collisions between the most powerful militaries on the planet.

3\. "Thermonuclear cyberwar." We borrow this phrase from Erik Gartzke
and Jon Lindsay (2017), who are among several authors currently pointing
to a renewed and dangerous rendezvous between cyber- and nuclear
weaponry. The last decade of debates between defense intellectuals about
cyberwar has split those who see digital attacks a new equivalent of
nuclear weapons, capable of disabling whole societies through critical
infrastructure attacks, and skeptics who deride such anxieties as
hyperbolic and implausible. But "**[cyber]{.underline}**"
[and]{.underline} "**[nuke]{.underline}**" [are **not
separate**]{.underline}. As we have seen, [they were twinned at the
moment of conception]{.underline}, with the development of each
dependent on the other. And [the connection is not just
historical]{.underline}; [it is **current**]{.underline}. Now [cyberwar
weaponry is part of a new approach to nuclear war fighting]{.underline},
the left-of-launch approach. Early ventures in antiballistic missile
defense, such as Reagan's "Star Wars" strategic defense initiative,
depended on shooting down swarms of missiles as they plunged through the
atmosphere toward their target. Left of launch, in contrast, aims to
"strike an enemy missile before liftoff or during the first seconds of
flight," using "cyber strikes, electronic warfare and other exotic forms
of sabotage" (Broad and Sanger 2017). This doctrine was incubated during
the Obama administration and inherited by the Trump presidency.
Advocates of the left-of-launch nuclear strategy present it as a
defensive measure. However, [the doctrine **destabilizes basic
premises** of deterrence that have]{.underline}, since 1945,
[**restrained** nuclear weapon use]{.underline} (Cimbala 2017).
Deterrence depends on a dread faith by all parties that both their own
and their enemies' nuclear weapons will work. [The possibility
that]{.underline} nuclear weapons [systems might be secretly disabled
raises prospects both of **overconfidence**]{.underline} (trusting one
can sabotage an opponent's system) [or **panicked
preemption**]{.underline} (fearing left-of-launch attacks on one's own
nukes and falling into a "use 'em or lose 'em" mind-set). More
generally, [control and command of nuclear weapons depend on
communication systems whose collapse in a crisis situation could have
**catastrophic results**]{.underline}.8 The origin of the internet lay
in the U.S. attempt to ensure continuance of such systems in the event
of nuclear war; now [the weaponization of the internet]{.underline}
itself [constitutes a possible cause of **nuclear war**]{.underline}.

Facing such prospects, [liberal commentators propose **diplomatic
measures** to control and mitigate cyberhostilities]{.underline}.
Klimburg (2017), for example, suggests a series of initiatives to be
undertaken primarily by the United Nations and the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the long-standing (and
controversy-ridden) forum for internet governance. In these venues, he
suggests, it should be possible to work out a series of
agreements---"[digital arms]{.underline}" **[limitation
treaties]{.underline}**, comparable to those on nuclear weapons;
[an]{.underline} "[attribution and adjudication]{.underline}"
[**council** to assess and arbitrate responsibility]{.underline} for
cyberattacks; [**international cooperation** against
cybercrime]{.underline}; the [promotion]{.underline} within ICANN
[of]{.underline} "**[civil society]{.underline}**"
[perspectives]{.underline} to counter those of states and corporations.
He suggests that "standing bodies" regulating cyberwar would be
comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and
emphasizes the importance of "scientific and authoritative advice from
experts to political decision makers on how to avoid disaster" (344).

[Such proposals]{.underline}, seemingly eminently sensible, [**ignore**
the reality that the tensions driving the rise of cyberwar are also
**incapacitating** the fragile apparatuses and institutions of
international cooperation]{.underline} that have existed since 1945. As
Jon Lindsay (2012) observes, while proposals for [cyberwarfare
treaties]{.underline} are "well meaning," they [would]{.underline},
[within the current state of international great power
relations]{.underline}, [be]{.underline} "**[hacked to
bits]{.underline}**," [because]{.underline}
"[cyberoperations]{.underline}, like other types of intelligence and
covert operations, [take place in the **shadows**]{.underline}. [An
international treaty on cyberweapons would be]{.underline} . . .
**[totally unenforceable]{.underline}**, [since such activity is
designed to **evade** detection and attribution]{.underline}." The
conjuncture in which cyberwar rises, and part of the reason for its
ascent, is the breakdown of nuclear arms limitation and nonproliferation
treaties. Klimburg's comparison of the regulation of cyberwar and
climate change is unfortunately all too telling, given the failure of
global capitalism to generate any binding interstate agreements on
carbon emissions and the recent withdrawal of the United States from
even the nonbinding Paris accord on global warming. And like slowing
climate change, reducing the risk of cyberwar requires deep, systemic
social change.

The argument of this book is that cyberwar is a manifestation of the
competitive nature of capitalism, which, beneath the surface of
globalization, fosters a war of all against all, conducted in the
accelerated, automated, and abstracted forms on which this entire mode
of production now depends. It follows from this that [the prospects for
reducing the dangers of cyberwar]{.underline}, and of the other types of
war of which it is now part, [**depend strongly** on movements and
struggles to **constrain** and]{.underline}, ultimately, [**abolish**
this internally antagonistic order]{.underline}. A recognition of the
extreme difficulty of this project is inherent in the point on which we
opened this chapter, namely, Noys's observation that [the]{.underline}
military high-technology "**[endocolonization]{.underline}**" [of
society has been]{.underline} a factor in **[decomposing]{.underline}**
the traditional industrial working-class [movements]{.underline} that
were historically the main agencies of socialist and communist projects.
[However]{.underline}, [there is also a possible **reversal** of this
logic]{.underline}, [if averting]{.underline} war, including
[cyberwar]{.underline}, [becomes]{.underline} entwined with other
issues, such as struggles for social equality and ecological
sustainability, [a **focal point** for recomposition of movements
looking beyond capital]{.underline}, drawing on new and diverse
constituencies. We have indicated some of the issues that we think might
be drawn together around resistance to the rise of cyberwar:
antisurveillance sentiment, rejection of the secrecy of the security
state and its new digital complexes, concern over the corruption of the
general intellect by mis- and disinformation, objection to corporate and
military criminality, and, of course, revulsion at the exterminatory
horrors of war, from the terror of dirty wars to global thermonuclear
catastrophe.

In his reflections on Marxist theories of war and revolution, Balibar
(2002) remarks on the coexistence within this body of thought of two
contradictory elements, one stressing the idea of "revolutionary war,"
the other of "revolutionary peace." The first stresses "armed struggle
against capital," the second "the refusal of capitalist wars"---"in many
respects this class war is therefore also a non-war, or an anti-war"
(11). If, in the title to this chapter, we invoked Lenin's What Is to Be
Done?, it is partly to remember that, though Lenin is today primarily
thought of as a theorist of revolutionary war, perhaps the major
decision of Leninism was one for peace (even if his later adoption of
Trotsky's formula of "no war, no peace" resonates with today's state of
cyberwar). The outbreak of World War I precipitated a schism in the
international socialist movement. Leading European socialist democratic
parties all too rapidly discarded their longheld view that war
exemplified the irrationality of competitive capitalism, forgot their
commitments to peace and worldwide worker solidarity, rallied behind
their governments, and joined the march to mass slaughter. Only the
faction of what is sometimes known as the Zimmerwald Left (Nation 1989),
led by Lenin, continued to speak out for internationalism. It was thus
not just revolt against exploitation but rejection of the holocaust of
World War I, a program of "bread and peace," that gave communism a moral
claim to universality. Terrifying contemporary parallels to the pre1914
years today demand an updated strategy for "bread and peace," with
"bread" understood as a securing of ecological conditions for species
life and "peace" as elimination of systemic social violence.

One of the slogans of the Zimmerwald Left was "Krieg dem Krieg," "war on
war," and it is tempting to take this up, in a very literal sense, and
propose a "cyberwar on cyberwar." As we have seen, there is a hacking
front to both the struggles against digital militarism and contemporary
anticapitalist movements. They have exposed the workings of the cyberwar
complex and brought it to light. Their main figures are defectors from
that complex. More broadly, over recent decades, many critical theorists
have argued for forms of "cyborg" dissent and for deployment of the arms
available to "immaterial labor," whether in the networked mobilization
of protest or in more direct digital disruptions of war making. Cyberwar
on cyberwar is both a metaphorical and practical possibility, and we
have seen situations when "Krieg dem Krieg," in the most concrete sense,
is the only effective response to murderous attack.

However, we would suggest that to conduct "cyberwar on cyberwar," though
it may sometimes be necessary, is to fight on unfavorable terrain. We
have seen that hacktivism suffers problems of accountability,
transparency, provocation; can itself be compromised and ensnared within
the exploits of the military--internet complex; and is ultimately highly
vulnerable to the police and intelligence apparatus. And, as Noys (2013)
observes, even reliance on the speed with which networks can circulate
struggles tends to discount how much more advantage such velocity today
gives capital's military--security complexes (in this respect, we note
that the huge, worldwide, and digitally mobilized protests against the
Iraq War in 2003 must be reckoned a tragic failure of networked
activism). Cyberwar on cyberwar is a method of fast politics, and speed
is where the user-subjects ultimately lose, encountering the inhuman
acceleration of machinic processing power. To succeed, such resistance
requires a break from the mainstream paradigm of today's "platform
capitalism" with all its repetitious "Twitter revolutions," "Facebook
revolutions," or "Snapchat revolutions," slogans that should remind us
that, as Lacan once notoriously noted, an ultimate misconception of
revolution is as a desire for a new master or a master in a new form
that leads away from the systemic change rather than not toward it. Here
we disagree with the conclusion of Brian Massumi's (2015, 243) otherwise
excellent study of the new "ontopowers" of military networking, where,
discussing the logic of speed and preemption, he suggests that
countermovements have no choice but to "go forward, with the flow."

While tactical resistance can involve any and all of the "memes of
production" (Deterritorial Support Group 2012), a reconstitution of the
left today must ask, what is the opposite of cyberwar? To this, we would
answer that [the antithesis of cyberwar is **corporeal care of the
subject** achieved through the]{.underline} "[balanced conceptions of
space and time within culture]{.underline}" [and]{.underline}
"[awareness of]{.underline} spatial and temporal [dynamics]{.underline}
\[[that]{.underline}\] [keep state and market power in
check]{.underline}" (Sharma 2013, 314). It is from this perspective that
[we need to recognize cyberwar's production of time and space and
envision different times and spaces]{.underline}---those [of the **care
of bodies**]{.underline}. [This orientation]{.underline} against the
social destruction, physical, psychological, and infrastructural, of
cyberwar [does not mean **totally abandoning** the
digital]{.underline}---[which]{.underline}, because it so much composes
the very texture of everyday life, [would be not only **difficult** but
often **politically fatal**]{.underline}. But [it does mean its
**rearticulation** to a set of purposes **radically different** from
those of digital capital]{.underline}. In particular, [this]{.underline}
strategy [requires **theoretical reconsideration** and **practical
subversion**]{.underline} of the addicted, complicit digital user, the
figure envisioned by neoliberal Silicon Valley, [by way of]{.underline}
desynchronization and emancipation.

This can be described as [recognizing a position **in** and **against**
the military environment of cyberwar in which all of us are now
imbricated and finding ways to **develop subjectivities** that are
simultaneously **of** the network and **off** the network]{.underline}.
[It requires the]{.underline} "**[slow]{.underline}**" [time necessary
for the **in-person**]{.underline} ([rather than
**online**]{.underline}) [organization of **antiwar
collectives**]{.underline}, **[movements]{.underline}**, [and
**alliances**]{.underline}; defection from compulsive social media use;
trammeling corporate capacities to intensify and maintain such addictive
behavior; [the **patient defense** and **reconstruction** of the basic
public institutions of corporeal care]{.underline}---free health
services; the cultivation of mental health; [the recovery and deepening
of the]{.underline} legacy of a semidestroyed (or, in many places, never
created) **[welfare state]{.underline}** in a new "commonfare";
[**universal education** provisions]{.underline}; [**worker--community
control** of workplaces and the means of production]{.underline};
**[ecological protections]{.underline}**---[and the assertion of such
priorities **against** the expense and logic of **networked
militarization**]{.underline}. [In this work of solidarity]{.underline},
[the subject **exploited** and **excommunicated** by digital capitalism
can transition from **alienation** toward **reciprocity**]{.underline}.
And [to those who say that the accelerated logic of cyberwar means we
**don't have time** to do all this before catastrophe
arrives]{.underline}, we just say, **[you may be right]{.underline}**,
**[but still we have to do it anyway!]{.underline}** We can build a
"counterwar machine" constructed on the diagonal line that runs between
waging cyberwar on cyberwar and fostering the caring corporeality that
is opposite of cyberwar.

At the end of her study of world labor activism, Beverly Silver (2003,
176) notes a major reason for the shortage of militant working-class
movements in the early twenty-first century. Neoliberalism's
restructuring, globalization, and financialization, with its "growing
structural unemployment, escalating inequalities and major disruptions,"
has repeated the crisis patterns of previous eras of capitalism, with
one crucial exception. The missing condition is large-scale armed
conflict. This "global political--military context contrasts sharply
with . . . that \[which\] produced radicalized and explosive labour
unrest in the first half of the twentieth century." As Silver notes, war
then involved the mass mobilization of populations that characterized
total war. States depended on their working classes to provide not just
millions of soldiers but labor in munition plants, shipyards and
aircraft factories, hospitals, and farms. When mass mobilization met the
horror of mass deaths and mutilation, revolutionary social turmoil could
result.

As Silver (2003, 175) observes, advanced capitalism's turn to high
technological weaponry apparently breaks this link between war and
worker revolt. Cyberwar can be seen as an extension of
[this]{.underline} "**[automation of war]{.underline}**." Nonetheless,
as we have suggested, the tendency of digital militarization to
liquidate the labor of war [is **not yet completely
fulfilled**]{.underline}. [Humans remain as the **indispensable
conscious links** and **relays** within the networks and nodes of
digital conflict]{.underline}. Indeed, what [we have seen]{.underline}
in this book is [the **surprisingly wide diffusion** of
participation]{.underline} in cyberwarfare, from the highly specialized
military and intelligence units at the cutting edge of advanced
cyberoperations to strata of mercenary and criminal proxies, online
vigilantes, patriotic hackers, corporate and criminal marketers of
cyberweaponry, cybersecurity personnel, and on to the corporate content
moderators and state censors and surveillance agents now indispensable
to the prosecution of war waged in cyberspace and across scores of
hybrid battlefields. To these more or less intentional contributions to
the mechanisms of cyberwar must be added [the]{.underline} unknowing (or
partially unknowing) [participation of network users]{.underline}, whose
online activities and addictions [provide the **vital vectors**
for]{.underline} the memes, exploits, and hijackings of [subterranean
cyberconflicts]{.underline} and whose reconstitution as data-subjects
habituated to ceaseless state and commercial surveillance constitutes
the inevitable accompaniment to such operations.

Surveying this field, we can say that military mobilization has not so
much been abolished from cyberwar as reconfigured in subterranean,
etiolated, and unfamiliar forms. This decomposition of the labor of war,
equivalent to Virilio's state of "**[endocolonization]{.underline}**"
[by the apparatus of high-technology militarism]{.underline},
[may]{.underline}, as we have proposed in this chapter, [contain
potentials for **reversal**]{.underline}. If, to date, cyberwar is not,
at least in the centers of capitalism, producing the massive havoc of
earlier forms of war, the migrant refugees of hybrid conflicts around
the world, fleeing algorithmically directed drones, social
media--activated death squads, and cybernetic strikes at social
utilities, bear witness to its potential to do so.
[Already]{.underline}, [even in ostensibly secure zones of the
planet]{.underline}, [the costs of militarized and criminalized
networks]{.underline}, [in terms of **escalating social
paranoias**]{.underline}, [**crumbling confidence** in everyday
communication and **polarizing social relations**]{.underline}, [becomes
daily more apparent]{.underline}. [If this]{.underline} course
[persists]{.underline}, [**unforeseen forms of unrest** by the new
workforces of cyberwar may **interrupt** its inhuman
trajectory]{.underline}.

#### Plan-focused debates replicate the folly of the Tallinn Manual by attempting to apply liberal technological literacy to a problem that has [outpaced liberalism itself]{.underline}. The formation of governable stacks begins [not]{.underline} with the question of how security cooperation over cybersecurity "should" occur, but what "is" cybersecurity and how it came to be that way in the first place.

**Gray and Eloff, 22**---School of Philosophy at North-West University
(Chantelle and Aragorn, "Fabulation in a Time of Algorithmic Ecology:
Making the Future Possible Again," *Technology, Urban Space and the
Networked Community*, Chapter 5, 105-133, SpringerLink, dml)

In his 2008 article, "The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the
Scientific Method Obsolete", Wired editor Chris Anderson notoriously
argues that the era of the scientific method built around testable
hypotheses is fast-becoming obsolete due to the advent of
"petabyte-scale" data accumulation and analytics. Observing that tech
companies like Google treat this "massive corpus as a laboratory of the
human condition" (Anderson 2008), Anderson polemically implores us to
forget every theory of human behaviour, from linguistics and sociology
to ontology and psychology. "With enough data", he avers, "the numbers
speak for themselves" (ibid.), and statistical correlation renders
superfluous any theorisation of causality. The Californian Ideology
(Barbrook and Cameron 1996)1 implicit in this overstatement of the
benefits of data-driven research has been challenged by several
commentators (see, e.g., Pigliucci 2009 and Mazzocchi 2015) and is
patently specious. [The appeal]{.underline} made by Silicon Valley
zealots [to]{.underline} '**[pay no attention to the man behind the
curtain]{.underline}**' [relies on a **mythical**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} sometimes even **[eschatologically
feverish]{.underline}**, [conception of science as a **purely
objective** pursuit]{.underline}, [as well as a **facile conception** of
human]{.underline} thought and behaviour---indeed,
[subjectivity]{.underline}---[wherein we can be **comprehensively
understood** via]{.underline} the [purely quantitative
approaches]{.underline} of Big Data analyses [and]{.underline} the
[statistical aggregation]{.underline} of deep learning systems. As
Louise Amoore underscores in Cloud Ethics, [this ideology confronts
our]{.underline} "[fallible]{.underline}, [intractable]{.underline},
[fraught political world with]{.underline} a curious kind of
**[infallibility]{.underline}**. In the cloud, [the promise is that
everything can be rendered **tractable**]{.underline}, [all political
difficulty and uncertainty nonetheless **actionable**]{.underline}"
(Amoore 2020, 55). [This dream of **complete**]{.underline} mathematical
and technological [**control** over reality]{.underline}---of "a kind of
atlas of clouds for the ineffable, a condensed trace of the trajectories
of our future lives with one another" (ibid.)---[is hardly
new]{.underline}. What legal theorist Antoinette Rouvroy refers to as
"algorithmic governmentality"2 (Rouvroy and Stiegler 2016, 6), by which
she means "the increasingly statistical governance of the 'real' ensuing
from a convergence of contemporary technological and socio-political
evolutions" (Rouvroy 2011, 119), can be traced at least as far back as
first-order cybernetics (Wiener 1965, 12) and, before that, to Leibniz's
calculus ratiocinator (cf. Couturat 1901). [What makes the contemporary
problem **novel**]{.underline}, however, [is that the latest
technologies]{.underline}, for example cloud computing, practically
unlimited data storage, high-speed global communications networks and,
most importantly, machine learning---and here we mean specifically new
forms of connectionist 'artificial intelligence' that, unlike older
symbolic AI models, rely on multi-layer artificial neural networks that
are assumed to represent the biology of human cognitive
structure---[have **powerfully exacerbated** the quest for]{.underline}
([and assumptions of]{.underline}) '**[Algorithmic
Supremacy]{.underline}**'. As digital technology theorist Dan McQuillan
argues, data-driven modelling via statistical induction is assumed to
bear inherent significance, but this approach, which McQuillan describes
as a form of "machinic Neoplatonism" (McQuillan 2018), tends to entirely
elide the broader subjective and inter-subjective contexts within which
analyses and modelling unfold [and is thus]{.underline}, via this
unwarranted delimitation, [able to present itself as operating with a
level of mathematical objectivity it **simply does not
possess**]{.underline}.

This creates several insidious problems. For one, as Bernard Steigler
observes in The Age of Disruption, [this deferral to]{.underline} the
'superiority' of [algorithmic reason legitimises]{.underline} "the
**[systematic exploitation]{.underline}** and physical reticulation of
interindividual and transindividual relations" in the service of the
data economy (Stiegler 2019, 7). In other words, [the]{.underline} kinds
of transgenerational, intergenerational, interpersonal, personal and
even pre-personal3 [circuits that used to]{.underline} "[emerge through
**affective relations**]{.underline} of various kinds" over time within
and across societies [to forge]{.underline} "**[dreams]{.underline}**,
**[goals]{.underline}**, [**objectives** and **common
horizons**]{.underline}" [have been **disrupted** in unprecedented
ways]{.underline} (ibid., 16). Rouvroy argues, in fact, that
[subjectivity is **bypassed** by contemporary digital automisation so
that subjects are rendered **little more** than a]{.underline}
"[collection of]{.underline} infraindividual **[data]{.underline}**"
that are "recomposed at a supra-individual level under the form of
profile" (Rouvroy and Stiegler 2016, 12). Second, the speed at which
what we have elsewhere termed the Algocene4 has emerged, as well as [the
level of **technological literacy** a coherent understanding of this
shift entails]{.underline}, [has **far exceeded** our capacity to
theorise its effects]{.underline}, with the result that [many
analyses]{.underline} of our contemporary condition [remain **trapped in
anachronism**]{.underline}, [projecting the image of an **old world**
and its struggles onto a **new**]{.underline} and largely **[alien
terrain]{.underline}**. It is perhaps not too hyperbolic to claim, as
many have, that the staggering technological shifts of the last 20-odd
years necessitate theoretical engagement on the scale of a new
geological era or epoch. [This is **no longer** the world of
**industrial capitalism**]{.underline}, nor even of Foucault's
disciplinary societies (Foucault 1977), Deleuze's control societies
(Deleuze 1992) or Guattari's Integrated World Capitalism (Guattari
2000), although these are all vestigially inflected in the new
situation, which has variously, although far from exhaustively, been
termed societies of hyper-control and computational capitalism (Stiegler
2019), cognitive capitalism (Yann Moulier-Boutang 2012), platform
capitalism (Srnicek 2016), the age of planetary computerisation
(Guattari 2013), The Stack (Bratton 2015), infopolitics (Koopman 2018),
instrumentarianism (Zuboff 2019) and algorithmic governmentality
(Rouvroy and Berns 2013). Third, because of the speed at which digital
innovation operates, whatever effects this new "hyper-synchronization of
consciousness" (Vignola 2017, 188) is having on subjectivity can only be
perceived in the most miniscule of ways, yet we have to rely on this
minimum of information for a symptomatology because, if we follow
Deleuze via Nietzsche, it is only through a symptomatology that we can
trace etiological factors in order to find the most inventive corrective
therapy. A difficult task indeed considering the constraints we are
outlining here! The point is, [we **urgently require new tools** to
grapple with the implications of the encroachment of algorithmic reason
and governmentality into **more** and **more aspects** of our lives and
minds]{.underline}. [Far from **eschewing** theory]{.underline} in
favour of the transcendent mathesis universalis of our new digital
overlords, [situated thinking about our times has **never been more
crucial**]{.underline}. If, however, this kind of thinking has not been
forthcoming to the extent we would hope for, then this too perhaps forms
part of the symptomatology of the Algocene. In describing something that
is unprecedented, [we need to take care]{.underline}, as McKenzie Wark
argues, [to find]{.underline} "[a renewed language for **describing**
the present situation and **identifying** what in the received
language]{.underline} of capitalism \[or, for those further behind the
times, Marxism\] [**impedes** forward movement]{.underline} in thought
and action" (Wark 2019, 6). Having said this, we also hold [that it is
important **not** to reduce the entire social field to algorithmic
control]{.underline}, despite its near-ubiquity. [What is]{.underline}
rather [**vital** is to understand what this new way of experiencing
subjectivity **produces** and what]{.underline}, in turn, **[produces
it]{.underline}**. As Guattari explains of the Freudian Unconscious, it
produced new desires, which included "hysteria, infantile neurosis,
psychosis, family conflict, the reading of myths, etc." (Guattari 1995,
10). So too what Stiegler refers to as "negative collective protention",
or the nihilistic expectation of nothing, except perhaps The End
(Stiegler 2019, 19, 50), has produced new desires, and here [we have to
seriously consider that **The End**]{.underline} might in
fact---probably [is]{.underline}---**[desired]{.underline}**, even
**[collectively]{.underline}** so (especially given that we also face
Anthropogenic doom).5

[How]{.underline}, then, [do we **change** this desire]{.underline}?
[How do we use the **diagnostic tools** at our disposal]{.underline} in
the schizoanalytic mode---that is, a therapeutic mode---[to produce
something **new**]{.underline}, something healthier? [How do we change
our **practices** and **ways of being**]{.underline} in the world [so
that **life**]{.underline}---[rather than]{.underline} a misguided idea
of **[Algorithmic Supremacy]{.underline}**---**[matters]{.underline}**
again? In this chapter, we attempt to give a broad symptomatology of
algorithmic subjectivity, drawing on a range of scholars who have gone
before us. [Our aim]{.underline}, diverging from most theorists,
however, is **[not to propose legal]{.underline}** or other
**[reforms]{.underline}**. [We understand the algorithm to already
present itself as an **ethicopolitical arrangement** of
values]{.underline}, [assumptions and propositions about the
world]{.underline}. [Our question]{.underline}---yes, our desire---[is
**not**]{.underline}: [How **ought** the algorithm be arranged for a
good society?]{.underline} [but rather]{.underline}: [What **is** a good
society?]{.underline} For [it is from the **latter**]{.underline}
question, we hold, [that **healthier algorithmic arrangements** will
flow]{.underline}, **[not the other way around]{.underline}**.

## Case

### AT: Communication=Possible

#### Cybernetics has robbed meaning of its stability.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko 19**(Nick and Svitlana, Associate
professor at the University of Western Ontario, Professor of
Communications at Simon Fraser University "Cyberwar and Revolution",
Chapter Two, CS)

[There is no longer a Master-Signifier that stabilizes meaning, that
knits together the chain of signifiers and hinders their tendencies to
float off into indeterminacy. While the absence of such a master might
seem to produce a situation of complete openness and freedom---no
authority is telling the subject what to do, what to desire, how to
structure its choices]{.underline}---Žižek argues [that in fact the
result is unbearable, suffocating closure]{.underline}. A "[setting of
electronically mediated subjectivity \[that\] is one of infinite doubt
and ultimate reflexifisation" intensifies "the fundamental uncertainty
accompanying the impossibility of totalization]{.underline}" in a
symbolic environment where "there is always another option, link,
opinion, nuance or contingency that we haven't taken into account" (Dean
2014, 212). [Computational propaganda that aims to mystify invasions and
occupations, or promote cynical disaffection from an adversary's
political system, actively weaponizes the "decline in symbolic
efficiency," but it is endemic to the whole field of
cyberwar]{.underline}. The extreme uncertainty and opacity of cyberwar
do not, however, inhibit the interpellative effects of contending
cyberwar apparatuses as they summon up cybersoldiers, patriotic hackers,
vigilante militias, and security-conscious digital citizens. On the
contrary, [the problems of verifying or disproving multiple alarms and
accusations accelerates these processes and puts them into overdrive. To
put this point in psychoanalytic terms,]{.underline} as we noted
previously, commentators on Althusser have criticized the appropriation
of Lacan's theories of the subject in his account of ISAs. These critics
point out that what Althusser misses in Lacan's account is that [the
subject is always incomplete; it is precisely what can never be fixed by
a specific subject position or identity. However, the implication of
this incompletion is not that the subject remains some untouched and
primordial haven of authenticity but rather that this lack drives to
ever more compulsive (because unfulfillable) attempts to attain a
definitive identity]{.underline}. Translating this into political
terms[, we would say that it is the inescapably incomplete, provisional,
and easily falsified nature of all accounts of cyberwar that energizes
the adoption of increasingly militarized, extreme, paranoid, and
unshakable subject positions vis-à-vis its alleged events.]{.underline}

### AT: Global Cybernetics Inevitable

#### The US is key to global cybernetic expansion:

#### Epistemologically.

[Increasingly]{.underline}, [there is]{.underline} also [a **merger** of
political power and tech power in the **US**]{.underline}, [which is
then **extrapolated** to the rest of the world]{.underline}. [A
**handful of huge corporations**]{.underline}, like Amazon Web Services
and Palantir, [have built a]{.underline} '**[revolving
door]{.underline}**' [to **develop** and **entrench** Silicon Valley's
capacity to **expand** their services abroad]{.underline}.19 [The
neocolonial role of international aid takes a **new
shape**]{.underline}, this time [as **technology**]{.underline}, [as the
revolving door between the most powerful governments in the world and
technology companies manifests in global diplomacy]{.underline}. [The
CEOs of tech companies navigate the world as]{.underline} '**[new
envoys]{.underline}**' [of **digital colonialism**]{.underline} --
[**diplomats** showcasing the power of their **enormous technical
empires** to heads of state]{.underline}. Often, [their revenues are
larger than the **entire GDP** of their countries they are
visiting]{.underline}, [and their arrival sends a **distorted message**
of prosperity and progress to **overcome** systemic inequalities and
**leapfrog** into a better future]{.underline}. For many precarious and
debt-fuelled governments, it is difficult to reject offers of 'free'
digital infrastructure and services. In addition, [current global trade
rules run the risk of consolidating a regime **favourable to digital
empires**]{.underline}, [**blocking** the possibility of smaller actors
to]{.underline} innovate and [**take ownership** of their digital
futures]{.underline}.

#### Infrastructurally.

**Avila, 20**---former Non-Resident Fellow at the Digital Civil Society
Lab in Partnership with the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity at Stanford University (Renata, "Against Digital Colonialism,"
<https://autonomy.work/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Avila.pdf>, dml)

Early manifestations of this process can be seen in the 'free' provision
of critical infrastructure -- from cables to [connectivity]{.underline}
-- to large populations. This process [led to the **silent
privatisation** of the digital infrastructure of **entire
nations**]{.underline}.7 [Big Tech CEOs]{.underline} were meeting heads
of state, shaking hands and promising alliances for a connected future.8
The most audacious even [used **Washington** as a **backdoor** to reach
places like **North Korea**]{.underline}, [**Cuba** and
**China**]{.underline}.9 [Some nations even opened **tech embassies** in
Silicon Valley]{.underline}, [signalling their availability to **tech
companies**]{.underline}, [which **increasingly behaved like states**
who provided]{.underline} "**[aid]{.underline}**" [and well-intentioned
efforts to **digitise** countries through free infrastructure and
services]{.underline}.10 This included proposals to build broadband
cables and spread connectivity in remote areas using balloons.11 What
started as an aggressive public relations campaign around 2013 has
continued discreetly by the five leading tech companies in developing
countries across the world, particularly in Africa.

The accelerated penetration of tech companies in emerging markets has
taken place not only via generous offers of connectivity and
infrastructure to populations. [Tech giants have]{.underline} also [been
providing digital infrastructure to **dozens** of
governments]{.underline}, [ranging from cloud services to entire mail
and office suites]{.underline}. Amazon and Microsoft have led this
process, followed closely by Facebook and Google. The fact that an
entire nation delegates its digital services to a company based in
Silicon Valley is alarming. The company is then in a position to handle
not only highly sensitive government documents, but also is in
possession of critical information relating to the entire country.

But national security advisors, parliaments and watchdogs remain largely
silent about this new form of dependency aside from a few notable cases
where sanctions and political pressure have been deployed. This has
included the case of Microsoft providing services to Russian firms;12
Iranian users unable to get security updates from US-based products and
services;13 and even deleted accounts on services as vital as GitHub, a
platform which hosts code for developers. [This is an **important
reflection** on the fragility of a tech industry **highly dependent** on
a **US-based ecosystem** of products and services]{.underline}, which
becomes vulnerable to political vendettas, national security letters and
collaboration with security services.14

CRITICISM OF ARMS, ARMS OF CRITICISM [Our project requires an analysis
in terms very different from those of official discussions of
cyberwar]{.underline}, and its echoes in the media, [discussions often
cast in a language that assumes and imposes the inescapable necessity of
a technocratic realpolitik and prepares and armors its audiences for
trajectories of mounting crisis.]{.underline} Just as, in previous
decades[, we were habituated to apocalyptic prospects by an anodyne
"nukespeak," so today we are being trained to a more creeping
catastrophe by a militarized "cyberspeak]{.underline}" [that promises us
resilience against hostile intrusion through social media service
upgrades, improved smartphones, and the steady surrender of individual
and social freedoms to enhanced powers of the security
forces]{.underline}. [This numbing discourse must be broken open and
defamiliarized. The topic of cyberwar has, however, largely been ignored
by critical social theorists, sometimes where one would least
expect.]{.underline} [The most ambitious]{.underline} and sophisticated
of all recent [scholarly attempts to conceptualize the
scope]{.underline} and depth [of the internet as a technosocial
institution]{.underline} [is]{.underline} in our opinion Benjamin
[Bratton's]{.underline} (2016) [The Stack]{.underline}: On Software and
Sovereignty. For Bratton, [**the concept of a "stack**"]{.underline} (in
computer science, a collection of data elements that must be accessed in
a specific order[) **provides a metaphor for the architecture of the
internet, envisaged as a layered series of terrestrial, platform,**
urban, communication, **interface**, and user operations.]{.underline}
[The combined interactions of **these different digital
levels**]{.underline}, Bratton argues, **[now compose an "accidental
megastructure" of global governance either destabilizing or reinforcing
the spatial and temporal boundaries of the nation-state]{.underline}**.
[Yet what is striking is **the limited attention** **this** otherwise
comprehensive, virtuoso **examination of digital networks gives to**
that most **sovereign of activities, war, and the possibility** **of**
what Bratton]{.underline} (2016, 298) [glancingly refers to as "**Stack
versus Stack**" conflicts, a topic that he defers as a matter for later
study]{.underline}. This is all the more surprising because, as [Bratton
acknowledges]{.underline} in a footnote, th[e modeling of the internet
as a "stack" of technosocial activities was pioneered within U.S.
cyberwar agencies with very nonaccidental strategic agendas]{.underline}
(441n8). One of the NSA documents released by Snowden, "[Bad Guys Are
Everywhere, Good Guys Are Somewhere]{.underline}" (Risen and Poitras
2013; Müller-Maguhn 2014), [contains a diagram of the architecture of
the internet in terms of an interdependent "stack" of geographical,
physical network, logical, cyberpersona, and persona levels, derived
from the work of national security intellectual Paul
Rosenzweig]{.underline} (2012). The diagram is defined as a tool that
enables the NSA to conceive how to scan and disrupt the operations of
antagonists at multiple levels: "[the stack" is a concept for cyberwar
fighting. No account of networked sovereigns and subjects can now
postpone reckoning with this reality, so we hope that our book can
supplement Bratton's, even though it is written in a different political
register]{.underline}

### AT: Stack=Bad Metaphor

#### Hate to say it, but not our Stack---we [reclaim]{.underline} the metaphor via [stacktivism]{.underline}.

**Lovink, 20**---founder of the Institute of Network Cultures at the
Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Geert, "Principles of
Stacktivism," tripleC 18 (2): 716-724, 2020, dml)

Lately, [the concept of]{.underline} "**[the stack]{.underline}**", once
a technical insider term used amongst engineers and geeks\[10\],
[has]{.underline} jumped context and [**transformed** into a **general
container concept**]{.underline}, [in **danger** of becoming an **empty
signifier**]{.underline}. [As a **meta-concept** The Stack has
been]{.underline} detached from its author and his Californian-nihilist
program for the aspirational cool-crowd and [turned into a **symbol**
for the need to bring together interrelated crises]{.underline}, from
climate change, inequality, AI and automation to covid-19. In Bratton's
world, you sign up from the program and carry the card, otherwise the
entry sign points to exit. No affect, behavioural noise or regional
ambiguities please -- **[we're performing Important Theory
here]{.underline}**. Perhaps this is a form of group therapy for the
insecure? That's fine if you like the taste of testosterone in your milk
shake.

[This is the time to design]{.underline} one, two, three, indeed
[**many** stacks and **not to dismiss**]{.underline} the [ambitious
efforts]{.underline} of others because, after all, where are the
European antidotes to Bratton or Zuboff? Europe tragically fails in the
production of contemporary reference texts, both at the speculative and
the critical level. While the late Bernard Stiegler comes in mind, a lot
of translation work is still to be done in order to transform his
philosophy of technology into workable programs decoupled from his
often-obscure neologisms. For instance, where are the counterproposals
of the crypto-blockchain system? The [Bratton]{.underline} bible,
written in the quasi-authoritarian voice of a Master Designer,
[can]{.underline} also [be read from a **grass-roots perspective** and
should be **praised** for its multi-disciplinary analysis of
techno-social]{.underline} (power) [practices]{.underline}. Why not be
ambitious? There's a lot at stake. As a proposal, Bratton's reading of
The Stack should be compared to Dante's hell, Sloterdijk's notion of the
spheres, Deleuze and Guattari's Mille plateaux, Hui's cosmotechnics and
Stiegler's The Age of Disruption. But instead of conducting hermeneutic
exercises, [the proposal here is to **transplant** the term into the
**hacktivist context** and define the principles of]{.underline}
"**[stacktivism]{.underline}**": dancing stacks\[11\].

#### Stack design is a useful metaphor.

**Crombie et al. 21**(David, Canadian politician, professor and
consultant, "Rethinking the Stack: New Narratives for an Era of
Collective Intelligences", 12.1, CS)

[We are neither coders nor engineers but driven by a shared sense that
the scope and speed of technological change has literally implicated us
-- folded us -- in the workings of distributed intelligent systems that
affect how we relate, speak, work]{.underline}. It is this
transformation of our own agency we wish to comprehend, and the
emergence of collective intelligences that bring human and non-human
agency together in new constellations. [While we realize that "stack
design" is an abstract design proposition, we want to build on the
technical metaphor of the stack as a layered system to facilitate a more
holistic systems design conversation -- and find out more about the role
each of us might play in that process.]{.underline} Stacks are generally
defined as "the set of technologies an organization uses to build a web
or mobile application \... a combination of programming languages,
frameworks, libraries, patterns, servers, UI/UX solutions, software, and
tools used by its developers".2 A quick look at [the stacks used by key
players in and across the platform economy suggests that these
modularized systems have more in common than their fierce competition
for users might suggest]{.underline}. Rather than repeating the usual
invocations of global brands (and their market power), [we want to shift
the focus of our conversation to the stacks that sustain the power of
these actors -- a first step toward a more comprehensive understanding
of the relational infrastructures behind data-driven
societies]{.underline}, what we have termed the condition of
distribution, [and a different way of thinking]{.underline} about the
design of (fairer) markets [for a more cooperative
economy]{.underline}.3 Adopting the principle that [technology stacks
are in principle subject to codesign]{.underline}, we showcase a series
of complementary co-design processes to explore how we might best
facilitate such a conversation. In these examples, we focus on the role
of data -- from the data monetization controversy (data-as-right vs data
as-commodity) to "platform" cooperatives adding a digital technology and
data governance layer to the much older organizational practices of the
cooperative. We do not, however, assume a comprehensive understanding of
data governance approaches. [Our invitation to join the "stack
design]{.underline}" conversation [begins with a much simpler idea --
the search for a narrative]{.underline} (with a wide range of characters
and multiple conflicting plots) [that might be able to frame a
cross-sectoral systems design conversation in which many actors see a
role for themselves]{.underline}. So before we turn to technology, we
define our non-technological point of departure, leaving the question of
where exactly to draw the line between the technological and the
non-technological to the side for now. While we are not yet sure what
the scope and structure of such a conversation will be, we do know that
we want such a narrative to allow us to comprehend the condition of
distribution that serves as infrastructural context for the ways in
which we live and work.

### AT: State Key To Solve Cyberwar

#### Stacktivism overcomes divisions, pools information, and develops interconnectivity in order to create a digital commons to combat the new era of technological war

**Lovink 20**(Geert, founding director of the Institute of Network
Cultures, PhD from the University of Melbourne, "Principles of
Stacktivism", CS)

[We need to define new forms of collective action that some call the
commons that is defined by the ability to act together]{.underline}. The
design question here is what comes next after the model of social
networks, which has been so compromised and overshadowed by the social
media monopolies. [This is a digital commons in which collective forms
of money is included, a redistribution of wealth that has been produced
together and should never again be allowed to be expropriated. We need
to collectivise our knowledge]{.underline} and learn from the mistakes
that were made in projects such as Wikipedia and Creative Commons, [but
also of the self-centric notion of free software]{.underline} as
promoted by Richard Stallman, who could only think in terms of
individual freedom of the singleuser- as-programmer -- until his 2019
downfall. What Bratton's static metaphysical view in particular lacks is
the role of actors (and their interests, ideologies). Instead of
trashing the stack, [the proposition here is to make the model more
dynamic (or dialectical) by introducing stackivism]{.underline}. Let's
define [stacktivism as a form of Internet activism that no longer
bothers with the distractive nois]{.underline}e on social media channels
[and dares to dig deeper in order to make a real difference.
I]{.underline}nstead of talking only about upload filters, fake news or
the deployment of cheap online moderation armies, we are working on a
next Internet. The charm of protocol driven direct action or
[stacktivism is that it goes both up (from network to platform to stack)
and down (protocols, data centres, cables), at the same
time.]{.underline} The Internet is more than social media, more than you
and your app. This may sound like a simple, self-evident slogan but the
integral practice-based vision of [stacktivism is a promising one,
beyond techno-solutionism and it critics, the liberal-tech engineering
status quo procedures, the discontent offline romanticism, liberal
privacy concerns, legalistic NGO approaches and the after-the-fact
Academic Truth that confines itself to the closed monads of peer-review
journals]{.underline}. Stacktivism embodies Adorno's critique of
totality as a lie while climbing up the abstraction ladder in order to
enjoy the view. Digitisation Takes Command. The stacktivist dilemma is a
classic one: [How can the multitudes gain power while pulverizing power
at the same time? The digital is now an encompassing global sphere. Is
this dark enlightenment in action?]{.underline} In this light, how
should we judge the Will to Stack? Dare to think in term of political
strategies when talking about cosmotechnics (or cosmic networks, for
that matter). We've left the era of technology-as-tool far behind us.
[The nasty feedback machines strike back and try to corner us,
suppressing our desires and needs, even without us noticing the closing
down of communication and expression]{.underline}. Can The Stack
(formerly known as the Internet) only be understood in its totality once
it has fallen from its unity and been reduced to fragments (read:
geo-political blocks and national webs)? [Can we be global in scope on
the protocol level, yet act locally in networks of strong-ties? Is it
worth to think of cosmotechnics-for-good? Stealing code from the rich
and inserting into networks of the poor]{.underline}, in the spirit of
Aaron Schwartz and Anonymous' SkyNet? Do you still believe that another
WikiLeaks is possible, beyond the focus on celebrity? [**Let's upgrade
and broaden the vision how the** **fight against moral injustices could
look like in the age of geo-political cyberwarfare** **and attacks on
our critical infrastructure, not just the Internet but water, gas,
electricity,** **bridges and hospitals. These are The Stacks of the
People, and we'll better not be naïve about their vulnerability. We
depend on The Stack. Making visible and defending critical public
infrastructure could be one of the many tasks of
stacktivism**]{.underline}. This leaves us with the question how to
organise strategic forecasting in times of collapse. How can we bring
together new forms of collective intelligence that are truly planetary
in nature, which is to say conflictual and variegated, and not merely
designed to replicate Western policy production? [Call them organised
networks or think tanks, we're gathering in a closed forum, on Telegram,
Mastodon or Signal in order to get **t**hings done, overcoming the
divisions that aren't ours. In theory we have all the communication
skills, tools and ideas, yet we often do not know how to organise
ourselves outside of surveillance capitalism and state
control]{.underline}. Ni Zuckerberg, ni Xi Jinping19. How can we
redistribute critical resources and talents? The need to bring together
different and messy idioms of knowledge (technical, spiritual, cultural,
political) is widely felt. [What we will do next is act, together. What
we need are simple, appealing images, models that bring people together
to act.]{.underline}

### AT: Tallinn Manual Good

#### The Tallinn Manual is an [ethical]{.underline} and [juridical failure]{.underline}.

**Barrett 17**(Edward, Ethics professor in the Department of Leadership,
Ethics and Law, "On the Relationship Between the Ethics and the Law of
War: Cyber Operations and Sublethal Harm", CS)

To begin, [the manual's purely legalistic
assumptions]{.underline}---derived from applicable treaties and
customary international law---[can generate ethically problematic
definitions of just cause]{.underline}. Functionally, Article's concept
of armed attack and the ethical concept of just cause are the same: they
define a casus belli to which one may justifiably respond with lethal
defensive force. But the related [legal definitions]{.underline} of
"uses of force" and "armed attacks" can---from an ethical
perspective---[lead to both overly permissive and overly restrictive
conclusions]{.underline}. Following international law, the manual
defines uses of force as acts "that injure or kill persons or damage or
destroy objects." Those of sufficient "scale and effects" are deemed
armed attacks. On the one hand, this framework can be too permissive
vis-à-vis property. Ethically speaking, [large-scale property
destruction and damage do not in themselves justify lethal defensive
harm;]{.underline} the property in question must be lifesustaining, and
this prerequisite is not intrinsic to the definition of armed attack. On
the other hand, this framework can be too restrictive vis-à-vis persons.
From an ethical perspective, one may respond to unjustified and culpable
threats to life with lethal force if necessary; the scale of death is
irrelevant. While legally limiting forceful responses to cases of armed
attack--level fatalities might promote utility, [it also might
contravene the moral right of self-defense.]{.underline} This problem
accounts for the "contrary view" of the United States following the
International Court of Justice's Nicaragua judgment, which asserted that
"any illegal use of force can qualify as an armed attack triggering the
right of self-defense; there is no gravity threshold distinguishing
illegal uses of force from armed attacks[." In addition to being
simultaneously overly permissive and restrictive, legal definitions of
just cause can also be arbitrary because of the way in which judgments
are made]{.underline}. What counts as harm sufficient to rise to the
level of an armed attack is determined through practice, which in
reality can mean that [the definitions of stronger parties will
prevail]{.underline}. [Reliance on international law therefore does
little to discourage wars initiated by the powerful in defense of
"national interests" that merely support a desired standard of
living.]{.underline} A dialogue between ethics and international law
thus serves to provide necessary critiques of self-serving legal
interpretations of both kinetic and cyber operations. A second ad
bellum-related flaw in the manual involves the relationship between
culpability and just cause. In assessments of whether an armed attack
has occurred, the experts were "divided over the issue of whether the
effects in question must have been intended." The minority of experts
asserted that espionage "unexpectedly result\[ing\] in significant
damage" should not be considered an armed attack. On the other hand, the
majority concluded that "intention is irrelevant in qualifying an
operation as an armed attack and that only scale and effects matter."
According to their analysis, victims of unintentional grave harm would
possess a right to respond in kind, if necessary. But from an ethical
perspective, on the relationship between the ethics and the law of war
majority's position is erroneous. Culpable acts are those done
intentionally, freely, and with knowledge or vincible ignorance of the
relevant normative and empirical facts; and only culpable murderous acts
compromise one's capacity for justice and dignity to the degree required
to forfeit one's right to life and incur liability to lethal defensive
harm. [Although the response advocated by the manual's majority would be
excused if the victim were unable to know that the act was unintended,
the response would still not be justified.]{.underline} Third, the
discussion of ad bellum proportionality is problematic primarily because
it misunderstands the criterion, which requires that the total expected
good caused by a war outweighs the total expected harm. Instead, [the
manual asserts that the issue at hand is "how much force . . . is
permissible once force is deemed necessary"]{.underline} (that is, once
last resort has been satisfied), and concludes that the proportionality
criterion limits this amount to "that required to end the situation that
has given rise to the right to act in self-defense." In other words,
[the manual stipulates that the ad bellum criterion of proportionality,
instead of ensuring that the goods at stake are commensurate with
anticipated harms, requires one to use only a necessary amount of force
to put an end to the situation. One can easily imagine a case in which
this leads to massive defensive retaliation to stop a much less harmful
attack.]{.underline} Additionally, the entire analysis is misplaced, as
the imperative to use only necessary amounts of force is an in bello
issue. Fourth, [the manual's treatment of when temporary functionality
losses would qualify as a just cause is self-contradictory. Like kinetic
weapons, cyber weapons can physically destroy or damage computers. But
because of their potential to be transitory or reversible, cyberattacks
can also merely compromise functionality]{.underline}. While permanent
losses of functionality can create the same effect as physical
destruction, temporary functionality losses are unique to cyber
operations and require additional analysis. Part of the manual's
discussion on functionality occurs in the in bello section that defines
a cyberattack. Associating attacks on objects with damage or
destruction, the majority asserted that interference with functionality
would qualify as damage and thus constitute a use of force only if
"restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical
components." Accordingly, a transitory or reversible loss of function
not requiring the replacement of physical components would constitute
neither an attack nor, by extension, a just cause. But elsewhere in the
manual some experts argue that actions not resulting in physical damage
would qualify as an armed attack if the ensuing negative effects
were---although others still maintain that direct "harm to persons or
physical damage to property" is a precondition for an armed attack[.
Ethically speaking, justified responses would be a function of both an
attack's culpability and overall effects. Assuming culpability, a
temporary loss of the functionality of a system that was not physically
damaged would be a casus belli if the event resulted in
death,]{.underline} for example, in the event of the temporary disabling
of an air traffic control system that caused mass casualties. Fifth,
from an ethical perspective, although the manual's treatment of in bello
proportionality is excellent, it could be improved in one way: Since
civilians on both sides retain all of their rights, one should not
dismiss consequences such as loss of email or banking services from
collateral damage calculations. Of course, such costs could be awarded
relatively low values. Sixth and finally, [the manual unfortunately
adopts a purely legal approach to targeting nonparticipating
civilians]{.underline}, arguing that cyber operations that do not
qualify as "uses of force"---ones that merely inconvenience---may be
intentionally directed against civilian objects such as computers.
Interference with functionality is permitted if physical repair or
operating system reinstallation is not required. Data, related or
unrelated to functionality, is also targetable. Large-scale email
blockage also does not qualify as an attack. Additionally, and as
mentioned earlier, none of these harms need to be minimized or
considered in collateral damage proportionality assessments. That these
conclusions follow logically from their premises demonstrates the danger
of purely legal approaches. From an ethical perspective, [intentionally
harming civilians, in addition to usually being strategically
ineffective, is unjust. In peacetime or wartime, persons who have not
culpably transgressed the rights of others have forfeited none of their
own, and are not liable to any degree of harm---not even the
inconveniences described above.]{.underline} Accordingly, domestic and
international statutes should define these injustices as punishable
crimes, and appropriate executive and legislative oversight should be
implemented. And if nonparticipating civilians are to be affected by
cyber operations before or during war, these effects must be minimized
and weighed in the ways currently associated with, respectively,
economic sanctions and dual-use objects.

## Alternative Methods/Theses

### Mediation

#### We begin our analysis at the [medium]{.underline}, the aesthetic space that separates the human from the nonhuman world. Cybernetics has changed the altered the field of our [medialogical relationship]{.underline} with the world around us. Our desires, fears, affects, are embedded within the network of the [technosphere]{.underline} -- In the face of this we look to *[radical mediation]{.underline}*. We look to the middle. To the [infinite, chaotic, flux of the world]{.underline} as a lens imbued with radical potential. This radical aesthetic dwells in the gap between [subject and object]{.underline}, [individual and milieu]{.underline}. Only through this interjection can we move to openness and dismantle the cybernetic drive towards [complete interconnectivity.]{.underline}

**Grusin 2015** (Richard Grusin, English, University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, "Radical Mediation") //ansel

**[I develop the concept of radical mediation in order to]{.underline}
[make related but independent arguments about the dualistic character of
mediation in Western thought]{.underline}**. I argue that although
[media and **media technologies have operated and continue to operate
epistemologically as modes of knowledge production**, th**ey also
function technically, bodily, and materially to generate and modulate
individual and collective affective moods or structures of feeling among
assemblages of humans and nonhumans**]{.underline}.6 [This affective
mediation of collective human and nonhuman assemblages operates
independently of (and often more efficaciously than) the production of
knowledge]{.underline}.7 [Like the way media operate affectively,
mediation must also be understood ontologically as a process or event
prior to and ultimately not reducible to particular media
technologies]{.underline}. [Mediation operates physically and materially
as an object, event, or process in the world, impacting humans and
nonhumans alike]{.underline}. [Radical mediation participates in recent
critiques of the dualism of the Western philosophical tradition, which
make up what I have elsewhere called the nonhuman turn]{.underline} in
twenty-first-century studies.8 Indeed, as I suggest in the essay's final
sections, [radical mediation might in some sense be understood as
nonhuman mediation]{.underline}. I derive the term radical mediation
from the concept of radical empiricism set forth by William James in
Essays in Radical Empiricism, published in 1912, two years after his
death.9 James's [radical empiricism has been redeployed]{.underline} in
recent books by Adrian Mackenzie and Anna Munster in order [to make
sense of the technical and embodied experience of our current media
environment]{.underline}, what Mackenzie calls "[wirelessness"
and]{.underline} Munster characterizes as [the "anaesthesia of
networks]{.underline}."10 Both books start from James's paradigmatic
definition of radical empiricism in "A World of Pure Experience": To be
radical, an empiricism must neither admit into its constructions any
element that is not directly experienced, nor exclude from them any
element that is directly experienced. For such a philosophy, the
relations that connect experiences must themselves be experienced
relations, and any kind of relation experienced must be accounted as
'real' as anything else in the system. 1

[**In developing** the concept of **radical empiricism James means to
reject both the empiricism or realism that starts with objects or the
real in itself and the rationalism or idealism that sees the real as an
imperfect manifestation of a universal logos or spirit**. **In so doing
he also means to insist on the affectivity of relations and the reality
of affect**]{.underline}, in a way that I take as consonant with the
famous claim in The Principles of Psychology that [we do not cry because
we are sad but we are sad because we cry]{.underline}.12 For James
"[ordinary empiricism," despite "the fact that conjunctive and
disjunctive relations present themselves as being fully co-ordinate
parts of experience, has always shown a tendency to do away with the
connections of things, and to insist most on the
disjunctions]{.underline}." On the other hand, [rationalism, to counter
empiricism's dismissal of relations, has sought "to correct its
incoherencies by the addition of trans-experiential agents of
unification, substances, intellectual categories and powers, or
Selves]{.underline}."13 [James's alternative to the debate between
empiricists and rationalists suggests a promising way to move past
current debates about objects and relations, or ontology and
politics]{.underline}. [Object-oriented ontologists like Graham Harman
insist on the disjunction between objects]{.underline}, [their
"withdrawal" from contact with other objects, and thus the separation of
ontology from politics]{.underline}.14 Contemporary and historical
Marxists, not unlike rationalists, introduce "trans-experiential agents
of unification" like capital or capitalism to hold together disparate
and unrelated objects or practices.15 [By starting with experienced
relations, and insisting that "any kind of relation experienced must be
accounted as 'real' as anything else in the system," **James would start
in the middle, in** what he famously called in the 1890 Principles of
Psychology "**the blooming, buzzing confusion" of the
world**]{.underline}.16

With radical mediation I too would start in the middle. [By taking
James's radical empiricism as a source for the concept of radical
mediation, we just need to substitute mediation for "relation" and
immediate for "real" to retain a sense of James's meaning in the new
term]{.underline}: ["the \[mediations\] that connect experiences must
themselves be experienced \[mediations\], and any kind of \[mediation\]
experienced must be accounted as \['immediate'\] as anything else in the
system]{.underline}." [Where James is concerned with the empirical
reality of relations, my concerns start with the immediacy of
mediation]{.underline}. [James describes relations primarily as
connecting experiences. I see mediations as generating, refashioning,
and transforming experiences as well as connecting them, similar to what
Bruno Latour calls "translations" or Karen Barad describes as
"intra-actions]{.underline}."17 [Mediations are always remediations,
which change or translate experiences as well as relating or connecting
them]{.underline}. I substitute mediation for James's relation to
emphasize that while [radical empiricism insists on the reality of
experienced relations]{.underline}, [radical mediation also insists upon
an immediacy that transforms, modulates, or disrupts experienced
relations]{.underline}. [Radical mediation challenges what Barad calls
representationalism: "the belief in the ontological distinction between
representations and that which they purport to represent]{.underline}"
(MU, p. 46). [In these traditional representationalist accounts,
mediation is understood to come between, or in the middle of, already
preformed, preexistent subjects or objects, actants or
entities]{.underline}. [The role of mediation in such accounts is
precisely to connect, or negotiate between, actants, categories, and
events (or subjects and objects]{.underline}), [which would otherwise
have no way of understanding or interacting with one
anothe]{.underline}r. [Especially in post-Hegelian, Marxian thought,
mediation has been opposed to immediacy, functioning as what might be
called an agent of correlation, which filters, limits, constrains, or
distorts an immediate perception or knowledge of the world or the
real]{.underline}.18 [**Mediation** **has** in these accounts **been
understood both as enabling our knowledge of reality** **and as
preventing or making impossible the direct** and immediate **relation
with the world**]{.underline} [that Brian Massumi (and others) insist
upon as a fundamental component of human and nonhuman experience. In
many traditional philosophical accounts **we cannot experience the
world** directly or immediately **because we cannot know the world
without some form of mediation**]{.underline}.

Although Massumi has at times taken issue with the concept of mediation,
I want to follow his claim that "[philosophical thinking must begin\...
immediately in the middle" by suggesting that we understand mediation
itself as a place to begin]{.underline}.19 As articulated in different
ways in the nineteenth- and twentieth-century American tradition by
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Sanders Peirce, or
James, or in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries by Alfred North
Whitehead, Gilbert Simondon, Gilles Deleuze, Massumi, or Barad, where we
begin is immediately in the middle.20 [Mediation should be understood
not as standing between preformed subjects, objects, actants, or
entities but as the process, action, or event that generates or provides
the conditions for the emergence of subjects and objects, for the
individuation of entities within the world]{.underline}. [Mediation is
not opposed to immediacy but rather is itself immediate]{.underline}.
[It names the immediacy of middleness in which we are already living and
moving: "Where do we find ourselves?" Emerson asks]{.underline} in the
opening of his famous essay "Experience" and then answers: "In a series
of which we do not know the extremes, and believe that it has none. [We
wake and find ourselves on a stair]{.underline}; [there are stairs below
us, which we seem to have ascended; there are stairs above us, many a
one, which go upward and out of sight]{.underline}."21 [In asking where
we find ourselves, Emerson is asking where the world and its nonhuman
entities find themselves as well.]{.underline} [In developing the
concept of radical mediation I operate from a sense that where we find
ourselves]{.underline} (both at the beginning of the twenty-first
century and in human and nonhuman history more generally[) is
immediately in the middle, in mediation itself]{.underline}.

[Remediation I have been thinking and writing about the history and
theory of mediation for twenty years---most notably in my work on the
logics of mediation in the late twentieth and early twenty-first
centuries]{.underline}. [I have also been concerned throughout this work
with thinking through in various and partial ways the ontological status
of mediation]{.underline}.22 [In the nearly twenty years since
"Remediation," I have included the ontological and affective reality of
mediation among the methodological premises of my work]{.underline}.23
[Building upon Latour's distinction between intermediaries and
mediators, in which mediators are not neutral means of transmission but
actively involved in transforming whatever they mediate]{.underline}, [I
insist that **mediation** **operates** not by neutrally reproducing
meaning or information but **by actively transforming human and nonhuman
actants**]{.underline}**, [as well as their conceptual and affective
states]{.underline}**. [Thus, the concept of radical mediation helps
make sense of how in the twenty-first century media and mediation
operate within the world as objects or events]{.underline} [no different
from any other and how their contemporary operation lets us see some
things about mediation that have often been obscured. This]{.underline}
[concept of radical mediation departs from the way mediation has been
used in Western thought]{.underline} at least since Immanuel Kant and G.
W. F. Hegel, but more likely going back to Aristotle---although [as a
literary critic turned media theorist, I hesitate in making definitive
assertions about the history of the Western philosophical
tradition]{.underline}. The history of philosophy notwithstanding, [I am
concerned with interrogating the way in which mediation has been
conventionally defined and deployed as a secondary concept or
category]{.underline}, [as something that enters the scene belatedly,
after humans and nonhumans, representation and reality, or culture and
nature have already been divided up and parceled out]{.underline}.

Although [remediation has not always been recognized as doing so, from
very early on I have understood it to be making a case for the
experiential immediacy of mediation]{.underline}. [Perhaps this concern
has not been evident because remediation's double logic divides
immediacy from hypermediacy in a formal sense, having to do with the
visual aesthetics of the screen, its composition and
design]{.underline}. [As half of the double logic of
remediation]{.underline}, [the logic of transparent immediacy imagines a
form of visual mediation in which the medium erases itself so that there
is an immediate subjective encounter with, or apprehension of, the
object of mediation, or the real]{.underline}. [**This visual logic of
transparent immediacy can now be seen as** a version of what, following
the terminology of speculative realism, **we might call media
correlationism, in which mediation functions as the necessary
intermediary between human agents and the nonhuman world**]{.underline}.
[As half of the double logic of remediation, transparent immediacy holds
that **the subject's contact with the real depends upon the erasure of
the medium**]{.underline}, [which correlates **and thereby obscures the
relationship between subject and world**]{.underline}. [Hypermediacy, on
the other hand, refers to the proliferation of media forms and
practices. From a media correlationist standpoint, therefore,
hypermediacy would seem to block or prevent the erasure of the medium
that defines transparent immediacy]{.underline}. [From the perspective
of radical mediation, however, hypermediacy does not prevent immediacy
but rather constitutes it]{.underline}---[not through the erasure of an
intervening visual medium but through the immediacy of mediation
itself]{.underline}. [By using remediation I emphasize the point that
both logics are at play in mediation, that the double logic of
remediation entails both the transparency of media correlationism and
the obscurity of radical mediation, and that these two different
concepts of mediation are just as contradictory as immediacy and
hypermediacy are]{.underline}. [But remediation deploys the concept of
immediacy in another way as well, which moves toward what I am defining
here as radical mediation]{.underline}. [In addition to referring to a
formal style or logic of visual mediation in which all signs of
mediation are erased or concealed**, immediacy is also used in
remediation to refer to the embodied, affective experience that comes
both from the direct encounter with the real provided by transparent
mediation and from the immediate encounter with mediation** provided by
hypermediated modes of mediation]{.underline}. [Remediation tried to
underscore the phenomenal or experiential aspects of mediation by
mobilizing Derrida's argument in "Economimesis" that mimesis is not
about the resemblance between a representation]{.underline} ([or
mediation) and its object, but a relation between "two producing
subjects.]{.underline}"24 [With premediation, I developed the affective
immediacy of mediation further in terms of Maurice MerleauPonty's
contention that the optic is an extension of the haptic, claiming that
because all bodily senses are haptic, mediation is as well (readers of
Marshall McLuhan will undoubtedly hear echoes of his claim that print is
visual, while electric media are haptic)]{.underline}. [As Silvan
Tomkins and Daniel Stern help us to understand, our interactions with
media are always affective, and media themselves can be said to possess
affective lives]{.underline}.25 And [as I have argued elsewhere in
relation to the 2011 Sendai earthquake and its consequent tsunami and
technical catastrophes, **the affectivity of media aftershocks caused by
the quake must be understood to have the same ontological immediacy as
its geotechnical aftershocks**]{.underline}.26 [To understand radical
mediation as affective and experiential rather than strictly visual is
to think about our immediate affective experience of mediation as that
which is felt, embodied, near---not distant from us, and thus not
illuminated or pictured, but experienced by us as living, embodied human
and nonhuman creatures]{.underline}. [Where remediation focused largely
on the visual aspects of mediation, **radical mediation would take into
account the entire human sensorium**]{.underline}**. [For radical
mediation, all bodies (whether human or nonhuman) are fundamentally
media and life itself is a form of mediation]{.underline}**.27 [As
Benjamin had similarly noted about mechanical reproduction, the
remediation of new digital media has worked to bring our media devices
nearer our bodily medium]{.underline}, [engaging us directly in what I
have elsewhere characterized as the affective life of
media]{.underline}.28 [**The core of radical mediation is** its
immanence, immediacy itself---not the transparent immediacy that makes
up half of remediation's double logic but **the embodied immediacy of
the event of mediation**]{.underline}. [In our affective, bodily
interactions with media devices, indeed with the world of humans and
nonhumans, there is no distance or perspective from which to see
immediacy, from which immediacy could be made into something one could
paint or draw or re-present, or something that needed
mediation]{.underline}. "[**Bodies**," writes Barad apropos the
invertebrate brittlestar, "**are not situated in the world**; **they are
part of the world**]{.underline}" (MU, p. 376). Interestingly Emerson
makes a similar point in "Nature" when he includes "all other men and my
own body" under the category of "NATURE" or the "NOT ME."29 [The same
claim, I would aver, can be made for media and mediation as
well]{.underline}. [In theorizing the affective embodiment of radical
mediation, **we should attend to the immediate affective experience of
mediation itself**]{.underline}. [But to suggest that mediation is
immediate is to swim against a strong popular current running through
the history ofWestern thought]{.underline}, [one which would
categorically distinguish mediation from immediacy, a distinction that
both remediation and premediation set out to challenge and that is
further problematized by the concept of radical mediation]{.underline}.

\*modified for gendered language

[As the 21st century unfolds, [a global renewed desire]{.mark} from both
citizens and their respective states [for a tighter control of mobility
is evident]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Wherever we look, the drive is towards
enclosure, or in any case an intensification of the **dialects of
territorialisation** **and deterritorialisation**]{.underline}, [a
dialectics of opening and closure]{.underline}. [**[The belief that the
world would be safer, if only risks]{.mark}**, ambiguity **[and
uncertainty could be controlled]{.mark}**]{.underline} and if only
identities could be fixed once and for all[, **is gaining
momentum**]{.underline}**. [Risk management techniques are increasingly
becoming a means to govern mobilities]{.underline}**. **[In particular
the extent to which the biometric border is extending into multiple
realms, not only of social life, but also of the body, the body that is
not mine.]{.underline}**

[I **would like to pursue [this]{.mark} line of [argument
concern]{.mark}ing [the redistribution of the
earth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Not only through the control of bodies
but the control of movement itself and its corollary,
speed]{.underline}, which is indeed what migration control policies are
all about: controlling bodies, but also movement. More specifically
[[I]{.mark} would like to [see]{.mark} whether and [under what
conditions we could re-engineer the utopia of a borderless
world]{.mark}]{.underline}, and by extension, a borderless Africa,
since, as far as I know, Africa is part of the world. And the world is
part +of Africa.

It is important to attend once again to what is obviously a utopian
intent, the question of a borderless world. [From its inception
"movement" or more precisely "[borderlessness" has been central to
various utopian traditions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} very
[concept of utopia]{.mark}, [refers to]{.mark} that which has no
borders, [beginning with the imagination itself]{.mark}. **[The power of
utopianism]{.mark}** lies in its ability to instantiate the tension
between borderlessness, movement and place, a tension]{.underline}---if
we look carefully---**[that [has marked social transformations in the
modern era]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This tension continues in
contemporary discussions of movement-based social processes,
particularly international migration, open borders, transnationalism and
even cosmopolitanism]{.underline}. [In this context, **[the idea of a
borderless world can be a powerful]{.mark}** albeit problematic
**[resource for social]{.mark}, political and even aesthetic
[imagination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Because of [the current atrophy of
an utopian imagination, apocalyptic imaginaries and [narratives of
cataclysmic disasters]{.mark} and unknown futures [have colonised the
spirit of our time]{.mark}]{.underline}. [But what politics do visions
of apocalypse and catastrophe engender, if not a politics of separation,
rather than a politics of the humanity, as species coming into
being]{.underline}? [Because we inherit a history in which the
consistent sacrifice of some lives for the betterment of others is the
norm]{.underline}, [and [because these are times of deep- seated
anxieties]{.mark}, including anxieties [of racialised others taking over
the planet]{.mark}]{.underline}; [because of all of that**, [racial
violence is increasingly encoded in the language of the]{.mark}**
[**border and** **of** **security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result,
[[contemporary borders are in danger of becoming sites of
reinforcement]{.underline}]{.mark}, reproduction and intensification
[[of]{.mark} [vulnerability for stigmatised]{.mark}]{.underline} and
dishonoured [[groups]{.underline}]{.mark}, for the most racially marked,
the ever more disposable, those that in the era of neoliberal
abandonment have been paying the heaviest price for the most expansive
period of prison construction in human history. I refer to the prison
here, the carceral landscapes of our world, precisely as the antithesis
of movement, of freedom of movement. There is not a more dramatic
opposition to the idea of movement than the prison. And the prison is a
key feature of the landscape of our times.

In proposing to re-examine the question of a borderless Africa and a
borderless world, [I would like to stay away from]{.underline} dominant
ways with which this issue has been dealt. That is under [the sign of
Kant and his promise of unbounded cosmopolitanism]{.underline}, [and
under the sign of liberal individualism understood as an antidote or to
the deeply ingrained fascist impulses of European governance and
bureaucracies]{.underline}. Although they seem to be worlds apart, both
of these approaches are articulated around the concept of the fourth
freedom.

In classical liberal thought there are three core freedoms: First of
all, freedom of movement. Within freedom of movement, there is freedom
of movement of capital, priority number one. But, since there is no
capital without goods, there is freedom of movement of goods. Number
three is services, and especially in these times of ours, the freedom of
movement of those who can provide services. Those are the three core
freedoms. So the concept of the fourth freedom has to do with freedom of
movement of persons. Traditional engagements with the idea of a
borderless world aimed at precipitating the advent of that fourth
freedom. Within that configuration a borderless world would be a world
of free movement of: capital, goods, services and persons. Such
movement, such freedom of movement would not be restricted to the core
economically rich countries or states, which is the case as we speak.
The Schengen system, for instance, is limited to the core European
countries. In fact, **[[if you have an American passport you can
basically go wherever you want]{.underline}. [The world belongs to
you]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But this is not the case for every
inhabitant of our planet. S[o in the configuration I have just referred
to, the fourth freedom, [the ability to move around the planet]{.mark}
would no longer be limited to Europeans and Americans]{.underline}. [It
[would be a radical right that would belong to everybody]{.mark} by
virtue of each and every individual being a human being]{.underline}.
[It is a right that would be extended to poor members of the earth. So
we keep going back to the question of the earth]{.underline}. There
would be no visas, in some instantiations of the fourth freedom of
movement there would be no quotas, and no bizarre category to fill in,
because you would not even have to apply for a visa. One could just get
on a plane, a train, a boat, on the road, or on a bike. Rights of
non-discrimination would be extended to all. I will give you one little
example. In Cameroon, until the beginning of the 1980s, it was possible
to travel to France with one's national identity card. Most people went
to France and came back. They did not go because they wanted to settle
there. Most people want to live where they "belong". But they want to be
able to come and go. And they are more likely to come and go when the
borders are not hermetically closed. So,  a borderless world imagined by
the fourth freedom of movement is premised, therefore on this right of
non-discrimination and on this circulatory and pendular set of
migrations.

To elucidate or pose differently the question of a borderless world, is
to contrast two paradigms. On the one hand, examine the liberal idea of
a borderless world through the free movement concept and contrast it
with African precolonial understandings of movement in space.
Contrasting these two paradigms will hopefully give us conceptual
resources to expand on this utopian project of a borderless world.

When I say liberal classical thought, of course it is extremely
complicated, we understand that. I am giving you an archetype, which
itself needs to be properly deconstructed. And here I will rely in
particular on a recently published work called Movement and the Ordering
of Freedom published by Hagar Kotef, an Israeli scholar who teaches at
School of Oriental and African Studies  in London. You might let your
imagination work and understand why it is an Israeli who is interested
in this. What Kotef shows in that work is the extent to which liberal
political thought has in fact always been saddled with a contradiction
when it comes to imagining the possibility of a borderless world. Her
argument is that this contradiction stems from its conception of
movement. She shows that, in fact, two dominant configurations of
movement constantly come into conflict with one another, cancelling each
other at times within classical liberal thought. [[**Movement**]{.mark}
here **[is seen]{.mark}** both as a manifestation of freedom and as an
interruption, **[as a threat to order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[One of
the functions of the state is, therefore, to craft a concept of order,
stability and security]{.mark}** that is reconcilable with its concept
of freedom and its concept of movement. **That is the
contradiction**]{.underline}. [Kotef argues, **[the liberal classical
state is the enemy of people who restlessly move
around]{.mark}**]{.underline}.  **[[Such people are configured as an
unassimilable other]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [You cannot assimilate them.
**[They are constantly on the move]{.mark}**. There are colonial
repercussions to all of this]{.underline}. The biggest problem of [**the
colonial state in** the continent of **Africa**]{.underline} from the
19th century onwards [was to make sure people stayed in the same place.
It **had a hard time achieving this**. They were constantly on the move.
**They were "uncaptured**]{.underline}".

[So, the business of the state is how to capture them. Without capturing
them, sovereignty does not mean anything]{.underline}. **[[Sovereignty
means you capture a people, you capture a
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}**, you delimit borders [and this allows
you, in turn, to exercise the monopoly of territory, of course, monopoly
over the people and in terms of the use of legitimate force and, very
importantly---because everything else depends on that---monopoly over
taxation]{.underline}. **[Y[ou cannot tax people who have no
address]{.underline}]{.mark}**[. [The state sees such people as
enemies]{.mark}]{.underline}, [both of freedom, because they do not
exercise it with restraint, and [of security and
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [You cannot build an order on the basis
of that which is unstable]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The same state is a friend of self-regulated movement. Why? Because
freedom here is understood as being about moderation, about
self-regulation. It's not about excess---excessive movement immediately
conjures problems of security. [So, as Kotef argues, movement not only
has to be restrained via an array of disciplinary mechanisms, it has to
be reconciled with freedom and to some extent
self-restraint]{.underline}, [but the ability to restrain or regulate
oneself is not assumed to be the share of all subjects]{.underline}. Not
everybody is able to restrain ~~him- or herself~~ themself. [**[Some
movements were therefore configured as freedom, and others
were]{.mark}** deemed improper and were **[conceived as a
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That is the bifurcation we have in
classical liberal thought**. [It is the spectre that haunts classical
liberal states]{.mark}**, from those years up to now. We have not gotten
rid of that spectre]{.underline}.

The way in which classical liberal states have tried to resolve this
contradiction has been by managed mobility, which is back on the agenda
right now as I speak, in Europe and even in South Africa where I have
been doing some work with the Department of Home Affairs on
recalibrating inter-African migrations. The key concept is "managed
mobility". So, within the framework of managed mobility, certain
categories of the population are constantly seen as posing a threat, not
only to themselves and to their own security, but also to others'
security. Such a threat, it is thought, can be diminished if their
movements are confined and if they are domesticated and subject to some
type of reform.

[In the classical liberal model security and freedom came to be defined
as a right of exclusion]{.underline}. [Order within that model is about
securing the unequal ordering of property relations]{.underline}.
[Asserting the boundaries of the nation goes hand in hand in that model
with the assertion of the boundaries of race]{.underline}. [Now,
defining the boundaries of race within that model requires a proper
definition of the boundaries of the body; the centrality of the body in
the calculus of both freedom and security]{.underline}.

First of all, let me say that **[[pre-colonial
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}** might not have been a borderless world, at
least in the sense in which we **[[have]{.underline}]{.mark}** been
defining borders, but where the existing
**[[borders]{.underline}]{.mark}** were **[[always porous and
permeable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [**[business of a border
is,]{.mark} in fact[, to be crossed]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} That is what
borders are for]{.underline}. [There is no conceivable border outside of
that principle, the law of permeability]{.underline}. As evidenced by
traditions of long-distance trade, circulation was fundamental. It was
fundamental in the production of cultural forms, of political forms, of
economic and social and religious forms. [[The most important vehicle
for transformation and change was mobility]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It
was not class struggles in the sense that we understand
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. Mobility was the motor of any kind of social or
economic or political transformation. In fact, it was the driving
principle behind the delimitation and organisation of space and
territories. So the primordial principle of spatial organisation was
continuous movement. And this is also still part of present day culture.
**[[To stop is to run risks. You have to be on the move
constantly]{.mark}. More and more, especially in conditions of crisis,
being on the move is the very condition of your survival[. If you are
not on the move, the chances of survival are
diminished]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [So **[dominance over sovereignty was
not exclusively expressed through the control of a territory,]{.mark}
physically marked with borders**]{.underline}. [It was not.  How was it
then? [**If** **you do not control a territory, how** **can you exercise
sovereignty**]{.mark}]{.underline}? [How can you extract anything, since
as far as we know, power expresses itself also, if not primarily,
through one or the other form of extraction]{.underline}.

[[All]{.mark} of that [was expressed through
networks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Networks and crossroads. The importance
of roads and crossroads in African literature is astounding. Read
Soyinka, read Achebe, read Tutuola. Roads and crossroads are everywhere
in their literature. [So crossroads, flows of people and flows of
nature, both in dialectical relationships because in those cosmogonies
people are unthinkable without what we call nature]{.underline}. So
while the Anthropocene's turn seems to be a novelty in parts of our
world today, we have always lived in that. It is not new. Because you
cannot think of people, without thinking of nonhumans. Read Tutuola, it
is a world of humans and non-humans, interacting, acting with others. I
do not want to exaggerate this. [Fixed geographical spaces, such as
towns and villages did exist. People and things could be concentrated in
a particular location. Such places could even become the origin of
movement and there were links between places, such as roads and flight
paths, but places were not described by points or lines]{.underline}.
What mattered the most was the distribution of movement between places.
[[Movement was the driving force]{.mark} of the production of space and
movement itself, if we are to belief some [of those
cosmogonies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here I have in mind the Dogon
cosmogonies that were particularly studied by Marcel Griaule, or other
cosmogonies in Equatorial Africa dealt with by anthropologists and
historians like Jan Vansina, John M. Janzen and others. [Movement itself
was not necessarily akin to displacement. What mattered the most was
**[the extent to which flows and their intensities intersected]{.mark}**
and interacted **[with other flows]{.mark}**, the new forms they could
take when they intensified]{.underline}. [Movement]{.underline},
especially among the Dogon, [could lead to diversions, conversions and
intersections]{.underline}. [[These were more important than points,
lines and surfaces, which are, as we know cardinal references in western
geometrics]{.underline}]{.mark}. So, [what we have [here is a different
kind of geometry out of which concepts of]{.mark} borders,
[power,]{.mark} relations and [separation derive]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[If we want to harness alternative resources, the conceptual vocabulary
type, [**to imagine a borderless world**, **here is an
archive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is not the only one]{.underline}.
**[But [what we harness are the archives of the world at
large]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and not only the western
archive]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [In fact, the western archive does not
help us to develop an idea of borderlessness**. [The western archive is
premised on the crystallisation of the idea of a
border]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

## Framework

### Notes

This strategy against framework is centered around reasonability. This
might seem odd with a K aff---most people don't read K affs to be
topical in the first place, so reasonability doesn't come up nearly as
much. However, I think it's a pretty underutilized strategy that, with a
lot of practice and explicit judge instruction, can appeal to a lot of
more policy-leaning judges, because it lets you translate it into terms
that make sense to them.

The most important thing to make clear is that this isn't the same
reasonability argument that you'd make with a policy aff against a T
argument, because you can't really pass off your interpretation as
"reasonable"---at least, not in the same sense as a policy
interpretation. Instead, you should **explicitly instruct** the judge to
**choose** to decide that your interpretations are reasonable readings
of the resolution, **even if they don't think that our interpretations
are the "true" definition of the word at hand**. Your offensive argument
for why this is a good way for the judge to evaluate T debates (or, at
least, the T debate that you are having) is that choosing to race to the
"truest" interpretation enables the operations of cyberwar even if
individual debates seem like they might be able to resist those
operations, because the essence of cyberwar is redefining truth itself
(editing the value of bits of information in computers to send false or
faulty messages). Every attempt to establish a particular definition as
"true" over the course of time has some militarized dimension; it's just
a question of how much. Thus, choosing to read seemingly unreasonable
interpretations of the resolution as "reasonable" feeds faulty data into
the algorithm and interrupts this process, if only a little bit.

You should only read the counter-interpretations that make sense based
on the 1NC! Obviously these cards are pretty long! If you only had time
to read one card (besides Joque, the reasonability card), I would read
Collier, because it also references the US and NATO and says
"cooperate." **Don't prioritize reading cards** (that's why there aren't
many)---the 1AC has a lot of framework tricks and arguments built in.
Use those!

### C/I---Cybersecurity---2AC

#### Cybersecurity is "the security of the environment formed by physical and non-physical components and characterised by the use of computers and other networked devices." Debates about US-NATO security cooperation are [more accurate]{.underline} when they theorize states as [assemblages]{.underline} rather than [unitary actors]{.underline}.

**Collier, 18**---Cyber Security DPhil Candidate based at the Department
of Politics and International Relations, and the Centre for Doctoral
Training in Cyber Security, University of Oxford, formerly worked at the
NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Jamie, "Cyber
Security Assemblages: A Framework for Understanding the Dynamic and
Contested Nature of Security Provision," Politics and Governance, Volume
6, Issue 2, July 2018, dml)

Refreshed thinking is required to better understand the provision of
cyber security and the configuration of cyber security actors. Here,
[the **term cyber security** is **defined** as the security of the
environment formed by **physical** and **non-physical components** and
characterised by the use of **computers** and other **networked
devices**]{.underline}. Cyber security actors, by definition, provide
security in some capacity. Yet this does not mean that all actors strive
to achieve a single, unitary concept of security. [The prevalence of
private actors]{.underline} means that cyber security is often provided
by actors who prioritise other commercial objectives over security.
Encryption disputes between the US government and technology firms show
that different actors have altogether different motivations.

This [makes the study of the **different cyber security
providers**]{.underline}, [and how they **interact** with one another
**essential**]{.underline}. [The concept of **global cyber security
assemblages** provides a **conceptual anchor** that provides a means for
**further understanding** these issues]{.underline}. [The term provides
a **more appropriate concept for understanding contemporary cyber
security contexts** when compared to **more traditional
frameworks**]{.underline}. [The security assemblage term]{.underline}
refers to new hybrid structures that are often simultaneously public and
private, global and local. The use of the term is part of an emerging
body of scholarship within IR literature that [seeks to **empirically
assess** complex structures where a **range** of different global and
local]{.underline}, [public and private security agents]{.underline},
interact, **[cooperate]{.underline}** and compete [to produce
new]{.underline} institutions, practices and [forms of **security
governance** that **cannot be captured neatly though the boundaries of
nation states**]{.underline} (Abrahamsen & Williams, 2011; Williams,
2016).

[The assemblage concept]{.underline} therefore [moves **away** from
the]{.underline} traditional centre of the [nation-state to
**multi-layered**]{.underline}, networked [**configurations**
that]{.underline} are able to [accommodate a **range of entities**
including (inter)governmental]{.underline},
[para-governmental]{.underline}, [nongovernmental]{.underline}, [and
private organisations]{.underline} (Voelkner, 2013). [The boundaries of
an assemblage can be drawn in **alternative ways** to the traditional
contours of national borders]{.underline}. They can be drawn to examine
the provision of security within a territory but can also be used [to
examine security or governance contexts that are **inherently
international**]{.underline}. The issue of **[internet
governance]{.underline}**, for example, [comprises a **global
assemblage** of actors]{.underline}, [albeit one **dominated by US
actors**]{.underline} (Carr, 2014). Perhaps the most defining
characteristic of the assemblage concept is therefore an accommodation
of the forces of globalisation and a scepticism of rigid borders and
distinctions. Of course, much of the above relates closely to other
terms including actor network theory; indeed, the difference between the
terms is one of emphasis, rather than kind (Acuto & Curtis, 2014) with
the similarities and differences between the two concepts discussed in
greater detail elsewhere (Acuto & Curtis, 2014; Müller & Schurr, 2016).

[For]{.underline} the purposes of **[understanding cyber security
provision]{.underline}**, it is [the notion of **assembly** and
**disassembly**]{.underline}--- [where actors relinquish]{.underline},
[transfer and develop capacities and functions]{.underline}---that [is
**central**]{.underline} to the added value of the assemblage concept.
As security functions emerge and are captured by either public or
private actors, actors assemble greater capabilities and
responsibilities. [As private actors increasingly take on
strategic]{.underline}, [ethical]{.underline}, [and foreign-policy
alignment issues that were previously outside their
purview]{.underline}, [they are **assembling** into more political
actors]{.underline}. Conversely, as aspects of cyber security are
increasingly regulated and managed by states, other aspects of private
actors' capabilities and responsibilities are disassembling.
Contemporary cyber security practices are replete with these instances
of assembly and disassembly. Assemblage thinking therefore pays
attention to the instability of security networks. While cyber security
is provided by a vast array of actors, assemblage thinking also
highlights the contestation related to the roles and responsibilities of
security actors. In light of emerging and shifting actors, [the point is
**not** to demonstrate that states are **stronger** or
**weaker**]{.underline}. Rather, [the intention is to examine the
**complex configuration** of actors that maintain contingent and
multifaceted relationships with each other]{.underline} (relationships
[that **cannot be captured by static** and]{.underline} often
**[state-centric theories]{.underline}**). [Cyber security is
**replete** with global and local]{.underline}, [public and private
agents whose relationships are **deeply competitive** as well
as]{.underline} **[cooperative]{.underline}**, conflictual, and at times
coordinated. While the concept of a security assemblage has been applied
to cyber security in previous literature (Stevens, 2012, 2016, pp.
181--186), the argument for why and how the concept should be used and
applied to cyber security remains underdeveloped---an imbalance this
article hopes to correct.

These hybrid structures are clearly observed through contemporary
examples with the cyber security of critical national infrastructure
(CNI) in the UK a case in point. The vast majority of CNI is owned and
managed by corporations---itself a broad church that includes a variety
of actor types including not-for-profit community owned private limited
firms, regional and UK-based firms, multinational firms (National Grid
operates in both the US and UK for example, probing traditional
global-local distinctions) and state-owned or quasi-state owned firms
(the now approved Hinkley Point nuclear plant will be owned and managed
by a combination of French-state majority owned EDF energy and Chinese
state-owned China General Nuclear Power Corporation) (Ward, Pickard, &
Stothard, 2016). As a collective, these corporations cannot neatly be
categorised as 'private' given the variety of entities including the
presence of both partially and fully state-owned entities. [Corporations
provide cyber security alongside a **range of government
departments**]{.underline}, including GCHQ and its subsidiary, the
National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC); the Cabinet Office, the various
government departments that are largely responsible for infrastructure
related to their department and related institutions such as the Centre
for the Protection of National Infrastructure (Collier, 2016). All of
[these government entities have their **own identities**]{.underline},
[**agendas** and **motivations**]{.underline}---[a **reality** that
means that]{.underline} '**[the government]{.underline}**' [is **not
necessarily a coherent entity at all**]{.underline}. [Adding to the
plethora of actors are various **international organisations** and
**multilateral bodies**]{.underline}. [Various actors **work together**
within this cyber security assemblage]{.underline}, often in unusual
ways. With Chinese-based firm Huawei providing communication equipment
for CNI organisations, GCHQ employees will routinely monitor, take apart
and inspect the equipment supplied (due to security concerns) at a
centre that is itself funded by Huawei (Rifkind, 2013; Rosenzweig,
2013).

[An assemblage approach also considers the **normative agendas** behind
the traditional categories and distinctions used in IR
literature]{.underline}. [Pursuing assemblage thinking means paying
attention to the **relationships** between a variety of actors and the
**forces** that impel them to act in the way they do]{.underline}
(Lisle, 2013). [The process of assemblage formation is **not neutral**
but **deeply political**]{.underline}. [Different actors have **clashing
views** on]{.underline} what [aspects of cyber security]{.underline}
should be 'public' or 'private' [as well as where the boundaries of
these distinctions lie]{.underline}. Returning to the UK example, the UK
2016 Cyber Security Strategy declared that market based solutions to
cyber security have 'not produced the required pace and scale of
change', meaning that 'Government has to lead the way and intervene more
directly by bringing its influence and resources to bear' in a move that
overtly seeks to increase the government's cyber security purview (HM
Government, 2016). On the other hand, governments have also sought to
relinquish both their authority and responsibility of cyber security
issues within other contexts in order to avoid the backlash of security
failings (Carr, 2016). This is also observed in recent US encryption
disputes that reflect broader political disagreements about the agency
afforded to different actors. Law enforcement organisations' interests
in accessing intelligence on devices clash with technology firms who
instead seek to protect their customers' data from government access,
(albeit while simultaneously selling user data to other businesses and
using it themselves for the purposes of targeted advertisements).
Various government entities compete with each other for ownership of
cyber security and the tax revenue that accompanies the issue.
Alternative visions of cyber security are proposed within such
intra-governmental competition---the issue may be framed through a
military, business or criminal prism depending on the government entity
that seeks to capture the issue. [These tensions are **mirrored** at the
international level where]{.underline} various [multilateral
organisations **compete for relevance** on the issue
including]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.underline}**); the United Nations (UN) through the Group of
Governmental Experts on Information Security; The European Union Agency
for Network and Information Security (ENISA); the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU); etc. It is [this]{.underline} notion of
contestation that [further **distinguishes** an assemblage approach from
other theoretical lenses that **merely acknowledge** the importance of
units other than states or the increasingly blurry lines that exist
between different types of actors]{.underline}.

### C/I---NATO---2AC

#### NATO is an assemblage, "a number of disparate and heterogeneous elements convoked together into a single discernible formation." That's [limited]{.underline} and [predictable]{.underline}.

**Handeland, 19**---Master of Science candidate in International
Relations, Department of International Environment and Development
Studies, Norwegian University of Life Sciences (Lars, "Exploring the
knowledge-politics nexus in global governance: A case study of the
anti-chemical weapons assemblage in Syria (2013-2017),"
<https://nmbu.brage.unit.no/nmbu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2642646/Handeland2019.pdf>,
dml)

Originally developed as a concept by the philosopher Gilles [**Deleuze**
and]{.underline} his writing partner, the psychoanalyst Felix
**[Guattari]{.underline}**, **[defined assemblage]{.underline}** in the
following way: "[An assemblage is a **number of disparate** and
**heterogeneous elements** convoked together into a **single discernible
formation**]{.underline}" (Deleuze & Guattari as cited Bueger, 2014c, p.
60). Importantly, the French word they use is agencement. Derived from
the verb agencer, the noun agencement can roughly be translated into the
'act of assembling', and highlights the ongoing and neverending
processes of shifts and transformations (Phillips, 2006). 8

The term '**[convoked]{.underline}**' [implies that they are brought
together towards a **function** or **purpose**]{.underline}. Indeed,
"[every assemblage is characterized by the process of constituting
a]{.underline} \"**[territory]{.underline}**\" [that holds together
distinct]{.underline} or heterogenous [elements]{.underline}..."(Hayden,
1998, p. 96). [The territory]{.underline}, then, [comes to signify the
**identity** of a given assemblage]{.underline}, [which is derived from
its **purpose** or **function**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the assemblage is
**not**]{.underline} "[a **random collection of things**]{.underline},
since there is a sense that [an assemblage is a **whole** of some sort
that expresses some **identity** and claims a
**territory**]{.underline}" (Wise, 2005, p. 77).

Next, understanding how assemblages 'claims a territory' requires a look
at some of the associated ideas found in the work of Deleuze and
Guattari. As such, the terms territorialization-deterritorialization,
the material-expressive axis, and practices of assembling must be
outlined first.

To start with, I think it is worth quoting Deleuze and Guattari at
length here, giving their original formulation of an assemblage's
features:

On a first, horizontal axis, an assemblage comprises two segments, on of
content, the other of expression. On the one hand it is a machinic
assemblage of bodies, of actions and passions, an intermingling of
bodies reacting to one another; on the other hand it is a collective
assemblage of enunciation, of acts and statements, of incorporeal
transformations attributed to bodies. Then on a vertical axis, the
assemblage has both territorial sides, or reterritorialized sides, which
stabilize it, and cutting edges of deterritorialization, which carry it
away. (Deleuze & Guattari, 2013, pp. 102--103)

In other words, there are two axes in in the assemblage; a vertical axis
of territorialization and deterritorialization, and a horizontal axis of
components (DeLanda, 2006, p. 12). The vertical axis captures the
stability of the assemblage, i.e. whether its internal stability
increases or decreases , whereas the horizontal consists of elements
ranging from the purely material to the purely expressive (Patton, 2006,
p. 27). These four features gives the assemblage a tetravalent
systematization, which signifies the means of combination (Dewsbury,
2011). Next, I unpack these two axes to discuss and assess their
applicability as thinking tools for studies of international relations.

On the vertical material-expressive axis, there is the material or
machinic end, which consist of matter and bodies (Patton, 2006, p. 27).
On the other end there is what Deleuze and Guattari calls the collective
assemblage of enunciation, a rather broad category of different
expressive elements including discourses, knowledges, semiotics and
gestures. Taken together, the heterogeneous elements in an assemblage
include socially situated subjects, materials, objectives and different
"knowledges, discourses, institutions, laws and regulatory regimes"
(Murray Li, 2007, p. 266).

At the same time, [assemblage thinking accentuates **becoming** and
**emergence**]{.underline}, meaning that [its]{.underline}
'[territory]{.underline}' [is **never fully stabilized**]{.underline}.
In fact, [a **core perspective**]{.underline} in assemblage thinking [is
that]{.underline} "[structural stability is seen as **exception** rather
than the **norm**]{.underline}" (Bueger, 2018, p. 619). As such, the
territory claimed by the assemblage constantly undergoes processes that
stabilize, weakens and reshapes it. In assemblage thinking these are
termed: territorialization, deterritorialization and
reterritorialization, respectively. This leads us to the second and
processual horizontal axis of the assemblage.

As for processes that increase hegemony among the content or elements of
the assemblage, called territoritalization, this is "first to be
understood as a process that defines or sharpens the spatial boundaries
of actual territory" (Bueger, 2018, p. 620). For the study of global
governance, territorialization refers to the process of carving out a
territory of political space that can be governed. The physical
boundaries of such a space can be rather fluid, spread across great
distances and be located at many sites. For instance, in Bueger's (2018)
study of the counter-piracy assemblage, territorialization referred not
only to the creation of a special zone in the Indian Ocean, but also to
the various sites and fora all over the world where stakeholders met and
developed plans for action.

Importantly, "territorialization also refers to non-spatial processes.
Practices such as classifying or sorting in and out, defining which
actors, objects and practices belong to the territory, and what
particular role they have are also processes of creating homogeneity"
(Bueger, 2018, p. 620). Indeed, in Bueger's paradigmatic case study,
territorialization also included creating consensus on which practices
of governance were to be considered legitimate regarding counter-piracy
efforts, which ended up being inscribed in document called Best
Practices Management. Hence, the making of consensual knowledge was a
crucial aspect in the process of territorialization by creating
homogeneity among the vast array of relevant stakeholders.

As a result, [processes of territorialization in global governance
settings are **infused with power** when]{.underline}, for instance,
[boundaries are drawn up to **delineate specific knowledges as
authoritative** at the expense of other ways of knowing]{.underline}.
This is why [the act of **sorting out what belongs** and **does not
belong** in the assemblage directs attention to the **power dynamics**
at play in the assemblage]{.underline} as territorialization can work
"through shutting out contingency and entrenching one particular
assemblage...over others" (Müller, 2015, p. 36). Consequently,
[territorialization is a **crucial dimension for analysis** as it
highlights]{.underline} what might be termed [the practice of inclusion
and exclusion]{.underline}, [which **defines what belongs** and **what
does not**]{.underline}.

However, even though an assemblage could be deeply entrenched, it is
never final and always vulnerable to processes of deterritorialization,
which destabilize the it (DeLanda, 2006, p. 12). More concretely, the
idea of deterritorialization as a process that can undo the stability of
an assemblage allows this mode of inquiry to capture transformations and
changes on the 'territory'. Thus, the erosion of boundaries understood
in a broad sense, such as undermining identities, are processes of
deterritorialization (Alvesson & Sköldberg, 2017, p. 58).

The important point here is that for studies of expertise, [the concept
provides the means to **account** for how]{.underline}, for instance,
[knowledge claims put forwards by experts can be **contested**,
**challenged** and **critiqued**]{.underline}. [This can result in a
**destabilization** of the assemblage and make it **shift** and
**transform**]{.underline}. As such, by opening up for new relations to
be established means that [relations of authority can
**shift**]{.underline}, thus [creating]{.underline} '**[windows of
opportunity]{.underline}**' [where **new connections** can be
made]{.underline}. Therefore, "in the process of assembling one always
sees a territorialising force and a deterritorialising potential: here
is where power comes to play (Lancione, 2013, p. 359).

The territory, then, can be unmade by the forces of deterritorialization
and finally there is a potential for reterritorialization of the
relations between components in the assemblage (Hayden, 1998, p. 96). As
far as this author is aware, the notion of re-territorialization has not
been widely used in the literature on assemblages in IR. The idea here
is that [while assemblages are inherently unstable]{.underline}, [they
also tend to **reestablish themselves** because they express a
**purpose** or **function**]{.underline}. [The **longevity** of certain
institutions could be taken as an example of this]{.underline}. For
instance, one could say that [**NATO** expressed a **purpose** or
**function** so that while the **end of the Cold War** initiated a
deterritorialization of the **NATO-assemblage**]{.underline}, [it
**nonetheless reterritorialized**]{.underline}, albeit in a different
form. Importantly, the idea of reterritorialization is not a synthesis
of a territorialization thesis and a deterritorialization antithesis
(Legg, 2011, p. 129), but aims to capture yet another transformation
that the territory might undergo.

Taken together, these processes are then "the qualitative
transformations of complex assemblages on the basis of proliferating
relations between heterogeneous terms (Hayden, 1998, pp. 95--96).
Because this is an ongoing and constant process, [the assemblage is
**always becoming**]{.underline} or emergent [rather than a **static**
or **stable being**]{.underline} (Wise, 2005, pp. 78--79). Hence, [an
analysis centered on assemblage thinking should look for the **changes**
and **transformations** on a given]{.underline}
'[territory]{.underline}', [and **question** how the assemblage
**articulates relations** between its constituting
elements]{.underline}, for instance, the relationship between knowledge
and politics.

### C/I---USFG---2AC

#### The USFG is an assemblage. Did you not see Hamilton?

**Aroney, 2**---Professor of Constitutional Law at The University of
Queensland (Nicholas, "Imagining a Federal Commonwealth: Australian
Conceptions of Federalism, 1890-1901," Federal Law Review, 30(2), 265,
dml)

Putting these points together, Just apparently sought to show that it
was necessary to have [a **strong federal government**]{.underline} in
which the will of the majority prevailed, but that such a government
[must **first** be formed with the consent of]{.underline} each of the
several colonies as **[independent bodies politic]{.underline}**. As the
Herald had maintained, [a federation comes into being by **unanimous
agreement** of the constituent bodies politic]{.underline}, and [they
agree to confer **limited functions** on a central government that makes
its decisions by majority rule]{.underline}, [but the **remainder** of
their constituent and governmental powers are **retained**]{.underline}.

Just also felt it important to draw the attention of his Australian
readers to Hamilton\'s famous discussion of Montesquieu\'s classic
definition of the \'Confederate Republic\'. As reproduced by Just,
Montesquieu had said:

It is very probable that mankind would have been obliged, at length, to
live constantly under the Government of a single person, had they not
contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of
a Republican, together with the external force of a Monarchical,
Government---I mean a Confederate Republic.

[This form of **Government**]{.underline} is a convention by which
several smaller States agree to become members of a larger one, which
they intend to form. It [is a kind of **assemblage** of
societies]{.underline}, [that constitutes a **new one**]{.underline},
[capable of **increasing** by means of new associations till they arrive
at such a degree of power]{.underline} as to be able [to
provide]{.underline} for the **[security]{.underline}** of the united
body. \... As this Government is composed of small Republics, it enjoys
the internal happiness of each, and with respect to its external
situation, it is possessed, by means of the association, of all the
advantages of large Monarchies.

A Republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may
support itself without any internal corruption. \... As this Government
is composed of small Republics, it enjoys the internal happiness of
each, and with respect to its external situation, it is possessed, by
means of the association, of all the advantages of large
Monarchies.\[47\]

In Montesquieu\'s day, political reflection suggested that large,
territorial monarchies had the advantage of external security, but they
also suffered the internal disadvantage of a tendency to despotism,
whereas the small republic had the advantage of a virtuous citizenry
actively participating in the government, but suffered the external
disadvantage of susceptibility to assimilation by larger powers.
Montesquieu suggested that the advantages of each might be secured in
what he called the confederate republic.

Hamilton commented on this idea in Federalist No 9. As reproduced by
Just, [**Hamilton** proposed that the]{.underline}
\'**[definition]{.underline}**\' [of a]{.underline} \'Confederate
Republic\' or \'**[Federal Government]{.underline}**\' [was]{.underline}
\'**[an assemblage of societies]{.underline}**\' or \'an association of
two or more States into one State\'. So long, Hamilton maintained, that
the \'separate organisation of the members be not abolished\', but
rather exists \'by a constitutional necessity for local purposes\', then
[despite their]{.underline} \'**[subordination]{.underline}**\' [to an
additional]{.underline} \'[general authority]{.underline}\' or national
government created for specific purposes, [the scheme
remains]{.underline} \'[an **Association**]{.underline} of States or a
Confederacy\'. Indeed, Hamilton pointed out, the proposed United States
Constitution treated the states as \'constituent parts\' of the Union,
allowing them \'direct representation in the Senate\' and leaving them
with \'certain exclusive and very important portions of the sovereign
power\'.\[48\]

or]{.underline}, at the very least, [the **veracity of**]{.underline}
her **[information]{.underline}**. Any political efficacy from leaking
information and destroying institutional secrecy requires the production
of truth or some sort of truth-effect in the network that would engender
a political response. Given the risks that false information could be
leaked for the purposes of deception, or produced for other ends, as we
saw in the case of Sabu, [it becomes **difficult to determine the
veracity** of any individual bit of information]{.underline}. More
fundamentally, [cyberwar in its **very functioning** is an **attack on
truth** and its **material** and **epistemic
underpinnings**]{.underline}. [Under the threat of
cyberwar]{.underline}, [and the possibility that any information may
have already been compromised]{.underline}, [epistemology and truth
become not only **philosophical concerns** but **military-strategic
problems** as well]{.underline}.

In this light, [it becomes **difficult to separate any truth** from its
**political** and **military investment**]{.underline}. Derrida in
"Plato's Pharmacy" suggests that "the opposition between the true and
the untrue is entirely comprehended, inscribed, within this structure or
this generalized writing. The true and the untrue are both species of
repetition. And there is no repetition possible without the graphics of
supplementarity."18 Here, for Derrida, the true does not transcend the
structure of writing in general. There is no unity but only a relation
among units of inscription. [The true and the untrue are movements of
**repetition** within and between systems]{.underline}, [a movement
defined by text and network]{.underline}. [Truth and its opposite become
**emergent effects** of networks and texts rather than
**transcendental** or **global attributes**]{.underline} of systems.
[Like certificate authorities for verifying identity on open
networks]{.underline}, [the guarantee of any information is merely
**deferred** to a different level]{.underline}. [Truth emerges as a
result of the **structure** and **folds** of a given
system]{.underline}.

[This is **not** to suggest that truth is **relative**]{.underline}; [it
is **intimately tied** to the **real** and **material movement** of
texts]{.underline}, programs, bits, capital, and so on, through the
various global networks and systems at stake.19 [Still]{.underline},
[what makes information true is precisely its **inscription** within a
given network and its **repetition throughout** rather than through some
**preexisting global phenomenon**]{.underline}. Lacan's insights in this
regard are especially helpful. He suggests that [truth is a function of
**language**]{.underline}.20 [Truth is produced by the **entire
network** of signifiers and subjects and always points to the truth of
the **structure** rather than the veracity of an **individual
statement**]{.underline}.21 Thus [truth]{.underline} for Lacan [is
always a question of the **symbolic** and is **never synonymous** with
the real]{.underline}. The real can never be falsified, for it is always
exactly where it is; it is "always in its place."22 [A bit is **never**
on its own **true** or **false**]{.underline}; the signifier in the real
is, as Kittler suggests, merely a voltage difference.23 [It is **only
through**]{.underline} language, **[interpretation]{.underline}**, and
software [that the bit comes to produce an **effect**]{.underline};
[through the networks of signification]{.underline}, the networks of
voltage difference become capable of producing a truth-effect. [It is on
these grounds that cyberwar becomes **so insidious**]{.underline}, by
threatening to flip bits at the level of the real; [underneath
language]{.underline}, [it demonstrates both the **symbolic threat**
possessed by this real and the **inability** for the symbolic ever to
achieve]{.underline} a full unity or [mastery]{.underline}.

[Truth becomes an effect of its movements through space and the programs
that operate upon it]{.underline}. [Any politics that commits itself to
**truth alone** as the grounds for a politics risks merely partaking of
the **autoimmune violence of undecidability**]{.underline}. [The end of
secrecy **cannot in itself** be a panacea for political
injustice]{.underline}. In August 2010, Reporters without Borders sent
an open letter to Assange suggesting precisely that his politics
(insomuch as they were [a politics of truth]{.underline} rather than of
mere destruction) were shortsighted and paid little attention to the
chain of effects that followed the dissemination of the "Afghanistan War
Logs":

You have unintentionally provided supposedly democratic governments with
good grounds for putting the Internet under closer surveillance. . .
.Indiscriminately publishing 92,000 classified reports reflects a real
problem of methodology and, therefore, of credibility. Journalistic work
involves the selection of information.

Reporters without Borders insists that journalistic work
[is]{.underline} not simply about providing information but rather
[about **filtering**]{.underline}, **[selecting]{.underline}**, [and
**assessing** information]{.underline}, in short, about [the **program**
that is brought to bear upon information]{.underline}. Even though they
may take issue with Assange's choices of selecting information, his
attempts at sharing leaks were also founded on a commitment to selecting
information. Still, his selection was significantly more programmatic
and consisted largely of sharing all information, except for information
about sources (or even knowing, as the technological infrastructure
behind WikiLeaks was designed to completely protect leakers); this still
constitutes a decision to share only certain information.

Either way, [this decision amounts to a **political** and **strategic**
commitment]{.underline}. Terranova explains the stakes well when she
describes the circulation of images as a type of warfare:

The hyperreal does not really involve a metaphysics of being and
appearance so much as a kind of [information ecology]{.underline} which
also [includes a dimension of **warfare**]{.underline}---a warfare [to
determine the **differential power** and **dominance** of some types of
images over others]{.underline}.24

Alongside images, [**all texts** and **information** are subjected to
this dimension of warfare that differentiates their **efficacy** and
**ability** to reformulate flows and networks]{.underline}. It is not
merely the bits of information that determine their efficacy but their
selection and differential relation.

The specific politics and strategy of pure transparency ultimately turn
against themselves on two levels. On the level of truth, such a
commitment can never guarantee the secrecy of the leaker while producing
technologies that coax information from organizations. The same secrecy
tax that burdens corporations and governments also causes individuals to
reveal their secrets. On the level of effect, then, any technological
and social system for supporting leaks is forced to engage in these
complex networks and texts, in short, to decide what individuals'
secrecy matters and what secrecy does not matter. The problem then
becomes an undecidable political question. This is not to say that it is
a priori negative but that such an act constitutes an opening rather
than a necessarily efficacious politics.

With the belief in an abstract machine that moves unwaveringly toward
the end of secrecy or the belief that this decision can be avoided
through technology, we risk that information becomes its own truth.
Leaks become, as raw data, an objectification of the sociopolitical
relations that produce, use, and manipulate information and thus mark
and measure truth itself. [Information]{.underline} thus
[becomes]{.underline} what Foucault describes as [a **regime of
veridiction**]{.underline}, which "in fact, is not a law of truth, but
[the **set of rules** enabling one to **establish which statements in a
given discourse can be described as true or false**]{.underline}."25
Information and the [technologies]{.underline} of antisecrecy [establish
both the **truth** and the very rules enabling one to **ascertain** the
truth]{.underline}. [The regime of transparency in an informational
economy becomes not about the **quality** or **effect** of information
but about its **mere possession**]{.underline},
**[existence]{.underline}**, [and **exposure**]{.underline}. This is not
to downplay the importance of these leaks or to minimize the great risks
and costs individuals have taken on to bring this information to the
public but rather to insist that [this information alone **does not
guarantee** an effective politics]{.underline}.

RESISTANCE AFTER THEORY

In this light, we can understand the media as "tactical" insomuch as all
sides of these conflicts seize upon media, their reuse, and their
reconfiguration for the purposes of war and conflict. Raley, commenting
on the Critical Art Ensemble and Lovink's, among others', conception of
tactical media, states, "Tactical media comes so close to its core
informational and technological apparatuses that protest in a sense
becomes the mirror image of its object, its aesthetic replicatory and
reiterative rather than strictly oppositional."26 While the focus of
tactical media is largely on art and protest practices, with cyberwar,
media become tactical to all involved, including states and armies.
Despite these different forces who are now involved in using media
tactically, all of them appear caught in this system that Raley
outlines, where the use of these media requires that one mirror the
object of intervention. When media become objects of war and tactics, it
becomes impossible to step outside these processes of mediatization and
its disfiguration in the face of this violence.27

To understand the media as tactical under the constant siege of cyberwar
requires taking the McLuhanesque insight that "[the **media** is the
**message**]{.underline}" in the most deconstructed sense possible.
[There is **no longer any meaningful way** to separate the
two]{.underline}. Perhaps before the rise of computers, when command
functioned on the level of a physical machine and data could not touch
it (e.g., no message could be sent over the radio that would turn it
off---or worse yet, turn a car off while one is driving), a separation
could be made between media and message. The rise of reprogrammable
media that combine data and command requires abandoning any distinction
between media and message. [Subjects and truth are produced through
the]{.underline} topologies and [**texts** that send various messages
through a multiplicity of media]{.underline}. [Tactics]{.underline} in
relation to media [can]{.underline} then [truly **no longer be
oppositional**]{.underline}, [for there can be **no transcendental
space** from which a stable space of opposition could be
constructed]{.underline}. Rather, [the **only tactical movement** that
remains is to discover the **outsides** that are **folded inside
texts**]{.underline}, networks, [and the **unstable interface** between
them]{.underline}. But, the translation of local information to global
networks always risks perversions, corruptions, and interventions.

[Despite]{.underline}, [or perhaps even because of]{.underline}, [the
**difficulty** of acting or deciding within these complex global
networks]{.underline}, [there is a **great appeal** to]{.underline} the
possibility of controlling situations through instantaneously knowable
surfaces. Data appear as a vast field of computable truth. But the
coherence of these surfaces is always belied by the vulnerability and
contingency they contain within and the instability of the subjects
whose traces exist in these vast fields of data. Still, many discourses,
including those of information transparency, continually claim the
efficacy of managing surface effects. Rather than recognizing those
forces, which resist control, a host of actors
[increasingly]{.underline} seek out [**finer-grained modes** of
analysis]{.underline}, [holding on to the **fallacy** that everything
today is **flowing** and **visible**]{.underline}.

Chris Andersen, a prominent technology journalist, has stated the belief
in these analytic modes of knowing in its most radical [and]{.underline}
succinct form. In an argument analogous to Greenberg's claims of a
coming transparency, Andersen states that the age of huge data sets
means [that we **no longer need models** or **theories** of the world
and instead can]{.underline} "**[run the data]{.underline}**" [in real
time]{.underline}:

Out with every theory of human behavior, from linguistics to sociology.
**[Forget]{.underline}** taxonomy, **[ontology]{.underline}**, and
psychology. [**Who knows why people do what they do**?]{.underline} [The
point is **they do it**]{.underline}, [and we can **track** and
**measure** it with **unprecedented fidelity**]{.underline}. [With
enough data]{.underline}, [the numbers **speak for
themselves**]{.underline}. The big target here isn't advertising,
though. It's science. The scientific method is built around testable
hypotheses. These models, for the most part, are systems visualized in
the minds of scientists. . . . But faced with massive data, this
approach to science---hypothesize, model, test--- is becoming
obsolete.28

For Andersen, [we do not need to know **why** things happen but merely
be able to **predict** them]{.underline} in real time: [no
**theories**]{.underline}, [no **models**]{.underline}, [no
**interpretation**]{.underline}, [just a **pure flow of
data**]{.underline}. In many ways, it is the scientific version of Bill
Gates's fantasy of frictionless capitalism, but for Andersen, the
signifier of capital is gone too. His is a fantasy of an infinite flow
of information processed in real time, and the world constantly
re-created anew out of predicting algorithms. It is a utopia, a
nonplace, with no slowness and no topography that could hold information
into a theoretical system. Beyond theory, we no longer need categories,
only momentary statistical conglomerations. In this world, one need not
know or theorize gender, class, or even individual subjects; [everything
becomes an **individual record** in a large-scale database]{.underline}.

It is, in short, the fantasy of a world without cyberwar, a world beyond
cyberwar. [This utopian vision would only be possible if computation and
data were **perfectly secure** and always represented the world
**exactly**]{.underline}. [These descriptions]{.underline} of a pure
world of data-driven discovery [rest on the **fantasy** that all being
and becoming can be **perfectly encoded** as data]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} utopia [requires that all data be **perfectly
secure**]{.underline} and no accident, gap, or military force affect
this correspondence. [At the same time]{.underline}, [it is a fantasy of
the **utter success** of cyberwar]{.underline}, insomuch as it requires
that technicians, politicians, scientists, and bankers are able [to
extract data from every system]{.underline}. In sum, Andersen hopes for
a cyberwar that would end all cyberwars, an impossible cyberwar that
would defeat all resistances.

Andersen is not alone in this vision of the future. A whole field of
"hypothesis-free science" has gained traction in several disciplines.29
Advertisers, high-frequency stock traders, and security agencies all
mine massive stores of data to find customers, profits, and criminals
with no interest in theorizing what is being sought. Even Latour's actor
network theory appears committed to the tracing and recording of
surface-level phenomena that provide no theory aside from the method of
following an individual actor's own theory.30 Here, again, [information
**becomes its own veridiction**]{.underline}. [As long as the variables
correlate]{.underline}, [it **does not matter why** or
**how**]{.underline}, [and if the correlation is **off**]{.underline},
[the algorithm **updates automatically** to **improve accuracy for the
next round**]{.underline}.

### AT: Iteration

#### Machine Learning DA: Mechanistically weighing the consequences of fiated plans over and over makes debate algorithmically violent at the level of [form]{.underline}, which has [material significance]{.underline}. They've created [uniqueness]{.underline} for our offense because iteration is a [process]{.underline}, so disrupting one instance [jams the gears]{.underline}.

**Amoore, 22**---Professor of Human Geography in the Department of
Geography, Durham University (Louise, "Machine learning political
orders," Review of International Studies, February 15, 2022, dml)
\[language modifications denoted by brackets\]

Yet, what I propose here is that machine learning political orders
reverse Deleuze's dictum so that [the political problem is
**constituted** by the posited solution]{.underline}; or, the solution
gets the problem it deserves. [The]{.underline} retroactive
[logic]{.underline} of deep learning commonly [**begins** with the
identification of the **target output**]{.underline} from the model,
actively using the output signals that diverge or converge on the target
as an experimental space of modulation and adjustment. Though there are
multiple possible functions or 'solutions that will match the data', a
machine learning algorithm will use 'two sources of information to
select the best function: one is the dataset, and the other (the
inductive bias) is the assumptions that bias the algorithm to prefer
some functions over others'. 40 In order [to change the output
signal]{.underline}, [the **weights**]{.underline} within the hidden
layers of the neural network [**adjust** and **modify** the
signal]{.underline} that feeds forward to the next layer. Why does this
computational process matter for how the political problem and the
solution interact? The retroactive move from target solution to the
weights in the model means that [the parameters and dimensions of an
**intractably difficult** political question]{.underline} -- democracy,
pandemic response, border security, stability in the economy -- [become
configured as **infinitely adjustable** in relation to the
solution]{.underline}. Where the concept of problematisation suggests a
multiplicity of actions that could take place under the broad unifying
conditions of the formulation of the problem -- and, indeed a space for
normative deliberation of possible actions -- [this]{.underline}
retroactive [paradigm **forecloses** the multiplicity of plural
solutions to a **single target**]{.underline}, [and **reduces** the
framing of the political problem to the **weighting of
inputs**]{.underline}. Every adjustment or modification of the
parameters in the deep learning model is simultaneously an arrangement
of the political problem.

[To begin at the]{.underline} '**[end]{.underline}**', [with a **target
output**]{.underline} of the model, [is]{.underline} thus [to
**transform radically** what a political claim can be]{.underline} in
the world. For example, machine learning algorithms are increasingly
being deployed in immigration and borders decisions. The introduction of
machine learning in the sorting and classification of visa applications
does not merely automate some aspects of a previously human centred
bureaucratic process. More than this, the building of a model of the
flows of immigration claims actively constitutes what a border can be
and how it is understood as a political question. Moreover, [the space
to **challenge** the political formulation]{.underline}, such as for
example to question the racialised criteria that are applied to the
judgement on a person, [is]{.underline} also **[closed
out]{.underline}** by the machine learning process. In contrast to the
rules-based models that I described as engineering racialised
assumptions into association rules (for example, in Rakesh Agrawal's
data mining models), machine learning learns and generates new racial
formations from the data examples. With machine learning forms of
classification, there are no criteria as such; there are only inputs,
outputs, features, and functions. The model will also adjust with the
volatilities and geopolitical disruptions of migration, shifting its
thresholds so that the derived outputs are decoupled from the input data
of a visa application.

[There are **profound political consequences** of this]{.underline} more
generative and disruptive [approach]{.underline} to data inputs. In
2020, for example, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants
(JCWI) challenged the UK Home Office's use of a 'streaming algorithm' to
allocate visa applications to high, medium, and low levels of risk. The
JCWI identified the nationality data that were among the inputs to the
algorithm that scored some applicants as 'high risk', effectively
automating the decision to refuse the visa. JCWI and Foxglove Legal
successfully argued that the nationality data are proxies for race and,
therefore, in breach of the provisions of the Equality Act 2010.41 If
the algorithm had been a solely rules-based 'if ... and ... then ...
else' sequence, then the juridical removal of racist input data would
arguably substantially change the outputs of the system. However, with
machine learning it would be a mistake to conclude that the removal of a
racist input will excise the racialised propositions of the model. The
streaming of visa applications into risk-rated clusters, as exhibited in
the JCWI case brought by Foxglove, is an example of a solution defining
and configuring the political problem, so that immigration targets are
the starting point. When the input data are not variables (in the
functionalist sense) but features, the UK Home Office can agree to
remove a racist input (as they have done) while continuing to weight
other features in ways that revitalise racist inferences that were not
strictly present in the input data. For example, the weighting and
parameters applied to travel, to familial relationships, or to periods
of time spent outside the UK can serve to constitute a suspicious
population and to generate a red-flagged output. When the model is
learning about salient features and clusters from the dataset, its
racialised assumptions will exceed the categories of the input data and
extend to the groupings and communities created by the machine learning
process. It is not only the use of data from which race can be inferred,
but more significantly that the immigration algorithm forecloses the
potential of a person's future on the basis of a racism that pervades
the model all the way down.42 In short, [the question of what kinds of
**political actions**]{.underline}, [which **political
claims**]{.underline}, [or which **policy agendas** can be designed and
made]{.underline}, [is **condensed down** to the foreclosure of a target
output solution]{.underline}.

When the design of a machine learning model becomes a valued political
object in itself, the derivative outputs of the model are exchangeable
and tradeable beyond any specific defined political problem or 'domain'.
43 In common with the models built by Cambridge Analytica,
[**everything** becomes a function of deep learning to the point that
there are **no bad outputs**]{.underline} -- [even where this may be
**illness**]{.underline}, **[racism]{.underline}**,
**[death]{.underline}**, **[destitution]{.underline}**, **[social
hardship]{.underline}**, **[child poverty]{.underline}** -- [there are
only **target outputs** and the **adjustable parameters** of a
problem]{.underline}. Amid the loss of more than 170,000 lives to
COVID-19, the UK launched its national data strategy in 2020, describing
the 'high watermark of data use set during the pandemic' where
businesses, government, and organisations had been 'freed up' to
'innovate and experiment'. 44

A period marked by lack of effective emergency planning and horrifying
loss of life is thus articulated as a 'high watermark of data use'. In
his testimony before the UK House of Commons Science and Technology
Select Committee, former advisor to the prime minister, Dominic
Cummings, explained that conventional civil contingencies 'did not have
the data architecture', and that 'companies \[DeepMind\] had stuff we
could use off the shelf, hack it together for the NHS.' 45 Behind the
rhetoric of his testimony, Cummings's account does express the deep
faith placed in deep learning models to address the data gaps in
bureaucratic structures. On the day that he appeared before MPs,
Cummings released a photograph of a whiteboard used to map early
pandemic planning. Among the scrawled notes, a question is posed: 'who
do we not save?'. Viewed from the perspective of the building of machine
learning models for the pandemic -- or the 'hacking together' by private
tech companies -- the question of who will not be saved is but a mere
parameter in a model, to be adjusted in relation to NHS capacity. In the
event, this parameter was also a deeply racialised metric -- with people
of black and South Asian ethnic background four times more likely to die
from COVID-19 in the UK.46 In common with the racialised logics of the
immigration algorithm, the pandemic models did not need to begin with
race as a category or input to nonetheless generate a deeply racialised
model of algorithmic violence. [The]{.underline} machine learning
[model]{.underline} itself [has **extraordinary resilience** in the face
of **complete moral** and **political failures** because a **weight can
always be adjusted**]{.underline}, [a **threshold modified**, a
**parameter tweaked**]{.underline}. The question of 'who do we not
save?' is translated into the parameter of a model whose target outputs
are the starting point. [In]{.underline} a situation where there is a
[**total** and **abject failure** of policy and good
governance]{.underline}, the [innovation]{.underline} in data science
and AI [is **nonetheless fostered** by the racialised violence and
social turbulence that is generated]{.underline}. Whether this is
incorrect or unjust decisions made in an algorithmic benefits system,
poor judgements on policing deployment, or the catastrophic pursuit of a
modelled 'herd immunity', [machine learning political orders **learn
something** from the data generated by the volatility]{.underline}.

A similar sense of the productivity of fractured governance is present
in the UNHCR's statements that 'even in highly volatile and chaotic
environments', digital systems will 'radically expand the responses that
can be crafted for challenges in health care, education, migration, and
security'. 47 The organisation envisages machine learning technologies
within a process of 'competitive disruption' to what it calls 'obsolete'
institutional structures 'with legacies dating back to World War II'.
The flexibility and agility of a deep learning model -- deployed, for
example, in UNHCR's 'Project Jetson' predictive models of refugee
movements -- becomes a condition of possibility for the imagination of
adaptive digital humanitarian and pandemic response, so that social and
political relations are reconfigured as the parameters of a model.48

In each of the examples I describe above, functionally arranged
structures of postwar social and international orders are reimagined
along the dimensions of a machine learning universal function. That is
to say, a function that is immanently mappable from a target output to
the weightings of the layers of the problem. [To propose that a
policy]{.underline} or an institution [must deliver on a
function]{.underline} thus also [**shifts** its ground]{.underline} --
[for something to]{.underline} '**[function]{.underline}**' [it **no
longer needs to work** as such]{.underline}.49 As Debbie Lisle has
argued, the cultures of science and engineering mobilise a politics
within which '**[failure]{.underline}**' [itself is rendered
an]{.underline} '**[instructive experience]{.underline}**'. 50 Within a
machine learning logic, the instructive experience of failure permits
the model to learn those unknown things that are beyond the distribution
of data in a training dataset. Though machine learning orders cannot be
said to fail as such -- or at least the output of the model is never a
failure but only a signal -- the retroactive generation of political
problem from output solution means that the very idea that a neural net
can approximate any function becomes a powerful political idea. In
short, though these ideas of failure are ontologically distinct, they
become epistemically aligned; [there is **slippage** between failure as
learning]{.underline}, [and the idea that there can be **no ethical
failure**]{.underline}, [nor **catastrophic policy
failure**]{.underline}.

[At stake]{.underline} in retroactive design, then, [is not merely
that]{.underline} deep learning [algorithms are deployed to **govern
society**]{.underline}, [but rather that society comes to **understand
itself** and its **problems** through the lens of the **deep learning
model**]{.underline}. The [relations among people]{.underline},
[objects]{.underline}, [and space become rendered as features from which
something useful **can always be extracted**]{.underline}, from which a
function can always be found. However, [the plurality and multiplicity
of those relations]{.underline}, [and the potentiality for new or
alternative political projects to emerge]{.underline}, [is **radically
foreclosed**]{.underline} around the retroactive mapping from target
output to the weighting of parameters in a model. It is to the
usefulness of exposure to contingency that I now turn, with a discussion
of how technological trials became perennial and indefinite.

Trial by design: How the test became an indefinite trial

The concept of alpha and beta testing has its origins in IBM's 1950s
software development, when the 'A' test signalled the in-house testing
to improve the engineering and the 'B' test referred to the verification
through user engagement and development. [In]{.underline} his account of
Cold War America and the culture and politics of computers, Paul Edwards
describes [the emergence of cybernetic culture and its penetration of
**state** and **military thinking**]{.underline}. In the context of
Edwards's 'closed world' integration of a 'seamless web' of human and
machine systems, the engineer deploys [the **testing**
regime]{.underline} in a form that mirrors the hierarchical logics of
computers.51 As an engineering practice of the twentieth century, the
test [formed an **intrinsic part** of the rules-based and cybernetic
approaches to government]{.underline} and computer science. As Edwards
depicts the Cold War collaborations of IBM, RAND, and the aircraft
corporations, [the **process of political planning itself** became
an]{.underline} '**[if]{.underline}** ... **[then]{.underline}**'
[proposition]{.underline}, 'constructing a list of tests to perform',
[identifying failings as **information problems**]{.underline}, [and
creating **feedback loops**]{.underline} from test to engineer.52 In
this sense, the Cold War alliances between computer science,
mathematics, and the military state embodied a specific understanding of
testing as practice, and of errors as problems of fallible human
perception that could be corrected with machine systems.53

This conception of testing and the sequential procedures of the 'list of
tests to perform' is aligned with the rules-based
[computation]{.underline} and rules-based social and international
political orders I have described. It [is a conception of]{.underline}
the test that is deeply probabilistic and conceives as [testing as a
process concerned with the **calculation of
probabilities**]{.underline}. As Orit Halpern describes the
cyberneticians' practices, 'they focused on the ability to calculate the
probability that one set of interactions (the missile hitting the plane)
will occur, over other sets less likely but possible'. '[This is a
worldview composed of]{.underline} functionally similar entities --
black boxes', she writes, composed only of 'their [algorithmic actions
in **constant conversation** with each other producing a range of
probabilistic scenarios]{.underline}'. 54

Against this historical backdrop of probabilistic alpha and beta testing
within functionally similar entities, the rise of deep learning
algorithms is most profoundly possibilistic in its orientation to the
future.55 As a mode of political ordering, machine learning circumvents
modern notions of testing in science and engineering by turning to the
trial and trialling as experimental technology. The trial is a more
possibilistic approach precisely because it refutes the functionally
similar entities and probabilities Halpern denotes in cybernetics, and
it embraces instead the generation of multiple possible functions in
order to defer a decision on what is politically useful. Understood in
this way, the rise of trialling in contemporary machine learning has
more in common with the conduct of stress testing to anticipate
uncertainty in finance than it does with alpha and beta testing in
software engineering.56 The machine learning model dwells indefinitely
in its trial phase because it is designed and redesigned through its
exposure to people, objects, places, and scenes, perennially modifying
itself in response to what it has learned through its encounters. In
this way, the 'demo' as technological demonstration, has a close
relationship with the 'demos' as the people, the population and
democracy.57 'Our forms of technological testing and demoing', writes
Halpern, 'envision a world where artificial intelligences and computers
can replace the democracy that is now imagined to be obsolescent'. 58
[As deep learning models penetrate public space]{.underline}, for
instance in live facial recognition biometric systems in urban spaces,
at borders, and in military spaces, [**every trial** of a deep learning
model is also an **active reconfiguration** of that space as the model
adapts in response to the contingencies it yields]{.underline}.59

For example, in the world's first legal challenge to police use of
automated facial recognition algorithms (AFR), the appellant, Bridges,
argued that South Wales Police unlawfully extracted his biometric data
during two trials of the technology.60 Bridges had been subject to AFR
during a protest outside an arms fair in Cardiff in 2018, and during a
Christmas shopping trip in 2017, with each trial of the system storing
his biometric data, cross-matching with a watchlist, generating match
scores, and modifying the sensitivity of the model. The court of appeal
found in Bridges favour in 2020, following testimony from an expert
computer scientist whose account vividly illustrates how the trial
indelibly marks and recalibrates a gendered and racialised system. 'AFR
systems will have a higher error rate for women and people from black
and ethnic minority groups', he testified, and 'where an end user is
adjusting threshold values it may make the AFR system particularly
sensitive for some individuals. People from that ethnic group will be
wrongly matched more often.' Thus, the trial of AFR -- ongoing for a
seemingly indefinite period from 2017 -- will continue to generate
racialised outputs and clusters of suspicion, even where individual
biometric datasets are deleted. As Rocco Bellanova and Marieke de Goede
describe architectures of data analysis, 'the infrastructure aims at
defining the "right population" to be algorithmically governed.' 61 The
very communities who are already disproportionately targeted by the
state will experience an intensification of scrutiny and control. In
this way, the capacity of a person to be present, or to gather with
others, in public space is iteratively and intimately related to the
exposures of a machine learning model that is indefinitely trialled
across multiple spaces. Unlike the feedback loops of Edwards's Cold War
military-computer science collaborations, the error rate of the
biometrics are contingent on the shifting infrastructural thresholds and
parameters of the algorithm. Whereas the cybernetic mode of testing was
concerned with the engineering of human and machinic component parts,
the machine learning mode of indefinite trials makes the limit and the
threshold the object of the trial, so that setting sensitivities, moving
borders and boundaries reconfigures both algorithm and action.

In this way, the orientation of the indefinite trial is closer to an
experimental and open-ended process of design than it is to engineering.
The very etymology of design is from the Latin designare, to designate,
to mark out, and related to disegnare, to contrive or intend. It is
precisely this process of designating and marking out that I see at work
in the indefinite trials of deep learning technologies in cities, at
borders, in public space. Bruno Latour outlines a philosophy of design
in which 'design has been extended from the details of daily objects to
cities, landscapes, nations, cultures, bodies, genes.' 62 For Latour,
the practice of design is counterposed to historical notions of building
or engineering, so that 'things are no longer "made" or "fabricated",
but rather designed.' 'This was the old way', he writes, 'to build, to
construct, to destroy, to radically overhaul' through engineering.63 By
contrast, to design something, for Latour, is never to found something
radically new but always to seek perennial iterative modification, so
that 'it is never a process that begins from scratch: to design is
always to redesign.' It is for this reason -- the practices of design as
open-ended iterative modification, even as 'anti-revolutionary' -- that
I align contemporary machine learning models with design and not
strictly with engineering.64

Indeed, many contemporary deep learning practices such as 'transfer
learning' definitively reject 'handcrafting representations', in favour
of 'greedy exploration'. 65 Every action is a modification of the
residue that is already lodged within the layers of the model, it is
never a complete overhaul or disruption. As Latour suggests, 'to say
everything has to be designed and redesigned, it will never be
revolutionary'. 66 This foreclosure of something different, something
revolutionary, is a crucial problem in machine learning political
epistemes. As I have described, even where the practice of trialling a
model is found to be in breach of law, or where racist data inputs are
removed, still nothing revolutionary can emerge. For design can always
modify and adjust and move the threshold, each adjustment another
indelible mark, a marking out and a demarcation line. When Latour
concludes that 'designing is the antidote to founding, colonizing
establishing', I must disagree with him, for it is precisely colonising
in ways that incorporate ever-increasing layers, extend to ever more
domains of life, and dwell quietly in the violences of the modified
weight. What new or alternative politics can possibly emerge when every
potential pathway has already been narrowed to a mere parameter? It is
to the implications and potentials for alternative political futures
that I now turn in conclusion.

Design interruptions: Resisting machine learning worlds

In setting the themes that animate this Special Issue on disruption,
Nicole Grove posed the question 'what kind of worlds are in store for us
as algorithms disrupt forms of organisation and advocacy for more
equitable futures?'. 67 I have sought to map out how machine learning
actively incorporates the data from disrupted and fractured forms of
organisation, and why it is that advocacy for alternative political
futures becomes foreclosed in the logics of retroactivity and perennial
trialling. I have suggested that a machine learning political episteme
-- one that eschews rulesbased computational and political orders -- is
profiting from the undoing of postwar international and social
institutions, from the deep neural networks powering the Vote Leave
campaign to the so-called 'digital transformation' of the pandemic NHS.
While, of course, I am not nostalgic for cybernetic worlds of
rules-based computation and the liberal international order,
nevertheless it is the case that notions of democratic life, human
rights, and social ethics also grew amid such rules oriented orders.
Where machine learning political orders are precisely profiting from the
undoing of rights and collective public institutions, there are new
challenges for the politics of resistance.

What happens to the space for resistance amid the power of the machine
learning algorithm? What are the possibilities for reopening the futures
that are condensed and foreclosed in the output of a deep neural
network? Where machine learning algorithms are increasingly learning
from the features of social scenes and the gathering of people in public
space, is collective politics reduced to a being together that is merely
the clustering of attributes? As Judith Butler has put the question,
'what does it mean to act together when the conditions for acting
together are devastated or falling away?'. 68 Such questions are more
urgent and acute because the threats to the rights to protest and
freedoms to assemble are intensified by a machine learning order that
absorbs the attributes of collective action. In her treatise on
political assembly, Butler imagines that the 'gathering signifies in
excess of what is said' and that 'popular assemblies form unexpectedly
and dissolve', exercising a 'plural and performative right to appear'.
69 Yet, this plural and performative excess of the gathering of
vulnerable bodies in public space is precisely under threat from the
retroactive and trialling logics of the machine learning polity.

When the machine learning algorithm becomes the mise-en-scène of the
public square, the means of arranging the scene and extracting the
features, what political claim can be heard that is not already
extracted and scored, and who can make it? [The **task for
resistance**]{.underline}, I suggest, [is to **interrupt the ordering**
of the political scene in order to ask how it **might be
otherwise**]{.underline}. My emphasis on interruption consciously
rejects the vocabularies of disruption that animate the force of
disruptive technologies and 'push on the fracture until it breaks' tech
industry cultures. [To interrupt the scene is to **resist its very
condition of appearance**]{.underline}, [to **locate the breaches** in
algorithmic arrangements and to show how they **could be
otherwise**]{.underline}. As Walter Benjamin notes of Bertolt Brecht's
device of 'interruption' in epic theatre, 'the truly important thing is
to discover the conditions of life', where this discovery 'takes place
through the interruption of happenings'. 70 [To interrupt the scene of a
machine learning political order would be to **confront the plural
branching pathways** that could have yielded a different output and to
**amplify** those branches as political decisions]{.underline}. [In
**every** arrangement of a machine learning model there are the
**traces** of the **rejected alternative**]{.underline}. Brecht's device
of [interruption presents]{.underline} the observer with [the traces of
what **could have been present**]{.underline}, with the actor performing
'[in such a way that the alternative emerges **as clearly as
possible**]{.underline}', [allowing]{.underline} '[**other
possibilities** to be inferred]{.underline}' [even while]{.underline}
she \[[they]{.underline}\] '[represent]{.underline}s [**one** out of the
possible variants]{.underline}'. 71 In this way, the
[interruption]{.underline} of the scene [**works against the grain** of
the algorithm's reduction to **one visible output**]{.underline},
showing the contingency and multiplicity of the one out of many possible
variants. [Here lies a **significant form** of resistance]{.underline};
[to **amplify** the branching points as moments where things **could
have been otherwise**]{.underline}, [where other possibilities **could
be inferred**]{.underline}; [and to **refuse the reduction** of
political difficulty to **one** that is the **output**]{.underline}.

[To resist being governed by a machine learning political order will
necessitate naming the harms]{.underline} -- [**beyond** the conventions
of]{.underline} privacy, data protection, and **[existing bodies of
rights]{.underline}** -- [of the foreclosure of alternative political
futures]{.underline}. Though the machine learning political orders I
have described close off political contestation and unheard claims,
under the figure of the machine learning model there remains a teeming
politics. [When the solution precedes the political
problem]{.underline}, [the adjustment of parameters is also a **real**
and **violent modification** of people's lives]{.underline} -- as
migrants, as benefit claimants, as people gathering in the city square.
It is for this reason that [the]{.underline} deep learning [practice of
modifying]{.underline} '**[weights]{.underline}**' [in the model **must
be rendered heavier** and **more burdensome** than the **lightness** of
an adjustment implies]{.underline}. [The weight in a machine learning
model is **not merely**]{.underline} a **[technical]{.underline}**
weight on a connection in the neural net. [It is the full burden and
heaviness of a **rejected visa application**]{.underline}, [a **past
facial biometric** captured at a protest]{.underline}, [a **refused
welfare claim**]{.underline}, [the extracted features of the
**refugee**]{.underline}. In her compelling account of how colonial
formations endure, Ann Laura Stoler foregrounds the 'enduring fissure'
and the 'durable mark' of imperial duress.72 Stoler's affecting thought
about 'duress' foregrounds the 'hardened, tenacious qualities of
colonial effects' and 'endurance' in the 'capacity to "hold out" and
"last", to endure as a countermand to "duress" and its damaging
qualities'. 73 The weight of the machine learning algorithm could be
freighted with the heaviness and endurance of Stoler's imperial duress.
[**Each adjustment** and **modification** of the model a **squeezing**
and a **tightening** of the conditions of liveability]{.underline} of a
political space, a community. Every indefinite trial a trial in the
fullest sense of something that is borne by vulnerable bodies.

### AT: Reflexivity/Skills

#### Their info reflexivity claims are a [smokescreen]{.underline} for algorithmic control. 

**Tazzioli, 21**---Lecturer in Politics and Technology, Goldsmiths
University of London (Martina, "Technologies of Control and
Infrastructures of Redistribution," e-flux #123, December 2021, dml)

A well-known slogan that emerged from the disability movement during the
1990s goes: "Nothing about us without us." It stresses that no policy
should be adopted without fully involving those who are affected by that
policy. Nowadays, it is a catchphrase used across different fields and
institutional settings, signaling that "[participation]{.underline}"
[has become a **placeholder** for **inclusion**]{.underline},
**[democracy]{.underline}**, [and **horizontal decision-making
processes**]{.underline}. Yet, [what does]{.underline}
"[participation]{.underline}" in a given system [mean when the
**epistemic-political codes**]{.underline}, the ability to maneuver, and
the stakes of the participation [are **set in advance** by the party in
control]{.underline}? So-called "participatory programs," like surveys
and other forms of data acquisition, have been used extensively by
humanitarian agencies since the 1990s, and more recently have shifted
into systems for practicing what I instead call "participatory
confinement." In such systems, [individuals are **nudged** and
**encouraged** to **actively participate** in their own confinement and
governmentality]{.underline}, "**[for their own good]{.underline}**."
Christopher Kelty, a scholar of science studies and anthropology,
rightly claims that [this]{.underline} sort of "participation [is more
often a **formatted procedure** by which autonomous individuals attempt
to reach **calculated consensus**]{.underline}." [Not only are the
**goals** and **forms** of participation often **preestablished** and
**surreptitiously imposed**]{.underline}, [but individuals are also **de
facto** pushed to **corroborate**]{.underline}, **[contribute
to]{.underline}**, [and **improve** mechanisms of **confinement** and
**coercion**]{.underline}. Here, I focus on refugee humanitarianism as a
case study for coming to grips with modes of participatory confinement
as a systematic political technology of governmentality.

Modes of participatory confinement in refugee humanitarianism are
inflected by clear-cut asymmetric relations between asylum seekers on
one side, and humanitarian actors on the other. This initial condition
and its trend towards reform by way of inviting participation is
reminiscent of the diagnosis of prison reform by Michel Foucault in a
lecture he gave in 1976. Furnishing an anticipatory example of
participatory confinement, he writes: "[There is an attempt to **make
prisoners themselves participate** in devising the very programmes for
their punishment]{.underline}, through the prisoners' councils and so
on. This is the idea that [the individual]{.underline}, [**singly** or
**collectively**]{.underline}, [is meant to **accept the punitive
procedure**]{.underline}." Nowadays, [participatory
approaches]{.underline} are center stage on the agendas of international
agencies and NGOs in the context of the so-called "refugee crisis" in
Europe. They [continue to operate with the **same neoliberal logics** of
prior reforms to systems of punishment and control that **performatively
invite** the exploited to **frame the forms** of that
exploitation]{.underline}, [while **actually ceding no
power**]{.underline} to the "participant."

Furthermore, invoking a term from Tiziana Terranova, participatory
confinement in refugee humanitarianism can also be considered a form of
"soft control." Asylum seekers are increasingly asked to answer
questionnaires and provide detailed information to humanitarian actors
about their coping strategies, migratory journeys, the logistics of
border crossing, and their protection needs. These activities are
presented to refugees as an opportunity to improve their individual
situation and, at the same time, the asylum system at large; in
actuality, they just increase the control that the system has over
refugees. In The Undercommons, Fred Moten and Stephano Harney refer to a
similar process as [the]{.underline} "**[invitation to
governmentality]{.underline}**" [which subjects are **repeatedly
exposed** to]{.underline}. Elaborating on this notion, it can be argued
that this "invitation" in the context of humanitarian participatory
programs also [involves pushing subjects to **perform unpaid labor** by
**providing feedback**]{.underline}. [They thus **implicitly consent**
to being sites for the **extraction of knowledge**]{.underline}, which
is [used]{.underline} by NGOs [to **further enforce** modes of control
and governance]{.underline}. Speaking of [an invitation to
governmentality]{.underline} in these terms also [sheds light on the
multiple forms of **interpellation** that individuals are subject
to]{.underline}, [and how they are nudged to participate]{.underline}
"**[for their own good]{.underline}**." That is, [the invitation to
governmentality that individuals are exposed to in different contexts
often turns into]{.underline} a form of **[subtle
coercion]{.underline}**.

**Schneider, 22**---assistant professor of media studies at the
University of Colorado Boulder (Nathan, "Governable Stacks against
Digital Colonialism," tripleC 20 (1): 19-36, 2022, dml)

[Theorists and practitioners of anticolonial resistance have
**persistently stressed** the centrality of **self-governance** in
everyday life as both the **means** and the **end** of their
movements]{.underline}, [**alongside** acts of outright
insurrection]{.underline}. [By self-governance I mean]{.underline} to
evoke other terms like autonomy, autogestión, autogestió, community
control, self-determination, self-management, self-organising,
self-rule, sovereignty, swaraj, and more -- together encompassing [how
groups of people become **impervious** and **intolerable** to those who
want to govern them by governing themselves]{.underline}. [The
aspiration to be]{.underline} "**[ungovernable]{.underline}**" [has
appeared]{.underline} among thinkers ranging from the philosophers
Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben (Thaning, Gudmand-Høyer and Raffnsøe
2016) to former Black Panther Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin (Anderson 2020),
each seeking to assert the vital personhood of people caught in
dehumanising systems. Such systems utilise "governmentality" to extend
their power into subjects' lives (Li 2007). Scholars of governance tend
to regard it as something done to -- or at best, for -- most people,
rather than something they do themselves (Levi-Faur 2012).
[Self-governance against colonialism is]{.underline} something else,
[something people do to govern **while becoming
ungovernable**]{.underline}.

To become ungovernable under digital colonialism, how should we be
learning to self-govern?

I pose this question while observing that the platforms most available
for online organising are not well-suited for self-governing; tools for
basic group decision-making are not widespread, and nor are mechanisms
to hold those in authority accountable (Schneider 2021). The design of
social platforms inclines toward enabling the governmentality of
platform owners, aided by their user-administrator proxies, rather than
user governance that could turn against the owners' interests. Campaigns
of digital resistance often employ the same colonial firms they oppose.
[Those confronting digital colonialism today might]{.underline}
therefore [**orient** their struggles]{.underline}, [as **past
anticolonial movements** have]{.underline}, [by **rediscovering** and
**reinventing** the art of self-governance]{.underline}.

[Settler colonialism and digital]{.underline} "[user
experience]{.underline}" [both involve]{.underline} what legal scholar
Sanjukta Paul (2020) calls [the]{.underline} "**[allocation of
coordination rights]{.underline}**". [Regimes dictate who has the right
to **self-organise**]{.underline}, or not, [and under what
conditions]{.underline}. Micro-targeted discrimination singles out
individuals for exposure to exploitative advertising, stifling public
outcry (Benjamin 2019). [Algorithmic decisions]{.underline} about
public-service provision [make it harder for harmed communities to put
**collective pressure** on individual decision makers]{.underline}
(Eubanks 2018). Humanitarian organisations collect data about refugees,
which the refugees themselves cannot access while the organisations use
it for future fundraising (Madianou 2019). Individual users might have
options on a platform to access or delete their own personal data, yet
platform companies alone can develop products from the users' data in
the aggregate (Couldry and Mejias 2019a). Platforms impose the
developers' cultural norms, projecting a false universality that leaves
little space for user communities to practice their own cultures (Kwet
2019; Milan and Treré 2019; Duarte et al. 2019). And at least [as much
as platforms might enable **activist organising**]{.underline}, [they
introduce new varieties of **surveillance** and
**repression**]{.underline} (Tufekci 2017; Canella 2018).

"[Governance is **what we are fighting for**]{.underline}",
[writes]{.underline} Black Lives Matter co-founder Alica
**[Garza]{.underline}** (2020, 273). "[We are fighting for the right to
make decisions for our own lives and to ensure that right for
others]{.underline}". [Her movement's protests have made **whole
sections of cities** ungovernable through daring]{.underline},
[fraught]{.underline}, [fleeting attempts to implement alternatives to
policing]{.underline}. [Progress goes **slowly**]{.underline}, [with
**setbacks** and **blowback**]{.underline}, [until **seemingly all at
once** even those in power **no longer have any choice** but to build on
the fragile experiments from the streets]{.underline}.

What would [community-governed technologies]{.underline} look like, and
how [can]{.underline} they **[resist exploitation]{.underline}**? I
introduce the concept of "governable stacks" as a means of ungovernable
organising under digital colonialism. From here, this article reviews
how anti-colonial leaders and thinkers have thought about
self-governance. It then turns to the perils of recent failures among
resistance movements to self-govern under digital colonialism. The
following two sections present governable stacks in detail as a concept
and as a practice.

2\. The Trouble of Governance

"[Governance is the extension of whiteness on a global
scale]{.underline}", [write]{.underline} Stefano [**Harney**
and]{.underline} Fred **[Moten]{.underline}** (2013, 56). NGOs are the
"laboratories" of governance, which turns democracy into labour. It is a
cheap sort of domination because the subjects do it to themselves:
"Governance arrives to manage self-management, not from above, but from
below" (55). [Harney and Moten reply with a politics of
**refusal**]{.underline} and "being without interests", a call to
imagine what it would mean "[to struggle **against
governance**]{.underline}" (57): "We are [the **general antagonism** to
politics looming outside]{.underline} every attempt to politicise,
**[every imposition of self-governance]{.underline}**" (20).

Harney and Moten's polemic can claim many ancestors. They cite Frantz
Fanon, who stressed the "spontaneity" of popular uprisings, the
ungovernable reaction of the lumpen-proletariat, "the most spontaneous
and the most radically revolutionary forces of a colonized people"
(Fanon 1961/1963, 81). They celebrate the ungovernable villages of
escaped slaves in the Americas, including the maroons of
Saint-Domingue's high hills, whose raids did not wait for Touissant
Louverture's command but made possible the eventual independence of
Haiti (Lebrón Ortiz 2020).

"You know, I love C.L.R. James", says Moten in passing (Harney and Moten
2013, 155). James, the Trinidadian chronicler of Louverture's revolution
and an instigator of others from Tanzania to Detroit, praised
spontaneity as well. His book with Grace Lee Boggs and Pierre Chaulieu,
Facing Reality, describes a "most conscious and finished opposition to
the parliamentary procedure" found among dockworkers. By their account,
"dockers do not like votes"; "they sense the general sentiment and act
on that" (James, Lee and Chaulieu 1958/1974, 121-122). What holds sway
is a worker's je ne sais quoi ability to capture the attention of the
others, regardless of role or position: decision without institution.

[The age of networks has only **deepened the allure** of spontaneity
among radical theorists]{.underline}, [as with]{.underline} Michael
[**Hardt** and]{.underline} Antonio **[Negri's]{.underline}** admiration
for the "**[multitude]{.underline}**" [and]{.underline} the
"**[assembly]{.underline}**" against fixed organisational forms (2017),
or Manuel Castells's (2015) "networks of outrage and hope". [Underground
tracts]{.underline} from [such]{.underline} pseudonymous figures [as the
**Invisible Committee**]{.underline} (2009) and the Vitalist
International (2019) [long for **rebellions** whose disorder is their
vindication]{.underline}, while adrienne maree brown (2017) presents
spontaneous self-organisation in nature as a theory of social change.
[Each seems to profess that organisational forms of revolutions past
**no longer compute**]{.underline} -- [in part because we now have
computers]{.underline}.

An antithesis: over a century ago, Vladimir Lenin (1902/1961) regarded
those "who kneel in prayer to spontaneity" as a "fungus" among
revolutionaries. Where there is spontaneity among the masses, it obtains
power only through an organised and disciplined vanguard party, such as
the one he would lead in Russia. Rosa Luxemburg (1904) recoiled at the
rigidity of Lenin's vanguard, one moulded by the discipline of the
factory, the army, and the bureaucracy. She called for a movement that
would be "supple as well as firm", capacious enough to hold the full
humanity of its participants. Yet a communist regime came to pass in
Germany not through her homegrown movement but through Soviet tanks
rolling into Berlin. Those tanks emanated from Stalin's dictatorship;
Luxemburg was right to worry about a vanguard modelled on industrial
discipline. What she longed for remains so often elusive: a movement
firm enough to gain power yet supple enough to wield it humanely.

Now, stop and go back, and reconsider those apparently kneeling before
spontaneous resistance, against the strictures of governance. Synthesise
the dialectic. **[Fanon]{.underline}** also [warned against
the]{.underline} "**[cult]{.underline}**" [of spontaneity]{.underline}
(1961/1963, 130) [and stressed that the]{.underline} "enlightening of
[consciousness]{.underline}" [necessary for liberation is]{.underline}
"[**only possible** within the **framework** of an
organisation]{.underline}, [and inside]{.underline} the
**[structure]{.underline}** of a people" (142). He held that
[spontaneous energies must find **institutional cohesion**]{.underline}.
[**C.L.R. James** affirmed]{.underline}, in his final interview, "I
believe [you **must** have an **organisation**]{.underline}"
(Fitzpatrick 1989) in the Leninist sense. He celebrated the Paris
Commune as a forerunner of the Russian soviets, regarding that uprising
as "first and foremost a democracy" (Johnson 1946). And in "Every Cook
Can Govern", an essay that took its title from a phrase of Lenin's,
James recommends to workers the ancient Athenian method of ruling by
sortition, selecting authorities from the citizenry by lot. [The
anticolonial organisation]{.underline}, in this light, [must be creative
and accountable]{.underline}, [reaching into the lives of those who are
self-governing and also outward as a model to others]{.underline}. As
Adom Getachew (2019) documents, the independence movements James helped
to inspire sought not just nation states but a new order of global
governance.

Grace Lee Boggs was long a fellow traveller with James in the factions
and divisions of sectarian Marxism, a student and friend of Third World
revolutionaries (Boggs and Boggs 1974; Boggs 1998/2016). She and James
Boggs thought their way into a "politics of personal development" (King
2017) that rejected partisan orthodoxies in favour of a more iterative
"dialectical humanism", in which political visions and the people who
hold them evolve together through struggle. From the systems thinker
Margaret J. Wheatley came Boggs's frequent affirmation of "critical
connections" over "critical mass" (Boggs and Kurashige 2012, 50) -- a
conviction that the germ of seismic change lies in the thick
relationality of how people choose to self-organise day to day. She
drifted from Leninism, but the imperative of self-governance only
deepened.

Later in life, Boggs's attention turned from achieving state communism
to commoning, the work of people continually discovering what they are
seeking to achieve by stewarding shared projects and resources. She
became a mentor to veterans of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street and its
"leaderless" travails. After her passing, Rodrigo Nunes (2021,
Chapter 1) in Brazil envisions post-2011 movement organisation with
naturalistic language like "nebula" and "ecology". He confesses
attempting to recuperate a kind of vanguardism, a "networked Leninism"
-- before concluding with an insistence that above all activists should
"think and act ecologically" (Conclusion).

In Boggs we see the origins of passages about mycelia and butterflies
and trees in the writing of her disciple adrienne maree brown (2017).
brown's "emergent strategy" for activists revels not in conflict with
corporate opponents but in apparitions of friendship in online threads
and tips for weaving consensus processes. Seeking to transcend "protest
politics", Boggs described her mentorship of younger organisers as

projecting and initiating struggles that involve people at the
grassroots in assuming the responsibility for creating new values,
truths, infrastructures, and institutions that are necessary to build
and govern a new society (Boggs and Kurashige 2012, 68).

Fred [Moten]{.underline} acknowledges the Boggses' influence as an
example of unpayable debts (Harney and Moten 2013, 153). What he [and
Harney offer in place of governance]{.underline} is
"**[study]{.underline}**", a term of art that is also resolutely plain,
in reference to [the learning and planning that takes place among groups
of people in spaces that are ungovernable by reigning
institutions]{.underline}. [Like the **maroons of Saint-Domingue** or
the **American South**]{.underline}, [study **surely involves an order
of its own**]{.underline}, [apart from the colonial
university]{.underline}, [a practice of insurgent
self-rule]{.underline}. The maroons of study, for Harney and Moten, are
never-settled communities of criminal exodus. [But their maroons
undertake]{.underline} "**[fugitive planning]{.underline}**". [They
study to plan]{.underline}, [they plan so they can find the space and
time to study]{.underline}. [To do **either**]{.underline}, [and
therefore **both**]{.underline}, [there **must be something** of the
self-governance Harney and Moten **seem to disavow**]{.underline}.

[These anticolonial thinkers see the trouble with governance in the
sense of **governmentality**]{.underline}, [a **back-door aid to
domination**]{.underline}. And [yet they also assert the **otherwise
troublesome** kind of self-governing]{.underline}, [the kind that is
**ungovernable** and **opaque** and **maroon** from the vantage point of
the imperial capitals]{.underline} -- and, now, of the colonial
platforms. The next section recalls how platforms have enabled their
users to feel ungovernable and powerful for a time. But without the
means of self-governing, those sensations have been fleeting.

3\. Virality as a Colonising Strategy

I once entered the office of a labour organiser to find her there, head
in her hands. She was running a campaign in the ever-shifting,
just-in-time, atomised theatre of urban retail. Why so down? The workers
were migrating to Instagram. At least on Facebook, you could corral them
into groups, you could post updates. On Instagram, every message had to
be hilarious or enraging or gorgeous if you wanted it to reach them.
Sometimes the information an organiser needs to share is not any of
those. But isn't it still important?

Without persistent groups or organisations, Instagram's eminent form of
shared experience is the viral image, which circulates an affective
impression of shared experience. To spread, the image must be the kind
of image that would spread, according to the tastes of the poster's
followers and the secret churning of the platform's engineering. An
announcement for next week's union meeting may not qualify. An organiser
trying to strengthen workers' bonds isn't interested in infecting them
like a virus.

The rise of ubiquitous social media rode on waves of protest, from the
Battle of Seattle to the Arab Spring. Individual voices, linked with
hashtags, seemed to herald collective liberation (Papacharissi 2015).
And yet, despite the outpourings of promise and hope and near-term
victories, those digitally mediated uprisings have fallen under the
police of Mohamed Morsi and the bombs of Bashar al-Assad, the famines of
the Yemeni civil war and the warlords of Libya. 'Pirate' political
parties arising out of online protest have tended to collapse upon their
first encounter with power, if they ever get there.

At the Occupy Wall Street encampment in 2011, reporters would arrive and
be transfixed by the media centre -- the nerve centre, the centre of
power because it was media (Schneider 2013, 36). And media was powerful
indeed, as it drew thousands upon thousands of people into what began as
a small, precarious protest. Videos of police attacking activists, in
particular, bred sympathy and participants, and a feeling that the
movement might be on the brink of sparking some kind of revolution. At
least at first. By the following year, the videos didn't work the same
way. As an activist monitoring the analytics data noticed at the time,
"Riot porn is losing its luster for mass online consumption" (Schneider
2012). As the social-media attention waned, so did the movement's
confidence.

The likes of Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, and Xi Jinping discovered how
to outlast digital insurgencies, obscuring outbreaks of dissent under a
deluge of obfuscation. Spontaneity is a commodity online, and empires
can produce it for themselves.

Experience with multitudinous networks has led their early enthusiasts
to call for more self-ordering. Hardt and Negri (2017) clarify their
embrace of leaderless movements by stressing the need for "the
institutionalization of free and democratic forms of life", organised
enough to be "able to take hold of the common" (xx). To Zeynep Tufekci
(2017), the networked "signal" of movements can be self-defeating
without organisational "capacity".

[The **classic strategy** of imperial domination]{.underline} -- divide
et impera, divide and conquer -- [proposes to dominate by training
subjects to feel an **illusion of power** through their conflicts with
one another]{.underline}. On colonial platforms, too, [users direct
their energy **for** and **against** each other]{.underline}, [gaining
**influence** and **affirmation** through their **jousts**
and]{.underline}, [in so doing]{.underline}, [identifying themselves
**ever more deeply** with the **non-transferable reputation** they
obtain]{.underline} on the platforms. [Virality is **fleeting** if it
ever happens]{.underline}, [but the **possibility** is
there]{.underline}, [so we pursue it]{.underline}. Before long we have
recapitulated the final scene of the 1954 McCarthyist blockbuster On the
Waterfront, in which the dockworkers flee from their union's problems
into the arms of the boss, newly able to experience their collective
exploitation as individual liberation.

### Perm---Stacks---2AC

#### Perm: [Stack]{.underline} the aff and the alt. Mutual exclusivity is [counterproductive]{.underline}; in the cybernetic era, it's [more productive]{.underline} to assume [partial interlinkages]{.underline} between movements and focus on [layering]{.underline} them through [stacktivist praxis]{.underline}. Not everyone has to be a stacktivist for the perm to solve!

**Lovink, 20**---founder of the Institute of Network Cultures at the
Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Geert, "Principles of
Stacktivism," tripleC 18 (2): 716-724, 2020, dml) \[emojis in original
article...\]

[We can]{.underline} also [read The Stack as a **pedagogical
framework**]{.underline} within the Bauhaus tradition as a proposal [for
a **general design principle**]{.underline}, as John Thackara has
recently done, updating the Bauhaus foundation course for the age of
global warming\[12\]. [As an **abstract model**]{.underline} describing
the architecture of the Internet, [the stack provides us with a **useful
spatial division** of layers]{.underline} such as protocols, data,
applications and user interfaces. Bratton's notion of The Stack comes
out of the US postmodern literary tradition of cognitive mapping
(Jameson), which seeks to make intelligible (and containable) complex
processes. Bratton combines this approach with decades long attempts to
visualise the vertical integration of technologies drawn in 2D, with
maps of networks that strive to capture relations between the different
players. His aim is [to produce a **general network theory** able to
provide **deeper insights** in the dynamics of power]{.underline}:
blowing up 2D tech engineering plans to a 3D dimension able to modulate
planetary transformation.

Benjamin Bratton also invites us to think tech in relation to
geo-politics and location. At the same time [The Stack can be seen as
**method**]{.underline}, [a **mechanism**]{.underline}. However, the
book is [**consciously vague** about how material infrastructure and
ideology **relate**]{.underline}. In the light of Trump, Putin and Xi
Jinping, Bratton's global engineer seems a tragic, retrograde figure. At
best The Stack works well as a multi-disciplinary guideline of past
globalist techno-social practices that, ironically, have become outdated
since 2016, the year of its publication and the year of Brexit and
Trump. For all its ambition to delineate the geo-political contours of
techno-operations supposedly occurring on a planetary scale, the book
settles with an oddly depoliticised aesthetic imaginary.

[How can we **free up** The Stack from its current confinements and turn
into an **improvised dance**?]{.underline} [Let's define a
**stacktivism**]{.underline}, [an **active** and **reflective reading**
of stacks-on-the-move, that is **not afraid** of the
subject]{.underline} (formerly known as user) [and involves
action]{.underline}, [committed by **confused**]{.underline},
**[selfish]{.underline}**, **[messy players]{.underline}**. With this [I
mean grassroots interventions that **do not take the
current**]{.underline} (Internet or IT infrastructure) [**stack as a
given** and **turn the Will to Totality**]{.underline} of the
engineering class and their financial backers **[against
itself]{.underline}**. In comparison with the hacktivism and (tactical)
media activism, [stacktivism]{.underline} is indeed Hegelian in scope
(Understanding Totality). It is confronting "das Ganze" and can be
considered counter regressive as it takes into account the real-existing
totality of today's interrelated tech-architectures as opposed to the
shrinking paranoid world of the online self that is in constant danger
of collapse under the weight of its own self-image, surveillance,
precarity and depression.

Niels ten Oever, Amsterdam-based Internet governance researcher and
activist [emphasises the importance of **linking contexts** and
**levels**]{.underline}:

"The stack never was and never will be. The stack always was an
abstraction, a story that was told to keep people working in an isolated
manner, ensuring engineers stuck to their own layer. As long as you
worked within your own parameters and delivered what the layer above and
below you expected of you, you would not get into trouble.
[Stacktivism]{.underline}, on the other hand, [works **across** the
stack]{.underline}: [it is a **cross-stack collaboration**]{.underline},
[an attempt to **realign** and **redesign** the interfaces]{.underline}.
[Looking for interconnections and associations that **cannot be drawn
from above**]{.underline}, [that **defy standardization**]{.underline}.
Interconnections that escape abstractions and stereotypes. [They are
established through **dynamic** and **unpredictable
handshakes**]{.underline}: questions, answers, and
re(-)cognition"\[13\].

Stacktivism is ambivalent and struggles with totality, the global scale
and the planetary whatever. [Think **big**]{.underline}, [but act in
**small steps**]{.underline}, that's the motto. We Are Infrastructure.
Stacktivism fights against the comfort of ignorance and tries hard to
overcome the designed lure to drift off, hovering above it all in a
subconscious fashion. While defining what stackitivism could become, it
is good to keep mind that [we're free to use]{.underline} Bratton's [The
Stack as a **theory toolbox** and not interpret it as a **hermetic
belief system**]{.underline}. [Designs can **intermingle**]{.underline}.
In line with Bratton, [stackivism claims to **understand** and **oversee
all levels**]{.underline}, from the politics of code, algorithms and AI
to the behavioural science manipulation of moods, interface design
choices and is alert to 5G electronic smog, phishing emails, fake news
and the other sleazy suggestions of your "friends". How about your bot
sensibility? [This hyperawareness comes at a **high
price**]{.underline}. **[Not everyone is a stacktivist ☹]{.underline}**

[Traditionally]{.underline}, [**direct action** has been put in
**opposition** to the **talk fest**]{.underline}. [When we
**act**]{.underline}, [we **stop talking** and **start
doing**]{.underline}. In the context of hacktivism this means that we no
longer consume but start to code in order to be able to hack into
computer systems [in order to make **real**]{.underline}, [**tangible
changes** in society]{.underline}. [Like **Robin Hood**]{.underline},
[let's define what **stackivism-for-good** could look like]{.underline}.
[How do we build **rhizomatic links** between global
governance]{.underline}, [protocol design]{.underline}, [the
ethics-without-consequences industry]{.underline}, [code writing and
investigative hacking?]{.underline} [Who will be in charge of
**subversive foresight**?]{.underline} [Can we **dream aloud
together**?]{.underline} How can delegate trust to our think tanks that
work in the public interest?

Stacktivism is a sovereign attitude in that it is not begging for a
correct form of representation and could be considered post-democratic
and post-identity, yet remains always all-too-human. Inside Douglas
Rushkoff's Team Human [stacktivists take up the task of **creating
missing links**]{.underline}: [they are the]{.underline} meme sharers,
**[idea connectors]{.underline}**, intercultural fellow travellers,
**[poly-disciplinary networkers]{.underline}**. The social creation of
new protocols remains an act of common decision. We are fighting at the
conceptual forefront of tech. Nobody needs to give us permission. Unlike
the tactical media interventions of the 1990s, stacktivism is -- by
definition-- abstract and conceptual in nature, knowing that code is
power and power is code. How to dismantle invisible power? Do we fight
abstractions with abstractions, design with counter-designs?

According to Internet and civil society researcher Corinne Cath [we
could see stacktivism as a]{.underline} "[**playful human evolution**
of]{.underline} Bratton's concept of [The Stack]{.underline}. [It
**critiques** its modular conception of world into **discrete
layers**]{.underline}. [To **remedy** this flattening]{.underline}, [it
calls for the inclusion of the **inherent messiness** of the
Internet]{.underline}: the entangled basement wires, packets lost in
translation, rugged governance cultures and the idiosyncratic usages of
the humans who rely on it to function flawlessly"\[14\]. Francesca
Musiani (CNRS, Paris) found the lessons of decentralisation telling:

"[Decentralization often becomes]{.underline} a technical, political,
economic and social aim in and of itself, reaching outside the 'hacker'
circles of the early p2p systems. However, this has had side effects.
Decentralization has become [an objective **in** and **of
itself**]{.underline}, [with **little understanding of intent** or
**assessment of actual effects**]{.underline}. I love Phil Agre\'s 2003
observation in this respect when he said: '[Architecture is
politics]{.underline}, [but should not be understood as a **substitute**
for politics]{.underline}'. [Decentralized protocols are **too readily
assumed**]{.underline}, because of their technical qualities, [to bring
about **decentralized**]{.underline} political, social and economic
**[outcomes]{.underline}**. [A **more fine-tuned appreciation** of the
social dimensions of the stack is likely to improve things]{.underline}
in this regard"\[15\].

Media historicism (aka archaeology) has so far failed to develop
critical concepts to understand the current situation, also known as
platform capitalism. There is more to the Internet than the politics of
the senses. Notation systems and perception are so 20th century. [What
matters now is]{.underline} who owns the Internet in terms of data
centres, cables and PR; and this is [**first** and **foremost** a
question of **material analysis**]{.underline}. A comparison with the
Roman road system, as described in Innis's Empire and Communications is
more relevant here\[16\]. Let's, for instance, investigate the relation
between the modernist stack and the fuzzy post-modern cloud buzzword.

How does Bratton's design relate to recent proposals by stacktivists
Francesca Bria and Evgeny Morozov for a European move towards "data
sovereignty"? It's too easy to unmask Bratton as a Californian
techno-solutionist. How much is gained by planting this (now effectively
empty) label on him? To determine, [to think technologically remains an
**utmost urgency** and it is precisely the]{.underline}
"**[stacking]{.underline}**" [of issues]{.underline}, [factors and
contexts that will **bring us further** into the constitutive force of
technical systems]{.underline}. **[The spectacle of clashing characters
should not distract us]{.underline}** (in fact, [the **silo
phantom**]{.underline}, [the silence and separation is]{.underline},
oddly, [our **main problem**]{.underline}, [in this hyperconnected
world]{.underline}).

### AT: Academy Bad

#### The aff's [cooperative re-imagination]{.underline} of communication and value can [redefine the subjectivity of society]{.underline}. The academy is key---if we win a link, it proves that we've identified a [crack in the system]{.underline} from which new relationalities can emerge.

**Hall, 20**---Professor of Education and Technology, De Montfort
University (Richard, "Platform Discontent against the University," *The
digital age and its discontents: Critical reflections in education*,
Chapter 7, 130-132, dml)

[The proletarianization of the University is predicated
upon]{.underline} atomized competition, which utilizes new forces of
production to reshape relations between people, in order to extract
value. A critical element of this is **[enforced
separation]{.underline}** between individuals, and the ability for
individual agency to be repurposed by structural requirements.
[However]{.underline}, in order [to extract maximum value]{.underline},
[capital requires individuals]{.underline} to work in concert, or [to
**collaborate**]{.underline} as producers, distributors and consumers.
[This gives opportunities for **cooperative
re-imagination**]{.underline}. For Marx (1866), the cooperative movement
was a transformational force where it understood its relationship to
labour as the point of social production. Thus, he argued that producer
cooperatives, as opposed to consumer cooperatives, are a manifestation
of class antagonism that can point towards 'the republican and
beneficent system of the association of free and equal producers'
(ibid., emphasis in the original). This analysis of cooperation rests on
forms of self-mediation by human beings of their material activities in
society. In an idealized cooperative state, [activities are **no longer
piecemeal** or **solitary**]{.underline}, [or governed by
capital]{.underline}; rather, [they are governed by **alternative
networks** of solidarity and purpose]{.underline}: 'This is not possible
without the community. Only within the community has each individual the
means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; hence personal freedom
becomes possible only within the community' (Marx & Engels 1998: 86).

A focus on the communal and associational characteristics of cooperation
is critical to Marx's praxis, because in them he sees the individual
developing the capabilities of their species (Marx 2004). As a result,
[a **refocusing** upon cooperative values and principles]{.underline},
grounded in the conceptual framework of the self-in-association, [acts
as a moment of **refusal** of alienated socialization]{.underline}, in
which the producers of society are estranged from both the means and
conditions of production of that society. However, discontent at the
present state of things does not coalesce into a single,
counter-hegemonic position, predicated upon a unified collection of
alternative governing principles for life. [It]{.underline} therefore
[becomes **important** to think about **alternative forms** of knowledge
production and an integration with alternative conceptions of
**mutuality**]{.underline}, [**solidarity** and
**cooperation**]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} those emerging [from
indigenous or marginalized communities]{.underline}.

Indigenous methodologies or modes of being help both to develop a fresh
focus on knowledge and to reframe the idea of movement towards a more
humane social production as a liminal process, engaging the body,
emotions and cognition (Tuhiwai Smith, Tuck & Yang 2018). In this
sensuous, epistemic opening, knowledge is rooted in people, place,
philosophy, values, communities, axiologies and cosmologies, which
generate 'relational accountability' (Wilson 2008: 77). Such
accountability is mutual, respectful and dignified, and acts as a
beginning for refusing the domination of knowledge from the global North
imposed as progressive and rooted in an ideological, evidence-based
epistemological standard. Here, [cooperative techniques for social
reproduction might enable forms of **relational
accountability**]{.underline} between peoples and places. Moreover, in
this process, [they offer the possibility of **liberating material
forces**]{.underline}, [including technology]{.underline}, [and
connecting them to alternative conceptions of the world]{.underline}, in
order [to **widen autonomy** and **freedom**]{.underline}.

For Marx (1866; 1970) [a cooperative revolution in the governance of
technology forms a **crucial strand** in changing the general conditions
of social production]{.underline}, [because it **redefines the
subjectivity of society** towards humanity and **away** from the
commodity and the valorization of capital]{.underline}. If we are to do
this, then [a **shared**]{.underline}, [**associational expression** of
individual lives is **required**]{.underline}, in order [to realize the
**essence** of what it means to be human]{.underline}. Marx's idea was
that [the expression of my life and those of my peers are **immanent**
to each other]{.underline}, [and should be mediated **directly** rather
than through the **market**]{.underline}, private property, the division
of labour and commodity exchange. [This requires an **alternative
conception** of how to integrate the forces of production into our
communal being]{.underline}, [and a **liberatory conception** of how
those forces are **subordinate** to our essence and our social
relations]{.underline} (Bookchin 2005). Beautifully, Marx (1844) argues
that [through such practices]{.underline} '[our products would be like
**so many mirrors**]{.underline}, [out of which our essence
**shone**]{.underline}' [as a]{.underline} '**[free
expression]{.underline}**' [of our lives]{.underline}.

[At issue is how to find **cracks** in the system of
capital]{.underline}, [into which technologies for
**alternative**]{.underline}, [**liberatory conceptions** of society can
be **inserted**]{.underline}. Dunayevskaya (1958) has argued that these
need to be situated inside organizations that are beyond
value-production, or they risk degenerating under competition. As a
result, a re-imagination of the University has to engage with more than
the cooperative possibilities of the collective ecosystems currently
structured to reproduce value. [A re-imagination of the potential for
forces of production to **enable social connection** and **knowledge
sharing**]{.underline}, and to liberate time for autonomous activity
rather than the imposition of commodity production, comes up against
structural contradictions. Thus, a re-imagination of technology as a
means for liberating knowledge for a new society [demands]{.underline} a
new material literacy as [a **radical**]{.underline}, **[pedagogical
project]{.underline}** at the level of society.

This is a transitional project [that critiques the place of technology
as it is **currently instantiated** inside the University]{.underline}.
[It critiques the relationship of the digital University]{.underline},
[and its techniques of governance]{.underline}, to knowledge production
and the generation of social wealth. It also critiques these
relationships and techniques [in terms of their ability to **enable
humanity** to engage with **global economic** and **environmental
crises**]{.underline}. [It critiques the **limitations** in our
collective ability to **produce knowledge** inside the University to
engage with these crises]{.underline}, in part [through the separation
of **polity** and **economy**]{.underline}, [such that the latter
**dominates** the former]{.underline}. It critiques these limitations as
they are reproduced inside organizations conditioned by the State to
generate value through exploitation and expropriation. In this way, [it
moves **beyond** the fetishization of technologies and
techniques]{.underline}, including the ways in which these are
reproduced and enclosed inside institutions like universities (see
Ampuja, Chapter 2, in this volume). [The potential for relational
accountability and]{.underline} the [recomposition]{.underline} of
peoples, places and technologies [offer an **alternative set of
possibilities** for intellectual work beyond the capitalized
University]{.underline}.

### AT: Afropessimism

#### The digitization of the carceral state [disproves]{.underline} the historical continuity of anti-Black oppression---it takes [different forms]{.underline}.

**Jefferson, 20**---associate professor of geography and geographic
information science and O'Connell Scholar in the College of Liberal Arts
and Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Brian,
"Introduction: NextGen Nightmare," *Digitize and Punish: Racial
Criminalization in the Digital Age*, Introduction, pg 13-16, dml)

A point of emphasis in the book is that [carceral power is **silently
spreading** through infrastructures]{.underline} of cellular towers,
datacenters, fiber-optic cables, smart sensors, and video cameras.
Carceral functionality is becoming a key attribute of the smart city.
This is not meant to say that the prison-industrial complex is being
wholly supplanted or that it is bound to disintegrate. Even though
incarceration rates have reached their lowest points in decades, [the
history of carceral management is **not** one of a **linear
development**. **Nor** is it a history of a **changeless institution**.
Carceral space has manifested in the form of **extraordinary rendition
sites**, **immigrant detention centers**, and **internment
camps**]{.underline}. This book traces [an **emergent form** of carceral
space that is characterized by **machines**]{.underline} that traverse
human anatomy, public housing facilities, public schools, transportation
systems, telecommunications systems, and street networks in U.S. cities.
The book also emphasizes that the deeper telecommunications and IT firms
entrench themselves in crime control policy, the more likely it is for
these infrastructures to continue to expand.

[The **extension** of carceral management through the]{.underline}
Internet of Things (**[IoT]{.underline}**), or networks of devices that
communicate with each other, [is]{.underline} greatly [influenced by the
movement of **capital**]{.underline}.42 On one hand, the carceral
state's circumscription of black and latinx communities was partly
catalyzed by the flight of industry from cities, which rendered entire
groups deskilled and unemployable. Decades of revelatory research
demonstrates how cities turned to mass criminalization to manage the
enormous economic, political, social, and medical problems arising from
deindustrialization.43 On the other hand, in addition to outbound
industrial capital, [the carceral state's **digital
architecture**]{.underline} owes its existence to inbound information
capital. The infrastructure sector has emerged as one of the most
important sectors in finance, knowledge, and technology industries.44 IT
companies have insinuated themselves in seemingly all facets of urban
life, including government agencies, private businesses, social
networks, transportation systems, workplaces, and infrastructure. These
companies have also nestled their way into criminal justice
administration, which [is **reshaping geographies** of carceral
governance]{.underline}.

A central argument in this book is that [the criminal justice system's
smart infrastructure is creating **new geometries** of carceral space.
On one hand, carceral space is **incredibly centralized**. Extraordinary
rendition sites, detention centers, jails, and prisons]{.underline},
which are designed to monitor, discipline, governmentalize, punish, and
sometimes execute or torture those caught within their grasp, [are a few
examples]{.underline}. IT firms have penetrated these spaces. For
instance, technology corporations sell geographic information systems to
help custodial authorities organize cell arrangements according to
demographic categories, predict inmate movements and behaviors, and
identify potential escape routes (see chapter 2). [Yet, on the other
hand, carceral space is **incredibly decentralized**. Carceral
geographers highlight the **elaborate logistics** required to shuttle
humans, information, and resources across prison facilities and entire
landscapes]{.underline}.45 Architects have characterized rural prison
facilities as urban exostructures, as they provide relief to the city's
overburdened criminal justice apparatus.46 [Technology firms
have]{.underline} also [**infiltrated** this decentralized dimension of
carceral management. Wireless networks]{.underline} of smart cameras,
phones, sensors, and tablets [**extend the reach** of the carceral
system]{.underline}. At the scale of the city, smart cameras and
environmental sensors send alerts to patrol vehicles dispersed
throughout street networks. On regional scales, real-time crime centers
receive data and transmit them throughout states and, increasingly,
between them. Owing to their portability, criminal justice technologies
also circulate on international scales. Today there exists a global
market for public security technology that traverses capitalist,
communist, and socialist nations. On yet a grander scale, electronic
forms of monitoring probationers depend on Global Positioning System
satellites, which extend the reach of carceral technology all the way
into low Earth orbit.

[**Taking the carceral state apart** and **making it less recognizable**
through the lens of smart infrastructure helps **short-circuit
illusions** that it is **neatly bounded** in terms of geography and
functionality. While the **illusion of a monolithic carceral Leviathan**
echoes modern theories of the state that never seem to fade away,
carceral statecraft is an **open**, **dynamic**, and **variegated
sociotechnical process** of quarantining human beings]{.underline}. As
such, [our **understanding** of carceral state power]{.underline},
Katherine Beckett and Naomi Murakawa observe, "[must be as
**capacious**, **complex**, and **adaptive** as the **policies** and
**institutions involved** in it]{.underline}."47 The present study
insists that analysis of this power's sociotechnical substrate is also
necessary to understand carceral conditions in the twenty-first century.

DESIGN OF THE BOOK

Digitize and Punish retells the history of mass criminalization by
[focusing on]{.underline} technology corporations and technology
bureaus. The book's objects of analysis are not criminalized communities
but rather the computer programmers, corporate-bureaucratic
intellectuals, state officials, and technologists who update [the
**tools** that criminalize]{.underline} them. It [tells **untold
stories** of the **contingencies**, **failed projects**, **unintended
consequences**, and **technical breakthroughs** involved in constructing
the digitized carceral state]{.underline}. It illustrates how [these
efforts have simultaneously **augmented** the carceral state and
**created new avenues of subverting it**]{.underline}.

This project employs an intersectional approach to understand the nexus
of carceral power, racism, and IT capital.48 The perspective was notably
captured by [the **Combahee River Collective** and **Kimberlé Williams
Crenshaw**]{.underline}, who [demonstrated the **inadequacies** of
understanding social hierarchy through **one measure**, or **axis of
division**]{.underline}.49 As such, [**structural analysis** of the
relations between **racial difference**, **technological development**,
and **political economic mutation is necessary** to understand the
relevant factors in racial criminalization in the digital age. The
question is **not** if racial criminalization behaves in a **structural
manner** but rather how it **maintains**]{.underline}, if not increases,
[**its structural integrity** from generation to
generation]{.underline}. This book therefore seeks to explain how
information capital exploited the surge of racial criminalization near
the end of the last century and, at the same time, how racial
criminalization was exploited by the rise of information technology.

#### The aff is an internal link turn and the perm solves. Embracing both black use of technology as well as blackness as technology creates moments of sociality within ontological structures of fungible commodification\-\--that places blackness, in this sense, as paraontological with respect to Wilderson

**Brock, 20** - André Brock Jr., PhD, Associate Professor in the School
of Literature, Media & Communication at the Georgia Institute of
Technology; 2020("Making a Way out of No Way Black Cyberculture and the
Black Technocultural Matrix," in *Distributed Blackness African American
Cybercultures*, NYU Press, 2020, Accessed Online via Michigan Libraries,
bam)

Throughout this book, I have framed Black online identity and Black
digital practice as Black cyberculture, an awkwardly named construct
incorporating cyberspace (itself a dated term) and technoculture. As
mentioned earlier, technoculture can be understood as the relations
between, and politics of, culture and technology. Dinerstein (2006)
argues that "technology is the American mythos" (p. 570). When defined
this way, however, technoculture often tricks upon the racial identity
of whiteness, and white racial ideology and technological beliefs become
the norm. That obviously won't do! [Black technology users are not white
(even if they are Western), so it becomes necessary to interrogate how
Black people make sense of their existence as users and as subjects
within advanced technological artifacts, services, and
platforms]{.underline}. This final chapter is that catechism, [firmly
placing Black folk at the center of information and communication
technology use]{.underline}. I offer this interrogation not as a summary
of the previous chapters but as a provocation for those who are
interested [in centering Blackness as digital practice]{.underline}.

[[Reorienting technoculture to incorporate Blackness invites]{.mark} an
[inquiry into]{.mark} the possibilities of [Blackness as
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}---**[[not Black
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([been there, done that]{.underline})
**[[but Blackness as technology]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[in the same
way that Blackness often stands in for the best of American
entertainment and culture]{.underline}. I am not arguing for minstrelsy
and blackface here, to be clear, even though those representations of
Blackness are as American as apple pie. Nor am I suggesting that
Blackness is a nonserious use of technology; indeed, **[[technology use
for Blacks]{.mark} often [occurs from the margins of society]{.mark},
[where survival, joy, and resistance intertwine uncomfortably]{.mark} in
the everyday]{.underline}**. Chun (2013) contends that
race-as-technology "posits a comparative equality or
substitutability---but not identity---between the two" (p. 8). Chun goes
on to probe how [whiteness incorporates science and technology to build
technologies and institutions of race]{.underline}---a helpful
formulation for antiblackness and technology but not as necessary here.
Instead, I would like to begin from the introduction's discussion of
"technology as text" [to build out from the possibilities of Black
thought into a concept of Black technoculture]{.underline}. From there,
I will discuss Afrofuturism as an analytic for Black technology use and
time and Black technoculture. Finally, I close with a foray into a
libidinal framework of Black technoculture.

Technologies as Cultural Texts

My argument here centers on the digital's networked and distributive
capacity for banal, everyday Black information and computer technology
(ICT) practices, but others have argued similarly for artistic and
technical artifacts (Fouché, 2006; Ebo, 1998; McGahan, 2013; Weheliye,
2002). "Technology as text" has multiple postulations for distributed
Blackness and for Black technoculture:

• code (interface and practices)

• the digitally distributed content generated by and mediated by that
code

• signifyin' and other cultural discourses of Black digital
practitioners

The first two are instrumental and organizational; think of the
possibilities for art and discourse that were introduced by Grandmaster
Flash's innovative technique of scratching records as part of a musical
performance. The last marks the generative relationship between the
first two, revivifying the noncommunicability of Blackness into a
mediation for the production of Black life and thought. From this
perspective, code, digital discourse, and language-as-culture can (and
do) constitute racial identity. Adding technological mediations of
discourse (Herring, 2001) allows one to examine computer-mediated
communication and digital practice as racial identity as well.

[[It is vital]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[to not
incorporate]{.mark} the digital's technocultural
[alienation]{.mark}]{.underline} (drawing on whiteness's Manichaean
separation of mind and body; Dyer, 1997) [[into]{.underline}]{.mark} my
formulation of [[online Blackness]{.underline}]{.mark}. I wrote the
previous sentence long before I read [[Wilderson]{.underline}]{.mark}
(2010), but his words [[advance my claim]{.underline}]{.mark}: "[[As
a]{.mark}n accumulated and [fungible object]{.mark}, rather than an
exploited and alienated subject, [the Black is openly vulnerable
to]{.mark} the whims of the world and so is his or her [cultural
'production]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}" (p. 56). Here **[Wilderson
states that [because Black folk have no legible stature in the
West]{.mark} as political agents, [they have no inalienable
rights]{.mark} to Black cultural production]{.underline}**. [[Thus
Blackness]{.mark} (in online spaces]{.underline} and elsewhere) **[[is
immediately captured by Western culture]{.underline}]{.mark}**, leaving
little possibility for emancipation from that framework[. I
agree]{.underline}: **[[while I recognize]{.mark} possibilities for
[emancipation through radical and decolonizing digital
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[my pressing concern]{.mark} for
Black technoculture [is to]{.mark} make [manifest]{.mark} **the
[vitality and joy of Black uses of ICTs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
**[[While these libidinal impulses may become commodified or surveilled,
they are paraontological]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[that is, the embodied
cognition they express preexists the platforms on which they are
published, visible, and deemed appropriate for consumption]{.underline}.
[The digital mediates culture]{.underline}---[in this case
Blackness]{.underline}, but otherwise typically white Western---**[[in
ways that allow for sociality despite
commodification]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The next section reviews other
researchers' takes on Black technological practice, which I then extend
to specifically examine digital practice.

### AT: Capitalism

#### Collective resubjectivization generates [material liberation]{.underline}.

**Hall, 20**---Professor of Education and Technology, De Montfort
University (Richard, "Platform Discontent against the University," *The
digital age and its discontents: Critical reflections in education*,
Chapter 7, 130-132, dml)

[The proletarianization of the University is predicated
upon]{.underline} atomized competition, which utilizes new forces of
production to reshape relations between people, in order to extract
value. A critical element of this is **[enforced
separation]{.underline}** between individuals, and the ability for
individual agency to be repurposed by structural requirements.
[However]{.underline}, in order [to extract maximum value]{.underline},
[capital requires individuals]{.underline} to work in concert, or [to
**collaborate**]{.underline} as producers, distributors and consumers.
[This gives opportunities for **cooperative
re-imagination**]{.underline}. For Marx (1866), the cooperative movement
was a transformational force where it understood its relationship to
labour as the point of social production. Thus, he argued that producer
cooperatives, as opposed to consumer cooperatives, are a manifestation
of class antagonism that can point towards 'the republican and
beneficent system of the association of free and equal producers'
(ibid., emphasis in the original). This analysis of cooperation rests on
forms of self-mediation by human beings of their material activities in
society. In an idealized cooperative state, [activities are **no longer
piecemeal** or **solitary**]{.underline}, [or governed by
capital]{.underline}; rather, [they are governed by **alternative
networks** of solidarity and purpose]{.underline}: 'This is not possible
without the community. Only within the community has each individual the
means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; hence personal freedom
becomes possible only within the community' (Marx & Engels 1998: 86).

A focus on the communal and associational characteristics of cooperation
is critical to Marx's praxis, because in them he sees the individual
developing the capabilities of their species (Marx 2004). As a result,
[a **refocusing** upon cooperative values and principles]{.underline},
grounded in the conceptual framework of the self-in-association, [acts
as a moment of **refusal** of alienated socialization]{.underline}, in
which the producers of society are estranged from both the means and
conditions of production of that society. However, discontent at the
present state of things does not coalesce into a single,
counter-hegemonic position, predicated upon a unified collection of
alternative governing principles for life. [It]{.underline} therefore
[becomes **important** to think about **alternative forms** of knowledge
production and an integration with alternative conceptions of
**mutuality**]{.underline}, [**solidarity** and
**cooperation**]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} those emerging [from
indigenous or marginalized communities]{.underline}.

Indigenous methodologies or modes of being help both to develop a fresh
focus on knowledge and to reframe the idea of movement towards a more
humane social production as a liminal process, engaging the body,
emotions and cognition (Tuhiwai Smith, Tuck & Yang 2018). In this
sensuous, epistemic opening, knowledge is rooted in people, place,
philosophy, values, communities, axiologies and cosmologies, which
generate 'relational accountability' (Wilson 2008: 77). Such
accountability is mutual, respectful and dignified, and acts as a
beginning for refusing the domination of knowledge from the global North
imposed as progressive and rooted in an ideological, evidence-based
epistemological standard. Here, [cooperative techniques for social
reproduction might enable forms of **relational
accountability**]{.underline} between peoples and places. Moreover, in
this process, [they offer the possibility of **liberating material
forces**]{.underline}, [including technology]{.underline}, [and
connecting them to alternative conceptions of the world]{.underline}, in
order [to **widen autonomy** and **freedom**]{.underline}.

For Marx (1866; 1970) [a cooperative revolution in the governance of
technology forms a **crucial strand** in changing the general conditions
of social production]{.underline}, [because it **redefines the
subjectivity of society** towards humanity and **away** from the
commodity and the valorization of capital]{.underline}. If we are to do
this, then [a **shared**]{.underline}, [**associational expression** of
individual lives is **required**]{.underline}, in order [to realize the
**essence** of what it means to be human]{.underline}. Marx's idea was
that [the expression of my life and those of my peers are **immanent**
to each other]{.underline}, [and should be mediated **directly** rather
than through the **market**]{.underline}, private property, the division
of labour and commodity exchange. [This requires an **alternative
conception** of how to integrate the forces of production into our
communal being]{.underline}, [and a **liberatory conception** of how
those forces are **subordinate** to our essence and our social
relations]{.underline} (Bookchin 2005). Beautifully, Marx (1844) argues
that [through such practices]{.underline} '[our products would be like
**so many mirrors**]{.underline}, [out of which our essence
**shone**]{.underline}' [as a]{.underline} '**[free
expression]{.underline}**' [of our lives]{.underline}.

[At issue is how to find **cracks** in the system of
capital]{.underline}, [into which technologies for
**alternative**]{.underline}, [**liberatory conceptions** of society can
be **inserted**]{.underline}. Dunayevskaya (1958) has argued that these
need to be situated inside organizations that are beyond
value-production, or they risk degenerating under competition. As a
result, a re-imagination of the University has to engage with more than
the cooperative possibilities of the collective ecosystems currently
structured to reproduce value. [A re-imagination of the potential for
forces of production to **enable social connection** and **knowledge
sharing**]{.underline}, and to liberate time for autonomous activity
rather than the imposition of commodity production, comes up against
structural contradictions. Thus, a re-imagination of technology as a
means for liberating knowledge for a new society [demands]{.underline} a
new material literacy as [a **radical**]{.underline}, **[pedagogical
project]{.underline}** at the level of society.

This is a transitional project [that critiques the place of technology
as it is **currently instantiated** inside the University]{.underline}.
[It critiques the relationship of the digital University]{.underline},
[and its techniques of governance]{.underline}, to knowledge production
and the generation of social wealth. It also critiques these
relationships and techniques [in terms of their ability to **enable
humanity** to engage with **global economic** and **environmental
crises**]{.underline}. [It critiques the **limitations** in our
collective ability to **produce knowledge** inside the University to
engage with these crises]{.underline}, in part [through the separation
of **polity** and **economy**]{.underline}, [such that the latter
**dominates** the former]{.underline}. It critiques these limitations as
they are reproduced inside organizations conditioned by the State to
generate value through exploitation and expropriation. In this way, [it
moves **beyond** the fetishization of technologies and
techniques]{.underline}, including the ways in which these are
reproduced and enclosed inside institutions like universities (see
Ampuja, Chapter 2, in this volume). [The potential for relational
accountability and]{.underline} the [recomposition]{.underline} of
peoples, places and technologies [offer an **alternative set of
possibilities** for intellectual work beyond the capitalized
University]{.underline}.

#### [Mastery DA]{.underline}: The notion of a [universal dialectic]{.underline} is a neurotic projection of the will to mastery\-\--it [transforms the alt]{.underline} into genocidal party politics\-\--only the affirmative's rejection of static linearity solves 

**Berardi 15** (Franco Berardi, like Lenin but not depressed, *AND:
Phenomenology of the End*, p. 90-95)

[[Desire for the Absolute is visible in the]{.mark} historical sphere as
a will of total palingenesis]{.underline}, [[purification of the social
community]{.mark} from the traces of the past]{.underline}. [[The
reference]{.mark} to purity [is transparent in the Russian]{.mark}
conception of Revolution]{.underline}, particularly in the [[Leninist
persuasion]{.underline}]{.mark} that the revolutionary political party
is the "incarnation" of the pure idea coming down from German
Philosophy, and must be embodied by a small organization of professional
bearers of the Revolutionary Truth. The Russian exacerbation of the role
of pure subjectivity entered the scene of the world history in 1917.
[The]{.underline} [Soviet Revolution]{.underline}---that Lenin managed
to unleash against the will of many prominent leaders of the Russian
socialist movement, [provoked a catastrophic polarization in the
worldwide social conflict]{.underline}, [and forced the worker's
movement to identify with a totalitarian experiment, based on the
**authoritarian statalization of class struggle**]{.underline}. [[The
Russian revolution provoked an irreversible rupture and a]{.mark}
**permanent [laceration in the body of society]{.mark}** whose effects
persisted worldwide]{.underline} all along the century. [[Lenin forced
the]{.mark} workers of the world to defend the Socialist State of the
Soviets, and to enter [a process of permanent war]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This war lasted until 1989, but [since the beginning the worker class
was doomed to unavoidable defeat]{.underline}. [The messianic
utopianism]{.underline}, widespread in the Russian society of the
nineteenth century [merged with the hyper-voluntaristic project of the
Bolsheviks]{.underline}, so the history of Communist revolution began as
a tragedy in the context of the immolation culture, and since the
beginning was destined to end as a tragedy. [[The violence]{.mark} and
the authoritarianism [that]{.mark} [the Leninist experiment
unleashed]{.mark} in the country [and exported]{.mark} worldwide
brutally changing the prospects of the international movement for
worker's emancipation]{.underline}, were inscribed in the Russian
history of the previous centuries, [and [**still prevail in the Russian
political life**,]{.mark} after the end of the Soviet
dictatorship]{.underline}. Leninist communism may have ruined Russia,
but certainly [Russia has (forever?) ruined Communism as a possible
alternative to Capitalism]{.underline}, [as the Russian subjectivism and
**cult of purity** have dragged the international movement of the
workers into a vision of permanent military mobilization]{.underline}
that was not part of the Marxian imprinting. [The spontaneous goal of
the workers movement is to expand the space of autonomy from capitalist
exploitation]{.underline}. [The idea that the movement is taken in a
dialectical contradiction is an effect of the Hegelian interpretation of
the social process]{.underline}: this idea becomes historical reality
when the Russian palingenetic cult of pureness melts with the Hegelian
tradition. [The fusion of Marxism and Leninism is the origin of the
workers defeat]{.underline}, in my opinion. [Lenin brings into the
worker's political discourse an element of subjectivism and of purity
that did not belong to the experience of autonomous social
movements]{.underline}. The workers movement was aimed to emancipate
spaces of life and of the territory from the capitalist domination, but
[[the Leninist breakthrough transformed the movement into a project of
absolute separation]{.mark} from the existing world, of radical
demolition and of palingenetic purification]{.underline}. In the first
part of the book, Lenin confirms Lassalle's argument: the purification
(epuration, cleansing) is strengthening the party. [[This idea of
ideological cleansing]{.underline}]{.mark} (epuration) [[is the main
thread]{.mark} of the history of the Soviet Communist
Party]{.underline}, particularly in the Stalin age. According to the
words of Lenin: "the worker class is only able to elaborate an economic
unionist consciousness, but is unable to understand the radical
opposition to the system." (Lenin, What has to be done?) [[This
impurity]{.mark} of the worker class has [to be overcome, so that
society can adapt to the purity of the communist
ideal]{.mark}]{.underline}. Only a party which is the bearer of the pure
Logos can be the bearer of the revolutionary project---not the
aggregation of impure social bodies. In her biographical essay on Lenin,
[the French historian]{.underline} of Georgian origins Hélène Carrère
d'Encausse [speaks of two major episodes of clinical depression in the
life of Lenin that are generally ignored by the hagiografic Leninist
tradition]{.underline}. [The book]{.underline} (Lenine, la Revolution et
le pouvoir, 1979) is interesting especially because it [is focusing on
the affective life of the communist leader]{.underline}: the importance
of the relation with the mother, the sister, and particularly of the
wife, Nadeezda Krupskaja, who took care of him in the periods of acute
psychic crisis. The book also speaks of Ines Armand, the lover who
disturbingly entered the life of Lenin, and was later removed,
neutralized, as a potential danger for the political integrity of the
leader. [Depression is the peculiar feature of the psychological
description of Lenin, and depressive crises are coinciding with the most
important political decisions of his life]{.underline}. The first major
crisis, according to Hélène Carrère d'Encausse, occurred in the year
1902, and coincided with the decision of founding the Communist party
and the draft of What has to be done? The second occurred in 1914, when
Lenin takes the decision of breaking with the Second International
before Zimmerwald Congress, and the Communist Schism at the European
scale. The third occurred in Spring 1917 and coincided with the decision
of launching the Soviet insurrection which actually took place in
October. [These decisions]{.underline}, [that]{.underline} marked the
emergence of the Communist identity, and [forced a voluntary
acceleration on the history of class struggle all over Europe and
worldwide]{.underline}, [can be linked in my opinion with the depressive
cycle of Lenin]{.underline}. [[When intelligence is depressive, only
will is the therapy that makes possible ignoring the
abyss]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The abyss is not removed, not resolved, not
avoided or overcome]{.underline}. [It is ignored, but still it is there,
and the decades following the Revolution have actually exposed its
persistence, so that the century sunk down into the abyss]{.underline}.
More than in the political meaning of the decisions of Lenin, here I'm
interested in the relation between Bolshevik voluntarism and the male
inability to deal with depression. By the political point of view, the
Bolshevik breach provoked a general precipitation of the confrontation
between workers and capital in the world: [[workers were pushed]{.mark}
everywhere [towards]{.mark} a [totalizing]{.mark} form of
[opposition]{.mark}, and actually towards civil war]{.underline}. The
social autonomy was obliged to choose between revolutionary terror and
capitulation. And [where the communist parties succeeded in seizing
political power, [this was turned into **violent dictatorship**]{.mark}
**and submission of social life**]{.underline}. This way [[the]{.mark}
Leninist [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} prepared the worldwide
catastrophe that at the end of the century has [[provoked the worst
possible defeat]{.mark} whose effects we'll be experiencing for
decades]{.underline}. [The project of a rebirth of the world beginning
with the palingenetic violence of the revolution is a mythology that has
no historical foundation]{.underline}. History has never known
abolition, palingenesis or rebirth. [[History is always about
stratification]{.mark}, negotiation, coevolution, autonomy or
dependence]{.underline}, identification or extraneousness. [Not about
abolition]{.underline}. **[[Leninism can be considered as an attempt to
deny depression]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [as an assertion of the purity
of will, [as a refusal to accept the finiteness of human
potency]{.mark}]{.underline}: male hysteria that was already at work in
the Dostoevsky's writings.

#### Marxist theorizations of change fail to account for the ontological nature of modern capitalism -- the aff's approach is the only way to create individual value in the world of utility 

**Magrini 11** (James, Professor at the College of DuPage, "Working to
Recover the Essence of Education for the Sake of Teaching and Teacher
Education: Towards a Phenomenological Understanding of the Forgotten,
Ontological Aspects of Learning" p. 4)NCF

It is evident that [there is a serious problem with educational
procedures]{.underline} emerging out of the "bureaucratic/rational
choice model" that is two-fold in nature, [a problem that is in fact
antibiotic, as in a vicious sense of codependence.
Instructors]{.underline} who [are increasingly alienated
from]{.underline} what might serve as legitimate, or [authentic,
curriculum]{.underline} for the preparation of
**[[teachers]{.mark}]{.underline}** entering the field **[[are slaves to
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** governed by pre-determined standards
of achievement. [[These institutions are]{.mark} then [filtering
ill-prepared]{.mark} (alienated) [teachers into a system that is
governed]{.mark} i]{.underline}n much the same way, namely, [[by
standards]{.mark} and **competencies [established by bureaucratic
agencies that are at a remove from authentic educational]{.mark}
purposes and [practices]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Teachers are thus
alienated in a duplicitous sense, both from the curriculum they are now
forced to teach and the students who cannot relate to what is being
taught. Bonnett (2001) echoes the sentiments expressed earlier when
stating that [[the current "predisposition to regard
outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark} of education as definable in advance of
the process of education[" [engenders a deterministic system]{.mark} of
education [that **obscures authentic subject-**hood and we lose sight of
the fact that humans]{.mark} [are "**individual centers of
consciousness**]{.mark} [**capable of relating to the world in ways that
have personal meaning**,]{.mark} for this is essential to human being
against some sort of mechanized and depersonalized being"]{.underline}
(p. 30). In short, there is a loss of ownership on the part of both
educator and student, but beyond this**[, [there is a loss of authentic
subject-hood]{.mark}]{.underline}**; ironically, by means of education,
we are losing sight of what it means to be truly human.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} alienation from the curriculum and
[[authentic subject-hood of which I speak **should not be conceived in
terms of Marxist theory, which tends to focus on ideology**]{.mark}
**and the critique of capitalism and its detrimental effects on schools.
[Rather, I conceive alienation and depersonalization in terms of]{.mark}
what**]{.underline} Heidegger (1979) calls [[the
oblivion]{.underline}]{.mark}, or forgetting[, of Being, which is
grounded in the failure to ask about "the truth of being itself" and
about "the way the essence of human being belongs to the truth of
Being"]{.underline} (p. 246). This condition, which pervades the world
of education, grows from the tradition in Western metaphysics and its
subsequent influence on the rise of science and technology. In short[,
**[education is moving us farther away from essential issues
of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[human dwelling]{.underline}]{.mark}** as
linked with our Being, **[[and the ontological aspects of our
existence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is now to the potential recovery of
this essential, forgotten ontological notion of authentic
Beingin-the-world as related to education that I turn.

#### Stacktivism [socializes]{.underline} technology and reshapes the [foundation]{.underline} of capitalist notions of value.

**Dragona 15**(Daphne, PhD from the Faculty of Communication & Media
Studies of the University of Athens, "From Community Networks to
Off-the-cloud toolkits: Art and DIY networking", CS)

Firstly, all [networks discussed follow a usercentered approach. The
human and non human elements that a network involves are balanced by
always allowing the users to have control of the nodes of the
network]{.underline}; setting them up, controlling them and sustaining
them. [In the era of algorithmic automation and control, its important
to remember]{.underline} what Munster and Lovink wrote, [that the rise
of networks should be made understood as an all too human
behaviour]{.underline} \[77\]. Whereas as Medosch says 'in ubiquitous
computing, [it is usually the devices which get smarter and the people
who remain stupid',]{.underline} in the cases of such initiatives a 'new
Internet of People', following here Nold and van Kranenburg, and can
emerge against the Internet of things \[78, 79\]. Secondly, the
[topologies of DIY networking are exposed and understood by a merging of
the social and the technological.]{.underline} As a user is always
behind a node and in control of a node, it is easier to realize the
edges and nodes, the architecture and potentiality of the network. [This
idea]{.underline} of "becoming the machine" that Pasquinelli mentioned
[can be understood as becoming the node and gaining control of the
network]{.underline}. Thirdly, [all infrastructures]{.underline} of
different scale are based on open software and hardware [leaving open to
the users the possibility for modifying]{.underline} and even
repurposing them for [their own needs;]{.underline} this way not only
the DIY but also the DIWO ethos is encouraged embracing the logic of
thinking, sharing, working together. This in a manifestation of what
Hardt and Negri have stated when they argued that "being with" is no
longer enough"; a "doing with" is necessary \[80\]. [Alternatives based
on collaboration and sociality are introduced to spread and teach people
how not only to modify and use infrastructures but also to make
decisions, possibly based on criteria which are qualitative and
humanistic]{.underline} \[81\]. [Staying out of the market of
centralized systems and platforms, a new system and theory of value is
embraced. Encouraging forms of exchange economy and providing tools and
knowledge freely and openly]{.underline}, [a significant effort is made
for social value to outbalance market value]{.underline}, [for sharing
networks to surpass zones of property]{.underline}. Fourthly, and in
continuation of the above arguments the infrastructures proposed can be
seen as part of the new 'Network Commons' as Armin Medosch puts it.
Although Medosch refers primarily to the community networks, this can
greatly stand for the wider family of offline sharing [networks as they
are systems in terms of infrastructure and content that are meant to be
constructed, possessed and managed by all. Through such platforms, users
are invited "to speak and think, to become informed and to
participate]{.underline}", as Stavrides has put it for the necessity of
the contemporary commons \[82\]. The making of the common in the case of
infrastructures is therefore a process based on potentialities, skills
and affects of the users and [this can be approached as meaningful acts
of commoning]{.underline}.

### AT: Ivory Tower

#### Stacks are as material as you can get.

**Mohorčich 17**(Jospeh, Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University, "POWER
PRAGMATISM", CS)

[A sensible plan for radical transformation,]{.underline} therefore,
[will start with a plan for taking care of basic human needs: an
alternative technology stack for keeping human beings alive so that they
don't die when the standard systems of feeding and caring for them fail
or are removed]{.underline}. Gupta argues that "you don't \[convert to a
new life-support stack\] by pulling the old one down. [You \[convert\]
by building a new one, prototyping it, bootstrapping it from the
resources of the old, proving that it works, and then pulling the
population across."]{.underline}403 As Bratton points out, [stacks are
"intrinsically modular]{.underline}," so each is "also a platform, and
an interface even, for the redesign and replacement of the Stack-we-have
with a Stack-we-want."[404 To think about radical transformation---up to
and including revolution---without thinking about infrastructure is to
neglect that engineering and politics are embedded in each
othe]{.underline}r. Because any plan for political transformation must
start with some kind of life-support plan, it makes sense to start
working on these types of plans and to bring this work explicitly into
the political-theory fold[. Working to diagram and assemble alternative
life-support stacks has the potential to convert cycles of radical
action from self-defeating to self-reinforcing]{.underline}. [As
activists and thinkers are increasingly existing stacks]{.underline},
and to not get enmeshed in questions about who's going to call in sick
to work or argue with Comcast this week[, they are able to think,
agitate, and act in a more engaged manner, which opens space for further
political-material-technical moves that strengthen alternative
stacks]{.underline}, which engenders further agitation and thought,
which restarts the cycle. For example, Bitcoin's role as a functional
component of an alternative financial stack (i[) demonstrates the
technical viability of]{.underline} blockchain-based [experiments to
create alternative stacks for education, personal identification, energy
markets, housing, carbon emission tracking, and so on]{.underline}, and
(ii) [pulls developers,]{.underline} users, and billions of dollars in
wealth [from existing financial stacks into alternative
ones,]{.underline} which creates the material, technical, and social
grist for further developments. To be sure, purchasing baby formula or
pizza with a blockchain currency is not itself a shatteringly radical
move, especially if the supply chains for what you have bought can still
be traced through to structures of degradation, exploitation, and
accumulation. This is why [building alternative stacks for the
production and transport of energy, food, heat, and information that
interleave with alternative financial structures like blockchain
currencies remains a critical and self-reinforcing task]{.underline}.406

### AT: Settler Colonialism

#### The development of [imperial technology]{.underline} explains the mechanisms of dispossession [better]{.underline}. 

**Harris, 4**---Department of Geography, University of British Columbia
(Cole, "How Did Colonialism Dispossess? Comments from an Edge of
Empire," Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 94:1,
165-182, dml)

[The emphasis on culture in studies of colonialism tends to **obscure**
other forms of colonial power while making it **impossible to
contextualize** the cultural argument and **assess its salience**.
Rather than focusing on]{.underline} texts, [**systems of
signification**, and **procedures of knowledge
generation**]{.underline}, as the colonial discourse literature is wont
to do, [a **fuller understanding** of colonial powers is achieved by
**explaining colonialism's basic geographical dispossessions** of the
colonized. In so doing, the issue of power is **not prejudged** and the
**particular roles** of different modes and theories of colonial power
come into focus]{.underline}. I explore these propositions by
considering the powers underlying the reserve (reservation) system in
British Columbia, a system that, by allocating a tiny fraction of the
land to native people and opening the rest for development, facilitated
the geographical reorganization of the province. My conclusions are
these: [the **initial ability** to dispossess rested **primarily on
physical power** and the **supporting infrastructure** of the
state]{.underline}; the momentum to dispossess derived from the interest
of capital in profit and of settlers in forging new livelihoods; the
legitimation of and moral justification for dispossession lay in a
cultural discourse that located civilization and savagery and identified
the land uses associated with each; and the management of dispossession
rested with a set of disciplinary technologies of which maps, numbers,
law, and the geography of resettlement itself were the most important.
Although **[no one body of theory explains colonial
power]{.underline}**, several theoretical perspectives yield crucial
insights. Key Words: colonialism, colonial discourse theory,
deterritorialization, colonial land policies, governmentality,
reservations, British Columbia.

[Influenced by]{.underline} Michel Foucault's analysis of the
relationships of power and knowledge (1972), by Edward Said's
examination of Orientalism (1978), by [**textual theory** harnessed to
**colonial discourse analysis**, and by many studies of the **values**
and **ideologies** enmeshed in particular colonial
encounters]{.underline}, most postcolonial [scholars now
identify]{.underline} culture and associated [**procedures of knowledge
generation** as the **dominant power relations** associated with
colonialism. Whereas]{.underline} Frantz **[Fanon]{.underline}** (1963)
[emphasized **violence**---the **power of the gun**]{.underline}---and
Marx, to the extent that he wrote on colonialism, the aggressive reach
of capital, [postcolonial research]{.underline} and writing [situates
the momentum of colonialism in the **culture** of imperialists and
colonists. A **central goal**]{.underline}, therefore, of colonial
discourse theory [is to identify the **assumptions** and
**representations** inherent in colonial culture---in the
**binary**]{.underline} of civilization/savagery, [in the **erasures of
Aboriginal knowledge of time** and **space**, in **assumptions about
race** and **gender**, in the **concept of the land as
empty**]{.underline} (terra nullius), [and so on---and
then]{.underline}, insofar as possible, [to **expose their contemporary
manifestations**. This]{.underline} work [has **focused much scholarly
energy**]{.underline} and has yielded important theoretical and
practical results, [but it is **less clear** that it has **revealed the
principal momentum** and **power relations** inherent in
colonialism]{.underline}.

Originating in literary and cultural studies, colonial discourse theory,
indeed postcolonial [scholarship]{.underline} generally, [privileges the
**investigation of imperial texts**, **enunciations**, and **systems of
signification**]{.underline}. In so doing, it exposes implicit modes of
seeing and of understanding that are held to infuse and validate
colonialism while imparting much of its momentum. If Said offered
broadly inclusive descriptions of colonial culture, and if others, more
recently, have emphasized the variety of colonial voices and the
importance of a local, contextual appreciation of different colonial
cultures (e.g., Thomas 1994), in either case, [culture is treated as a
**primary locus** of colonial power]{.underline}. Moreover, [as elements
of colonial culture are assumed to have outlived formal colonial
regimes, their **identification** becomes an **active political
project**]{.underline}---the decolonization of representation (Hall
2000, 5). [In itself, this is commendable enough, but if studies of
colonial culture are **not contextualized** among other forms of
colonial power, then it is **well nigh impossible to assess the
particular work** and the **relative salience** of colonial culture
itself]{.underline}. A study of travel writing, for example, may yield
an appreciation of the inflected seeing of travelers and of the
complicity of such seeing with colonial projects, while not beginning to
address the relative importance of travelers' seeing and writing in the
whole colonial enterprise. Given its focus, it cannot. At best, it can
yield a nuanced understanding of traveler perceptions and values, and
suggestive ideas about their relationships with colonialism.
Colonialism's complexity may be affirmed, so too, perhaps, the
discursive construction of reality comments tied more closely to theory
than to a situated knowledge of colonial practices and power relations.

In the hands of some of its most able practitioners, postcolonial
scholarship is a potent means of exploring the reworking
(''provincializing'') of European thought at and for the margins of
empire (Chakrabarty 2000, 16). However, [most postcolonial
scholarship]{.underline} is written out of British or American
universities and emanates from the heart of a recently superceded empire
or of a recently ascendant one that hesitates to acknowledge its own
imperial background. American postcolonial scholarship is not
preoccupied with America (Hulme 1995; Thomas 1994 172--73). In the
background of such scholarship are European theorists, particularly
Foucault, Derrida, and Gramsci; in the foreground, European colonial
thought and culture. In these circumstances, as many have pointed out,
it tends to be Eurocentric---or as the Australian anthropologist Patrick
Wolfe puts it, occidocentric (1999, 1). So positioned, it [is well
placed to comment on the **imperial mind** in its **large diversity**,
and even]{.underline}---especially in the hands of scholars like Homi
Bhabha and Dipesh Chakrabarty who grew up in former colonies---[on the
ways in which European thought has been **inflected** and **hybridized**
by its colonial encounters, but **not** on the **diverse**,
**on-the-ground workings** of colonialism in colonized spaces around the
world]{.underline}. A central claim of the distinguished Indian
subaltern historian, Ranajit Guha, is that if British historical writing
on the subcontinent reveals something of Britain and the Raj, it reveals
nothing of India (1997). Somewhat similar criticisms have been made of
much of [the]{.underline} postcolonial [literature]{.underline}: that it
(or parts of it) anticipates a radically restructured European
historiography, that it [allows for **nothing outside the (European)
discourse** of colonialism]{.underline}, that [it is **yet another
exercise in metatheory** and in **European universalism**]{.underline}
(e.g., Slemon 1994; McClintock 1994). As the literary theorist Benita
Parry puts it, the postcolonial emphasis on language and texts tends to
offer ''the World according to the Word'' (1997, 12)---and the word
tends to be European. But [unless it can be shown that colonialism is
**entirely constituted by European colonial culture** (a proposition for
which it is **hard to imagine any convincing evidence** unless the
concept of culture is **understood so broadly** that it **loses any
analytical value**), then studies of colonial discourse, written from
the center, must be a **very partial window** on the workings of
colonialism]{.underline}.

The discipline of geography has responded to postcolonial thought in a
variety of ways (Clayton 2003). Among others, studies of colonialism
itself have come into vogue, most of them written in Britain, a few from
the edges of empire. I am struck by how much the character of these
studies has been influenced by the locations of their authors. Consider,
for example, two recent books by historical geographers: Felix Driver's
Geography Militant: Cultures of Exploration and Empire (2000), and Frank
Tough's ''As Their Natural Resources Fail'': Native Peoples and the
Economic History of Northern Manitoba, 1870--1930 (1996). From opposite
perspectives, they treat a fairly similar period of British colonialism.
Driver analyzes the culture of exploration, particularly the sites and
nature of its production and consumption---as at the Royal Geographical
Society. His is a study of the ways in which the British imperial mind,
both popular and academic, processed explorers' information. Tough's
work is embedded in the materiality of a declining fur trade in the
northern Manitoba bush. It deals with forts and trade routes; with
economies and survival strategies as a twohundred-year-old system of
commercial capital vacated the region; and with native livelihoods found
in a precarious balance between what remained of a hunting, fishing, and
gathering economy and intermittent employment in uncertain industrial
resource economies. Each is an authentic study, yet they have little to
say to each other, and this is basically, I think, because one is
written from London, the heart of an empire, and the other from the
Canadian Shield, one of its many colonial margins. At least, as Derek
Gregory has put it, ''what seemed plausible in the lecture hall of the
Royal Geographical Society in London . . . might well become a half
truth on the ground'' (1998, 21). The distinction, perhaps, is between
studies of imperialism and of colonialism: imperialism ideologically
driven from the center and susceptible to conceptual analysis,
colonialism a set of activities on the periphery that are revealed as
practice (Young 2001, 16--17). Only a few geographers have tried to
bring both the imperial mind and the particularities of local colonial
circumstances into focus (e.g., Clayton 2000 and Lester 2001).

But [if the aim is to understand **colonialism** rather than the
workings of the **imperial mind**, then it would seem **essential** to
investigate the sites where colonialism was **actually practiced**. Its
effects were **displayed** there. The **strategies** and **tactics** on
which it relied were **actualized** there. There, in the **detail of
colonial dispossessions** and **repossessions**, the **relative weight**
of different agents of colonial power may **begin to be
assessed**]{.underline}. If [colonialism]{.underline} is the object of
investigation, then Tough's sparse Canadian Shield is promising terrain.
It [**was not detached** from London]{.underline}, of course, [and may
have been **profoundly influenced by elements of imperial thought** and
**culture**, but the extent of this influence **cannot be ascertained in
London**]{.underline}. Rather, I think, [one needs to **study the
colonial site itself**, **assess the displacements** that took place
there, and **seek to account for them**. To do so is to position studies
of colonialism in the **actuality** and **materiality** of colonial
experience. As that experience comes into focus, its **principal
causes** are to be assessed, among which **may well be**]{.underline}
something like the culture of [**imperialism**. To **proceed the other
way around** is to **impose a form of intellectual imperialism** on the
study of colonialism]{.underline}, a tendency to which the postcolonial
literature inclines.

The experienced materiality of colonialism is grounded, as many have
noted, in dispossessions and repossessions of land. Even Edward Said
(for all his emphasis on literary texts) described the essence of
colonialism this way: ''Underlying social space are territories, land,
geographical domains, the actual geographical underpinnings of the
imperial, and also the cultural contest. To think about distant places,
to colonize them, to populate or depopulate them: all of this occurs on,
about, or because of land. The actual geographical possession of land is
what empire in the final analysis is all about'' (1994, 78). Frantz
Fanon held that colonialism created a world ''divided into
compartments,'' a ''narrow world strewn with prohibitions,'' a ''world
without spaciousness.'' He maintained that a close examination of ''this
system of compartments'' would ''reveal the lines of force it implies.''
Moreover, ''this approach to the colonial world, its ordering and its
geographical layout will allow us to mark out the lines on which a
decolonized society will be reorganized'' (1963, 37--40).

Along the edge of empire that was early-modern British Columbia,
colonialism's''geographical layout'' was primarily expressed in a
reserve (reservation) system that allocated a small portion of the land
to native people and opened the rest for development. Native people were
in the way, their land was coveted, and settlers took it. The line
between the reserves and the rest---between the land set aside for the
people who had lived there from time immemorial and land made available
in various tenures to immigrants--- became the primary line on the map
of British Columbia. Eventually, there were approximately 1,500 small
reserves, slightly more than a third of 1 percent of the land of the
province. Native people had been placed in compartments by an aggressive
settler society that, like others of its kind, was far more interested
in native land than in the surplus value of native labor (Wolfe 1999,
1--3). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the scale of dispossession.

[At these sites of colonial dispossession, it seems **particularly
fruitful** to ask **by what means** it came about]{.underline}. The
common emphasis in the colonial discourse literature is reversed. [By
**starting not with texts**, **language**, and **strategies of
representation**, but with the **dispossession of colonized peoples** of
their land]{.underline}--- with, as it were, Figures 1 and 2---[the
**relative weight** of different colonial powers is **not prejudged**,
and the question becomes simply: **how was colonial power deployed** to
achieve this geographical effect? Rather than **writing from the
imperial center**, rather than investigating colonial subtexts within a
**particular category of texts**, the analysis turns on the **primary
effect** of a **particular settler colonialism** and on the **gamut of
colonial powers** that facilitated it. So situated, the **distinctive
roles of different components of the colonial arsenal** should begin to
**come into focus**]{.underline} (including maps like Figures 1 and 2).
[The cultural discourse of colonialism should begin to be
**contextualized**, and **some basis should be established** for the
**evaluation of salience**]{.underline}. Moreover, different theoretical
points of attachment should come into focus, and it should be possible
to sketch the work that particular bodies of theory accomplish.

This article is a rather schematic attempt to undertake such an analysis
and, on that basis, to offer some preliminary conclusions. In a recent
book on the reserve system in British Columbia (Harris 2002), I provide
more texture for those who wish it. Yet the very starkness of an article
that surveys an array of colonial powers may serve to emphasize my
argument and encourage the discussion of the relationships among
different forms of colonial power--- and of different ways of theorizing
them---out of which, I think, a more balanced geographical contribution
to the study of colonialism is likely to emerge. I deal with British
Columbia while assuming that my arguments bear, to some fair extent, on
other theaters of settler colonialism.

The Power to Dispassess

The problem of reserves in British Columbia arose with the establishment
of colonies and settlers some 70 years after people of European
background began to frequent its coastal waters. After commercial
capital reached the coast in the 1780s and 1790s, and the interior in
the first decade of the 19th century, trade became the basis of the
relationship between natives and nonnatives. The relationship was
frequently mediated by violence, sexual liaisons of various sorts, and
cross-cultural borrowing, but land was not at issue. Except for the few
acres within their palisaded forts and, in some cases, a little land
beyond for a farm or two, traders did not need it. For their purposes,
it was sufficient to insert a handful of outsiders in ships or forts
into native space.

But a territory had become known to the outside world, and its outline
had been mapped. In French sociologist Bruno Latour's terms, such
''inscriptions'' were transported to distant ''centers of calculation''
(1987, ch. 6). Sketchy information about a distant corner of North
America was processed, thousands of miles from its source, within
complex calculuses of diplomatic ambition, ideology, cultural
stereotypes, and raw geopolitical power (Clayton 2000). Spain
relinquished any claim to sovereignty along the north Pacific coast in
1795. Britain and the United States contended much longer, an intricate
diplomacy at times verging onwar thatwas settled only in 1846 when the
border between British North America and the United States was extended
along the 49th parallel to the Pacific. This agreement, the Oregon
Treaty, was a legal understanding between distant governments
''respecting the sovereignty and government of the territory on the
northwest coast of America.'' It did not mention native people. In the
eyes of the governments involved, the issue of sovereignty was settled.
Three years later, in response to the American settlement of Oregon and
the news of gold in California, the British government established the
proprietary colony of Vancouver Island. Then, in 1858, following a rush
of underemployed miners from California to the Fraser River, it
established the crown colony of British Columbia. As Daniel Clayton puts
it, ''native space was reproduced as an absolute space of British
sovereignty,'' (2000, 236) although initially, in the aftermath of the
Treaty of Waitangi and judicial rulings in New Zealand, officials in the
Colonial Office were uncertain about the extent to which British
sovereignty in these colonies was burdened by native title (Harris 2002,
15--16).

With the creation of these two colonies, land was framed in a new
problematic. Colonies entailed settlers, and settlers required land,
which could be got only by dispossessing native people. A relationship
based on trade was replaced by one based on land. As their land was
taken away, native people had to be put somewhere. A solution with many
precedents in other settler colonies was to put them on reserves.
Dispossession began in the 1850s and continued through the rest of the
century. Physical violence, the imperial state, colonial culture, and
self-interest all underlay it.

Violence. The establishment of colonies on Vancouver Island and the
mainland changed the nature of violence there. It had long accompanied
the fur trades. Coastal trading ships bristled with arms, greed was
rampant on both sides, cross-cultural misunderstandings were frequent,
and killing was the common result (Clayton 2000, ch. 6; Gibson 1992,
163, 170). In the interior, an axiom of the land-based fur trade was
that perceived assaults on the personnel or property of the traders
would be met with quick, spectacular displays of violence---sovereign
power in the Foucaultian sense, though without a validating regime of
rights (Harris 1997, ch. 2). Nor was the gold rush peaceable. Miners
arrived with the latest weaponry (including six-shooters and
spiral-bored rifles) and tactics of Indian fighting worked out in the
American southwest. At the first sign of trouble, they organized
themselves into companies, elected officers, and advanced in
paramilitary formation. But with the creation of settler colonies, a new
level of organization and calculation---the British military---was built
into the equation of violence (Gough 1984). British warships operated
along the coast; a detachment of Royal Engineers was sent out to survey
land and maintain order. Such power was more often displayed than
used---a few quick and very public hangings of suspected murderers after
summary trials on the quarterdeck of one of Her Majesty's warships, or a
few villages shelled and destroyed---spectacles intended to instill
fear. Officials considered such power ''a grand persuasive.'' Some held
that it saved lives by preventing settler--native wars. Frequently, they
judged it sufficient to anchor a warship just off a native village and
ostentatiously prepare the guns.

In the interior, the space beyond the reach of a ship's guns, the
military equation was more balanced. In the 1870s, as settlers were
moving in and preempting land, many natives leaders talked of war.
Settlers feared, perhaps with justification, that a native uprising
could wipe all of them out in a single night. But, as the chiefs knew, a
shortterm victory was one thing; keeping at bay settlers and the armies
that, sooner or later, would back them up was quite another. The results
of wars across the border in which native warriors (some from British
Columbia) had fought federal U.S. troops, was evidence in hand. Those
who counseled war did so out of desperation. One chief put it this way:
''A war with the white man will end in our destruction, but death in war
is not so bad as death by starvation'' (cited in Harris 2002, 206).
Overall, the balance of physical power lay overwhelmingly with the
state.

The imperial state. From the vantage point of London, Vancouver Island
and British Columbia were two remote and relatively inconsequential
colonies. Imperial attention focused, rather, on India and Ireland.
After the advent of free trade in 1846, the role of settler colonies in
the imperial scheme of things had become increasingly murky. Earl Grey,
secretary of state for the colonies when the colony of Vancouver Island
was created, held that colonies returned important image value for a
great power and also that the honor of the crown required it to protect
British settlers overseas (who had chosen to settle within the British
empire) and also to protect native people from settlers who, left to
their own devices, would probably exterminate them (Grey 1853, vol. 1,
letter 1). Yet the coffers of the Lords of the Treasury opened
reluctantly for honor, and British settler colonies around the world
were expected to support themselves. Moreover, the duty of the crown to
protect native people from settlers conflicted with the Colonial
Office's growing willingness to accord responsible government. As
liberal humanitarian sentiments about the essential oneness of human
kind and the opportunity to create a world of civilized, Christian
people faded, responsible government came to dominate protection in
Colonial Office thought (Metcalf 1996; Porter 1999). In settler
colonies, where access to land was the predominant issue, only a hollow
form of responsible government would exclude land policy from colonial
jurisdiction. In effect, by the late 1840s and 1850s, the Colonial
Office had no clear, consistent native policy. As a result, when the
colony of Vancouver Island was created, it was readily inclined to turn
over the management of native people to the Hudson's Bay Company (which,
it thought, had handled them much better than the Americans) and to rely
on the judgment of the fur trader-cum-governor (George Douglas), who
managed both colonies until his retirement in 1864. Thereafter, land
policies were formulated by local settler politicians. The Colonial
Office hardly interfered, and in 1871 when BritishColumbia became a
Canadian province, land policy, now constitutionally a provincial
responsibility within the Canadian confederation, remained in the hands
of these same politicians. The state created a framework for the ordered
development of a settler society, but did not, itself, provide the
momentum for the development of that society or for the dispossessions
and repossessions of land that accompanied it. When power passed to
local politicians, they reflected the values and interests of their
constituents.

Culture. The assumptions about the colonized other analyzed in the
colonial discourse literature were pervasive in early modern British
Columbia. Hardly a white person questioned the distinction between
civilization and savagery or the association of the former with
Europeans and the latter with native people. Nor did they question the
proposition that civilized people knew how to use land properly and that
savages did not. From these assumptions it followed that until Europeans
arrived, most of the land was waste, or, where native people were
obviously using it, that their uses were inadequate. Nor was there room
for alternative understandings of civilized modernity. Rather, thought
about native people focused on a simple binary: civilization and
savagery with little of consequence between. From this it followed that
if native people did not become civilized, and if, in a changing world,
it was no longer possible for them to be savage, then they would die
out, a common prediction in British Columbia well into the 20th century.

These social constructions were assumed, not debated. They pervaded
thought about native people in the Colonial Office, in political,
administrative, legal, and missionary circles in British Columbia, and
in the settler mind. An Indian reserve commissioner, charged with laying
out reserves, said this to a native audience on Vancouver Island in
1876:

Many years ago you were in darkness killing each other and making slaves
was your trade. The Land was of no value to you. The trees were of no
value to you. The Coal was of no value to you. The white man came he
improved the land you can follow his example---he cuts the trees and
pays you to help him. He takes the coal out of the ground and he pays
you to help him---you are improving fast. The Government protects you,
you are rich---You live in peace and have everything you want. ---(cited
in Harris 2002, 108)

At the time, few if any white settlers would have disagreed. There were
arguments about how quickly native people could be assimilated and,
therefore, about how much land should be allocated to them. Some
settlers, biological racists to the core, considered natives utterly
lazy, degenerate, and unredeemable; but a few found much to appreciate
or pity in native lives, were well disposed toward native people nearby,
and now and then supported their pleas for more reserve land. But even
kindness--- tinged by an educated, romantic appreciation of nature and,
therefore, of lives assumed to live close to nature--- was situated
within the assumptions of the civilization/ savage binary. So was
salvage anthropology, which in the influential presence of Franz Boas
reached the coast late in the 19th century, there intent upon recovering
the uncontaminated primitive condition. Boas had little interest in the
native societies around him(which, he thought, were becoming civilized),
except insofar as they supplied informants about earlier, precontact
times.

These values had not been invented in British Columbia. As a
considerable literature has shown (e.g., Seed 1995; Hulme and Jordanova
1990; Buckle 1991; Arneil 1996), some of them were as old as the
European connection with the New World and had surfaced in the first
European theorizing about their rights there by the Spanish theologian
Francisco de Vitoria in the 1530s, or by the Dutch legal theorist Hugo
Grotius a century later. They were powerfully and influentially
elaborated by John Locke (\[1690\] 1947, ch. 5) in his labor theory of
property. Locke held that God's gift of land to Adam and his posterity
acquired value only as labor was expended on it, and that labor
justified individual property rights. Those who did not labor on the
land wandered over what Locke called unassisted nature, land that
yielded little and lay in common. This, he thought, was the condition of
America before European settlers arrived. The land was ''a wild common
of Nature,'' the original condition of the world before labor was
expended on land and benefits accrued therefrom. Hence his famous
dictum: ''In the beginning, all the world was America.'' In all the
early settler colonies, ordinary (frequently illiterate)
settlers---people who had never heard of Vitoria, Grotius, or
Locke---held unsophisticated versions of these views.

By the mid-19th century, [these]{.underline} old and pervasive [ideas
were]{.underline} powerfully [reinforced by]{.underline} an increasingly
strident [racism]{.underline} and the achievements of industrial
production. These years were the high water mark of ''scientific''
racism. The ideas of phrenologists, craniometricians, and polygenesists
were in the air, and after Darwin's The Origin of Species (published in
1859), it could be argued that, even if humans shared a common origin,
there had been ample time for evolution to take different courses and
produce different peoples. The very achievements of industrial society
were the measure, it seemed, of an evolutionary advantage. The lurid
tales of the massacres of English women and children at Morant Bay in
Jamaica, or, later, at Lucknow and Cawnpore during the Indian Mutiny,
confirmed in many minds the absurdity of treating natives as the equal
of whites. Such judgments reached British Columbia. Even **[more
important]{.underline}**, I think, as the historian Michael Adas has
pointed out, [was the **growing technological gulf** between Europe and
the rest of the world and the **tangible measure it provided** of the
**disjunction**]{.underline} between civilization and savagery (Adas
1989). [**European weaponry** and **military discipline** had made
conquest **relatively easy**]{.underline} (Headrick 1981). [Contrasts
between Europeans and others **seemed obvious**: **machine power**
versus **animal** or **human power**, **progress** versus
**stagnation**, **science** versus **superstition**. The **whole
material paraphernalia** of European modernity was a **tangible
yardstick of superiority**, and the **idea of progress**, conceived in
these **material terms**, was **in the air as never
before**]{.underline}. Moreover, as the historian Mark Francis has
shown, [if civilization and progress came to be **equated with
technology**]{.underline} and material wealth, [then a **measurable
standard had been invented** that native people **could not
attain**]{.underline} (Francis 1998). [They could be **mannered**, but
they **could not match European technologies** or **material wealth**.
Nor did they have the Europeans' **growing ability to
dominate**]{.underline} nature, another measure of progress. People who
marked the land lightly and lived within the rhythms of nature were
obviously unprogressive and backward. If civilization were measured in
these terms, then native societies must be savage. For British
Columbians of European background, the conclusion was obvious, and the
rhetoric surrounding civilization, savagery, and unused land awaiting
development was pervasive and uncontested.

To heighten my own digital defense practice, I recently took a virtual
workshop offered by the New York-based [Tech Learning
Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/). This [collective
provides technology education for radical organizers and revolutionary
communities with special attention to underserved groups]{.underline}.
These groups, which design tools and training for activists, are not a
new occurrence. They have an interesting history across varying
political cultures dating back, at the very least, to the national
liberation struggles of the 20th century. Let's take two of these, both
armed struggles.

The first was the work of the section technique (technical branch)
within the Front de Libération Nationale, the movement at the head of
the Algerian struggle against French colonialism. In his essay, "Ici la
voix d'Algérie" ("[This Is the Voice of
Algeria](http://www.campusincamps.ps/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fanon-this-is-the-voice-of-algeria.pdf)"),
Frantz Fanon describes the section technique's secret, mobile shortwave
radio, whose transmitter was mounted on a moving truck that broadcast
revolutionary messages from inside Algeria. [The broadcast included
information on the fighting, the history of the Algerian people,
political and military commentaries, patriotic songs, and religious
sermons encouraging commitment to the country's freedom and
independence]{.underline}. [To listen to the revolutionary broadcast,
most Algerians had to get their hands on radio sets designed by Algerian
radio technicians]{.underline}, who had started opening shops for the
sale of secondhand radio sets. The technicians had innovated in
producing battery-powered radio in a country that, for the most part,
lacked electrification. **[Fanon suggests that the purchase of these
radio sets did not mean "the adoption of a modern technique for getting
news, but the obtaining of access to the only means of entering into
communication with the Revolution, of living with it]{.underline}**."
[In other words, Algerians were not simply listening to the broadcast or
adopting an information technology for narrow instrumental
purposes]{.underline}; [rather, something changed in their disposition
as a result of their participation in the broadcasts as
listeners.]{.underline}

[When French authorities understood the power of the Voice of Algeria as
a force coming from outside the disciplinary mechanism of the colonial
state, they passed a series of laws to prohibit the sale of radio sets
to Algerians in order to restrict their access to the
broadca]{.underline}sts. Further[, as French forces were unable to take
hold of the transmitter---they tried to bomb the truck that carried it,
with no success---the only way to silence this revolutionary voice was
to try to jam the airwaves]{.underline}. [But even with French jamming
attempts, the existence of the revolutionary broadcast was sometimes
more important symbolically than being able to grasp its every word and
sentence]{.underline}. Every evening, "[Algerians would imagine not only
words, but concrete battles," Fanon says, thereby strengthening the
national consciousness]{.underline}. [The Voice of Algeria became a tool
for the revolution not only through its technical branch---that is, its
broadcast content---but also performatively, as the mere technical
possibility of the broadcasts, against all odds and attempts to
suppress, confirmed that the revolution was alive]{.underline}.

The second [example comes from the technical committee that supported
the South African national liberation struggle. From the late 1950s
until the early 1990s, a technical committee developed technical
artifacts and trained freedom fighters and their foreign comrades on how
to use these tools to support the struggle]{.underline}. The technical
committee's approach to science and technology was influenced by major
Cold War events such as the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957. It was not only
state actors, such as the American government, that were influenced by
Sputnik 1, sparking an ambitious scientific and technological research
program that would lead to the creation of the Internet. The launch
would also influence the scientific and technological orientation of a
national liberation movement.

After it was forced into exile, the technical committee and its members
continued to operate in the United Kingdom. [They designed tools for the
people such as "leaflet bombs," harmless leaflet launchers which would
explode in crowded areas and facilitate the mass distribution of
handouts]{.underline}. The first scene from the 2020 film, [Escape from
Pretoria,](https://youtu.be/g6sJ3FOhs8U) is a good representation of how
leaflet bombs worked and how white South Africans and foreigners
especially could use their white privilege for the struggle as they
easily navigated white areas. The committee also created small boxes
containing audio amplifiers connected to tape recorders which would be
left in crowded areas, often in townships, by freedom fighters. Thanks
to a timing device, these boxes would then play a short, five-minute
message once the operative was away.

[Probably the most sophisticated project of the technical committee was
an [encrypted communication
system](https://hackcur.io/operation-vula/) that allowed freedom
fighters to communicate secretly and transnationally between South
Africa, Zambia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Canada in the
late 1980s. Over almost a decade, the technical committee experimented
with newly available technologies of the time such as
telematics]{.underline} (combining computers and telephones), computer
programming, and encryption, while at the same time training freedom
fighters and their comrades to operate such systems. These communication
systems later came to be included in Operation Vula in the mid-1980s, an
operation that aimed to launch a people's war.

[These two examples show how contemporary tech collectives are rooted in
a wider history of technical skills, tools, and groups supporting past
and current struggles]{.underline}. In fact, the practical investment of
national liberation struggles with science, technology, and
communication are practices that might be more widespread than we think.
[Only by digging further into these radical science and technology
traditions across varying political cultures will we have access to a
different set of materials and ideas to think about what revolutionary
science, technology, and communications can]{.underline}
[do]{.underline}.
