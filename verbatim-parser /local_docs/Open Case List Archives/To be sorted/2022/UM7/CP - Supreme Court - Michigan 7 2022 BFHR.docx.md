### 1NC --- CP: Supreme Court

#### The United States federal judiciary should prohibit security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

#### That reverses [current precedent]{.underline} of non-interference --- otherwise, executive [unilateralism]{.underline} and [adventurism]{.underline} will accelerate.

A common definition of ~~insanity~~
\[**[[irrationality]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [is doing the same thing
**over and over again** and expecting different results]{.underline}.
That's not a bad [[summary of]{.mark} the decades]{.underline}-old
[[debate over]{.underline}]{.mark} the [scope of the
[president's]{.mark} constitutional [authority to use military force
without]{.mark} congressional [authorization]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
has been rekindled by the military operation against Qasem
[Soleimani]{.underline} --- and the [Trump]{.underline} administration's
[**constantly evolving** legal justifications]{.underline} for the
strike. Over and over, from the Nixon administration onward, scholars
and executive branch lawyers have debated the circumstances in which the
Constitution allows the president to go it alone. And over and over,
those debates have ended without any formal resolution of who was right
and who was wrong. All [we're left with]{.underline}, as seems
increasingly likely with respect to Soleimani's death, is the creation
of yet [another **historical precedent** for the executive branch to
point to when defending **unilateral presidential warmaking** in the
future]{.underline}.

The [[reason for]{.mark} the [indeterminacy]{.mark}]{.underline} of this
debate [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} simple enough: [Over the past
half-century]{.underline}, federal [[courts]{.mark} have **essentially
[stopped]{.mark}** even [attempting to resolve]{.mark} disputes between
Congress and the White House over [war powers]{.mark}]{.underline}. But
the [[Constitution does not require]{.underline}]{.mark} such
**[[judicial passivity]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and the Soleimani
strike helps to drive home its very real costs. Ultimately, we may not
agree with how the courts would police the separation of war powers
between the political branches. But allowing them to do so may be
increasingly preferable to letting things continue this way.

The [[idea]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[courts have **little role** to
play]{.mark} in war powers]{.underline} disputes [[is]{.mark} of
[**entirely recent** vintage]{.mark}]{.underline}. [From]{.underline}
the [Quasi-War with [France]{.mark}]{.underline} that began in 1798
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the [conflict in
[Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[Supreme Court **routinely settled**
major]{.mark} **war powers [questions]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- often
in the middle of the relevant conflict. Indeed, the justices' only
significant discussion of the scope of the president's inherent
constitutional war powers came in March 1863, when, with the outcome of
the Civil War very much in doubt, a divided court ruled, 5 to 4, that
President Abraham Lincoln's blockade of Confederate ports at the outset
of hostilities had been legal. During World War I, the court weighed in,
among other things, on the constitutionality of the draft. More than two
decades later, the justices convened a special session in the middle of
World War II to consider the legality of trying Nazi saboteurs before a
military commission. And one of the court's most significant
separation-of-powers decisions came in June 1952, when the justices
invalidated President Harry S. Truman's unilateral seizure of steel
mills to avoid having a strike interfere with military production during
the Korean War. Although the justices often disagreed about the results
in these cases, they never disputed that it was appropriate for the
court to resolve them.

That changed during Vietnam, as justices twisted themselves into
pretzels to avoid weighing in on the legality of various aspects of U.S.
military operations in Southeast Asia, and lower courts followed suit.
Among other things, the courts repeatedly relied upon "justiciability"
doctrines to hold that different cases did not properly raise the
underlying separation-of-powers questions, involved the wrong
plaintiffs, sought the wrong kind of relief or were premature or moot.
The result of this sideline-sitting was to leave the debate entirely to
the political process --- which, not surprisingly, never produced a
conclusive resolution as to the limits on the president's constitutional
power. Even the War Powers Resolution, which Congress enacted over
President Richard M. Nixon's veto at the end of the conflict in an
attempt to rein in future unilateral presidential warmaking, didn't
attempt to draw a substantive line between the president's power and the
legislature's; all it did was impose a series of procedural constraints
--- most of which have proved woefully ineffective.

Five myths about war powers

Compared with Vietnam, the courts have been marginally more involved in
post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism cases. But the substantive rulings have
come almost exclusively in cases brought by detainees --- where an
individual's liberty hangs in the balance. Thus, courts have never
weighed in on whether the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force
applies to the fight against the Islamic State --- one of the central
legal questions in contemporary counterterrorism policy --- at least
largely because the United States has, perhaps deliberately, not held
any ISIS detainees long enough for their cases to be resolved. Thus, as
Justice Stephen G. Breyer recently complained, even as the war Congress
authorized days after Sept. 11, 2001, enters its 19th year, a number of
its central legal questions remain unanswered. Reasonable people may
disagree about what the answers ought to be. But the lack of any answers
only favors the executive branch, for better or worse.

Of course, there is no reason to expect the courts to reverse this trend
on their own. And Congress could try to assert itself in other ways,
including by cutting off funding for military operations of which it
disapproves. But any attempt by Congress to reclaim substantive
authority would likely raise additional legal questions --- and so we
would be right back where we started. Instead, or in addition, Congress
could give the courts a nudge --- by passing legislation designed to
make it easier for the judicial system to reach the merits of these
cases. For instance, Congress could clarify who can sue in such cases;
what kinds of claims they are allowed to bring; and what kind of relief
they are allowed to pursue. The Constitution still will impose some
limits on the contours of such a statute, but it's hard to imagine
courts being quite as skeptical in the face of affirmative legislation
inviting them to intervene --- especially if, as I've proposed
elsewhere, the suits are only allowed after the fact and don't ask the
courts to block ongoing U.S. military operations.

The [idea of **[judicial intervention]{.mark}** in war
powers]{.underline} disputes will [certainly strike some as
radical]{.underline}. [But it hasn't been historically]{.underline}.
[And]{.underline} even [[in modern times]{.underline}]{.mark}, it seems
[[**increasingly preferable** to]{.mark} the
[alternative]{.mark}]{.underline} --- in which the [[executive
branch]{.underline}]{.mark}, across different administrations and
political parties, [will [**only continue** to accumulate]{.mark} **more
and [more power]{.mark}** [to use military force **on its
own**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the only realistic checks on that power
will come at the ballot box. It is hard to imagine that this is the
separation of powers the Founding Fathers had in mind --- or that the
current Supreme Court would champion. But even if it is, it seems
**[increasingly clear]{.underline}** that [it would be better to have
the matter settled]{.underline}, [rather than waiting to have the **same
debate** all over again]{.underline} the [next time the president **goes
it alone**]{.underline}.

The [[**Untenability** of Unilateral Action]{.underline}]{.mark}

Yet, [there is surely merit in [taking]{.mark}]{.underline} this
potentially [[**apocalyptic decision** out of the hands of one

merit bringing in others for concurrence on a momentous nuclear weapons
decision, but the [[issue extends **far beyond**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Judge [Bork]{.underline}, on the other hand, [**dismissed** the **case**
on the ground that \"\[n\]either]{.underline} the law of nations nor any
[of the **relevant treaties** provides a cause of action]{.underline}
that [appellants may **assert in courts** of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates,\" reasoning that Congress\'s grant of ATS
jurisdiction did not, in itself, create a cause of action that
individuals could enforce in municipal courts. Judge Bork found that the
plaintiffs did not seek to enforce a statutory nor a constitutional
right, as required to invoke the power of the court. [Relying
on]{.underline} (1) t[he **[p]{.mark}**]{.underline}olitical
**[[q]{.underline}]{.mark}**uestion **[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**octrine
\--[which [contends]{.mark} that]{.underline} some issues, such as
[**[fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy** issues, [are]{.mark} better [left
to the political]{.mark} process [than **judicial**]{.mark}
**intervention**]{.underline}; and (2) the act of state doctrine \--in
which sovereign immunity precludes the U.S. courts from inquiring into
the validity of the acts of a foreign sovereign in its own territory,
Judge Bork further reasoned that separation of powers principles
prevented the court from establishing a cause of action. [Recognizing
a]{.underline} new [cause of action]{.underline}, in Judge Bork\'s
opinion, [would require]{.underline} \[\*832\] [the court to
analyze]{.underline} principles of [**international law**
that]{.underline} are not clearly defined and [may touch \"sharply on
**national nerves**,\"]{.underline} and create an exception to the
general rule that international law only binds state actors. Further, it
follows from Filartiga\'s reasoning that if there exists an individual
right to bring claims under the law of nations, then there also exists a
cause of action for any violation of the treaties to which the United
States is a party. Bork cautioned that this line of reasoning was
absurd, because it would mean, \"all existing treaties became, and all
future treaties will become, in effect, self-executing when ratified.\"
Bork also noted that there was no international consensus on whether
terrorism violated the law of nations, that no treaty provided
individuals with a right to seek damages, and that at the time of the
enactment of ATS, the concept of international human rights law simply
did not exist. Bork concluded that \"unless a modern statute, treaty, or
executive agreement provided a private cause of action for violations of
new international norms which do not themselves contemplate private
enforcement,\" it was not the role of the court to develop new causes of
action under ATS.

Judge [Bork contended]{.underline} that [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Filartiga [[court]{.mark}\'s formulation]{.underline} of ATS [would
**[run contrary]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the Constitution [[by]{.mark}
**allowing the court** to [**meddle** in]{.mark} the **[other]{.mark}
branches\'** [powers to decide]{.mark}]{.underline} matters of
[**[foreign relations]{.mark}** under Articles I and II]{.underline}.
Following this reasoning, Judge Robb found that [the case could not be
adjudicated on [the **basis** of]{.mark} the
**[p]{.mark}**]{.underline}olitical \[\*833\]
**[[q]{.underline}]{.mark}**uestion **[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**octrine.
Judge Robb further warned that [adjudicating **controversial foreign
policy issues** [was a **slippery slope**, given]{.mark}]{.underline}
each nation\'s differing notions of terrorism, and [that
[\"**each**]{.mark}]{.underline} supposed [[**scenario** carries]{.mark}
with it [a]{.mark}n incredibly **complex [calculus]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**actors**, **circumstances**, and **geopolitical
[considerations]{.mark}**[.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} This debate over the
foreign policy implications of ATS jurisdiction persists today, and
appears in Kiobel as a basis for rejecting corporate liability. Judges
Bork\'s and Robb\'s [concurrences were **very influential** during
the]{.underline} twenty-year period between Tel-Oren and the [Supreme
Court\'s decision]{.underline} in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain. During this
time, only the Second and Ninth Circuits allowed ATS claims\--other
courts continued to rely on Tel-Oren to conclude that ATS jurisdiction
did not apply over ATS plaintiffs\' alleged claims.

Political Question Doctrine to Congressional Force Authorizations";
*Just Security*;
<https://www.justsecurity.org/36021/troubling-application-political-question-doctrine-congressional-force-authorizations/>

[The]{.underline} U.S. District [[Court]{.underline}]{.mark} for the
District of Columbia on Nov. 21 [[dismissed]{.mark} the
[suit]{.mark}]{.underline} brought by U.S. Army Captain Nathan Michael
Smith [[challenging]{.mark} the [**legality** of the]{.mark} **military
[campaign]{.mark}** [against ISIS]{.mark}]{.underline} under Operation
Inherent Resolve. The opinion by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly
[**rejecting** the suit [on **p**]{.mark}**olitical [q]{.mark}uestion**
[grounds]{.mark}]{.underline} is troubling. (Judge Kollar-Kotelly also
denied Smith had standing based on his claim that continuing to fight in
an unauthorized military action against ISIS would violate his oath to
support and defend the Constitution). The Obama administration's release
last month of its Report on the Legal and Policy Frameworks Guiding and
Limiting the United States' Use of Military Force and Related National
Security Considerations ("Framework Report"), while admirable in several
respects (see Marty Lederman's comprehensive summary), crystalizes
concerns about the potential ramifications of the political question
ruling in Smith v Obama.

In Smith, the plaintiff maintained that neither the 2001 nor 2002
Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)---the former enacted for
al Qaeda and the Taliban, the latter for Iraq---constituted
authorization for military action against ISIS. Such action, the
plaintiff therefore argued, was unlawful under the 60-day time limit
imposed by the War Powers Resolution. [The]{.underline} district [court
[held]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the suit]{.mark} presented a
[**nonjusticiable** political question]{.mark}]{.underline} because the
issues raised were primarily ones committed to the political branches of
government and because the court lacked judicially manageable standards.
This holding, as Michael Glennon has argued here, and Marty has argued
here, here, and here, misconstrues and misapplies the political question
doctrine. In short, a suit asking a court to interpret the scope and
meaning of a congressional force statute---and, particularly, what
entities it applies to---presents a legal question squarely within the
province and ability of the judiciary to decide.

Smith's suit, in the court's view, would have failed anyway for lack of
standing. But [[the]{.mark} court's [**political question**
ruling]{.mark} **sweeps more** widely and [if followed, would **bar
suit** by]{.mark} **future [plaintiffs]{.mark}** [raising]{.mark}
similar merits [claims even where they]{.mark} unquestionably [had
**standing**. Those]{.mark} future plaintiffs could [include]{.mark},
for example, [individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} detained by the United
States or [[harmed by U.S. **drone strikes**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(including family members of individuals killed in such strikes). The
ruling would foreclose those persons from claiming that the U.S. action
was illegal if it were predicated on their connection to ISIS or to
another group that fell outside current force authorizations.

The Obama administration's Framework Report underscores these concerns,
particularly as executive power is handed to a Trump administration that
could jettison existing policy constraints while further enlarging
America's forever war against terrorist groups.

The Framework Report highlights several broader trends. First, [it
reinforces that the U.S. armed conflict against al Qaeda and the Taliban
seems **only to expand**, not contract, with time]{.underline}. Since
2001, [it has extended to]{.underline} other groups, whether because
they fall under the al Qaeda umbrella (like [ISIS) or]{.underline} are
deemed associated forces (as [al-Shabaab]{.underline} recently was).

Second, the Report underscores that, under the current framework, the
president generally has authority---even if he does not exercise it---to
detain and target individuals based solely on their purported membership
in a military group covered by the 2001 AUMF. That authority thus
permits status-based detention or targeting, without resort to claims of
self-defense.

Third, the Report reinforces that additional restrictions on this broad
legal authority exist only as a matter of policy. As such, they may be
discarded by the next administration. Further, the policies
themselves---which apply heightened requirements for using lethal force
outside areas of active hostilities---have proven susceptible to
workarounds in practice (See the valuable New York Times reporting by
Charlie Savage, Eric Schmitt, and Mark Mazzetti on how in Somalia the
U.S. military has avoided limitations in the May 2013 Presidential
Policy Guidance through assertions of an independent power of collective
self-defense, which includes assistance to U.S. partners on the ground).

[[Courts]{.mark} remain [a]{.mark}n **important [check]{.mark}** [on
**elastic c**]{.mark}ounter**[t]{.mark}**errorism [powers]{.mark}. This
check will become [even more important in]{.mark} a **Trump
[admin]{.mark}**istration [that]{.mark} **expansively
[interprets]{.mark}** [existing]{.mark}]{.underline}---or
future---[force [authorizations]{.mark}]{.underline} while disregarding
restraints. [In the past, suits [challenging]{.mark} particular **[drone
strikes]{.mark}**]{.underline}---both ex-ante and ex-post---[[have
been]{.mark} **dismissed**]{.underline} on threshold justiciability
grounds. Smith, however, is the first decision to hold that the central
underlying question---the meaning and scope of executive power under a
congressional force authorization---is itself [[a **political
question**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Smith explained "Plaintiff asks the
Court to second-guess the Executive's application of these statutes to
specific facts on the ground in an ongoing combat mission halfway around
the world" (emphasis in original). Smith's rationale would prevent other
challenges to the application of force authorizations not only to ISIS,
but also to other, yet unidentified, groups.

The race for drones

An important, but overlooked, strategic consequence of [the]{.underline}
Obama administration's [embrace of drones]{.underline} is that it [has
generated a **new and dangerous arms race** for this
technology]{.underline}. At present, the use of lethal drones is seen as
acceptable to US policy-makers because no other state possesses the
ability to make highly sophisticated drones with the range, surveillance
capability and lethality of those currently manufactured by the United
States. Yet [the rest of the world is **not far behind**. At least **76
[countries]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} acquired [UAV tech]{.mark}nology,
including **Russia**, **China**, **Pakistan** and
**India**]{.underline}.120 China is reported to have at least 25
separate drone systems currently in development.121 At present, [there
are 680 drone programmes in the world, an increase of over 400 since
2005]{.underline}.122 [Many states]{.underline} and non-state actors
hostile to the United States [have begun to dabble in drone
technology]{.underline}. Iran has created its own drone, dubbed the
'Ambassador of Death', which has a range of up to 600 miles.123 Iran has
also allegedly supplied the Assad regime in Syria with drone
technology.124 Hezbollah launched an Iranian-made drone into Israeli
territory, where it was shot down by the Israeli air force in October
2012.125

[A **global [arms race]{.mark}** for drone technology is **already
[under way]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to one estimate, [global
spending on drones is likely to be more than US\$94 billion by
2021]{.underline}.126 One factor that is facilitating the spread of
drones (particularly non-lethal drones) is their cost relative to other
military purchases. The top-of-the line Predator or Reaper model costs
approximately US\$10.5 million each, compared to the US\$150 million
price tag of a single F-22 fighter jet.127 At that price, drone
technology is already within the reach of most developed militaries,
many of which will seek to buy drones from the US or another supplier.
[With demand growing, a number of states]{.underline}, including China
and Israel, [have begun the aggressive selling of]{.underline} drones,
including [attack drones]{.underline}, and Russia may also be moving
into this market.128 Because of concerns that export restrictions are
harming US competitiveness in the drones market, the Pentagon has
granted approval for drone exports to 66 governments and is currently
being lobbied to authorize sales to even more.129 The Obama
administration has already authorized the sale of drones to the UK and
Italy, but Pakistan, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been refused drone
technology by congressional restrictions.130 It is only a matter of time
before another supplier steps in to offer the drone technology to
countries prohibited by export controls from buying US drones. According
to a study by the Teal Group, the US will account for 62 per cent of
research and development spending and 55 per cent of procurement
spending on drones by 2022.131 As the market expands, with new buyers
and sellers, America's ability to control the sale of drone technology
will be diminished. It is likely that the US will retain a substantial
qualitative advantage in drone technology for some time, but even that
will fade as more suppliers offer drones that can match US capabilities.

[The emergence of this arms race for drones raises]{.underline} at least
five long-term [strategic consequences]{.underline}, not all of which
are favourable to the United States over the long term. First, it is now
obvious that other states will use drones in ways that are inconsistent
with US interests. One reason why the US has been so keen to use drone
technology in Pakistan and Yemen is that at present it retains a
substantial advantage in high-quality attack drones. Many of the other
states now capable of employing drones of near-equivalent
technology---for example, the UK and Israel---are considered allies. But
this situation is quickly changing as other leading geopolitical
players, such as Russia and China, are beginning rapidly to develop and
deploy drones for their own purposes. While its own technology still
lags behind that of the US, Russia has spent huge sums on purchasing
drones and has recently sought to buy the Israeli-made Eitan drone
capable of surveillance and firing air-to-surface missiles.132 China has
begun to develop UAVs for reconnaissance and combat and has several new
drones capable of long-range surveillance and attack under
development.133 China is also planning to use unmanned surveillance
drones to allow it to monitor the disputed East China Sea Islands, which
are currently under dispute with Japan and Taiwan.134 Both Russia and
China will pursue this technology and develop their own drone suppliers
which will sell to the highest bidder, presumably with fewer export
controls than those imposed by the US Congress. Once both governments
have equivalent or near-equivalent levels of drone technology to the
United States, they will be similarly tempted to use it for surveillance
or attack in the way the US has done. Thus, through its own
over-reliance on drones in places such as Pakistan and Yemen, the US may
be hastening the arrival of a world where its qualitative advantages in
drone technology are eclipsed and where this technology will be used and
sold by rival Great Powers whose interests do not mirror its own.

A second consequence of the spread of drones is that [many of the
traditional concepts which have **underwritten [stability]{.mark}** in
the international system [will be]{.mark} **radically
[reshaped]{.mark}** by drone technology. [For
example]{.mark},]{.underline} much of the [stability among]{.underline}
the [Great Powers]{.underline} in the international system [is driven
by]{.underline} deterrence, specifically **[nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.135 Deterrence operates with informal
rules of the game and tacit bargains that govern what states,
particularly those holding nuclear weapons, may and may not do to one
another.136 While it is widely understood that nuclear-capable states
will conduct aerial surveillance and spy on one another, [overt military
confrontations between nuclear powers are rare because they are assumed
to be costly and prone to **escalation**. One open question is
whether]{.underline} these [states will exercise]{.underline} the same
level of [restraint with [drone surveillance]{.mark}, which [is]{.mark}
unmanned, [low cost, and]{.mark} possibly [deniable]{.mark}. States
may]{.underline} be more willing to engage in drone overflights which
test the resolve of their rivals, or [engage in **'salami
tactics'**]{.underline} to see what kind of drone-led incursion, if any,
will motivate a response.137 This may have been Hezbollah's logic in
sending a drone into Israeli airspace in October 2012, possibly to relay
information on Israel's nuclear capabilities.138 After the incursion,
both Hezbollah and Iran boasted that the drone incident demonstrated
their military capabilities.139 One could imagine two rival states---for
example, India and Pakistan---deploying drones to test each other's
capability and resolve, with untold consequences if such a probe were
misinterpreted by the other as an attack. As drones get physically
smaller and more precise, and as they develop a greater flying range,
the temptation to use them to spy on a rival's nuclear programme or
military installations might prove too strong to resist. If this were to
happen, [[drones]{.underline}]{.mark} might gradually
[[erode]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**deterrent
[relations]{.mark}**hips]{.underline} that exist [[between]{.mark}
**nuclear [powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thus
**[[magnifying]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[risks of]{.mark} a spiral
of [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** between them.

[Another dimension]{.underline} of this problem [has to do with the risk
of **accident**. Drones are **prone to [accidents]{.mark} and
crashes**]{.underline}. By July 2010, the US Air Force had identified
approximately 79 drone accidents.140 Recently released documents have
revealed that there have been a number of drone accidents and crashes in
the Seychelles and Djibouti, some of which happened in close proximity
to civilian airports.141 The rapid proliferation of drones worldwide
will involve a risk of accident to civilian aircraft, possibly producing
an international incident if such an accident were to involve an
aircraft affiliated to a state hostile to the owner of the drone. Most
of the drone accidents may be innocuous, but [some will carry
**strategic risks**]{.underline}. In December 2011, a CIA drone designed
for nuclear surveillance crashed in Iran, revealing the existence of the
spying programme and leaving sensitive technology in the hands of the
Iranian government.142 The expansion of drone technology raises the
possibility that some of these surveillance drones will be interpreted
as attack drones, or that [an accident or crash [will **spiral**]{.mark}
**out of control** [and lead to]{.mark} an **armed
[confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.143 An accident would be even more
dangerous if the US were to pursue its plans for nuclear-powered drones,
which can spread radioactive material like a dirty bomb if they
crash.144

Third, lethal [drones create the possibility that the **[norms]{.mark}**
on the use of force [will **erode**]{.mark}, creating a **much more
dangerous world** and [pushing]{.mark} the international [system]{.mark}
back [towards]{.mark} the **rule of the [jungle]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
To some extent, this world is already being ushered in by the United
States, which has set a dangerous precedent that a state may simply kill
foreign citizens considered a threat without a declaration of war. Even
John Brennan has recognized that the US is 'establishing a precedent
that other nations may follow'.145 Given this precedent, there is
nothing to stop other states from following the American lead and using
drone strikes to eliminate potential threats. Those 'threats' need not
be terrorists, but could be others--- dissidents, spies, even
journalists---whose behaviour threatens a government.

One danger is that drone use might undermine the normative prohibition
on the assassination of leaders and government officials that most (but
not all) states currently respect. A greater danger, however, is that
the US will have normalized murder as a tool of statecraft and created a
world where states can increasingly take vengeance on individuals
outside their borders without the niceties of extradition, due process
or trial.146 As some of its critics have noted, the Obama administration
may have created a world where states will find it easier to kill
terrorists rather than capture them and deal with all of the legal and
evidentiary difficulties associated with giving them a fair trial.147

Fourth, there is a distinct danger that the world will divide into two
camps: developed states in possession of drone technology, and weak
states and rebel movements that lack them. States with recurring
separatist or insurgent problems may begin to police their restive
territories through drone strikes, essentially containing the problem in
a fixed geographical region and engaging in a largely punitive policy
against them. [One could easily imagine that
**[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for example, [might resort to drone
strikes in Uighur provinces in order to keep potential
threats]{.underline} [from emerging, or that **[Russia]{.mark}** could
use drones to strike at separatist movements]{.underline} [in
Chechnya]{.underline} or elsewhere. Such behaviour would not necessarily
be confined to authoritarian governments; it is equally possible that
[[**Israel** might use drones]{.mark} to police Gaza and the West Bank,
thus reducing the vulnerability of Israeli soldiers]{.underline} to
Palestinian attacks on the ground. The extent to which Israel might be
willing to use drones in combat and surveillance was revealed in its
November 2012 attack on Gaza. Israel allegedly used a drone to
assassinate the Hamas leader Ahmed Jabari and employed a number of armed
drones for strikes in a way that was described as 'unprecedented' by
senior Israeli officials.148 It is not hard to imagine Israel concluding
that drones over Gaza were the best way to deal with the problem of
Hamas, even if their use left the Palestinian population subject to
constant, unnerving surveillance. All of the consequences of such a
sharp division between the haves and have-nots with drone technology is
hard to assess, but one possibility is that [governments with
**secessionist movements** might be less willing to negotiate and grant
concessions if drones allowed them to police their **internal enemies**
with **ruthless efficiency** and 'manage' the problem at low
cost]{.underline}. The result might be a situation where such conflicts
are contained but not resolved, while citizens in developed states grow
increasingly indifferent to the suffering of those making secessionist
or even national liberation claims, including just ones, upon them.

Finally, drones have the capacity to strengthen the surveillance
capacity of both democracies and authoritarian regimes, with significant
consequences for civil liberties. In the UK, BAE Systems is adapting
military-designed drones for a range of civilian policing tasks
including 'monitoring antisocial motorists, protesters, agricultural
thieves and fly-tippers'.149 Such drones are also envisioned as
monitoring Britain's shores for illegal immigration and drug smuggling.
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued
61 permits for domestic drone use between November 2006 and June 2011,
mainly to local and state police, but also to federal agencies and even
universities.150 According to one FAA estimate, the US will have 30,000
drones patrolling the skies by 2022.151 Similarly, the European
Commission will spend US\$260 million on Eurosur, a new programme that
will use drones to patrol the Mediterranean coast.152 The risk that
drones will turn democracies into 'surveillance states' is well known,
but the risks for authoritarian regimes may be even more severe.
Authoritarian states, particularly those that face serious internal
opposition, may tap into drone technology now available to monitor and
ruthlessly punish their opponents. In semi-authoritarian Russia, for
example, drones have already been employed to monitor pro-democracy
protesters.153 One could only imagine what a truly murderous
authoritarian regime---such as Bashar al-Assad's Syria---would do with
its own fleet of drones. The expansion of drone technology may make the
strong even stronger, thus tilting the balance of power in authoritarian
regimes even more decisively towards those who wield the coercive
instruments of power and against those who dare to challenge them.

Conclusion

Even though it has now been confronted with blowback from drones in the
failed Times Square bombing, the United States has yet to engage in a
serious analysis of the strategic costs and consequences of its use of
drones, both for its own security and for the rest of the world. [Much
of the debate over drones]{.underline} to date has focused on measuring
body counts and carries the unspoken assumption that if drone strikes
are efficient---that is, low cost and low risk for US personnel relative
to the terrorists killed---then they must also be effective. This
article has argued that such analyses are operating with an attenuated
notion of effectiveness that [discounts]{.underline} some of the other
key dynamics---such as the corrosion of the perceived competence and
legitimacy of governments where drone strikes take place, [**growing
anti-Americanism** and fresh recruitment to militant
networks]{.underline}---[that reveal the costs of **drone
warfare**]{.underline}. In other words, [the analysis]{.underline} of
the effectiveness of drones [takes into account only the 'loss' side of
the ledger for the 'bad guys', without asking what America's enemies
gain]{.underline} by being subjected to a policy of constant
surveillance and attack.

In his second term, President Obama has an opportunity to reverse course
and establish a new drones policy which mitigates these costs and avoids
some of the long-term consequences that flow from them. [[A]{.mark} more
[sensible]{.mark} US [approach would **impose**]{.mark} **some
[limits]{.mark}**]{.underline} on drone use in order to minimize the
political costs and long-term strategic consequences. One step might be
to limit the use of drones to HVTs, such as leading political and
operational figures for terrorist networks, while reducing or
eliminating the strikes against the 'foot soldiers' or other Islamist
networks not related to Al-Qaeda. This approach would reduce the number
of strikes and civilian deaths associated with drones while reserving
their use for those targets that pose a direct or imminent threat to the
security of the United States.

Such a self-limiting approach to drones might also minimize the degree
of political opposition that US drone strikes generate in states such as
Pakistan and Yemen, as their leaders, and even the civilian population,
often tolerate or even approve of strikes against HVTs. Another step
might be to improve the levels of transparency of the drone programme.
At present, there are no publicly articulated guidelines stipulating who
can be killed by a drone and who cannot, and no data on drone strikes
are released to the public.154 Even a Department of Justice memorandum
which authorized the Obama administration to kill Anwar al-Awlaki, an
American citizen, remains classified.155 Such non-transparency fuels
suspicions that the US is indifferent to the civilian casualties caused
by drone strikes, a perception which in turn magnifies the deleterious
political consequences of the strikes. Letting some sunlight in on the
drones programme would not eliminate all of the opposition to it, but it
would go some way towards undercutting the worst conspiracy theories
about drone use in these countries while also signalling that the US
government holds itself legally and morally accountable for its
behaviour.156

[A]{.underline} final, and [**crucial, step**]{.underline} towards
mitigating the strategic consequences of drones [would be [to develop
**international**]{.mark}**ly recognized [standards]{.mark}** and
**norms**]{.underline} for their use and sale. [It is not realistic to
suggest that the US stop using its drones altogether, or to assume that
other countries will accept a moratorium on buying and using
drones.]{.underline} [**The genie is out of the bottle**: drones will be
a fact of life for years to come. What remains to be done is [to
ensure]{.mark} that their [use]{.mark}]{.underline} and sale
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} transparent,
**[[regulated]{.underline}]{.mark}** and consistent with internationally
recognized human rights standards. The Obama administration has already
begun to show some awareness that drones are dangerous if placed in the
wrong hands. A recent New York Times report revealed that the Obama
administration began to develop a secret drones 'rulebook' to govern
their use if Mitt Romney were to be elected president.157

The same logic operates on the international level. Lethal drones will
eventually be in the hands of those who will use them with fewer
scruples than President Obama has. Without a set of internationally
recognized standards or norms governing their sale and use, drones will
proliferate without control, be misused by governments and non-state
actors, and become an instrument of repression for the strong. One
remedy might be an international convention on the sale and use of
drones which could establish guidelines and norms for their use, perhaps
along the lines of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW)
treaty, which attempted to spell out rules on the use of incendiary
devices and fragment-based weapons.158 While enforcement of these
guidelines and adherence to rules on their use will be imperfect and
marked by derogations, exceptions and violations, the presence of a
convention may reinforce norms against the flagrant misuse of drones and
induce more restraint in their use than might otherwise be seen.
Similarly, a UN investigatory body on drones would help to hold states
accountable for their use of drones and begin to build a gradual
consensus on the types of activities for which drones can, and cannot,
be used.159 As the progenitor and leading user of drone technology, [the
[US]{.mark} now [has]{.mark} an **[opportun]{.mark}ity to show
[leadership]{.mark}** in developing an international legal architecture
which might avert]{.underline} some of [the worst
consequences]{.underline} of their use.

oft-quoted **[[Youngstown]{.underline}]{.mark}** concurrence.[25](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/transcending-the-youngstown-triptych#_ftnref25)

The surface elegance of that concurring opinion contributed to its
mesmerizing appeal. But despite its rhetorical power and seemingly clear
categorical lines, the [Youngstown]{.underline} framework actually
[[provides]{.underline}]{.mark} precious [[**little guidance**

[[cases]{.mark}: those involving executive action in the **absence**

What's more, the Youngstown framework finds no place at all for
significant dimensions of the separation-of-powers picture that are
orthogonal to, and often absent from, the customary two-dimensional
matrix of executive versus congressional powers, including such vexing
and currently salient issues as the scope of prosecutorial discretion
and federal power vis-à-vis the States, as well as transcendent concerns
about individual rights. [[In **neglecting**]{.mark} such [issues, the

**defining** and [**policing** the]{.mark} intricate [structure]{.mark}
of government established by the Constitution]{.underline}---a structure
that must be preserved both to enable effective and politically
accountable policymaking and to protect individual liberty.

I. The Problem of Congressional Silence

Even on its face, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly [sacrosanct
[triptych is]{.mark} **deeply [ambiguous]{.mark}** [on the]{.mark} **key
question** of [**what to make** of **congressional

us that in category two---where there is an "absence of either a
congressional grant or denial of authority"---the President "can only
rely upon his own independent
powers."[26](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/transcending-the-youngstown-triptych#_ftnref26) Yet
in the very next breath Jackson's concurrence undercuts this pivotal
assertion, insisting instead that "congressional inertia, indifference
or quiescence may sometimes . . . enable, if not invite, measures of
independent presidential
responsibility."[27](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/transcending-the-youngstown-triptych#_ftnref27)

The truth is that [Youngstown offers **no**]{.underline} meaningful
[**baseline** against which to assess the]{.underline} operative
[**legal significance** of Congress's
silence]{.underline}.[28](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/transcending-the-youngstown-triptych#_ftnref28) [Nothing
in Youngstown]{.underline}, including Jackson's classic concurrence,
[sets out a normative **framework** for deciding: (1) which kinds
of]{.underline} presidential [action]{.underline} in the relevant sphere
[are **void**]{.underline} unless plainly authorized by Congress ex

Congress ex ante; and [(3) which are of **uncertain**
validity]{.underline} when Congress has been essentially "silent" on the
matter although dropping hints about its supposed "will." Nor does the
canonical Jackson concurrence speak to [(4) what
considerations]{.underline} should **[guide]{.underline}** the
[**resolution** of cases]{.underline} within this uncertain third
category.

[[In saying]{.mark} **virtually [nothing]{.mark}** about
the]{.underline} appropriate [framework for evaluating **presidential

axis---and instead charting presidential power only along

[Instead]{.underline} of formulating a tripartite scheme for mapping
exercises of presidential authority against the backdrop of what it

at least [[have **begun**]{.mark} **the [process]{.mark}** of

[Under our constitutional system]{.underline} --- as scholars left,

[acknowledged]{.mark}]{.underline} "the [**[legally binding]{.mark}

judgment with which they **disagreed**]{.underline}]{.mark}."9 A long
list of scholars across the ideological spectrum, including those who
take an extremely broad view of the powers of the President, have
recognized that the President has a "duty to enforce judgments." 10
"[When the [judiciary]{.mark} issues a judgment]{.underline}, others
[must regard it as [the **final disposition**]{.mark} of a

an adjunct of the executive branch. Instead of the three-branch system
of government created by the Constitution, we would have in effect a
two-branch system, with the executive serving as both prosecutor and
court of last resort."14 [[In place of the rule of

First, his bracing opening:

Why have honest and decent people who happen to be conservative
Republicans assented to laws that promise to make elections prone to
political manipulation? Why are Democrats bickering among themselves
when they need to pass some safeguards for our electoral process? And to
make sure that government is seen to work for the people and not just
for the plutocrats?

Second, Kagan\'s frightening historical analogy:

> [[As has]{.underline}]{.mark} so [often [been the case in other

We forget that German President Paul von Hindenburg thought he would be
able to control Adolph **[[Hitler]{.underline}]{.mark}** once he named
him chancellor in 1933. We forget that there was no \"March on Rome\" by
**[[Mussolini]{.underline}]{.mark}**\'s black shirts in 1922: The thugs
gathered outside the city and could have been stopped by the army. The
fascist leader got to Rome by train and King Victor Emmanuel III invited
him to form a government. Later, the myth of the March on Rome was
created. The acquiescence of the Western liberal democracies to the
rearmament of Germany is too well-known to need repeating and has
forever turned an otherwise useful word, appeasement, into a derisive
and foul concept.

For those of us who have opposed Donald Trump from the start, the third
most important thing Kagan writes has to do with Trump\'s supporters and
true American exceptionalism. He writes:

> Most Trump supporters are good parents, good neighbors and solid
> members of their communities. Their bigotry, for the most part, is
> typical white American bigotry, perhaps with an added measure of

Liberal democracy takes work. The National Education Association
published a report in 2017 on the decline in civics education over the
years, a decline that has cost us dearly. The professionalization of
political campaigns, beginning in the 1970s, has severed elections from
governance in a way they were not before, leading to cynicism and
accelerating polarization. Neoliberalism sent blue collar jobs overseas,
and neither party found the will to do much about it, leaving large
swaths of working poor feeling disconnected from the political process
altogether, ripe targets for an authoritarian.

At a Sept. 27 webinar co-sponsored by Boston University\'s Global
Development Policy Center and the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, Damon Silvers, policy director at the AFL-CIO, spoke about
the neoliberal trade ideology, saying its \"fundamental feature was a
race to the bottom on wages.\" He said:

> What the Biden worker-centered approach really is is a return to the
> philosophy that animated the post-war settlement and the Bretton Woods
> agreements --- the idea that international economic structures and
> policies must have democratic legitimacy, they must support
> broad-based global economic growth, and most of all they must support
> rising real wages.

Then came a warning akin to Kagan\'s:

> The [[events of **recent years**]{.mark} should
> [make]{.mark}]{.underline} it **[very [clear]{.mark}]{.underline}**
> that [[the alternative to]{.underline}]{.mark} President [[Biden\'s
> approach is]{.mark} not]{.underline} a [return to]{.underline} the
> neoliberal mythology of [the 1990s]{.underline}. Plan B is not the
> 1990s. Plan B [is [the]{.mark} 19[30s]{.mark}]{.underline} --- the
> [[rise of authoritarianism inside]{.mark} the [world\'s **major
> economies**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and strife among
> them]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[stakes]{.mark} could **[scarcely be higher]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and the principal responsibility for saving the country from a Trumpian
future lies with Republican leaders. They have policy differences with
President Joe Biden and the Democrats, but American democracy has always
allowed for the adjudication of policy differences. [This is not about
policy]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} about [the [prospect of]{.mark} a
[**fascist takeover** and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[end of]{.mark}
**liberal [democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Kagan writes:

[understanding of its far-reaching responsibilities]{.underline}, and a
new worldwide campaign [to promote democratic values]{.underline},
media, and civic institutions.

Part of that, I argue, must involve a serious attack on the soft
underbelly of these autocracies: kleptocracy. The money being looted
from public coffers in corrupt autocracies is not only sustaining
abusive rulers; it is also being laundered into the banking and property
systems of the world's democracies, corroding our own rule of law and
undermining our will to confront the spread of despotism. We can be the
kleptocrats' foes or their bankers, but not both. By fighting
kleptocracy and money laundering, we can help reverse authoritarian
trends both at home and abroad. But as the old saying goes, you can't
beat something with nothing.

We cannot defend and renew free government around the world unless we do
so at home. Stopping the desecration of democratic norms and
institutions by Donald Trump (and budding autocrats elsewhere) is vital
but insufficient. The [[decline of]{.mark} **American
[democracy]{.mark}** [did not begin with Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
it will not end with his departure from the White House. Our republic's
sickness has its roots in decades of rising political polarization that
has turned our two parties into something akin to warring tribes,
willing to skirt bedrock principles of fairness and inclusion for pure
partisan advantage.

America's constitutional order has long been scarred by racism, deep
injustices in our criminal justice system, and the soft corruption of
our systems of lobbying and campaign finance. Now these deep-rooted
problems are quickening in a society that has forgotten the purpose of
civic education and is increasingly in thrall to social media, which
privileges the profits of sensationalism and groupthink above the
prophets of facts and evidence-based debate. None of this is a cry of
despair; all of it is a call to arms. As I explain in this book's final
chapters, it doesn't have to go on like this. [[Promising]{.mark} and
**viable [reforms]{.mark}** [are available]{.mark}. We can improve,
empower, and heal]{.underline} our [democracy]{.underline} --- and much
can be done [[even while Trump is in power]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can
change this. We --- democratic societies --- must change this. But this
effort starts with each of us as an individual.

#### Democracy solves [every]{.underline} existential threat.

The Soviet Union was an existential threat, and this focused the
attention of the world, and the American people. There [[existential
threat today is]{.underline}]{.mark} not found on a map, but it is
[[very real]{.underline}]{.mark}. The forces of the past are making
steady progress against the modern world order. **[[Terrorist]{.mark}
movement[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Middle East,
[**[extremist]{.mark} partie[s]{.mark}** [across
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} a paranoid tyrant in
[[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline} threatening [[nuclear
blackmail]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, at the center of the web, an
aggressive KGB [dictator in [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. They all want
to turn the world back to a dark past because their survival is
threatened by the values of the free world, epitomized by the United
States. And [they are [thriving as the U.S.]{.mark} has
[retreated]{.mark}]{.underline}. The global freedom index has declined
for ten consecutive years. No one like to talk about the United States
as a global policeman, but this is what happens when there is no cop on
the beat. [American [leadership **begins at home**]{.mark}]{.underline},
right here. [[America cannot lead the world on
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} and human rights [[if there is no
unity]{.mark} on the meaning and importance of these things.
[Leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} is [**[required]{.mark}** to make that
case]{.underline} clearly and powerfully. Right now, Americans are
engaged in politics at a level not seen in decades. It is an opportunity
for them to rediscover that making America great begins with believing
America can be great.

The Cold War was won on [[American values]{.underline}]{.mark} that were
shared by both parties and nearly every American. Institutions that were
created by a Democrat, Truman, were triumphant forty years later thanks
to the courage of a Republican, Reagan. This bipartisan consistency
[[created]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[decades of]{.mark} **strategic
[stability]{.mark}** that is the **great strength** of
democracies]{.underline}. Strong institutions that outlast politicians
allow for long-range planning. In contrast, dictators can operate only
tactically, not strategically, because they are not constrained by the
balance of powers, but cannot afford to think beyond their own survival.
This is why a dictator like [Putin has an **advantage in
chaos**]{.underline}, the [ability to move quickly]{.underline}. This
can only be met by strategy, by long-term goals that are based on shared
values, not on polls and cable news.

The fear of making things worse has ~~paralyzed~~ \[prevented\] the
United States from trying to make things better. There will always be
setbacks, but the United States cannot quit. The spread of [[democracy
is the only]{.mark} **proven [remedy]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline}
nearly [**[every crisis]{.mark}** that plagues the world today. [War,
famine, poverty, terrorism]{.mark} --- all [are generated and
exacerbated by **authoritarian regimes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A policy
of America First inevitably puts American security last.

According to Kemmelmeier, the [[virus']{.mark} **rapid [spread]{.mark}**
[occurred]{.mark}]{.underline} very early on [[due
to]{.underline}]{.mark} two key ingredients: high mobility and an
[[authoritarian government]{.underline}]{.mark}. "In a highly mobile
society with a modern transportation system, people can come and go very
quickly," he said. "An [[outbreak in]{.underline}]{.mark} such a
[[society]{.underline}]{.mark} coupled [[with]{.mark} a
[government]{.mark}]{.underline} that is [**mainly [interested]{.mark}**
[in suppressing, rather than addressing]{.mark}, the problem [is
a]{.mark} **recipe for [disaster]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

Meanwhile, back in the United States, the government's handling of
COVID-19 has been uneven --- prompting some unfavorable comparisons with
other governments' approaches. Yet, over time, [[democratic
societies]{.underline}]{.mark} appear to be [[**more effective** than
authoritarian]{.mark} cultures [in dealing with **major
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[include **disease**]{.mark}
**epidemics**]{.underline}. The finding is from a recent study by
Kemmelmeier and social psychology doctoral student Kodai Kusano,
completed prior to the pandemic. It was recently published in the
journal Royal Society Open Science.

"I want to give some hope," Kemmelmeier said. "Whatever we think about
America at this moment, as a species, the 'killer app' (key attribute)
for humans is cooperation. In times of crisis, cooperation increases.
[[Freedoms]{.underline}]{.mark} are always [[related to]{.mark} our
ability to [cooperate]{.mark}]{.underline}. It turns out [[when people
**cooperate**]{.mark} **on a voluntary basis**,
[they're]{.mark}]{.underline} actually [**really, really [good]{.mark}**
[at reducing]{.mark} the [threat]{.mark}]{.underline} from pandemics and
from pathogens more generally."

Kemmelmeier sees light at the end of the tunnel. "It's something hopeful
--- in the long term, this is good news for us," he said. "We're in the
middle of it, and it's messy. That's part of democracy. Democracies over
the long haul --- even with politics and division --- to the extent they
can foster trust in institutions, can be highly successful at addressing
outbreaks."

Kusano and Kemmelmeier [analyzed]{.underline} the [relationship between
[democracy]{.mark} and environment]{.underline}, and [how societies
[adapt to]{.mark} a variety of [**ecological threats**,
including]{.mark}]{.underline} viruses and other
[[disease]{.underline}]{.mark} agents known collectively as pathogens.
To examine these dynamics, [they [created]{.mark}]{.underline} arguably
[[the **largest data set ever assembled**]{.mark}, analyzing data from
1949-2016]{.underline}. They found that democracies both shape and are
shaped by ecological factors in ways not previously understood.

The researchers looked at three factors in measuring democracy, in
essence a society's level of self-determination. They used these three
components to represent a range of many relevant indicators of
democracy: The electoral component --- the extent to which citizens
achieve democratic election free from irregularities such as bribery The
liberal component --- the extent to which citizens' political activities
are protected by civil liberties The participatory component --- the
extent to which citizens actively participate in all parts of the
political processes. Kusano and Kemmelmeier's findings are reflected in
this overview of pathogen prevalence as an influencing factor on
democracy, and vice versa:

High Pathogen → Low Democracy: The study's findings suggest that
pathogen prevalence impedes the development of a liberal democracy.
During an outbreak, survival depends on people banding together --- even
if that means being unified separately while practicing today's social
distancing. Those with common bonds or interests stick together, while
others may feel like or be seen as outsiders. Personal freedoms may be
restricted.

Low Pathogen → High Democracy: A low prevalence of pathogens facilitates
higher levels of democracy. A greater mix between groups across the
social landscape is the norm because survival isn't in the balance. When
ecological pressures (including from pathogens) are low, there is much
less of a need for social conformity. Individual freedoms can be high,
as people decide by themselves what they want.

[**High [Democracy]{.mark}** [→ Low Pathogen]{.mark}]{.underline}: The
[[data]{.mark} **clearly [show]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
[[functioning]{.underline}]{.mark} (high)
[[democracies]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[better at reducing **pathogen
prevalence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, high level
democracies precede and lead to low pathogen prevalence. [Democracies
are **accountable**]{.underline}, as people are rewarded for identifying
problems (a pat on the back, public recognition, a Pulitzer, for
example).

[Low Democracy → High Pathogen: Low]{.underline} (less functioning)
[democracies]{.underline} are [**less effective** at reducing pathogen
prevalence]{.underline}. The [findings are **very clear**]{.underline}
in this regard: [Countries with]{.underline} a high level of
[democratization]{.underline} are [likely to see a **greater reduction**
of pathogens in the future]{.underline}, compared to countries with a
lower level of democratization. Those living under authoritarian rule
are generally powerless to hold the government accountable. Pointing out
problems is not rewarded, while societal ills are suppressed.

[[Accountability is]{.mark} a **[key]{.mark} factor**]{.underline}.
"Essentially, [democratic societies]{.underline}, which tend to
emphasize individual rights, [are]{.underline} actually
[better]{.underline} over the long haul [at dealing with]{.underline}
these kinds of [threats]{.underline}," Kemmelmeier said.
"[Democratically]{.underline} elected [governments are
accountable]{.underline} to the people. [[That is]{.underline}]{.mark}
always going to be [[the vulnerability of **every authoritarian
regime**]{.underline}]{.mark}, because they're not accountable. [They're
not]{.underline} necessarily [doing]{.underline} the
[prevention]{.underline}; they are not necessarily [building **national
capacity** to respond to disasters]{.underline}. And they don't reward
people for sniffing out the problems."

In the wake of a major crisis, public officials are more accountable
through elections and other facets of democracies. "I don't think
there's any politician who, in future pandemics, can say, 'This is not a
problem; there are just a few cases, and they're going to go away by
themselves,'" Kemmelmeier said. "Those days are gone because now it's
part of the political agenda and in everybody's thinking, at least in
our generation. Now, our kids' generation will have to prove that they
at least thought about the gravity of the situation."

While there's no predicting when the next disaster or pathogen event
will occur, Kusano and Kemmelmeier's research found that
**[[democratic]{.mark} cultures]{.underline}** over time [[learn from
one disaster and]{.mark} are **better [prepared]{.mark}** [for the
next]{.mark}]{.underline} one --- [with [casualties for future
events]{.mark} **dramatically [reduced]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

"In a more authoritarian society, however, in which the idea is 'OK, get
over this,' nothing changes, and you suffer from this," Kemmelmeier
said. "The next time \[in an **[[authoritarian
culture]{.underline}]{.mark}**\], you may [[have]{.mark} a
[higher]{.mark} level of [casualties]{.mark}]{.underline}. This means
you will have a [[lower]{.mark} workforce, lower
[productivity]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's not only people and lives for
the humanitarian reasons that [these [societies
suffer]{.mark}]{.underline}, but also [[for **economic
reasons**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

In the long term, the [[study suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[democracies' **effectiveness** in mitigating **major
threats**]{.underline}]{.mark} reduces stresses on their citizens, which
can strengthen democracy. "Democracies continuously build the basis of
their existence," he said. "They need to prove that they can deal with
the problems that people face. This means that democracy, when
effective, can spread. But even democracies can fail if they're corrupt
or ineffective."

According to Kemmelmeier, [[trust]{.underline}]{.mark} is [another
[attribute of democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}, one that [[translates
a]{.mark} **dangerous [situation]{.mark}** [into]{.mark} a
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}. "In a democracy, there is actually a
fairly high level of trust," he said. "People who are under siege tend
to trust the institution, for things that institutions do for them that
people can't do for themselves. During a crisis, [[people trust]{.mark}
**democratic [institutions]{.mark}** [to keep their]{.mark} **best
[interests]{.mark}** [in mind, so]{.mark}]{.underline} when the order
comes out from the government, [[everybody falls in
line]{.underline}]{.mark}."

How does Kemmelmeier view the United States' battle to control the
coronavirus' spread? "The big problem right now is there are so many
different voices," he said. "But it's not unusual. Democracy is always
messy --- that's what makes democracies. The results depend primarily on
leaders and their leadership in uniting the country. This is always an
opportunity for leaders to bring people together. But leadership in a
crisis is always risky."

Which circles back to trust. "Democratic governments," he said, "must
not only have competent technocrats such as CDC and FEMA; they must
trust them to handle the crisis, and they must also ensure that the
public trusts them." While the recent study covered nearly 70 years of
world history, [rarely]{.underline} has there been [a **more [crucial
moment]{.mark}** for nations [to demonstrate
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline} than right now.

[[weaken]{.mark} international alliances and **[multilateral]{.mark}

populists in nuclear-armed states, including some of the five
nuclear-weapon states recognized under the 1968 Treaty on the
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, [shatters]{.underline} [the
**presumed distinction** between responsible and irresponsible nuclear
powers]{.underline} and complicates attempts to heal rifts in the
international order. Policies to wait out populists or to balance their
influence in multilateral institutions seem to have had limited success.
A sustainable strategy to deal with the challenge posed by populists
would need to start by recognizing that [we can no longer
assume]{.underline} that [nuclear weapons are safe in the hands
of]{.underline} some [states]{.underline} but not in others'.

Introduction

The rise of nationalist populists1 to power in nuclear-armed states and
their allies is undermining the nuclear order and raising the risks of
nuclear war. That populists such as Boris
[[Johnson]{.underline}]{.mark}, Narendra [[Modi]{.underline}]{.mark},
Vladimir [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} were able to [take [charge]{.mark} of
**nuclear [arsenals]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including in some of the
nuclear powers recognized under the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), challenges the assumption that established
nuclear-weapon states behave responsibly. Nationalist populism,2
understood as a nationalist, anti-elitist, illiberal, and anti-pluralist
set of ideas and politics conducted in the supposed interests of "the
people" --- that is, the domestic constituencies of the
nationalist-populist leaders---has been on the rise globally since the
mid-2000s. It has come to include the leadership of a growing number of
countries3 and has begun to influence the effectiveness of time-honored
institutions of the nuclear order.

We argue that this rise of nationalist populists and their foreign and
defense policies weakens the nuclear order in novel, significant, and
persistent ways. Three [characteristics]{.underline} are [typical of
nationalist populists' nuclear policies]{.underline}: they [[talk
differently]{.mark} about nuclear weapons]{.underline}; they
[have]{.underline} a [specific way of getting [involved in]{.mark}
national [decision making]{.mark}]{.underline} on nuclear-weapon issues;
[and]{.underline} their [approach to international
alliances]{.underline} and institutions is [unique]{.underline}. The
fact that nationalist-populist leaders have assumed control over nuclear
weapons in countries at the core of the nuclear order
[[shatters]{.underline}]{.mark} the presumed [distinction
between]{.underline} "**[[responsible]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[and]{.underline} "**[irresponsible]{.underline}**" **[nuclear
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These [leaders threaten]{.underline} the
[[nuclear order built on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**principled
acceptance** of]{.underline} a logic of [[restraint]{.mark} by the
nuclear-weapon states]{.underline}.

The interpretation of the statute is aided by the synopsis to a recent
amendment to Section 2825. This synopsis states that the
[[amendment]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[[clarifies]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[**limitations** on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[public use of the word
engineering]{.underline}]{.mark} by those not authorized to practice
engineering for the general public.\" 68 Del.Laws, c. 24 (emphasis

those not certified, [[it would have been]{.mark} more
[logical]{.mark}]{.underline} for it [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[used the word]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"**[[prohibition]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" (or the equivalent) [[rather
than]{.underline}]{.mark} the word
\"**[[limitations]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" in the synopsis.\[7\] Section
2825 must be analyzed, therefore, with the understanding that it bans
only uses of the term \"engineer\" which would \"lead to the 18\*18
belief that such person is entitled to practice eng.ineering\" --- i.e.,
a misleading use of any derivative of the word \"engineer.\"

[[**Prohibited** subsidies]{.underline}]{.mark}, as described in Article
3 of the SCM Agreement, [[are **disallowed
outright**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and WTO members can unilaterally impose
countervailing measures against the country sponsoring them. This
category \[\*146\] includes (i) subsidies that are contingent, in law
237or in fact 238upon export performance 239and (ii) subsidies that are
contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods.

Export contingency can be \"de jure\" or \"de facto.\" De jure export
contingency derives from \"the very words of the relevant legislation,
regulation\[,\] or other legal instrument constituting the measure.\"
240De facto export contingency is met when \"the facts demonstrate that
the granting of a subsidy \... is in fact tied to actual or anticipated
exportation or export earnings.\" 241The WTO jurisprudence regarding
\"de facto\" contingency, however, is not uniform and WTO panels have
set forth various alternative tests. In Australia-Automotive Leather II,
the Panel established a standard of \"close connection\" between the
grant of a subsidy and export performance. 242In Canada-Aircraft, the
Panel and the Appellate Body (\"AB\") implemented the so called but-for
test, which interprets the \"tied to\" language to be equivalent to a
relationship of \"conditionality\" between the grant of a subsidy and
export performance. 243Therefore, de facto contingency is met when \"the
facts demonstrate that the tax benefit would not have been granted \...
but for anticipated exportation or export earnings.\" 244In the same
case, the AB clarified that \"it does not suffice to demonstrate solely
that a government granting a subsidy anticipated that exports would
result.\" 245This means that, in the AB\'s view, the granting
authority\'s expectations on exports may not be sufficient to meet the
standard, so the subsidy must be objectively contingent upon export
\[\*147\] performance. 246In pursuit of a more objective criteria, the
AB suggested that, \"where relevant evidence exists, the assessment
could be based on a comparison between, on the one hand, the ratio of
anticipated export and domestic sales of the subsidized product \... and
on the other hand, the situation in the absence of the subsidy.\" 247But
both the Panel and AB further clarified that an assessment based on
ratios is incapable by itself of establishing that a given subsidy is de
facto contingent on export performance \"in the absence of any
meaningful analysis regarding how a subsidy\'s design and structure
contributes to the presence of an incentive for a recipient to \[favor\]
export sales over domestic sales.\" 248

With respect to domestic use contingency, Article 3.1(b) contains no
reference to contingency in law or in fact. Nevertheless, the AB has
found that Article 3.1(b)\'s scope covers both de jure and de facto
contingency. 249Also, both the Panel and the AB have concluded that the
general guidance regarding evaluations of de facto export contingency
should be applicable to de facto domestic use contingency. Finally, it
should be mentioned that the Panel and AB decisions are not binding
precedential authority but rather can be only strongly persuasive
authority. Therefore, countries should be aware of all these alternative
tests when designing their tax policies, as there is no certainty as to
which criteria WTO decision makers may apply in the event of a dispute
(e.g. but-for test, close connection test, assessments based on ratios,
etc.).

A [[subsidy that is not]{.underline}]{.mark} considered
\"**[[prohibited]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" [[can still
satisfy]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**specificity criteria** and
become]{.mark} an **[actionable]{.mark} subsidy**]{.underline} if it
meets the two following requirements:

> \(1\) Specificity: an actionable subsidy is considered specific when
> the eligibility to receive the benefits is limited to certain
> enterprises, industries, or areas; 250and
>
> \(2\) Adverse effect: an actionable subsidy is considered adverse when
> it produces a serious prejudice to the interests of another member, an
> injury to its domestic industry, or a nullification or impairment of
> benefits accruing directly or indirectly to other members under the
> GATT. 251

#### "Prohibitions" must be an [across the board]{.underline} ban\-\--bans with exceptions are "regulations." 

Justice **White 87**, California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480
US 202, Supreme Court, 1987

Following its earlier decision in Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of
Mission Indians, San Diego County, Cal. v. Duffy, 694 F. 2d 1185 (1982),
cert. denied, 461 U. S. 929 (1983), which also involved the
applicability of § 326.5 of the California Penal Code to Indian
reservations, the Court of Appeals rejected this submission. 783 F. 2d,
at 901-903. In Barona, applying what it thought to be the civil/criminal
dichotomy drawn in Bryan v. Itasca County, [[the Court]{.mark} of
Appeals [drew a distinction]{.mark} [between]{.mark} state
\"criminal/[prohibitory]{.mark}\" [laws]{.mark} and state
\"civil/[regulatory\" laws]{.mark}]{.underline}: if [the intent of a
state law is generally to prohibit certain conduct,]{.underline} it
falls within Pub. L. 280\'s grant of criminal jurisdiction, but [[if
the]{.mark} state [law]{.mark} generally [permits the conduct]{.mark} at
issue, [subject to regulation, it must be classified a]{.mark}s
civil/[regulatory]{.mark}]{.underline} and Pub. L. 280 does not
authorize its enforcement on an Indian reservation. The shorthand test
is whether the conduct at issue violates the State\'s public policy.
[Inquiring into the nature of § 326.5, the Court of Appeals held that it
was regulatory rather than prohibitory]{.underline}.\[8\] This was the
analysis employed, with similar results, 210\*210 by the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Seminole Tribe of Florida v.
Butterworth, 658 F. 2d 310 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 1020 (1982),
which the Ninth Circuit found persuasive.\[9\]

We are persuaded that [the prohibitory/regulatory distinction is
consistent with Bryan\'s construction]{.underline} of Pub. L. 280. It is
not a bright-line rule, however; and as the Ninth Circuit itself
observed, an argument of some weight may be made that the bingo statute
is prohibitory rather than regulatory. But in the present case, the
court reexamined the state law and reaffirmed its holding in Barona, and
we are reluctant to disagree with that court\'s view of the nature and
intent of the state law at issue here.

There is surely a fair basis for its conclusion. [[California does not

[[These views are]{.mark} **widely [shared]{.mark}** today [by]{.mark}

conservatives who are some of the strongest advocates of presidential

For example, Professor Stephen Calabresi---co-founder of the Federalist
Society, widely considered the nation\'s most influential conservative
legal organization---has written that a system in which the President
held an effective veto over court judgments \"would be not so much a
system of constitutional government as it would be a system of rule by
an elected Napoleonic strongman.\"

Just last month, in Gamble v. United States, Justice Clarence
Thomas---the Court\'s die-hard, rock-ribbed conservative

\"\[C\]onsistent with the nature of the \'judicial Power,\' the federal

Abraham Lincoln detested the Supreme Court\'s ruling in Dred Scott v.

recognized, to invest the President with tyrannical powers.

Summing Up: The Effectiveness of Implementation

We know far too little to make confident judgments about how well judges
and administrators carry out Supreme Court decisions, even if that
question is simplified to the question of compliance and noncompliance.
Still, a few generalizations are possible.

When judges and [[administrators]{.underline}]{.mark} address issues on
which the Supreme Court has ruled, most of the time they [**readily
[apply]{.mark}** [the Court's ruling]{.mark}. They]{.underline} often
[do so [**even when** that]{.mark} requires them to [**depart** from
positions]{.mark} on legal policy they had [adopted **before** the
Court]{.mark}'s decision. [These]{.mark} actions]{.underline} typically
[[get **little attention** because]{.mark} they accord with]{.underline}
most people's [assumption that]{.underline} judges and
[[administrators]{.mark} will **[follow]{.mark} the Court's lead** [and
**carry**]{.mark} **out its [decisions fully]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Contrary to this assumption, however, implementation of the Court's
policies is often quite imperfect. For Supreme Court decisions, like
congressional statutes, the record of implementation is mixed. Some
Court rulings are carried out more effectively than others, and specific
decisions often are implemented better in some places or situations than
in others.

[Implementation]{.underline} of the Court's decisions [is **most
successful** in lower courts]{.underline}, especially appellate courts.
[When the Court announces a **new rule of law**, judges]{.underline}
generally [do their best to **follow its lead**]{.underline}. And when a
series of decisions indicates that the Court has changed its position in
a field of policy, lower courts tend to follow the new trend. For this
reason, Court decisions that require only action by lower courts tend to
be carried out more effectively than decisions that involve other
policymakers.36

But even appellate judges sometimes diverge from the Court's rulings.
Seldom do they explicitly refuse to follow the Court's decisions. More
common is what might be called implicit noncompliance, in which a court
purports to follow the Supreme Court's lead but actually evades the
implications of the Court's ruling.

The higher frequency of implementation problems for Supreme Court
decisions in the executive branch reflects several conditions. One
condition is that administrators are likely to feel less obligation to
follow the Court's lead than do judges. Another is that carrying out the
Court's decisions is more likely to create practical problems for
administrators. [Even so, [the Court enjoys]{.mark} **considerable
success** in getting **[compliance]{.mark}** from **administrative
bodies**]{.underline}.

Responses by Legislatures and Chief Executives

[[**Congress**, the **president**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[**[state]{.mark} counterparts** also **[respond]{.mark} regularly**
[to]{.mark} Supreme [Court decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their
responses shape the impact of the Court's decisions, and some responses
by Congress and the president affect the Court itself.

[The **Strength of the Norm** at the Federal Level]{.underline}

[[Since]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[civil rights]{.underline}]{.mark}
era, [federal [exec]{.mark}utive official[s]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[**consistently [complied]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} federal
**[court]{.mark} order[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.22 One of [the most
**instructive** examples is the]{.underline} George W. [[Bush]{.mark}
administration's **obedience**]{.underline} in the wake of the September
11 terrorist attacks. The [Bush]{.underline} administration
[[made]{.mark} **bold [claims]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the [**scope**
of]{.mark} **executive [authority]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the war on
terror---leading some scholars to worry that the administration might
not obey a judicial order restricting its power.23 [[Yet when
the]{.mark} **Supreme [Court]{.mark}** held]{.underline} that Guantanamo
Bay [detainees could file]{.underline} federal [habeas]{.underline}
corpus [petitions to [challenge]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[[confinement]{.underline}]{.mark},24 President [[Bush announced: "We'll
**abide**]{.mark} by the **Court's decision**. That doesn't mean
I]{.underline} have to [agree with it."]{.underline}25

Recent episodes, however, raise questions about the continuing adherence
to this convention. One cause for concern is President Trump's rhetoric
denouncing federal judges that interfere with his travel ban. Although
other presidents have criticized the judiciary, most have not mounted
seemingly personal attacks against specific judges.26 Another worrisome
sign is the pardon of former Arizona Sherriff Joe Arpaio. In 2016,
Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt for violating a federal court
order, which restricted his authority to arrest and detain undocumented
immigrants.27 On August 25, 2017, President Trump pardoned Arpaio28---a
move that could be seen as an endorsement of not only the sheriff's
aggressive law enforcement tactics but also his defiance of the federal
court.

Nevertheless, I believe [[there are]{.mark} **good [reasons]{.mark}**
[to expect]{.mark} **continued [compliance]{.mark}** by the executive
branch]{.underline}, at least for the foreseeable future. [**Several
[factors]{.mark}** serve to **[reinforce]{.mark}** the **convention**
requiring [**obedience** to **all**]{.mark} **federal [court]{.mark}
order[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The first is the fact that both
[**[Repub]{.mark}lican** [and **Dem**]{.mark}**ocratic**]{.underline}
presidential [[admin]{.mark}istration[s]{.mark} have **consistently
[complied]{.mark}** [from the]{.mark} **19[70s]{.mark} to the present
day**]{.underline}.29 [[That]{.mark} **historical [record]{.mark}**
[alone places]{.mark}]{.underline} some [**[pressure]{.mark}**

[[Zivotofsky]{.mark} II]{.underline} is a victory for presidential
foreign relations power. But it almost certainly **[[does not

is]{.underline} so is the **[[absence of]{.mark} a

[but other reasons include]{.underline} the
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**olitical **[[q]{.underline}]{.mark}**uestion
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**octrine (which despite Zivotofsky I is not
dead) and related **[[justiciability]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and
practical factors, including **[secrecy]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[ripeness]{.underline}**, jurisdictional limitations, [[and
more]{.underline}]{.mark}.132 [Judicial [review is
**unavailable**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for most]{.mark} of the
[instances]{.mark} in which Presidents arguably stretch or defy
**congressional authorizations**]{.underline}, or act contrary to
congressional restraints in diplomatic, intelligence, and military
affairs. [[Zivotofsky]{.mark} II [is unusual]{.mark}]{.underline} not

[[Even when]{.mark} foreign relations [clashes **reach the

internal logic [[will **not**]{.mark} **likely [have predictable
consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline} there. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
Supreme [[Court has **no**]{.mark} **institutional predilection in

[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [if anything [has shown a **tendency** to
**read it narrowly**]{.mark} in]{.underline} [the **foreign relations
context**]{.underline} in recent years.134 Especially in foreign
relations cases, as Zivotofsky II suggests, judicial outcomes and the
doctrines used to justify them are largely driven, as Justice Jackson
said in a narrower context, by "imperatives of events and contemporary
imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law."135 [[In the
**next foreign relations dispute**]{.underline}]{.mark} between the
branches, [[the judiciary can latch on to]{.mark} Zivotofsky II's stated
[limitations]{.mark}, or **[ignore the mess]{.mark} it

**[distinguish its odd use]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of constitutional

the recognition and passport context.

[To say that [Zivotofsky]{.mark} II [lacks **predictable
consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in the **judiciary**]{.mark} is
not to say that it lacks predictable consequences on **presidential
power**]{.underline}. It will have such consequences in [[the

the judiciary. Unlike judges, [executive branch [lawyers have an]{.mark}

Moreover, focusing only on formal congressional action obscures the more
subtle but substantial ways in which Congress influences decisions about
military intervention. Crucially, the fact that the president often
initiates military campaigns without express authorization by Congress
does not mean that congressional checks are altogether absent. Political
science and history strongly suggest that, notwithstanding the
often-weak electoral incentives of congressional members to formally
approve or disapprove military interventions at their outset,
congressional politics weigh heavily in presidential decision-making.

[**[Studies]{.mark}** [show]{.mark}]{.underline} that
**[[congress]{.mark}ional politics]{.underline}**
[[affect]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[the
**frequency**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[with]{.mark} which presidents use
[force]{.mark}]{.underline} abroad [and the **probability**]{.underline}
that [they will respond militarily]{.underline} to crises. There are
many ways in which [Congress [influences]{.mark}]{.underline}
presidential uses of force, which [[include]{.underline}]{.mark} not
only the introduction of legislation to authorize or curtail a use of
force but also [congressional [oversight
**hearings**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and influencing]{.mark} **[public
debate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[over]{.mark} military
[policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Congressional
action]{.underline}]{.mark} or inaction also [[sends]{.mark} signals
about **[domestic resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign parties --- both [[**adversaries** and
**allies**]{.underline}]{.mark} alike --- thereby [[affecting the
**president's calculus**]{.underline}]{.mark} regarding using force.
Such political checks are especially pronounced when Congress and the
presidency are controlled by opposing parties. Focusing solely on
whether and how Congress formally approves military action on the front
end often neglects these other significant ways Congress can influence
the use of force and how they might be enhanced.

The Diverse Forms of Modern Conflict

Military conflicts and interventions arise in too many ways and forms to
regulate them effectively with a single statutory scheme or a single
form of authorization. For the existing War Powers Resolution and some
of the proposals to strengthen it, relatively clear lines are often seen
as a virtue, because they reduce --- though don't eliminate ---
opportunities to interpret away requirements. However, trying to draw
statutory lines at specific thresholds like armed "hostilities" (as in
the War Powers Resolution) or "significant armed conflicts" (as in the
proposed War Powers Consultation Act) is a poor way of deciding which
types of conflicts should require formal congressional approval.

From the earliest days of the republic, the United States faced varied
military contingencies for which neither war declarations nor simple
congressional force authorizations were well suited. [[In the **modern
era**]{.mark}, American **[conflicts]{.mark}** and **security crises**
[are]{.mark} even more **[diverse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They could
begin because of [[a]{.mark} U.S. first strike or an enemy **[first
strike]{.mark}**, an [attack]{.mark} by or [against]{.mark} a U.S.
**[ally]{.mark}**, or a [breakdown in **deterrence**]{.mark} or a
**[miscalc]{.mark}ulation**]{.underline}. [They might
include]{.underline} **[[large-scale]{.underline}]{.mark}** ground
[[wars]{.underline}]{.mark}, one-off airstrikes, or a combination of the
two, and increasingly they feature cyber operations as well. They can be
overt or covert, or both. They may be geographically confined or global,
or expected to be short or long. They are waged against states or
nonstate groups, with or against a state's proxy forces, and with or
without the help of allies.

Recent controversies over war powers illustrate this point. In 2019,
concerns about insufficiently checked presidential war powers have
arisen in three vastly different contexts: continuation of a
geographically [**sprawling** [and]{.mark} **indefinite**
war]{.underline} against terrorist groups, support for a Saudi war in
Yemen, and [the possibility of a **major** U.S. war with
**Iran**]{.underline}. The first began after a direct attack on the U.S.
homeland, the second is a regional proxy [war]{.underline}, and the
third [could arise through deliberate preemptive U.S. action, [a]{.mark}
miscalculated **[spiral]{.mark} of violence**]{.underline}, or some
other way. Stepping back, the key policy questions about force in each
case differ widely. The first is mostly about where and what type of
force is used, the second has to do with whether to cut off operational
support to a partner, and the third is about how to wield threats of
force for deterrence and coercive diplomacy.

Although recent war powers debates have sometimes focused on regional
conflicts in which the United States does not put many troops directly
in harm's way (at least not initially), a key aim of war powers reform
is often said to be making sure that "big" wars --- those that put many
vulnerable American boots on the ground --- are formally authorized by
Congress. Historically, however, the Korean War stands out as the only
exception to the tendency of presidents to seek congressional
authorization in advance of large ground wars. In any event, these are
the types of conflicts for which political checks often work most
effectively.

Smaller-scale and less visible conflicts attract less public attention,
but their consequences can be significant. "As a matter of democratic
principle," Jack Goldsmith and I have argued, treating low-intensity
warfare waged stealthily and from a distance (or in cyberspace) as more
appropriately conducted unilaterally than large-scale ground campaigns
"probably has matters backwards":

Light-footprint warfare is still lethal and very consequential warfare,
and the lightness of the tools make them relatively easy for a President
to deploy extensively. [[Light]{.mark}-footprint
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[has large **foreign
policy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[strategic]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.mark} **[reputational]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[consequences]{.mark} for the United States]{.underline}, akin to much
heavier deployments, yet much less public examination. The President's
legal theories treat this as a feature of such warfare. But [it
is]{.underline} also [a **bug** for U.S. democracy]{.underline}, since
the stealthy features mean that public debate and political
checks---which reduce error as well as excess, and promote
legitimacy---function ineffectively.

This arguably indicates the need to expand or clarify the War Powers
Resolution's definition of the situations requiring explicit
congressional approval. But any politically plausible attempts to
delineate with bright-line rules which types of military action require
specific forms of congressional authorization will probably function
poorly in practice, where contextual variables are complex and
fast-moving. Such attempts may also still exclude those conflicts for
which stronger congressional scrutiny is appropriate. Alternatively, a
more flexible legal standard would likely be even easier for the
executive branch to bypass. A wide range of **[[military
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** and challenges
[[warrant]{.underline}]{.mark} a wide range of congressional
[[oversight]{.underline}]{.mark} tools. Moreover, as explained below,
requiring congressional approval at the beginning of a military
intervention often fails to encourage the right kind of congressional
scrutiny.

The Purposes of Legislative Checks

Periodic pushes from both members of Congress and the public for
stronger congressional checks on war powers can conceal divisions and
uncertainty about why those checks are needed. Some of the goals of
these efforts for congressional oversight also point to different
solutions.

Sometimes, supporters of war powers reform are pushing for change simply
as a matter of constitutional principle. If one believes that Article
I's directive that Congress has the power to declare war includes any
use of military force (other than in defending against invasion), and
one believes that the president's Article II roles as chief executive
and commander-in-chief confer no authority to initiate such actions,
then nothing short of formal congressional authorization for any
military intervention is likely to be satisfactory. But there have
always been gaps and ambiguities in these constitutional clauses, and
many (though not all) war powers reformers believe in evolving
constitutional interpretation to meet evolving national conditions in
other areas of law. There are good arguments to justify adapting the
original allocations of military powers given the dramatic changes over
200 years in American military power, strategy, and interests, as well
as dramatic changes in the way other, related constitutional powers are
exercised. Reasonable people may disagree about the strength of those
arguments and even whether they work in favor of or against presidential
discretion, but rigid formalism does not point toward a practical
solution.

Other proponents of stronger and formal congressional checks justify
them in policy terms: Imposing legislative requirements would help to
restrain military adventurism. The expectation here is often that the
need to obtain congressional authorization serves as a brake on military
responses to crises, whether because Congress is slower to act than the
executive branch or because it is more sensitive to certain costs and
risks, or just because more procedural hurdles means less action.
Strategically, though, foreign policy retrenchment --- or even
perceptions of it --- carries its own dangers. How well requirements for
formal congressional force authorization contribute to peace and
stability is also far from clear, since some conflicts stem from
breakdowns in deterrence. Politically, commitment to this goal is also
often tied to who holds presidential office, and is therefore fleeting.

A third justification for war powers reform is that requiring
congressional authorization promotes sounder policy through interbranch
deliberation. Such requirements, the argument often goes, push the
executive and legislative branches to consult one another more
thoroughly, and the processes of persuasion and consensus-building
result in more consistent and sustainable security policy. This claim
has logical appeal, though empirical support is uneven. The 1991 and
2003 Iraq Wars were both authorized: The second turned out to be badly
misguided and congressional scrutiny of the first failed to question
core planning assumptions that turned out to be wrong. In any event, [[a
legislative overhaul is **not needed**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to achieve
better interbranch deliberation]{.underline}.

Improving Legislative Oversight

For all of these reasons, war powers reform should not focus on
strengthening any single, formal congressional approval requirement.
Instead, [[Congress should]{.mark} improve the [use]{.mark} of [its
**existing tool set**]{.mark} for overseeing security and defense
policy]{.underline}. As noted above, Congress has a range of tools
available to shape and restrain military policy. These include hearings,
spending bills, and actions to shape public opinion. Importantly and
[unlike legislative overhaul proposals]{.underline}, some of [these
tools do not require Congress as a whole to act]{.underline} --- [they
can be wielded by]{.underline} **[individual members]{.underline}**,
especially [in key committee positions]{.underline}. In recent years,
Congress' foreign policy and defense committees have atrophied, holding
fewer oversight hearings than in the past. A first step to boosting
influence is ensuring that foreign relations, armed services, and
intelligence committee members have adequate experience and resources,
as well as a commitment to shaping and auditing security strategy.

[[Wars **rarely begin** out of the blue]{.mark}, but instead are the
result of a **long series**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} steps and
counter-steps, [actions and inactions]{.underline}. This means that
[[Congress needs to **focus**]{.mark} more heavily [on]{.mark}
**[overall]{.mark} military [strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
how]{.mark} American **military [resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[are
wielded]{.mark} **well [in advance]{.mark}** [of a
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than treating the outbreak of a
crisis as Congress' moment for influence. Regularly scheduled posture
hearings and annual defense authorization bills, for example, should be
understood and treated as core parts of Congress' war powers.

Fixating on congressional authorization of conflicts risks distracting
or relieving lawmakers from the important duty of overseeing their
conduct. Recent authorized wars in Afghanistan and Iraq show that
congressional action at the front end of a conflict does not equate to
thorough scrutiny --- let alone consensus --- of whether means and ends
are well aligned or planning assumptions well tested. Congressional
oversight of military intervention and conflict should be continuous and
focused more heavily on the conduct of campaigns long after their
initiation. So, for instance, the outdated 2001 Authorization for Use of
Military Force directed at al-Qaeda and its allies ought to be revised,
but as an addition to, not a substitute for, unremitting congressional
review of how the various parts of that conflict are waged. The energy
of reformists in Congress would be better spent on overseeing ongoing
conflicts than on pushing new overarching frameworks that are unlikely
to be adopted. Plus, the prospect of probing oversight during conflicts
would bolster Congress' political influence over decisions to intervene
militarily to begin with.

Some will criticize this oversight agenda as too modest. And yet, it
stands a more realistic chance of addressing the problems and improving
the political checks laid out above than a dramatic legislative
revamping would. Others will criticize it as politically unworkable,
essentially asking for a different type of congressional membership,
with different political incentives and institutional commitments, than
the one that exists. That may be so. If that is the case, though, then
ambitions for a radical legislative overhaul --- especially one that
sticks --- do not stand a chance.

Hard as it is to believe in this time of record pandemic deaths,
insurrection, and an unprecedented encore impeachment, [Joe
[Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} is now [officially [at the helm of the **US
war machine**]{.mark}]{.underline}. He is, in other words, the fourth
president to [oversee America's **unending** and **unsuccessful**
post-9/11 military campaigns]{.underline}. In terms of active US combat,
that's only happened once before, in the Philippines, America's
second-longest (if often forgotten) overseas combat campaign.

Yet that conflict was limited to a single Pacific archipelago. [Biden
[inherits a **global war**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [and burgeoning
**new Cold War**]{.underline} --- [[spanning four continents and]{.mark}
a military mired in **[active op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** [in dozens
of countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, [combat in some 14 of
them]{.underline}, [and bombing in at least seven]{.underline}. That
sort of scope has been standard fare for American presidents for almost
two decades now. Still, while this country's post-9/11 war presidents
have more in common than their partisan divisions might suggest,
distinctions do [[matter]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[especially]{.mark} at a
time [when the White House]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [[**unilaterally
drives** foreign policy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

So, what can we expect from Commander in Chief Biden? In other words,
what's the forecast for US service members who have invested their lives
and limbs in future conflict, as well as for the speculators in the
military-industrial complex and anxious foreigners in the countries
still engulfed in America's war on terror who usually stand to lose it
all?

Many Trumpsters, and some libertarians, foresee disaster: that [the man
who]{.underline}, [[as a]{.mark} **leading [senator]{.mark}**
facilitated and [cheered on]{.mark} the disastrous [Iraq]{.mark}
War]{.underline}, [[will **surely escalate** American adventurism
abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the other hand, establishment Democrats
and most liberals, who are desperately (and understandably) relieved to
see Donald Trump go, find that prediction preposterous. Clearly, Biden
must have learned from past mistakes, changed his tune, and should
responsibly bring US wars to a close, even if at a time still to be
determined.

In a sense, both may prove right --- and in another sense, both wrong.
The guess of this long-time war-watcher (and one-time war fighter)
reading the tea leaves: Expect Biden to both eschew big new wars and
avoid fully ending existing ones. At the margins (think Iran), he may
improve matters some; [in **certain rather risky** areas]{.underline}
([Russian relations]{.underline}, for instance), [he could worsen
them]{.underline}; but in most cases (the rest of the Greater Middle
East, Africa, and China), he's likely to remain squarely on the
status-quo spectrum. And mind you, [there's **nothing reassuring** about
that]{.underline}.

It [**[hardly]{.mark} requires** clairvoyance to offer **such
[guesswork]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That's because [[Biden]{.mark}
basically]{.underline} is [who he says he is and]{.underline} who he's
always been, and [the man's simply **[never been
transformational]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [One need [look no further than
his long]{.mark} and]{.underline} generally [[interventionist]{.mark}
past [record or]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[nature of his]{.mark}
**current [national-security picks]{.mark}** [to
know]{.mark}]{.underline} that the safe [[money is on]{.mark} **more of
[the same]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Whether the issues are war, race,
crime, or economics, Uncle [[Joe]{.underline}]{.mark} has [made a career
of [bend]{.mark}ing [with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [prevailing
[political winds]{.mark}]{.underline} and it's unlikely this old dog can
truly learn any new tricks. Furthermore, he's [[filled his foreign
policy squad w]{.mark}ith]{.underline} Obama-Clinton retreads, [a
number]{.underline} of [whom were [**architects**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} --- if not the initial
[[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Afghan]{.underline}]{.mark} debacles
--- then disasters in [[Libya]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[West Africa]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} the [Afghan surge of
2009]{.underline}. In other words, [Biden]{.underline} is
[[putting]{.mark} the **former [arsonists]{.mark}** [in charge of the
**forever-war fire brigade**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There's further reason to fear that he may even reject Trump's "If Obama
was for it, I'm against it" brand of war-on-terror policy-making and
thereby reverse The Donald's very late, very modest troop withdrawals in
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia. Yet even if this new old hand of a
president evades potentially existential escalation with nuclear Russia
or China and offers only an Obama reboot when it comes to persistent
low-intensity warfare, what he does will still matter --- most of all to
the global citizens who are too often its victims. So, here's a brief
region-by-region flyover tour of what Joe's squad may have in store for
both the world and the American military sent to police that world.

THE MIDDLE EAST: OLD PRESCRIPTIONS FOR OLD BUSINESS

It's increasingly clear that Washington's legacy wars in the Greater
Middle East --- Iraq and Afghanistan, in particular --- are generally no
longer on the public's radar. Enter an elected old man who's charged
with handling old business that, at least to most civilians, is old
news. Odds are that Biden's ancient tricks will amount to safe bets in a
region that past US policies essentially destroyed. Joe is likely to
take a middle path in the region between large-scale military
intervention of the Bush or Obama kind and more prudent full-scale
withdrawal.

As a result, such wars will probably drag on just below the threshold of
American public awareness, while avoiding Pentagon or partisan charges
that his version of cutting-and-running endangered US security. The
prospect of "victory" won't even factor into the equation (after all,
Biden's squad members aren't stupid), but political survival certainly
will. Here's what such a Biden-era future might then look like in a few
such sub-theaters.

The war in Afghanistan is hopeless and has long been failing by every
one of the US military's own measurable metrics, so much so that the
Pentagon and the Kabul government classified them all as secret
information a few years back. Actually dealing with the Taliban and
swiftly exiting a disastrous war likely to lead to a disastrous future
with Washington's tail between its legs is, in fact, the only remaining
option. The question is when and how many more Americans will kill or be
killed in that "graveyard of empires" before the United States accepts
the inevitable. Toward the end of his tenure, Trump signaled a serious,
if cynical, intent to so. And since Trump was by definition a monster
and the other team's monsters can't even occasionally be right, a
coalition of establishment Democrats and Lincoln-esque Republicans (and
Pentagon officials) decided that the war must indeed go on. That
culminated in last July's obscenity in which Congress officially
withheld the funds necessary to end it. As vice president, Biden was
better than most in his Afghan War skepticism, but his incoming advisers
weren't, and Joe's nothing if not politically malleable. Besides, since
Trump didn't pull enough troops out faintly fast enough or render the
withdrawal irreversible over Pentagon objections, expect a trademark
Biden hedge here.

[[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark} has [always been a
**boondoggle**]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} the [justifications for
America's peculiar military presence there **constantly shifting** from
pressuring]{.underline} the regime of [Bashar al-Assad]{.underline}, [to
fighting the Islamic State]{.underline}, to [backing the
Kurds]{.underline}, to [balancing Iran and Russia]{.underline} in the
region, to (in Trump's case) [securing]{.underline} that country's
meager [oil supplies]{.underline}. As with so much else, there's a
troubling possibility that, [[in]{.mark} the [Biden
years]{.mark}]{.underline}, [personnel]{.underline} once again may
[[become **destiny**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many of the [new president's
[advisers]{.mark}]{.underline} were [[**bullish** on]{.mark} Syrian
[intervention]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Obama years, even
[[want]{.mark}ing [to **take it further**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
topple Assad. Furthermore, [when it comes time for [them]{.mark} to
[convince Biden to agree]{.mark} to stay put in Syria]{.underline},
[there's a **dangerous existing mix** of motives to do]{.underline} just
[that]{.underline}: the [emotive sympathy for the
[Kurds]{.mark}]{.underline} of known gut-player Joe; his [susceptibility
to revived]{.underline} Islamic State (**[[ISIS]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[fear-mongering]{.mark}; [and perceptions of]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[**toughness-testing proxy [contest]{.mark}** with Russia]{.underline}.

When it comes to Iran, expect Biden to be better than the Iran-phobic
Trump administration, but to stay shackled "inside the box." First of
all, despite Joe's long-expressed desire to reenter the Obama-era
nuclear deal with Iran that Trump so disastrously pulled out of, doing
so may prove harder than he thinks. After all, why should Tehran trust a
political basket case of a negotiating partner prone to significant
partisan policy-pendulum swings, especially given the way Washington has
waged nearly 70 years of interventions against Iran's politicians and
people? In addition, Trump left Biden the Trojan horse of Tehran's
hardliners, empowered by dint of The Donald's pugnacious policies. If
the new president wishes to really undercut Iranian intransigence and
fortify the moderates there, he should go big and be transformational
--- in other words, see Obama's tension-thawing nuclear deal and raise
it with the carrot of full-blown diplomatic and economic normalization.
Unfortunately, status-quo Joe has never been a transformational type.

KEEP AN EYE ON AFRICA

Though it garners far less public interest than the US military's
long-favored Middle Eastern playground, [[Africa]{.mark} **figures
significantly** in]{.underline} the [minds of those at the
Pentagon]{.underline}, in the Capitol, and in Washington's influential
think tanks. [For **interventionist hawks**]{.underline}, including
liberal ones, that [continent]{.underline} has [been]{.underline} both
[[a **petri dish**]{.mark} and]{.underline} a [proving ground
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[development of]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[limited [power-projection]{.mark} paradigm of drones]{.underline},
[[Special Operations]{.mark} forces]{.underline}, military advisers,
[local [proxies]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [clandestine
intelligence missions]{.underline}.

It mattered little that over eight years of the Obama administration ---
from Libya to the West African Sahel to the Horn of East Africa --- the
war on terror proved, at best, problematic indeed, and even worse in the
Trump years. There remains a [worrisome possibility]{.underline} that
the [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} posse might [prove
[amenable]{.mark}]{.underline} yet again [[to]{.mark} the [alarmism
of]{.mark}]{.underline} US Africa Command
([[AFRICOM]{.underline}]{.mark}) [about]{.underline} the [rebirth of
ISIS and]{.underline} the [spread of]{.underline} other [Al Qaeda--inked
groups]{.underline} there, [bolstered by fear-mongering nonsense
masquerading as sophisticated scholarship from West Point]{.underline}'s
Combating Terrorism Center, and the Pentagon's perennial promises of
low-investment, low-risk, and high-reward opportunities on the
continent. So, a [**[savvy bet]{.mark}ting** man]{.underline} might
[[**place chips** on]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[Biden escalation
in]{.mark} West Africa's Sahel and [the **Horn**]{.mark} **of East
Africa**]{.underline}, even if for different reasons.

American Special Forces and military advisors have been in and out of
the remote borderlands between Mali and Niger since at least 2004 and
these days seem there to stay. The French seized and suppressed sections
of the Sahel region beginning in 1892, and, despite granting nominal
independence to those countries in 1960, were back by 2013 and have been
stuck in their own forever wars there ever since. American War on
Terror(izing) and French neocolonizing have only inflamed regional
resistance movements, increased violence, and lent local grievances an
Islamist resonance. Recently, France's lead role there has truly begun
to disintegrate --- with five of its troops killed in just the first few
days of 2021 and allegations that it had bombed another wedding party.
(Already such a War on Terror cliché!)

Don't be surprised if French President Emmanuel Macron asks for help and
Biden agrees to bail him out. Despite their obvious age gap, Joe and
Emmanuel could prove the newest and best of chums. (What's a few hundred
extra troops between friends?)

Especially since Obama-era Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her
then-favored errand boy, incoming national security adviser Jake
[[Sullivan]{.underline}]{.mark}, could be said to have [[founded]{.mark}
the current **coalition of [jihadis]{.mark}** [in Mali and
Niger]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's because [when the two of them
[championed]{.mark} a [heavy-handed]{.mark} **regime-change
[intervention]{.mark}** against]{.underline} Libyan autocrat Moammar
[El-Gadhafi]{.underline} in 2011, thousands of his Tuareg fighters blew
back into that region in a big way with more than just the clothes on
their backs. They [streamed]{.underline} from post-Gadhafi Libya
[into]{.underline} their Sahel [homelands loaded with arms and
anger]{.underline}. It's no accident, in other words, that Mali's latest
round of insurgency kicked off in 2012. [[Now]{.underline}]{.mark},
[Sullivan might [push]{.mark} **new boss [Biden]{.mark}**]{.underline}
to attempt to clean up his old mess.

On the other side of the continent, in [[Somalia]{.underline}]{.mark},
where Trump began an eleventh-hour withdrawal of a long-failing and
aimless US troop presence (sending most of those soldiers to neighboring
countries), [there's a **real risk**]{.underline} that [Biden could
**[double-down]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline}, [adding
soldiers]{.underline}, [special operators]{.underline}, [and
drones]{.underline}. After all, if Trump was against it, even after
exponentially increasing bombing in the area, then any good Democrat
should be for it, especially since the Pentagon has, for some time now,
been banging the drum about Somalia's al-Shabaab Islamist outfit being
the biggest threat to the homeland.

However, [the **real [selling point]{.mark}** [for Biden]{.mark} might
be [the fantasy]{.mark}]{.underline} [that [Russia and China]{.mark} are
**[flooding into the region]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ever since the 2018
National Defense Strategy decisively shifted the Pentagon's focus from
counterterrorism wars to "great power competition," or GPC, AFRICOM has
opportunistically altered its own campaign plan to align with the new
threat of the moment, honing in on Russian and Chinese influence in the
Horn region. As a result, AFRICOM'S come-back-to-the-Horn pitch could
prove a relatively easy Biden sell.

TOUGHNESS TRAPS: POKING RUSSIAN BEARS, RAMMING CHINESE (SEA) DRAGONS

With that new GPC national security obsession likely to be one Trump-era
policy that remains firmly in place, however ill-advised it may be,
[perhaps the **[biggest]{.mark} Biden [risk]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[possibility of]{.mark}]{.underline}
stoking up [a]{.underline} "[[new]{.underline}]{.mark},"
[[two-theater]{.mark}, [21st century]{.mark} version of the [Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline} (with the possibility
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}, at any moment, it could [[turn]{.mark} into
a **[hot]{.mark} one**]{.underline}). After making everything all about
Russia in the Trump years, the ascendant [Democrats]{.underline} might
just feel obliged to follow through and [escalate [tensions]{.mark} with
Moscow]{.underline} that Trump himself already [brought to the
[brink]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[of **nuclear
catastrophe**]{.underline}]{.mark}). Here, too, personnel may prove a
key policy-driver.

Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Anthony
[[Blinken]{.underline}]{.mark}, [is a]{.underline} resident [Russia
hawk]{.underline} and was an early "arm Ukraine" enthusiast. Jake
[[Sullivan]{.underline}]{.mark} already has a tendency to [make
**mountains out of molehills**]{.underline} on the subject, as when he
described a minor road-rage incident as constituting "a Russian force in
Syria aggressively attack\[ing\] an American force and actually
injur\[ing\] American service members." Then there's the troubling
signal of Victoria [[Nuland]{.underline}]{.mark}, the recent nominee for
undersecretary of state for political affairs, a pick that itself should
be considered [a [**road-rage-style** provocation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Nuland [[has]{.mark} a [history of **hawkish antagonism** toward Moscow
and is]{.mark}]{.underline} reportedly [[despised
by]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Her confirmation]{.underline}]{.mark}
will [[**surely serve** as a conflict accelerant]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Nevertheless, China may be the lead antagonist in the
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} crew's race to risk a foolhardy cataclysm.
Throughout the election campaign, the new president seemed set on
out-hawking Trump in the Western Pacific, [[**explicitly writing**
about]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[getting tough]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[on
China]{.underline}]{.mark} in a March 2020 piece he penned in Foreign
Affairs. Joe had [also previously [called]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese
President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping "**[[a
thug]{.underline}]{.mark}**." And while Michèle
[[Flournoy]{.underline}]{.mark} may (mercifully) have been passed over
for secretary of defense, her aggressive posture toward Beijing still
infuses the thinking of her fellow Obama alums on Biden's team.

As TomDispatch regular Andrew Bacevich pointed out last September, a
Flournoy Foreign Affairs article illuminated the sort of absurdity she
(along with assumedly various Biden appointees) thinks necessary to
effectively deter China. She [[called for]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[enhancing U.S. military capabilities so]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can **credibly threaten** to sink
all of China's]{.mark} military [vessels]{.mark}]{.underline},
[submarines]{.underline}, [and merchant ships [in the **S**]{.mark}outh
**[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea [within 72
hours]{.mark}]{.underline}." Consider that Dr. Strangelove-style
strategizing retooled for an inbound [urbane imperial
presidency]{.underline}.

round of insurgency kicked off in 2012. [[Now]{.underline}]{.mark},
[Sullivan might [push]{.mark} **new boss [Biden]{.mark}**]{.underline}
to attempt to clean up his old mess.

On the other side of the continent, in [[Somalia]{.underline}]{.mark},
where Trump began an eleventh-hour withdrawal of a long-failing and
aimless US troop presence (sending most of those soldiers to neighboring
countries), [there's a **real risk**]{.underline} that [Biden could
**[double-down]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline}, [adding
soldiers]{.underline}, [special operators]{.underline}, [and
drones]{.underline}. After all, if Trump was against it, even after
exponentially increasing bombing in the area, then any good Democrat
should be for it, especially since the Pentagon has, for some time now,
been banging the drum about Somalia's al-Shabaab Islamist outfit being
the biggest threat to the homeland.

However, [the **real [selling point]{.mark}** [for Biden]{.mark} might
be [the fantasy]{.mark}]{.underline} [that [Russia and China]{.mark} are
**[flooding into the region]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ever since the 2018
National Defense Strategy decisively shifted the Pentagon's focus from
counterterrorism wars to "great power competition," or GPC, AFRICOM has
opportunistically altered its own campaign plan to align with the new
threat of the moment, honing in on Russian and Chinese influence in the
Horn region. As a result, AFRICOM'S come-back-to-the-Horn pitch could
prove a relatively easy Biden sell.

#### Africa is the site of a [new Cold War]{.underline} --- causes great power conflict and transnational terror.

The securitization of development --- the subordination of growth and
development objectives to security priorities --- has failed to deliver
security and has only ever undermined development. As I argue in my
recent paper, "[[Dawn of a **second Cold War**]{.mark} and]{.underline}
the '[[scramble for Africa]{.underline}]{.mark},'" [[outsourcing]{.mark}
domestic security]{.underline} has failed to bring peace and instead
[[enabled]{.mark} [foreign powers to meddle in]{.mark} **domestic
insurgencies** and **prolong [conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These
[undermine regional integration and economic development]{.underline},
as is apparent today in Libya and Mali, which have been theaters of war
for more than a decade.

THE RISE OF TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST NETWORKS AND THE NEW COLD WAR

Recently, the [**dramatic [increase]{.mark}** [in **high-intensity
conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} and conflict-related deaths in the
region has [[coincided with]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[expansion of
**transnational terrorist**]{.mark} **networks**]{.underline}, which
have been [sustained by a glut of itinerant foreign fighters
and]{.underline} the [[proliferation of]{.mark} foreign military [bases
amid **geopolitical realignments** and **rising
tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even though the Ukraine crisis has
reinvigorated the East-West tensions that defined the latter half of the
previous century, new geopolitical alliances are emerging shaped by the
triangulation that dominated the first Cold War.

That geopolitical realignment has been [[in **full swing** in Africa
where proxy wars]{.mark} are **[raging]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
including in Ethiopia, which hosts the African Union's headquarters ---
[as competing powers vie for control of natural resources
and]{.underline} strategic [trade routes]{.underline}. This [butting of
heads [between **superpowers**]{.mark}]{.underline} has [set the world
on]{.underline} the [path toward a **new Cold War**]{.underline}, [and
Africa]{.underline} has again emerged as [an arena]{.underline} in which
to exercise their rivalries.

[Across all continents]{.underline}, [[Africa]{.mark} now [has the
**largest number of**]{.mark} **foreign [countries]{.mark}** [carrying
out]{.mark} military [operations]{.mark} on its soil]{.underline} --- no
fewer than 13, of which most have several military bases spread
throughout the region. Per the most recent official estimates,
[Africa]{.underline} is [home to **at least 47** foreign
outposts]{.underline}, with the U.S. controlling the largest share,
followed by former colonial power France. Both China and Japan elected
to establish their first overseas military bases since the Second World
War in [Djibouti]{.underline}, which happens to be [the only
country]{.underline} in the world [to host **both** American and Chinese
outposts]{.underline}.

REPERCUSSIONS FOR AFRICA OF THE FIRST COLD WAR

The scars of the first Cold War --- which claimed millions of African
lives and undermined both regional integration and economic development,
with conflicts reducing economic growth in affected countries by about
2.5 percent on average --- are still fresh, and the region cannot
possibly afford to fall prey to a second.

In addition to immeasurable human and economic costs, including the
destruction of economic and physical infrastructure required for
productivity growth and export diversification, the [**political
[fragmentation]{.mark}** that [arose as countries aligned themselves
with]{.mark} one of the two [superpower blocs]{.mark} was a **major
ramification** of the first Cold War]{.underline}. That fragmentation
sustained market segmentation, hardening colonial borders and
undermining cross-border trade and regional integration. A [second Cold
War]{.underline}, [on the heels of the **proliferation** of foreign
military bases and]{.underline} the [outsourcing]{.underline} of
[national security]{.underline}, would [likewise undermine efforts to
defragment African economies and]{.underline} accelerate the process of
structural transformation to realize the potential of the African
Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), which has been touted as [a
**game changer**]{.underline}.

[[A]{.mark} small]{.underline} and primitive [[1-kiloton]{.mark}
**fission [bomb]{.mark}**]{.underline} (with a yield of about
one-fifteenth of the one dropped on Hiroshima, and certainly much less
sophisticated; cf. Figure 1), [detonated in any]{.underline} large
capital [city]{.underline} of the developed world, [would [cause]{.mark}
an **[unprecedented catastrophic scenario]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

An estimate of direct effects in the attack's location includes a death
toll of 7,300-to-23,000 people and 12,600-to-57,000 people injured,
depending on the target's geography and population density.
[[Total]{.mark} **physical [destruction]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the city's
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}, due to the blast (shock wave) and
thermal radiation, would cover a radius of about 500 meters from the
point of detonation (also known as ground zero), while [ionizing
[radiation]{.mark} **greater than 5 Sieverts**]{.underline} ---
compatible with the deadly acute radiation syndrome --- would expand
within an 850-meter radius. From the [environmental point of
view]{.underline}, such an [area]{.underline} would be [**unusable** for
years]{.underline}. In addition, radioactive fallout would expand in an
area of about 300 square kilometers, depending on meteorological
conditions (cf. Figure 2).

But the [[consequences]{.mark} would]{.underline} go far beyond the
effects in the target country, however, and [**promptly
[propagate]{.mark}** [worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Global]{.underline}]{.mark} and national
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, economy and finance, [[international
governance]{.underline}]{.mark} and its framework, [[national political
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[behavior
of governments]{.underline}]{.mark} and individuals [would]{.underline}
all [be [put under **severe trial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The severity
of the effects at a national level, however, would depend on the
countries' level of development, geopolitical location, and resilience.
[Global security and]{.underline} regional/national [defense schemes
would be **strongly affected**]{.underline}. An [increase in global
[distrust]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[spark **rising tensions**]{.mark}
among countries]{.underline} and blocs, [[that]{.underline}]{.mark}
could even [[lead to]{.mark} the brink of **[nuclear]{.mark} weapons
[use]{.mark}** by states]{.underline} (if, for instance, a sponsor
country is identified). The [consequences of such a shocking
scenario]{.underline} would [include]{.underline} a [[decrease]{.mark}
in states' [self-control]{.mark}]{.underline}, an [[escalation of
present conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} and the [[emergence of new
ones]{.underline}]{.mark}, [accompanied by]{.underline} an [increase in
**military [unilateralism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **military
[expenditures]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Regarding the economic and financial impacts, a severe global economic
depression would rise from the attack, likely lasting for years. Its
duration would be strongly dependent on the course of the crisis. The
main results of such a crisis would include a 2 percent fall of growth
in global Gross Domestic Product, and a 4 percent decline of
international trade in the two years following the attack (cf. Figure
3). In the case of developing and less-developed countries, the economic
impacts would also include a shortage of high-technology products such
as medicines, as well as a fall in foreign direct investment and a
severe decline of international humanitarian aid toward low-income
countries. We expect an increase of unemployment and poverty in all
countries. Global poverty would raise about 4 percent after the attack,
which implies that at least 30 million more people would be living in
extreme poverty, in addition to the current estimated 767 million.

In the area of international relations, we would expect a [breakdown of
key doctrines involving politics]{.underline}, [security]{.underline},
[and relations among states]{.underline}. These [international
tensions]{.underline} could lead to a [[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} of
[[the nuclear order]{.underline}]{.mark} as we know it today,
[with]{.underline} a [consequent [setback]{.mark} of nuclear disarmament
and **[nonprolif]{.mark}eration commitments**]{.underline}. In other
words, the whole system based on the [**[N]{.mark}**uclear Non-
**[P]{.mark}**roliferation **[T]{.mark}**reaty]{.underline} would be
[put [under **severe trial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After the attack,
there would be a [reassessment of existing security
doctrines]{.underline}, and a deep review of concepts such as [[nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**[n]{.mark}**o-**[f]{.mark}**irst
**[u]{.mark}**se]{.underline}, [[proportionality]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} negative security
[[assurances]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Finally, the [[behavior of governments]{.underline}]{.mark} and
individuals [would]{.underline} also [[change
**radically**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Internal chaos]{.mark} fueled by
the media]{.underline} and social networks would [[threaten governance
at **all levels**]{.underline}]{.mark}, with greater impact on those
countries with weak institutional frameworks. **[Social
turbulence]{.underline}** would [emerge in most countries]{.underline},
with consequent attempts by governments to impose restrictions on
personal freedoms to preserve order --- possibly by declaring a state of
siege or state of emergency --- and legislation would surely become
tougher on human rights. There would also be a significant increase in
[social fragmentation]{.underline} --- with a
[[deepening]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[antagonistic
views]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[mistrust]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and
intolerance]{.underline}]{.mark}, [both within countries and towards
others]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline} a [[resurgence of
**large-scale**]{.mark} **social [movements]{.mark}** [fostered by
**ideological interests**]{.mark}]{.underline} and easily mobilized
through social media.

### 2NC --- ! --- China

#### Causes war with China.

Nevertheless, China may be the lead antagonist in the
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} crew's race to risk a foolhardy cataclysm.
Throughout the election campaign, the new president seemed set on
out-hawking Trump in the Western Pacific, [[**explicitly writing**
about]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[getting tough]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[on
China]{.underline}]{.mark} in a March 2020 piece he penned in Foreign
Affairs. Joe had [also previously [called]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese
President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping "**[[a
thug]{.underline}]{.mark}**." And while Michèle
[[Flournoy]{.underline}]{.mark} may (mercifully) have been passed over
for secretary of defense, her aggressive posture toward Beijing still
infuses the thinking of her fellow Obama alums on Biden's team.

As TomDispatch regular Andrew Bacevich pointed out last September, a
Flournoy Foreign Affairs article illuminated the sort of absurdity she
(along with assumedly various Biden appointees) thinks necessary to
effectively deter China. She [[called for]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[enhancing U.S. military capabilities so]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can **credibly threaten** to sink

[submarines]{.underline}, [and merchant ships [in the **S**]{.mark}outh

strategizing retooled for an inbound [urbane imperial

#### Goes nuclear [quickly]{.underline}.

Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} has [raised the specter of
nuclear war]{.underline}, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed
his nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. [But if
China attempted to]{.underline} forcibly [invade [Taiwan]{.mark} and the
United States came to Taipei's aid]{.underline}, the [[threat of
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} could
**[[outstrip]{.underline}]{.mark}** even [[the]{.mark} **current
nerve-wracking [situation]{.mark}** [in Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A [recent war game]{.underline}, [conducted by]{.underline} the [Center
for a New American Security]{.underline} in conjunction with the NBC
program "Meet the Press," [demonstrated]{.underline} just [**how
[quickly]{.mark}** such a conflict could [escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027, with the aim of
examining how the United States and China might act under a certain set
of conditions. The game demonstrated that [China's **military
[modernization]{.mark}** [and expansion of]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[[nuclear arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark} --- not to mention the importance
Beijing places on unification with Taiwan ---
[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that, in the real world, [[a fight]{.mark}
between China and the United States]{.underline} could **[very well [go
nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway republic. If the Chinese Communist
Party decides to invade the island, its leaders may not be able to
accept failure without seriously harming the regime's legitimacy. Thus,
the [[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark} might be [[willing to take]{.mark}
**significant [risks]{.mark}** to ensure]{.underline} that the [conflict
ends on terms]{.underline} that [it finds acceptable]{.underline}. That
would mean convincing the United States and its allies that the costs of
defending Taiwan are so high that it is not worth contesting the
invasion. While China has several ways to achieve that goal, [[from
Beijing's perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[using nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} may be [[the **most effective**]{.mark}
**means**]{.underline} to keep the United States out of the conflict.

China is several decades into transforming its People's Liberation Army
([PLA]{.underline}) into what the Chinese President Xi Jinping has
called a "**[world-class military]{.underline}**" [that could defeat any
third party]{.underline} that comes to Taiwan's defense. China's
warfighting strategy, known as "anti-access/area denial," rests on being
able to project conventional military power out several thousand miles
in order to prevent the American military, in particular, from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, a [growing
nuclear arsenal provides Beijing with **coercive leverage** as well
as]{.underline} potentially [new **warfighting
capabilities**]{.underline}, which could [increase]{.underline} the
[risks of war and escalation]{.underline}.

China has historically possessed only a few hundred ground-based nuclear
weapons. But last year, nuclear scholars at the James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies and the Federation of American Scientists
identified three missile silo fields under construction in the Xinjiang
region. The Financial Times reported that China might have carried out
tests of hypersonic gliders as a part of an orbital bombardment system
that could evade missile defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets
in the continental United States. The U.S. Department of Defense
projects that by 2030, [China]{.underline} will [have around
**[1,000]{.mark} deliverable [warheads]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
[**more than [triple]{.mark}** [the number]{.mark} it currently
possesses]{.underline}. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders may
believe that as early as five years from now the PLA will have made
enough conventional and nuclear gains that it could fight and win a war
to unify with Taiwan.

A fight between China and the United States could very well go nuclear.

Our recent war game --- in which members of Congress, former government
officials, and subject matter [[experts]{.underline}]{.mark} assumed the
roles of senior national security decision makers in China and the
United States --- [[illustrated]{.underline}]{.mark} that [a U.S.-China
war could **escalate quickly**]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed
that [both countries]{.underline} would [face operational [incentives to
strike]{.mark} military forces on the other's territory]{.underline}. In
the game, such [strikes]{.underline} were intended to be calibrated to
avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk a fine line by attacking only
military targets. But such attacks crossed red lines for both countries,
and [[produced]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[tit-for-tat **cycle**]{.mark}
**of attacks** [that broadened]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**scope** and
**intensity** of]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For instance, in the simulation, [China launched]{.underline} a
[**preemptive attack** against]{.underline} key U.S. [bases in the
Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}. The attacks [targeted
Guam]{.underline}, in particular, because it is a forward operating base
critical to U.S. military operations in Asia, and because since it is a
territory, and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed striking it as
less escalatory than attacking other possible targets. [In
response]{.underline}, [the United States targeted Chinese]{.underline}
military [ships in ports]{.underline} and surrounding facilities, but
refrained from other attacks on the Chinese mainland. Nevertheless,
[both sides perceived]{.underline} these [strikes as attacks
on]{.underline} their [home territory]{.underline}, [crossing an
**important threshold**]{.underline}. Instead of mirror-imaging their
own concerns about attacks on their territory, each side justified the
initial blows as military necessities that were limited in nature and
would be seen by the other as such. [Responses to]{.underline} the
[initial strikes]{.underline} only [escalated]{.underline} things
further [as the U.S.]{.underline} team [responded to China's moves by
hitting]{.underline} targets in [mainland China]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the [Chinese]{.underline} team [responded to
Washington's strikes by attacking]{.underline} sites in
[Hawaii]{.underline}.

A NEW ERA

One [**particularly alarming** finding]{.underline} from the war game
[is]{.underline} that [[China found it necessary]{.underline}]{.mark} to
[threaten [to go nuclear **from the start**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
order [to ward]{.underline} off [outside support for
Taiwan]{.underline}. This [threat]{.underline} was [repeated
throughout]{.underline} the game, particularly after mainland China had
been attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so that it
would back down from the fight received greater attention by the China
team than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty
convincing the United States that its nuclear threats were credible. In
real life, China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture
and readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats
may not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use,
its smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience
making nuclear threats. This may [push China to **preemptively
detonate** a nuclear weapon to reinforce]{.underline} the
[credibility]{.underline} of its warning.

China might also resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because
of constraints on its long-range conventional strike capabilities. Five
years from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response.

The [**most likely** paths to nuclear escalation]{.underline} in a fight
between the United States and China are [different from]{.underline}
those that were most likely during [the Cold War]{.underline}. The
Soviet Union and the United States feared a massive, blot-from-the-blue
nuclear attack, which would precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange.
In a confrontation over Taiwan, however, [Beijing]{.underline} could
[employ nuclear weapons]{.underline} in a more limited way [to signal
resolve or]{.underline} to [improve]{.underline} its [chances of
winning]{.underline} on the battlefield. It is [[unclear
how]{.underline}]{.mark} a [war would proceed after that]{.underline}
kind of limited nuclear use and [whether [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [could **de-escalate**]{.mark} **the
situation**]{.underline} while still achieving its objectives.

AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION

The clear lesson from the war game is that the United States needs to
strengthen its conventional capabilities in the Indo-Pacific to ensure
that China never views an invasion of Taiwan as a prudent tactical move.
To do so, the United States will need to commit to maintaining its
conventional military superiority by expanding its stockpiles of
long-range munitions and investing in undersea capabilities. Washington
must also be able to conduct offensive operations inside the first and
second island chains even while under attack. This will require access
to new bases to distribute U.S. forces, enhance their survivability, and
ensure that they can effectively defend Taiwan in the face of China's
attacks.

Moreover, the United States needs to develop an integrated network of
partners willing to contribute to Taiwan's defense. Allies are an
asymmetric advantage: the United States has them, and China does not.
The United States should deepen strategic and operational planning with
key partners to send a strong signal of resolve to China. As part of
these planning efforts, the United States and its allies will need to
develop war-winning military strategies that do not cross Chinese
red-lines. The game highlighted just how difficult this task may be;
what it did not highlight is the complexity of developing military
strategies that integrate the strategic objectives and military
capacities of multiple nations.

Moving forward, military planners in the United States and in
Washington's allies and partners must grapple with the fact that,
[in]{.underline} a [conflict over [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[consider all]{.mark} **conventional
and nuclear [options]{.mark}**]{.underline} to be [[on the
table]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [the **U**nited **S**tates is running
out of time]{.underline} to strengthen deterrence and keep China from
believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful. The [biggest risk
is]{.underline} that [Washington]{.underline} and its friends [choose
not to seize the moment and]{.underline} act: [a year]{.underline} or
two [from now]{.underline}, [it]{.underline} might [**already be** too
late]{.underline}.

[[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark} has [always been a
**boondoggle**]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} the [justifications for
America's peculiar military presence there **constantly shifting** from
pressuring]{.underline} the regime of [Bashar al-Assad]{.underline}, [to
fighting the Islamic State]{.underline}, to [backing the
Kurds]{.underline}, to [balancing Iran and Russia]{.underline} in the
region, to (in Trump's case) [securing]{.underline} that country's
meager [oil supplies]{.underline}. As with so much else, there's a
troubling possibility that, [[in]{.mark} the [Biden
years]{.mark}]{.underline}, [personnel]{.underline} once again may
[[become **destiny**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many of the [new president's
[advisers]{.mark}]{.underline} were [[**bullish** on]{.mark} Syrian
[intervention]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Obama years, even
[[want]{.mark}ing [to **take it further**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
topple Assad. Furthermore, [when it comes time for [them]{.mark} to
[convince Biden to agree]{.mark} to stay put in Syria]{.underline},
[there's a **dangerous existing mix** of motives to do]{.underline} just
[that]{.underline}: the [emotive sympathy for the
[Kurds]{.mark}]{.underline} of known gut-player Joe; his [susceptibility
to revived]{.underline} Islamic State (**[[ISIS]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[fear-mongering]{.mark}; [and perceptions of]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[**toughness-testing proxy [contest]{.mark}** with Russia]{.underline}.

When it comes to Iran, expect Biden to be better than the Iran-phobic
Trump administration, but to stay shackled "inside the box." First of
all, despite Joe's long-expressed desire to reenter the Obama-era
nuclear deal with Iran that Trump so disastrously pulled out of, doing
so may prove harder than he thinks. After all, why should Tehran trust a
political basket case of a negotiating partner prone to significant
partisan policy-pendulum swings, especially given the way Washington has
waged nearly 70 years of interventions against Iran's politicians and
people? In addition, Trump left Biden the Trojan horse of Tehran's
hardliners, empowered by dint of The Donald's pugnacious policies. If
the new president wishes to really undercut Iranian intransigence and
fortify the moderates there, he should go big and be transformational
--- in other words, see Obama's tension-thawing nuclear deal and raise
it with the carrot of full-blown diplomatic and economic normalization.

As U.S. President Joe Biden and his team focus on the Iran nuclear file,
the [war in [Syria]{.mark} remains a **[festering]{.mark} wound** [at
the **heart** of the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although the
current administration has made no dramatic departures from the approach
of previous administrations, its decision to deprioritize the conflict
comes at a particularly bad time. [Opportunities to find a solution
to]{.underline} the [Syria crisis are]{.underline} now
[emerging]{.underline} --- [and the United States should
devote]{.underline} the [**diplomatic energy** necessary]{.underline} to
seize them. The keys to success after years of failure include not just
high-level engagement but a realistic assessment of what can be achieved
in any deal.

The [[risks]{.underline}]{.mark} in keeping Syria on the back burner
[[are **significant**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[conflict]{.mark} is
already a **strategic train wreck**]{.underline}: a
[victory]{.underline} by President Bashar al-Assad's regime would [[send
a message]{.mark} to autocrats [across the globe]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[**mass murder** is]{.mark} a [viable]{.mark} tactic for retaining
power and]{.underline} signal the [[regional ascendance
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Assad's [[Russian and Iranian
enablers]{.underline}]{.mark}. It has [also [spawned **geopolitical
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline}, from the rise of the Islamic State (also
known as **[[ISIS]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [to]{.underline} the
[[deployment of Iranian]{.mark} precision [missiles]{.mark} that [target
Israel]{.mark}]{.underline}, to the [massive [refugee
flows]{.mark}]{.underline} that [threaten to destabilize **neighboring
states** and Europe]{.underline}. And for Syrians themselves, the
decade-long civil war has resulted in horrendous casualties, displaced
half the population from their homes, and left most citizens destitute.
If left unaddressed, these [[dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark} will threaten
to [[destabilize the Middle East for **years to
come**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Syria's war]{.underline} has [also **[drawn in]{.mark}**]{.underline}
the [[U]{.mark}.[S]{.mark}.]{.underline},
[[Israeli]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[Turkish]{.mark}
militaries]{.underline}, and the risk of clashes between them and
[[Iranian]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[Syrian [forces]{.mark}]{.underline} remains very real. Washington views
the Syrian Democratic Forces' (SDF) enclave in northeastern Syria as an
important ally against ISIS, but Ankara views the Kurdish group as a
terrorist threat. Two recent provocations --- Assad's violation in July
of a 2017 cease-fire in the southwest that had been negotiated between
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and an
attack by Iranian-backed fighters in October against U.S. forces at
their al-Tanf base in southern Syria --- came without noticeable
American response and could encourage Assad or the Iranians to escalate
in areas patrolled by Turkish or U.S. troops.

TOUGHNESS TRAPS: POKING RUSSIAN BEARS, RAMMING CHINESE (SEA) DRAGONS

With that new GPC national security obsession likely to be one Trump-era
policy that remains firmly in place, however ill-advised it may be,
[perhaps the **[biggest]{.mark} Biden [risk]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[possibility of]{.mark}]{.underline}
stoking up [a]{.underline} "[[new]{.underline}]{.mark},"
[[two-theater]{.mark}, [21st century]{.mark} version of the [Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline} (with the possibility
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}, at any moment, it could [[turn]{.mark} into
a **[hot]{.mark} one**]{.underline}). After making everything all about
Russia in the Trump years, the ascendant [Democrats]{.underline} might
just feel obliged to follow through and [escalate [tensions]{.mark} with
Moscow]{.underline} that Trump himself already [brought to the
[brink]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[of **nuclear
catastrophe**]{.underline}]{.mark}). Here, too, personnel may prove a
key policy-driver.

Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Anthony
[[Blinken]{.underline}]{.mark}, [is a]{.underline} resident [Russia
hawk]{.underline} and was an early "arm Ukraine" enthusiast. Jake
[[Sullivan]{.underline}]{.mark} already has a tendency to [make
**mountains out of molehills**]{.underline} on the subject, as when he
described a minor road-rage incident as constituting "a Russian force in
Syria aggressively attack\[ing\] an American force and actually
injur\[ing\] American service members." Then there's the troubling
signal of Victoria [[Nuland]{.underline}]{.mark}, the recent nominee for
undersecretary of state for political affairs, a pick that itself should
be considered [a [**road-rage-style** provocation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Nuland [[has]{.mark} a [history of **hawkish antagonism** toward Moscow
and is]{.mark}]{.underline} reportedly [[despised
by]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Her confirmation]{.underline}]{.mark}
will [[**surely serve** as a conflict accelerant]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [aftermath could be **much worse**: the burning]{.underline} of
flammable materials [could [send]{.mark} massive amounts of [smoke into
the atmosphere]{.mark}, which would [absorb
sunlight]{.mark}]{.underline} and cause sustained global cooling,
[severe [ozone loss]{.mark}, and [ag]{.mark}ricultural
[disruption]{.mark} --- a **[nuclear winter]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
According to one model 9 , an [all-out exchange of 4,000
weapons]{.underline}10 [could lead to a [drop]{.mark} in global
[temperatures of]{.mark}]{.underline} around [[8°C]{.mark}, making it
**impossible** to grow food]{.underline} for 4 to 5 years. This could
leave some survivors in parts of Australia and New Zealand, but they
would be in a very precarious situation and [the threat of
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} from other sources [would be great. An
exchange on this scale is [**only possible** between the US and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} who have more than 90% of the world's
nuclear weapons, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads each, although
many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models suggest that even [a
[small]{.mark} **regional [nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline} involving
100 nuclear weapons would produce a nuclear winter serious enough to put
two billion people at risk of starvation,12 though this estimate might
be pessimistic.13 [Wars on this scale are [**unlikely** to lead
to]{.mark}]{.underline} outright [human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}, but this does suggest that conflicts
which are around an order of magnitude larger may be likely to threaten
civilisation. [It should be emphasised that there is very **large
uncertainty** about the effects of a large nuclear war on global
climate.]{.underline} This remains an area where increased academic
research work, including more detailed climate modelling and a better
understanding of how survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would
have high returns.

[It is]{.underline} very **[difficult to]{.underline}** precisely
[**estimate** the probability of existential risk from nuclear
war]{.underline} over the next century, and existing attempts leave very
large confidence intervals. According to many experts, the most likely
nuclear war at present is between India and Pakistan.14 However, [[given
the]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively modest [[size of]{.mark} their
[arsenals]{.mark}, the [risk of]{.mark} **human [extinction]{.mark}**
is]{.underline} plausibly [[**greater** from]{.mark} a [conflict between
the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Tensions between these countries have
increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the
possibility of them rising further in the future.

Most of the lower [courts treated [Goldwater]{.mark}]{.underline}
primarily as a [case [signaling]{.mark} an [**extreme hands-off**
approach to foreign affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least at first.53
Certainly, Justice [[Rehnquist's]{.underline}]{.mark} opinion seems to
[[put foreign affairs cases in a **special justiciability
category**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even though he claimed that the
question of treaty termination constitutes a political question, that
conclusion required an extremely unusual approach to the doctrine.54
Federal courts usually find a political question when a case involves a
"lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards" for resolving
the question before the Court.55 The [Supreme Court relied on
this]{.underline} factor [in 2019]{.underline} in holding that questions
about the fairness of political gerrymandering constitute political
questions, and it also helps explain the one case Justice Rehnquist
relied upon, Coleman v. Miller. 56 Nobody claimed that the issue of
treaty termination poses a manageable standards problem, which may
explain why the entire D.C. Circuit unanimously rejected President
Carter's political question defense. 57 [The [two other Supreme Court
cases]{.mark}]{.underline} that somewhat [[**recently found** political
questions]{.mark} found]{.underline} "a [**textually demonstrable**
constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political
department]{.underline}."58 In one of these cases, the [Court
held]{.underline} that [questions about]{.underline} the procedures
Congress uses to handle [**[impeachments]{.mark}** constitute political
questions]{.underline} because the Constitution commits impeachment to
Congress.59 In the other case, it held that the Constitution assigns
[[regulation of the **National Guard**]{.underline}]{.mark} to Congress
and the President.60 Justice Rehnquist's opinion, however, does not
claim that the Constitution assigns the decision about who has a right
to terminate a treaty to another branch of government.61

D. [**Foreign Policy** and **War**]{.underline}

There are a [[few]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[subjects to which the
formal **p**]{.mark}olitical **[q]{.mark}**uestion
**[d]{.mark}**octrine]{.underline} is [**[commonly said]{.mark}** to
apply]{.underline}, [[**notably** foreign]{.mark} or war
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline} and the mapping of electoral
constituencies: but [[judicial abstention]{.underline}]{.mark} --- that
is, the prospect that the [courts]{.underline} will [decline to
intervene]{.underline} --- on some of these issues is even less certain
than it is for Guarantee Clause and impeachment cases.

In recent decades, the two leading cases on foreign affairs and on war
as non-justiciable political questions were (1) a case involving the
presidential abrogation of a treaty and (2) a case in which a member of
Congress challenged the constitutionality of a use of military force in
the absence of a congressional declaration of war.

The Constitution provides for the President to make treaties "by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate", two-thirds of the Senators
concurring, but the Constitution says nothing about how a treaty can be
brought to an end (or "denounced" in foreign relations jargon). In 1979
President Carter abrogated a US treaty with the Republic of China
(Taiwan) in order to open diplomatic relations with the People's
Republic of China. A group of Senators, led by Barry
[[Goldwater]{.underline}]{.mark}, sued on the ground that the Senate had
not approved the abrogation of the Taiwan treaty, and hence that the
President had acted unconstitutionally. The [[Supreme Court
**dismissed**]{.mark} **the suit**]{.underline}, with four Justices ---
but not five, who would have been needed for a majority ---
[[saying]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[this was a **political question**
involving executive and congressional power over foreign
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} [**nonjusticiable** by the

The political question doctrine is not without its critics. One

### 2NC --- I/L --- Spillover

#### One case is [sufficient]{.underline}\-\--compelling enforcement makes separating the court's role [impossible]{.underline}. 

**Price '16** \[Zachary; 2016; Associate Professor in the Hastings
College of the Law at the University of California, J.D. from Harvard
University, A.B. from Stanford University; Notre Dame Law Review, "Law
Enforcement as Political Question," vol. 91\]

This Article proposes a framework for nonenforcement's reviewability---
one rooted in considerations of "suitability" for review rather than
notions of preclusive executive prerogative. In prior work, I have
addressed the scope of executive nonenforcement authority in its own
right and directly questioned the origins and validity of a supposed
preclusive nonenforcement prerogative.10 Here, I build on this account
by exploring reasons why [[executive **enforcement**]{.mark}
**obligations**]{.underline} may nonetheless [[defy]{.mark} complete
[judicial elaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, although
[courts]{.underline} have often [invoked]{.underline} notions of
[Article II]{.underline} prerogative [to justify their **passivity**
with respect to **nonenforcement**]{.underline},11 I argue that
[institutional **[limit]{.mark}ation[s on
courts]{.mark}**]{.underline}---limitations [[with]{.mark} a **broader
[resonance]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} constitutional and
**[admin]{.mark}istrative [law]{.mark}**
doctrines]{.underline}---[[provide]{.mark} a]{.underline} cogent
descriptive and normative [[justification for]{.mark} **judicial
[deference]{.mark}** to executive nonenforcement]{.underline}.

The Constitution by its terms obligates the President to "take Care that
the Laws be faithfully executed."12 Yet [courts confront]{.underline}
very real [practical and **institutional challenges** in
ensuring]{.underline} faithful [execution of]{.underline} prohibitory
[statutes by enforcement officials]{.underline}. To begin with,
[[directly **compelling** a]{.mark}n **enforcement [suit]{.mark}** [in
**any**]{.mark} **particular [case]{.mark}** [would raise]{.mark}
**acute [s]{.mark}**eparation-**[o]{.mark}**f-**[p]{.mark}**owers
[concerns, as it]{.mark} would [**collapse** the]{.mark}
**constitutional [separation]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} judicial and
executive [power]{.mark}]{.underline} and compromise the court's
neutrality in adjudicating the resulting lawsuit. Beyond this particular
formal problem, moreover, insofar as enforcement officials must pick and
choose between cases because they cannot do everything, courts will
rarely have objective benchmarks for assessing whether enforcement
agencies are focusing on the right priorities, or indeed whether they
are genuinely doing their best at all. [[The]{.mark} upshot is that
[**exercise** of executive]{.mark} **non[enforcement]{.mark}
authority**, like]{.underline} certain [other core executive functions,
[is]{.mark} effectively [a **political question**]{.mark}]{.underline},
in the peculiar sense of [the "political question
doctrine"]{.underline}---it is an area where institutional limitations
on courts [place a gap between what executive officials
ideally]{.underline} should [do and what courts will require from
them]{.underline}. What is more, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} twin
[[criteria]{.underline}]{.mark} used [to identify political
questions]{.underline} more generally, "textual assignment" to a
political branch and absence of "judicially manageable standards,"13
[[provide]{.mark} **key [guideposts]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the
[**limits** on]{.mark} **judicial [power]{.mark}** over executive
enforcement. [Bringing]{.mark} **enforcement [suits]{.mark}** and
**prosecutions**]{.underline} in particular cases [[is a]{.mark}
textually assigned [function of the executive]{.mark} branch, while the
**broader executive task** of]{.underline} setting priorities for
[enforcement]{.underline} frequently [presents [a **judicially
unmanageable** inquiry]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In sum, it is apparent that the [**[p]{.mark}**olitical
**[q]{.mark}**uestion **[d]{.mark}**octrine]{.underline} remains a
[[viable tool for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[lower]{.mark} federal
[courts to avoid]{.mark}]{.underline} reaching the merits of [[cases
that challenge]{.mark} **national security** and **[foreign
policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This continued use
[[reinforces]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[judicial]{.mark} branch's**
[deferent]{.mark}ial]{.underline} nature to the political branches of
government. [Additionally]{.underline}, in three of the four cases
discussed above, [the [US **S**]{.mark}upreme **[C]{.mark}**ourt later
**[denied certiorari]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While this does not show
explicit support by the Supreme Court for these rulings, it illustrates
how vehicles for abolishing the use of the political question doctrine
have been available. Therefore, while the Court may have decreased its
reliance on this doctrine, it has not attempted to instruct the [[lower
courts]{.underline}]{.mark} to do so; they [[continue to **apply
this**]{.mark} **threshold**]{.underline} issue [[to cases
involving]{.mark} questions of [national security]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As a result, the [**[p]{.mark}**olitical **[q]{.mark}**uestion

No, [Trump]{.underline} was [not the first president to
raise]{.underline} these [concerns]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} he is
[unlikely to be the last]{.underline}. [We must change]{.underline} the
[underlying policy that gives presidents]{.underline} this **[godlike
power]{.underline}**. We must end --- for all [presidents]{.underline}
to come --- the policy that gives them [sole authority to launch even if
we have **not been attacked**]{.underline}.

This [is an **existential issue** for the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} that deserves the highest attention from the new
administration and Congress. Here is what we must do:

First, we must prohibit the "first use" of nuclear weapons --- meaning
we would declare that we would only use nuclear weapons in response to a
nuclear attack. We would all rest easier today if we knew that Trump
could only legally order the use of nuclear weapons in retaliation to a
confirmed nuclear attack. There would be no chance, say, of him using
his last days in office to end his "maximum pressure" campaign against
Iran by dropping a few atomic bombs that could kill millions.

President Joe Biden has said that he supports a declaration that the
sole purpose of nuclear weapons is to deter their use by others. This is
a sensible position, and such a policy could also be designed to
prohibit [first use]{.underline}, including [preemptive nuclear attacks
and **l**aunches **o**n **w**arning of attack]{.underline}. These
scenarios **[dangerously increase]{.underline}** the [risk of starting
nuclear war by mistake]{.underline}.

Some argue that prohibiting first use would undermine deterrence. Not
so. Deterrence rests on our unquestioned ability to retaliate to a
nuclear attack. The United States possesses the capability to retaliate
even after being hit because of our nuclear-armed submarines hidden
under the oceans. Any nuclear strike against the United States would be
suicide for the attacker, as a massive U.S. retaliation would surely
follow.

In addition to preventing an [unhinged president]{.underline} from
[going nuclear]{.underline}, [prohibiting first use]{.underline} would
[also help]{.underline} us [avoid **accidentally blundering** into
nuclear war]{.underline}. [**E**arly **w**arning
**s**ystems]{.underline} are [vulnerable to false alarms]{.underline},
and cyberthreats to our nuclear systems are increasing. A quick decision
to use nuclear weapons only increases that chance that nukes could be
launched in response to a false alarm --- [**essentially starting** a
nuclear war by mistake]{.underline}. We should do everything in our
power to avoid such a nightmare.

Trump's agenda strayed from the norm, but his use of executive power did
not. [Presidents]{.underline} have [dominated U.S. foreign policy
decision-making since **well before** Trump]{.underline}. In fact,
[stru**ctural changes**]{.underline} began to [warp]{.underline} the
[separation of powers]{.underline}, [allowing presidents **tremendous
leeway**]{.underline}, more than 75 years ago. At first, those changes
were difficult to enact: all three branches had to deny Congress the
coequal status that the Constitution clearly confers on it. Congress
made many efforts to guard the power it enjoyed during the first 150
years of the republic, but the altered relationship eventually became
routine. By the twenty-first century, the branches had firmly
established a new relationship: executives prosecute wars unilaterally,
Congress provides little more than a fig-leaf of authorization (if any
at all), and the courts rarely interfere. [An accountable
presidency]{.underline} attuned to the interests of the American people
[requires]{.underline} a legislature capable of **[restricting executive
independence]{.underline}** --- and voters who insist on it.

ABANDONING CONSTRAINT

President George Washington never engaged in a military operation
without prior congressional approval. In 1793, he proclaimed U.S.
neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars and ran up against
principled resistance: James Madison argued that by declaring a state of
peace, Washington had encroached on Congress's power to declare war. The
modern reader might wonder how, then, U.S. presidents since Harry Truman
have managed to initiate full-scale wars with limited, if any, input
from Congress.

The norm did not change right away or all at once. During his own
presidency, Madison refrained from preparing for the War of 1812 until
Congress had passed a declaration of war. James Polk appealed to
Congress for funds and troops in order to prosecute the Mexican-American
War. Congress was so powerful in 1898 that it all but forced William
McKinley to start the Spanish-American War. Woodrow Wilson and Franklin
Roosevelt each tried to get the United States into World War I and World
War II respectively, but in both cases, Congress refused. It
reconsidered its position only in response to the shocks of the sinking
of the Lusitania and the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The attack on Pearl Harbor was, in fact, the catalyst not only for
pulling the United States into World War II but also for fundamentally
altering the separation of powers. Some members of Congress, especially
in the Senate, had viewed the United States as a continental fortress,
untouchable by the fighting in Europe or in the Pacific. Pearl Harbor
shattered this worldview by proving that a resourceful enemy could harm
the United States. Congress declared war and provided FDR with all of
the appropriations he desired, giving the following instructions: "the
President is hereby authorized and directed to employ the entire naval
and military forces of the United States and the resources of the
Government to carry on war against the Imperial Government of Japan, and
to bring the conflict to a successful termination, all of the resources
of the country are hereby pledged by the Congress of the United States."

Although the declaration appears to confer a great deal of power on the
president, it also implies significant constraint. Only Congress could
authorize the president to start a war, only Congress could permit the
president to spill blood and use treasure, and Congress defined the
enemy --- "the Imperial Government of Japan," as opposed to the Japanese
nation or any particular people. The president then used this
declaration and those that followed against other World War II enemies
to assert broad powers in carrying out the war. Members of Congress
tried to avoid questioning the president's decisions, and the public
largely supported them, showing unity even in the darkest days of the
war.

Such unity was normal in an existential crisis such as World War II, and
the constitutional structure could accommodate this consolidation of
immense power in the hands of the president. But once the Allies
declared victory, first in Europe and later in the Pacific, Congress
should have reasserted its coequal status and reclaimed its powers. Such
had been the course after every prior conflict --- so much so, in fact,
that at the end of World War I, the Senate refused to pass Wilson's
League of Nations treaty, citing the concern that Congress, and not an
international body, should retain exclusive control over when and where
the United States went to war.

After World War II, however, those concerns apparently evaporated or
were superseded. The Senate quickly and easily passed the UN and the
NATO treaties --- both of which gave other countries the ability to
force the United States into conflict. Amid the wreckage of the war,
from which the United States had emerged a superpower, members of the
Senate did not see or did not care to acknowledge how much control they
were ceding to international institutions, as they worried more perhaps
about stopping another great-power war than about protecting their
constitutional authority.

The provisions of those treaties were quickly put to the test: in 1950,
the UN Security Council issued resolutions calling for member states to
defend South Korea against North Korean aggression. Truman, unlike his
predecessors, found himself in a position to make the decision without
asking permission from Congress. With a large standing army at his
disposal and the Soviet enemy at his back, [Truman]{.underline} felt
compelled to act, and he [acted **impulsively**]{.underline}.

The [Korean War demonstrates how important **congressional
checks**]{.underline} on presidential action can be. Had Truman needed
to appeal to Congress, he would have had to prove the legitimacy of the
operation to the American people, and Congress could have used
[oversight]{.underline} to [ensure **accountability**]{.underline}
throughout the operation. Furthermore, Americans could hold members of
Congress accountable when the war took a bad turn (as most wars do). But
Truman acted on his own, leaving Congress with limited ability to
constrain him. For if Congress does not assert control at the beginning
of a war, it can use its powers only to draw down troops in dire
circumstances. After all, once the military is in the field, [members of
Congress look **unpatriotic** if they fail to provide
fighting]{.underline} men and women [with]{.underline} the [equipment
they need]{.underline} to succeed.

Such was the case in [Vietnam]{.underline}. Congress never declared war
there --- if it had, it might then have exercised some oversight over
the conflict. But in 1964, President Lyndon Johnson pressed Congress to
pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which authorized what he fancifully
promised would be a limited engagement. With that legislation,
[Congress]{.underline} now [found itself allowing the **undeclared war**
in Vietnam to escalate at]{.underline} the [**president's discretion**
rather than holding]{.underline} the [executive
accountable]{.underline}. After nearly a decade of fighting, the deaths
of tens of thousands of soldiers, and no victory in sight, Congress
attempted to reassert itself in 1973, passing the War Powers Resolution
(WPR) over President Richard Nixon's veto.

On its face, the WPR appeared to require the president to consult the
legislature before and throughout foreign conflicts. But what looked
like a reassertion of the separation of powers instead came to function
as a form of permission. The WPR clearly stipulated that in the absence
of an attack against the United States, a president could not commit
American troops without first securing a declaration of war or a
statutory authorization from Congress. The WPR went on, however, to say
that the [president]{.underline} might [initiate operations unilaterally
**so long**]{.underline} as he concluded them within 60 days and drew
down troops within another 30 days. [Presidents]{.underline} have [used
this]{.underline} language [to justify **small-scale operations** ever
since]{.underline}, including some that [have **grown larger** and
costlier]{.underline} than advertised, [such as]{.underline} those [in
**Kosovo** and **Libya**]{.underline}.

### ! --- Biden --- Korea

#### Data suggests that Biden will escalate wars with North Korea.

University of Bath, United Kingdom; August 20, 2020; "Would Biden's
Moral Interventionism Be Good for Peace in Korea?"; *National Interest*;

//CYang

Here's what some of the [[**data** suggest]{.underline}]{.mark}

Presidents of the United States are not the sole authors of the American
foreign policy. Once in power, they tend to change foreign policies less
drastically than their presidential campaigns would suggest. Joe
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}, if elected, [would be [more]{.mark}
moralistic]{.underline}, **[more
[interventionist]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} his
[North [Korea policies]{.mark}]{.underline} would be [[less interested
in]{.underline}]{.mark} merely "[[getting along]{.underline}]{.mark}"
[[with **Kim**]{.mark} **Jong-un**]{.underline}. Yet the transition from
Trump to Biden, if it happens, may not change everything.

Biden's approach to North Korea as President can be predicted based on
his vice-presidential record. [[He]{.mark} has been]{.underline} a
[[**strong supporter** of]{.underline}]{.mark} President Barack
[[Obama's]{.underline}]{.mark} normative approach to foreign policies:
atrocity crimes of terrorists and dictators need to be resisted even if
it is not in the direct self-interest of the United States.
Consequently, the Obama-Biden foreign policy brought America to
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark} against terrorists and dictators [[in
Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark} in December 2009, in
[[Libya]{.underline}]{.mark} in March 2011 and August 2016, in
[[Mali]{.underline}]{.mark} in January 2013, and in
[[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} in August
2014. Furthermore, campaigns against terrorists in
[[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Somalia]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} were intensified during the Obama-Biden
administration and a proxy war was launched against Syria's dictator
even before the campaign against the country's terrorists.
[Reviewing]{.underline} the **[statistics]{.underline}** from the
Uppsala Conflict Data Program's Georeferenced Event Database, [one can
see]{.underline} that the [number of fatalities in U.S. [wars
increased]{.mark}]{.underline} from the last year of President George W.
Bush's administration to the last year of the Obama-Biden administration
[[by **496%**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as illustrated in the graph below.
Despite the humanitarian aims, more civilians died in countries where
the United States participated in war.

While Trump has not, despite his several promises and declarations,
brought American troops home from moralistic wars, he has de-intensified
them. The number of fatalities in American conflicts has declined from
2016 to 2019 by 44%, as illustrated in the graph below. Only in
Afghanistan have fatalities continued to increase dramatically. Yet even
there, after the U.S.-Taliban Peace Agreement of February 29, 2020, the
number of U.S. fatalities has decreased.

In North Korea, Trump has not managed to bring Kim Jong-un to justice or
destroy his nuclear weapons capacity. Instead, Trump has focused on
getting along with Kim Jong-un. While this seems insufficient, only by
improving the relationship can the United States reduce Pyongyang's
fears that, according to South Korea's presidential advisor Moon
Chung-in, partly motivates the North Korean build-up of nuclear weapons.

While it would be easy to sympathize with Biden's moral aims to change
North Korea and the rest of the world, the fact is that the
[**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is [not in]{.mark}]{.underline}
a [**legitimate [position]{.mark}** [to change]{.mark} other
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Trying to do so]{.underline} tends to
[escalate]{.underline} rather than de-escalate [violence]{.underline} in
the world as the record of the Obama-Biden administration shows.
Furthermore, illegitimate [moralistic [efforts at regime
change]{.mark}]{.underline} may indeed [[support **Kim**]{.mark}
**Jong-un's dictatorship**]{.underline}. [When North Korea is threatened
by foreign powers]{.underline}, [its dictatorial efforts]{.underline} to
tamp down dissidence [are easier to justify]{.underline}. Thus, a
[[Biden]{.mark} presidency]{.underline} would be [[bad for
**peace**]{.mark} **in Korea**]{.underline}.

Beyond the significant technical hurdles, **[[an attempted preventive
strike]{.underline}]{.mark}** against North Korea **[[may
inci]{.underline}]{.mark}**te the **[[escalation
dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}** it intends to prevent. [[To function
effectively, such a strike must be conducted with]{.underline}]{.mark}
the utmost [[secrecy]{.underline}]{.mark}, so as to catch North Korea
unawares. [While North Korea may be able to glean information of a
possible U.S. military buildup from public sources]{.underline}, [[the
primitive nature of its reconnaissance]{.mark} system [serves only to
heighten]{.mark} North Korean [anxiety of an impending
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the North Korean leadership,
[**[U]{.mark}**.S. public statements intimating a policy of regime
change]{.underline} or planned military exercises on the Korean
peninsula [may well fuel fears of an imminent attack and strengthen
further the **[hair-trigger posture of the No]{.mark}rth**
**[Ko]{.mark}**rean [military]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Indeed, **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea **[[may seek to preempt an attack
or]{.underline}]{.mark}** otherwise
**[[retaliate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This spiral from a sharp, limited
strike to all-out war is easy to envision]{.underline}. North Korean
doctrine is thought to call for "automatic, reciprocal violence" in an
attempt to maintain escalation dominance. [North Korea could exercise
its long-held conventional deterrent against Seoul through a devastating
artillery bombardment of the city. To counteract this threat, the United
States would need to balance the need to find and eliminate the North
Korean leadership or missile systems with the demanding task of
eliminating North Korean artillery pieces along the mountainous
DMZ]{.underline}. This would place intense requirements upon U.S.
intelligence and strike assets, as well as an already limited munitions
supply. In addition to exercising its conventional escalatory
capabilities, [[the need to preempt an American preventive strike
generates significant press]{.mark}ures upon North Korea's nuclear
doctrine]{.underline}. As North Korean has not yet perfected a
survivable nuclear capability, some analysis argues that its nuclear
doctrine calls for a "demonstration" strike against an American military
base in the region, followed by an explicit threat to target the
continental United States. Worse still, [**[No]{.mark}**rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea, seeing little to lose, [may attempt to preemptively
strike an allied]{.mark} or American [city]{.mark} with a nuclear
ballistic missile]{.underline}. Though some, including President Trump,
hold high confidence in U.S. ballistic missile defense capabilities to
sufficiently offset North Korea's nuclear threat, this conviction
nonetheless rests upon a relatively unproven technology that offers odds
"as good as a coin toss."

The trends provoke fears that the waning US hegemon is destroying the
international system that has kept the world more stable since 1945,
while catapulting the plight of racial, ethnic and religious minorities
into particularly sharp focus. Yet, [while the [US]{.mark} has withdrawn
from multilateral institutions and endorsed isolationist]{.underline}
("America first") [rhetoric]{.underline}, [the Pentagon's military
footprint remains [outstretched in **every corner** of the
globe]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [US]{.underline} is still [engaged in
**[decades]{.mark}-long wars** [in Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile, in 2016, the [president
ordered]{.underline} a [cruise missile attack on
[Syria]{.mark}n]{.underline} government forces [without congressional
approval or **legal justification**]{.underline}; continued support for
the Saudi-led coalition's war in [[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark} that has
fueled one of the world's worst humanitarian crises; and issued [threats
of]{.underline} "[fire and fury]{.underline}" [against
**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea [raising]{.mark} the **alarming
[prospect]{.mark}** [of nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cold War-era
arrangements [empowering presidents to]{.underline} identify and
eliminate threats by [deploying the nation's **vast military
arsenals**]{.underline}, its invasive intelligence apparatus and even
its nuclear stockpiles have faced little meaningful or sustained
challenge from either political party.2

While the 2016 election has hastened and highlighted the erosion of
liberal democratic norms, [this [slippage]{.mark} is **[not]{.mark}
simply** the [result of]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[particular]{.mark}
election]{.underline}**, [[administration]{.underline}]{.mark}, [policy
or program]{.underline}. Rather, [US [presidents]{.mark}]{.underline}
since World War II have promoted democracy, open markets and free trade
by [[wielding **gargantuan**]{.mark} **military
[arsenals]{.mark}**]{.underline} and undertaking widespread surveillance
of ordinary citizens. Many historians and legal scholars argue that the
Cold War era gave rise to a [[permanent]{.underline}]{.mark} "[state of
**[executive exception]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [to]{.underline} the
[normal constitutional order]{.underline} --- thus
[[signify]{.mark}ing]{.underline} the [nation's **sustained
[deviation]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the **[r]{.mark}**ule **[o]{.mark}**f
**[l]{.mark}**aw]{.underline}, [civil liberties [and **h**]{.mark}uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights in national security realms]{.underline}.3 What is
unprecedented today, then, is not so much the betrayal of liberal norms,
but rather the degree to which liberal discourse has yielded to tacit
and explicit support for authoritarian tactics and the extent to which
liberal democratic principles, institutions and values are
simultaneously being abandoned by large parts of the American
population.4

To reflect on the [decline of American influence in the geopolitical
sphere]{.underline}, its [[internal fracturing]{.mark} and
[polarization]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[atrophying commitment to]{.mark}
**liberal democratic [values]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **persistent
[tendency]{.mark}** [to confront]{.mark} global [conflicts with
**military solutions** raises]{.mark} **crucial [questions]{.mark}**
[about whether]{.mark} American [empire is
**sustainable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and whether it is in fact worth
sustaining.5 First, how is it that a [nation]{.underline} founded on
liberal principles such as checks and balances, limited powers and
individual rights has come to [embrace]{.underline} its opposite ---
that is, virtually [**[unbounded executive]{.mark} authority** to stamp
out security threats without regard for legal and ethical
limitations]{.underline}? Second, what does an [**executive
[monopoly]{.mark}** [on]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**[militarized]{.mark}**
national security [state]{.mark}]{.underline} portend for liberal
democratic institutions in an increasingly polarized, fragmented and
unstable political climate?

In *The American Warfare State*, I argue that the nation's unprecedented
military mobilization during World War II created new political and
economic interests in military spending and war that constitutional
framers did not anticipate.6 I found that, in subsequent decades, large
defense budgets were not only a response to heightened national security
concerns, but also an integral component of many local and regional
economies --- particularly in geographically remote areas that lack
diverse economies. Meanwhile, the public burdens historically associated
with large military establishments and warfare shifted onto a small
minority of military volunteers, future generations of taxpayers who
will inherit the nation's war debts and foreign populations where US
wars take place. These new arrangements encourage legislators to support
large defense budgets, while freeing presidents to launch military
actions without congressional authorization or democratic deliberation
--- an outcome that the constitutional framers feared and tried to
prevent.

In this essay I build on the argument advanced in The American Warfare
State: I suggest that a constitutional framework built on liberal
principles like separation of powers and democratic accountability has
failed to reliably limit power or uphold the rule of law --- and that
evidence of the tilt toward a more authoritarian alternative has been
apparent for many decades. Although previous administrations upheld
verbal affirmations of liberal democratic norms, neither discourse nor
institutional procedures alone guarantee fidelity to human rights and
legal imperatives --- at least not without a more robust commitment to
these ideals and a political environment where "law is valued as
principle rather than tactic."7

To make this case, I document [[patterns of]{.mark} **executive
[lawlessness]{.mark}** in]{.underline} the conduct of national security
policy, with a particular emphasis on [military interrogations and
targeted killings in]{.underline} the George W. [Bush and]{.underline}
Barack [Obama]{.underline} administrations. Though I emphasize
twenty-first century practices, these [precedents [are **not
new**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, since Congress authorized a national
security apparatus in 1947 and provided new financial incentives to
maintain a permanent military-industrial base, both real and
[[perceived]{.mark} security [threats]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[[rationalized]{.mark} the use of force and re[lax]{.mark}ed moral and
**legal [standards]{.mark}** that]{.underline} may [otherwise
**constrain executive conduct**]{.underline}. Moreover, the [rise of a
national security state]{.underline} equipped to [kill suspects
**anywhere in the world** and cipher intelligence through extra-legal
channels]{.underline} developed democratically and with little coherent
resistance. Far from "ambition\... counteracting ambition," the
different branches and levels of government have come to perceive
mutually overlapping interests in expanding the national security state,
swelling executive prerogative, and pursuing foreign policy through
martial means.8

As a result, an [executive monopoly over]{.underline} a **[heavily
militarized]{.underline}**, [clandestine national security
establishment]{.underline} is [routinely deployed without regard for
human rights]{.underline}, civil liberties [or nation-state
sovereignt]{.underline}y. The consequences today, in an especially
fraught and fragile political climate, are two-fold: First, this
arrangement [allows [presidents]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [however
[volatile]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[intemperate]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} characteristically
[[unfit]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [to pursue their [military]{.mark} and
intelligence [policies]{.mark} as they please]{.underline}, while the
most violent and degrading consequences are borne by ethnic or religious
minorities and foreign populations in countries where US security
operations take place. Second, these [practices also [**systematically
weaken** America's]{.mark} **democratic
[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [norms and values]{.underline},
[[rendering the regime]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[vulnerable to]{.mark}
**authoritarian [challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Union without waiting for the results of legislative debate.
Additionally, [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[demonstrated]{.underline} that [it can **[move
quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline} to authorize the use of military force.
[[**Three days** after September 11]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Senate
[voted [98-0]{.mark}]{.underline} to authorize the president to use
force in response to the attacks, and the House approved the measure a
few hours later (420- 1). Another four days passed before the president
signed it. The [last time Congress declared war in response
to]{.underline} an [attack on the United States]{.underline}, [it did
not take]{.underline} lawmakers [long]{.underline} to do so. The Senate
(82-0) and the House (388-1) [issued]{.underline} a [declaration of war
[**thirty-three minutes** after]{.mark}]{.underline} President Franklin
D. Roosevelt\'s \"[[Day of Infamy]{.underline}]{.mark}\" speech.
Furthermore, whatever their capacity for dynamic response, [[presidents
do not]{.mark} always [react]{.mark} to **security threats** [with
**speed** and **energy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While Yoo cleverly aligns
his position with flexibility, there is more to constructing an adaptive
foreign policy than letting the president initiate military hostilities.
Executive decisions on war that appear, in the short term, to reflect a
flexible approach may limit policy options over the long run,
constraining foreign policymakers and military planners.

[Yoo]{.underline} expresses no doubt that the president\'s capacity to
make decisions in foreign affairs and defense --- to \"consider policy
choices\" and to \"evaluate threats\" --- is \"far superior\" to
Congress\'s. That [**overstates** the case]{.underline}. Despite the
imperfections of the legislative process, it is hard to reach such an
unqualified conclusion. Seemingly [for every example where executive
decision-making works]{.underline} well, [another can be cited
exposing]{.underline} its **[deficiencies]{.underline}**. President
[John F. Kennedy\'s]{.underline} management of the [Cuban missile
crisis]{.underline}, though not without its critics, is often cited as a
classic model of decision-making in crisis. The same president\'s
handling of the [Bay of Pigs]{.underline} invasion has been roundly
criticized.

The [[assertion of]{.mark} the **[need for speed]{.mark}**]{.underline}

history, including the age of terror, [is
**[misguided]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**[dangerous]{.mark}** and
**[overrated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Objections abound. The premise ---
that presidents need to act quickly to confront emergencies generated by
terrorists, is simplistic. The president, as we have seen, possesses the
authority as commander in chief to repel invasions of the United States.
Everyone agrees with the Framers of the Constitution that if America is
attacked, there is the greatest need to defend the nation. But [[there

[[invasion]{.underline}]{.mark} of the nation [[and **initiating

[How **depraved** and **incompetent** do you have to be before
people]{.underline} in America [stop asking your opinion]{.underline}
about things? Former Bush administration Department of Justice official
[John **Yoo**]{.underline} --- the man who famously [**butchered** the
U.S. Constitution]{.underline} in order [to give the CIA the **legal
authority** to conduct **medieval torture**]{.underline} --- this week
decided to chime in with his opinion on the Pulitzer Prize being awarded
to the publications that reported the Edward Snowden leaks.
Unsurprisingly, he was not too thrilled about the decision:

> "I'm not surprised the Pulitzer committee gave The Washington Post a
> prize for pursuing a sensationalist story, even when the story is a
> disaster for its own country....I don't think we need automatically
> read the prize as a vindication for Snowden's crimes. Awarding a prize
> to a newspaper that covered a hurricane does not somehow vindicate the
> hurricane, \[and\] awarding a Pulitzer for a photo of a murder does
> not somehow vindicate the crime."

His statement is problematic for a few reasons. First, [Yoo]{.underline}
appears to have brought the same deft reasoning powers with which he
[argued it was **legally justifiable** to **crush a child's
testicles**]{.underline} to his very bizarre analysis of this event. The
papers were not --- as he apparently failed to grasp before commenting
--- awarded the Pulitzer for their reporting on Snowden's "crimes" but
rather for their reporting on the NSA's surveillance programs. That was
entirely what the award was for, as anyone who bothered looking at the
Pulitzer committee statement could plainly see. It's true that acts are
not made justified simply by being reported in the news, but the only
party to which that would be applicable in this situation is the NSA ---
not Snowden. And so, tragically, [Yoo's **elaborate
analogies**]{.underline} about hurricane vindication [are]{.underline}
slightly [undermined by the fact that they happen to make **no fucking
sense**]{.underline}.

But a more important question to ask here is, why are people asking John
Yoo's opinion about things? In what universe does it seem appropriate to
seek out a [man]{.underline} whose [actions resulted in the grievous
torture and deaths of **innumerable people**]{.underline} and ask him to
weigh in on the news of the day? [John Yoo almost **single-handedly
shredded** the U.S. Constitution]{.underline} --- to say nothing of what
he helped do to America's moral standing in the world --- and yet major
news outlets and even universities continue to regularly seek out his
advice as though he isn't an incompetent reprobate of biblical
proportions. Worse than that, [he's]{.underline} the monstrous figure
who [**knowingly enabled** the **most unconscionable** war crimes of the
global war on terror]{.underline}. [In any]{.underline} ~~sane~~ or
[just society]{.underline}, [Yoo would be rotting in a **prison cell**
instead of]{.underline} wearing tailored suits and [sharing his
opinions]{.underline} in polite company. But, alas, America as it stands
today is somewhat wanting in the departments of both ~~sanity~~ and
justice. While powerful ghouls such as Yoo completely escape legal
consequences for their actions --- no matter how morally despicable and
disastrous for the country they were --- ordinary Americans somehow
continue to regularly land in jail for the slightest transgressions. In
fact, [Yoo]{.underline} is not only not in jail, he's still somehow a
media figure regularly weighing in on the issues of the day. Legal
accountability for his moral failures aside, he [hasn't **even really
paid** a career price for the **monumental incompetence**]{.underline}
[he displayed in his work]{.underline}.

To be fair, Yoo isn't the only one in this situation who is taking
advantage of the consequence-free world of the rich and politically
connected. His fellow Iraq War criminals Karl Rove, Dick Cheney and
Donald Rumsfeld can all still be seen in the news being regularly
solicited for their commentary on various matters. They're the people
who helped kill, wound and displace millions of innocent Iraqis, tens of
thousands of American servicemen, and whose collective mismanagement
helped turned America into a giant smoldering wreckage by the time they
exited government --- but somehow they are still apparently shameless
enough to offer criticisms of other people's actions.

One can perhaps excuse these people for their lack of self-awareness.
After all, they are part of the supremely insular universe of the
wealthy and powerful where all criticism from the real world can
comfortably be papered over. But why on earth do ostensibly reputable
news organizations continue to seek out people like this --- individuals
who should rightly be awaiting their arraignments at The Hague --- for
quotations and analysis on current events? Doing so is as inexplicable
as asking Ted Kaczynski for his opinion on the 2016 presidential race,
or calling up Ratko Mladić to ask what he thinks of the Mets' chances
this year.

But perhaps the best example of America's ironclad career security for
the powerful is former Bush speechwriter David Frum. Never mind that the
childishly facile "Axis of Evil" quote that became his trademark helped
trigger a proxy war with Iran that destroyed America's imperial projects
in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and never mind his own fantastical
delusions that the Iraq War would not only be a glorious triumph but
would also end up revealing: "the flow of money from Iraq to ... French
and German corporations \[and\] senior political figures."

His spectacular moral and professional failures have somehow not harmed
Frum one bit. Far from jail or even obscurity, he's still a voice in our
national conversation. Indeed, America's very own Baghdad Bob has
remained on the airwaves consistently no matter how malevolent or
criminally incompetent he's been. Just this past month, on the 11th
anniversary of the war he helped start, Frum was named the senior editor
of the Atlantic magazine. Yet another example of America's broken
meritocracy; career security for no one except war criminals and Wall
Street raiders.

It's time to stop this. The [perversity of continuing to refer
for]{.underline} "**[expert]{.underline}**" [**opinion** to people who
not only have **consistent track records** of failure but **actual
blood** on their hands cannot continue]{.underline} if America is to
have a healthy, ~~sane~~ and productive public discourse. [No one should
care what John Yoo]{.underline} thinks about the Pulitzer Prize, just
like no one would've cared what Eichmann thought about the Bay of Pigs
invasion or the civil rights movement or "Breakfast at Tiffany's."
[People like Yoo]{.underline} and his coterie of Iraq War perpetrators
[belong in prison cells]{.underline}, [not the pages of **major
newsmagazines** or the **lecterns of universities**]{.underline}. While
we as a society may lack the power to bring these individuals to
justice, the [least we can do is stop giving their noxious views
**public airtime**]{.underline}.

**Nzelibe 11** \[Jide Nzelibe, Professor of Law, Northwestern University

MARY LAW REVIEW, Vol. 53:389. 2011\]

This Essay argues that [[politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} may sometimes
[**strategically [manipulate]{.mark}** the contours of the
**President's** constitutional **[authority]{.mark}** in order [to
achieve **partisan objectives**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [At first
glance]{.underline}, the notion that societal groups may ever stake out
conflicting visions of presidential authority seems puzzling. After all,
[it is difficult to envision how any view of presidential authority can
systematically confer one-sided benefits]{.underline} on any partisan or
interest group, because presumably each group will sometimes lose and
gain from any particular constraint on presidential authority. Thus,
given the implicit veil of ignorance that underpins the separation of
powers, one may think that the incentives of judges and elected
officials to embrace visions of presidential authority that advance the
specific objectives of any political party will be blunted.
Unsurprisingly, [much]{.underline} of the [contemporary
[scholarship]{.mark} on presidential power has **[ignored partisan
factors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and has instead focused on how
incentives **inherent** in the **institutional nature** of]{.underline}
the various [branches]{.underline} of government [shape]{.underline}
preferences for expansive [presidential authority]{.underline}.2

[This Essay suggests a **contrary view**]{.underline}: if certain
conditions hold, [[partisan power holders]{.mark} can often [calculate
how]{.mark} an **expansive or narrow** view of presidential [authority
over]{.mark} **discrete [issues]{.mark}** [is likely to affect their
electoral]{.mark} and ideological [objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. More
specifically, [staking out partisan positions on the allocation of
presidential authority is likely to be rational when such [authority can
be **unbundled**]{.mark} on an **[issue-by-issue]{.mark}
basis**]{.underline}.3 Under these conditions, [[parties]{.mark} are
likely to **[favor]{.mark}** a vision of **presidential
[authority]{.mark}** [that will **enable them** to **carry out**
]{.mark}those [**issues** in which **they have** an **electoral
advantage**]{.mark} over the opposition]{.underline}, [but that make it
**more difficult** for the **opposition** to **carry out** its favored
**issues**]{.underline}. For instance, [when]{.underline} the
presidential [[authority to negotiate]{.mark} human rights [**treaties**
can be]{.mark}]{.underline} effectively [**[unbundled]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**-[making
**[power]{.mark}**, [Republicans]{.mark} [may prefer more
**constraints**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the President's treatymaking
authority in human rights, [[but less on]{.underline}]{.mark} his
[**[war]{.mark}**-making]{.underline} authority.4 By contrast, Democrats
or left-leaning constituencies will likely adopt the opposite set of
preferences regarding presidential authority on war and human rights.
Similarly, Democratic administrations may be more willing to indulge a
greater role for courts in adjudicating human rights controversies even
at the expense of the President's interpretive discretion over
international law, whereas Republican administrations are more likely to
view such adjudications as interfering with the President's flexibility
to conduct foreign affairs.5

Pennsylvania (Michael, with Sarah Kreps and Matthew Fuhrman, "Separating
Fact from Fiction in the Debate over Drone Proliferation," International
Security, Vol. 41, No. 2 (Fall 2016), pp. 7--42, dml)

This article assesses the consequences of current-generation drone
proliferation, concluding that both of the above perspectives are
misguided. Examining the effects of UAVs in six different
contexts---counterterrorism, interstate conflict, crisis onset and
deterrence, coercive diplomacy, domestic control and repression, and use
by nonstate actors for the purposes of terrorism---we show that,
[[although]{.mark} current-generation [drones]{.mark} will [introduce
**some**]{.mark} **[unique capabilities]{.mark}** into conflicts around
the world, [they are **unlikely to produce**]{.mark} **the [dire
consequences]{.mark}** that some analysts fear]{.underline}. In
particular, drone proliferation carries potentially significant
consequences for counterterrorism operations and domestic control in
authoritarian regimes. Drones lower the costs of using force by
eliminating the risk that pilots will be killed, making some states---
especially democracies, which may be especially casualty
sensitive---more likely to carry out targeted attacks against suspected
militants. In addition, using drones could provide autocratic leaders
with a new tool to bolster their domestic regime security.8

Yet, [in general, current-generation drones [are likely to have a
**minimal impact** on interstate relations]{.mark}. Armed or advanced
unarmed drones are **[unlikely to provoke]{.mark} international
[crises]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} **incite regional
[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition, [current-generation
drones [offer **little utility for coercion**]{.mark} against other
governments]{.underline}. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, moreover,
[drones [might **enhance security** in disputed border regions by
providing]{.mark} states with a **greater [ability to monitor contested
regions]{.mark}** persistently at lower cost. Monitoring can [help to
**reassure states** that]{.mark} potential [adversaries are not
attempting to change the status quo]{.mark} through force]{.underline}.
The limited significance of current-generation drones in interstate
contexts beyond monitoring stems from a key technological limitation:
drones currently in operation are vulnerable to air defense systems, so
they are much less likely to be effective when operating in hostile
airspace.9

[With]{.underline} President-elect Donald [Trump]{.underline} poised to
become commander-in-chief, a number of [debates have arisen
about]{.underline} the legacies that will be left behind by his
predecessor and the ways those legacies shape the options available to
Trump. Last month in an interview, President Obama outlined five moments
that he believed defined his presidency. One of them involved the use of
[drones]{.underline} to track and kill suspected militants. In a world
where a U.S. president has an arsenal of drones at his or her disposal,
Obama recalled, America will soon find itself with a president who can
carry on perpetual wars all over the world, "and a lot of them covert,
without any accountability or democratic debate."

The notion that drones make it easier for leaders to use military force
has raised questions about the proliferation of drones globally, from
groups like Human Rights Watch concerned about illicit uses of force to
debates in the U.S. government about how to balance proliferation
concerns and export policy choices. Discussion of these issues is
understandable --- [the United States is perceived as having been
relatively unconstrained with its use of drones around the
world]{.underline}. President Obama stated that drones have become a
ubiquitous ingredient in our strategy for combatting counterterrorism
and are likely to remain so.

What would the world look like if drones played a similarly large role
for all modern militaries? This is an important question not just
because of the recent U.S. election -- which produced a president-elect
who will begin formulating a vision for American foreign policy -- but
also global trends.

Almost a dozen countries now have armed drones. Countries like China and
Israel have become major drone exporters. Armed drones are becoming an
increasingly mainstream capability.

[There are two major schools of thought]{.underline} on the impact of
drone proliferation. The first, primarily made up of
[skeptics]{.underline} about drone strikes outside the U.S. government,
[suggests that the consequences would be dismal]{.underline}. This view
holds that other countries would extrapolate from the U.S. experience
and be more inclined to carry out drone strikes of their own, leading to
enormous ripple effects -- especially in East Asia and the Middle East.

[Another perspective]{.underline}, however, [is]{.underline} somewhat
[more sanguine about drone proliferation. [Drones]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to this view, [[do not change]{.mark} the
[decision]{.mark}-making [calculus]{.mark} [for]{.mark} states
contemplating the use of [force]{.mark}]{.underline}. As former Director
of Central Intelligence and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated in
his memoirs

[To call our campaign against Al Qaeda a "drone program" is a little
like calling World War I a "machine gun program."]{.underline}
Technology has always been an aspect of war...what is most crucial is
not the size of the missile or the ability to deploy it from thousands
of miles away" \[but how the munitions are used\].

In a newly-published article in International Security, we evaluate
these two competing perspectives. It turns out, the reality is more
context-specific than either side in the drone debate has acknowledged.
We examine the consequences of current-generation drone proliferation in
six different contexts --- counterterrorism, interstate conflict, crisis
onset and deterrence, coercive diplomacy, domestic control and
repression, and use by non-state actors for the purposes of terrorism --
to see how the increasing use of drones might change military outcomes,
or even the global balance of power.

Counterterrorism: The operational advantages of drones, including their
precision and low risk to their operators, have made drones invaluable
to the United States for counterterrorism, and they will likely prove
useful to other countries for similar purposes. Drones are effective
here in part because regions where counterterrorism strikes are most
active, whether Gaza, the tribal regions of Pakistan, or Yemen, lack
sophisticated air defenses that are otherwise quite lethal against
drones that fly low and slow.

Interstate conflict: [[Because of]{.mark} their [vulnerability to
anti-air defenses]{.mark}, current-generation [drones are likely to have
a minimal impact on]{.mark} interstate relations (or [internationalized
disputes]{.mark}]{.underline} like the one against the Islamic State).
Indeed, as Micah Zenko and Sarah Kreps point out, [drones [will be
unable to take and hold foreign territory]{.mark} because of limits to
current drones' range, speed, and lethality]{.underline}. And because
[they, like other forms of airpower, cannot take and hold territory on
their own.]{.underline}

Crisis onset and deterrence: There are reasons to think that [drones
[could be a stabilizing force in]{.mark} some types of [border
disputes]{.mark}, especially those among interstate rivals. Drones could
[give both sides in a crisis real-time information]{.mark} about the
situation at lower cost]{.underline} than inhabited intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets -- especially for
countries without the extensive ISR capabilities of the United States --
[[and]{.mark} with [lower risk to personnel]{.mark}, than is possible at
present]{.underline}. Similarly, [drones [could decrease the ability of
potential aggressors to conduct surprise attacks]{.mark}. [With the aid
of surveillance drones]{.mark}, potential [targets may]{.mark} be more
likely to [see attacks coming and prepare accordingly]{.mark}.
Drones]{.underline}, then, [may be useful for deterrence by denial: If
the potential aggressor is dependent on the element of surprise, but
knows that drones flying near the border would give the other side
adequate notice, it may be less likely to launch an attack]{.underline}.

**Drone collisions/crashes don't escalate**

**Horowitz, et al, 16**---associate professor of political science and
associate director of Perry World House at the University of
Pennsylvania (Michael, with Sarah Kreps and Matthew Fuhrman, "Separating
Fact from Fiction in the Debate over Drone Proliferation," International
Security, Vol. 41, No. 2 (Fall 2016), pp. 7--42, dml)

The concerns outlined above certainly have merit. Still, [[it is
important not to overstate the risk]{.mark} of drone deployments for
regional or international stability]{.underline}. For example, [[none of
the]{.mark} aforementioned [incidents led to armed military
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the contrary, [emerging [norms
regarding]{.mark} the [consequences of shooting]{.mark} down [a
drone]{.mark}, though clearly still in the early stages,
[suggest]{.mark} that [states distinguish between]{.mark} the shooting
down of [manned and unmanned systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [even
if there is an accident and a drone is brought down, [it is less likely
to trigger a crisis or]{.mark} military [escalation]{.mark} than those
in the pessimistic camp imply]{.underline}. For example, [when Pakistan
shot down an Indian surveillance drone]{.underline} in the Kashmir
region in the summer of 2015 that it said strayed beyond the line of
control, [India did not escalate the long-simmering conflict to
war]{.underline}.106 Similarly, [compare the muted international
discussion when Turkey shot down a drone]{.underline} flying on its
border with Syria in the fall of 2015 [with the diplomatic crisis
between Turkey and Russia that erupted when Turkey brought down a manned
SU-24]{.underline}.107 [[Countries]{.underline}]{.mark} appear to
[[know]{.mark} that [opponents will value drones differently]{.mark}
from manned aircraft, [and behave accordingly]{.mark}. Thus, drones
carrying out surveillance and reconnaissance missions need not be
destabilizing]{.underline}. This may not always be the

**Blomquist** **10** \[Robert, spring, Valparaiso university law review,
"The Jurisprudence Of American National Security Presiprudence",
<http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&context=vulr>\]

Supreme Court [Justices]{.underline}---along with legal
advocates---[need to]{.underline} conceptualize and
[prioritize]{.underline} big theoretical matters of institutional design
and form and function in the American [national security]{.underline}
tripartite constitutional system. By way of an excellent introduction to
these vital issues of legal theory, the Justices should pull down from
the library shelf of the sumptuous Supreme Court Library in Washington,
D.C. (or more likely have a clerk do this chore) the old chestnut, The
Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law by
the late Harvard University law professors Henry M. Hart and Albert M.
Sacks.7 Among the rich insights on institutional design coupled with
form and function in the American legal system that are germane to the
Court's interpretation of national security law-making and
decision-making by the President are several pertinent points. First,
"Hart and Sacks' intellectual starting point was the interconnectedness
of human beings, and the usefulness of law in helping us coexist
peacefully together."8 By implication, therefore, [the Court should be
mindful]{.underline} [of the **unique**]{.underline} constitutional
**[role]{.underline}** [played by the POTUS \[president of the United
States\] in **preserving peace**]{.underline} [and should
prevent]{.underline} [imprudent judicial actions that would]{.underline}
**[undermine]{.underline}** American **[national
security.]{.underline}** Second, Hart and Sacks, continuing their broad
insights of social theory, noted that legal communities establish
"institutionalized\[\] procedures for the settlement of questions of
group concern"9 and regularize "different procedures and personnel of
different qualifications . . . appropriate for deciding different kinds
of questions"10 because "every modern society differentiates among
social questions, accepting one mode of decision for one kind and other
modes for others---e.g., courts for 'judicial' decisions and
legislatures for 'legislative' decisions"11 and, extending their
conceptualization, an executive for "executive" decisions.12 Third,
Professors Hart and Sacks made seminal theoretical distinctions between
rules, standards, principles, and policies.13 While all four are part of
"legal arrangements in an organized society,"14 and all four of these
arrangements are potentially relevant in [judicial review of
presidential national security decisions]{.underline}, principles and
policies15 **[are of special concern]{.underline}** [because of the
sprawling,]{.underline} inchoate, **[and rapidly changing]{.underline}**
[nature of]{.underline} national **[security threats]{.underline}** [and
the]{.underline} **[imperative]{.underline}** [of
hyper-energy]{.underline} [in the Executive]{.underline} branch **[in
responding]{.underline}** to these threats.16 The Justices should also
consult Professor Robert S. Summers's masterful elaboration and
amplification of the Hart and Sacks project on enhancing a flourishing
legal system: the 2006 opus, Form and Function in a Legal System: A
General Study. 17 The most important points that Summers makes that are
relevant to judicial review of American national security presiprudence
are three key considerations. First, a \"conception of the overall form
of the whole of a functional \[legal\] unit is needed to serve the
founding purpose of defining, specifying, and organizing the makeup of
such a unit so that it can be brought into being and can fulfill its own
distinctive role\"18 in synergy with other legal units to serve
overarching sovereign purposes for a polity. [The]{.underline} American
[constitutional system]{.underline} of national security law and policy
[should be appreciated for its]{.underline} **[genius]{.underline}** [in
making the POTUS the national security sentinel with vast,]{.underline}
but not unlimited, [powers to protect the Nation from
**hostile**]{.underline}, potentially **[catastrophic]{.underline}**,
**[threats]{.underline}**. Second, \"a conception of the overall form of
the whole is needed for the purpose of organizing the internal unify of
relations between various formal features of a functional \[legal\] unit
and between each formal feature and the complementary components of the
whole unit.\"19 Thus, Supreme Court Justices should have a thick
understanding of the form of national security decision- making
conceived by the Founders to center in the POTUS; the ways the POTUS and
Congress historically organized the processing of national security
through institutions like the National Security Council and the House
and Senate intelligence committees; and the ways the POTUS has
structured national security process through such specific legal forms
as Presidential Directives, National Security Decision Directives,
National Security Presidential Decision Directives, Presidential
Decision Directives, and National Security Policy Directives in
classified, secret documents along with typically public Executive
Orders.20 Third, according to Summers, \"a conception of the overall
form of the whole functional (legal\] unit is needed to organize further
the mode of operation and the instrumental capacity of the \[legal\]
unit.\"21 So, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Supreme [[Court should be aware
that **tinkering** with]{.underline} **[national security decisions of
the]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**POTUS** \[[president]{.mark} of the United
States\]]{.underline} ---unless clearly necessary to counterbalance an
indubitable violation of the text of the Constitution---[[may lead
to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[unforeseen [negative]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[second-order]{.underline}** **[[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[in the ability of the POTUS]{.underline} (with or without the help of
Congress) [to]{.underline} preserve, protect, and **[defend the
Nation]{.underline}**.22 \[\*886\] B. Geopolitical Strategic
Considerations Bearing on Judicial Interpretation Before the United
States Supreme Court Justices form an opinion on the legality of
national security decisions by the POTUS, they should immerse themselves
in judicially-noticeable facts concerning what national security expert,
Bruce Berkowitz, in the subtitle of his recent book, calls the
\"challengers, competitors, and threats to America\'s future.\" n23 Not
that the Justices need to become experts in national security affairs,
n24 but every Supreme Court Justice should be aware of the following
five basic national security facts and conceptions before sitting in
judgment on presiprudential national security determinations. (1)
\"[[National security]{.underline}]{.mark} policy . . . [[is
harder]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} the
issues that are involved are more numerous and varied. [[The
problem]{.underline}]{.mark} of the [day [can change at a moment\'s
notice]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" n25 While \"\[y\]esterday, it might have
been **[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration; today,
[**[terrorism]{.underline}**;]{.mark} tomorrow, **[hostile [regional
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" n26, the twenty-first century reality is
that [\"\[t\]hreats are also more likely to be
intertwined\--proliferators use the same networks as narco-traffickers,
narco-traffickers support terrorists, and terrorists align themselves
with regional powers]{.underline}.\" n27 (2) \"Yet, as worrisome as
these immediate concerns may be, the long-term challenges are even
harder to deal with, and the stakes are higher. Whereas the main Cold
War threat\--the Soviet Union\--was brittle, most of the potential
adversaries and challengers America now faces are resilient.\" n28 (3)
\"The most important task for U.S. national security today is simply to
retain the strategic advantage. This term, from the world of military
doctrine, refers to the overall ability of a nation to control, or at
least influence, the course of events.\" n29 Importantly, \"\[w\]hen you
hold \[\*887\] the strategic advantage, situations unfold in your favor,
and each round ends so that you are in an advantageous position for the
next. When you do not hold the strategic advantage, they do not.\" n30
(4) While \"keeping the strategic advantage may not have the idealistic
ring of making the world safe for democracy and does not sound as
decisively macho as maintaining American hegemony,\" n31 [maintaining
the]{.underline} American \"**[strategic advantage is
critical]{.underline}**, [because it is essential for just about
everything else America hopes to achieve]{.underline}\--promoting
freedom, protecting the homeland, defending its values, **[preserving
peace]{.underline}**, and so on.\" n32 (5) **[[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[requires national security \"agility]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" n33
It not only needs \"to refocus its resources repeatedly; it needs to do
this faster than an adversary can focus its own resources.\" n34
\[\*888\] As further serious preparation for engaging in the
jurisprudence of American national security presiprudence in hotly
contested cases and controversies that may end up on their docket, our
Supreme Court Justices should understand that, as Walter Russell Mead
pointed out in an important essay a few years ago, n35 the average
American can be understood as a Jacksonian pragmatist on national
security issues. n36 \"Americans are determined to keep the world at a
distance, while not isolating ourselves from it completely. If we need
to take action abroad, we want to do it on our terms.\" n37 Thus, recent
social science survey data paints \"a picture of a country whose
practical people take a practical approach to knowledge about national
security. Americans do not bother with the details most of the time
because, for most Americans, the details do not matter most the time.\"
n38 Indeed, since the American people \"do know the outlines of the big
picture and what we need to worry about \[in national security affairs\]
so we know when we need to pay greater attention and what is at stake.
This is the kind of knowledge suited to a Jacksonian.\" n39 Turning to
how the Supreme Court should view and interpret American presidential
measures to oversee national security law and policy, our Justices
should consider a number of important points. First, given the robust
text, tradition, intellectual history, and evolution of the institution
of the POTUS as the American national security sentinel, n40 and the
unprecedented dangers to the United States national security after 9/11,
n41 [national security presiprudence should be accorded **wide
latitude** by the Court]{.underline} in the adjustment (and tradeoffs)
of trading liberty and security. n42 Second, Justices should be aware
that different presidents \[\*889\] institute changes in national
security presiprudence given their unique perspective and knowledge of
threats to the Nation. n43 Third, **[[Justices should be restrained in
second-guessing the]{.mark} POTUS \[[president]{.mark} of the United
States\]]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} his subordinate [national
security experts]{.underline} concerning both the existence and duration
of national security emergencies and necessary measures to rectify them.
\"[During emergencies, the institutional advantages of the executive are
enhanced]{.underline}\", n44 moreover, \"\[[[b\]ecause of the importance
of]{.underline} **[secrecy, speed, and flexibility]{.underline}**,
**[courts, which are slow]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, open, [and
rigid]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [have less to
contribute]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the formulation of national policy
than they do during normal times]{.underline}.\" n45 Fourth, Supreme
Court Justices, of course, should not give the POTUS a blank
check\--even during times of claimed national emergency; but, how much
deference to be accorded by the Court is \"always a hard question\" and
should be a function of \"the scale and type of the emergency.\" n46
Fifth, [the [Court should be]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[extraordinarily
deferential]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to the POTUS]{.underline} and his
executive subordinates [regarding]{.underline} questions of [executive
determinations]{.underline} [of the international laws of war and
military tactics]{.underline}. As cogently explained by Professors Eric
Posner and Adrian Vermeule, n47 \"the United States should comply with
the laws of war in its battle against Al Qaeda\"\--and I would argue,
other lawless terrorist groups like the Taliban\--\"only to the extent
these laws are beneficial to the United States, taking into account the
likely response of \[\*890\] other states and of al Qaeda and other
terrorist organizations,\" n48 as determined by the POTUS and his
national security executive subordinates.

Strike Was Constitutional\", National Review,

[[Our Constitution]{.mark} has **succeeded**]{.underline} [because it
[favors **swift presidential action in war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, later
checked by Congress's funding power. If a president continues to wage
war without congressional authorization, as in Libya, Kosovo, or Korea,
it is only because Congress has chosen not to exercise its easy check.
We should not confuse a desire to escape political responsibility for a
defect in the Constitution. [[A **radical change**]{.mark} **in the
system**]{.underline} [for making war might appease critics of
presidential power]{.underline}. [But it [could]{.mark} also
**[seriously threaten American national security]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[In order [to **forestall another 9/11**]{.mark}]{.underline} attack,
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} [take advantage of a window of opportunity to
[**strike terrorists** or **rogue nations**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the
executive]{.mark} branch [needs **flexibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[It is not hard to think of situations where congressional consent
cannot be obtained in time to act]{.underline}. [Time for congressional
[deliberation]{.mark}]{.underline}, which can lead to passivity and
isolation and not smarter decisions, [[will come at the price of
**speed** and **secrecy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Constitution creates
a presidency that can respond forcefully to prevent serious threats to
our national security. [Presidents can take the initiative]{.underline},
[and Congress can use its funding power to check
presidents]{.underline}. [Instead of demanding a **legalistic
process**]{.underline} to begin war, [the Framers left war to
politics]{.underline}. [[As we confront]{.mark} the new challenges
of]{.underline} [**[terrorism]{.underline}**, **[rogue

#### 4^th^ generation conflicts outweigh

**Gable 11** \[William R., Associate Professor of Political Science at
the University of Michigan, March 14, 2011, Strategy Research Project,
AN ERA OF PERSISTENT CONFLICT\]

[Exceptional individuals are key contributors to the turmoil the U.S.
experienced in the last decade]{.underline} through the present, and
[their objectives could portend continued conflict.]{.underline} While
the existence of these exceptional individuals alone does not
necessarily assure conflict, [the [ideologies]{.mark} they espouse [are
underpinned by religion adding a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[nondeterrable]{.underline}** **[dimension]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to
their struggle]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} actual or **[perceived
preponderance]{.underline}** [of U.S. power will not diminish the
likelihood of future attacks]{.underline}. In fact, such attacks will
only serve to enhance these organizations' status and power, fueling
every aspect of their operations from recruiting to financing
operations. Consequently, [threats from non-state actors will
continue]{.underline}. Depending on the potential destruction inflicted
by any terrorist attack, the attacker's sanctuary, and the threat posed
to the aforementioned governments, the U.S. may be compelled to fight
wars similar to the war in Afghanistan. [[Conflict with another state
is]{.underline}]{.mark} possible, though [**[less
likely]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Although the relative decline of U.S.
economic power in relation to China appears to constitute a
potential]{.underline} ―window‖ or [threat]{.underline} to peace, [both
governments are aware of the **risks** and are **working to mitigate**
them.]{.underline} Moreover, [[the U.S., China, and Russia represent
**deterrable nuclear powers**]{.mark},]{.underline} states dissuaded
from conflict with each other due to the potential costs of a nuclear
exchange. [Conflict between these states appears unlikely]{.underline}.
However, [[existing theory suggests **problems with nondeterrable
states**]{.mark} that are not responsive to punishment or are willing to
take risks that prompt conflict. [North Korea]{.mark} and [Iran]{.mark}
seem to fit this description.]{.underline} [Their [efforts to]{.mark}
develop]{.underline}, acquire, [and]{.underline} possibly [[proliferate
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [combined with]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the
potential threat posed by a **non-state actor**]{.mark} acquiring such
weapons,]{.underline} [form conditions that indicate a strong
possibility of war.]{.underline} In particular, Iran's nuclear program
presents a potentially ominous window. Should diplomacy, sanctions, and
cyber attacks fail to sidetrack Iran's nuclear program, [the U.S. will
be presented with an ever-narrowing window to act with
force]{.underline} to deny Iran this capability. This could result in
conflict with Iran. While false optimism is a potent and pervasive cause
of war, [recent experience with war and the nature of these and likely
future conflicts will diminish leaders support for initiating
war.]{.underline} Similarly, [the current economic conditions and
concern over the national debt will dampen leaders' enthusiasm for
wars]{.underline}. But [existing theories that discuss these factors
fail to consider the impact of non-state actors]{.underline}.
[Thus]{.underline}, **[conflict is still possible despite
them.]{.underline}** Overall, [the combination of factors seems to
indicate]{.underline} [continuing conflict with nonstate
actors]{.underline} [and]{.underline} potential [conflict with states
over]{.underline} development and **[proliferation]{.underline}** of
nuclear weapons. [[These factors]{.mark} identify specific circumstances
where U.S. involvement in war is likely, and [represent
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[primary drivers]{.underline}**]{.mark} for
concluding that the current era will be one
[**[of]{.mark}**]{.underline} persistent
**[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The U.S. government should use all
of the elements of power to focus on these factors to prevent what
history and theory suggest the inevitability of war.

#### Bioterror causes extinction

**Mhyvold 13** \[Nathan, doctorate in theoretical and mathematical
physics and a master\'s degree in mathematical economics from Princeton
University; founded Intellectual Ventures after retiring from his
position as chief strategist and chief technology officer of Microsoft,

As horrible as this would be, such a pandemic is by no means the worst
attack one can imagine, for several reasons. First, [most]{.underline}
of the [[classic bioweapons are based on]{.underline}]{.mark} 1960s and
[[1970s tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology because the 1972 treaty halted
bioweapons development efforts in the United States and most other
Western countries. Second, the Russians, although solidly committed to
biological weapons long after the treaty deadline, were never on the
cutting edge of biological research. Third and most important, [the
science]{.underline} and technology [of [molecular bio]{.mark}logy have
[made enormous advances]{.mark}]{.underline}, utterly **[[transforming
the field]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the last few decades. High school
biology students routinely perform molecular-biology manipulations that
would have been impossible even for the best superpower-funded program
back in the heyday of biological-weapons research. The biowarfare
methods of the 1960s and 1970s are now as antiquated as the lumbering
mainframe computers of that era. [Tomorrow's [terrorists will have
vastly more deadly bugs]{.mark} to choose from]{.underline}. Consider
this sobering development: in 2001, Australian researchers working on
Mousepox, a nonlethal virus that infects mice (as chickenpox does in
humans), accidentally discovered that a simple genetic modification
transformed the virus.10, 11 instead of producing mild symptoms, the new
virus killed 60% of even those mice already immune to the naturally
occurring strains of Mousepox. The new virus, moreover, was unaffected
by any existing vaccine or antiviral drug. a team of researchers at
saint Louis University led by mark Buller picked up on that work and, by
late 2003, found a way to improve on it: Buller's variation on Mousepox
was 100% lethal, although his team of investigators also devised
combination vaccine and antiviral therapies that were partially
effective in protecting animals from the engineered strain.12, 13
Another saving grace is that the genetically altered virus is no longer
contagious. Of course, it is quite possible that future tinkering with
the virus will change that property, too. Strong reasons exist to
believe that the genetic modifications Buller made to Mousepox would
work for other poxviruses and possibly for other classes of viruses as
well. Might the same techniques allow chickenpox or another poxvirus
that infects humans to be turned into a 100% lethal bioweapon, perhaps
one that is resistant to any known antiviral therapy? I've asked this
question of experts many times, and no one has yet replied that such a
manipulation couldn't be done. This case is just one example. Many more
are pouring out of scientific journals and conferences every year. Just
last year, the journal Nature published a controversial study done at
the University of Wisconsin--Madison in which virologists enumerated the
changes one would need to make to a highly lethal strain of bird flu to
make it easily transmitted from one mammal to another.14
[[Biotech]{.mark}nology [is advancing so rapidly that it is hard to keep
track of]{.mark} all the new [potential threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Nor is it clear that anyone is even trying. In addition to lethality and
drug resistance, many other parameters can be played with, given that
the infectious power of an epidemic depends on many properties,
including the length of the latency period during which a person is
contagious but asymptomatic. Delaying the onset of serious symptoms
allows each new case to spread to more people and thus makes the virus
harder to stop. This dynamic is perhaps best illustrated by hiv, which
is very difficult to transmit compared with smallpox and many other
viruses. Intimate contact is needed, and even then, the infection rate
is low. The balancing factor is that hiv can take years to progress to
aids, which can then take many more years to kill the victim. What makes
hiv so dangerous is that infected people have lots of opportunities to
infect others. This property has allowed hiv to claim more than 30
million lives so far, and approximately 34 million people are now living
with this virus and facing a highly uncertain future.15 [[A
virus]{.mark} genetically [engineered to infect]{.mark} its host
[quickly,]{.mark} to [generate symptoms
slowly]{.mark}]{.underline}---say, only after weeks or months---and to
spread easily through the air or by casual contact would be vastly more
devastating than hiv. It could silently penetrate the population to
unleash its deadly effects suddenly. This type of epidemic [[would be
almost impossible to combat]{.mark} because most of the infections would
occur before the epidemic became obvious]{.underline}. A technologically
sophisticated terrorist group could develop such a virus and kill a
large part of humanity with it. Indeed, terrorists may not have to
develop it themselves: some scientist may do so first and publish the
details. Given the rate at which biologists are making discoveries about
viruses and the immune system, at some point [in the near future,
someone may create artificial [pathogens]{.mark} that [could **drive the
human race to extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, a detailed
species-elimination plan of this nature was openly proposed in a
scientific journal. The ostensible purpose of that particular research
was to suggest a way to extirpate the malaria mosquito, but similar
techniques could be directed toward humans.16 When I've talked to
molecular biologists about this method, they are quick to point out that
it is slow and easily detectable and could be fought with biotech
remedies. If you challenge them to come up with improvements to the
suggested attack plan, however, they have plenty of ideas. [Modern
[biotech]{.mark}nology [will soon be capable]{.mark}]{.underline}, if it
is not already, [[of bringing about the demise of the human race--- or
at least]{.mark} of killing a sufficient number of people to
[end]{.mark} high-tech [civilization]{.mark} and set humanity back 1,000
years]{.underline} or more. That terrorist groups could achieve this
level of technological sophistication may seem far-fetched, but keep in
mind that it takes only a handful of individuals to accomplish these
tasks. Never has lethal power of this potency been accessible to so few,
so easily. Even more dramatically than nuclear proliferation, modern
biological science has frighteningly undermined the correlation between
the lethality of a weapon and its cost, a fundamentally stabilizing
mechanism throughout history. [[Access to extremely lethal
agents]{.underline}]{.mark}---lethal enough to exterminate Homo
sapiens---[[will be available]{.mark} to anybody with a solid background
in biology terrorists included]{.underline}.

#### Global power projection prevents nuclear war 

Thomas H. **Henricksen 17**, emeritus senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, 3/23/17, "Post-American World Order,"
<http://www.hoover.org/research/post-american-world-order>

The [[tensions stoked by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[assertive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square [[could
**spark a**]{.mark} **political or [military incident]{.mark}** [that
might set off a chain reaction leading to a]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[large-scale wa]{.mark}r]{.underline}**. Historically, powerful
rivalries nearly always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown
war. [The anomalous Cold War era]{.underline} **[spared]{.underline}**
the United States and Soviet Russia a direct conflict, largely from
concerns that one would trigger a **[nuclear exchange
destroying]{.underline}** both states and much of [**the world**. Such a
repetition **might** reoccur in the unfolding]{.underline}
three-cornered [geopolitical world]{.underline}. It seems safe to
acknowledge that an ascendant China and a resurgent Russia will persist
in their geo-strategic ambitions. What Is To Be Done? The first marching
order is to dodge any kind of perpetual war of the sort that George
Orwell outlined in "1984," which engulfed the three super states of
Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania, and made possible the totalitarian Big
Brother regime. A long-running Cold War-type confrontation would almost
certainly take another form than the one that ran from 1945 until the
downfall of the Soviet Union. What prescriptions can be offered in the
face of the escalating competition among the three global powers? First,
[[by **staying militarily**]{.mark} **and economically
[strong]{.mark}**[, the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will]{.mark} have the resources to
[deter its peers']{.mark} hawkish behavior that might otherwise
trigger]{.underline} a **[major conflict]{.underline}**. Judging by the
history of the Cold War, [[the coming strategic chess match with Russia
and China will prove tense and
demand]{.mark}ing]{.underline}---[since]{.underline} **[all the
countries boast nuclear arms]{.underline}** and long-range ballistic
missiles. Next, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should
widen and sustain willing coalitions of partners]{.underline}, something
at which America excels, and at which China and Russia fail
conspicuously. [[There can be **little room for error**]{.mark}
in]{.underline} fraught **[crises among
nuclear-weaponized]{.underline}** and **[hostile powers]{.underline}**.
Short- and long-term standoffs are likely, as they were during the Cold
War. Thus, [the playbook]{.underline}, in part, [involves a **waiting
game** in which each power looks to its rivals to suffer]{.underline}
grievous [internal problems]{.underline} which could entail a collapse,
as happened to the Soviet Union.

#### Unrestrained SOF solves all impacts, restricting it wrecks effectiveness

Joseph **Norman &** Yaneer **Bar-Yam 18**. New England Complex Systems
Institute. 2018. "Special Operations Forces: A Global Immune System?"
Unifying Themes in Complex Systems IX, edited by Alfredo J. Morales et
al., Springer International Publishing, pp. 486--498.

5 Multiscale Military Theory and the Functional Role of SOF [Much like
an organism, our [global civilization is composed of]{.mark} a set of
[distinct social tissues]{.mark}, each with unique character, mode of
internal operation, and interfaces with other tissues. [Healthy]{.mark},
well-functioning social [tissues have internal behaviors that
**sustain**]{.mark} **the individuals composing [them]{.mark}**[, such
as **ag**]{.mark}**riculture**, **goods
[production]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[trading]{.underline}** and
[**[markets]{.underline}**, **[health]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[services]{.underline}**, **[social]{.underline}**
[gatherings]{.underline} and celebrations, [as well as fruitful external
interactions with other social systems such as the [buying and
selling]{.mark} of **commodities, products, and services**.
[When]{.mark} healthy and functional [social tissue is disrupted,
opportunities are created for **malignant forces**]{.mark} to gain
footholds and grow. This dynamic can be seen,]{.underline} for instance,
[in the unintended consequences of the invasion of **Iraq**, which
created the opportunity for terrorist networks and other harmful actors
to increase their power and influence as normal life was disrupted and
power vacuums were created]{.underline}. Moreover, the harm and risks
generated by the growth of malignant forces are not confined to the
local area where they first manifest. [Because of our global
interconnectedness and interdependence, [effects cascade causing
**disruption in other tissues**]{.mark}, [leading to a **domino effect**
with]{.mark} no straightforward mechanism to halt the **[expanding
impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[11,12\]. [The recent and ongoing
**migrant crisis in Europe and beyond** provides an example of one form
such cascading effects can take. Global [interdependency means
any]{.mark}]{.underline} **[large-scale]{.underline}** military
[[intervention]{.mark}, by virtue of disrupting the normal functioning
of society, [will generate]{.mark} both local and **[non-local
unintended consequences]{.mark}** even when desired effects are
achieved]{.underline}. This is not to suggest that large-scale action is
never necessary, but the potential for generating new crises must be
weighed carefully whenever it is considered as an option. In many cases,
action that does not disrupt local, healthy social behavior is possible,
but it requires the right action and agent. The parallels of the effects
of tissue disruption in organisms and in sociocultural systems
highlights the need for a 'sociocultural immune system'---a finegrained
system for sensing and acting on environmental disturbances at scales
smaller than conventional forces are able. [In this regard, conventional
forces can be likened to the large-scale neuromuscular system in
organisms]{.underline}. Acting instead at a small-scale presents the
possibility of maintaining healthy social tissue and allowing it to
flourish. [Just as for the immune system, this is not a matter of
differentiating 'native' and 'foreign', but understanding whether an
agent is disruptive to overall health. [SOF are **uniquely
positioned**]{.mark} to fulfill this role, possessing the requisite
**personnel**]{.underline}, **[skills]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
[**training**. For this to be realized, policies that impact SOF must be
such that they enable their **unique capabilities** in meeting the high
complexity demand of **local cultural systems**]{.underline}. We
identify three conditions that must be satisfied in order for SOF to
serve such a role: special operators with advanced training and
distinctive capabilities, persistent presence and enduring engagements,
and local autonomy and decision-making. We discuss each in turn. 5.1
Distinctive Capabilities [Much like the cells in the immune system have
special forms and functions to fulfill their roles, the distinctive
capabilities of special operators enable them to operate in **highly
complex sociocultural environments**. Advanced **language and cultural
training** allows **unmediated interaction with local peoples**. Special
operators' experience in making decisions in the face of uncertainty
allow them to operate in ill-defined 'gray zone'
conditions.]{.underline} The need to produce special operators with
distinctive capabilities highlights the role of SOF's
high-selectiveness, and emphasizes the necessity of advanced training in
language and culture in addition to combat. These values are articulated
in the SOF truths "Humans are more important than hardware" and "SOF
cannot be mass produced" \[13\]. Preparing special operators to interact
directly and make difficult decisions in complex psychosocial,
sociocultural, and kinetic environments must be a priority of SOF and
their enabling agencies. 5.2 Persistent Presence [The immune system is
embedded throughout the tissues of the body to develop and maintain
sensitivity to the character of local tissue and respond rapidly to
disruptors]{.underline} \[14\]. Similarly, [**persistent presence** of
SOF allows for **nuanced relationships to unfold over time**, and for
**cultural attunement**]{.underline} [to be developed at both the
individual and institutional levels. SOF embeddedness engenders an
understanding of normal conditions and a sensitivity to
changes]{.underline} in those conditions and whether they pose a threat.
[Moreover, presence is necessary for applying **rapid and effective
action** to achieve desired effects with minimal
disruption]{.underline}. Just as SOF must recognize 'self' in multiple
contexts, local cultures must not react to SOF as a foreign entity, i.e.
mutual trust must be present, developed through shared history. Policies
should enhance continuity of interaction between SOF and a given
sociocultural system even, or especially, when there is no immediate or
visible threat. The only way to prevent the growth of malignancies is to
be present and active before they grow. This is reflected in the SOF
truth "competent SOF cannot be created after emergencies occur" \[13\]
and Admiral William McRaven's oft-cited comment that one "can't surge
trust" \[15\]. 5.3 Local Autonomy and Decision-Making [As the cells of
the immune system sense, decide, and act locally in a decentralized
manner, being fine-tuned to the character of their local tissues, so too
must [**SOF** have the ability to **sense, decide, and act
locally**]{.mark} using their nuanced understanding and experience. The
[semi-**autonomy** of SOF is **necessary**]{.mark}]{.underline} for
requisite variety to be achieved in interfacing with high-complexity,
fine-grained environments and disruptors. In human systems, these
disruptors manifest at the psychosocial and sociocultural scales. [It is
possible to take effective action at these scales to eliminate harmful
agents without disrupting healthy social tissue
functioning.]{.underline} This becomes impossible as the scale of a
malignancy grows larger: social tissue will inevitably be damaged by
both the malignancy itself and any large-scale force applied in
response. [[When the **decision-making agent** is]{.mark} both
**[far]{.mark} removed [from]{.mark}** and **insensitive** to the [local
context]{.mark}, as well as receiving multiple information streams about
which decisions must be made, [the **sensitivity**, **nuance**, and
**understanding**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **local** [SOF is
lost]{.mark}.]{.underline} Consequently, the ability to stem malignant
forces while they remain small in scale is diminished, and the
likelihood of disrupting a social system either accidentally or out of
necessity as the scale of harmful actors grows larger increases. [To
enable SOF to act without disrupting social tissue, the
**[institutions]{.mark} overseeing SOF [must not over-constrain their
behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As policy- and decisionmakers look
increasingly to SOF to overcome complex challenges, it is critical that
they do not become overly-bureaucratized. Imperatives that are
communicated to SOF must be guided by their role as a protector of local
tissue function. Protections from the potential for harm to local
tissues, i.e. by civilian collateral damage from operations, must be
instituted in a way that retains local autonomy. Detailed instructions
on how to carry out missions will prevent them from behaving as
necessary for success in highcomplexity environments. In technical
terms, placing too many constraints on their behavior will reduce their
variety below the (requisite) threshold for sensing and acting on
fine-grained disruptors. The consequences of this are twofold: (1) SOF
will lack the ability to sense and eliminate threats while they remain
small, and (2) disruption and destruction of healthy social tissue
becomes inevitable as malignant forces grow and large-scale intervention
becomes the only means of engagement. 6 Challenges and Implementation
While SOF are uniquely positioned to fulfill an immune-system-like
function, there remain significant challenges to successful
implementation. Here we summarize some of these challenges. [Developing
SOF who are]{.underline} both culturally and [**linguistically
competent**, as well as able to execute reconnaissance and surveillance
and direct action missions demands significant investment in training
and preparation]{.underline}. Moreover, for any individual operator
there is a tradeoff in developing proficiency in any given domain.
However, SOF must be able to perform the entire range of activities,
from sensing nuanced changes in social conditions to taking actions to
eliminate harmful disruptors, to preserving social tissue health.
Fundamental limitations on individual capabilities lead to a need for
diversification of roles of SOF. This is manifest already in different
types of SOF, as it is in the immune system which uses cells of various
types, each of which serves particular roles that complement one
another. The relative levels of activity for the different cell-types
vary depending on circumstance; some cells primarily sense tissue
conditions and detect disruptors, while others act to confine and
eliminate harmful agents once they are identified. During an infection
rapid clonal reproduction (replication) of effective types occurs.
Similarly, SOF may embrace and develop specialization of expertise, and
should be flexible enough to adapt force size and composition in
response to changing circumstances. Maintaining the mental health of
special operators must be a priority, and appropriate support systems
should be put in place for this. The high complexity of tasks translates
into the psychological symptoms of stress, depression and burnout,
common in a high complexity society more generally but surely for SOF.
Moreover, adapting to diverse local contexts creates challenges when
switching to home and family environments, a potential component of post
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is a challenge for both the SOF
and their families. Giving special operators a significant degree of
autonomy presents challenges and risks that are distinct from those of
conventional command-and-control systems. Care must be taken to ensure
social tissue is not damaged by unintentional friendly fire, collateral
damage or intentional 'rogue operators'. The potential for disfunction
is not unlike auto-immune disorders in complex organisms and the immune
system has developed mechanisms for prevention, though no mechanism is
failure proof. Local feedback systems including multiple specialized
roles rather than centralized control ones must be in place that put
checks on the actions of operators.The structure of these feedback
mechanisms must be the subject of intensive study. Rapid growth in
recent years has led to institutionalization of SOF using concepts that
may be incorrectly adopted from command control military traditions.
Bureaucratization runs counter to the ability of SOF for performing the
functions we have identified. Rather then enabling SOF function as it
grows, institutionalization may result in undermining the effectiveness
of SOF as it becomes more like conventional forces. Alternative
structures must be developed. They may be inferred from fundamental
complex systems analyses, including correspondence with immune system
functions or well designed experimentation. Institutional structures and
relationships between SOCOM and other enabling agencies, including those
within DoD, and other departments of the executive branch such as the
State Department, need to be carefully considered. For example, how the
agenda of an ambassador of a given region and local SOF should
interrelate is an open question. If command and control structures do
not appropriately interface with SOF, their unique capabilities will not
be utilized effectively. This includes knowing when and, crucially, when
not to utilize SOF to achieve a desired effect. This article is intended
to contribute to this clarification. 7 SOF in the 21st Century [There is
no doubt that as a global civilization we will continue to face
fine-grained, **[high-complexity disruptors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that
have the potential to **[grow into larger-scale malignancies]{.mark}**.
The only way to combat this is to promote and enable the flourishing of
healthy **social tissues**]{.underline}. [Multiscale control systems
theory makes clear the need for an immune-like system embedded within
human social systems. It must be sensitive to and embedded within
**high-complexity psychosocial and sociocultural environments** to make
decisions locally based on understanding of a given social system, its
nuances, and distinctive qualities. Like the various tissues arranged
into functional organs throughout the body, cultures and social systems
do not all look, behave, or function alike. Part of a global strategy
for the 21st century must be the recognition that cultures **can not
simply be 'exported' or 'projected' onto others without pushback**, and
that behavioral diversity at the collective scale is a natural and
healthy part of our human civilization]{.underline}. SOF possess the
unique organizational capabilities to be sensitive to the healthy
behavior of these diverse 'social tissues', while providing the direct
and indirect action capabilities to neutralize malignant forces when
identified. [Moving forward, a major part of the SOF repertoire must
include relationship building. **Interpersonal relationships with local
individuals**]{.underline} [form the **basis** of understanding
necessary to **discern between harmful and beneficial (or neutral)
forces to social health**. The ability to perceive and understand local
tensions, grievances, typical and atypical interactions, customs, and
other nuanced features can serve to generate solutions before the normal
functioning of healthy social tissue is threatened. The highly-complex
and fine-grained nature of this endeavor makes it an unsuitable role for
**conventional** forces -- they can not sense nor act on such a fine
scale. A focus on direct action is important when specific disruptors
have been identified, and not otherwise. [SOF is uniquely positioned to
serve as a **global immune system**]{.mark}, **keeping the diverse set
of social tissues healthy**, and reserving large-scale intervention for
when it is necessary.]{.underline}

#### Court interventions destroy flex- creates burdensome interventions without the relevant interventions that destroys the speed necessary to respond to emerging threats- that's Bloomquist

#### The CP sets a precedent for judicial micromanagement -- it hinders executive flexibility and undermines the war on terror

**Bork and Rivkin, 5** - Robert H. Bork, a senior fellow at the Hudson
Institute, was solicitor general of the United States from 1973 to 1977
and later a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia. David B. Rivkin Jr. is a Washington lawyer who served in the
Justice Department in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations
("A War the Courts Shouldn\'t Manage" Washington Post, 1/21,
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25275-2005Jan20.html>)

As speculation mounts about President Bush\'s nominees to the federal
judiciary, and particularly to the Supreme Court, one factor that should
be of paramount importance is too often overlooked. Curbing or reversing
the Supreme Court\'s usurpation of so many domestic issues is crucial.
But perhaps even [more important is avoiding judicial micromanagement of
America\'s war against]{.underline} radical Islamic [terrorists. Already
there are disturbing signs of [judicial overreaching]{.mark} that
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} constitutionally illegitimate and, in practical
terms, [[potentially debilitating]{.underline}]{.mark}. The vast
majority of war opponents and attorneys for captured terrorists are
pressing for a full-fledged criminal law model never before applied to
enemy combatants. Realizing that Congress and the president will not
adopt their position, these litigants are resorting to the federal
courts. Real abuses that inevitably occur in war, as well as in
peacetime prisons, are being punished by our military, but that does not
assuage critics who have an agenda other than justice. They allege that
the abuses stem from the administration\'s legal analysis and that the
analysis is contrary to the Constitution and to international norms.
That is wrong on both counts. A pair of confusing Supreme Court
decisions handed down June 28 plowed the ground for astounding
lower-court activism. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, involving a petition for habeas
corpus on behalf of a U.S. citizen held by the military as an enemy
combatant fighting in Afghanistan, was a qualified victory for the
government. The court approved the use of military tribunals but held
that Yaser Esam Hamdi must have an opportunity to contest his status as
an enemy combatant. It left unclear how that opportunity could be
exercised, and it is difficult to see how it could be without calling
witnesses from the combat zone, a procedure that would divert American
soldiers from waging war. Rasul v. Bush, on the other hand, was a
disaster for the war effort. Aliens held at Guantanamo Bay, not a part
of the United States or within the jurisdiction of any federal court,
were held to have a right to a habeas petition. The result would seem to
be that captured alien combatants held by the U.S. military anywhere in
the world can henceforth litigate their status in federal courts. [Some
[lower federal courts]{.mark} have [not resisted the temptation to
insert themselves further into the conduct of the war]{.mark}. In doing
so, they have interfered with the war effort]{.underline} while
fostering the false impression that the executive branch is trampling on
constitutional liberties. The district court\'s decision in Hamdan v.
Rumsfeld (2004) is a prime example. The judge applied the Geneva
Conventions in contradiction of the legal framework laid down in Hamdi,
misread the conventions and severely encroached upon the president\'s
war powers. In Omar Abu Ali v. Ashcroft (2004), another district court
outdid the Supreme Court by finding that it had, at least potentially,
authority to determine the legality of a foreign government\'s detention
of an accused dual-nationality terrorist because of an allegation that
the United States had prompted the detention. Nearly 70 years ago, the
court held in a famous decision (Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. v. United
States) that the executive branch\'s extensive prerogatives in foreign
affairs are grounded in its unique expertise, information and unitary
nature. [[Courts have neither the constitutional authority nor the
expertise an]{.mark}d information [to override the president\'s
determinations o]{.mark}n issues [such as whether we are in armed
conflict or what]{.mark} kind of [anti-terrorist cooperation we should
engage in wit]{.mark}h foreign governments]{.underline}. For obvious
reasons, [[the executive cannot share all the relevant information with
judges]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nor has the judiciary the necessary unitary
nature, unless every case is decided by the Supreme Court. Thus, in
addition to fighting legal battles in court, the administration would be
well-advised to make a far stronger public case for its detention
policies, which are designed not only to prevent enemy combatants from
returning to fight against us but also to obtain intelligence that might
save the lives of American soldiers and civilians as well as shorten the
war. Although current detention and interrogation procedures can surely
be improved, and additional safeguards against abuses should be adopted,
these ought to be matters for the political branches. Freezing policies
through constitutional rulings should be a last resort. The executive
and Congress, as circumstances change and experience accumulates, can
debate and resolve in a flexible manner the policy imperatives of
individual liberty and America\'s reputation overseas, on one hand, vs.
the demands of collective safety. But in doing so they must avoid
trampling on the president\'s constitutional prerogatives. Congress
should not lay down detailed prescriptions on what interrogation
techniques are appropriate. And it should resist the temptation to
grandstand; passing exhortations against torture is not the way to
proceed. Sensitivity to these matters and the crucial but limited role
of the judiciary should be taken into account in the choice of nominees
to the courts and in the confirmation process. [Too much is riding on
the outcome of this war]{.underline} \-- ultimately, perhaps, [the
survival of Western societies \-- to choose judges who are unaware of
the complexities of what is at stake]{.underline}.

L. REV. 941, lexis)

[[The costs associated with judicial error are most evident in]{.mark}
cases [involving]{.mark} controversies over the allocation of **[war
powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} First, [[the nature of such
controversies often requires immediate attention]{.mark}, and it may
prove costly for the political branches to await the outcome of a
judicial determination]{.underline}. Second, to the extent that a
determination will turn on whether the executive branch has produced
sufficient evidence to warrant the commencement of military hostilities
without congressional authorization, [the consequences of judicial error
can be]{.underline} extremely high, if not
**[catastrophic]{.underline}**. Imagine, for instance, that the Supreme
Court sets forth a standard for war powers controversies that requires
the President to demonstrate that a foreign country imposes an imminent
threat to national security before he can commence military hostilities
without congressional authorization[. [If]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the
Court errs in its assessment]{.mark} of the severity of an external
threat[, its judgment could leave the country]{.mark}
**[defenseless]{.mark} in the event of an attack.**]{.underline} Such
difficulties underscore an important difference \[\*993\] between
domestic controversies and foreign controversies. In a domestic
controversy, the costs of judicial error are rarely so immediate and
guaranteed to impact a wide number of the U.S. citizenry. It is also
true that in the domestic context, the courts often have ample
opportunity, over time, to correct any prior interpretive errors. This
risk of judicial error is implicit in the decisions that treated the
legality of the Vietnam War as a political question. For example, with
respect as to whether the President\'s decision to mine the harbors of
North Vietnam constituted an unauthorized escalation of war under the
War Powers Act, the Second Circuit articulated the risk of that court\'s
involvement in these terms: Judges, deficient in military knowledge,
lacking vital information upon which to assess the nature of battlefield
decisions, and sitting thousands of miles from the field of action,
cannot reasonably or appropriately determine whether a specific military
operation constitutes an \"escalation\" of the war or is merely a new
tactical approach within a continuing strategic plan \... Are the courts
required to oversee the conduct of the war on a daily basis, away from
the scene of action? In this instance, it was the President\'s view that
the mining of North Vietnam\'s harbors was necessary to preserve the
lives of American soldiers in South Vietnam and to bring the war to a
close. History will tell whether or not that assessment was correct, but
without the benefit of such extended hindsight we are powerless to know.
n225 Using this framework, the court concluded that political branches
were better equipped to handle the foreign affairs and war strategy
questions before it. One might object and argue that the circumstances
described above would only apply when war or imminent threats to
national security issues are at stake. While national security concerns
best illustrate the dangers of judicial intervention, framing this
factor exclusively in terms of war is not appropriate. First, as
explained in Section A above, it is often difficult to separate national
security issues from other soft diplomacy concerns. n226 Second, and
more importantly, [[the costs of judicial intervention stem n]{.mark}ot
so much [from the fact that]{.mark} war may be a factor, but that [the
courts are incapable of predicting]{.mark} whether foreign nations may
be affected by a judicial decision, or [how **such nations may react to
such a decision**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This latter consideration
extends to issues affecting international trade and commerce, as well as
international security. As explained by Justice Brennan in Container
\[\*994\] Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Board, n227 a case involving
a tax dispute, \"this Court has little competence in determining
precisely when foreign nations will be offended by particular acts.\"
n228 In the absence of a more precise understanding of the foreign
interests that may be adversely affected by a judicial determination,
the courts have appropriately left the resolution of such foreign
affairs disputes to the political branches. An objection to this
explanation might be that concerns regarding the effects of litigation
on unrelated parties often arise in the domestic context, but that
courts do not necessarily defer to the political branches in such cases.
For instance, some commentators have described the judicial role in the
prison reform litigation that started in the late 1960s as involving
complex and multifaceted consequences that extended beyond the
traditional adjudicatory model. n229 The late Abram Chayes aptly
characterized these proceedings as one \"which had widespread effects on
persons not before the court and required the judge\'s continuous
involvement in administration and implementation.\" n230 These domestic
affairs controversies are significantly different from those affecting
foreign affairs, however, because the non-party entities affected by
judicial decisions in the domestic context operate largely within the
same legal framework as the courts. On the other hand, in the foreign
affairs context, the affected entities lie outside the jurisdiction of
the domestic courts. Unlike in the domestic context, considerations of
power often weigh as heavily as legal factors in determining the norms
of inter-state behavior. n231 Therefore, there is greater risk that a
court\'s determination in a foreign affairs dispute could have an impact
on a wider range of actors outside the court\'s jurisdiction than it
would in a domestic dispute. The significance of the complex
interactions of political, security, and economic power at work in the
realm of international relations also underscores another reason why the
involvement of courts in foreign affairs might be detrimental to foreign
policy. This rationale involves the inherent \[\*995\] limitations of
the various remedial tools available to the courts when they confront
foreign affairs controversies. For instance, in many international
disputes or controversies, an approach that focuses on power-based
diplomacy and negotiation may be more advantageous to the states
involved than rule-based adjudications. n232 Even one of the leading
proponents of a rule-based approach in international affairs admits that
\"in practice the observable international institutions and legal
systems involve some mixture of both \[rule-based and power-based
diplomatic approaches\].\" n233 Given the continuous relevance of power
as a factor in international relations, the remedial devices available
to the courts - such as injunctions, writs, and declaratory relief - are
inadequate and often inapplicable to foreign affairs controversies. This
is because [[judicial remedies are often designed to addre]{.mark}ss the
concerns of [conventional adjudication]{.mark}]{.underline}, which as
Professor Fuller has explained, almost always involve \"claims of right
or accusation of faults.\" [n234 [In the international
system]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [iss[ues]{.mark} [cannot be neatly
broken down into legally cognizable]{.mark} wrong or right
[answers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such circumstances, [the affected
actors may prefer a more flexible and open-ended resolution of a problem
than would be achieved through a decision based on rules and
standards]{.underline}. Understandably, courts have occasionally invoked
this non-rule based aspect of international diplomacy to justify
abstaining from foreign affairs controversies. n235

Nonetheless, foreign relations remain special, and [[courts must treat
them differently in one important respect]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the
twenty-first century, [[speed matters]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the
[[executive branch alone possesses]{.mark} [the ability to articulate
and implement foreign policy]{.mark} quickly]{.underline}. Even
non-realists will acknowledge that the international realm is much more
susceptible to crisis and emergency than the domestic realm. But speed
remains more important even to non-crisis foreign affairs cases. ^n391^
[It is true that **the stable nature of American hegemony will prevent
truly destabilizing events**]{.underline} from happening without great
changes in the geopolitical situation - the sort that occur over
decades. The United States will not, for some time, face the same sorts
of existential threats as in the past. ^n392^ Nonetheless, [in foreign
affairs matters]{.underline}, [it is [only the executive branch that has
the capacity successfully to conduct]{.mark} \[\*150\] treaty
negotiations,]{.underline} for example, [which depend on adjusting
positions quickly]{.underline}. [The need for speed is particularly
acute in crises]{.underline}. [Threats from]{.underline} transnational
[terrorist groups and]{.underline} loose **[[nuclear weapons are among
the most serious problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** facing the United
States today. The United States maintains a \"quasi-monopoly on the
international use of force,\" ^n393^ but [the [rapid pace of change and
improvements in weapons technology mean that the executive branch must
respond to emergencies long before the courts have an opportunity to
weigh in]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even if a court was able to respond
quickly enough, it is not clear that we would want courts to adjudicate
foreign affairs crises without the deliberation and opportunities for
review that are essential aspects of their institutional competence.
Therefore, [[courts should grant a higher level of deference]{.mark} [to
executive branch determinations]{.mark} in deciding whether to grant a
temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction in foreign
affairs matters]{.underline}. Under the super-strong Curtiss-Wright
deference scheme, the court should accept the executive branch
interpretation unless Congress has specifically addressed the matter and
the issue does not fall within the President\'s textually-specified
Article I powers.

DEFERENCE TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH" lexis)

As Chevron recognized, n73 [the [executive]{.mark} branch
[possesses]{.mark} two institutional [characteristics that make it
superior to courts]{.mark}]{.underline} in the interpretations of
certain kinds of laws. First, [executive [agencies]{.mark} usually
[possess expertise]{.mark} in the administration of certain
statutes,]{.underline} particularly those in complex areas. Second,
[[the]{.mark} executive [branch is subject to greater political
accountability than the judiciary]{.mark}, and the electorate could
ultimately change unwanted interpretations]{.underline}. n74 As Justice
Stevens himself explained in Chevron, \"Judges are not experts in the
field, and are not part of either political branch of the Government.\"
n75 While agencies are not directly accountable to the people, the Chief
Executive is, and it is entirely appropriate for this political branch
of the Government to make such policy choices - resolving the competing
interests which Congress itself either inadvertently did not resolve, or
intentionally left to be resolved by the agency charged with the
administration of the statute in light of everyday realities.

\[\*202\] One way to think about the executive branch\'s comparative
advantage is in terms of the likelihood of errors. [Agencies which
possess greater expertise over a complex and technical statute are less
likely to depart from Congressional intent]{.underline} in their
interpretations of those statutes, especially ambiguous provisions in
those statutes. While agencies may well incur greater costs in making
those decisions, such costs reflect the likelihood that they will seek a
broader set of information about their legal interpretation than that
presented to courts. Indeed, [[unlike courts, the executive]{.mark}
branch [is designed to develop specialized competence. In]{.mark} the
area of [foreign policy, the executive]{.mark} branch [is composed of
large bureaucracies solely focused on designing and implementing foreign
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The more common criticism]{.mark} of the executive branch [is that it
is likely to manipulate]{.mark} its [expertise]{.mark} in the service of
political goals]{.underline}. While [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} may seem
like a criticism, it [[is actually a virtue in the context of resolving
ambiguities in laws implicating foreign affairs]{.mark}. Such laws
nearly always implicate broad policy decisions or political values and
the political nature of the executive branch gives it advantages in
making such decisions]{.underline}. If Congress leaves ambiguities in a
foreign affairs statute, for instance, it is reasonable to assume it
would prefer such ambiguities to be resolved by the more politically
responsive institution. Indeed, it is doubtful that there is substantial
popular support for transferring authority to the judiciary in cases
where the law relates to how to deal with a serious external threat. n76

#### Limited judicial information during a crisis increases the risk of disastrous decisionmaking

the University of Chicago Law School AND \*\*professor at Harvard Law
School (Eric and Adrian, [Terror in the Balance: Security, Liberty, and
the Courts]{.underline} p. 90-91)

As against this view, we suggest that the standard Carolene Products
approach comes unglued during times of emergency. [[Judges]{.mark} face
a risk of committing errors]{.underline} in two directions: they may
erroneously validate policies that stem from democratic failure, or
[they [may erroneously invalidate measures necessary for]{.mark}
national [security]{.mark}]{.underline}. The risks and costs of the
first type of error are constant across both normal times and
emergencies, but in emergencies the risks and costs of the second type
of error spike upward. [[In times of emergency, the judges' information
is especially poor]{.mark}, their ability to sort justified from
unjustified policies especially limited, and the cost of erroneously
blocking necessary security measures may be disastrou]{.underline}s.
[[Included among those costs is the cost of delay, which amounts to a
temporary blockage]{.mark} of new policies and which is especially
serious during emergencies, where time is all.]{.underline} In general,
[the difference in the stakes between emergencies and normal times makes
the limited capacities of judges decisive]{.underline}. Historically,
the judges themselves have recognized this, remaining quiescent until
the emergency decays and passes by. [In times of emergency, [judicial
deference is both desirable and predictable, given the high stakes and
the judges' limited information and competence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### [Even if]{.underline} Congressional oversight is good, using the judiciary is the worst of all worlds- invites judicial scrutiny of foreign affairs broadly and undermines effective responses to terrorism, climate change, disease, and democratic backsliding

Justice Field, of course, does wind up treating the political branch's
conclusions, in this particular setting, as conclusive on the judiciary
--- but he does not rest that outcome on the idea that immigration
control is a sovereign power outside the reach of the Constitution.
Instead, he offers a statement about institutional roles seen as
appropriate for the respective branches of government in this specific
domain. [In the foreign arena]{.underline}, he writes, [as a matter of
"self-preservation,"]{.underline}34 [the government has the]{.underline}
"highest [duty" to "preserve . . . independence, and]{.underline} give
[**security against foreign aggression** and
**encroachment**]{.underline}."35 To achieve these ends, [the government
is **clothed with authority** to determine the occasion on
which]{.underline} the [powers shall be called forth]{.underline}; and
its determinations, so far as the subjects affected are concerned, are
necessarily conclusive upon all its departments and officers. . . . [The
**existence of [war]{.mark}**]{.underline} would [[render the
necessity]{.underline}]{.mark} of the proceeding only [more obvious and
[pressing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The same necessity, in a less pressing
degree, may arise when war does not exist, and the same authority which
adjudges the necessity in one case must also determine it in the other.
In both cases its determination is conclusive upon the judiciary.36 In
other words, [in 1888, the political branches judged
necessary]{.underline} the application of [a new]{.underline} absolute
[rule excluding Chinese laborers]{.underline}, in order [to **achieve
security** against]{.underline} what Congress deemed a type of [foreign
encroachment]{.underline}.37 [Even with misgivings]{.underline} about
the justice or fairness of the action, [[the courts **will not
second-guess**]{.mark} that judgment]{.underline} of necessity.
[[In]{.mark} realms touching]{.underline} upon [**[foreign
relations]{.mark}** and]{.underline} potential **[national
self-preservation]{.underline}**, Field indicates, [[the nation must
**speak with one voice**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [it is not
for]{.underline} the [courts to introduce a discordant
sound]{.underline}. B. Complexity, Prophecy, and Experimentation in
Foreign Affairs Decisionmaking [Some critics]{.underline} of the plenary
power doctrine [question this]{.underline} asserted [**linkage** between
immigration and foreign affairs]{.underline}. Chinese exclusion was not
a foreign affairs decision, they assert, but one driven by domestic
political considerations --- and in fact it worsened our relations with
China.38 The invocation of foreign affairs is seen as a pretext covering
up uglier motives, and the plenary power doctrine prevents courts from
looking behind the mask.39 Therefore, [some assert that courts
should]{.underline} simply [provide]{.underline} the ordinary measure of
**[constitutional scrutiny]{.underline}** --- to smoke out invidious
motives or at least [to provide an appropriate evaluation
of]{.underline} the weight of [the governmental interest]{.underline} in
light of the individual stake.40 This kind of pre-textual invocation
certainly can occur. But [here is the difficulty: We should not
assume]{.underline} that [pretexts in]{.underline} the [foreign
affairs]{.underline} arena [are readily identifiable]{.underline}. As
Justice Breyer observed in a recent political question case:
[[Decisionmaking in]{.underline}]{.mark} \[the [[foreign
affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}\] area typically [[is]{.mark} highly
political]{.underline}. It is ["[**delicate**" and
"**complex**."]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[[rests upon information]{.underline}]{.mark} readily [[available to the
Executive]{.underline}]{.mark} Branch [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
[intelligence committees]{.underline} of [[Congress]{.underline}, [but
**not**]{.underline}]{.mark} readily **[available to [the
courts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It frequently is highly dependent upon
what Justice Jackson called "prophecy." And [the creation of wise
[foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline} typically [[lies]{.mark} well
**[beyond]{.mark}**]{.underline} the experience or professional capacity
of **[[a judge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At the same time, [where foreign
affairs is at issue, the]{.underline} practical [need for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to speak "with one voice and
ac\[t\] as one," is]{.underline} particularly [important]{.underline}.41
Many of [the nation's policy]{.underline} tools [in [the foreign
arena]{.mark} are crude and imprecise, with uncertain impact.
This]{.underline} very [uncertainty may [require
**trial-and-error**]{.mark}]{.underline} application, [[with]{.mark} a
need for **[quick]{.mark}**]{.underline} policy
**[[changes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially **[[in times of
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Therefore, [**[deference]{.mark}** to the
political branches [is called for]{.mark}]{.underline}, not because we
can always be sure that their motives are pure and nondiscriminatory ---
we cannot --- but [because [subjecting these]{.mark}]{.underline}
measures [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} detailed [[litigation would
**interfere with**]{.mark} **the [flexibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}
often [necessary to act beyond our borders]{.underline}. A too-ready
[[judicial interference would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[**impair our
ability** to deploy]{.underline}]{.mark} uncertain [[tools ---]{.mark}
deriving from **immigration**]{.underline} control, [trade regulation,
or]{.underline} other [components of]{.underline} our [international
relations --- [according to a single]{.mark}]{.underline} unified
[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}.42 C. An Example: The Contrast to
Domestic Measures [Consider the **seizure of U.S.
diplomats**]{.underline} by militants [[in Tehran]{.mark} in
1978]{.underline}. After the embassy invasion was ratified and defended
by the new Iranian government, [[the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}
government [[turned to]{.mark} a disparate variety of countermeasures
to]{.underline} try to [win release]{.underline} of the American
hostages, [including the [seizure of]{.mark} billions]{.underline} of
dollars [in [assets]{.mark} of Iran]{.underline} and of its companies
and nationals, litigation in [the International Court of Justice,
a]{.underline}n ill-fated [military rescue attempt]{.underline} after
Iran defied the International Court, [[diplomatic
overtures]{.underline}]{.mark} through Algeria,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} certain [[immigration]{.mark}-law-based
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline} imposed on Iranian nationals in the
United States.43 There were even proposals at the time to use
immigration or other powers to intern large numbers of Iranian nationals
so they could perhaps be part of an exchange that would bring the
diplomats home.44 Thankfully, such internment was never put into motion.
[Contrast]{.underline} the trial-and-error use of [these]{.underline}
generally **[crude and scattershot measures]{.underline}** [with how the
government would respond to a domestic]{.underline} kidnapping and
potential [hostage situation]{.underline}. The police could deploy
quickly to investigate who seized the victims and where they were
currently located. In that process the authorities could use judicial
search warrants to facilitate the inquiry, plus arrest warrants and
compulsory grand jury subpoenas as appropriate. They could call on a
wide range of assistance and technical support from a host of fully
empowered domestic agencies, state and federal. Once the kidnappers were
located, the police would establish perimeter control around the hostage
site. [No hostile militias would stand in the way]{.underline} (or if
such appeared, other governmental power, including the National Guard,
could be deployed). [In a]{.underline} protracted [standoff, judicially
issued search warrants might help legitimate a]{.underline} forcible
[rescue operation]{.underline}. And [the full weight of]{.underline}
criminal [punishment]{.underline}, imposed [through]{.underline}
efficiently functioning [courts, could be expected]{.underline} for the
kidnappers or hostage takers. [This]{.underline} comparison [helps
reveal why courts are positioned to apply close]{.underline}
constitutional **[scrutiny of]{.underline}** official **[domestic
action]{.underline}**, whenever it is credibly challenged,
[but]{.underline} properly [feel]{.underline} more **[constrained [in
the international arena]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the international
arena, U.S. actors generally cannot invoke compulsory process or other
reliable coercive means under their own government's control. Moreover,
[[the **stakes are**]{.underline}]{.mark} typically
[[**higher**,]{.mark} as is the number]{.underline} of people
[potentially affected]{.underline} --- not only by the immediate outcome
but also by downstream effects, as the resolution either deters similar
adverse actions in the future or instead stimulates them because the
U.S. effort failed. [With a domestic operation, judges can be
confident]{.underline} that [the government will]{.underline} still
[have plenty of capacity to deal with]{.underline} public safety
[threats, even in the presence of]{.underline} robust [judicial review.
One cannot have such confidence]{.underline} [about]{.underline} the
efficacy of alternative policy tools in [the **global arena**
if]{.underline} domestic [judicial action begins to]{.underline} prevent
or **[second-guess or slow down]{.underline}** the use of those
initially chosen by [the political branches]{.underline}. Another
difference between the two settings is relevant. In [the domestic arena,
we do not tolerate]{.underline} individuals using **[tit-for-tat
responses]{.underline}** to remedy wrongful behavior. I cannot justify
seizing and carrying away my neighbor's television on the ground that he
borrowed my riding mower months ago and never returned it. But this
prohibition on messy self-help obtains precisely because efficient
hierarchical legal mechanisms, involving professional police and a
developed court system, stand available to redress my neighbor's
wrongful act. In recent decades, the world has taken limited but hopeful
steps toward investing transnational institutions with comparable
powers, but progress remains quite uneven across different policy
domains. [[The plenary power doctrine **manifests**]{.mark}
**the**]{.underline} Supreme [**Court's [judgment]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} the]{.underline} kind of [detailed constitutional
[scrutiny]{.mark} appropriate for the]{.underline} mature and developed
[domestic public order [is **not workable in the**]{.mark}]{.underline}
more primitive [**[international]{.mark} legal [system]{.mark}**,
marked]{.underline} primarily [by]{.underline} horizontal
[action-and-response to]{.underline} try to [rectify
breaches]{.underline}. D. The Nongovernmental Component of Foreign
Affairs Decisionmaking [Foreign affairs are involved in **immigration
decisionmaking** for another]{.underline}, more [entangling
reason]{.underline}, even when there is no clear effort to retaliate
against or to influence a foreign government. Most [high-level
immigration decisions]{.underline} --- by Congress or by the executive
branch --- [are designed]{.underline}, at least in part, [to **influence
or shape behavior overseas**]{.underline} by individuals and nonstate
actors, including both prospective immigrants (contemplating either
legal or illegal channels) and smuggling organizations. For example, the
decision (part of Operation Streamline45) to prosecute a high percentage
of simple entrants without inspection caught along the southern border,
causing them to spend some time in jail or prison before being
repatriated, has been criticized as disproportionate to the inherent
nature of this misdemeanor offense.46 But this critique misunderstands
the policy decision. [Operation Streamline is]{.underline} primarily
[meant to send a **deterrent**]{.underline} message [to others
contemplating a]{.underline} future [clandestine
crossing]{.underline}.47 The same is true of decisions to repatriate
violators to a distant part of the land border rather than back to the
border town from which they entered and where their coyote may be
waiting to help them try again to enter.48 To take another example, [in
1994, the Clinton administration decided to decouple]{.underline} the
grant of [work authorization from]{.underline} the simple act of [filing
for asylum]{.underline}, as had been provided under earlier regulations,
[though this]{.underline} change [would mean that]{.underline} many
[applicants would be without]{.underline} a means of
[support]{.underline}, other than private or family charity,
[for]{.underline} as long as [180 days. This]{.underline} austere step
[was taken]{.underline}, in significant part, [to **discourage people**
planning to come to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
file an ill-founded claim that]{.underline} previously [would have
secured]{.underline} several [years of residence and lawful
work]{.underline} while they awaited a hearing.49 Changes to the
treatment or opportunities of noncitizens in the United States, whether
in the direction of restriction or liberalization, almost inevitably
affect the decisions of people and organizations abroad who are thinking
about organizing or participating in migration to the United States.
Smuggling organizations, in fact, often build their business plans
around finding and exploiting weak spots in immigration laws or
processes.50 As a result, [some]{.underline} U.S. government [measures
take on a more **severe or restrictive aspect** than]{.underline}
[might]{.underline} [initially]{.underline} seem to [be warranted by
the]{.underline} acts of the [individuals most immediately
affected]{.underline}. This is because the policymakers mean the action
not just for those who are the direct object of enforcement on U.S. soil
but also for the message sent to others they want to deter. [This
dynamic appears to explain]{.underline}, in significant part, [the Obama
administration's decisions to respond to the]{.underline} southwest
[border migration surge]{.underline} in summer of 2014 [with
a]{.underline} surprisingly **[severe set of measures]{.underline}**,
including sustained detention, even though the subjects were mainly
children traveling with a mother or other relative. [The
executive]{.underline} branch [also implemented accelerated removal
processing]{.underline} where the law permitted such action, and assured
substantial publicity for the flight whenever recent migrants were
deported by airplane to their home country.51 Despite sharp criticism,
[these practices]{.underline} persisted, and they [seem to have
had]{.underline} much of [the **desired deterrent impact** in
the]{.underline} foreign [nations at issue]{.underline}. In fact,
monthly arrivals of unaccompanied minors from these countries declined
from 10,631 in June 2014 to 2,432 in September.52 [This]{.underline}
kind of [deterrence-based action]{.underline}, focused on overseas
individuals and nongovernmental players, [is]{.underline} also [an
**aspect of foreign affairs**]{.underline}, even though it falls below
the plane of high-level geopolitics. [It]{.underline} likewise [may need
to take the form of]{.underline} rough-hewn [trial-and-error,
like]{.underline} the more [traditional foreign-relations
actions]{.underline} directed at governments. [The]{.underline} Supreme
[Court's case law]{.underline} over the years [appears to consider such
policy]{.underline} choices **[equally worthy of foreign-affairs
deference]{.underline}**.53 [This]{.underline} analysis [is not meant as
advocacy for]{.underline} the quick or expansive use of [immigration
restrictions to respond to objectionable]{.underline} or unwelcome
[actions]{.underline} of foreign governments or nonstate actors. For
reasons of both policy and proportion, immigration sanctions of this
type should be sparingly deployed. [But the Court's **doctrine of
deference**]{.underline} in Chae Chan Ping and later cases [is based on
the recognition that even for]{.underline} relatively [liberal
foreign-affairs decisionmakers, **rough-hewn actions** that]{.underline}
initially [seem outsized]{.underline} or individually unfair [might need
to be in the mix to **respond to**]{.underline}, or to help shape,
**[actions]{.underline}** that others are taking
**[abroad]{.underline}**.54 III. Why the Court Resists Even Moderate
Proposals for a More Active Judicial Role [A]{.underline} more nuanced
[branch of]{.underline} the Chae Chan Ping [criticism accepts that
foreign affairs considerations may]{.underline} well [be at stake
in]{.underline} some [immigration decisions, but would **modify the
doctrine** to allow for a]{.underline} carefully structured **[closer
judicial look]{.underline}**.55 [The courts]{.underline}, such observers
contend, should not take political branch assertions as controlling, but
instead [should perform an initial judicial probe]{.underline} of the
asserted reasons, [to decide whether the]{.underline} challenged
[immigration restriction rests on]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
significant [foreign affairs foundation]{.underline}. If the answer is
yes, then the reviewing court should treat the political branches'
decision as dispositive --- essentially, as a political question not
subject to judicial review. But if not, then the court should apply
ordinary modes of constitutional review, which might well bring a form
of heightened scrutiny. At first glance, this kind of proposal would
seem to offer an attractive middle ground to the Supreme Court. Yet [the
Court]{.underline} in practice [has **manifested great resistance** to
these]{.underline} scholarly [invitations]{.underline}. Why? In my view,
a majority of the [[Justices harbor]{.underline}]{.mark} a [deep
**[skepticism that lower courts can]{.mark} be trusted** to [give
sufficient weight to foreign policy]{.mark} concerns in making any
such]{.underline} threshold [assessment. The]{.underline} very [nature
of immigration litigation]{.underline} in the courts of appeals, with an
actual and often sympathetic human being front and center, [makes
a]{.underline} reviewing [judge]{.underline} far more [likely to
overvalue the]{.underline} individual [interests at stake and undervalue
the]{.underline} more subtle and complex [reasons why a]{.underline}
particular [measure may be **needed for**]{.underline} system
[**stability** or to **influence**]{.underline} behavior [**beyond our
borders** --- connections that]{.underline} often [would not
become]{.underline} fully [apparent until]{.underline} broader damage is
manifested [months or years after an interventionist judicial
decision]{.underline}.56 Anna Law's book, The Immigration Battle in
American Courts, documents this disparity in outlook between the Supreme
Court and the lower courts quite revealingly. She describes "how \[lower
court\] judges can disregard congressional edicts limiting their scope
of review in order to reach a desired result,"57 and can usually get
away with it because the Supreme Court can review only a tiny fraction
of their decisions.58 Professor Law regards this stance by the courts of
appeals as a virtue, but the Supreme Court doubtless views it otherwise.
[[Keeping the]{.mark} plenary power [doctrine **categorical**
gives]{.mark} the]{.underline} Supreme [Court greater [assurance that
lower courts will **preserve**]{.mark} **the space** needed for
government actions to meet]{.underline} real **[[foreign affairs
imperatives]{.underline}]{.mark}** (even if this stance inevitably also
leaves room for some ill-motivated actions adopted by the political
branches). If this symposium were being held at the time of Chae Chan
Ping's centennial, in 1989, we might have had greater reason to expect
some softening by the Supreme Court regarding the deference doctrine in
the foreign affairs arena. Exactly twenty-five years before the week
when this symposium convened in Norman, Oklahoma, the Berlin Wall fell,
signaling that the Soviet bloc was coming apart, about to be replaced,
in many instances, by democratic governments. Lengthy wars were ending
in Latin America, and dictators were being forced from office. [It
appeared we were on the cusp of a]{.underline} far more [**benign world
order** --- one that might permit]{.underline} the rapid flowering of
more [protective international legal institutions and]{.underline}
thereby [reduce reliance on **crude action-and-response**]{.underline}
in the international arena. **[[Today's global scene
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** far more [**[grim]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Not
only has [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[experienced]{.underline} the trauma of [al Qaeda's September 11
attacks]{.underline}, which revealed a genuine need for more vigilant
immigration screening, but [democratic [nations are]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [[facing]{.underline}]{.mark} new [**global threats**
from]{.underline} other [**[nongovernmental actors]{.mark}**
who]{.underline} actually [glorify]{.underline} the use of [beheadings,
crucifixion, and slavery, in addition to]{.underline} other players
using more old-fashioned forms of [**[terrorism]{.mark}** directed at
civilians. **[Failed states]{.mark}** are]{.underline} more
[common]{.underline}, and [well-armed [insurgencies have
**proliferated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The march of [[**democracy** has
slowed]{.mark} and]{.underline}, in several countries, [reversed.
[**Climate change** and]{.mark}]{.underline} even plague-like
[**[diseases]{.mark}** presage]{.underline} more complicated [foreign
policy challenges, many of which [will have a **migration
dimension**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The risks]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [if our government's
foreign-policy]{.underline}-linked [initiatives are
unsuccessful]{.underline}, now [[seem **far
higher**]{.underline}]{.mark} than in 1989. Thus, [I do not foresee
the]{.underline} Supreme [Court retreating significantly
from]{.underline} the strong [deference doctrines]{.underline} derived
from Chae Chan Ping. 59

cannot]{.underline} systematically [improve upon
government's]{.underline} first-order [balancing of security and
liberty. Whatever hope they have of doing so in normal times, as in
ordinary criminal settings where security and liberty trade off against
each other, is dramatically attenuated during times of emergency,
because the judges' information is especially poor and the **costs of
judicial mistakes are especially high.**]{.underline}

#### Courts lack institutional competence to rule on foreign policy questions

DEFERENCE TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH" lexis)

While courts are the primary institutions in the U.S. system for
interpreting and applying laws, some of their key institutional
characteristics undercut their ability in the foreign affairs law
context. In particular, [courts have access to limited information in
foreign affairs cases and are unable to take into account the broader
factual context underlying the application of laws in such
areas]{.underline}.

These limitations are not a failing. They are part of the inherent
design of the federal court system, which is intended to be independent
from politics, to allow parties to drive litigation in particular cases,
and to receive information in highly formal and limited ways. While
these characteristics are helpful for the purposes of neutral
decisionmaking, they also may render courts less effective tools in
resolving ambiguities in laws designed to achieve national goals in
international relations.

[Courts do not actively gather information]{.underline} about a
particular case or a particular law. Rather, that information is
provided to them by the contending parties, in many cases through the
expensive process of discovery. [Any information provided to the court
for evidentiary purposes must survive rules that impose tests for
relevance, credibility, and reliability that are designed to ensure
fairness toward the contending parties.]{.underline} In the criminal
\[\*200\] context, such information is further limited to prevent
violating a defendant\'s constitutional rights.

[By contrast, the executive branch itself collects a wide variety of
information through its own institutional experts and a wide global
network of contacts without the necessity of strict rules of evidentiary
exclusion]{.underline}. While this information may be presented to the
executive branch at any time, a court generally cannot account for new
information except in the context of a new case. n71 [Courts also cannot
update statutory mandates to reflect new information, but instead must
continue to enforce policies even when they are no longer
appropriate.]{.underline} For instance, once the political branches have
enacted a statute or approved a treaty, the courts cannot alter or
refuse to execute those laws, even if the original circumstances that
gave rise to the statute or treaty have changed or even if the national
interest would be harmed. n72

Aside from the judiciary\'s information-gathering limitations, [there
are strong reasons to doubt the ability of the members of the federal
judiciary to resolve effectively foreign affairs laws ambiguities.
Judges are not chosen based on their expertise]{.underline} in a
particular field. Federal judges, with a few minor exceptions, handle a
wide variety of cases without any subject matter specialties. None, for
instance, is chosen because of his or her expertise on matters relating
to foreign affairs or foreign affairs laws.

#### Even if the executive is likely to make poor decisions -- courts are comparatively [more]{.underline} likely to do so

DEFERENCE TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH" lexis)

[None of this analysis, it bears repeating, suggests that the executive
cannot make mistakes]{.underline} or poor judgments in the
interpretations of laws relating to foreign affairs. [The question is
whether it will make more mistakes or poorer judgments and whether it is
less costly to correct its mistakes]{.underline}. [Both institutions can
make mistakes, but our analysis suggests courts are more likely to make
mistakes and that the costs of reversing those mistakes will be
substantial]{.underline}. As the next Part explains, [the failure to
defer]{.underline} to executive interpretations in the Hamdan case
[could significantly]{.underline} \[\*205\] [raise the costs for
adjusting or conforming U.S. national policy toward the war on

### 1ar at: groupthink

#### Groupthink is wrong-

#### 1\-\--Empirics go neg -- the best example of group-think was Iraq -- where Bush requested Congressional authorization, submitted all of the flawed intel to Congress and received [unanimous]{.underline} approval. Proves they don't stop bad decisions- they just impose delays that reduce effectiveness.

#### 2\-\--No impact- small scale interventions don't escalate

#### 3\-\--Executive is fragmented and pluralistic---Congress links harder

**Posner and Vermeule, 7** -- \*Kirkland and Ellis Professor of Law at
the University of Chicago Law School AND \*\*professor at Harvard Law
School (Eric and Adrian, Terror in the Balance: Security, Liberty, and
the Courts p. 46-47)

[[The idea that Congress will]{.underline}]{.mark}, on net, [[weed out
bad policies rests on an institutional comparison]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The president is elected by a national constituency on a winner-take-all
basis (barring the remote chance that the Electoral College will
matter), whereas Congress is a summation of local constituencies and
thus affords more voice to political and racial minorities. At the level
of political psychology, [decisionmaking within the executive is prone
to]{.underline} group polarization and other forms of [groupthink or
irrational panic]{.underline},51 [whereas the internal diversity of
legislative deliberation checks these forces]{.underline}. At the level
of political structure, Congress contains internal veto gates and
chokepoints---consider the committee system and the fi libuster
rule---that provide minorities an opportunity to block harmful policies,
whereas executive decisionmaking is relatively centralized and unitary.

[The contrast is drawn too sharply, because [in practice **the executive
is a they, not an it**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Presidential
oversight is incapable of fully unifying executive branch policies,
which means that **[[disagreement flourishes]{.mark} within the
executive as well, [dampening panic and
groupthink]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and providing minorities with
political redoubts]{.underline}.52 Where a national majority is
internally divided, [the structure of presidential politics creates
chokepoints that can give racial or ideological minorities
disproportionate influence, [just as the legislative process]{.mark}
does]{.underline}. Consider the influence of Arab Americans in Michigan,
often a swing state in presidential elections.

[It is not obvious]{.underline}, then, [that statutory authorization
**makes any difference at all**]{.underline}. One possibility is that a
large national majority dominates both Congress and the presidency and
enacts panicky policies, oppresses minorities, or increases security in
ways that have ratchet effects that are costly to reverse. If this is
the case, a requirement of statutory authorization does not help.
Another possibility is that there are internal institutional checks,
within both the executive branch and Congress, on the adoption of
panicky or oppressive policies and that democratic minorities have real
infl uence in both arenas. If this is the case, then a requirement of
authorization is not necessary and does no good. Authorization only
makes a difference in the unlikely case where the executive is
thoroughly panicky, or oppressively majoritarian, while Congress resists
the stampede toward bad policies and safeguards the interests of
oppressed minorities.

Even if that condition obtains, however, the argument for authorization
goes wrong by failing to consider both sides of the normative ledger. As
for majoritarian oppression, the multiplicity of veto gates within
Congress may allow minorities to block harmful discrimination, but it
also allows minorities to block policies and laws which, although
targeted, are nonetheless good. As for panic and irrationality, [[if
Congress is more deliberative,]{.mark} one result will be to prevent
groupthink and slow down stampedes toward bad policies, but
[a]{.mark}nother [result will be to delay necessary]{.mark} emergency
[measures and **slow down stampedes toward good
policies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Proponents]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the authorization requirement sometimes [[assume
that]{.underline}]{.mark} quick action, even [[panicky action,
**always** produces bad policies. But]{.mark} there is no necessary
connection between these two things; [expedited action is sometimes
good, and panicky crowds can stampede either]{.mark} in the wrong
direction or in the right [direction]{.mark}. Slowing down the adoption
of new policies through congressional [oversight retards]{.mark} the
adoption [not only]{.mark} of [bad policies, but also]{.mark} of [good
policies]{.mark} that need to be adopted quickly if they are to be
effective]{.underline}.

#### 4\-\--No groupthink- studies

Anthony **[Hempell 4]{.underline}** \[User Experience Consulting Senior
Information Architect, "Groupthink: An introduction to Janis\' theory of
concurrence-seeking tendencies in group work.,
http://www.anthonyhempell.com/papers/groupthink/, March 3\]

[In the thirty years since Janis first proposed the groupthink
model,]{.underline} **[there is still little agreement as to the
validity of the model in assessing decision-making
behaviour]{.underline}** (Park, 2000). **[[Janis\'
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}** is often criticized because it **[[does
not present a framework that is suitable for empirical
testing]{.underline}]{.mark}**; instead, the evidence for groupthink
comes from largely qualitative, historical or archival methods
(Sunstein, 2003). Some critics go so far as to say that **[Janis\'s
[work relies on \"anecdote, casual observation, and intuitive appeal
rather than rigorous research]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" (Esser, 1998,
cited in Sunstein, 2003, p.142). [While some studies have shown support
for the groupthink model,]{.underline} the **[support tends to be mixed
or conditional]{.underline}** (Esser, 1998); some studies have revealed
that a closed leadership style and external threats (in particular, time
pressure) promote groupthink and defective decision making (Neck &
Moorhead, 1995, cited by Choi & Kim, 1999); **[the effect of group
cohesiveness is still inconclusive]{.underline}** (Mullen, Anthony,
Salas & Driskel, 1994, cited by Choi & Kim, 1999). [[Janis\'s]{.mark}
model tends to be supported by [studies]{.mark} that [employ a
qualitative case-study]{.mark}]{.underline} [[approach **as opposed to
experimental research**]{.mark}**, which tends to either partially
support or not support Janis\'s thesis**]{.underline} (Park, 2000). The
lack of success in experimental validation of groupthink may be due to
difficulties in operationalizing and conceptualizing it as a testable
variable (Hogg & Hains, 1998; Park, 2000). Some **[researchers have
criticized Janis for categorically denouncing groupthink as a negative
phenomenon]{.underline}** (Longley & Pruitt, 1980, cited in Choi & Kim,
1999). Sniezek (1992) argues that **[[there are instances where
concurrence-seeking may promote group
performance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When used to explain behaviour in a
practical setting, **[groupthink has been frames as a detrimental group
process; the result of this has been that many corporate training
programs have created strategies for avoiding groupthink in the
workplace]{.underline}** (Quinn, Faerman, Thompson & McGrath, 1990,
cited in Choi & Kim, 1999). Another criticism of groupthink is that
Janis overestimates the link between the decision-making process and the
outcome (McCauley, 1989; Tetlock, Peterson, McGuire, Chang & Feld, 1992;
cited in Choi & Kim, 1999). [Tetlock et al argue that there are many
other factors between the decision process and the outcome. [The outcome
of any decision-making process]{.mark}]{.underline}, they argue, [[will
only have a certain probability of success due to]{.mark} various
[environmental factors]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as luck). A
large-scale study researching decision-making in seven major American
corporations concluded that [decision-making worked best when following
a sound information processing method]{.underline}; however these groups
also showed signs of groupthink, in that they had strong leadership
which attempted to persuade others in the group that they were right
(Peterson et al, 1998, cited in Sunstein, 2003). Esser (1998) found that
groupthink characteristics were correlated with failures; however
[cohesiveness did not appear to be a factor:]{.underline} groups
consisting of strangers, friends, or various levels of previous
experience together did not appear to effect decision-making ability.
[Janis\' claims of insulation of groups and groups led by autocratic
leaders did show that these attributes were indicative of groupthink
symptoms. [Moorhead & Montanari conducted a study]{.mark} where [they
concluded]{.mark} that [groupthink]{.mark} symptoms [had no]{.mark}

\"the relationship between groupthink-induced decision defects and

ambiguous or even contradictory (Sunstein, 2003). When reading the

it fair to measure groupthink theory on the basis of laboratory tests,
when in real life groupthink occurs within a complex and volatile
environment? Janis\'s original method was one of inductive reasoning
from archival records and case studies; perhaps it is better left as a
qualitative model that can help illuminate the inexact spheres of
organizational behaviour and communications theory.

\"Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\'s views on executive power may
stir controversy\", USA TODAY,
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/12/supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-fan-presidential-powers/776292002/

WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh argued in 1998 that
President Bill Clinton could be impeached for lying about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky. For much of the next decade he worked inside the
White House for President George W. Bush, where he came to the
conclusion that \"the job of president is far more difficult than any
other civilian position in government.\" Thus it was that in 2009, after
Barack Obama won the presidency, he suggested that presidents should be
immune from criminal investigations and prosecutions, as well as
personal civil suits, until after leaving office. \"I believe it vital
that the president be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as
few distractions as possible,\" he wrote. [[Kavanaugh\'s]{.mark}
evolving [views on executive power]{.mark}]{.underline} through the past
three presidencies **[[are]{.mark} [supported by mainstream
conservatives]{.mark}]{.underline}** today. But they are viewed with
suspicion by some who believe the presidency has grown more powerful
than the framers of the Constitution intended. And Democrats are
concerned that President Donald Trump\'s nomination of Kavanaugh for the
Supreme Court is a reward for his espousal of presidential powers.
Should he win confirmation, some of them say, he should recuse himself
from cases involving Trump. \"The president of the United States should
not be above the law. The president of the United States should not be
beyond a criminal investigation,\" said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. \"The
president of the United States should not be able to pick the judge that
will preside over questions involving his investigation.\" While Senate
Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said the focus of his party\'s
effort to defeat Kavanaugh will be the judge\'s views on abortion and
health care, his position on executive power is quickly emerging as a
third front in the confirmation war. More: Will Brett Kavanaugh deliver
the change conservatives crave? More: Brett Kavanaugh is President
Trump\'s nominee for the Supreme Court More: For Trump, nomination may
hinge on Kavanaugh\'s risks and rewards Like many conservatives,
including most of those on the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh objects to one
form of executive branch power: that exercised by federal regulators
and, in particular, independent agencies. He is wary of green-lighting
most agency rules under a 1984 Supreme Court decision, a process that
has come to be known as \"Chevron deference.\" Just this year, Kavanaugh
dissented from a U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit ruling that upheld the structure of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, an independent agency created by Congress in 2010 in
the wake of the financial crisis on Wall Street. He called such agencies
\"a headless fourth branch of the U.S. Government\" that \"hold enormous
power over the economic and social life of the United States.\"
[Protecting the president]{.underline} For a primary author of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr\'s occasionally explicit report
detailing Clinton\'s transgressions, Kavanaugh traveled a long way to
his 2009 article in the Minnesota Law Review recommending that
presidents be free from prosecution. \"This is not something I
necessarily thought in the 1980s or 1990s,\" he wrote. But \"looking
back to the late 1990s, for example, the nation certainly would have
been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin
Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case
and its criminal-investigation offshoots.\" [Kavanaugh]{.underline} did
not [suggest]{.underline} that judges treat presidents differently,
however. He said Congress should pass a law providing that civil suits
and criminal investigations be deferred while the president is in
office. If the president acts \"dastardly,\" he said, \"the impeachment
process is available.\" The law review article -- which also included
recommendations for making agencies more accountable to the president
and, interestingly, streamlining the judicial confirmation process -- is
certain to be a focus when Kavanaugh goes before the Senate Judiciary
Committee later this summer or fall. Former Attorney General Alberto
Gonzales, who supervised Kavanaugh in the White House counsel\'s office,
said the nominee is \"probably right\" that a sitting president should
be immune from indictment and prosecution while in office. \"If
appointed and this issue were to come before the court, I think it
likely Brett would recuse on this issue,\" Gonzales said. [\'Enormous
concentration of power\' In hundreds of opinions and dissents at the
powerful appeals court, [Kavanaugh]{.mark}]{.underline} **[has
[backed]{.mark} the [president\'s national security powers]{.mark} and
has defended the use of military tribunals]{.underline}** for terrorism
suspects. "[Especially on national-security-related areas, [he is likely
to be]{.mark} with the more [pro-executive power]{.mark} folks on the
current court]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} Jonathan [Adler, an
expert on administrative law at Case Western Reserve University School
of Law. That would not represent much of a change at the high court,
where [conservative justices **usually**]{.mark} **[support]{.mark} the
[president on matters involving national security]{.mark}**.
Just]{.underline} [last month, the court ruled 5-4 -- with retiring
Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority -- that Trump acted legally and
constitutionally in banning travelers from five predominantly Muslim
nations.]{.underline}

### 2ar at: yoo bad

#### The people bashing him are wrong

**WSJ 10**, citing DOJ senior ethicist and Associate Deputy Attorney
David Margolis, "Vindicating John Yoo",
https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704757904575078182303405948

So [[after **five years of investigation**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[**partisan accusations** and **unethical media leaks**]{.underline},
[[the]{.mark} [Justice Department\'s **senior
ethicist**]{.mark}]{.underline} [has [concluded]{.mark} that Bush
Administration lawyers John [Yoo]{.mark} and Jay Bybee [committed **no
professional misconduct**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The issue now is whether
the proteges of Attorney General Eric Holder who led this exercise at
Justice\'s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) should themselves
be in the dock. That\'s our reading of the analysis by Associate Deputy
Attorney General David Margolis, a career official who reviewed both the
Bush-era legal memos on interrogating terror suspects and their review
by the lawyers at OPR. Remarkably, [his report is far more scathing
about OPR than it is about]{.underline} Messrs.
[[Yoo]{.underline}]{.mark} and Bybee, [who he says [made legal
errors]{.mark} but did so [in good faith]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[out of
honest legal analysis,]{.mark} and in the ethical service of their
clients in the executive branch]{.underline} at a time of war. Mr.
Margolis\'s review overrules both a draft OPR report whose contents were
leaked to the media last year and a final OPR report that was released
along with the Margolis review late Friday. Those OPR reports
recommended disciplinary action and potential disbarment for Messrs.
Bybee and Yoo for their advice while working in the Office of Legal
Counsel in the frantic months after September 11. [The [leaks
were]{.mark} themselves an [**unethical attempt** to smear]{.mark} the
[reputations of]{.mark} the [lawyers]{.mark} while they were under a gag
order and unable to reply.]{.underline} House Judiciary Chairman John
Conyers nonetheless leapt to praise Friday\'s release of earlier drafts,
touting them as evidence that the OLC memos were \"legally flawed and
fundamentally unsound.\" Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy promptly
called for Judge Bybee to resign from the federal bench. Both Democrats
have scheduled more grandstanding, er, hearings, for the coming days.
Justice is defending its pre-weekend document dump by saying that it had
to release the entire record. But notably, Justice failed to release a
14-page January 19, 2009 letter from then-Attorney General Michael
Mukasey and Deputy AG Mark Filip that eviscerated the first OPR draft.
The Mukasey-Filip memo has since appeared on media Web sites, and its
withering analysis clearly made an impression on Mr. Margolis. The
selective disclosure by Mr. Holder suggests the political nature of this
entire exercise. \-\-- Readers can review the documents for themselves,
but two OPR judgments deserve particular scorn. The first is the claim
that Messrs. Yoo and Bybee were so close to their client, i.e., the
White House, that they knew what the President and CIA wanted to hear.
But it is perfectly appropriate for a lawyer to know what his client
wants, and, by OPR\'s standard, 99% of professional lawyers could be
considered guilty of misconduct. The ethicists at OPR also claim the
Bush attorneys were wrong to stick to a legal analysis of interrogation
practices and should have also considered their moral and policy
implications. But [[the duty of the O]{.mark}ffice of [L]{.mark}egal
[C]{.mark}ounsel [is]{.mark} precisely [to offer]{.mark} [legal
advice]{.mark}, [not]{.mark} to [render]{.mark} [policy
judgments]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Interrogation policy was determined by
the **CIA and the White House**, as it should have been]{.underline}.
The last thing the country needs is for lawyers to tell the CIA how to
get actionable intelligence from enemy combatants. What\'s more, as Mr.
Mukasey\'s memo makes clear, the legal canons of Washington, D.C. and
many states expressly prohibit lawyers from offering such policy advice
to sophisticated clients such as the U.S. government. This is precisely
so lawyers don\'t muddy their legal counsel with policy bias. The rotten
quality of the OPR efforts \-- and Mr. Margolis\'s repudiation of them
\-- raises real questions about the lawyers who produced this work. H.
Marshall Jarrett, who supervised the first OPR draft, is a protege of
Mr. Holder who managed not to produce his draft report until the Bush
Administration was preparing to leave office. After Mr. Mukasey
\"memorialized\" his concerns, as his letter put it, the Jarrett draft
was leaked without the Mukasey response. Mr. Holder reassigned Mr.
Jarrett in April 2009 to lead the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys,
an arguably more powerful post. His OPR effort makes him unfit for such
a job. Mr. Holder replaced Mr. Jarrett at OPR with Mary Patrice Brown,
who tried to salvage OPR\'s original conclusions with a new but equally
deficient argument. After abandoning OPR\'s earlier specific allegations
that Messrs. Yoo and Bybee had violated D.C. Rule of Professional
Conduct 1.1 to provide competent representation and rule 2.1 to exercise
independent legal judgment, Mr. Margolis writes, Ms. Brown\'s final
report \"did not specify the rule or rules of professional conduct that
were violated.\" Instead, she added consideration of a \"best
practices\" memo and guiding principles. Mr. Margolis writes that these
documents raise several concerns, not least that \"neither of them
existed at the time Yoo and Bybee worked at OLC.\" Ms. Brown is
reportedly in line for a judicial nomination, and Republicans ought to
keep her embarrassing performance in mind when they vote on
confirmation. \-\-- Mr. Margolis deserves credit for his independent
analysis, but we also can\'t help but notice the striking change of tone
in the last few pages of his report. [Mr. Margolis\'s only duty was
determining whether the Bush attorneys had adhered to proper ethical
standards]{.underline}. **[On that question, he is unequivocal in saying
they did.]{.underline}** However, at the end of his 68-page review he
indulges in some superfluous commentary that Messrs. Yoo and Bybee
exhibited \"poor judgment\" and that some of their legal analysis was
mistaken. This is a matter of opinion \-- akin to writing an op-ed piece
\-- unrelated to the question of whether they behaved unethically, and
it is precisely the kind of judgment that Mr. Margolis says earlier in
the report that he will not render. His change of tone is notable enough
that it raises a question of whether Mr. Margolis decided to add this
concluding rhetoric as a way to propitiate Mr. Holder and to save at
least some face for the AG\'s proteges. Republicans should ask Mr.
Margolis about this if Democrats proceed with their hearings. [[The
larger story]{.mark} here [is the **vindication of**]{.mark} **Mr.
[Yoo]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and the other Bush attorneys, [who]{.mark}
[were **pilloried unfairly**]{.mark} **[over
ethics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in what was really a **policy
dispute**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the war on terror]{.underline}.
[[Democrats wanted to appease the anti-antiterror left]{.underline},
[and they fixed on **punishing mid-level
officials**]{.underline}]{.mark} as prominent enough to get public
at:tention but not so prominent as to seem like a banana republic
seeking revenge against a former President or Vice President. **[[Their
campaign has now been exposed as a partisan, and unethical,
smear.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Their indicts amount to naked partisanship

**Eastman, 9** - dean at Chapman University School of Law and a
professor of constitutional law (John, "His views spark important
debate" Los Angeles Times, 4/9,
<http://www.latimes.com/la-oe-eastman9-2009apr09,0,2922332.story>)

[As the dean of the law school]{.underline}, I welcome his presence and
the debate it has provoked. The opportunity to confront positions with
which one disagrees is the hallmark of a first-rate education. As a
constitutional law scholar, [I should]{.underline} also [note my
disagreement with Yoo\'s detractors.]{.underline} In my view, [the legal
positions Yoo advanced in the post-9/11 memos are supported]{.underline}
\-- some well supported; others at least arguable \-- [by constitutional
text, historical understanding and legal precedent]{.underline}. In
fact, [many of those positions were shared by Clinton administration
officials now serving in the Obama administration]{.underline}. For
example, one memo argued that the Geneva Convention does not apply to
unlawful combatants, such as members of Al Qaeda, who target civilian
populations and otherwise violate the rules of war. That position was
shared at the time by Eric H. Holder Jr., now the U.S. attorney general.
In 2002, in a CNN interview, Holder stated: \"It seems to me that given
the way in which they have conducted themselves, however, that they are
not, in fact, people entitled to the protection of the Geneva
Convention. They are not prisoners of war.\" Another controversial legal
position advanced in the memos was that provisions of the Bill of Rights
did not apply beyond the shores of the United States, particularly to
wartime conduct. For authority, the memo cited the case of Harbury vs.
Deutch, in which a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of
Appeals held in 2000 that the 5th Amendment does not apply abroad to
claims of torture by CIA-paid agents against foreign nationals. At issue
were allegations of torture that occurred over an 18-month period \--
half of it during the first year of the Clinton administration and that,
according to the complaint, included this: \"They chained and bound him
naked to a bed, beat and threatened him, and encased him in a fullbody
cast to prevent escape.\" The appeals court accepted the arguments made
by Wilma Lewis, a U.S. attorney during the Clinton administration, that
the 5th Amendment does not apply to claims of torture involving \"an
alien rebel commander leading an attempt violently to overthrow a
foreign government,\" even when the torture was alleged to have been
committed by paid agents of, and at the request or at least full
knowledge of, the CIA. The opinion was written by Judge David S. Tatel,
a Clinton appointee, and joined by Judge Harry T. Edwards, a Carter
appointee, and Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee. Even the
controversy about the 4th Amendment in the most recently released memo
is not as clear-cut as Yoo\'s opponents would have it. The 1972 Supreme
Court decision they rely on in their arguments indeed held that the 4th
Amendment requires a warrant for electronic surveillance of U.S.
citizens in domestic security matters. But the opinion for the court by
Justice Lewis F. Powell expressly left open the question of whether
those requirements would apply to domestic surveillance of agents of
foreign powers. Powell strongly suggested that they would not, favorably
citing a District Court decision that drew such a distinction because
the Supreme Court had long recognized the president\'s \"inherent power
with respect to foreign relations.\" In other words, whether the 4th
Amendment limited the president\'s commander-in-chief power to conduct
surveillance of enemy agents on our soil, in time of war, was a close
enough question that the Supreme Court had not resolved it. Yoo\'s
position was therefore hardly incompetent and indefensible, as some of
his detractors claim. Indeed, it would be incompetent and indefensible
for Yoo to have ignored Powell\'s caveat and concluded that the case
resolved a question the court explicitly left open. [After 9/11, the
lawyers at the Justice Department faced unprecedented legal questions.
They had been given the task of identifying the executive powers that
could legally be brought to bear]{.underline} [to prevent future
attacks. That they were aggressive in their legal interpretations should
come as no surprise]{.underline}, given the circumstances. [In the end,
the president\'s options were more thoroughly vetted by lawyers than at
any wartime era in our nation\'s history]{.underline}. There were no
wholesale detentions based on race, such as occurred under President
Roosevelt in World War II. No systematic suppression of antiwar speech,
such as under President Wilson in World War I. [That there is a great
deal of disagreement about the constitutionality of the lines the
lawyers drew is also no surprise \-- the Constitution deliberately keeps
the lines between congressional and executive wartime
powers,]{.underline} and between those branches and the courts,
deliberately [ambiguous. But disagreement about closely contested issues
hardly supports the exaggerated claims that Yoo]{.underline} and his
colleagues [shredded the Constitution, or that he should not be teaching
law]{.underline}.

**Meese 86** (Edwin III, Distinguished Fellow in Public Policy and Chair
of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies -- Heritage Foundation,
"The Tulane Speech: What I Meant", Washington Post, 11-13, Lexis)

[The burden]{.underline} of The Post\'s editiorial
[concerned]{.underline} what I believe [about the force of Supreme Court
decisions]{.underline}. Does a ruling have general applicability beyond
the case itself? May public officials and private citizens choose to
ignore them at will? Putting the worst construction on what I did not
say, The Post wondered whether the speech might be \"an invitation to
constitutional chaos and an expression of contempt for the federal
judiciary and the rule of law.\" I believe it is important not only to
put these concerns to rest but also to emphasize again the point of the
speech \-- that our Constitution is the supreme or paramount law of the
land. [Supreme [Court decisions]{.mark} do, of course, [have general
applicability. In addition]{.mark} to **[binding]{.mark} the
[parties]{.mark}** in the case [at hand, a decision is binding precedent
on]{.mark} lower [federal]{.mark} courts [as well as state
courts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further, such decisions, as Lincoln once
said, are \"entitled to very high respect and consideration in all
parallel cases\" by the other departments of government, both federal
 \[\*1004\]  and state. Arguments from prudence, the need for stability
in the law, and respect for the judiciary will and should persuade
officials of these other institutions to abide by a decision of the
Court. It would be highly irresponsible for them not to conform their
behavior to precedent. I quite agree with The Post that, for example,
the general principle laid down in Brown v. Board of Education

[[decisions by the Court]{.underline}]{.mark} are not \"the supreme law

**law**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as I said at Tulane, and they are the law
of the land in the sense that they do indeed have general applicability
and deserve the greatest respect from all Americans.
