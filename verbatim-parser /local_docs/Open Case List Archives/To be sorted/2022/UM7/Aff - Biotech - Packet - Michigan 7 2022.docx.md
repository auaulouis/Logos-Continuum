#### Meta-analysis shows scientific certainty of the dual-use threat.

Thuy Uyen Ha Lam & Pei Rou Ng, "Emerging Biosecurity Threats and
Responses: A Review of Published and Gray Literature" in *Emerging
Threats of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology*, pp 13--36\]

Dual Use

was the most frequently mentioned threat, appearing in half of the
analyzed articles[. Dual use research of concern is defined as "life
sciences research that, based on current understanding, can be
reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or
technology that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant
threat with broad potential consequences to public health and safety,
agricultural crops and other plants, animals, the environment, material,
or national security]{.underline}," (Lev and Samimian-Darash 2014).
DiEuliis and Giordano (2018) further state that "any tool that imparts
great capability also involves at least some risk, if not threat, that
the power conferred by such capacity can be used to leverage or evoke a
variety of ends." [This is at the center of the concern over dual use
research. The majority of biotechnology research and modernization is
legitimate and done with the goal of benefiting society]{.underline} --
that is, to beneficial ends. However, [the same knowledge and techniques
gained from beneficial research can be used maliciously]{.underline}.
For instance, [CRISPR-Cas9 is being used to perform targeted gene
editing as a treatment for cancer,]{.underline} increasing our ability
to treat cancer and reducing our reliance on toxic chemotherapy drugs,
[but it could also be used to edit pathogens to increase their
virulence]{.underline}. Indeed, the **[dual use applications and threats
from CRISPR are prominently featured in the literature]{.underline}**
(Vogel and Ouagrham-Gormley 2018; Webber et al. 2015).

Much of the controversial dual use research in biotechnology involves
gain of function (GOF) studies, a term used in 12% of articles. Duprex
et al. (2014) considers GOF to be a "generic label for a broad class of
experiments that lead to a genetically altered biological agent with new
or enhanced functions." Much of the concern over GOF studies includes
research on the avian influenza virus and relatives of the smallpox
virus (Evans et al. 2015; Duprex et al. 2014). [These studies conferred
new traits to the virus that increased its virulence in order to study
transmission or vaccine creation, but also have a clear application for
biological weapon (bioweapon) development]{.underline}. In this way,
[they are both GOF and dual use research. Publishing these sorts of
studies is considered a biosecurity threat of its own because the
information could allow a nefarious actor to create a bioweapon when
they otherwise wouldn't have had the knowledge to do so]{.underline}. We
refer to this threat as "information access" and it is mentioned in 9%
of articles. DiEuliss and Gronvall (20) touch on this threat while
writing about the controversial publication of a study that synthesized
horsepox from scratch. They state that "horsepox is not a significant
disease for humans, but there is concern that publication of these
experiments could lower barriers toward the synthesis and booting up of
another orthopoxvirus, variola (smallpox) virus, which was a significant
scourge in history."

#### Scenario 1 is bioweapons. 

#### Terror groups are trying to get them.

SECURITY THREATS

[Recent advances in synthetic biology]{.underline}, a technology that
can be used to artificially create organisms in labs, **[carry the
foreboding potential to develop biological weapons.]{.underline}**
Moreover, [the emergence of the DIY community and the open-source nature
of this movement have sparked concerns that terrorists could easily
acquire the information needed to weaponize biotechnology]{.underline},
although none of these DIY groups have exhibited any nefarious
intentions. [Nefarious actors who previously acquired pathogens from a
lab or from nature with the intention of developing a bioweapon can now
either order DNA fragments online and assemble them to create dangerous
pathogens]{.underline} or synthesize lethal pathogens from scratch using
genomic information available online. Moreover, such actors can leverage
vulnerabilities in the cyber defenses of labs and private companies to
gain access to sensitive information that is not publicly available
online.

To better understand the security threats emerging from recent
developments in biotechnology, it is worthwhile to return to the
aforementioned hypothetical Ebola scenario. Imagine for a moment that
the researchers involved, in collaboration with an editor at an esteemed
journal, decided that they would publish a redacted version of the
methods and the results section of their research due to security
concerns. A month after the paper was published, the lab noticed unusual
activity on their servers. The lab immediately reported the incident to
the university's information technology department. The department
contacted local law enforcement officials, and together they traced the
hack to a suspected terrorist organization. The group was trying to gain
access to the methodology that led to the accidental creation of a more
virulent Ebola strain so as to launch a deliberate biological attack.
Law enforcement put DNA synthesis companies on high alert for any orders
that closely aligned with research on the Ebola virus or other high-risk
pathogens. Thankfully, a company was able to flag an order and law
enforcement was able to cooperate with local officials to shut down the
unauthorized lab before it began creating and releasing harmful
products.

In reality, [individuals have at times tried to acquire deadly pathogens
and other sensitive biological information]{.underline}. For example,
[two Canadians were arrested in the city of Buffalo]{.underline}, New
York in 1984 [after they were suspected of illegally acquiring and
smuggling strains of botulism]{.underline} and tetanus to Canada. [The
Japanese cult]{.underline} Aum Shinrikyo [made]{.underline} unsuccessful
[attempts]{.underline} in 1995 [to acquire]{.underline} strains of
[Ebola]{.underline} from Central Africa to develop the group's
biological weapons program. More recently, [two Chinese hackers were
indicted in the United States for seeking to obtain intellectual
property related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines.]{.underline}
Similar incidents were reported in Spain; allegedly Chinese hackers were
trying to steal data from Spanish labs conducting vaccine research.

In addition to strategically [embedding members into research
organizations to acquire these deadly pathogens, some terrorist
organizations also have sought to rely on lab insiders to either develop
biological weapons or grant access to organisms or sensitive
information]{.underline}. For example[, a Malaysian scientist tried to
develop anthrax weapons for]{.underline} Osama [bin Laden]{.underline},
the founder of al-Qaeda.

While most countries have national guidelines for handling safety and
security threats, the examples described above highlight the global
implications of such threats. [It is therefore important to evaluate
global best practices, treaties, and conventions that deal with such
risks and devise strategies to update these safeguards to govern
dual-use applications of emerging biotechnologies]{.underline}.

#### Biotech is inevitable, we need to understand it to prevent bio-attacks.

Challenges for Governance" in *Emerging Threats of Synthetic Biology and
Biotechnology*, p. 1-2\]

[Synthetic biology uses engineering-based modeling and building
techniques to modify existing organisms]{.underline} and microbes or to
construct them from scratch. The rate of development and research
related to synthetic biology for both industry and academia has
increased over the past two decades (Ahteensuu 2017), with applications
in medicine (new vaccines, delivery of therapeutics, and treatments),
energy (biofuels), environmental remediation, food production, and
general industry (detergents, adhesives, perfumes) (Evans and Selgelid
2015; Gronvall 2015).

[While synthetic biology heralds advances in these fields]{.underline},
[its techniques could also be adapted for malicious purposes and used by
terrorist organizations, rogue actors, or hostile nations to create
dangerous pathogens, invasive organisms, or other disruptive biological
agents]{.underline} (Yeh et al. 2012). Such potential makes synthetic
biology a dual-use research area of concern (DURC) since the same
techniques can be used to benefit or harm people, animals, environments,
or nations (Getz and Dellaire 2018). Indeed, [there have been 35
confirmed cases of biological weapons deployment between 1970 and
2014]{.underline} (Franconi et al. 2018). Thus far, the use of advanced
biotechnologies for weapons production has mostly been pursued by
state-actors. However, [synthetic biological weapons are expected to
become a larger concern as the field advances and they become
increasingly adopted by **malicious** sub-state or **non-state
actors**]{.underline} (Gronvall 2018).

[Synthetic biology raises the possibility that pathogenic bioweapons
could be designed, developed, and deployed in new ways that diverge from
the disease causing characteristics of naturally occurring
pathogens]{.underline} (NAS 2018). Traditionally, only known pathogens
found naturally in the environment, such as B. anthracis and Y. pestis,
were developed as biological weapons because of the inherent infectious
characteristics that readily enabled such organisms to serve as weapons.
However, [as synthetic biology continues to expand its capabilities to
create and modify biological weapons, there is an increasing need for
biosafety and biosecurity assurances for humans, animals, plants, and
the environment]{.underline}. To cope with threats arising from
synthetic biology's dual-use nature, [biosecurity is needed to prevent,
detect, and determine the source of biological attacks]{.underline}.

Biological weapons created from synthetic biology represent a new and
unique threat space. Potential threats from synthetic biology include
increased pathogen transmissibility between and within species in
addition to resistance to established treatments. Synthetic biology can
be used to engineer normally benign microbes that produce toxic
biological compounds or re-build extinct or hard-to-obtain pathogens
from scratch (NAS 2018). The main biotechnologies of concern in the near
future (over the course of the next decade or so) are projected to be
oligonucleotide synthesis, DNA assembly (assembling multiple smaller
fragments of oligonucleotides into the desired larger sequence), and
genetic modification (editing, deleting, and inserting desired sequences
into targeted sites of a genome). Harm may also arise through the
purposeful use of these techniques to disrupt human and environmental
systems. Malevolent use, but also negligent use (misuse) of synthetic
biology techniques, require two circumstances: (a) the spread of
information, techniques, or knowhow to utilize synthetic biology's
enabling technologies for irresponsible or nefarious purposes
("information hazard"), and (b) the ability to use such knowledge and
tools to generate and disseminate harmful engineered organisms to
vulnerable recipients. [Creating effective biosecurity procedures and
policies to protect humans, agriculture, technology, and the environment
from such nefarious usages]{.underline} (or accidental or negligent
damage from misuse) [will require understanding the current state of
synthetic biology. This includes knowing the platforms and technologies
available for manipulation or construction]{.underline} (e.g., viruses,
microbes, multi-cellular organisms, or cell-free systems) [and planning
for the future as the field overcomes identified bottlenecks or
roadblocks. Biosecurity will require developing screening mechanisms for
synthetic pathogens and biological attacks]{.underline}, as well as
methods to assess how a synthetic pathogen could be dispersed during an
attack, [identify what the potential targets of the attack are, and
identify who developed the bioweapon]{.underline}.

#### Bioterror causes [extinction]{.underline} and is [likely]{.underline}.

**Pedersen '17**---Pepperdine University \[Christian, "Reflecting Back
on the Ebola Outbreak and the Future of Bioterrorism," Pepperdine Policy
Review: Vol. 9, dml\]

[Terror groups like **al-Qaeda** and **ISIL**]{.underline} (the Islamic
State of Iraq and the Levant) [have **expressed interested**, and have
even **attempted**, to **use biological agents** in terror
plots]{.underline} (Biodefense, 2016). [The **technical** and
**administrative knowledge** of biology and chemistry can be **acquired
globally** in **medical schools**, **research programs**, and
**laboratories**, making it **difficult** to **prevent potential
practitioners** of bioterrorism from **acquiring the required scientific
knowledge**]{.underline} (Chiodo, 2015). [While at one time the ability
to mutate strands was **restricted** to advanced research laboratories,
**rudimentary high school laboratories** now have the ability to develop
**deadly biological agents**]{.underline} (Garrett, 2012). With relative
easy, terror groups could engineer the flu virus, making it deadlier
(Selk, 2017). By combining traits of multiple strains and maximizing the
virus' natural properties, it could become highly transmittable (Farmer,
2107). **[Genetically engineered viruses have the potential to kill more
people than nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, governments remain
underprepared for that threat (Selk, 2017).

[Terrorists could be drawn to the use of biological agents because of
the **difficulty of detection** and the **ease** at which some
biological agents can **naturally spread** through a
population]{.underline} (Bioterrorism, 2006). There are essentially
three ways which [agents]{.underline} could be acquired by terrorist:
they [could be **stolen**, **created in laboratory environments**, or
**collected naturally**]{.underline}. A gloomy reality is that [as the
advancement of new technologies **reduce the costs of genetic
sequencing**, it will become **easier** and **less expensive** to create
novel organisms]{.underline} (Garrett, 2012). [Bioterrorist attacks can
be planned to **induce maximum damage** and **panic** with a **minimum
risk of early detection**]{.underline}. Potential agents of attack are
categorized by risk (rated as an, A, B, or a C) depending on the agent's
availability, ease of dissemination and transmission, and potential
impact (Bioterrorism, 2006). Category A agents are considered the most
dangerous and threatening to National Security. Ebola is categorized as
a Category A bioagent because of its ability to cause mass panic and
disruption and the special public health actions required for treating
those infected.

Through the EVD, "mother nature has created the perfect bioweapon"
(Thiessen, 2014). Following the Paris terrorist attacks, the French have
warned that terrorist organizations may attempt to steal [biological
agents]{.underline} (Talent & Graham, 2016). The British Ministry of
Defense feared terrorists would try to acquire EVD and released a report
outlining three separate scenarios in which terror groups could
successfully weaponize the virus. (Quinn, 2015) These [could be
**stolen** from **research facilities**, **laboratories**, or
**government stockpiles**. While the more exotic and devastating
agents]{.underline} (such as small pox) [must be cultivated in
laboratory environments and are therefore more difficult to obtain,
**many biological agents** are **naturally occurring**]{.underline}
(Gottron, 2002). [Examples of these naturally occurring, and **easier to
obtain agents** include]{.underline}: human immunodeficiency virus
(**[HIV]{.underline}**), [the **hepatitis strands**, **yellow fever**,
and]{.underline} the **[Ebola]{.underline}** virus (Gottron, 2002).
Moreover, [the Ebola virus is **native to a continent** where terrorist
organizations like **Boko Haram**, **Al-Qaeda**, and the **Islamic
State** are active]{.underline} (Thiessen, 2014). [The 21-day incubation
period allows potential jihadists **more than enough time** to infect
themselves, then travel to infected population centers, developing the
means of **mass distribution**]{.underline} (Thiessen, 2014).

In June 2001 -- months prior to the September 11th attack in New York --
Dark Winter[, a **senior level wargame**, was]{.underline} [run in
conjunction with security think tanks and government agencies to
simulate government responses to acts of bioterrorism]{.underline} (Dark
Winter). [The simulation demonstrated how a biological terror attack
could result in **mass civilian casualties**, **civil disorder**,
**institutional breakdown** and **lack of faith in
government**]{.underline} -- compromising national security (Dark
Winter). Major challenges for policymakers included the many "fault
lines" which existed between governmental agencies, the levels of
government, private healthcare systems, and the public (Dark Winter).
[Breakdowns in centralized leadership and communication could **threaten
containment** and **control**]{.underline}. It was revealed that [the
**healthcare system** in the United States had **no surge abilities** to
prevent hospitals from **becoming overwhelmed** or to **meet the
heightened demand** for vaccinations]{.underline} (Dark Winter).
Finally, targeted communications and information management was
recognized as a challenge, both in working with the media and in
disseminating important information (Dark Winter). It became very clear
after the exercise that [the United States was **unprepared** for an act
of bioterrorism]{.underline}. In 2010, nearly ten years after the Dark
Winter exercise, a commission created to evaluate the national emergency
response capabilities gave the nation a failing grade on its ability to
respond to a bioterrorist threat (O'Grady, 2015).

#### Scenario 2 is biodiversity. 

#### Biotechnology can either be used to save biodiversity or save it -- it is a question of bioethics and regulation.

[The goal of a gene drive is to spread or suppress certain genes in a
wild population of organisms]{.underline}. It works by exploiting a
quirk of nature. In sexually reproducing species, most genes have a 50
percent chance of being passed from parent to child, as offspring
receive half their genes from each parent. As a result, [genetic
mutations normally spread only if they make an organism more likely to
survive or breed.]{.underline} But some genes have evolved mechanisms
that give them better than 50 percent odds of being passed [on. That
allows changes in those genes to proliferate quickly even if they have
no effect on evolutionary fitness**. Scientists can exploit this
tendency by using CRISPR**]{.underline} to insert genetic material into
the "selfish" part of an organism's genome, [ensuring that the new trait
will be passed on to most offspring]{.underline}, eventually spreading
through large populations.

This process could be exploited both to improve public health and to
promote economic development. [Scientists could use gene drives to break
disease transmission chains, eliminating the need to use costly and
harmful insecticides]{.underline}. For example, [researchers are looking
at using the technology to inhibit the transmission of Lyme bacteria
from mice to ticks]{.underline}, **[a move that could wipe out Lyme
disease among humans]{.underline}**, since humans can catch the disease
only from tick bites[. In agriculture, gene drives could immunize plants
against many kinds of pathogens]{.underline} [and curb or eliminate
populations of invasive animals]{.underline}, such as mice, [that
destroy crops]{.underline}. Researchers are working to develop a house
mouse that can give birth only to male offspring. If the altered mice
were released into the wild, female mice would gradually disappear and
the species would die off within the area in which the altered mice were
introduced.

[Gene drives could also reverse some worrying environmental
trends]{.underline}. Many amphibian species, such as frogs, toads, and
newts, have suffered catastrophic declines over the last few [decades.
If scientists introduced engineered genes that rendered amphibians
immune to common pathogens, any species could recover.]{.underline}

But alongside these benefits come serious risks. A gene drive gone wrong
could leave a species extinct or introduce dramatic and unintended
effects. Most gene drives would likely be limited to a single place,
such as an island or an isolated and containable area of land, at least
at first[. If a genetically modified animal or plant
escaped]{.underline}, however, [then the gene drive could spread
uncontrollably]{.underline}. And if a modified organism mated with a
member of another species, it could transmit the changes to new
populations. **[Entire species could be wiped out and ecosystems
upended]{.underline}**.

These risks are dramatic, but they are also far off. In part because the
research is at such an early stage, scientists disagree about how much
and what kind of regulation and guidance will be required. [So
governments should follow the principle of regulatory parsimony, which
dictates that they should impose only those restrictions necessary to
maintain ethical standards and public safety]{.underline}. Doing so will
maximize the scope of free scientific discovery in a way that is
consistent with serving the public good. [In the countries where much of
the research is taking place, before imposing new restrictions,
governments should rationalize the current system of
regulation]{.underline}. In the United States, for example, the
Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the
Environmental Protection Agency all share responsibility for different
aspects of field trials and commercial products. [They should harmonize
their biological safety guidelines for gene-drive studies]{.underline}.
On the international stage, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an
agreement among most of the world's countries that came into force in
2003, regulates genetically modified organisms, but the United States
has not signed it.

In lieu of formal regulations on gene drives, scientists could agree to
build safety measures into gene-drive systems, such as alterations that
would cancel out previous drives or gene modifications designed to grow
less frequent over time, so that successive generations would express
the gene less and less once the original problem has been sufficiently
ameliorated. [Researchers will also need to be transparent about their
work and consult local communities to gain consent before introducing
gene drives into the wild.]{.underline}

#### Biodiversity loss is a threat multiplier, it outweighs and triggers their impacts

**Torres 2016** -the founder of the X-Risks Institute, an affiliate
scholar at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies \[Phil,
\"Biodiversity loss: An existential risk comparable to climate change,\"
Apr 11,
thebulletin.org/biodiversity-loss-existential-risk-comparable-climate-change9329\]

According to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, the two greatest
existential threats to human civilization stem from climate change and
nuclear weapons. Both pose clear and present dangers to the perpetuation
of our species, and the increasingly dire climate situation and nuclear
arsenal modernizations in the United States and Russia were the most
significant reasons why the Bulletin decided to keep the Doomsday Clock
set at three minutes before midnight earlier this year. But [there is
another existential threat]{.underline} that the Bulletin overlooked in
its Doomsday Clock announcement[: biodiversity loss.]{.underline} This
phenomenon is often identified as one of the many consequences of
climate change, and this is of course correct. But [biodiversity loss is
also a contributing factor behind climate change.]{.underline} For
example[, deforestation]{.underline} in the Amazon rainforest and
elsewhere [reduces the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the
atmosphere]{.underline} by plants, a natural process that mitigates the
effects of climate change[. So the causal relation between climate
change and biodiversity loss is bidirectional.]{.underline} Furthermore,
there are myriad phenomena that are driving biodiversity loss in
addition to climate change. Other causes include ecosystem
fragmentation, invasive species, pollution, oxygen depletion caused by
fertilizers running off into ponds and streams, overfishing, human
overpopulation, and overconsumption. All of these phenomena have a
direct impact on the health of the biosphere, and all would conceivably
persist even if the problem of climate change were somehow immediately
solved. Such considerations warrant decoupling biodiversity loss from
climate change, because the former has been consistently subsumed by the
latter as a mere effect. [Biodiversity loss is a distinct environmental
crisis with its own unique syndrome of causes, consequences, and
solutions]{.underline}---such as restoring habitats, creating protected
areas ("biodiversity parks"), and practicing sustainable agriculture.
[The sixth extinction. The repercussions of biodiversity loss are
potentially as severe as those anticipated **from climate change, or
even a nuclear conflict**.]{.underline} For example, according to a 2015
study published in Science Advances, [the best available evidence
reveals "an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few
centuries,]{.underline} indicating that a sixth mass extinction [is
already under way."]{.underline} This conclusion holds, even on the most
optimistic assumptions about the background rate of species losses and
the current rate of vertebrate extinctions. The group classified as
"vertebrates" includes mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and all other
creatures with a backbone. The article argues that, using its
conservative figures, the average loss of vertebrate species was 100
times higher in the past century relative to the background rate of
extinction. (Other scientists have suggested that the current extinction
rate could be as much as 10,000 times higher than normal.) As the
authors write, "The evidence is incontrovertible that recent extinction
rates are unprecedented in human history and highly unusual in Earth's
history." Perhaps the term "Big Six" should enter the popular
lexicon---to add the current extinction to the previous "Big Five," the
last of which wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. But the
concept of biodiversity encompasses more than just the total number of
species on the planet. It also refers to the size of different
populations of species. With respect to this phenomenon, multiple
studies have confirmed that wild populations around the world are
dwindling and disappearing at an alarming rate. For example, the 2010
Global Biodiversity Outlook report found that the population of wild
vertebrates living in the tropics dropped by 59 percent between 1970 and
2006. The report also found that the population of farmland birds in
Europe has dropped by 50 percent since 1980; bird populations in the
grasslands of North America declined by almost 40 percent between 1968
and 2003; and the population of birds in North American arid lands has
fallen by almost 30 percent since the 1960s. Similarly, 42 percent of
all amphibian species (a type of vertebrate that is sometimes called an
"ecological indicator") are undergoing population declines, and 23
percent of all plant species "are estimated to be threatened with
extinction." Other studies have found that some 20 percent of all
reptile species, 48 percent of the world's primates, and 50 percent of
freshwater turtles are threatened. Underwater, about 10 percent of all
coral reefs are now dead, and another 60 percent are in danger of dying.
Consistent with these data, the 2014 Living Planet Report shows that the
global population of wild vertebrates dropped by 52 percent in only four
decades---from 1970 to 2010. While biologists often avoid projecting
historical trends into the future because of the complexity of
ecological systems, it's tempting to extrapolate this figure to, say,
the year 2050, which is four decades from 2010. As it happens, a 2006
study published in Science does precisely this: It projects past trends
of marine biodiversity loss into the 21st century, concluding that,
unless significant changes are made to patterns of human activity, there
will be virtually no more wild-caught seafood by 2048. Catastrophic
consequences for civilization. [The consequences of this rapid
pruning]{.underline} of the evolutionary tree of life extend beyond the
obvious. There [could be surprising effects of biodiversity loss that
scientists are unable to fully anticipate in advance.]{.underline} For
example, prior research has shown that [localized ecosystems can undergo
abrupt and irreversible shifts when they reach a tipping
point.]{.underline} According to a 2012 paper published in Nature, there
are reasons for thinking that we may be approaching a tipping point of
this sort in the global ecosystem, beyond which the consequences could
be catastrophic for civilization. As the authors write[, a
planetary-scale transition could precipitate "substantial losses of
ecosystem services required to sustain the human population." An
ecosystem service is any ecological process that benefits humanity, such
as food production and crop pollination. If the global ecosystem were to
cross a tipping point and substantial ecosystem services were lost, the
results could be "widespread social unrest, economic instability, and
loss of human]{.underline} life." According to Missouri Botanical Garden
ecologist Adam Smith, one of the paper's co-authors, this could occur in
a matter of decades---far more quickly than most of the expected
consequences of climate change, yet equally destructive. [Biodiversity
loss is a "threat multiplier" that,]{.underline} [by pushing societies
to the brink of collapse, will exacerbate existing conflicts and
introduce entirely new struggles between state and non-state
actors.]{.underline} Indeed, [it could even fuel the rise of
terrorism]{.underline}. (After all, climate change has been linked to
the emergence of ISIS in Syria, and multiple high-ranking US officials,
such as former US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and CIA director John
Brennan, have affirmed that climate change and terrorism are connected.)
The reality is that we are entering the sixth mass extinction in the
3.8-billion-year history of life on Earth, and the impact of this event
could be felt by civilization "in as little as three human lifetimes,"
as the aforementioned 2012 Nature paper notes. Furthermore, the
widespread decline of biological populations could plausibly initiate a
dramatic transformation of the global ecosystem on an even faster
timescale: perhaps a single human lifetime. [The unavoidable conclusion
is that biodiversity loss constitutes an existential threat in its own
right.]{.underline} As such, [it ought to be considered alongside
climate change and nuclear weapons as one of the most significant
contemporary risks to human prosperity and survival.]{.underline}

[Scientific developments in biotechnology can offer solutions to address
global challenges]{.underline} [such as combating the spread of
infectious diseases, reducing hunger, and remediating environmental
degradation]{.underline}.

Biotechnology has the potential to create novel diagnostics, vaccines,
drugs, and other medical countermeasures needed to detect, prevent, and
treat infectious diseases. For example, the coronavirus pandemic has
highlighted the promising role that biotechnology can play in this way.
Researchers around the globe are actively working to combat the
pandemic. They have been using different technologies to develop cheap
diagnostics, repurpose existing antivirals, discover new drugs, and
create safe and effective vaccines. In addition, biotechnology can be
used to create genetically engineered organisms that can be deliberately
introduced into the environment for purposes such as mosquito control.
As an example, [advances in genome engineering
technologies]{.underline}---such as clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9
(Cas9)---[have enabled the development of gene drives, a technology that
allows desired genetic alterations to spread faster through a population
over many generations]{.underline}. [This technique can be used to cure
vector-borne human diseases such as malaria and dengue fever by either
making mosquitoes resistant to the parasites that cause these diseases
or by completely wiping out disease-carrying mosquito
populations]{.underline}.

[Agricultural biotechnology can be used to create genetically modified
crops for combating hunger and malnutrition. Traditional biotechnology
techniques such as selective breeding, hybridization, and fermentation
have been modifying living plants for improved yield or enhanced
nutritional value from time immemorial.]{.underline} However, with
improvements in knowledge about the role of individual plant genes,
[modern biotechnology techniques can be used to add, delete, or edit
specific genes to produce a desired variety]{.underline}, thereby
reducing the possibility of off-target effects. For example, golden
rice, an engineered variety of rice, contains two extra genes to make it
produce beta-carotene, a precursor to Vitamin A, that can help address
nutrient deficiencies that lead to blindness, anemia, and weakened

develop genetically modified crops that withstand natural calamities,
pests, and diseases. Such varieties can increase crop yields, lessen the
need to use pesticides and insecticides, lift farmers out of poverty,
and **ensure food security**]{.underline}. Beyond [that, biotechnology
can help produce healthier and faster-growing animals and improve the

consumption]{.underline}.

Violent Conflict: Causes, Consequences, and Addressing the Challenges;
World Food Programme, Occassional Paper 24; July

[Rising food prices contribute to food insecurity, which is
a]{.underline} clear and [serious threat to human security]{.underline}.
[Interest in food security as a catalyst for political instability and
conflict]{.underline} has grown rapidly since 2007--2008, when food
protests and riots broke out in 48 countries as a result of record world
prices. In February 2011, the food price index of the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reached a new
historic peak, and the rise in food prices contributed to the wave of
protests across North Africa and the Middle East that toppled Tunisian
president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.
Among major development organizations, [the unchallenged consensus is
that war and conflict are development issues: conflict ravages local
economies, often leading to forced migration, refugee populations,
disease, a collapse of social trust, and acute food insecurity. But is
food insecurity itself a cause of conflict?]{.underline} Based on a
review of recent research, [the answer is a highly qualified
yes.]{.underline} [Food insecurity,]{.underline} especially [when caused
by higher food prices, heightens the risk of democratic breakdown, civil
conflict, protest, rioting, and communal conflict.]{.underline} The
evidence linking food insecurity to interstate conflict is less strong,
though there is some historical evidence linking declining agricultural
yields to periods of regional conflict in Europe and Asia. These links
are highly context-specific: they are contingent on existing political
institutions, levels of economic development, social safety nets and
demographic pressures. Food insecurity is neither a necessary nor
sufficient condition for acute political violence and conflict.
Generally, the risk of violent conflict is higher where political
regimes intermingle democratic and authoritarian institutions or when a
youth bulge, low levels of development, deteriorating economic
conditions, or high inequalities among groups are present. [Fragile
states]{.underline} (which have a high share of food imports), and the
households within them (who must spend a large share of their income on
food), [are particularly vulnerable to higher food prices.]{.underline}
Moreover, this vulnerability has increased over time. On the other hand,
violent conflicts have also contributed to higher food prices and food
insecurity, contributing to a vicious cycle. While the situation seems
bleak, the contingent nature of food insecurity's effect on conflict
suggests that governments, international organizations (IOs), and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can take positive steps to reduce
food insecurity and break the relationship between food insecurity and
conflict[. Governments can act to shield their citizens from higher
prices and volatility in world markets by initiating measures to
stabilize food prices and by establishing social protection systems that
mitigate the impact of high food prices on vulnerable
groups.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [the capacity of fragile states to
do that is limited.]{.underline} The World Food Programme and NGOs can
assist in times of acute crisis to provide relief. Finally, governments,
IOs and NGOs can work to make food security a part of the post-conflict
peacebuilding and reconstruction process. [The challenges are great, but
the potential social, economic, and political costs of inaction are even
greater.]{.underline}

#### Transatlantic cooperation is necessary to unlock the potential of GMOs

**Giddings \'22**- senior fellow at ITIF \[L Val, Mar 11, \"Prospects
for Transatlantic Cooperation in Biotech Policy---A US Perspective,\"
https://itif.org/publications/2022/03/11/prospects-transatlantic-cooperation-biotech-policy-us-perspective/\]

A WORLD OF BIOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES

Mutual self-interest provides a strong basis for transatlantic
cooperation in biotechnology based on shared recognition of its vast
potential to provide solutions to some of civilization's most pressing
problems. Thanks to explosive advances in our understanding of the many
ways in which promiscuous nature has been manipulating DNA and RNA for
the past billion years[, it is widely anticipated that the 21st century
will belong to biology]{.underline}.1 We are now at the point where our
[ability to innovate is constrained less by technical capability than by
the limits of our imaginations]{.underline}. Multiple laboratories and
companies on both sides of the Atlantic (and throughout the world) are
pursuing promising applications, and experience confirms progress would
be accelerated by cooperative approaches. But [there are some
considerable challenges, especially in agricultural and industrial
contexts.]{.underline}

[The most important rate-limiting factor in our ability to harness
biological innovations to the challenges of feeding the world,
sustaining human and environmental health, and addressing climate
change, is the burden imposed by ill-considered
regulations]{.underline}. **[Unless this bottleneck can be
unblocked]{.underline}**, [the enormous potential for transatlantic
scientific cooperation will not yield the necessary fruits]{.underline}.

DIVERGENT REGULATORY PATHS: PRECAUTION VS. OPENNESS TO INNOVATION

[Existing policies, legislation, and regulations do little or nothing to
advance human or environmental safety]{.underline}.2 Born out of
understandable caution at the dawn of recombinant DNA technologies[,
today their most obvious impact is to obstruct and discourage research,
development, and deployment of innovative solutions to various
challenges]{.underline}.3 This is so despite an abundant record of
production and consumption of new biotech products with enviable records
of improved safety, superior sustainability, and widespread beneficial
economic impacts.4 The benefits are so substantial that a pattern has
emerged of farmers breaking the law to acquire and plant improved seeds
in countries where governments have lagged in allowing access.5

[It is one thing to implement policies and regulations ostensibly
designed to ensure safety; it is quite another to ignore vast data and
decades of experience around the world to maintain obsolete policies and
regulations that add nothing to safety or sustainability]{.underline},
but only impede our ability to use the most innovative, precise, and
safest tools to address our gravest challenges.6

In terms of regulatory policy and openness to biological innovations,
[the width of the Atlantic might be measured better in light years than
miles or kilometers. As imperfect as regulations for the products of
biotechnology are in North America, they are simply indefensible in
Europe]{.underline}.7

The United States decided in 1986, after years of study and
consultation, that no new laws were required to ensure the safety of
crops and foods improved through biotechnology. This was based on the
finding that they present no novel hazards, and foreseeable risks of
their development and use fall into categories with which humans have
considerable experience from millennia of conventional plant and animal
breeding.8 The United States therefore decided to regulate these novel
products under existing authorities administered by the Department of
Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and Environmental
Protection Agency.9 While implementation of this policy, the
"Coordinated Framework," has been far from perfect, it has been
sufficiently predictable and science-based to enable an explosion of
innovation, new product development, and commercial activity.
Consequently, the United States has led the world to the present day
wherein crops improved through biotechnology are now the global standard
for quality seeds, delivering improved yields, safety, sustainability,
and economic productivity around the world, with the lion's share of
benefits accruing on behalf of small farmers in developing countries.10
Europe took a different approach.

It is one thing to implement policies and regulations ostensibly
designed to ensure safety; it is quite another to ignore vast data and
decades of experience around the world to maintain obsolete policies and
regulations that add nothing to safety or sustainability.

The European Union decided to regulate seeds improved through
biotechnology as a novel class governed under new regulations
specifically focused on an arbitrary category known as "GMOs" (for
"genetically modified organisms"). The conceit was that because they
represented gene combinations produced by mechanisms supposedly "not
found in nature" (but actually ubiquitous) they must present novel
hazards, even though none has ever been identified. These putatively
novel hazards, despite the lack of any concrete manifestations,
allegedly required dedicated, specific, "precautionary" regulations.
[The resulting regulatory regime proved so burdensome it led to the
general collapse of agricultural biotechnology in Europe, which had
played a leading role in its discovery and invention]{.underline}.
[Permissions for field trials proved almost impossible to obtain,
products could not be developed and brought to market]{.underline},
academic labs abandoned the field, and the industry relocated most of
its assets and activities to the Americas. And Europe became the world's
largest importer of commodity foods improved through biotechnology, only
recently surpassed by China.

OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSATLANTIC COOPERATION

[Many scientists in the EU]{.underline} (and around the world) [knew
from the beginning that this was the wrong approach, yet the EU pushed
its model internationally, with aggressive diplomacy, leading to
emulation by many countries in the developing world, with equally
unhappy results to those seen in Europe]{.underline}.11 But [a growing
number of scientists, policymakers,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} even
"[green" NGOs that had originally opposed GMOs, now recognize the
counterproductive results of this approach and are working to avoid
repeating the same mistakes with gene editing]{.underline}. This shines
a spotlight on the most important and potentially fruitful opportunity
for transatlantic cooperation in biotechnology: the revival of
science-based regulatory regimes in which the degree of regulatory
oversight is proportional to the hazards involved, and regulation that
enables, rather than discourages the safe development of innovative
products[. A return to and reaffirmation of these first principles would
provide fertile ground for cooperation and coordination
globally]{.underline}. [Regulatory reform]{.underline} (everywhere, not
just in the EU and its emulators, though the need is greatest there)
[provides fertile ground for transatlantic cooperation and
coordination]{.underline}. We have robust models of proven approaches.12
[Without such cooperation, other progress in developing and deploying
innovative solutions through biotechnology will be impeded or
foregone]{.underline}.

As to national security risks, just as with other risks, novelty
attributable to biotechnology is elusive. [One can do very nasty things
with conventional bioweapons,]{.underline} and they are easily magnified
with recombinant DNA techniques. At the same time, [defensive capacities
are also buttressed by biotechnology, as demonstrated by the rapid
development of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.]{.underline} There has
been some good work done in this area, but this topic is worth exploring
at greater depth. The OECD has a track record of thoughtful analyses
with such topics. [One possibility would be to build on that foundation
by establishing a joint OECD/NATO working group to serve as a
forum]{.underline}.

#### A coordinated framework is necessary to check the dual-use aspects of biotech. 

**Cummings \'21** \[Christopher L., Kaitlin M. Volk, Anna A. Ulanova, Do
Thuy Uyen Ha Lam & Pei Rou Ng, "Emerging Biosecurity Threats and
Responses: A Review of Published and Gray Literature" in *Emerging
Threats of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology*, pp 13--36\]

Biosecurity threats include biological weapons and accidental releases
as demonstrated in the Sverdlovsk anthrax event, but they have also
become more diversified and complicated as researchers develop and
utilize advanced biotechnology techniques for the betterment of society
across other sectors. [Gene drives for mosquito population control,
engineered algae for biofuel creation, and recreation of extinct
pathogens for novel vaccine development have unique and potentially
unknown associated risks]{.underline}. [The envisioned coordinated
biosecurity framework would allow for beneficial innovation to
proliferate while simultaneously reducing anticipated and unanticipated
risk of harm to humans, animals, agricultural, and the
environment]{.underline} (Trump et al. 2020b; Wells et al. 2020).

### 1AC - Leadership

#### China is a posed to take the lead on biotech -- risking planetary survival.

Sarah Sewall, \"The Innovation Wars America's Eroding Technological
Advantage,\"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-10/technology-innovation-wars\]

[China's hunger for data extends to some of the most personal
information imaginable]{.underline}: our own DNA. Since the COVID-19
pandemic began, BGI---a Chinese genome-sequencing company that began as
a government-funded research group---has broken ground on some 50 new
laboratories abroad designed to help governments test for the virus.
China has legitimate reasons to build these labs, but [it also **has an
ugly record of forcibly collecting DNA** data from Tibetans and Uighurs
as part of its efforts to monitor these minorities.]{.underline} Given
that BGI runs China's national library of genomics data, it is
conceivable that through BGI testing, foreigners' biological data might
end up in that repository.

Indeed, [China has shown great interest in biotechnology]{.underline},
even if it has yet to catch up to the United States[. Combined with
massive computing power and artificial intelligence, innovations in
biotechnology could help solve some of humanity's most vexing
challenges, from disease and famine to energy production and climate
change. R]{.underline}esearchers have mastered the gene-editing tool
CRISPR, allowing them to grow wheat that resists disease, and have
managed to encode video in the DNA of bacteria, raising the possibility
of a new, cost-effective method of data storage. Specialists in
synthetic biology have invented a new way of producing nylon---with
genetically engineered microorganisms instead of petrochemicals. The
economic implications of the coming biotechnology revolution are
staggering: the McKinsey Global Institute has estimated the value of
biotechnology's many potential applications at up to \$4 trillion over
the next ten to 20 years.

Like all powerful technologies, however, [biotechnology has a dark
side.]{.underline} It is not inconceivable, for example[, that some
malicious actor could create a biological weapon that targeted a
specific ethnic group]{.underline}. On controversial questions---such as
how much manipulation of the human genome is acceptable---countries will
accept different degrees of risk in the name of progress and take
different ethical positions. [The country that **leads biotechnology's
development** will be the **one that most profoundly shapes the norms
and standards around its use**. And there is reason to worry if that
country is China]{.underline}. In 2018, the Chinese scientist He Jiankui
genetically engineered the DNA of twin babies, prompting an
international uproar. Beijing portrayed him as a rogue researcher and
punished him. Yet [the Chinese government's disdain for human rights,
coupled with its quest for technological supremacy, suggests that it
could embrace a lax, even dangerous approach to bioethics.]{.underline}

THINKING BIGGER

Washington has monitored China's technological progress through a
military lens, worrying about how it contributes to Chinese defense
capabilities. But the challenge is much broad[er. China's push for
technological supremacy is not simply aimed at gaining a battlefield
advantage; Beijing is changing the battlefield itself]{.underline}.
Although commercial technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence,
quantum computing, and biotechnology will undoubtedly have military
applications, [China envisions a world of great-power competition in
which no shots need to be fired. Technological supremacy promises the
ability to dominate the civilian infrastructure on which others depend,
providing enormous influence.]{.underline} That is a major motivation
behind Beijing's support for high-tech civilian infrastructure exports[.
The countries buying Chinese systems may think they are merely receiving
electric grids]{.underline}, health-care technology, or online payment
systems, [but in reality, they may also be placing critical national
infrastructure and citizens' data in Beijing's hands]{.underline}.
**[Such exports are China's Trojan horse.]{.underline}**

Despite the changing nature of geopolitical competition, the United
States still tends to equate security with traditional defense
capabilities. Consider microelectronics. They are critical components
not only for a range of commercial products but also for virtually every
major defense system, from aircraft to warships. Because they will power
advances in artificial intelligence, they will also shape the United
States' future economic competitiveness. Yet investment in
microelectronics has fallen through the cracks. Neither the private
sector nor the government is adequately funding innovation---the former
due to the large capital requirements and long time horizons involved
and the latter because it has focused more on securing current supplies
than on innovating. Although China has had a hard time catching up to
the United States in this area, it is only a matter of time before it
moves up the microelectronics value chain.

Another casualty of the United States' overly narrow conception of
security and innovation is 5G technology. By dominating this market,
China has built a global telecommunications network that can serve
geopolitical purposes. One fear is that Beijing could help itself to
data running on 5G networks. Another is the possibility that China might
sabotage or disrupt adversaries' communications networks in a crisis.
Most U.S. policymakers failed to predict the threat posed by Chinese 5G
infrastructure. It wasn't until 2019 that Washington sounded the alarm
about Huawei, but by then, there was little it could do. U.S. companies
had never offered an end-to-end wireless network, instead focusing on
manufacturing individual components, such as handsets and routers. Nor
had any developed its own radio access network, a system for sending
signals across network devices that is needed to build an end-to-end 5G
system like that offered by Huawei and a few other companies. As a
result, the United States found itself in an absurd situation:
threatening to end intelligence cooperation if close allies adopted
Huawei's 5G technology without having an attractive alternative to
offer.

Digital infrastructure may be today's battle, but [biotechnology will
likely be the next. Unfortunately, it,]{.underline} too, is [not
considered a priority within the U.S. government]{.underline}. The
Department of Defense has understandably shown little interest in it.
Part of the explanation for that lies in the fact that the United
States, like many other countries, has signed a treaty renouncing
biological weapons. Still, [biotechnology has other implications for the
Pentagon, from changing manufacturing to improving the health of service
personnel]{.underline}. More important, any [comprehensive assessment of
the national interest must recognize biotechnology's implications for
ethics, the economy, health, **and planetary survival.**]{.underline}

#### They will cooperate with Russia -- enabling Russian biotech to take off.

University Institute \[Svitlana, May 9, \"The Rise of Sino-Russian
Biotech Cooperation,\"
https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/the-rise-of-sino-russian-biotech-cooperation/\]

Biotechnology

[Chinese-Russian technological alignment has been particularly apparent
in the sector of biotechnology]{.underline}. Broadly, biotechnology
refers to the manipulation of living organisms or their compounds to
produce new products or services. Biotechnology is perceived to be "a
key strategic technology for industrial growth" and is distinguished
from other technological sectors for its capacity to alter the means of
production across a variety of industrial sectors.\[13\] Examples of the
sectors include pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and food processing, and
extend to dual-use technologies.

[Biotechnology is a strategic sector for China]{.underline}. [The Made
in China 2025 Initiative sets the goal of manufacturing high-tech
products, including innovative medicines]{.underline}.\[14\] The plan
introduced targets for Chinese pharmaceutical firms to advance in
biotechnology innovation and increase exports.\[15\] About half of all
industrial parks in China focus on the development of
pharmaceuticals.\[16\] By 2018, China established 111 biotechnology
science parks.\[17\] Although China still lags behind the U.S. in
biotechnology innovation, analysts concede that it is rapidly
progressing and closing this gap.\[18\] So far, [China's efforts have
concentrated on creating the necessary infrastructure for biotechnology
development]{.underline}.

In turn, [Russia has rich natural resources, but over 80% of biotech
products are imported]{.underline}, and Russia's share in the global
market of biotech products is below 0.1%.\[19\] Russian biotech is a
sector that experienced massive brain drain after the break-up of the
Soviet Union, with many scientists leaving for Western countries and
Israel.\[20\] The [persistent challenge for the Russian biotechnology
industry, including the biopharmaceutical industry, is its critical
dependency on imports]{.underline}. Between 1992 and 2014, the
production of substances (active pharmaceutical ingredients) decreased
by a factor of 20.\[21\] According to the Ministry of Industrial Policy
of Russia, in 2015, the country imported 95% of active pharmaceutical
ingredients required to produce finished pharmaceuticals.\[22\] In 2018,
the share of foreign medicines on the Russian market constituted 70.2%
by value and 39.4% by volume. In 2019, foreign medicines generated USD
19.6 billion in income, which was about 70% of the Russian
pharmaceutical market.\[23\] By some accounts, this sum is larger than
what Russia earns from its arms export.\[24\] Pharmaceutical imports
exceed exports by 14 times.\[25\] By all formal indicators in
life-science research and biotechnology, such as gross domestic product
(GDP) expenditure on R&D, patents, and journal publications, Russia lags
behind the United States, China, France, South Korea, Japan, Germany,
and India.\[26\]

Yet**[, Russia sees biotechnology as a priority area for its
future]{.underline}**.\[27\] The first post-Soviet strategic document in
this area was enacted in 2012 and entitled the State Coordination
Program for the Development of Biotechnology in the Russian Federation
until 2020 (BIO 2020). Around USD 18 million was invested in the
development of biotechnology, with 22% directed to biomedicine and
biopharmaceuticals research.\[28\] The results of the program are
considered limited, except for some improvement in vaccine and
monoclonal antibodies research.\[29\] The state programs in the
pharmaceutical industry appear to be more specific and thus more
practical.

For example, the State Program for the Development of the Pharmaceutical
and Medical Industry until 2020 (PHARMA 2020), published in 2014,
attempted to reduce Russia's dependency on foreign medical technologies.
Sanctions put added pressure on import substitution in this area.\[30\]
As a result of this program, 50 new industrial sites were built, 130 new
medicines entered the market (9 of which were classified as innovative),
and 8 scientific-research centers of pre-clinical development were built
or reconstructed.\[31\] In addition, PHARMA 2020 launched several
biopharmaceutical projects, including those of Biocad and
Generium,\[32\] some of the largest producers of the Sputnik V
vaccine.\[33\]

Moscow approved PHARMA 2030 in December 2021. The main difference
between PHARMA 2020 and PHARMA 2030 is a call for an upgrade from import
substitution to an innovative model of production. In nine years, Russia
aims to double the production of local medicines and medical equipment
and increase their export. The program foresees investment in
infrastructure to allow for deepening cooperation between production,
science, and education.\[34\]

According to data from the Eurasian Economic Commission, Russia's
innovative companies include few active players: Generium, ChemRar,
Biocad, and Pharmapark.\[35\] ChemRar, a high-tech center in the Moscow
region, hosts a handful companies benefiting from its infrastructure and
scientific-research institute. One of the objectives of the center is
conducting R&D for its partners especially around innovative
antibiotics. In 2020, ChemRar, with the help of the Russian Direct
Investment Fund (RDIF), developed a specific medicine for
anti-coronavirus treatment, Avifavir, which is currently supplied to 15
countries.\[36\] Avifavir is based on a known substance Favipiravir,
originally developed in Japan to treat influenza, but ChemRar conducted
clinical trials to confirm its effectiveness in treating COVID-19
specifically. Pharmapark, another Moscow-based company, is Russia's top
producer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient interferon alfa-2b and
covers 80% of local demand of Russian producers of finished
pharmaceuticals. Some of these companies are becoming instrumental in
Sino-Russian biotech partnership.

Wh[en it comes to breakthroughs, what is notable about the Russian
biopharma industry is the persistent Soviet legacy of production being
subordinated to research institutes.]{.underline} By estimates, [about
30 universities,]{.underline} mostly in Moscow and Saint Petersburg,
have [programs in biotechnology, and about 50 institutes of the Russian
Academy of Science conduct biology research]{.underline}.\[37\] Consider
the Russian COVID-19 vaccines as an example. [The Sputnik V vaccine came
out from the Gamaleya Institute, a state-owned research institute, not
from industry]{.underline}. The Novosibirsk-based state-owned scientific
center, Vektor State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology,
developed the EpiVacCorona vaccine.\[38\] Similarly, state-owned
Chumakov Scientific Center for Research and Development of
Immune-and-Biological Products of Russian Academy of Sciences developed
the KoviVac vaccine.\[39\]

Arguably, Russia's weak point is not in the development of
biopharmaceutical innovation but in scaling-up of production. [In the
biotechnology sector, innovative projects are financially supported
through Russian development institutes,]{.underline} such as Skolkovo,
Russian Venture Company, and Rusnano.\[40\] Often, their resources only
suffice for the development stage but not for substantially increasing
production. For the latter, the Russian Foreign Direct Investment Fund
plays a bigger role, but it would be limited without help from its
international partners. This is where China's resources find a good
application.

Notwithstanding the respective limitations of national biotech
industries, [Russia and China's cooperation has recently intensified and
involved the use of the joint innovation infrastructure projects
mentioned above]{.underline}. For example, Russian company Biocad,\[41\]
together with Chinese manufacturer Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding
(SPH), created a joint venture, SPH Biocad, based in China. SPH Biocad
will commercialize Biocad's portfolio of medicines (e.g., oncology and
autoimmune treatment) in the Chinese market.\[42\] The joint venture
received USD 400 million in funding, in which SPH holds 50.1% and Biocad
49.9%.\[43\] The long-term plan is to turn the joint venture from a
generic producer into an innovative player.\[44\]

[Another example of the use of the joint innovation infrastructure to
advance biopharmaceutical cooperation is the Russia-China Investment
Fund.]{.underline} In 2020, [it invested in the creation of the Russian
pharmaceutical holding Binnopharm Group]{.underline}.\[45\] In the same
year, Binnopharm Group joined a group of companies involved in the
production of the Sputnik V vaccine. With consolidated assets,
Binnopharm Group became one of the top three largest pharmaceutical
manufacturers in Russia and now owns the portfolio of over 450
registered medicines, the most among Russian companies.\[46\] Binnopharm
Group plans to establish a new R&D center in Krasnogorsk (Moscow region)
by integrating R&D centers of the enterprises that were merged and
invest USD 33 million in the development of 100 new medicines by
2025.\[47\] The impact on biopharmaceutical innovation of this merger is
yet to be seen. Evidently though, China has been behind the major
projects aiming to help Russia create and improve the necessary
infrastructure for the development of biopharmaceuticals industry.
[Infrastructure for innovation-based industries, such as biotechnology,
is a key pillar, and China's kind of investment in Russia is aimed to
develop and upgrade the necessary innovation capabilities.]{.underline}

[In addition to joint investments, China and Russia have launched
bilateral research projects]{.underline}. The countries agreed to
establish a joint laboratory for research on COVID-19. The National Fund
of Natural Sciences of China and the Russian Fund of Fundamental
Research will supervise the project.\[48\] In a similar vein, the
Russian Vektor State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology have
cooperated with the Ministry of Science and Technology of China on
projects related to the human avian influenza (bird flu).\[49\] The
exchange of vaccine technology and declarations to combine efforts in
coronavirus research accelerated the formation of the institutional
links between the Chinese and Russian innovation systems, especially in
the biotechnology sector. It signals the countries' commitment to an
enduring innovation partnership.\[50\]

Conclusion

The processes addressed in this paper have been unfolding before the war
in Ukraine[. Western decoupling from China and Russia has been pushing
the two countries towards deepening their cooperation]{.underline}. [The
accelerating Sino-Russian innovation cooperation projects confirm this
assumption. While it can be premature to assess the levels of joint
biopharmaceutical innovation, the implications of China's engagement
with the Russian biotech are not trivial]{.underline}. The nature of
this engagement goes beyond investment projects, [aiming to strengthen
the institutional links between research organizations, manufacturers,
and sovereign funds of the two nations]{.underline}. After February 24,
2022, Western sanctions and companies fleeing Russia will force Moscow
to seek deeper cooperation with China in high-tech sectors. [Russian
biotech is not a self-sufficient industry and requires international
partnerships to develop. But Russia is now limited in who it can partner
with.]{.underline} Given the past trajectory of joint innovation
partnership, naturally, **[China is now Russia's ultimate bet when it
comes to biotechnology]{.underline}** development[. Russian biotech
future is in China's hands]{.underline}. There are not currently signs
that China will change its favorable position towards Russia; hence,
[Sino-Russian innovation partnerships will likely
intensify]{.underline}.

[The system must]{.underline} also [be adapted to deal with]{.underline}
new issues that were not envisioned when the existing order was
designed. Foremost among these issues is [emerging and disruptive
technology, including **AI**, **additive manufacturing**]{.underline}
(or **[3D printing]{.underline}**), [quantum computing]{.underline},
[**genetic engineering**, **robotics**, **directed energy**,
the]{.underline} Internet of things ([**IOT**), **5G**, **space**,
**cyber**]{.underline}, and many others. Like other disruptive
technologies before them, [these innovations promise great benefits, but
also carry **serious downside risks**]{.underline}. For example, AI is
already resulting in massive efficiencies and cost savings in the
private sector. Routine tasks and other more complicated jobs, such as
radiology, are already being automated. In the future, autonomous
weapons systems may go to war against each other as human soldiers
remain out of harm's way.

Yet, [AI is]{.underline} also transforming economies and societies, and
[generating new security challenges]{.underline}. Automation will lead
to widespread unemployment. The final realization of driverless cars,
for example, will put out of work millions of taxi, Uber, and long-haul
truck drivers. Populist movements in the West have been driven by those
disaffected by globalization and technology, and mass unemployment
caused by automation will further grow those ranks and provide new fuel
to grievance politics. Moreover, some fear that [autonomous
weapons]{.underline} systems will become "killer robots" that select and
engage targets without human input, and [could eventually **turn on
their creators, resulting in human extinction**. The other technologies
on this lisgt similarly balance great potential upside with great
downside risk. 3D printing]{.underline}, for example, can be used to
"make anything anywhere," reducing costs for a wide range of
manufactured goods and encouraging a return of local manufacturing
industries.61 At the same time, advanced 3D printers [can]{.underline}
also [be used by revisionist and rogue states to print component parts

Perhaps [the greatest risk to global strategic stability from new

**[revisionist autocracies may win the new tech arms

commanding heights of technological progress have also dominated
international relations. The United States has been the world's
innovation leader from Edison's light bulb to nuclear weapons and the
Internet. Accordingly, [stability has been maintained in Europe and
Asia]{.underline} for decades [because the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and its democratic allies possessed a
favorable economic and military balance of power]{.underline} in those
key regions. Many believe, however, that China may now have the lead
[in]{.underline} the new technologies of the twenty-first century,
including [AI, quantum, 5G, **hypersonic missiles**, and others. If
China succeeds in mastering the technologies of the future before the
democratic core]{.underline}, then [this could lead to a drastic and
rapid shift in the balance of power, upsetting global strategic
stability, and the call for a democratic- led, **rules-based
system**]{.underline} outlined in these pages.63

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and its

a wide range of agreements for harnessing the technologies of the
twentieth century, but they need to be updated for the twenty-first
century. The world needs an entire new set of arms-control,
nonproliferation, export-control, and other agreements to exploit new
technology while mitigating downside risk. These agreements should seek
to maintain global strategic stability among the major powers, and
prevent the proliferation of dangerous weapons systems to hostile and
revisionist states.

Contend With China's Risky R&D,\"

PLAYING WITH FIRE

Morally fraught experiments have flourished in China in recent years. In
2017, surgeons at Harbin Medical University defied international
condemnation to attempt the first human head transplant. In 2018, a
Shenzhen biophysicist implanted embryos edited through experiments that
risked introducing destructive mutations into the human gene pool. And
in 2019, China's Institute of Zoology invited a Spanish biochemist to
create human-monkey chimeras as organ transplant sources.

These boundary-pushing developments aren't just the work of a few bad
apples. [Rogue scientists are the predictable product of a national
system that reduces research oversight in Beijing to a "rubber
stamp,"]{.underline} according to recent testimony before the World
Health Organization by the Chinese medical ethicist Hu Qingli.
Indifference is part of the problem. The Chinese Ministry of Health, for
instance, ostensibly banned unauthorized stem cell therapies in 2012.
But a decade later, pop-up stem cell clinics still hawk untested
interventions to repair spinal cords and augment breasts. [Corruption is
another factor. Incidents of bribery at the China Food and Drug
Administration]{.underline}, now known as the National Medical Products
Administration, [led to mass casualties from at least six tainted drugs
meant to treat]{.underline} autoimmune disorders, erectile dysfunction,
and other [ailments.]{.underline}

[Then there is China's heavy-handed program of biometric surveillance
and population control]{.underline}. In 2018, Beijing used Islamic
terrorism as a pretext to launch the most technologically sophisticated
regime of data mining and collection that the world has ever seen[.
Drones with facial recognition cameras hover over regions such as
Xinjiang while police at checkpoints take mandatory iris scans, blood
samples, and genetic tests from Uyghur Muslims. Beijing exports this
digital security and mass surveillance architecture to dozens of other
countries]{.underline}, including Egypt and Uganda, where they have been
used to persecute sexual minorities and religious dissidents.

Even countries that use these tools to promote public health and safety
unwittingly supply China with their citizens' biometric information.
According to a Reuters investigation, Shenzhen-based BGI Genomics is
amassing and analyzing genetic data on women and fetuses from a
noninvasive prenatal test that the firm developed in conjunction with
the Chinese military. The kit is marketed in more than 50 countries,
including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, Pakistan, Spain,
Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Roughly 8.4 million women have used
it. One BGI study allegedly used a military supercomputer to "map the
prevalence of viruses in Chinese women, look for indicators of mental
illness in them, and single out Tibetan and Uyghur minorities to find
links between their genes and their characteristics."

China's top-down approach to biotechnology also has serious implications
for family planning. The country's now lapsed one-child policy was
supposed to bring economic prosperity. Instead, it yielded an epidemic
of forced sterilizations, abortions, and female infanticide that
produced the country's current lopsided sex ratio and aging workforce.
But that experience hasn't stopped Beijing from experimenting with new
forms of genetic control. A 1995 law aimed at "avoid\[ing\] new births
of inferior quality and heighten\[ing\] the standards of the whole
population" requires couples at risk of passing along infectious or
hereditary diseases to use long-term contraceptives or postpone marriage
until after child-bearing age.

In 2022, moreover, millions of Chinese parents will use state-subsidized
"talent tests" to screen offspring for traits such as height,
intelligence, memory, extroversion, musical ability, and athletic
prowess. These policies of biological selection and enhancement extend
beyond family planning. A 2016 Chinese government report, for instance,
underscored the potential value of gene editing to boost troops' combat
effectiveness. Former U.S. Director of National Intelligence John
Ratcliffe warned in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed that the Chinese
military is working to engineer "soldiers with biologically enhanced
capabilities"---from superstrength to altitude sickness resistance.

INNOVATE OR PERISH

[Chinese developments in biotechnology demand a U.S.
response]{.underline}. The last national bioethics commission lapsed in
2017, and Washington has yet to authorize a replacement. A newly
established commission should engage with universities and industries to
set norms and expectations around bioethics. [Good models for this kind
of public-private collaboration already exist.]{.underline}
Organizations such as the Secure DNA Project and the Morningside
Group---independent coalitions dedicated to safely and fairly governing
genetic synthesis and brain-computer interfaces, respectively---are
examples of what scientists, ethicists, and others can accomplish
together. [Future interdisciplinary teams can act as gatekeepers to
affirm moral standards and condemn transgressions]{.underline}---for
instance, by determining who gets published in high-impact journals and
invited to prestigious conferences.

[These partnerships can also help bridge ideological differences on
issues such as vaccine passports, gene-edited immunity, and challenge
trials that pay people to test new therapies for COVID-19.]{.underline}
These are debates that democratic societies are well equipped to handle.
Four of the world's biggest democracies---Australia, India, Japan, and
the United States---have recognized the existential stakes of life
sciences research and recently pledged to collectively tackle "the
critical and emerging technologies of the future, beginning with
biotechnology." That work should include establishing a global medical
ethics consortium built on international agreements such as the
Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, treaties such as
the Biological Weapons Convention, and multilateral arrangements such as
the T-12---a group of technologically advanced democracies.

Still, democratic societies can't maintain bioethical standards alone.
Going forward, [the United States and other democracies must engage with
authoritarian states, especially on areas of shared interest, including
biodiversity, climate change, and highly infectious
diseases.]{.underline} A natural starting point is oversight to ensure
that Beijing actually implements its Biosecurity Law of
2021---legislation designed to guide Beijing's policies on everything
from bioterrorism to biotechnology. Washington should also focus on
developing new treaty guidelines for human experimentation and
genetic-information sharing.

THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT

[China's DNA-based approach to picking its 2022 Olympic
competitors]{.underline} may look like a harbinger of a grim future. But
the country's athletic history also suggests a path for managing this
new form of geopolitical competition.

Between 1988 and 1998, [52 Chinese Olympic athletes tested positive for
banned performance-enhancing drugs]{.underline}, including a half dozen
gold medal winners. In response to the resulting international outcry,
the International Olympic Committee created the World Anti-Doping
Agency. Chastened, China developed the world's most rigorous anti-doping
measures---mandating education, exams, and pledges among athletes and
coaches. Violators got lifetime bans. The Chinese state also sought to
repair its reputation, funding new research and pledging long-term
commitments to international anti-doping efforts.

At the time, [verification and transparency made it possible to hold
China accountable for its ethics violations, and international pressure
and the threat of meaningful sanctions drove Beijing to act more
responsibl]{.underline}y---in sports, anyway. [Similar policies could
work today in the field of bioethics, helping rein in China's reckless
behavior.]{.underline} In this way, Beijing's revolutionary Olympic
selection process could be the opening the world needs to thrash out the
moral status of scientific advances just over the horizon.

#### By setting standards the US can get China to comply, the alternative is a world dominated by biotech used to enforce social Darwinism. 

**Cheng \'18** \[Yangyang, Apr 13, \"China Will Always Be Bad at
Bioethics,\"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/13/china-will-always-be-bad-at-bioethics/\]

This April, potential sperm donors at one of Beijing's top hospitals
found themselves facing a set of tough new standards. Listed as the
first criteria, before any mention of infectious or hereditary diseases,
was the requirement that potential donors have "a love for socialism and
the motherland" and be "supportive of the leadership of the party."

By itself, this would be just one more incident of political excess in a
country where full-blown Chinese Communist Party ideology is making a
fierce comeback. But unlike the demands that students dump "Western"
textbooks or that singers parrot their love for President Xi Jinping,
[China's bioethical standards are more than a curiosity for outsiders.
They may shape the future of humanity.]{.underline}

[Chinese scientists]{.underline}, in January, [produced the world's
first cloned primates through somatic cell nuclear
transfer]{.underline}, the same technique that created Dolly the sheep
in Scotland in 1996. In the summer of 2017, the gene-editing technology
CRISPR was successfully used for the first time to edit a gene
associated with a disease in human embryos by an international team of
scientists from the United States, China, and South Korea; that was just
two years after Chinese scientists shocked the world by making the first
such attempt. While the United States is just starting to look for the
first patient for such studies, at least eight clinical trials are
underway in China using CRISPR technology to treat cancer.

[As China's advances in biotechnology come closer to the secrets of
life, they pose tantalizing prospects for the future]{.underline}. But
[when standards for research on the latest technological frontiers are
being set by a government that has always prioritized power over ethics,
there's also plenty of cause for concern.]{.underline}

\*\*\*

It was not until 1998 that the Chinese Ministry of Health established an
ethics committee and issued the first set of guidelines on medical
ethics in China. Over the past two decades, China has made earnest
efforts toward the ethical practice of biomedicine. After years of
denial, the Chinese government acknowledged in 2006 its decades-long
practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners, and it has
progressed toward a registry with volunteer donors. Nevertheless, many
of the country's rules and regulations, as in other fields, exist more
on paper than in practice.

While the Chinese Communist Party has a branch office at every school
and every hospital, the presence of ethics boards is optional. According
to a presentation at the World Health Organization by one of China's
leading medical ethicists, Hu Qingli, only about half of Chinese
provinces had set up ethics committees by the early 2010s; the same went
for individual hospitals. Even when ethics boards exist, conflicts of
interest are rife. While the Ministry of Health's ethics guidelines
state that ethical reviews are "based upon the principles of ethics
accepted by the international community," they lack enforcement
mechanisms and provide few instructions for investigators. As a result,
the ethics review process is often reduced to a formality, "a rubber
stamp" in Hu's words. The lax ethical environment has led many to
consider China the "Wild East" in biomedical research. Widely criticized
and rejected by Western institutions, the Italian surgeon Sergio
Canavero found a home for his radical quest to perform the first human
head transplant in the northern Chinese city of Harbin. Canavero's
Chinese partner, Ren Xiaoping, although specifying that human trials
were a long way off, justified the controversial experiment on
technological grounds, "I am a scientist, not an ethical expert." As the
Chinese government props up the pseudoscience of traditional Chinese
medicine as a valid "Eastern" alternative to anatomy-based "Western"
medicine, the utterly unscientific approach makes the establishment of
biomedical regulations and their enforcement even more difficult.

[The fragile bioethics system in China is further weakened by rampant
corruption.]{.underline} In 2006, a [large-scale investigation into the
Chinese State Food and Drug Administration resulted in arrests and
imprisonment of several of its highest officials for allegedly accepting
bribes, including]{.underline} the administration's Director Zheng
Xiaoyu, who was ultimately executed. As with much of the anti-corruption
effort in China, the crackdown started after dozens died due to unsafe
drugs in highly publicized cases; the actual figures remain unknown.

And [in medicine]{.underline}, as with much else in China, [authorities
will often evade laws that exist on paper if there are
customers]{.underline} (or, in this case, patients) [willing to
pay]{.underline}. China long ago banned doctors from revealing the sex
of embryos to patients, but the practice remains common and contributes
to gender-based abortion. Another example is the clinical use of stem
cells. The Chinese Ministry of Health classified stem cell treatments as
"high risk" and banned its clinical usage without approval in 2009.
However, a Nature investigation in 2012 revealed that despite increased
regulatory clampdowns, stem cell clinics were still popping up across
the country, charging patients thousands of dollars for unauthorized
therapies.

\*\*\*

[The willingness to overlook safety for financial gain hints at a
greater challenge with bioethics in China]{.underline} --- **[not just
structural, but ideological]{.underline}**. [Authoritarian states
naturally prioritize the strength of their own power,]{.underline}
including the size of their economy, above all else; this runs contrary
to, and inevitably undermines, the healing purpose of medicine.

China's record attests to this. Claiming the "great rejuvenation of the
Chinese people" as its ultimate mission, the [Chinese government has
conducted massive social engineering campaigns to control and "improve"
its population]{.underline}. The one-child policy was carried out with
forced abortions, compulsory sterilization, and female infanticide,
leading to an aging population and severe gender imbalance. Faced with
the resulting demographic crisis, the Chinese government has now turned
to campaigns encouraging "the right quality" of women --- namely
younger, urban women with a college education --- to have more children,
while imposing constraints on reproduction for ethnic minorities and in
particular the Uighurs. The Maternal and Infant Health Care Law of 1995,
initially named the "Eugenics and Health Protection Law" with the
explicit purpose to "prevent new births of inferior quality,"
effectively mandated childlessness for people with genetic disorders,
certain infectious diseases, and mental illness.

[Communism bases much of its legitimacy on its claims of resting on a
foundation of science]{.underline} --- but its understanding of science
centers far more on authority than skepticism[. "Scientific" in China's
party editorials is virtually synonymous with "politically approved."
The party's journals are filled with glowing evaluations of Mao Zedong's
"scientific" legacy]{.underline}. The constitution's latest addition, Xi
Jinping Thought, lists early in its 14-point manifesto "adopting
science-based ideas" for development. The suggestion is that if a
government is "scientific," then the state's grasp on power must be as
absolute and above criticism as the laws of the universe --- even when
that power is used to persecute scientists and crush entire branches of
research considered contrary to political ideology, as the Chinese
government has repeatedly done.

[When science is used in service of legitimizing an authoritarian
system, the resulting research, however successful it might appear to
be, inevitably abandons cosmopolitan ideals]{.underline}. The first two
monkey clones born in a Chinese lab in January were named Zhong Zhong
and Hua Hua; zhonghua means the Chinese nation and its people. The
macaque twins were not just portrayed as the product of science, but of
Chinese science.

[This politicized approach to science also abets the trampling of
ethical boundaries]{.underline}. Communism emphasizes the idea of
"constant struggle," not only between classes, but also against nature.
China, like the Soviet Union before it, has already paid a harsh
environmental cost for this approach to development policy. During the
Great Leap Forward, sparrows were initially listed among the "four
pests" to be extinguished, and the drastic reduction in sparrow
population led to an increase in crop pests that worsened ongoing
famine.

[Most concerning of all is how the Chinese state's understanding of
science discounts the autonomy of an individual body for the collective
notion of a strong national body]{.underline}. [The legacy of social
Darwinism still permeates China, evident in the government's swift and
brutal campaign this past winter to rid the city of Beijing of its
migrant workers and their families]{.underline}, callously referred to
in official documents as the "low-end population."

But the justification of individual sacrifice for the greater good is
contrary to any principle-based bioethics framework. When Jesse
Gelsinger died at the University of Pennsylvania as the first casualty
of gene therapy in 1999, the tragedy halted this type of experimental
treatment on humans for several years in the United States, and it still
serves as a somber reminder for the medical community. Had the death
occurred in China, it would most likely have been either covered up or
turned into propaganda depicting Gelsinger as a national martyr.

[With the Chinese government's intensifying explicit push for
"civil-military fusion," one should also take it at its word and assume
any of its new technology will be dual-use --- with military uses
applying both to national defense and internal suppression]{.underline}.
The Chinese government is already collecting DNA samples among other
biometrics data in its far-west province of Xinjiang, where ethnic
minorities like the Uighurs are already subject to systematic
discrimination, and building up a massive surveillance state using
artificial intelligence.

The introduction of AI into health care in China, spearheaded by Chinese
tech giants including Tencent and Alibaba, can help with an overburdened
hospital system, but it also raises serious privacy concerns in a state
where data privacy is nonexistent. [Biotechnology will become a powerful
tool in the Chinese security state.]{.underline}

\*\*\*

In ninth-century China, Taoist alchemists searching for the elixir of
life found a dark mixture that was highly combustible. They named it
huoyao, "fire medicine." In the pursuit of immortality, the Chinese
invented gunpowder.

[In the face of China's advances in biotechnology today, the world must
be vigilant. At the same time, paranoia can]{.underline}, and should,
[be avoided; the correct approach is principled engagement, not
isolation]{.underline}. A [secure future demands that all stakeholders
come together in good faith to reach a collective agreement in the
development and utilization of biotechnology.]{.underline}

The International Summit on Human Gene Editing in 2015 --- co-hosted by
the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine in
the United States, the Royal Society in the United Kingdom, and the
Chinese Academy of Sciences --- and the National Academies of Science
and Medicine's 2017 report by 22 science and ethics experts from
multiple countries laying out guidelines for human genome editing are
both encouraging examples in the direction toward global governance and
shared responsibility.

[Biological threats recognize no human borders. Disparity in bioethics
anywhere weakens bioethics everywhere]{.underline}. [Liberal democracies
must take advantage of the openness of their system to educate the
public, live up to the highest ethical standards in protecting human
rights and safeguarding the environment, and make such standards the
bedrock of universal principles]{.underline}. [China is most likely to
abide by such standards when its membership in the global political and
scientific community depends on it]{.underline} --- in other words,
[when it has no other choice]{.underline}.

#### Biotech is the key test of international leadership.

BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANTAGE,\"
<https://warontherocks.com/2021/09/beyond-biological-defense-maintaining-the-u-s-biotechnology-advantage/>\]

China, by contrast, has been integrating biotechnology into its
strategic development and elevating biotechnology to a key component of
national security. China's military-civil fusion development strategy
makes biotechnology a core priority for the People's Liberation Army.
This strategy has one goal: to bring together China's civilian and
military industrial bases in order to better project power. To that end,
China has cornered supply chains in multiple sectors, including
pharmaceuticals ingredients and other important chemicals.

Stephanie Rogers, the Defense Department's acting principal director for
biotechnology, recently declared that "[the nation that leads the world
in biotechnology will accrue enduring economic, societal, and defense
gains." Unfortunately, this awareness has yet to be reflected in
government policy. Biotechnology security is national
security]{.underline} --- for the United States and for China. The
Department of Defense should recognize biotechnology's role as a
foundational technology and make biotechnology development and supply
chain security a priority.

Maintaining America's Biotechnology Advantage

[Biotechnology in the United States is a significant contributor to the
economy]{.underline}. By one estimate, in 2017, U.[S. biotechnology
revenues exceeded \$400 billion, or 2 **percent of gross domestic
product**]{.underline}, substantially surpassing better-measured sectors
such as mining[. Bioeconomy revenues have grown at an average rate of 10
percent annually for two decades]{.underline}. Notably, [U.S.
biotechnology revenues alone were approximately equal to worldwide
semiconductor revenues for 2017.]{.underline} Biotechnology now supplies
critical medicines, and, as more than 90 percent of the corn and soy
grown in the United States is genetically modified, biotechnology feeds
the armed forces. Industrial biotechnology is responsible for upward of
20 percent of chemicals produced in the United States, suggesting a
similar proportion of chemicals used in the military are also
biologically derived. And these impressive figures may still be
significant underestimates: Using a different methodology, [the U.S.
National Academy of Sciences recently concluded that the biotechnology
industry contributes 5 to 7 percent of U.S. gross domestic product.
Biotechnology]{.underline}, therefore, [may already constitute an even
larger share of the military supply chain.]{.underline}

As biotechnology continues to mature, its contribution to physical and
economic security will become even more significant. Tools are now being
deployed that enable the engineering and biomanufacturing of materials
that will eventually not only displace petrochemicals but also surpass
them in production scale and performance. Over the next ten to twenty
years, biological production could soon supply up to 60 percent of
physical inputs across the global economy, and biotechnology could have
a "direct economic impact of up to \$4 trillion a year."

[While the United States is arguably still leading in biotechnology, it
risks losing this lead to China]{.underline}. In [China, biotechnology
is a national development and a security matter. China's Innovation
Driven Development Strategy emphasizes biotechnology's essential role in
the country's economic development,]{.underline} while the
Military-Civil Fusion Development Strategy seeks to ensure that
biotechnology research is also oriented toward the country's military
and broader security goals. [Chinese biotechnology revenues are reported
to be of a similar size to those in the United States, although they are
subject to even lesser clarity in reporting.]{.underline}

While China continues its licit and illicit acquisition efforts
targeting the U.S. biotechnology sector, it is also shifting its
attention to domestic innovation. In time, [this will provide the
People's Liberation Army with new capabilities and increase both
America's and the Pentagon's reliance on Chinese biotechnology
products.]{.underline}

#### Who leads in the development and sale of technology will determine the future of the international order -- it's either democracy or autocracy, there is no in-between.

THE CLASH OF SYSTEMS

The history of international order building is one of savage competition
between clashing systems, not of harmonious cooperation. In the best of
times, that competition took the form of a cold war, [with each side
jockeying for advantage and probing each other with every measure short
of military force. In many cases, however, the competition eventually
boiled over into a shooting war and ended with one side crushing the
other]{.underline}. The victorious order then ruled until it was
destroyed by a new competitor---or until it simply crumbled without an
external threat to hold it together.

Today, a growing number of policymakers and pundits are calling for a
new concert of powers to sort out the world's problems and divide the
globe into spheres of influence. But the idea of an inclusive order in
which no one power's vision prevails is a fantasy that can exist only in
the imaginations of world-government idealists and academic theorists[.
There are only two orders under construction right now---a Chinese-led
one and a U.S.-led one---and the contest between the two is rapidly
becoming a clash between autocracy and democracy, as both countries
define themselves against each other and try to infuse their respective
coalitions with ideological purpose]{.underline}. [China is positioning
itself as the world's defender of hierarchy and tradition against a
decadent and disorderly West; the United States is belatedly summoning a
new alliance to check Chinese power]{.underline} and [make the world
safe for democracy]{.underline}.

[This clash of systems will define the twenty-first century and divide
the world]{.underline}. China will view the emerging democratic order as
a containment strategy designed to strangle its economy and topple its
regime. In response, it will seek to protect itself by asserting greater
military control over its vital sea-lanes, carving out exclusive
economic zones for its firms, and propping up autocratic allies as it
sows chaos in democracies. [The upsurge of Chinese repression and
aggression]{.underline}, in turn, [will further impel the United States
and its allies to shun Beijing and build a democratic
order]{.underline}. For a tiny glimpse of what this vicious cycle might
look like, consider what happened in March 2021, when Canada, the United
Kingdom, the United States, and the EU sanctioned four Chinese officials
for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The sanctions amounted to a slap on
the wrist, but Beijing interpreted them as an assault on its sovereignty
and unleashed a diplomatic tirade and a slew of economic sanctions. The
EU returned fire by freezing its proposed EU-China Comprehensive
Agreement on Investment.

In the coming years, [the trade and technology wars between China and
the United States that began during the Trump administration will rage
on]{.underline} as both sides try to expand their respective spheres.
[Other countries will find it increasingly difficult to hedge their bets
by maintaining links to both blocs]{.underline}. Instead, [China and the
United States will push their partners to pick sides]{.underline},
[compelling them to reroute their supply chains and adopt wholesale the
ecosystem of technologies and standards of one side's
order]{.underline}. [The Internet will be split in two]{.underline}.
When people journey from one order to the other---if they can even get a
visa---they will enter a different digital realm. Their phones won't
work, nor will their favorite websites, their email accounts, or their
precious social media apps. [Political warfare between the two systems
will intensify, as each tries to undermine the domestic legitimacy and
international appeal of its competitor.]{.underline} East Asian
sea-lanes will grow clogged with warships, and rival forces will
experience frequent close encounters.

The standoff will end only when one side defeats or exhausts the other.
As of now, [the smart money is on the U.S. side, which has far more
wealth and military assets than China does and better prospects for
future growth]{.underline}. [By the early 2030s, Xi, an obese smoker
with a stressful job, will be in his 80s, if he is still
alive.]{.underline} China's demographic crisis will be kicking into high
gear, with the country projected to lose roughly 70 million working-age
adults and gain 130 million senior citizens between now and then.
Hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas Chinese loans will be due,
and many of China's foreign partners won't be able to pay them back. It
is hard to see how a country facing so many challenges could long
sustain its own international order, especially in the face of
determined opposition from the world's wealthiest countries.

[Yet it is also far from guaranteed that the U.S.-led democratic order
will hold together.]{.underline} The United States could suffer a
constitutional crisis in the 2024 presidential election and collapse
into civil strife. Even if that doesn't happen, the United States and
its allies might be rent by their own divides. The democratic world is
suffering its greatest crisis of confidence and unity since the 1930s.
Nationalism, populism, and opposition to globalism are rising, making
collective action difficult. The East Asian democracies have ongoing
territorial disputes with one another. [Many Europeans view China as
more of an economic opportunity than a strategic threat and seriously
**doubt the United States' reliability as an ally**,]{.underline} having
endured four years of tariffs and scorn from President Donald Trump, who
could soon be back in power. Europeans also hold different views from
Americans on data security and privacy, and European governments fear
U.S. technology dominance almost as much as they do Chinese digital
hegemony. India may not be ready to abandon its traditional policy of
nonalignment and back a democratic order, especially when it is becoming
more repressive at home, and an order built around democracy will
struggle to form productive partnerships with autocracies that would be
important partners in any alliance against China, such as Singapore and
Vietnam. Fear of China is a powerful force, but it might not be potent
enough to paper over the many cracks that exist within the emerging
anti-Chinese coalition.

[If that coalition fails to solidify its international order, then the
world will steadily slide back into anarchy, a struggle among rogue
powers and regional blocs in which the strong do what they can and the
weak suffer what they must. Some scholars assum]{.underline}e---or
hope---that an unordered world will sort itself out on its own, that
great powers will carve out stable spheres of influence and avoid
conflict or that the spread of international commerce and enlightened
ideas will naturally maintain global peace and prosperity. But peace and
prosperity are unnatural. When achieved, they are the result of
sustained cooperation among great powers---that is, of an international
order.

DOUBLING DOWN ON DEMOCRACY

[History shows that eras of fluid multipolarity typically end in
disaster,]{.underline} regardless of the bright ideas or advanced
technologies circulating at the time. [The late eighteenth century
witnessed the pinnacle of the Enlightenment]{.underline} in Europe,
before the continent [descended into the **hell of the Napoleonic
Wars**]{.underline}. At the start of the twentieth century, the world's
sharpest minds predicted an end to great-power conflict as railways,
telegraph cables, and steamships linked countries closer together. The
worst war in history up to that point quickly followed. [The sad and
paradoxical reality is that international orders are vital to avert
chaos]{.underline}, yet they typically emerge only during periods of
great-power rivalry. [Competing with China will be fraught with risk for
the United States and its allies, but it might be the only way to avoid
even greater dangers.]{.underline}

[To build a better future, the United States and its allies will need to
take a more enlightened view of their interests]{.underline} than they
did even during the Cold War. Back then, [their economic interests
dovetailed nicely with their geopolitical interests**. Simple
greed,**]{.underline} if nothing else, [could compel capitalist states
to band together to protect private property against **a communist
onslaught**]{.underline}. Now, however, the choice is not so simple,
because standing up to China will entail significant economic costs,
especially in the short term. Those costs might pale in comparison to
the long-term costs of business as usual with Beijing---Chinese
espionage has been estimated to deprive the United States alone of
somewhere between \$200 billion and \$600 billion annually---to say
nothing of the moral quandaries and geopolitical risks of cooperating
with a brutal totalitarian regime with revanchist ambitions. Yet the
ability to make such an enlightened calculation in favor of confronting
China may be beyond the capacities of any nation, especially ones as
polarized as the United States and many of its democratic allies.

#### Restraint will fail -- the US needs to wield its power for good. 

**Brands \'22** - The Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies \[Hal,
Jun1, \"The World Doesn't Need a More Restrained
America,\"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-world-doesnt-need-a-more-restrained-america/\]

It has been a bumpy year for the restraint coalition --- that loose
network of analysts, advocates and politicians calling for a sharply
reduced US role in the world. Having reached peak influence with the
withdrawal from Afghanistan, this group initially found itself
marginalized by Russia's war in Ukraine. Now, the restraint crowd is
offering a renewed critique of US policy, one that will probably prove
to be persistent, though not persuasive.

Restraint is a broad church. It features anti-interventionist academics,
who often style themselves as non-ideological "realists," alongside
well-funded think tanks such as the Quincy Institute. It includes
libertarians such as Senator Rand Paul who deplore the financial costs
of US foreign policy and progressives who contend that American
globalism is a cover for imperialism and neoliberalism. There are
pacifists who believe that all wars are criminal, as well as
nationalists such as Senator Josh Hawley who argue that being
appropriately hawkish on China requires being more dovish on nearly
everything else.

[Some restrainers seek wholesale global retrenchment; others mainly
decry ongoing US involvement]{.underline} in Europe and the Middle East.
[What unites them is a conviction that the overuse of US power has been
catastrophic for America and the world]{.underline}.

This coalition seemed ascendant a year ago, when President Joe Biden
denounced the "forever wars" while pulling out of Afghanistan. That
decision, two analysts argued, marked Biden as a hard-nosed realist ---
and perhaps an ally in the struggle to reshape American diplomacy.

Yet the moment didn't last. [The collapse of the Afghan state even
before the US finished withdrawing showed that, while waging wars is
expensive, losing them can impose a serious cost. Then came Russia's
assault on Ukraine]{.underline}. As Vladimir [Putin's forces sought to
restore the Soviet empire and murdered Ukrainian citizens]{.underline},
they revealed just how awful a world shaped by great powers other than
Washington might be.

Indeed, Biden isn't getting much praise from self-proclaimed realists
today. While refusing to intervene militarily, Biden has otherwise
backed Ukraine with money, weapons and other support. NATO --- whose
peaceful expansion allegedly forced Putin to order a campaign of
aggression and murder --- now appears likely to add two new members,
Finland and Sweden. [Biden has even invoked the rhetorical legacy of his
cold war predecessors, declaring that Ukraine is a vital front in the
struggle to save the free world]{.underline}.

In response, [the restraint coalition has itself opened a new front,
finding multiple reasons to attack Biden's Ukraine policy]{.underline}.

First is cost. [Sustaining a medium-sized country under a ferocious
military assault is fantastically expensive]{.underline}. The latest US
support package for Ukraine totals some \$40 billion --- money, Hawley
complained, that could be better spent on giving US military personnel a
generous raise. Some Republicans in Congress seem to agree --- 57
representatives and 11 senators voted, unsuccessfully, against the aid
package.

Second is risk. [No one knows how the war in Ukraine will end. If the US
helps Ukraine defend itself too successfully]{.underline}, the thinking
goes[, then perhaps a humiliated Russia will escalate wildly rather than
accept defeat.]{.underline}

Finally, there is politics. With Biden having gone all-in on Ukraine,
there's little space for the restraint contingent on the left. But
Hawley and other Republicans seeking to inherit Donald Trump's political
base clearly believe that there is a constituency for claims that
supporting a vulnerable democracy equates to putting "America last."

It is uncharitable to label such arguments "pro-Putin." Forty billion
dollars is real money, given that the Pentagon is struggling to find a
10th of that for urgent near-term improvements to America's military
posture in the Pacific. There is, undoubtedly, danger in a scenario
where Putin worries that he is losing the war --- and in consequence
loses his head.

[But the perpetual problem with restraint is the corresponding
unwillingness to consider what happens after America pulls
back]{.underline}. [Suppose Washington does slash support to Ukraine and
leave European security to the Europeans. What does that
bring]{.underline}?

Judging by the past century --- or even the past six months --- [the
answer is not a stable Europe and a more solvent America.]{.underline}
Rather, [the result is likely to be a partially successful Russian war
of conquest that creates pervasive insecurity in Europe]{.underline}; a
continent that, [lacking American leadership, is less united and
confident in opposing Putin; and greater global instability that
ultimately makes it harder to contain China]{.underline}, as well.

[Similarly in the Middle East, reasonable people can debate the proper
level of U.S. involvement,]{.underline} or what constitutes a reasonable
risk to accept on a variety of issues, from containing Iran to opposing
Putin's ambitions in Ukraine. But [recent events have reminded us that a
world less influenced by the US will be one in which autocratic
predation becomes more common]{.underline}. The Ukraine [war has
reminded the world about the stubborn persistence of evil.]{.underline}
In doing so, [it has also illuminated the virtues of American
power]{.underline}.

\*EDT: emerging and disruptive technologies

[The third driver is to foster the interoperability of military
capabilities that are enabled by emerging technologies]{.underline}13
[and to incentivize transatlantic defense cooperation on EDTs to avoid
or bridge technology gaps between allies]{.underline}. This goes to the
core of NATO's mission to deter and defend against threats, but it is an
enduring challenge. [Streamlining standardization and testing,
evaluation, verification, and validation procedures remains
important]{.underline}. However, [NATO should also double down on its
efforts to ensure greater compliance with interoperability and baseline
requirements for the security of critical infrastructure]{.underline}.
Recent challenges in relation to national compliance with the 2019 NATO
requirements for security of telecommunications infrastructure are a
case in point, but there are wider and enduring challenges with hardware
and communications interoperability.14 While the plans for the new
Defence Innovation Accelerator promise to contribute to maintaining
NATO's technological edge, [it also remains to be seen whether they will
contribute sufficiently to building technology capacity among some of
the smaller and more vulnerable allies]{.underline}. As they establish
governance procedures and participation rules, allies need to mitigate
the risk that the accelerator could contribute to a two-speed, two-tier
alliance, dividing the technology haves from the technology have-nots.

[The fourth driver is a desire to lead in setting global, normative EDTs
governance]{.underline}. [The Advisory Group on Emerging and Disruptive
Technologies]{.underline}, for example, [has emphasized that **NATO "is
exceptionally well placed to be a global driver of a values-based
innovation agenda**]{.underline}."15 [Democratic values are at the core
of what defines security for transatlantic allies and the target of
adversarial subversive measures]{.underline}. Consequently, embedding
democratic values into the development, adoption, and use of EDTs by the
allies is key to NATO's mission. Thus, [innovation efforts need to be
closer linked to NATO's democracy-centered tech diplomacy]{.underline}
with like-minded global partners, some of whom could be invited to join
the Defence Innovation Accelerator.

[The fifth driver is organizational and procedural change, notably to
build "a resilient innovation pipeline for the alliance"16 and a
sustainable innovation ecosystem]{.underline}. This is a more
challenging undertaking than it may first appear. [Military
organizations have **historically innovated more coherently and
efficiently** than other public organizations.]{.underline}17 However,
in the case of EDTs, this pattern is challenged[. NATO and allied
military organizations are not driving technological progress, are not
the main agents of innovation, and depend on effective civilian-military
collaboration for their own innovation efforts]{.underline}.

#### The US is key to NATO interoperability and unlocking the potential of smaller countries.

Pursuing Collaborative Innovation

[Not all allies have the defense funding, technological capacity,
skills, and military infrastructure to facilitate rapid defense
innovation, including the adoption and scaling of emerging
technologies]{.underline}. And [not all that have such resources and
knowledge are willing to share them in collaborative innovation
processes. Leading allies]{.underline}---[the United
States]{.underline}, France, the United Kingdom, and the
Netherlands---[already have national-focused approaches to the adoption
of EDTs]{.underline}. By contrast, [for most Central and Eastern
countries EDTs in defense are mainly a long-term prospect. Previous
challenges in]{.underline} integrating cyber capabilities into [NATO
operations, persistent capability gaps among the allies, and slow
standardization procedures are a good indication of the magnitude of the
challeng]{.underline}e, which is acknowledged at the highest levels of
NATO decision-making.

As Secretary-General Stoltenberg has stated[, a technological gap
between the allies would undermine interoperability and weaken alliance
cohesion]{.underline}. In [the context of the NATO AI and big data
strategies and the Defense Innovation Accelerator, allies should reflect
on how to improve and facilitate technological transfers among
themselves]{.underline}. This [could enable smaller allies to specialize
in niche EDTs capabilities]{.underline}, as has been the case with
cyber, for example, and could prevent the emergence of new technological
and capability gaps between the allies[. The Biden
administration's]{.underline} focus on shared democratic values and the
digital agenda, and [its willingness to strengthen NATO and technology
partnerships, constitute a window of opportunity for the alliance. It
should be fully capitalized on to accelerate transatlantic collaborative
defense innovation]{.underline}.

#### And, NATO is key to an accountable and strong response to emerging tech. 

**Jankowski \'21** -- Political Adviser and Head of the Political
Section at the Permanent Delegation of the Republic of Poland to NATO
\[Dominik, \" NATO and the Emerging and Disruptive Technologies
Challenge" in *NATO in the Era of Unpeace: Defending Against Known
Unknowns,* pp 99-102\]

While the suggestion that EDTs will enable a new class of weapons that
will modify the strategic landscape remains to be realised, a number of
unresolved security puzzles underlying the emergence of these new
technology areas have implications for NATO. As one looks to the future,
new adversaries and new science and technology will emerge. [The extent
to which these EDTs may exacerbate or mitigate the global security and
governance challenges that Russia currently poses to NATO Allies will
remain an integral question as policy-makers navigate the complex global
environment.]{.underline}

[NATO is a natural forum for deliberations about EDTs,]{.underline}
especially in a transatlantic context[. It also has vast
experience]{.underline}, going back to the Cold War, [in working towards
standardisation and interoperability among Allies]{.underline}. However,
the results achieved have been mixed, which underscores the challenges
the Alliance now faces -- there are not only 30 Allies with disparate
levels of capability, but also a backdrop of rapid technological
advances where some of its competitors and adversaries may hold
significant advantages.

In this context, [NATO should concentrate on four core issues with
regard to EDTs]{.underline}. First, as Andrea Gilli [emphasizes, the
Alliance should start a process on "NATO-mation."]{.underline}29 In
fact, [the Alliance should serve as a primary transatlantic coordinating
institution for information-sharing and cooperation between Allies on
the security dimension of EDTs]{.underline}. [NATO has an important role
to play in the development of a common strategy based on an
Alliance-wide EDTs threat assessment and an analysis of
opportunities]{.underline}. Therefore, [EDTs can serve as a unifying
element for NATO's work on future policies.]{.underline}

Second, [NATO will need partners on its path towards achieving a
comprehensive implementation strategy on EDTs]{.underline}. This will
require connection with the private sector early and often, clearly
communicating [NATO's priorities and requirements while providing
accessible opportunities for industry, including non-traditional
ones]{.underline}. Much of the innovative work being undertaken in the
commercial sector is being carried out by companies that have never
worked in the defence realm or have no wish to do so. Therefore,
[building new partnerships at NATO with the private sector will enable
the Alliance to increase awareness, share data, and creatively tap into
experiences and knowledge]{.underline}. Moreover, [NATO and the EU
should initiate a strategic dialogue to address fundamental issues of
tech governance and data sharing in order to overcome the transatlantic
tech policy divide]{.underline}.

Third, Allies should manage expectations and not overestimate the role
of EDTs. EDTs are not a panacea to all of NATO's problems, including the
existing gaps in the still-needed conventional capabilities. Indeed,
EDTs will not be a silver bullet to address NATO's shortfalls.
Therefore, [Allies should first and foremost concentrate on two
elements: overcoming the interoperability gap30 and revitalizing NATO's
once robust standardization programme.31]{.underline}

Fourth, [Allies should consider using NATO as a body to coordinate
efforts to find innovative ways to finance EDTs, including through an
establishment of a NATO venture capital fund. A potential deep-tech
investment in technologies with security and defence applications
through a dedicated NATO structure could help Allies maintain their
technological edge]{.underline}.

Michael A, Jeffrey A Bluestone, and Wendell A Lim, \"Cell-Based
Therapeutics: The Next Pillar of Medicine,\" Science Translational
Medicine 03 Apr 2013: Vol. 5, Issue 179, pp. 179ps7

Today, [biomedical science sits on the cusp of **another revolution**:
the use of **human and microbial cells** as therapeutic
entities]{.underline} (1). In principle, [cells have therapeutic
capabilities that are distinct from those of small molecules and
biologics and that extend beyond the regenerative-medicine
arena]{.underline}. **[Part drug]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[part device]{.underline}**, [cells can sense diverse signals, move to
specific sites in the body, integrate inputs to make decisions, and
execute complex response behaviors]{.underline}---**[all in the context
of a specific tissue environment]{.underline}**. [These attributes
could]{.underline} potentially [be harnessed to treat **infections**,
**autoimmunity**, **cancers**, **metabolic diseases**, and **tissue
degeneration**]{.underline} as well as **[realizing tissue repair and
regeneration]{.underline}**. Indeed, pioneering clinical trials have
highlighted the benefits of using cells as therapeutic agents (2--7).
However, the complexity of cells and the challenge of controlling their
actions in a therapeutic setting provide daunting scientific,
regulatory, economic, and cultural obstacles to the establishment of
cells as a widespread and viable pharmaceutical platform.

With our deep mechanistic understanding of cellular systems biology,
[researchers are poised to harness these intricate behaviors in new ways
to generate an array of precisely regulated weapons against a **broad
range of diseases**]{.underline}. However, a critical step that will
enable the emergence of cells as the next therapeutic pillar is the
development of cellular engineering as a foundational science. This will
include mechanisms for editing and recoding genomes, the assembly of a
toolkit of molecular parts and regulatory modules that behave
predictably, and a systems-based theoretical framework that can provide
strategies for tuning and optimizing cellular behaviors.

HOW WHOLE CELLS TRUMP THEIR PARTS

If small molecules and biologics are tools, then cells are
carpenters---and architects and engineers as well. Of the three pillars,
only cells sense their surroundings, make decisions, and exhibit varied
and regulable behaviors (Table 1). Devices share some of these
advantages; indeed, some abiotic therapeutic nanodevices mimic cellular
behaviors, although these equally fascinating new therapeutic candidates
will not be discussed here.

Cells naturally perform therapeutic tasks

The human body has three kinds of natural agents that perform the tasks
we demand of therapeutics. The first two are small molecules (for
example, neurotransmitters) and biologics (such as antibodies, growth
factors, cytokines, and peptide hormones). Cells are the third---and the
only ones that can perform complex biological functions. For example,
macrophages engulf pathogens and recruit adaptive immune cells;
hematopoietic stem cells give rise to myeloid and lymphoid lineages;
chondrocytes produce a cartilaginous extracellular matrix; pancreatic β
cells sense glucose and respond by producing insulin; and gut bacteria
convert indigestible fibers into short-chain fatty acids that fuel
intestinal epithelial cells.

Cell behavior is exquisitely selective

Most small molecules and biologics are always active; they do not have
ON or OFF switches, and if they reach their target, they will bind it
and exert a biological effect. In contrast, cells sense their
environment and respond with an action only when in the presence of a
specific array of molecular inputs. Thus, cells can have exquisite
sensitivity and specificity, which impart a greater ability to limit
off-target action. Engineering and controlling key cellular receptors
and how their signals are processed could, in principle, allow
customization of responses such that only therapeutically relevant
signals trigger activation of a selected cellular behavior (8).

Cells are special delivery agents

PK and PD properties and metabolism determine where in the body small
molecules and biologics distribute. The inability to limit their
distribution to a single tissue or cell type often results in off-target
effects, which can be serious enough to end a drug-development program,
even at a costly late stage. For example, the insulin sensitization
activity of rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
(PPAR)--γ ligand, results from its activity in adipocytes, but the
increased risk of myocardial infarction observed in some patients arises
from the drug's action in cardiac cells. Although rare, this outcome has
had a chilling effect on drug sales and on the development of other
PPAR-γ--targeted drugs. Cells are less likely to have off-target effects
because they can selectively recognize and actively migrate toward
specific signals and exert their effects in a highly targeted manner.
One can imagine an ideal cellular agent that is engineered to produce a
PPAR-γ ligand, but only in the local environment of adipocytes.

[Cells can handle human genetic variability]{.underline}

Determining the right dose of a drug for a diverse patient population
can be challenging. Common polymorphisms in genes that encode drug
transporters or drug-metabolizing cytochromes P450 can tweak the
transport of a small molecule in and out of cells or alter drug
metabolism, respectively; as a result, the same dose of a small molecule
can, in different individuals, result in widely varying amounts of the
active metabolite reaching its target. For example, common polymorphisms
in the gene that encodes organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) lead to
reduced uptake of the type 2 diabetes drug metformin, resulting in
differences in the efficacy of metformin among individuals (9). In
contrast, cells could potentially be engineered to automatically adjust
to differences in host metabolism and transport by harboring a
rheostat-like circuit that produces more of a molecule when needed and
degrades the excess when a threshold concentration is exceeded. Thus, in
principle, [cells could yield therapeutic responses that are **less
variable** in different individuals]{.underline}.

Cell behaviors can be engineered

[To manage their disease, patients with]{.underline} autoimmune ([type
1]{.underline}) [diabetes]{.underline} (T1D) [have to monitor their
blood sugar, inject insulin, and limit their diets]{.underline}. Failure
to control T1D can have grave consequences, including blindness, limb
amputation, and death. Because T1D results from the autoimmune
destruction of insulin-synthesizing pancreatic β cells, [simply
replacing these cells is not a viable therapeutic strategy]{.underline}.
Instead, [introducing a cell that has been engineered to perform an
unnatural yet important task---]{.underline}for example, a T lymphocyte
that has been modified to sense glucose and produce insulin---[is a
provocative alternative]{.underline}. [Such a cell is]{.underline}
potentially [within]{.underline} the [reach]{.underline} of synthetic
biology [and,]{.underline} if it relieved the insulin dependency of T1D
patients[, would represent a major therapeutic
breakthrough]{.underline}. For the subset of T1D cases characterized by
the presence of autoantibodies that recognize and destroy insulin, this
cell might be engineered to produce an insulin derivative that
recognizes and modulates the activity of insulin receptors but evades
binding by insulin autoantibodies.

KILLER APPS FOR CELL THERAPY

Although small molecules and biologics will always have important
therapeutic niches, there are applications for which cells are better
equipped. [This section explores critical unmet needs in human disease
that **cell-based therapeutics** are uniquely well suited to
address]{.underline} (Fig. 1). We focus on three specific cases,
although there are arrays of other promising applications that are not
discussed here, including stem cell and dendritic-cell therapeutics,
which have been the subjects of numerous reviews (10--13). Two of these
cases are built on recent pioneering examples of cell-based therapies
that have demonstrated clinical efficacy: chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR)--modified T cells and fecal transplantations.

Immune cells that seek and destroy cancer

[The **most effective new small-molecule**]{.underline} (kinase
inhibitors) [and biologic]{.underline} (antibody) [cancer therapies
offer as little as 6 to 36 months of disease-free survival before
**cancer progression**]{.underline} (14, 15). Therefore, [one of the
major challenges for cancer therapy is to block the growth of
drug-tolerant or resistant cancer cells that underlie progression and to
kill metastatic cells that have broken free of the primary tumor mass
and intravasated into a blood or lymphatic vessel]{.underline}.

Combination therapies that prevent the outgrowth of resistant cells are
one possible therapeutic avenue, but small molecules and biologics have
a difficult time being sentinels. They cannot turn themselves on and
off, and so they rely entirely on specific molecular recognition to
determine whether or not they act. And because the target cell can
evolve resistance mechanisms (14), [the therapeutically useful lifetime
of a small molecule or biologic is limited]{.underline}.

[The job of detecting and destroying a shape-shifting cellular target
may be better suited to a **cell-based therapeutic**]{.underline}.
[Recent clinical studies have shown the efficacy of using engineered T
lymphocytes in treating chronic lymphoid leukemia]{.underline} (3, 4).
The ex vivo-transformed T cells were modified to express a CAR in which
the receptor extra-cellular targeting domain has been replaced by an
single-chain antibody that recognizes a tumor-specific molecule. These
and related studies: (7) (i) prove that it is possible to retarget
immune cells to detect and respond to new, non-natural signals and (ii)
establish T cells as a favorable chassis for engineering. Future
versions of CAR-modified T cells may encode control circuits that enable
them to be activated or deactivated in a small-molecule--dependent
fashion and to produce a biologic that counteracts adverse side effects,
such as cytokine storm (for example, an anti--IL-6 antibody).

Establishment of **[drug resistance]{.underline}** [is less likely to be
a problem for a sentinel cell therapeutic than for small molecules and
biologics]{.underline}. [A therapeutic cell could be engineered to
recognize multiple features of a target cell so that changing any one of
them would not be enough to evade detection]{.underline} (in effect, a
combination therapy). Given the ability of a cell-based therapeutic to
adapt to an evolving pathogen, [cells may be a natural choice for other
surveillance jobs as well, including seeking and destroying activated
cells from chronic infections, such as a latent]{.underline}
Mycobacterium [**tuberculosis** population]{.underline}.

#### Extinction

Issue: Bioterrorism Research September 2012 Pages 584-587

Existential threats to humanity

[In considering the importance of biological warfare]{.underline} as a
subject for concern [it is worthwhile to review the known existential
threats. At this time this writer can identify a]{.underline}t three
[major existential threats to humanity]{.underline}: (i) large-scale
thermonuclear war followed by a nuclear winter, (ii) a planet killing
asteroid impact and (iii) **[infectious disease]{.underline}**. To this
trio might be added climate change making the planet uninhabitable. Of
the three existential threats the first is deduced from the inferred
cataclysmic effects of nuclear war. For the second there is geological
evidence for the association of asteroid impacts with massive extinction
(Alvarez, 1987). As to an existential threat from microbes [**recent
decades have provided unequivocal evidence for the ability of certain
pathogens to cause the extinction of entire species**. Although
infectious disease has traditionally not been associated with extinction
this view]{.underline} has [changed by the finding that a single chytrid
fungus was responsible for the extinction of numerous amphibian
species]{.underline} (Daszak et al., 1999; Mendelson et al., 2006).
[**Previously**, the view that infectious diseases were not a cause of
extinction was predicated on the notion that many pathogens required
their hosts and that some proportion of the host population was
naturally resistant]{.underline}. However, **[that calculation does not
apply to microbes that are acquired directly from the environment and
have no need for a host]{.underline}**, such as the majority of fungal
pathogens. For those types of host--microbe interactions [**it is
possible for the pathogen to kill off every last member of a species
without harm to itself**, since it would return to its natural habitat
upon killing its last host]{.underline}. Hence, from the viewpoint of
existential threats [environmental microbes could potentially **pose a
much greater threat to humanity than**]{.underline} the **[known
pathogenic microbes]{.underline}**, which number somewhere near 1500
species (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2001), [especially if
some of these species acquired the capacity for pathogenicity as a
consequence of natural evolution]{.underline} or bioengineering.

International Institutions

[Only the weaponization of biotechnology is prohibited under
international law]{.underline}.145 Some international institutions have
demonstrated interest in considering broader implications of
biotechnologies. For example, since 1983, ASEAN has maintained a
subcommittee on biotechnology that facilitates coordination of regional
biotechnology projects. Similarly, since 1993, the OECD has maintained
an Internal Co-ordination Group for Biotechnology that monitors
developments in biotechnology and facilitates coordination among various
sectors involved in biotechnology research (e.g., agriculture, science
and technology, environment, industry). In addition, the United Nations
Convention on Biological Diversity is charged with governing the
development and use of genetically modified organisms.146 [These
entities are not,]{.underline} however, [focused specifically on
military applications of biotechnology]{.underline}. [In terms of
potential militarization, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention
requires review conferences,]{.underline} which every five years assess
both the implementation of the treaty and ongoing developments in
biotechnology. Annual meetings are held between review conferences to
informally consider relevant topics, as well as to address national
bilateral and multilateral efforts to enhance biosecurity. [Some
analysts have argued that an international framework should be
established to consider the militarization of biotechnologies and
discuss potential regulation of or limits on certain
applications]{.underline}.147

### AT: No Bioterror Threat

#### Scientific consensus proves bioweapons are a threat. 

**Cummings \'21** \[Christopher L., Kaitlin M. Volk, Anna A. Ulanova, Do
Thuy Uyen Ha Lam & Pei Rou Ng, "Emerging Biosecurity Threats and
Responses: A Review of Published and Gray Literature" in *Emerging
Threats of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology*, pp 13--36\]

[Bioweapons were the second most frequently mentioned threat, appearing
in 28% of the articles analyzed.]{.underline} Franconi et al. (2018)
define bioweapons as "deadly pathogens -- bacteria or viruses -- or
toxins that can be deliberately released in order to cause harm to
people or animals and plants." Generally, [when a bioweapon is used by a
state sponsored entity it is considered an act of biowarfare, while the
use of a bioweapon by a non-state sponsored entity or individual is
considered an act of bioterrorism]{.underline} (Jamil 2015), the latter
of which was mentioned in 17% of articles. Unaltered organisms can and
have been used as bioweapons in the past, such as in the 2001 anthrax
attacks. [Biotechnology opens the door to creating enhanced or novel
pathogens and new avenues for toxin production]{.underline}. Cross
(2018) identifies three ways in which biotechnology can be used to
create bioweapons: (1) "recreating pathogenic viruses such as Ebola,
SARS, or smallpox," (2) "engineering bacteria to make them more
dangerous, which could be easily accomplished by inserting genes to
confer antibiotic resistance," and (3) "engineering microbes to produce
and release toxic biochemicals." Researchers have already demonstrated
capabilities in all three of these avenues. Horsepox, a close relative
of smallpox, has been synthesized from mail-ordered DNA (Noyce et al.
2018), avian influenza has been engineered to allow for airborne
transmission between mammals (Linster et al. 2014), and botulinum toxin
has been produced using yeast cells (Fonfria et al. 2018). These three
cases are also prime examples of dual use research, as they were carried
out for beneficial purposes (vaccine development, study of transmission,
and enhanced therapeutics, respectively) but also provide a clear avenue
towards weaponization.

[Bioweapons and bioterrorism are mainly concerned with the deliberate
release of an engineered pathogen or toxin with the purpose of causing
harm,]{.underline} but the literature also identified accidental
releases of modified organisms as a threat. Accidental releases are
often cited as a concern for biosafety and not biosecurity. Pastorino et
al. (2017) delineates the two terms in a laboratory setting as follows:

"Laboratory biosafety" is the term used to describe the containment
principles, technologies, and practices that are implemented to prevent
unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins or their accidental
release. "Laboratory biosecurity" refers to institutional and personal
security measures designed to prevent the loss, theft, misuse,
diversion, or intentional release of pathogens and toxins."

### AT: Too Many Barriers

#### Elementary school students could build a bioweapon.

\[Benjamin D, Marie-Valentie Florin, Edward Perkins, and Igor Linkov,\"
Biosecurity for Synthetic Biology and Emerging Biotechnologies: Critical
Challenges for Governance" in *Emerging Threats of Synthetic Biology and
Biotechnology*\]

Because emerging biotechnologies are dual-use, governance must weigh the
risk of misuse with the potential for beneficial use in innovation and
development. Unfortunately[, biosecurity attempts are mired in
uncertainty around both the actual capabilities of synthetic biology, as
well as the motivations of actors given the increasing number of
contexts in which synthetic biology is used]{.underline}. [Modern
governments are still relying on old rules to regulate a new technology,
clearly an insufficient strategy for ensuring security in the coming
decades]{.underline}.

Building an effective biosecurity strategy to encompass twenty-first
century biotechnologies requires understanding the novelties that
sciences like synthetic biology create in the biosecurity threat space,
as well as the structural vulnerabilities these sciences can exploit and
the likely causes of inadequate biosecurity practices. Synthetic
biology's novel biosecurity concerns arise from its broad scope, wider
availability, complexity, and uncertainty over current and future
capabilities. For example, critical developments such as gene editing
via CRISPR gene editing vastly improve upon previous genetic engineering
processes and may yield a revolution in human and environmental health
research, but may also cause substantial and irreversible harms. One
application of gene editing is the gene drive, which can rapidly
propagate a certain set of genes or alleles through a population,
circumventing Mendelian inheritance laws and increasing the chance that
this set of genes is passed on. While gene drives are an exciting new
technology, their ability to rapidly alter the genetic makeup of a
population is cause for concern. Other potential negative consequences
of gene editing may include the unconstrained diffusion of gene-edited
material throughout the environment, the disruption of ecologies with
genetically-modified organisms (in particular engineered gene drive
systems), and off-target impacts from genome editing. These techniques
could also be used maliciously, with an actor purposely targeting humans
and/or the environment.

[The publication and dissemination of a methodology for synthesizing
horsepox in a laboratory setting was a recent application of gene
editing]{.underline} (Noyce et al. 2018[). Some critics say this
information could support a nefarious actor to reconstitute and develop
smallpox, or to synthetize other viruses.]{.underline} Additionally,
[the widely publicized recreation of the 1918 Spanish
Influenza]{.underline} (Tumpey et al. 2005), which killed some 50
million people worldwide at the close of the First World War, [could
facilitate the synthesis process for actors wishing to cause
harm]{.underline}. Even nonpathogenic approaches have been described as
dual-use research, ranging from the disruption of local ecologies via
gene drives to the manipulation or destruction of inorganic materials.

These and dozens of other cases demonstrate the increasing ease with
which an actor can acquire information and apply existing tools to
deploy advanced genetic engineering applications with limited to no
oversight. In 1975, the U.S. National Institute of Health ("NIH")
established compliance measures for genome engineering that were
enforced through funding restrictions; however, many synthetic biology
innovators can now operate without NIH funding, approval, or even
awareness, and NIH does not oversee research in other countries. Today,
[the financial costs, time limitations, and skill requirements needed to
wield synthetic biology tools have scaled down such that some of these
tools have become accessible even to **elementary school
students**]{.underline}. Furthermore, the requisite baseline knowledge
diminishes over time as synthetic biology processes become more
streamlined. While such broad access to sophisticated genetic
engineering knowledge and equipment can accelerate scientific
breakthroughs, [it also places the responsibility for biosecurity on a
near infinite number of unsupervised actors across the
globe]{.underline}.

### AT: No Food Wars

#### A [litany of empirical]{.underline} studies prove food security are the largest determinant of conflict

**Cuesta 2014** - Senior Economist at the World Bank \[Jose, \"Food
Price Watch,\" May,
www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/Poverty%20documents/FPW_May%202014_final.pdf\]

[Dozens of violent episodes across the world were reported during the
food price hikes of 2007 and 2008]{.underline}.55 And others have since
followed. Casualties associated with such episodes---popularly known as
"food riots" (yet somewhat arbitrarily defined, box 1)---in Argentina,
Cameroon, Haiti and India, to cite a few, made world headlines. There
have been violent episodes also associated with low prices, such as
those involving coffee producers in Vietnam (or cotton producers in
Burkina Faso).56 [These episodes remind us about the close relationship
between food insecurity and conflict]{.underline}. Furthermore, the
world has grown accustomed to seeing a different angle of the
food-conflict nexus: foodrelated humanitarian disaster and famines
were---and continue to be---associated with civil conflict and
interstate wars, for example, the recent Somalia famine. But the other
link, the food-to-conflict connection is hardly news, and, as the father
of the Green Revolution and Nobel Laureate Norman Borlaug eloquently put
it: "[we cannot build world peace on empty stomachs and human misery."
The interrelated and bidirectional connection between food and war has
also been emphasized in the works of Amartya Sen, Jean Drèze, and
anthropologist Ellen Messner, who coined the term "food
wars]{.underline}."57 [Food price shocks can be responsible for the
origination and continuation of conflict and,]{.underline} more
generally[, political instability. Increasing empirical evidence shows
that international food prices and the domestic pass through to local
markets of these international prices has a significant role in all
types of conflict]{.underline}, from interstate wars to civil wars,
[regime breakdowns, and communal violence.]{.underline}58 [Food price
shocks may cause spontaneous and largely urban sociopolitical
instability]{.underline}, with urban food consumers as the primary
protesters.59 In these cases, [price shocks can trigger sociopolitical
unrest, fueling preexisting grievances]{.underline}---including poverty
and other disparities---[and highlighting the lack of adequate social
safety nets and other compensating policies]{.underline}.60 This is the
case, for example, with protests in Guinea and Mauritania in 2007 and
Haiti in 2008.61 Yet, some argue that poverty is not a precondition for
such protests, and, in fact, some of these protests did not necessarily
always engage the poorest or hungriest individuals nor countries (for
example, protests organized by consumers' associations in Senegal and
trade unions in Burkina Faso in 2008).62 Either way, those s[hocks
reduce a country's capability of producing, purchasing, and providing
access to food]{.underline}, thus [increasing the risk of food
insecurity and,]{.underline} consequently, the likelihood of protests
and [escalated conflict.]{.underline}63 But food prices are not the only
cause or contributor to violent protests associated with food.64 More
structural pressures, such as competition--- intra or interstate---over
natural resources such as land, water, fisheries, labor, or capital may
well cause political instability and unrest. Farmers and farm workers
become, in such cases, the main agitators, more likely developing into
social movements than riots from price shocks in urban settings.65 This
is the case, for example, in land grabs in Madagascar that in 2009 were
reported to contribute to a coup that ousted then President
Ravalomanana, or the violent protests concerning genetically modified
food in the Philippines in 2013.66 Consequently, the attention given to
conflict jeopardizing food security (by reducing agricultural production
and forcing displacement of people) during the last decades needs to be
expanded. A more encompassing view should also incorporate the fact that
food insecurity in general, and food price shocks in particular, also
contribute to instability and conflict[. Monitoring food
prices]{.underline} (table 3 and figure 2[) responds not only to food
security and welfare interests, but also to serious political
instability and conflict motivations.]{.underline} As a result, a proper
monitoring constitutes a first step in addressing the interactions
between food insecurity and conflict.

beyond existing mechanisms like the BWC or the CWC (The Convention on

ENTER THE DRAGON

[There has never been any doubt about what China wants, because Chinese
leaders have declared the same objectives for decades: to keep
the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party ([CCP) in power, reabsorb
Taiwan, control the East]{.underline} China [and South China Seas, and
return China to its rightful place as the dominant power in Asia and the
most powerful country in the world]{.underline}. For most of the past
four decades, the country took a relatively patient and peaceful
approach to achieving these aims. Focused on economic growth and fearful
of being shunned by the international community, [China adopted a
"peaceful rise" strategy]{.underline}, relying primarily on economic
clout to advance its interests [and generally following a maxim
of]{.underline} the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping: "[Hide your strength,
bide your time."]{.underline}

In recent years, however, [China has expanded aggressively on multiple
fronts.]{.underline} "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy has replaced friendship
diplomacy. Perceived slights from foreigners, no matter how small, are
met with North Korean--style condemnation. A combative attitude has
seeped into every part of China's foreign policy, and it is confronting
many countries with their gravest threat in generations.

[This threat is most apparent in maritime East Asia]{.underline}, where
[China is moving aggressively to cement its vast territorial claims.
Beijing is churning out warships faster than any country has since World
War II, and it has flooded Asian sea-lanes]{.underline} with Chinese
coast guard and fishing vessels. It [has strung military outposts across
the South China Sea and dramatically increased its use of ship ramming
and aerial interceptions]{.underline} to shove neighbors out of disputed
areas[. In the Taiwan Strait,]{.underline} Chinese military
[patrols]{.underline}, some involving a dozen warships and more than 50
combat aircraft, [prowl the sea almost daily and simulate attacks on
Taiwanese and U.S. targets]{.underline}. Chinese officials have told
Western analysts that calls for an invasion of Taiwan are proliferating
within the CCP. Pentagon officials worry that such an assault could be
imminent.

[China has gone on the economic offensive,]{.underline} too. Its latest
five-year plan calls for dominating what Chinese officials call
"chokepoints"---goods and services that other countries can't live
without---[and then using that dominance, plus the lure of China's
domestic market, to browbeat countries into concessions]{.underline}.
Toward that end, China has become the dominant dispenser of overseas
loans, loading up more than 150 countries with over \$1 trillion of
debt. It has massively subsidized strategic industries to gain a
monopoly on hundreds of vital products, and it has installed the
hardware for digital networks in dozens of countries. Armed with
economic leverage, it has used coercion against more than a dozen
countries over the last few years. In many cases, the punishment has
been disproportionate to the supposed crime---for example, slapping
tariffs on many of Australia's exports after that country requested an
international investigation into the origins of COVID-19.

[China has also become a potent antidemocratic force, selling advanced
tools of tyranny around the world]{.underline}. [By combining
surveillance cameras with social media monitoring, artificial
intelligence, biometrics, and speech and facial recognition
technologies, the Chinese government has pioneered a system that allows
dictators to watch citizens constantly and punish them instantly by
blocking their access to finance, education, employment,
telecommunications,]{.underline} or travel. The apparatus is a despot's
dream, and Chinese companies are already selling and operating aspects
of it in more than 80 countries.

ACTION AND REACTION

As China burns down what remains of the liberal order, it is sparking an
international backlash. Negative views of the country have soared around
the world to highs not seen since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. A
2021 survey by the Pew Research Center found that roughly 75 percent of
people in the United States, Europe, and Asia held unfavorable views of
China and had no confidence that President Xi Jinping would behave
responsibly in world affairs or respect human rights. Another survey, a
2020 poll by the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
revealed that about 75 percent of foreign policy elites in those same
places thought that the best way to deal with China was to form
coalitions of like-minded countries against it. In the United States,
both political parties now support a tough policy toward China. The EU
has officially declared China to be a "systemic rival." In Asia, Beijing
faces openly hostile governments in every direction, from Japan to
Australia to Vietnam to India. Even people in countries that trade
heavily with China are souring on it. Surveys show that South Koreans,
for example, now dislike China more than they dislike Japan, their
former colonial overlord.

Anti-Chinese sentiment is starting to congeal into concrete pushback.
The resistance remains embryonic and patchy, mainly because so many
countries are still hooked on Chinese trade. But the overall trend is
clear: disparate actors are starting to join forces to roll back
Beijing's power. In the process, they are reordering the world.

The emerging anti-Chinese order departs fundamentally from the liberal
order, because it is directed at a different threat. In particular, the
new order flips the relative emphasis placed on capitalism versus
democracy. During the Cold War, the old liberal order promoted
capitalism first and democracy a distant second. The United States and
its allies pushed free markets as far as their power could reach, but
when forced to choose, they almost always supported right-wing autocrats
over left-wing democrats. The so-called free world was mainly an
economic construct. Even after the Cold War, when democracy promotion
became a cottage industry in Western capitals, the United States and its
allies often shelved human rights concerns to gain market access, as
they did most notably by ushering China into the WTO.

But [now economic openness has become a liability for the United States
and its allies, because China is ensconced in virtually every aspect of
the liberal order.]{.underline} [Far from being put out of business by
globalization, China's authoritarian capitalist system seems almost
perfectly designed to milk free markets for mercantilist
gain]{.underline}. Beijing uses subsidies and espionage to help its
firms dominate global markets and protects its domestic market with
nontariff barriers. [It censors foreign ideas and companies on its own
internet and freely accesses the global Internet to steal intellectual
property and spread CCP propaganda]{.underline}. It assumes leadership
positions in liberal international institutions, such as the UN Human
Rights Council, and then bends them in an illiberal direction. It enjoys
secure shipping around the globe for its export machine, courtesy of the
U.S. Navy, and uses its own military to assert control over large swaths
of the East China and South China Seas.

[The United States and its allies have awoken to the danger: the liberal
order and,]{.underline} in particular, [the globalized economy at its
heart are empowering a dangerous adversary.]{.underline} In response,
they are trying to build a new order that excludes China by making
democracy a requirement for full membership. When U.S. President Joe
Biden gave his first press conference, in March 2021, and described the
U.S.-Chinese rivalry as part of a broader competition between democracy
and autocracy, it wasn't a rhetorical flourish. He was drawing a battle
line based on a widely shared belief that authoritarian capitalism poses
a mortal threat to the democratic world, one that can't be contained by
the liberal order. Instead of reforming existing rules, rich democracies
are starting to impose new ones by banding together, adopting
progressive standards and practices, and threatening to exclude
countries that don't follow them. Democracies aren't merely balancing
against China---increasing their defense spending and forming military
alliances---they are also reordering the world around it.

### AT: Chinese Tech leadership inevitable

#### American tech leadership is what keeps China at bay -- the plan is what makes the shift inevitable.

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

The architecture of the new order remains a work in progress. Yet two
key features are already discernible. The first is a loose economic bloc
anchored by the G-7, the group of democratic allies that controls more
than half of the world's wealth. These leading powers, along with a
rotating cast of [like-minded states, are collaborating to prevent China
from monopolizing the global economy.]{.underline} History has shown
that whichever power dominates the strategic goods and services of an
era dominates that era. In the nineteenth century, the United Kingdom
was able to build an empire on which the sun never set in part because
it mastered iron, steam, and the telegraph faster than its competitors.
In the twentieth century, [the United States surged ahead of other
countries by harnessing steel, chemicals, electronics, aerospace, and
information technologies]{.underline}. Now, [China hopes to dominate
modern strategic sectors---including artificial intelligence,
biotechnology, semiconductors, and telecommunications]{.underline}---and
relegate other economies to subservient status. In a 2017 meeting in
Beijing, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told H. R. McMaster, then the U.S.
national security adviser, how he envisioned the United States and other
countries fitting into the global economy in the future: their role,
McMaster recalled Li saying, "would merely be to provide China with raw
materials, agricultural products, and energy to fuel its production of
the world's cutting-edge industrial and consumer products."

To avoid becoming a cog in a Chinese economic empire, leading
democracies have started forming exclusive trade and investment networks
designed to speed up their progress in critical sectors and slow down
China's. Some of these collaborations, such as the U.S.-Japan
Competitiveness and Resilience Partnership, announced in 2021, create
joint R & D projects to help members outpace Chinese innovation. Other
schemes focus on blunting China's economic leverage by developing
alternatives to Chinese products and funding. The G-7's Build Back
Better World initiative and the EU's Global Gateway, for example, will
provide poor countries with infrastructure financing as an alternative
to China's Belt and Road Initiative. Australia, India, and Japan joined
forces to start the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative, which offers
incentives for their companies to move their operations out of China.
And at the behest of the United States, countries composing more than 60
percent of the world's cellular-equipment market have enacted or are
considering restrictions against Huawei, China's main 5G
telecommunications provider.

Meanwhile, [democratic coalitions are constraining China's access to
advanced technologies.]{.underline} The Netherlands, South Korea,
Taiwan, and the United States, for example, [have colluded to cut China
off from advanced semiconductors and from the machines that make them.
New institutions are laying the groundwork for a full-scale multilateral
export control regime]{.underline}. The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology
Council creates common transatlantic standards for screening exports to
China and investment there in artificial intelligence and other
cutting-edge technologies. [The Export Controls and Human Rights
Initiative]{.underline}, a joint project of Australia, Canada, Denmark,
France, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United
States that was unveiled in late 2021, [is intended to do the same for
technologies that could support digital authoritarianism,]{.underline}
such as speech and facial recognition tools. [The United States and its
democratic allies are also negotiating trade and investment deals to
discriminate against China]{.underline}, putting in place labor,
environmental, and governance standards that Beijing will never meet. In
October 2021, for example, the United States and the EU agreed to create
a new arrangement that will impose tariffs on aluminum and steel
producers that engage in dumping or carbon-intensive production, a
measure that will hit no country harder than China.

T[he second feature of the emerging order is a double military barrier
to contain China. The inside layer consists of rivals bordering the East
China and South China Seas.]{.underline} Many of them---including
Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam---are loading up
on mobile missile launchers and mines. [The goal is to turn themselves
into prickly porcupines capable of denying China sea and air control
near their shores]{.underline}. Those efforts are now being bolstered by
an outside layer of democratic powers---mainly Australia, India, the
United Kingdom, and the United States. These democracies are providing
aid, arms, and intelligence to China's neighbors; training together so
they can conduct long-range missile strikes on Chinese forces and
blockade China's oil imports; and organizing multinational
freedom-of-navigation exercises throughout the region, especially near
Chinese-held rocks, reefs, and islands in disputed areas.

[This security cooperation is becoming stronger and more
institutionalized. Witness the reemergence of the]{.underline}
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, [or Quad---]{.underline}a coalition
made up of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States that had gone
dormant shortly after its founding in 2007. Or look at the creation of
new pacts, most notably AUKUS, an alliance linking Australia, the United
Kingdom, and the United States. The overarching goal of all this
activity is to maintain the territorial status quo in East Asia. But [a
more explicit aim is to save Taiwan, the frontline democracy most at
risk of Chinese conquest. Japan and the United States have developed a
joint battle plan for defending the island,]{.underline} and in November
2021, Peter Dutton, Australia's defense minister, said it was
"inconceivable" that his country would not also join the fight. The
European Parliament, for its part, has adopted a comprehensive plan to
boost Taiwan's economic resilience and international recognition.

Viewed individually, these efforts look haphazard and reactive.
Collectively, however, they betray a positive vision for a democratic
order, one that differs fundamentally from China's mercantilist model
and also from the old international order, with neoliberal orthodoxy at
its core. By infusing labor and human rights standards into economic
agreements, the new vision prioritizes people over corporate profits and
state power. It also elevates the global environment from a mere
commodity to a shared and jointly protected commons. By linking
democratic governments together in an exclusive network, the new order
attempts to force countries to make a series of value judgments and
imposes real penalties for illiberal behavior. Want to make
carbon-intensive steel with slave labor? Prepare to be hit with tariffs
by the world's richest countries. Considering annexing international
waters? Expect a visit from a multinational armada.

[If China continues to scare democracies into collective action, then it
could usher in the most consequential changes to global governance in a
generation or more]{.underline}. By containing Chinese naval expansion,
for example, the maritime security system in East Asia could become a
powerful enforcement mechanism for the law of the sea. [By inserting
carbon tariffs into trade deals to discriminate against China, the
United States and its allies could force producers to reduce their
emissions,]{.underline} inadvertently creating the basis for a de facto
international carbon tax. The Quad's success in providing one billion
doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Southeast Asia, an effort to win hearts
and minds away from Beijing, has provided a blueprint for combating
future pandemics. Allied efforts to prevent the spread of digital
authoritarianism could inspire new international regulations on digital
flows and data privacy, and the imperative of competing with China could
fuel an unprecedented surge in R & D and infrastructure spending around
the world.

Like the orders of the past, [the emerging one is an order of exclusion,
sustained by fear and enforced through coercion.]{.underline} Unlike
most past orders, however, it is directed toward progressive ends.

WHAT CHINA WANTS

Andrew [Nathan]{.underline} focuses less on engagement than on how
U.S.-Chinese strategic competition is evolving. He [worries that I am
"hyping" the China threat and "creating panic]{.underline}." He does not
say China is a paper tiger, but he leans in that direction.
Specifically, [he maintains that the country "suffers from major
weaknesses]{.underline}" and is not going to become a regional hegemon,
much less the most powerful state in the world.

I never said China was in fact going to dominate Asia or attain global
primacy. Rather, I argued that [as China grows more powerful, it will
try to achieve those goals.]{.underline} In response, [the United States
and its allies will go to great lengths to contain China, as they did
with imperial Germany, imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet
Union.]{.underline} Whether China succeeds remains to be seen.
Regardless, the [ensuing competition between Beijing and Washington is
likely to be more dangerous than Nathan seems to think]{.underline}.

Taiwan is a case in point. Nathan recognizes that as China tries "to
push the United States away from its shores and weaken its alliances,"
there will be "a real chance of conflict, especially over Taiwan." But
he sees Taiwan from a purely realist perspective, rejecting my argument
that [nationalism might help fuel a conflict over Taiwan on the grounds
that my characterization makes "China sound irrationally
aggressive]{.underline}." In fact, [Beijing views Taiwan as sacred
territory and is deeply committed to making it part of
China.]{.underline} Japan and the United States stand in the way,
however, which antagonizes many Chinese and makes the likelihood of
conflict over that island greater than realist logic alone would
predict.

Then there is Nathan's claim that "China suffers from major weaknesses"
that will severely hamper its efforts to dominate Asia. [China does
confront several challenges, but Nathan overstates them.]{.underline} It
does contain numerous minority groups, for example, but 92 percent of
its population is Han Chinese, and there is little evidence that ethnic
unrest is sapping Chinese power. Nathan claims that China operates in a
multipolar world in which it faces "five powerful rivals." But [the
European Union is not a country, India and Japan are not great powers,
and Russia is not an adversary. The United States is China's only
great-power rival.]{.underline} Of course, [China will have to contend
with a U.S.-led balancing coalition that includes India and Japan, but
that is a far cry from facing five great powers well positioned to stop
it from achieving regional hegemony]{.underline}. Making the situation
even more favorable to China is the fact that India, Japan, and the
United States are thousands of miles apart, which will impair their
ability to work together to contain China. Moreover, [China is not as
friendless as Nathan portrays it]{.underline} to be: the country [has
fostered]{.underline} increasingly [friendly relations with]{.underline}
two of its most **[powerful neighbors]{.underline}**, [Pakistan and
Russia.]{.underline}

The most serious difficulty [Nathan identifies is China's aging
population]{.underline}, but it is hard to know what its effects will be
in the foreseeable future[. Beijing will surely turn to automation to
mitigate the problem]{.underline}, which anyway will take a few decades
to have a significant impact. Also, [many of China's competitors are
dealing with similar demographic challenges]{.underline}, including
Japan, South Korea, and even the United States to some extent. Nathan
argues that China's economy is likely to slow down markedly moving
forward, and he may be right, but it is difficult to know how much that
economy will grow in the next few decades (and how the U.S. economy will
perform over that same period). After all, few experts predicted China's
spectacular growth over the past 30 years. But even if the country's
economy grows more slowly than it has in recent [years, it will still be
enormously powerful and will provide Beijing with the military
wherewithal to cause its neighbors and the United States much
trouble]{.underline}.

THE ODDS OF WAR

Susan Thornton disagrees with my categorization of engagement after the
Cold War as a serious "strategic blunder," arguing that the policy
"lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty," which is "a
major human achievement." I agree, but that accomplishment has little to
do with the security of the United States, which is the issue on the
table[. Thornton never explains why a policy that hastened the emergence
of a formidable peer competitor was not,]{.underline} from the U.S.
perspective, [a colossal misstep.]{.underline}

Thornton recognizes that China and the United States are now engaged in
an intense security competition---which makes one wonder why she has no
reservations about the policy of engagement that got us here. It may be
because she is not worried that the rivalry will lead to war, arguing
that "there are a number of formidable restraints in place to keep the
peace." She maintains that in contrast I believe that the rivalry is
"inexorably leading" to "an apocalyptic war." But I did not say that war
is inevitable. Indeed, I emphasized that war is unlikely. After
describing the different ways fighting might break out, I wrote, "None
of this is to say that these limited-war scenarios are likely." To be
clear[, I recognize that there are significant barriers to armed
conflict. Those barriers are not impregnable,]{.underline} however[, as

It is worth remembering that [great powers were heavily engaged with one
another before the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, the Franco-Prussian
War, World War I, and World War II.]{.underline} In some cases, [they

anyway.]{.underline} And [despite what Thornton may wish, victory is
still possible in modern war]{.underline}; not every conflict leads to
"certain catastrophic losses for all," as she says a U.S.-Chinese war
would. [War is always a real possibility when great powers struggle over
regional hegemony]{.underline}. [Helping China rise rapidly made a clash

#### America might have a sketchy past -- but liberal democracy is better than any alternative. The alt would simply cede Europe to Putin. 

**Hamid \'22** - Senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and
assistant research professor of Islamic studies at Fuller Seminary
\[Shadi, 3/6/22, \"There Are Many Things Worse Than American Power,\"
https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/putin-kremlin-imperialism-ukraine-american-power/624180/\]

If there was any doubt before, the answer is now clear. Vladimir [Putin
is showing that a world without American power]{.underline}---or, for
that matter, Western power---[is not a better world]{.underline}.

[For the generation of Americans who came of age in the shadow of the
September 11]{.underline} attacks, [the world America had made came with
a question mark.]{.underline} [Their formative experiences were the ones
in which American power had been used for ill]{.underline}, in Iraq and
Afghanistan. In the Middle East more broadly, and for much longer, the
United States had built a security architecture around some of the
world's most repressive regimes. [For those on the left]{.underline},
this was nothing new, [and it was all too obvious]{.underline}. I spent
my college years reading Noam Chomsky and other leftist critics of U.S.
foreign policy, and they weren't entirely wrong. On balance, the U.S.
may have been a force for good, but in particular regions and at
particular times, it had been anything but.

[Blaming America first became all too easy]{.underline}. After September
11, [U.S. power was as overwhelming as it was uncontested. That it was
squandered on two endless wars]{.underline} made it convenient to focus
on America's sins, while underplaying Russia's and China's growing
ambitions.

For his part, Putin understood well that the balance of power was
shifting. Knowing what he knew, the Russian president wasn't necessarily
"irrational" in deciding to invade Ukraine. He had good reason to think
that he could get away with it. After all, he had gotten away with quite
a lot for nearly 15 years, ever since the Russian war against Georgia in
2008, when George W. Bush was still president. Then he annexed Crimea in
2014 and intervened brutally in Syria in 2015. Each time, in an
understandable desire to avoid an escalatory spiral with Russia, the
United States held back and tried not to do anything that might provoke
Putin. Meanwhile, Europe became more and more dependent on Russian
energy; Germany, for example, was importing 55 percent of its natural
gas from Russia. Just three weeks ago, it was possible for Der Spiegel
to declare that most Germans thought "peace with Russia is the only
thing that matters."

[The narrative of a feckless and divided West solidified for
years]{.underline}. We, as Americans, were feeling unsure of ourselves,
so it was only reasonable that Putin would feel it too. In such a
context, and [after four years of Donald Trump and the domestic turmoil
that he wrought, it was tempting to valorize "restraint" and limited
engagements abroad]{.underline}. [Worried about imperial
overreach,]{.underline} most of [the American left opposed direct U.S.
military action against]{.underline} Bashar al-[Assad']{.underline}s
regime in the early 2010s, even though it was Russian and Iranian
intervention on behalf of Syria's dictator that bore the marks of a real
imperial enterprise, not just an imagined one.

[Russia's unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation]{.underline}, in
Europe no less, has [put matters back in their proper
framing]{.underline}. The question of whether the United States is a
uniquely malevolent force in global politics has been resolved. In the
span of a few days, [skeptics of American power have gotten a taste of
what a world where America grows weak and Russia grows strong looks
like]{.underline}. Of course, [there are still holdouts who insist on
seeing the United States as the provocateur.]{.underline} In its only
public statement on Ukraine, the Democratic Socialists of America
condemned Russia's invasion but also called for "the U.S. to withdraw
from NATO and to end the imperialist expansionism that set the stage for
this conflict." This is an odd statement considering that [Russia,
rather than the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [has been the
world's most unabashedly imperialist force for the past three
decades.]{.underline} But [many on the anti-imperialist left aren't
really anti-imperialist; they just have an instinctive aversion to
American power.]{.underline}

America's low opinion of its own capacity for good---and the resulting
desire to retreat or disengage---hasn't just been a preoccupation of the
far left. The crisis of confidence has been pervasive, spreading to the
halls of power and even President Barack Obama, whose memorable mantra
was "Don't do stupid shit." Instead of thinking about what we could do,
or what we could do better, Obama was more interested in a self-limiting
principle. For their part, European powers---content to bask under their
U.S. security umbrella---could afford to believe in fantasies of
perpetual peace. Europe's gentleness and lethargy---coaxing Germany to
commit even 2 percent of its GDP to defense seemed impossible---became
something of a joke. One popular Twitter account, \@ISEUConcerned,
devoted itself to mocking the European Union's propensity to express
"concern," but do little else, whenever something bad happened.

Suddenly, [the EU has been aroused from its slumber,]{.underline} and
the parody account was rendered temporarily speechless. [This is no
longer tepid concern, but righteous fury. Member states announced that
they would send anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. Germany]{.underline}, for
the first time, [said that it would ramp up its military
budget]{.underline} to 100 billion euros. On the economic front, the EU
announced some of the toughest sanctions in history. My podcast co-host,
Damir Marusic, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, likened it to a "holy
war," European-style.

Sometimes, unusual and extreme events mark the separation between old
and new ways of thinking and being. This week, the Berlin-based
journalist Elizabeth Zerofsky remarked that [the current moment reminded
her of the memoir The World of Yesterday]{.underline}, written by the
Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig as World War II loomed. In it, he
[recalls the twilight of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with an almost
naive fondness]{.underline}. On the first day of the Ukraine invasion, I
happened to be speaking to a group of college students who had no memory
of September 11. I told them that they may be living in history. Those
students, like all of us, are bearing witness to one of those rare
events that recast how individuals and nations alike view the world they
inhabit.

The coming weeks, months, and years are likely to be as fascinating as
they are terrifying. In a sense, [we knew that a great confrontation was
coming, even if we hadn't quite envisioned its precise
contours]{.underline}. At the start of his presidency, Joe Biden
declared that the battle between democracies and autocracies would be
the defining struggle of our time. This was grandiose rhetoric, but was
it more than that? What does it actually mean to fight such a battle?

In any number of ways, [Russia's aggression has underscored why Biden
was right and why authoritarians]{.underline}---[and the authoritarian
idea itself---are such a threat to peace and stability]{.underline}.
[Russia invaded Ukraine, a democracy, because of the recklessness and
domination of one man]{.underline}, Vladimir Putin. [The countries that
have rallied most enthusiastically behind Ukraine have almost uniformly
been democracies, chief among them the United States**. America is
lousy**]{.underline}, disappointing, [and maddeningly
hypocritical]{.underline} in its conduct abroad, [but the notion of any
moral equivalence between the United States and Putin's Russia has
**been rendered laughable**]{.underline}. And [if there is such a thing
as a better world, then anti-imperialists may find themselves in the odd
position of hoping and praying for the health and longevity of not just
the West but of Western power]{.underline}.

#### Finance and military [lock-in]{.underline} US dominance

**Tooze '21** - Shelby Cullom Davis chair of History at Columbia

\[Adam; Sep 8; "The new age of American power;"
<https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2021/09/new-age-american-power>\]

In August 2021, the dismaying scenes at Kabul airport stirred a number
of gloomy pronouncements about the decline of American power. The
anguished tone of these reactions reflects not just the horror on the
ground, but a sense of personal betrayal felt by the pundit class. For
anyone with a historical imagination, the dishonourable retreat is the
latest act in the grand drama of Western decline. The wreck in Central
Asia set against China's rising GDP makes for a bitter mix. China will
supplant the US as the world's ascendant power. The One Belt One Road
initiative that already stretches from Shanghai to Karachi will subsume
Afghanistan as well. We are headed for a post-American age.

Compelling though this declinist verdict may be, it is misleading. In
two key ways, **[American power continues to define the world
order]{.underline}**.

The [first **is through finance**]{.underline}. With respect to global
money -- not to be confused with trade or economic growth -- [the dollar
still rules.]{.underline} Much of [the world's payments, credit and
finance continues to rely on the US currency]{.underline}. Since 2001,
Afghanistan's backwater economy has been sucked into that system. [The
Taliban]{.underline} may have rejoiced at the conquest of Kabul, but
[when it tried to lay its hands on Afghanistan's national exchange
reserves]{.underline}, most of which are held by the New York Fed, the
group discovered that it still resides in the US's world -- or at least
Afghanistan's money does.

The [second]{.underline} dimension of **[American power is
military]{.underline}**. US planners have bungled the exit from Kabul,
but that should not distract from the world-historic weight of US
military might. [The US has defined the global order since the
1940s]{.underline}, when it first emerged as a military hyper-power with
a vast navy and an unparalleled nuclear-armed air force. It continues to
do so. The [withdrawal from Afghanistan does not surrender that
pre-eminence.]{.underline} Instead[, it is part of a broader
realignment]{.underline} that began under Barack Obama.

The place to decipher its logic and direction is not Kabul airport or in
the sound and fury of the op-ed pages, but in the budgets of the
Pentagon and the strategies that direct them. Far from conceding a
post-American world, the [US military leadership is girding itself to
meet new challenges]{.underline}. It is not oblivious to China's
economic growth but [their intention is to break the link between GDP
and military power by denying China strategic tech]{.underline}nologies
and [by sharpening America's]{.underline} own
[tech]{.underline}nological [edge.]{.underline}

#### Top-down bans fail -- instead we need adaptive policies like the aff. 

**Hamilton \'21** \[R. Alexander Hamilton, Ruth Mampuys, S. E. Galaitsi,

\"Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Considerations for Top-Down
Governance for Biosecurity and Synthetic Biology,\" in *Emerging Threats
of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology*, pp 37--58\]

Claims about synthetic biology's potential, like other emerging
technologies, nonetheless tend to overstate its 'enabling' capacity.
[Likewise, the ease of producing biological weapons tends to be
overstated.]{.underline} As a number of commentators note, [biology is
not yet easy to engineer]{.underline} (Jefferson et al. 2014) [and, for
the foreseeable future, the skills necessary to produce biological
weapons are likely to remain only within the grasp of
states]{.underline} (Piers Millet in Regalado 2016). However, [the
field's emphasis on eliminating technical barriers and reducing the
importance of tacit knowledge]{.underline} (Oye 2012) [represents a
powerful source of expectation for advocates and critics
alike.]{.underline} For advocates, it represents the possible
realization of modern biology's full potential, one that could yield
revolutionary advances in health, medicine, and industry in the
twenty-first century. For critics, it represents a seemingly open-ended
risk that requires exceptional precaution. [For national governments,
and international conventions responsible for establishing global
biosecurity norms and obligations that are operationalized at the
national level through legislation and other regulatory
tools]{.underline} (McLeish and Nightingale 2007), [a central question
is how]{.underline} (if at all) [does top-down biosecurity governance
need to change in response to synthetic biology?]{.underline}

Regulatory considerations of this kind are both familiar and new
(Hamilton 2015). In the 1970s, recombinant DNA technology similarly
emerged as a source of significant and contrasting expectations, and
questions were posed about the suitability of existing regulatory
approaches in light of potentially novel risks. However, in the case of
recombinant DNA technology, biosafety concerns -- notably, concens about
the possible unintended consequences of genetically modified organisms
(GMOs) -- were the primary focus of scientific deliberations at the
Asilomar Conference and subsequent policy discussions. In the case of
synthetic biology, a field that has emerged at a time of heightened
concerns about (bio)terrorism, the possibility that synthetic biology
could enable non-state actors to acquire (novel) biological agents that
could be used as weapons has been an omnipresent source of concern. In
2009, synthetic biology came to the attention of the US Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) and in 2016 gene editing was listed as a
potential weapon of mass destruction (WMD) by the US Intelligence
Community (Ledford 2010; Clapper 2016).

To more fully understand the top-down governance challenges introduced
by synthetic biology it is necessary to consider how synthetic biology's
novelties could disrupt or potentially undermine existing biosecurity
regulations. In this chapter, we attempt to advance this discussion in
several ways. First, we consider the scope and content of existing
biosecurity regulations at the international and national levels.
Second, we discuss several aspects of synthetic biology that present
distinct regulatory challenges. Finally, we conclude with
recommendations for strengthening current approaches to top-down
biosecurity governance.

Taken together, we argue [that although synthetic biology appears to be
broadly]{.underline} (if indirectly) [covered by existing international
and national regulatory systems, several novelties underline the
limitations of top-down governance approaches premised upon prohibiting
access to specific 'intrinsically dangerous' scientific
artifacts]{.underline} (McLeish and Nightingale 2007). Indeed, by some
accounts, [such restrictions may not only be ineffective, but may also
make the world less safe. In an era of synthetic biology]{.underline} --
characterized by technology convergence[, increased access to
bioengineering capabilities, and rapid growth in intangible life science
knowledge -- top-down governance must be increasingly adaptive, and
hybrid forms of governance]{.underline} (incorporating a 'mix' of
top-down and bottom-up approaches that leverage the self-governance
potential of non-governmental actors) [should be
encouraged.]{.underline}

[Synthetic biology is a transformative technology with the possibility
to change the world to the same extent as]{.underline} -- if not more
than -- [the digital revolution]{.underline}. As is the case with
previous scientific breakthroughs, [the potential for its dual-use and
misuse represents a global problem, and necessitates that the highest
levels of policy makers pay it close attention]{.underline}. Although
targeted countermeasures can go some way toward providing protection,
preventative actions are likely to be more effective given the
heightened uncertainty of the field's future (Trump et al. 2020a). [It
is necessary that biosecurity policies and practices be updated to take
into account both the unprecedented challenges associated with synthetic
biology and the globalized]{.underline}, diffuse, and varied [nature of
its threat space.]{.underline}

[Effective global biosecurity will not happen quickly,]{.underline} nor
will it be enthusiastically adopted by all national governments and
non-governmental organizations[. Incentives to misuse synthetic biology
with harmful consequences remain high for certain negligent actors, as
are the incentives to dual-use by nefarious actors, and the coming years
may see such events affecting human or environmental health. Successful
biosecurity implementation must be **adaptable to quickly incorporate
uncertainty as well as new capabilities**]{.underline}. [Urgent steps
are required to place such notions into practice before a major threat
incident]{.underline}, which in addition to creating substantial damages
could usher in policy changes that might limit or ban platforms of
synthetic biology research entirely. [Besides forgoing the benefits of
the technology, such **a ban could force development underground** and
further out of the reach of coordinated governance or risk assessment.
By identifying the social, economic, institutional, and technological
tripwires that influence a state's trajectory towards biosecurity
research of concern]{.underline}, [now is the time to take steps to
apply biosecurity to maximize technological benefits while minimizing
the dual-use potential of synthetic biology]{.underline} by improving
the framing, prioritization, and governance of biosecurity risks.

[A laissez-faire governance approach cedes much of the regulatory power
to existing or emerging bottom-up initiatives, placing trust in the
capacity of technology producers]{.underline}, industry and users to
play an active role in their own regulation. Under this approach, such
non-governmental actors are encouraged to determine (at least in part)
how safety and security practices are structured, implemented and
enforced, while centralized government plays a role in setting minimum
standards and intervening in the event of regulatory failures. [This
approach is generally intended to promote innovation and
flexibility]{.underline}, as well as rapid adaption and response to
emerging threats (Linkov et al. 2018a, b).

[While laissez-faire governance is a promising approach that recognizes
the important role that non-governmental actors]{.underline} can play in
the regulatory process, **[there are also potential
pitfalls]{.underline}**. One such example, albeit focused on bioethics
rather than biosecurity, can be traced to [the use of germline editing
in humans to produce the first CRISPR baby]{.underline}. In this case,
[despite broad international agreement that scientists should "hold off
on editing human eggs, sperm or embryos until gene-editing technology
(]{.underline}and the implications of the edits) [are better
understood]{.underline}."Footnote13 (See also Cyranoski and Ledford
2018), a researcher in China took advantage of laissez-faire regulatory
controls that resulted in multiple potential risks and unintended
consequences. [These included the possibility of long-term changes to
the human germline; encouraging other scientists]{.underline} (including
those working internationally) [to pursue germline editing in
humans]{.underline} (Cyranoski 2019a, b), and [motivating Chinese
regulators to introduce stricter regulatory controls on genetic
research]{.underline} (ibid.).

As the above example suggests, [one risk of laissez-faire governance is
that an individual's risk tolerance may not]{.underline} (intentionally
or unintentionally) [conform to existing norms and their actions may
subsequently expose everyone to undue risk or irreversible
harm]{.underline}, with implications for the laissez-faire state as well
as other states. Additionally, [the more a state relies on soft law, the
more responsibility the government delegates to individuals, groups and
organizations, not only to establish norms and follow them]{.underline},
but also to enforce them. In the case of synthetic biology, such
bottom-up initiatives have played an important role in this rapidly
developing field. Organizations such as the International Gene Synthesis
Consortium (IGSC) have come to play an important role in the regulatory
process by, for example, developing industry standards and guidelines
(IGSC 2017). For better or worse, the success of such approaches will
depend on the commitment of non-governmental actors to act in the best
interests of society, valuing safety and security as a public good.

Ultimately[, while a laissez-faire approach may effectively supplement
aspects of centralized government regulation, it cannot be expected to
fully replace it]{.underline}. This is because, as history has shown[,
individual researchers or individual members of industry will sometimes
choose to value personal prestige or cost cutting over safety and
security]{.underline}. Moreover, from the standpoint of non-governmental
actors, including the DNA synthesis consortia noted above, regulation is
not necessarily a bad thing. Indeed, by some accounts, [the standards
and codes of conduct produced by the DNA synthesis industry were
motivated by a lack of top-down regulations that could provide a
benchmark for not only mitigating potential biosecurity risks,
b]{.underline}ut also liability issues and reputational costs in the
event of an incident. For this reason, the US Government's own DNA
screening guidanceFootnote14 has been largely welcomed by industry.

Still, the [problem of how to incentivize private actors to invest in
biosecurity remains]{.underline}. [The answer will require the
participation]{.underline} not only of [bench scientists]{.underline},
but also of various [overseers, gatekeepers, and watchdog groups
involved in biotechnology research and development]{.underline} (for
instance, the World Organisation for Animal Health's Guideline for
Responsible Conduct in Veterinary Research). One example of a potential
approach is to train journal editors to recognize potential information
hazards within article submissions. Additionally, [funders responsible
for reviewing grants could require that applicants include a review of
potential information and security hazards which might occur over the
course of the proposed work]{.underline}. In these and other examples[,
a fusion of top-down and bottom-up approaches is necessary in order to
identify security threats and to raise awareness of biosecurity
issues;]{.underline} meanwhile, bottom-up organizations can develop
on-the-ground passive surveillance programs to monitor potential
dual-use security threats.

An example of this collaboration is between the US Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) and iGEM. [The FBI has funded iGEM and collaborated
with the competition's organizers in order to increase awareness of risk
and to build an understanding of possible or developing
threats.]{.underline} While no biosecurity policy or practice can
completely eliminate all threats (especially not without unilaterally
preventing research and innovation that could greatly benefit society),
[a layered approach in which government, private organizations, and
individual citizens collaborate will result in a more unified effort for
biosecurity which could reduce gaps in oversight that might be exploited
by actors looking to develop biological weapons]{.underline}.

### AT: States

#### States can't solve bioterror. 

**Pedersen, 17**---Pepperdine University (Christian, "Reflecting Back on
the Ebola Outbreak and the Future of Bioterrorism," Pepperdine Policy
Review: Vol. 9, dml)

Terror groups like al-Qaeda and ISIL (the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant) have expressed interested, and have even attempted, to use
biological agents in terror plots (Biodefense, 2016). The technical and
administrative knowledge of biology and chemistry can be acquired
globally in medical schools, research programs, and laboratories, making
it difficult to prevent potential practitioners of bioterrorism from
acquiring the required scientific knowledge (Chiodo, 2015). While at one
time the ability to mutate strands was restricted to advanced research
laboratories, rudimentary high school laboratories now have the ability
to develop deadly biological agents (Garrett, 2012). With relative easy,
terror groups could engineer the flu virus, making it deadlier (Selk,
2017). By combining traits of multiple strains and maximizing the virus'
natural properties, it could become highly transmittable (Farmer, 2107).
Genetically engineered viruses have the potential to kill more people
than nuclear weapons, governments remain underprepared for that threat
(Selk, 2017). Terrorists could be drawn to the use of biological agents
because of the difficulty of detection and the ease at which some
biological agents can naturally spread through a population
(Bioterrorism, 2006). There are essentially three ways which agents
could be acquired by terrorist: they could be stolen, created in
laboratory environments, or collected naturally. A gloomy reality is
that as the advancement of new technologies reduce the costs of genetic
sequencing, it will become easier and less expensive to create novel
organisms (Garrett, 2012). Bioterrorist attacks can be planned to induce
maximum damage and panic with a minimum risk of early detection.
Potential agents of attack are categorized by risk (rated as an, A, B,
or a C) depending on the agent's availability, ease of dissemination and
transmission, and potential impact (Bioterrorism, 2006). Category A
agents are considered the most dangerous and threatening to National
Security. Ebola is categorized as a Category A bioagent because of its
ability to cause mass panic and disruption and the special public health
actions required for treating those infected. Through the EVD, "mother
nature has created the perfect bioweapon" (Thiessen, 2014). Following
the Paris terrorist attacks, the French have warned that terrorist
organizations may attempt to steal biological agents (Talent & Graham,
2016). The British Ministry of Defense feared terrorists would try to
acquire EVD and released a report outlining three separate scenarios in
which terror groups could successfully weaponize the virus. (Quinn,
2015) These could be stolen from research facilities, laboratories, or
government stockpiles. While the more exotic and devastating agents
(such as small pox) must be cultivated in laboratory environments and
are therefore more difficult to obtain, many biological agents are
naturally occurring (Gottron, 2002). Examples of these naturally
occurring, and easier to obtain agents include: human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), the hepatitis strands, yellow fever, and the Ebola virus
(Gottron, 2002). Moreover, the Ebola virus is native to a continent
where terrorist organizations like Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, and the Islamic
State are active (Thiessen, 2014). The 21-day incubation period allows
potential jihadists more than enough time to infect themselves, then
travel to infected population centers, developing the means of mass
distribution (Thiessen, 2014). In June 2001 -- months prior to the
September 11th attack in New York -- Dark [Winter]{.underline}, a senior
level wargame, was [run in conjunction with security think tanks and
government agencies to simulate government responses to acts of
bioterrorism]{.underline} (Dark Winter). [The simulation demonstrated
how a biological terror attack could result in mass civilian casualties,
civil disorder, institutional breakdown and lack of faith in government
-- compromising national security]{.underline} (Dark Winter).
[Major]{.underline} [challenges for policymakers included the many
"fault lines" which existed between governmental agencies, the levels of
government, private healthcare systems, and the public]{.underline}
(Dark Winter). [Breakdowns in centralized leadership and communication
could threaten containment and control]{.underline}. It was revealed
that the healthcare system in the United States had no surge abilities
to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed or to meet the heightened
demand for vaccinations (Dark Winter). [Finally, targeted communications
and information management was recognized as a challenge, both in
working with the media and in disseminating important
information]{.underline} (Dark Winter). It became very clear after the
exercise that the United States was unprepared for an act of
bioterrorism. In 2010, nearly ten years after the Dark Winter exercise,
a commission created to evaluate the national emergency response
capabilities gave the nation a failing grade on its ability to respond
to a bioterrorist threat (O'Grady, 2015).

#### US abdication of NATO responsibilities greenlights Russian invasion of the Middle East

**Shapiro 2019** - Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Institute for
National Security Studies in Tel Aviv Daniel, \"The Most Dangerous Thing
Trump Could Do Yet, and Its Nightmare Fallout for Israel,\" Jan 17,
<https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-trump-leaving-nato-a-nightmare-for-israel-netanyahu-1.6846949>

[Remove the United States from NATO]{.underline} - and forward-deployed
U.S. forces from Europe, which would certainly follow - [and the United
States' ability to respond to a Middle East]{.underline} crisis [would
be diminished.]{.underline}

Could U.S. support for Israel be shifted and coordinated instead through
U.S. Central Command, based in the Persian Gulf? It has been proposed
before as an efficiency measure. But Israeli generals have always
resisted the proposal. Their worry is that they would find it
challenging to enjoy the same level of intimacy they currently have with
Europe-based U.S. commanders, with commanders who maintain a similar
closeness with Arab militaries.

True, Israel is closer strategically today with the Arab Gulf states
than at any time in its history, because of a focus on the common threat
of Iran and the lower priority of the Palestinian issue. But those
relationships are a long way from being normalized - and could still
backslide.

Israeli security planners are, therefore, still most likely to want to
maintain separation between their relationships with the U.S. military
and with their Arab neighbors. Having observed the intense friendships
formed between Israeli military commanders and their U.S. counterparts
based in Europe, I can say that these ties will not be easily replaced.

The broader Middle East would also experience the effects of NATO's
demise in the form of further empowerment of Russia. That is happening
already, but losing NATO would turbocharge those trends.

Already, [Russia's brutally decisive intervention in Syria, combined
with successive U.S. administrations' preference to reduce active U.S.
military engagements in the region, have led many regional states to
explore expanded security ties with Russia]{.underline}.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets more frequently with
Putin than he does with Trump, and the IDF and Russian Air Force
deconflict their operations in Syria. The leaders of Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, all close partners of the United
States, have visited Moscow and explored acquiring advanced Russian
weapons systems in addition to their American-supplied arsenals.

[Should Russia decide to exert leverage, such as by constraining Israeli
freedom of action against Iranian military targets in Syria, the United
States would be ill-equipped to push back]{.underline}.

[A U.S. withdrawal from NATO would unmistakably be understood as a major
pullback]{.underline} from the United States's leadership in global
affairs. [The effect of expanding Russian influence would be
felt]{.underline} far [beyond Europe and the Middle East]{.underline}.

#### That makes WWIII inevitable 

**Hanson 2016** - classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution,

Victor Davis, \"The return of appeasement, collaboration and
isolationism,\" Feb 18,
tribunecontentagency.com/article/the-return-of-appeasement-collaboration-and-isolationism/

By the start of the Great Depression in 1929, America was mostly unarmed
and determined never to get involved in European feuding again. Most
Americans complained that the huge death toll of World War I had led to
neither perpetual peace nor even a peaceful Germany. [America's
isolationism and disarmament also helped prompt another global war. Had
the U.S. kept its military strong after World War]{.underline} I, and
had it entered into a formal alliance with its former World War I
partners, [Germany never would have risked a second war]{.underline}
against the combined strength of a fully armed Britain, France and
United States. Instead, Hitler assumed the U.S. either could not or
would not offer much military help to his intended European targets.
Why, then, did a relatively weak Nazi Germany between 1939 and 1941
believe that it could take on much of the world, and inspire Axis
partners such as Italy and Japan to follow its suicidal lead? The answer
is obvious. British and French appeasement, Soviet collaboration and
American isolation had together convinced Hitler and his Axis allies
that the victors of World War I were more eager to grant concessions at
any cost than were the defeated. [The world of 2016 is eerily beginning
to resemble the powder keg of 1939 Europe. Iran, China and North Korea,
along with radical Islamic terrorist groups,]{.underline} all [have
particular contempt for Western democracies.]{.underline} Almost daily,
various aggressive nations or [organizations seek provocation by
shooting off intercontinental missiles, boarding American boats, sending
millions of young male Middle Easterners into the West, and issuing
unending threats]{.underline}. China is creating new artificial islands
to control commercial routes to and from Asia. The European Union is
largely unarmed. Yet it still trusts that it can use its vaunted \"smart
diplomacy\" to reason with its enemies. Meanwhile, Vladimir [Putin's
Russia cuts deals with Iran, Syria and most of the enemies of the
West.]{.underline} Like Stalin before, [Putin cynically assumes that his
triangulations will turn aggressive powers exclusively against the
West]{.underline}. Recently, [he warned the West of a \"new world war\"
starting in the Middle East. America is slowly withdrawing from
involvement abroad]{.underline}, using the same isolationist arguments
heard in the 1920s. Past interventions in the Middle East have worn on
the nation. Ingrate nations did not appreciate American sacrifices. In
tough economic times, some contend that defense spending should be
diverted to more social programs. [Appeasement, collaboration and
isolationism always prove a lethal mix --- past and
present]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Europe

#### Retreat now is a victory for Putin, he'll escalate in the future. 

**Economist \'4/2** \[\"Why Ukraine Must Win,\"
economist.com/leaders/2022/04/02/why-ukraine-must-win\]

The other worry is Mr Macron's: that NATO will provoke Russia. From the
start of this war, when he spoke of "consequences...such as you have
never seen in your entire history", Mr Putin has hinted that Western
involvement could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. Wisely, the [West
has therefore been clear that NATO will not fight against Russian
forces---]{.underline}because, if they did, the war could spin out of
control, with catastrophic results.

Yet [backing away from Mr Putin's nuclear-tinged threat entails
risks,]{.underline} too[. Limiting Ukrainian aid would abet Russia in
imposing an unstable]{.underline}---and hence temporary---[peace on Mr
Zelensky]{.underline}. **[It would reward Mr Putin for his
threats]{.underline}**, setting up his next act of atomic aggression. By
contrast, more powerful weapons and sanctions would mark a change in the
degree of aid, but not its kind. And this week, [facing Ukrainian
success, Russia paused the campaign in the north, rather than
escalate]{.underline}. For all those reasons, [the best deterrence is
for NATO to stand up to Mr Putin's veiled threat, and make clear that a
nuclear or chemical atrocity would lead to Russia's utter
isolation.]{.underline}

Josh, \"Is Russia supporting Hezbollah,\" Feb 8,
intersectionproject.eu/article/russia-world/russia-supporting-hezbollah

Adding a further degree of uncertainty to the story, neither the Israeli
or Russian governments have acknowledged the report yet. This is not
surprising, for a [direct Russia-Hezbollah relationship could lead to
any number of dangerous scenarios that might spiral out of
control.]{.underline} For example, what happens [if Israel strikes
Russian arms shipments to Hezbollah and Russian troops are killed in the
process?]{.underline} Alternatively, [what if Russia defends an arms
transfer to Hezbollah by shooting down an Israeli jet with one of its
S-400 missiles]{.underline} recently deployed to Syria? [Either one of
these scenarios could lead to a rapid escalation that would draw the
United States]{.underline} --- still Israel's closest ally despite the
longstanding tensions between Netanyahu and Obama --- [into the
fray.]{.underline} However, even if one of these worst case scenarios
does not come to pass, at a minimum, [Israel's freedom for maneuver in
Syria is diminished by the Russian presence.]{.underline} Whereas
previously Israel owned the skies over Syria, the [Israeli air force
must now coordinate its activities with the Russians to avoid accidental
clashes.]{.underline} Moreover, according to a report co-authored by
Israeli Brig. Gen. Muni Katz and Nadav Pollak for the Washington
Institute, simply working alongside the Russians will significantly
upgrade Hezbollah's military capabilities. ["Hezbollah will be exposed
to Russian military thought, which entails sophisticated operational
concepts and advanced military planning skills,"]{.underline} the report
notes, [including "how to organize an effective command-and-control
structure, how to choose different weapons for different scenarios, how
to create additional targets after entering a battlefield, and how to
maintain logistical routes."]{.underline} The authors argue this will
enhance Hezbollah's offensive warfare and urban capabilities, which
better positions the group to make good on Nasrallah's pledge to launch
strikes into northern Israel's Galilee region in the next war.
[Hezbollah can also watch the weapons systems the Russians use,
and]{.underline} according to the report, "[can learn how to use its
existing weapons more effectively, and examine systems it might want to
procure in the future."]{.underline}

### 1AR -- Russian Expansion Impact

#### Russian aggression causes extinction

**Shirreff 2016** - senior British army officer and former deputy
supreme allied commander Europe\
Richard, \"Putin\'s aggression in Europe should worry the US,\" Oct 21,
www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/opinions/russia-aggression-nato-shirreff-opinion/

Since the formation of NATO in 1949 the defense of Europe and the free
world has depended on the absolute certainty that whatever president is
occupying the White House, the United States will come to the aid of a
NATO member if attacked. Any doubt about the American commitment, and
the credibility of NATO\'s doctrine of collective defense, is holed
below the waterline. [At a time when the West faces a greater threat
from a resurgent Russia]{.underline} since the most dangerous crises of
the Cold War, [NATO,]{.underline} more than ever, [needs to stand
strong, united and credible. Russia\'s invasion of Crimea]{.underline}
and Ukraine in 2014 [may have already lit the fuse that could lead to
the unthinkable: nuclear war with Russia in Europe]{.underline}.
Consider the words and actions of President Vladimir Putin, who has
described the breakup of the Soviet Union as the \"greatest
geo-strategic tragedy of the 20th century.\" In his speech on March 18,
2014, the day Crimea was admitted into the Russian Federation, Putin
majored on the threat the West posed to Russia by its continued
encirclement and warned about the possibility of pushback: \"If you
compress the spring to its limit, it will snap back hard: something you
should remember,\" while claiming the right to protect the interests of
Russian speakers everywhere, \"even if it will worsen our relations with
some states.\" Overnight, Putin became NATO\'s strategic adversary,
starting a dynamic that could lead to a clash with NATO over the Baltic
states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia (which have significant
Russian-speaking minorities). Two years on and the threat is even
greater. Indeed, the ratchet of tension clicks tighter on an almost
weekly basis: Even this week we wake up to news of Russia sailing
warships near the British coast in \"a show of force and a show of
capabilities,\" according to Peter Felstead, editor of Jane\'s Defence
Weekly. Unprecedented levels of military activity on the borders and in
the airspace of the Baltic states, Finland and Sweden have been matched
by the rapid buildup of military forces in Russia\'s Western Military
District on the borders of NATO. For example, in January, Russia
announced the formation and deployment of three motor rifle divisions,
about 60,000 troops, along the Russian frontier with the Baltic states.
And the Russians have kept themselves busy with regular so-called snap
exercises to test the readiness of their military, at least one of which
was based on a scenario of invasion and occupation of the Baltic states.
Putin\'s strategic aim is clear: to re-establish Russia\'s status as one
of the world\'s great powers and to dominate the former republics of the
Soviet Union \-- imperialist intentions that might have been acceptable
to great powers in the 19th century but which are an affront in 2016. If
the opportunity presents itself, he may well activate long-held plans to
march into the Baltic states. To paraphrase British Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain\'s 1938 comment on Czechoslovakia, why are events in
these faraway countries of which we may know little important to
Americans? First, because [if Russia puts one soldier across the borders
of the Baltic states it means war with NATO]{.underline}. Latvia,
Estonia and Lithuania have been members of NATO since 2004 and are
therefore protected under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, the
founding document of NATO, which states that an attack on one is an
attack on all. [A Russian attack on the Baltic states puts America at
war with Russia \-- meaning nuclear war, because Russia integrates
nuclear weapons into every aspect of its military doctrine]{.underline}.
And don\'t think Russia would limit itself to the use of tactical
nuclear weapons in Europe. [Any form of nuclear release by the Russians
would almost certainly precipitate nuclear retaliation by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [and **the dreadful reality of
mutually assured destruction and the end of life as we know it** would
follow]{.underline}. Indeed[, Russia is at war with America already.
Russian hacking of Democratic Party email servers and]{.underline}, if
confirmed, [WikiLeaks publicizing of Clinton campaign emails to
discredit the Democrats and propel]{.underline} Donald
[Trump]{.underline} \-- arguably what Putin would classify as a \"useful
idiot\" into the White House \-- [is classic maskirovka]{.underline} \--
deception, aimed at undermining the intelligence and integrity of the
enemy in a way that remains below the threshold of conventional warfare.
In the words of Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Center, and a man
with close connections to the Putin regime, the Kremlin has been at war
since 2014. But **[although the clock may be ticking close to midnight,
it is not too late.]{.underline}** Maintenance of the peace we have
enjoyed in Western Europe for nearly 70 years depends on effective
deterrence. The bar of risk must be raised too high for Russia to
consider any opportunistic move into the Baltic states. This requires
forward basing of a credible military capability in the Baltic states
and eastern Poland (rather than the token presence agreed at the NATO
Warsaw Summit in July). NATO reserves able to move quickly and
effectively to bolster defenses in the Baltics will send a powerful
message. It also requires Canada and European members of NATO to
recognize that military capabilities lost from cumulative disarmament
over the past two decades must be regenerated. This means increasing
defense spending, almost certainly above the 2% of gross domestic
product agreed \-- but often not acted upon \-- by NATO members (less
the United States, UK, Estonia and Greece). 2017 is 100th anniversary of
the first occasion the United States intervened in one of Europe\'s
wars. The region\'s security is a matter of American security, and it
means continued and close engagement in Europe and a continuation of the
strong leadership that America has given NATO from the start.

### AT: Encirclement 

#### Russian aggression is [pre-emptive]{.underline}\-\--not caused by the US

**Murray 15** -- Professor of Political Science @ Alberta

(Robert, "Time for a New Western Strategy in Ukraine,"
http://www.e-ir.info/2015/02/10/time-for-a-new-western-strategy-in-ukraine/)

[The debate of whether or not to arm Ukraine seems to be transcending
the prototypical liberal-conservative divide]{.underline}, with voices
like realist international politics scholars John Mearsheimer and
Stephen Walt joining the chorus of others who see arming Ukraine as an
unnecessary escalation.

[The problem with the logic]{.underline} presented by Mearsheimer, Walt
and others [is twofold. First, opponents]{.underline} to arming Ukraine
still [believe a diplomatic solution is likely to occur which would be
an optimal outcome]{.underline} rather than risking escalation by
providing arms to Ukraine which would, invariably, lead to more
violence. [There is no question diplomacy would be ideal but there is
**no indication** that Russia is interested and until Russia is forced
to believe they may not keep getting what they want, they will resist
any attempts to negotiate an end to what Putin sees as a welcome and
necessary conflict. Second, there seems to be an unusual narrative
that]{.underline} has emerged where observers like Mearsheimer and Walt
[see Russia as having been backed into a corner]{.underline} due to EU
and NATO expansion, [and are framing ongoing events]{.underline} in
Ukraine [as a response to western expansionism]{.underline}. **[Framing
Russia as responding to, rather than initiating, aggression excuses
Russia's behaviour and bizarrely victimizes Russia in the
situation]{.underline}**. [Even if the logic]{.underline} that Russia
felt backed into a corner due to NATO and EU expansionism [held
validity, it would be limited to an argument about Crimea as a Russian
strategic asset and not Eastern Ukraine]{.underline}.∂ There has also
recently been talk of using peacekeepers from either the UN or the OSCE
as a means of halting violence and allowing time for a diplomatic
solution to be sought. The risk here for western states is that by
inserting peacekeepers, western leaders would accept an legitimize the
Russian gains to date as it would be highly unlikely that negotiations
initiated by peacekeeping would see Russia accept any territorial loss.∂
All of this is not to say that arming Ukraine is a good idea. By arming
the Ukrainians, the west actually sacrifices even more control of the
situation and places its trust in a regime that has proven it may not
always heed the advice of its western friends. Further, the extent to
which the Ukrainians would have to be armed to pose any significant
challenge to the Russians would be so extreme that the success of such a
strategy is highly questionable.∂ So where does this leave the west in
its options moving forward? The Germans insist diplomacy is still the
way to go, a message Merkel preached in both Washington and Ottawa
yesterday. The doctrine of "strategic patience" only reminds both Putin
and the United States' western allies that the Obama Administration is
not going to do much of anything except keep hoping for sanctions to
work while using strong rhetoric that fools no one.∂ At some point we
need to think seriously about what a reasonable end to the conflict
would be. It is incredibly unlikely that Crimea and Eastern Ukraine will
return to Kiev's control, and thus any efforts to find a diplomatic
solution should be predicated on partitioning Ukraine but also
containing Russia from further advances. Containment, however, is not
simply an abstract academic theory where states hope Russia will not
expand. [In order for containment to work, Russia needs to know and
believe that western states are willing and able to go all in if Putin
contemplates upping the ante]{.underline}.∂ [**Without a healthy dose of
deterrence** to complement so-called diplomatic efforts, we are
**doomed** to see more of the same in Eastern Europe]{.underline}.

#### Encirclement didn't cause annexation\-\--this is ahistorical and an excuse for brutal Russian aggression 

**Kirchik 14** -- Fellow at Foreign Policy Initiative

(James, "NATO Expansion Didn't Set Off the Ukraine Crisis" Foreign
Policy,
<http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/04/08/nato_expansion_didnt_set_off_the_ukrainian_crisis>)

NATO [**Expansion Didn\'t Set Off the Ukrainian Crisis** Russia hasn\'t
been \"encircled\" by the West]{.underline} \-- Vladimir [Putin simply
wants to be able to invade his neighbors at will]{.underline}.
[Russia\'s invasion and annexation of Crimea has produced a great deal
of handwringing in the West, with much of the ire directed at
NATO]{.underline}. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\'s slow,
15-year process of expansion into the former Warsaw Pact nations,
critics allege, sparked a tragic, three-stage process: It humiliated
Russia, led to the country\'s encirclement, and provoked its aggressive
behavior toward neighbors. NATO, they say, is a relic of the Cold War,
serving no purpose other than to antagonize America\'s potential
partners in the Kremlin. [Blaming]{.underline} [NATO\'s]{.underline}
[enlargement for Russian belligerence has been a feature of European
security debates]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War, [and a
reliable excuse for explaining away every disagreement between Moscow
and the West]{.underline}. \"Wasn\'t consolidating a democratic Russia
more important than bringing the Czech Navy into NATO?\" New York Times
columnist Tom Friedman scoffed after Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, in
a column aptly entitled, \"What did we expect?\" Returning to this
complaint after last month\'s invasion of Ukraine, Friedman declared
that NATO expansion \"remains one of the dumbest things we\'ve ever done
and, of course, laid the groundwork for Putin\'s rise.\" Fellow New York
Times columnist Ross Douthat derided NATO expansion as a
\"neoconservative\" project (pursued, oddly enough, by Bill Clinton)
\"to effectively encircle\" Russia. And no less a figure than the late
George F. Kennan concluded that \"expanding NATO would be the most
fateful error of American policy in the post cold-war era.\" [Tempting
as it may be]{.underline} to castigate NATO for the deterioration of
relations with Russia, **[nothing could be further from the
truth]{.underline}**: [It]{.underline} was, and [remains, the Russian
regime\'s ideology, rhetoric, and conduct that provided the impulse for
NATO expansion, not the other way around.]{.underline} Far from
representing a historic error, the [enlargement]{.underline} of NATO
into Central and Eastern Europe [has been one of the few unmitigated
success stories of American foreign policy, as it consolidated democracy
and security on a continent once scarred by total war]{.underline}.
[Faulting NATO for Russia\'s bad behavior betrays a fundamental
misunderstanding of post-Cold War European politics]{.underline},
[misrepresents the organization\'s role as a defensive alliance, and
**confuses aggressor with victim.**]{.underline} First, [a little
history is in order.]{.underline} Russia\'s [hostile actions towards
neighbors hardly ended with the collapse of Soviet]{.underline}
[communism]{.underline}. On the contrary, [Moscow continued to bully its
former republics and satellites]{.underline} throughout the early and
mid 1990s, even [before the first round of NATO enlargement]{.underline}
(to the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland in 1999). In 1992 and 1993
\-- [after Russia formally recognized the independence of Estonia,
Latvia, and Lithuania \-- Moscow cut off energy supplies to these small,
reborn democracies in an attempt to pressure them into keeping Russian
military forces and intelligence officers on their sovereign
territory.]{.underline} From 1997 to 2000, according to former U.S.
Ambassador to Lithuania Keith C. Smith, [Russia halted oil shipments to
the country no less than nine times after it refused to sell refineries
to a Russian state company]{.underline}. To this day, [the Russian
Foreign Ministry maintains that the Baltic republics \-- which Russia
militarily conquered, occupied, and subjugated for nearly five decades
\-- \"voluntarily joined the Soviet Union]{.underline} in 1940.\" The
[Balts didn\'t become part of NATO until 2004. Given this history, is it
any wonder why these countries]{.underline} \-- [or any other country
victimized by Soviet-imposed tyranny \-- would want to join the
alliance? Is it NATO\'s fault for saying OK?]{.underline} Critics of
NATO expansion like to point out that, in exchange for earning Soviet
acceptance of German unification, the United States and its allies
promised not to expand the Atlantic alliance. [This is a myth, stemming
from a selective Russian interpretation of]{.underline} the
[diplomacy]{.underline} at the tail end of the Cold War. In February of
1990, with hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops still stationed in
East Germany, then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his foreign
minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, traveled to Moscow to meet with former
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. A day earlier, President George H.W.
Bush had sent Kohl a letter suggesting that East German territory be
given a \"special military status\" \-- the specifics of which would be
determined later \-- within NATO, implying that the alliance would
indeed continue to expand. Hoping to earn speedy Soviet authorization
for the removal of their troops and the unification of Germany, however,
Genscher told Gorbachev that, \"NATO will not expand itself to the
East.\" But the Germans were not speaking for Washington, never mind the
NATO alliance. Furthermore, as historian Mary Elise Sarotte has pointed
out, Genscher\'s concession was never made in writing, and nor did
Gorbachev \"criticize Mr. Kohl publicly when he and Mr. Bush later
agreed to offer only a special military status to the former East
Germany instead of a pledge that NATO wouldn\'t expand.\" Ultimately, a
legally binding agreement not to expand NATO beyond its pre-1990 borders
never materialized, and [Russia\'s]{.underline} latter-day [claim that
it was deceived by the West has no basis in fact. **Russia\'s cries of
Western betrayal are really just a smokescreen**]{.underline}. Far from
threatening Russia, [NATO has repeatedly gone out of its way to be
conciliatory.]{.underline} A 1997 agreement outlining relations between
the two former adversaries stipulated that the NATO states had \"no
intention, no plan, and no reason\" to deploy nuclear weapons on the
territory of its new members. These \"three no\'s\" were intended as an
expression of goodwill and a reaffirmation of NATO\'s founding
principle: that it is a defensive alliance with no designs on Russian
territory. In the spirit of transparency, the organization founded the
NATO-Russia Council in 2002 to facilitate cooperation between Moscow and
member states. [Not only did Western leaders repeatedly and explicitly
make clear that NATO posed no threat whatsoever to Russia\'s security,
some even suggested that Russia ultimately join the]{.underline} very
military [alliance]{.underline} that had been established to contain it
during the Cold War. \"We need Russia for the resolution of European and
global problems,\" Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said in 2009.
\"That is why I think it would be good for Russia to join NATO.\" This
hardly constitutes \"cram\[ming\] NATO expansion down the Russians\'
throats,\" as Friedman alleges. Regardless, Sikorski was rebuked
immediately by then-Russian envoy to NATO and now Deputy Prime Minister
Dmitry Rogozin, who retorted that \"Great powers don\'t join coalitions,
they create coalitions. Russia considers itself a great power\...For the
moment, we don\'t see any real change in the organization, we only see
the organization getting ready for the wars of past Europe.\" [With its
invasion of Crimea]{.underline}, the first forcible annexation of
European territory since World War II, [it is Russia, and not NATO, that
has returned the continent to \"the wars of past Europe]{.underline}.\"
[More significant,]{.underline} however, [was what this terse exchange
revealed about the debate over NATO expansion: It has never really been
about the enlargement of a defensive military alliance, but **rather the
nature of the Russian regime itself**.]{.underline} [If Russia
had]{.underline} followed a democratic path (like the former communist
states which joined NATO) and [ceased posing a threat to its neighbors,
there would have been nothing preventing it from becoming a]{.underline}
suitable [candidate for membership]{.underline}. After all, if the
foreign minister of Poland, a nation historically terrorized by Russia
and which is once again rearming itself in light of Crimea, proposed
that Russia join NATO, who could possibly oppose it? As Swedish Foreign
Minister Carl Bildt aptly pointed out on Twitter recently, it was the
\"historic failure of Russia that a quarter of a century after fall of
Soviet Union the new generations in its neighbors see it as an enemy,\"
while, in contrast, \"A generation or two after 1945 Germany is
surrounded by countries that, after all the horrible pain and suffering,
see it as a friend.\" [Russia\'s hostility]{.underline} to NATO
enlargement [stems from the]{.underline} same [root as all of its
conflicts with the West: **the zero-sum worldview and neo-imperialist
agenda** of]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}. . In
2005, [he declared the breakup of the Soviet Union to be \"a major
geopolitical disaster of the 20th century]{.underline}.\" And [if there
was any remaining doubt that he intends to reconstitute the empire,
Putin erased it with]{.underline} [his]{.underline} furious March 18
[speech]{.underline} to Russia\'s Federation Council [in which he
essentially reserved the right to invade and annex any territory where
ethnic Russians claim to feel oppressed]{.underline}. To [say that NATO
expansion \"laid the groundwork for Putin\'s rise,\"]{.underline} as
Friedman does, [gets the situation exactly backwards. Putin\'s ascent
was almost entirely the product of domestic factors]{.underline},
namely, the economic chaos of the 1990s [and the popular desire for a
firm response to the insurgency in Chechnya]{.underline}. [NATO
expansion barely registered on the minds of ordinary
Russians.]{.underline} With Russia amassing tens of thousands of troops
on Ukraine\'s eastern border and stoking ethnic conflict in the hopes of
providing a pretext for gobbling up even more territory, [lending
credence to Moscow\'s complaints about NATO expansion is
**intellectually irresponsible and geopolitically
dangerous.**]{.underline} In the midst of negotiations to deescalate the
crisis, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei [Lavrov has demanded that
Ukraine essentially dismember itself into autonomous
regions]{.underline} (the easier for Russia to meddle in the country\'s
eastern provinces, which are heavily populated with ethnic Russians)
[and \"firm guarantees]{.underline}\" forswearing NATO and EU
membership. [Given that Russia has already invaded and annexed Ukrainian
territory, and that it has shown no sign of discontinuing its aggressive
behavior on the country\'s borders, these ultimatums constitute nothing
less than a threat to use additional force if its demands are not
met.]{.underline} Rather than firmly rebut these outrageous attempts to
violate the sovereignty of an independent country, Secretary of State
John Kerry has stated that Russia has \"legitimate concerns\" in
Ukraine. This despite the fact that [according to a new
poll]{.underline}, 66 percent of ethnic [Russian citizens there feel no
pressure or threat from the new government]{.underline} in Kiev, a
[direct refutation of Moscow\'s relentless propaganda to the contrary.
The assertion by Russia (and its Western apologists) that NATO
constitutes a threat has always been a ruse]{.underline}. As was the
case during the Cold War, it [is Russia that threatens its neighbors
today, not vice-versa.]{.underline} [Russia\'s real reason for opposing
NATO expansion,]{.underline} as one Ukrainian Foreign Ministry official
told me in Kiev last month, is [that the alliance\'s collective security
provision would prevent Moscow from invading its neighbors, something
that Russia has done twice in the last six years]{.underline}. It is for
this reason that **[NATO \-- and its expansion \-- remains vital for
European security and stability.]{.underline}** To appreciate the
hypocrisy of faulting NATO enlargement for the present predicament, one
need only consider the claim that the military alliance has
\"encircled\" Russia. [There is only one country in Europe being
encircled right now \-- and it isn\'t Russia.]{.underline}

WASHINGTON - [After two years under rhetorical assault from]{.underline}
U.S. President Donald [Trump, America's alliances have **somehow held
up.**]{.underline} [This year]{.underline}, however, [the
**constraints** on Trump's anti-alliance instincts are **falling
away**]{.underline}, and [a mix of internal and external pressures are
endangering several **key alliances**]{.underline} at once.

[This trend is most visible with respect to NATO]{.underline}. The
trans-Atlantic alliance has been a target of Trump's ire for decades.
Since taking office, [he has berated European leaders]{.underline},
[waffled on]{.underline} America's [Article 5]{.underline} commitment to
protect allies, [and]{.underline} even [mused about
withdrawing]{.underline} from the pact. [Yet]{.underline} for two years,
largely [thanks to the initiative of Congress and the
Pentagon]{.underline}, [day-to-day relations]{.underline} with NATO
**[remained relatively steady]{.underline}**. [The administration
increased spending]{.underline} on military activities meant to deter
Russian aggression. [The alliance]{.underline} also [took steps
to]{.underline} **[improve its military readiness]{.underline}** [and
address]{.underline} unconventional threats such as [cyberattacks and
information warfare]{.underline}.

[This progress]{.underline}, however, [was]{.underline} largely
[dependent on]{.underline} the presence of committed, **[pro-NATO
officials]{.underline}** in the American bureaucracy. [Those officials
are **becoming scarcer by the day**]{.underline}. Secretary of Defense
James **[Mattis is gone]{.underline}**, replaced by an acting secretary
--- Patrick [Shanahan]{.underline} --- who [seems more inclined to
**fulfill the president's wishes**]{.underline}. National Security
Adviser John [Bolton and]{.underline} Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo
are not anti-NATO]{.underline}, [but their hostility to the European
Union **poisons** their relationships with European
colleagues]{.underline}. Less visibly, several key Pentagon and State
Department officials responsible for the NATO portfolio --- Assistant
Secretary of Defense Robert **[Karem]{.underline}**, Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense Thomas **[Goffus]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
Assistant Secretary of State Wess **[Mitchell]{.underline}** --- [have
**left or will soon leave** their posts.]{.underline}

None of this means that Trump is likely to withdraw from NATO.
Bipartisan support for a recent House resolution that seeks to prevent
Trump from unilaterally pulling out of that alliance is a clear warning
of the political price he would pay for doing so. [The most likely
scenario is]{.underline} that there will simply be [less constructive
leadership]{.underline} from Washington --- [less ability to **propose
new initiatives** or even **respond to allies' ideas**]{.underline} ---
[at a time when NATO confronts major challenges from Russia and
illiberalism]{.underline} is surging within the alliance.

Things are no better on the other side of the world. The Japan-U.S.
alliance has come through the first half of Trump's term in stronger
shape than one might have expected, given the president's three-decade
history of Japan-bashing. Yet the strains are subtly mounting. Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe's assiduous personal cultivation of Trump did not
prevent the president from peremptorily withdrawing from the
Trans-Pacific Partnership in his first week in office. Now, Abe fears
that Trump may cut a grand bargain with China at Japan's expense, or
make a deal with North Korea that similarly ignores Tokyo's security
concerns. And while the challenges in the Japan-U.S. alliance are merely
simmering, the problems may be coming to a boil in two other alliances.

The U.S.-South Korea alliance is in crisis, as negotiations on the
amount Seoul pays to defray the costs of the American troop presence
have deadlocked. According to South Korean officials, U.S. negotiators
asked for a dramatic hike in these payments, casting doubt on whether
Washington was dealing in good faith. The fact that the U.S. side has
asked for annual renegotiations --- as opposed to a multi-year agreement
--- has heightened concerns that Trump will simply ask for more again
next year.

The resulting impasse may lead the Pentagon to stop paying South Korean
contractors starting in the spring. It could also give an American
president who has never liked the U.S. presence on the Korean Peninsula
an excuse to begin reducing that presence. Last year, Congress passed
legislation prohibiting the Pentagon from cutting U.S. troop levels in
South Korea below 22,000 (from the current 28,000). That prohibition can
be circumvented, however, if the secretary of defense certifies that
doing so is in the national interest.

Making the future of the alliance even more precarious is that this
internal dispute is happening at a critical stage in U.S.-North Korea
diplomacy. As the upcoming summit with Kim Jong Un approaches, Trump
will surely be tempted to make a big concession that will jump-start
moribund negotiations on North Korean missiles and nukes. Given how
little he cares for the U.S. troop presence in the first place --- and
given that he suspended U.S.-South Korean military exercises after his
previous summit with Kim --- the president may try to kill two birds
with one stone. He could withdraw some U.S. forces as a way of appeasing
Kim and punishing the South Koreans for not paying up. Doing so would be
a gift to Pyongyang, Moscow and Beijing: It would be a big step toward
undermining the alliance with Seoul and America's position in Northeast
Asia.

Finally, America's most important alliance in Southeast Asia is also
entering a danger zone. For years, the U.S. has refused to clarify
whether the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines covers the
islands and reefs that Manila controls in the South China Sea. That
ambiguity is meant to avoid writing a "blank check" that Manila might
cash by provoking China. Yet given how rapidly China's expansionism is
shifting the balance of influence in the region, ambiguity is rapidly
becoming untenable.

Since 2012, when the U.S. failed to prevent Beijing from seizing control
of Scarborough Shoal, Filipino officials have worried that Washington
cannot deter the Chinese salami-slicing that is paring away their
country's sovereignty. Making matters worse, the U.S. has formally
clarified its commitment to defending the Japanese-administered Senkaku
Islands in the East China Sea, while evading questions about whether it
has a parallel commitment to the Philippines. Further fueling the crisis
is the fact that the Philippines now have a president --- Rodrigo
Duterte --- who is openly skeptical of the value the U.S. defense
commitment provides.

As a result of all this, Philippines Secretary of National Defense
Delfin Lorenzana has been signaling that Manila may re-evaluate its
commitment to the Mutual Defense Treaty if Washington doesn't clarify
its position. Yet the Trump administration has so far been silent,
perhaps because American officials sense that this issue will be a loser
with a president who sees alliances as burdens.

A position of continued American ambiguity will probably not lead
Duterte to pull out of the alliance. But it may reinforce his belief
that Chinese power will ultimately dominate Southeast Asia, and that
Manila should accommodate rather than resist the inevitable. That, in
turn, would make it far harder for the U.S. to rally the region against
Chinese revisionism; it would subtly but unmistakably erode America's
position in Southeast Asia.

To be fair, the crisis of this particular alliance is not really Trump's
fault. Reassuring an exposed ally --- while also restraining that ally
from unwise actions --- would test the abilities of even a competent,
committed administration. Yet the chances that things could turn out
badly, with the Philippines or any of these allies, are only heightened
by the fact that America currently has a hollowed-out administration led
by this particular president.

Since Trump took office[, U.S. foreign policy wonks have worried that
his presidency would be a period of grave peril for America's
alliances]{.underline}. **[This might be the year that proves them
right]{.underline}**.

#### Spending sufficient now -- coerced, rapid increases in spending fail

**Horn and Eloranta 2018**

Heather Souvaine Horn global affairs editor at The New Republic,
interviewing Jari Eloranta, an economic historian at Appalachian State
University who specializes in military spending July 12, 2018 "Is It
Fair for Trump to Bash NATO Over Military Spending?"
https://newrepublic.com/article/149819/fair-trump-bash-nato-military-spending

[To what extent has the president pointed to a real
problem]{.underline}?

**[It's very artificial]{.underline}** to point at the 2 percent target.
The financial crisis and downturn after 2008 was much more severe in
Europe---it has taken them much longer to recover from it. It's kind of
artificial to use GDP as the measuring stick for military spending at
all. Because obviously if your GDP declines, typically budgetary
spending doesn't change that much for a while, so, for example, states
like Greece look like they're spending almost 3 percent of their GDP on
defense when in fact it's just an artifact of their GDP having plummeted
massively.

Same thing for the U.S.: Right after 2008 U.S. military spending as a
percentage of GDP jumps from a little over 3 percent to a little over 4
percent, so it looks like Obama increased military spending when he
didn't. Often budgets are immobile and you can't change them as quickly.
So right now because U.S. economic growth has been so strong, it looks
like from 2010 U.S. military spending as a percentage of GDP has dropped
from a little over 4 percent to a little over 3 percent. And, in fact,
in recent years it looks as if European military spending as a
percentage GDP has been declining, but mostly that's because of the late
recovery that started in 2013 and 2014, when a lot of their economies
started to rebound.

To what extent, then, was this current conflict within NATO a matter of
long-term trends?

I think this is absolutely a longer trend. Military spending obviously
is always driven by economic development. When countries become more
developed they are able to dedicate less money for defense respective of
GDP because if your GDP doubles and you maintain 1.5 percent level of
GDP on military spending that still means a huge increase in military
spending. And there are also fewer conflicts in the world and less sort
of external violence and need for defense: Ever since the end of the
Cold War there's been less need of unified-alliance defensive efforts.

In recent years in Europe, of course, the Russian aggression in Crimea
and Ukraine has been a huge worry, and has led to an increase in
military spending in the Baltic and Eastern European countries. Military
spending is always driven by threats as well, and some European
countries don't feel the threat as acutely as others.

In general, the Trump administration's, or **[Trump's, efforts are very
disingenuous]{.underline}**, [because European countries already agreed
in 2014]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [start increasing their military
spending]{.underline}. [This was a whole NATO-wide effort projected to
last until 2024]{.underline}, and [it's in response not to U.S. needs
but to **increased threats from Russia**]{.underline}, and trying to
create more unity within the alliance.

What about Germany's difficulties meeting its targets, with Merkel
recently downgrading expectations about when the country is going to
reach two percent spending?

Well, typically I'd say [it's very much a positive thing that a country
takes care in terms of planning military spending increases very
carefully and slowly]{.underline}. [When you rapidly increase military
spending, that creates opportunities for waste, for rent-seeking, for
companies to take advantage of opportunities that are not
well-thought-out---opportunities for defense contractors to make a quick
buck]{.underline}.

[All]{.underline} these [spending increases are always slow
anyway]{.underline}, [because governments have other budgetary
concerns]{.underline}. For Europe as a whole, and particularly Germany,
[the big policy problem right now is the refugees and
immigration]{.underline}, which is creating a huge deal of tension
within the Merkel administration---that's their priority. So I'm not
surprised at all that this is not one of their pressing concerns right
now and they don't quite necessarily see Russian threat as an acute one
that they would require massive quick spending increases. Whether
they'll meet those targets or not, that's somewhat arbitrary, because if
the German economy increases rapidly they'd have to ramp up spending
even faster to meet that target. So that's a mechanism that's difficult
to predict overall.

### 2AC -- Catchall 

#### American leadership in NATO solves their impacts

**Burns 2018** - former under secretary of state and ambassador to NATO,
teaches diplomacy and international relations at Harvard\
Nicholas, \"What America Gets out of NATO,\" Jul 11,
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/opinion/what-america-gets-out-of-nato.html

Third, future [American leaders will find Europe is our most capable and
willing partner in tackling the biggest threats to global security:
climate change; drugand cybercrime cartels; terrorism;
pandemics]{.underline} and mass migration from Africa and the Middle
East. And America's [NATO allies will continue to be
indispensable]{.underline} in safeguarding democracy and freedom, under
assault by Russia and China.

Mr. Trump's campaign to undermine the European Union and diminish
America's leadership in NATO serves none of these interests. He seems
driven by resentment about European trade surpluses and low defense
budgets, issues that blind him to all the other benefits Americans
derive from our alliance with Europe and Canada.

Mr. Trump may believe his blistering attacks on Europe's trade policies
and defense budgets are a good negotiating tactic before the summit. But
in fact they have already done enormous damage. While he cannot outright
kill NATO --- the American public and Congress support it too strongly
--- he has eroded significant levels of trust and good will. As it
became clear during my recent visits across Europe, a dangerous breach
has opened in the trans-Atlantic alliance --- by far the worst in seven
decades.

Mr. Trump wants Americans to believe that their allies are simply taking
advantage of them. On Sept. 11, 2001, I witnessed a far different
reality as American ambassador to NATO. Canada and the European allies
volunteered within hours of the attacks to invoke Article 5 of the NATO
treaty, which compels all members to respond to an attack on any single
member, for the first time in history. They came to our defense when we
most needed them. They sent troops to fight with us in Afghanistan. They
are still there with us 17 years later.

Are [we now going to throw off that mutual protection, and go it alone
in a dangerous 21st-century world?]{.underline} **[That would be a
historic mistake]{.underline}**. But that is where we may find ourselves
if Mr. Trump's anti-Europe vendetta continues.

what happened without it.," *Politico*,
<https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/15/trump-nato-europe-history-dependence-219011>)

[Trump's NATO-bashing surprised no one]{.underline}. He has repeatedly
suggested the United States' postwar security architecture is a "bad
deal," one negotiated by weak and foolish "incompetents." [Foreign
policy, in his view, is a zero-sum game]{.underline}; any benefit to
another nation must of necessity be a loss for the United States. "NATO
countries," he declared on Twitter, "must pay MORE, the United States
must pay LESS. Very Unfair!" Unfair? A world that revolves around
American military, economic and cultural power, and uses the U.S. dollar
as its reserve currency? [What Trump fails to understand is
that]{.underline} the disparity in spending, with [the U.S. paying more
than its allies, is not a bug of the system. It **is a
feature**]{.underline}. [This is how]{.underline} the
[great]{.underline} postwar [states]{.underline}men [designed it, and
this immensely foresighted strategy has ensured the absence of great
power conflict]{.underline}---[and nuclear war]{.underline}---[for
three-quarters of a century]{.underline}. [The open, liberal world order
we know today]{.underline} was built in the wake of World War II and
expanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By design, it [is led
by the United States; by design, it ensures permanent U.S. military
hegemony over Eurasia while uniting Europe under the U.S.'
protection]{.underline}. The goal of this American grand strategy is to
prevent any single power from dominating the region and turning on the
United States and its allies. [American hegemony serves]{.underline},
too, [to quell previously intractable regional rivalries,
preventing]{.underline} further [world wars]{.underline}. Dean Acheson,
George Marshall and the other great statesmen of their generation
pursued this strategy because they had learned, at unimaginable cost,
that the eternal American fantasy of forever being free of
Europe---isolationism, or America Firstism, in other words---was just
that: a fantasy. Four hundred thousand American men lost their lives in
the European theaters of the First and Second World Wars. (American
fatalities in all of the other 20th-century conflicts---including
Vietnam, Korea and the Persian Gulf---do not total one-quarter of that
number.) Our postwar statesmen were neither weak nor incompetent. They
were the architects of the greatest foreign policy triumph in U.S.
history. [So successful was this policy that Americans
now]{.underline}---most of whom weren't alive to witness the enormity of
these wars---[see peace, unity, prosperity and stability as Europe's
natural state]{.underline}. **[This is an illusion]{.underline}**. For
centuries, Europe was the fulcrum of global violence. With the age of
global exploration, it became the globe's primary exporter of violence,
the tempo and horror of the carnage rising every century with
improvements in technology for violence. The Scramble for Africa, the
division and colonization of that continent by Europe, is a case in
point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa Conference, which assembled the
representatives of 13 European powers to settle their colonial claims to
Africa by diplomacy in place of arms, did lead to peace in Europe for
several years. Africans, however, would not recall these years for their
exceptional comity. For example, the conference indulged King Léopold
II's claim that the Congo Free State was his private property. Ten
million Congolese souls perished under his ministrations. In recognizing
this history of blood, however, we must recognize something equally
true: In the wake of World War II, liberal democracy saw its fullest
realization in the West. This flourishing of peace and human rights
cannot be explained by a sudden outbreak of European pacifism. (Consider
the 1956 Suez expedition, crushed by an infuriated President Dwight
Eisenhower; or the 1954-62 Franco-Algerian War.) It happened because
during World War II, Europe destroyed itself, leaving the United States
overwhelmingly powerful by comparison, its only rival the Soviet Union.
Through the application of economic, diplomatic and military force
majeure, the United States suppressed Europe's internal security
competition. This is why postwar Europe ceased to be the world's leading
exporter of violence and became, instead, the world's leading exporter
of luxury sedans. [Only America, and massive power as the U.S. exercised
it, could have pacified and unified Europe]{.underline} under its aegis.
No other continental country possessed half the world's GDP. No other
country had enough distance from Europe to be trusted, to a large
extent, by all parties and indifferent to its regional jealousies. No
other country had a strategic, moral and economic vision for Europe that
its inhabitants could be persuaded gladly to share. Indeed, Europeans
cooperated with the U.S. program because it created conditions under
which both the United States and Europe flourished. The United States
assisted Europe's postwar economic recovery with \$13 billion of aid in
the form of the Marshall Plan. (In today's dollars, roughly \$113
billion.) It midwifed the groupings and treaties that would become the
European Union. It brought Europe under the U.S. security umbrella with
the NATO treaty. Article V of the treaty, its most important element,
declares that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all
members. These policies were intended not only to counter the Soviet
Union, but to condition Europe's prosperity upon its integration into a
single market, with free movement of goods, capital and labor. The
founders of these institutions fully intended them to be the foundations
of a United States of Europe, much like the United States of America.
Profound economic interdependence, they believed, would make further
European wars impossible. At the same time, [the United States built an
open, global order upon an architecture of specific
institutions]{.underline}: the United Nations, the International
Monetary Fund and the International Court of Justice. [This order is in
many respects an empire]{.underline}---a Pax Americana---[but it is more
humane than any empire that preceded it]{.underline}, with institutions
that are intended to benefit all parties. Postwar U.S. statesmen
believed that prosperous, [liberal democracies that traded
freely]{.underline} with each other would [neither go to war with each
other nor the United States]{.underline}. They ascribed, in other words,
to the so-called Democratic Peace theory---a theory with overwhelming
empirical support. The U.S. military was always an integral part of the
plan to unite and rebuild Europe from the rubble. Since World War II,
U.S. troops have been deployed in Eurasia to ensure the continent cannot
be dominated by a single power capable of monopolizing its resources and
turning them against the U.S. The United States has built overwhelmingly
massive military assets there to deter local arms races before they
begin, and it has simultaneously assured those under U.S. protection
that there is no need to begin local arms races, for their safety is
guaranteed. American grand strategy rests upon the credibility of its
promise to protect American allies; this credibility rests, in turn,
upon U.S. willingness to display its commitment. (The Berlin Airlift,
when U.S. troops airlifted supplies to Berlin during a Soviet blockade,
was precisely such a display.) In return for the United States'
commitment, U.S. allies have accepted America's dominant role in the
international system. In the postwar era, just as now, the enemies of
liberal democracy sought to undermine the order the U.S. was building.
Precisely because the Marshall Plan would strengthen and unite the West
under the United States' protection, the Soviet Union's propaganda
organs cranked into overdrive to denounce it. A cartoon, for example,
published in Isvestia in 1949, depicted the Marshall Plan's
administrator, Paul Hoffman, as a fat capitalist bent on destroying the
sovereignty of European nations. The French paper L\'Humanité, which
reliably parroted Moscow's line, wrote, "After disorganizing the
national economies of the countries which are under the American yoke,
American leaders now intend conclusively to subjugate the economy of
these countries to their own interests." The Soviet Union's criticism of
the Marshall Plan and other American involvement in Europe was eerily
similar to the language Russia's now uses in its campaign to undermine
NATO and the EU. The vocabulary and tropes of Russian propaganda are
widely echoed, wittingly or unwittingly, by far-right, far-left and
other antiliberal politicians, parties and movements throughout the
West. With the men who built the postwar world order now in their
graves, and the memory of carnage and horror buried with them, a very
sizable constituency of Americans has forgotten that their country built
this system for a reason---that [the United States does not maintain its
alliances as an act of foolish largesse]{.underline}. The loudest
exponent of the idea that the U.S. is getting rolled, that the European
Union was "created to destroy us," and that multilateral institutions
such as the World Trade Organization assault the "sovereignty" of the
nations concerned is, unfortunately, the president of the United States.
It's hard to understate how foolish and reckless these notions are.
[History can be shoved down the memory hole, for a time, but reality is
never so cooperative]{.underline}. [Global free trade sustains modern
economic life. An interruption to this trade]{.underline}---carried out
chiefly on global shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S.
military---[would bring modern life to an end]{.underline}. The Second
World War proved not only that isolationism and American-Firstism were
fantasies, but exceptionally childish and dangerous ones, at that. In
the age of hyperglobalized trade, international air travel, the
internet, nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, these
fantasies are even more childish and dangerous. The U.S. may be on
another continent, but it is not on another planet. It is true that the
U.S. spends more on its military, in absolute dollars and as a
percentage of GDP, than any European country. That was always part of
the deal. The U.S. is a global superpower. It can fight a war anywhere
in the world, invade any country at will, and (at least in theory) fight
multiple simultaneous major wars---even in space. Of course this costs
more. It is in America's advantage to be the only power on the planet
that can do this. Conversely, it is not remotely in America's advantage
for other countries to spend as much money on their militaries as we do.
Europe is America's biggest export market, as designed. We want
Europeans to spend their money enjoying U.S. goods and services, not
razing Flanders to the ground yet again. [Yet Trump's refusal
to]{.underline} deter our shared enemies and [protect our allies risks
provoking a regional European **arms race**]{.underline}---exactly what
the U.S. has sought to avoid for 74 years[. It is an invitation to
adventurism from Putin]{.underline}. Trump's refusal to adopt the
encouraging language of past presidents toward European integration,
language that until now has been transformed into policy by professional
and experienced State Department employees, puts further strain on an
already-weakened Europe. Above all, Trump's overt support for sordid,
Kremlin-backed actors who seek to undermine Europe's unity is
unfathomable: How could it be in Europe's interest, or in ours, for the
American president to lend the United States' prestige and support to
Europe's Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal Marxists, populists,
authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists, particularly since all of them
are ideologically hostile to the United States? The damage
[Trump]{.underline} has deliberately inflicted on Europe's stability
[comes at a uniquely dangerous time]{.underline}. Democracy's so-called
third wave---the global blossoming of open political systems after the
Cold War---has long since receded. [A threat to liberal
democracy]{.underline}, in the form of a distinct, rival
ideology---illiberal democracy---[is ascendant]{.underline}. We see it
today in Russia and Turkey---a corrupt, oligarchic, kleptocratic and
hollow form of democracy that spreads and consolidates itself through
the new technologies of the 21st century. The global order the U.S.
built was based on the principle that [only a world of liberal
democracies can be peaceful and prosperous.]{.underline} That principle
is correct. [Should the unraveling of the order the U.S. built
proceed]{.underline} at this pace, [the world will soon be neither
peaceful nor prosperous]{.underline}. [Nor will the effects be confined
to regions distant from the United States. America will feel
them]{.underline} gradually, and then, probably, overnight---[in the
form of a devastating, sudden shock]{.underline}. Charles de Gaulle
believed the Anglophone world could not, in the long term, be trusted
with French security. It led him to withdraw France from NATO's military
integrated command and launch an independent nuclear development
program. The independent nuclear program was real, but the withdrawal
from NATO wasn't---a secret agreement kept France in NATO anyway. But,
today, with other NATO members obliged to consider the costs and
benefits of an independent accommodation with Russia and the risks and
rewards of acquiring an independent nuclear deterrent, de Gaulle is
saying from the grave, I told you so. [The American-led world
order]{.underline}, undergirded by the ideal of liberal democracy, has
been highly imperfect. But it [has been the closest thing to Utopia our
fallen and benighted species has ever seen. Its benefits are not just
economic, although those benefits are immense]{.underline}. [Its
benefits must be measured in wars not fought, lives not
squandered]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline} many [Americans have turned
their backs]{.underline} on history and reality alike. [Let us hope
pride does not prevent them from realizing this mistake before it's far
too late]{.underline}.

refusing to commit to the Baltics **categorically**]{.underline}, [he
encourages Russia to test American resolve in dangerous
ways]{.underline}. [According to]{.underline} some [Russia
experts]{.underline}, Vladimir [Putin's ultimate wish in Europe is to
break NATO. The way to do that, according to these scholars, is to
expose the Article 5 guarantee as hollow: to show that when push comes
to shove, the United States]{.underline} or other large NATO powers
[wouldn't actually defend the weaker states]{.underline}. [The Baltic
states would be the most likely scenario for this to
happen]{.underline}. They are very small, they're right on Russia's
borders, and they aren\'t really all that important to Western
countries\' own security. By threatening these states, Russia would
force a question: Are the United States, Britain, and France really
willing to sacrifice their own soldiers in defense of a tiny state? In
2014, the Danish intelligence agency --- note that Denmark is a NATO
ally --- publicly warned that this was a serious possibility: [Russia
may attempt to test NATO's cohesion]{.underline} by engaging in military
intimidation of the Baltic countries, for instance [with a **threatening
military build-up** close to the borders of these countries and
simultaneous attempts of political **pressure**, destabilization and
possibly **infiltration**]{.underline}. [Russia could launch such an
intimidation campaign]{.underline} in connection with a serious crisis
in the post-Soviet space or another international crisis in which Russia
confronts the United States and NATO. [The critical issue in preventing
this scenario, again, is the **perception of NATO
commitment**]{.underline}. [So long as Putin believes that the US and
other major powers are firmly committed to the defense of their treaty
allies, he's **unlikely to risk starting a war** that he would almost
certainly lose]{.underline}. [This is why Trump's comments are so
damaging: They send a direct signal to the Kremlin that a Trump-led
America will be less than serious about the defense of NATO allies. This
suggests that a ploy to break NATO might have a bigger risk]{.underline}
of succeeding than previously thought. But note that [Trump]{.underline}
also [refused to say unequivocally that he wouldn't abide by the NATO
treaty]{.underline}. "I don't want to tell you what I'd do because I
don't want Putin to know what I'd do," he said. [But the entire point of
NATO is that Putin needs to know what America will do]{.underline}. [If
he knows the US will defend the Baltics, then he will likely back
off.]{.underline} [If he knows the US won't defend the Baltics, then we
could have the breakup of NATO]{.underline} --- which would be quite bad
but wouldn't immediately risk World War III. [The nightmare
scenario]{.underline}, though, [is that Putin's confidence in NATO is
undermined even though the United States under Trump remains committed
to defending its treaty allies]{.underline}. [That's the scenario under
which misperceptions]{.underline} potentially **[escalate into an actual
war between the world's two largest nuclear powers]{.underline}**. Max
Fisher wrote an extended piece on how this uncertainty could plausibly
escalate to war for Vox last year; I encourage you to read it. But the
point, according the experts Fisher spoke to, is that **[a firm
understanding that the US will defend its NATO allies is
crucial]{.underline}**. \"That kind of **[misperception]{.underline}**
situation **[is]{.underline}** definitely possible, and that's **[how
wars start]{.underline}**,\" Steve Saideman, a professor who studies
NATO at Carleton University, told Fisher. He then scarily compared
modern Europe with pre--World War I Europe: \"**[The thing that makes
war most thinkable is when other people don't think it's
thinkable]{.underline}**.\"

#### Specifically, Putin [moves on]{.underline} the Baltics

(Damon, "A Transatlantic Strategy to Deter Putin's Aggression," *US

Regional Security Cooperation*, Lexis)

This crisis began long before Crimea. Indeed, [Russia\'s annexation of
Crimea was the natural outcome of a clear, consistent policy dating back
years]{.underline}. I detail this record in my full testimony. Second,
[Putin will not stop until he encounters serious pushback]{.underline}.
Third, [only the United States can galvanize Europe and the
international community around an effective strategy to deter Putin for
the long term]{.underline}. Fourth, any strategy should urgently and
decisively back Ukraine, as well as other vulnerable states with
significant economic and military assistance in the short term, while
keeping the door open to the European Union or NATO. And fifth, we
should neither abandon the Russian people nor the vision that a
democratic Russia one day can find its peaceful place within a Europe
whole and free. [Putin\'s strategy has been to use this crisis to
consolidate his own hold]{.underline} at home through greater oppression
of civil society and independent media even as he fuels nationalist
fervor. He has created an environment of fear and intimidation fostering
the circumstances that led to the assassination of Boris Nemtsov. Putin,
of course, is also seeking to dominate his neighbors, to drain them of
resources to fuel his kleptocracy, and to restore a sense of Russia\'s
greatness in the only way a bully knows. [He aims to prevent his
neighbors from joining]{.underline} either [NATO]{.underline} or the EU,
[achieving this through coercion when possible and by dismemberment and
occupation when necessary]{.underline}. Ultimately [Putin knows that the
**best check** on his power is a united transatlantic
community]{.underline}, and he has sought to divide Europe, undermining
the resolve for sustained sanctions. [But the **most tempting
objective** for Putin is to call into question the credibility of
NATO\'s Article 5 mutual defense commitment as doing so would
effectively end NATO]{.underline}. [A Russian move against an
ally]{.underline}, such as [**a Baltic State**, cannot be ruled out.
Putin has demonstrated time and again that **if he senses an opportunity
to act he will**]{.underline}, [convinced that the West **lacks the
will** or the ability to take decisive action]{.underline}. That is why
today\'s situation is dangerous. We have seen repeatedly that Putin\'s
objectives expand with success and contract with failure. This means
that **[the best determinant of his action is Western
action]{.underline}**. There is a tendency, however, to argue that the
Europeans should take the lead on Ukraine. After all, we have our hands
full with ISIS and other global responsibilities. But the Ukraine crisis
is a Russia crisis, and Russia is too big, too strong, and too scary for
Europe to resolve this without us. [**Without U.S. leadership**, Europe
may feel forced to accommodate a revanchist Russia, and we have seen
throughout history this is a dangerous formula]{.underline}. [The United
States has the ability to rally its allies and international partners
around a comprehensive strategy that not only deters Putin\'s
aggression, but avoids an unstable gray zone in Europe
East]{.underline}. To do so, we should begin by articulating what we
want to achieve. We should more decisively increase the cost to Russia,
including by enacting sectorial sanctions and targeting Gazprom and
Putin directly.

#### Baltics invasion goes nuclear.

Loren B. **Thompson**, 7-20-20**16** - Chief Operating Officer of the
non-profit Lexington Institute and Chief Executive Officer of Source
Associates, taught at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government.; "Why The Baltic States Are Where Nuclear War Is Most Likely
To Begin,\" *National Interest*,
http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-baltic-states-are-where-nuclear-war-most-likely-17044?page=2

However, the [possibility of **nuclear war** between America and
Russia]{.underline} not only still exists, but [is]{.underline} probably
**[growing]{.underline}**. And [the place]{.underline} where [it is most
likely to begin is]{.underline} in a future [military confrontation
over]{.underline} three small **[Baltic states]{.underline}** \--
[Estonia]{.underline}, [Latvia]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[Lithuania]{.underline}. [Since]{.underline} [those nations]{.underline}
and several other Eastern European states [joined NATO]{.underline} in
2004, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has been [committed
to defending their freedom]{.underline} and territorial integrity under
Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty.

[Because NATO]{.underline} from its inception [was aimed at
containing]{.underline} the [expansion of]{.underline} a nuclear country
\-- [Russia]{.underline} \-- [a vital part of]{.underline} the U.S.
security [commitment]{.underline} to Europe [consists of Washington\'s
**willingness to use**]{.underline} its [**nuclear arsenal** in defense
of allies]{.underline}. The formal name for that strategy is \"extended
deterrence,\" and since 2004 it has included the Baltic states. Simply
stated, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [seeks to deter
aggression]{.underline} or blackmail [against NATO allies]{.underline}
from a nuclear-armed Russia [by threatening to use atomic
weapons]{.underline}.

The Obama Administration\'s 2010 Nuclear Posture Review confirmed that
extended deterrence remains a pillar of U.S. global strategy. Although
the credibility of extended deterrence ultimately resides in the U.S.
strategic \"triad\" of long-range bombers and missiles, the posture
review explicitly stated that the U.S. would preserve the ability to
deploy nuclear weapons with suitably equipped tactical fighters in
places like Europe.

According to Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists,
the U.S. currently deploys about 200 B61 nuclear gravity bombs in Europe
for use by American or allied forces in a future East-West war. The
weapons are receiving life-extension modifications that will allow their
use for decades to come, first on F-16 fighters and later on the
stealthy F-35 fighter. Russia also deploys a sizable number of so-called
\"non-strategic\" nuclear weapons in the European theater, although like
the U.S. it does not disclose numbers or locations.

While nuclear weapons could potentially be used in any number of future
warfighting scenarios, there are multiple reasons to suspect that the
greatest danger exists with regard to the three Baltic states. Here are
eight of those reasons.

First, both [Washington and Moscow assign **high strategic
significance** to]{.underline} the [future disposition of the Baltic
states]{.underline}. From Moscow\'s perspective, [the]{.underline} three
[states are located close to]{.underline} the centers of [Russian
political and military power]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} therefore
[are a potential base for devastating attacks.]{.underline} For
instance, the distance between Lithuania\'s capital of Vilnius and
Moscow is less than 500 miles \-- a short trip for a supersonic
aircraft. [From Washington\'s perspective]{.underline}, [failure to
protect]{.underline} the [Baltic states from Russian aggression could
lead to]{.underline} the [unraveling of America\'s]{.underline} most
[important alliance]{.underline}.

Second, [Washington has been very public about]{.underline} it
[commitment to the Baltic states]{.underline}. For instance, in 2014
President Obama stated during a visit to Estonia that defense of the
three countries\' capitals was \"just as important as the defense of
Berlin and Paris and London.\" That is an extraordinary assertion
considering that the population of metropolitan London (about 8 million)
is greater than that of all three Baltic states combined (about 6
million), and that [the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea is so close to
the Russian heartland.]{.underline}

Third, [there is]{.underline} a [disconnect between]{.underline} the
[rhetoric that Washington applies to Baltic security and]{.underline}
the [tactical situation that would likely obtain in a future
war]{.underline}. Russia has massive local superiority in every form of
military force, and the topography of the three states presents few
obstacles to being quickly overrun. The RAND Corporation reported
earlier this year that [in a series of war games]{.underline}, [Russian
forces were always able to overcome indigenous defenders and reach
Baltic capitals within a few days]{.underline}. The forces of other NATO
nations had little time to respond.

Fourth, for all of its talk about reinforcing NATO at the recent
alliance summit (\"we will defend every ally\" President Obama said),
[there is **scant evidence** the U.S. is willing to make the kind of
commitment of conventional forces needed to blunt a Russian invasion in
the Baltic region]{.underline}. The proposed [placement of NATO-led
battalions]{.underline} in each state totaling about 1,000 soldiers each
[is]{.underline} widely [described as a]{.underline}
\"**[tripwire]{.underline}**\" defense, [meaning it might trigger a
bigger alliance response but would not]{.underline} be able to [prevent
Moscow from reaching]{.underline} its [military objectives
quickly.]{.underline}

Fifth, [any counter-attack by NATO]{.underline} in the Baltics [could
easily be misconstrued by Moscow as a **threat** to its **core
interests**]{.underline}, in part [because]{.underline} some
[strikes]{.underline} against attacking forces [would occur on Russian
territory]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in part because [Russia\'s
fragile reconnaissance system would quickly be overwhelmed]{.underline}
by the fog of war. Anthony Barrett of the RAND Corporation has recently
produced a worrisome analysis detailing how an East-West [**conventional
conflict** along the Russian periphery could **escalate to
nuclear-weapons** use through **miscues** or
**misjudgments**]{.underline}.

Sixth, [both sides]{.underline} in any such conflict would [have
**military doctrine** potentially **justifying the use of nuclear
weapons** to prevent defeat]{.underline}. In the case of
[Russia]{.underline}, it has stated repeatedly that it needs
non-strategic nuclear weapons to cope with the superiority of NATO
conventional forces, that it [would use]{.underline} such
[weapons]{.underline} in order [to protect its core assets and
values]{.underline}, and even that nuclear weapons might sometimes be
useful tools for de-escalating a conflict. Successive U.S.
administrations have stressed that nuclear weapons underpin alliance
commitments.

Seventh, [both sides have **non-strategic nuclear weapons** in theater
ready for **quick use** if tactical circumstances dictate]{.underline}.
For example, Hans Kristensen noted the presence of several
nuclear-capable military systems in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad
located between Lithuania and Poland. Although the Russians have not
disclosed whether nuclear warheads are also located in the district,
there is little doubt that [hundreds could quickly be deployed to areas
around the Baltic states in an **escalating conflict**]{.underline}.
Nuclear-capable NATO jets could reach the area within hours.

Eighth, [new tech]{.underline}nologies [are]{.underline} gradually
[being incorporated into forces]{.underline} on both sides [that could
**accelerate**]{.underline} the [pace and confusion of a local
conflict]{.underline}. For instance, the F-35 fighter that will replace
F-16s in the tactical nuclear role cannot be tracked by Russian radar.
The integrated air defenses that Russia has deployed in Kaliningrad and
elsewhere on its territory could severely impede NATO use of local air
space in support of ground forces, and Russian electronic-warfare
capabilities could impede coordination of ground maneuvers.

The bottom line is that **[all the ingredients are present in the
eastern Baltic area for an East-West conflict escalating to nuclear
weapons use]{.underline}**. [Neither side understands what actions might
provoke nuclear use by the other]{.underline}, [and once war began both
sides would]{.underline} likely [have a tenuous grasp of what was
happening]{.underline}. The [high stakes]{.underline} assigned to the
outcome of such a conflict [and]{.underline} the ready [availability
of]{.underline} \"[non-strategic]{.underline}\" [nuclear weapons in a
context where either side might view their use as strategic]{.underline}
in consequences [is a prescription for **catastrophe**]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- European Populism

#### Turning inward causes European [re-investment]{.underline} into [domestic]{.underline} arms 

**Trofimov 19** - Columnist and Senior Correspondent, The Wall Street
Journal \[Yaroslav, Jan 4^th^, *Wall Street Journal,* "Is Europe Ready
to Defend Itself?",
<https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-europe-ready-to-defend-itself-11546623417>\]

The new Republican administration in Washington issued a blunt warning:
Unless Europe quickly set up its own unified army, the U.S. would be
compelled to undertake an "agonizing reappraisal" of its commitment to
defend its European allies.

The year was 1953, and the main target of American ire was France, whose
delay in ratifying the European Defense Community treaty, signed the
previous year, meant that preparations for a federal European army had
to be paused. But the pressure applied by the Eisenhower administration
backfired spectacularly: A joyous choir of French lawmakers broke into
the "Marseillaise" when France's parliament finally rejected the treaty
in August 1954. The idea of a joint European defense policy was shelved
for decades.

[Today]{.underline}, [the push for **European autonomy**]{.underline} in
defense---[and]{.underline} even for [a common]{.underline} European
Union [army]{.underline}---**[is gathering momentum
again]{.underline}**, in part [because of]{.underline} [**doubts** in
many European capitals about]{.underline} President Donald [Trump's
**willingness to defend** the continent against]{.underline} a renewed
threat from [Russia]{.underline}. Mr. Trump's abrupt decision to
withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, which prompted Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis to resign, has added new urgency to the drive.

This time around, the [revival]{.underline} of European defense
integration [is championed by]{.underline} French President Emmanuel
**[Macron and]{.underline}** German Chancellor Angela
**[Merkel]{.underline}**, while the American president keeps lobbing
angry tweets at the very idea. And inside Europe, the skeptics today
aren't in Paris but in the former Soviet vassal-states in the east that,
despite all their misgivings, still view the U.S. as the only credible
guarantor of their survival as independent nations.

[A historic swing in]{.underline} Europe's [public opinion]{.underline},
particularly in Germany---**[the EU's most powerful state]{.underline}**
and one where trans-Atlantic cooperation was the bedrock of the
political consensus since the end of World War II---[has fueled this
change]{.underline}.

Mr. Trump has described the EU as a "foe" and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization as "obsolete," and he has publicly questioned why American
soldiers should die for a NATO ally like Montenegro. One recent opinion
poll showed that [Germans]{.underline} now [rank]{.underline} Mr.
[Trump]{.underline} **[as the greatest threat]{.underline}** to their
country. In another, 73% of Germans described their relationship with
the U.S. as "bad," and [72% wanted]{.underline} [a foreign policy **more
independent**]{.underline} [from Washington's]{.underline}.

"[The shift in public opinion is due to]{.underline} a mix of
disappointment and fear," said Volker Perthes, director of the German
Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think tank that
advises the German government and parliament. "There is a [fear that the
U.S. will be **less interested** in Europe, and that the security
commitments of the U.S. will **no longer be reliable**]{.underline}."

It was in this political environment that Ms. Merkel told the European
Parliament in a landmark speech in November: "The times when we could
fully rely on others have ended....If we Europeans want to survive as a
community, we must make a greater effort to take our destiny into our
own hands."

Achieving such "strategic autonomy" became the EU's official policy in
2016. [Though calls by]{.underline} Mr. [Macron and]{.underline} Ms.
[Merkel]{.underline} for a European army **[are largely
rhetorical]{.underline}** so far, several [**concrete initiatives** to
achieve that goal have been launched]{.underline} since then. Probably
most significant is [the]{.underline} \$15 billion [European Defense
Fund]{.underline}, which aims to spur Europe's military industry and
could limit the influence of American weapons manufacturers. Another new
initiative is the so-called [Permanent Structured Cooperation
system]{.underline}, under which European armies seek to remove the
barriers to joint action that stem from fielding so many different---and
often incompatible---types of weapons. Addressing a frequently voiced
demand of Mr. Trump, European governments have also raised their defense
spending to get closer to the NATO target of 2% of each country's GDP.

On the face of it, there is no reason why an economic giant like the EU
shouldn't be able to protect itself against Russia even without American
help. Setting aside Britain (which seeks to continue to cooperate with
the EU on security and defense even after leaving the bloc), the
remaining EU's population and defense budgets are roughly three times
Russia's size. France, the EU's military powerhouse, spends almost as
much as Russia on defense just by itself and operates an independent
nuclear arsenal. All those sums, of course, are dwarfed by the U.S.,
whose military budget is nearly double the defense spending of the EU
(minus the departing U.K.) and Russia combined.

"Europe is addicted to the American security umbrella," said Bruno
Tertrais, deputy director of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a
think tank that advises the French government. "But if the U.S. weren't
there, Europe would have found a way to defend itself."

Yet there is a Catch-22 that makes these aspirations risky. [Building
up]{.underline} European defenses **[after seven decades]{.underline}**
[of American protection]{.underline} **[would take time]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, every move that Europe attempts in this direction spurs an
American backlash, further undermining NATO's cohesion---and its
deterrent capacity against a rapidly militarizing Russia.

"We have to hedge. But it is a very tricky situation: When does the
hedge become a wedge?" said François Heisbourg, a veteran French expert
who advised Mr. Macron's presidential campaign on security and defense.

"[Trump doesn't believe in alliances]{.underline} and doesn't understand
what an alliance is," he added. "So [if we discover that Plan
A]{.underline}---what has happened over the last 70 years---**[is no
longer on offer]{.underline}**, [**we would have been remiss** if we had
not worked on Plan B]{.underline}. But of course, we do not want to
precipitate the end of Plan A by getting Plan B wrong. This is the
challenge for every country that is allied with the U.S."

It is a particularly urgent challenge for NATO countries in Eastern and
Central Europe. Officials there fret about loose talk of a European army
and dislike the very concept of EU "strategic autonomy," fearing that it
may needlessly alienate the U.S. After all, if you border on Russia,
what you want is more Americans in your neighborhood now, not a pretext
for cost-conscious Washington to pull the plug. "Autonomy means autonomy
from someone---it's better to use another term, such as a European push
forward or European structural strengthening," said Lithuania's defense
minister, Raimundas Karoblis.

Poland, another neighbor of Russia, has even offered to pay more than
\$2 billion to set up a permanent U.S. base on its soil, proposing to
call it Fort Trump in a not-so-subtle appeal to the president's vanity.
(Washington is still evaluating the proposal, while German officials are
lobbying against it, fearing that it would further antagonize Russia.)

"We believe that the [United States is indispensable in European
security]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} Bartosz Cichocki, [Poland's
deputy foreign minister]{.underline} for security affairs. He held up
the November 2018 incident in the Black Sea, where Russia attacked and
seized three Ukrainian navy ships, as a sobering example of just how
hollow the EU's role in defending the region's security remains. "Where
was Europe? Nowhere. Those who advocate a European army, European
self-sufficiency, had a great opportunity to take the lead, to show us
the way of how to de-escalate and how to stop Russia," he scoffed.

Such [divisions within Europe on security matters make it a much
**weaker adversary for Russia**]{.underline}, which has spent the past
decade upgrading its military and is now fielding an entire new tank
army on the EU's eastern flank.

The EU is likely dealing with a lasting change in the global security
architecture.

"In defense and defense industry, it is not Europe, it is 28 European
states," said Christian Mölling, [deputy director of Germany's
DGAP]{.underline} research institute, who co-[wrote]{.underline} a
recent report outlining the shortfalls in the EU's military muscle. "If
you take trade, we are acting as one with a central and single policy,
which makes us the biggest trading bloc in the world. But in defense,
**[we are not able to act as a huge force."]{.underline}**

#### That [trades off]{.underline} with social services\-\--it massively increases [populism]{.underline} and [unrest]{.underline} 

**Youngs 17** - Senior fellow in the democracy and rule of law program
at Carnegie Europe. \[Richard, 6/15/17, *Politico,* "Europe's defense
fund ignores real threat: populism",
<https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-defense-fund-ignores-real-threat-populism-security-union/>\]

[The E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion['s recently
launched]{.underline} [defense fund]{.underline} has been widely praised
as a long-overdue step toward defense autonomy, a real game-changer at a
time when the United States has become an increasingly unreliable ally
on security issues.

These steps toward a so-called security union and common defense
policies were even hailed by some EU leaders as the key to injecting
fresh momentum into the European project after a decade of crises.

There's no question the EU should boost its defense capabilities and
excise wasteful duplication in its members' military arsenals. But the
plans being discussed **[could seriously backfire]{.underline}**.

[The EU]{.underline} has always [struggled to close the distance
between]{.underline} its [institutions and its citizens]{.underline}.
The problem has worsened over the past few years, as fringe anti-EU
political parties moved into the mainstream, riding public concerns
about the bloc's insufficient transparency and accountability.

Given that defense and security are particularly opaque policy areas,
[pumping large amounts of money into those industries may simply feed
**popular mistrust**]{.underline} of the EU --- especially if there is
no parallel progress in making the bloc's legislative process more
accountable.

In countries where the EU has spent recent years imposing harsh spending
cuts on pensions, education and health care, the fact that the European
Commission has suddenly found €1.5 billion a year for defense
expenditure is unlikely to boost the bloc's popularity. If the EU is
serious about shoring up its image and reaching voters in more
meaningful ways, it should direct resources into reversing the harm done
by a decade of austerity.

Indeed, the EU's [defense plans]{.underline} [appear entirely
disconnected from any political strategy for **addressing
populism**]{.underline} or the underlying pathologies plaguing the
European project, both of which pose real threats to the bloc's survival
and long-term security.

[The defense fund is part of a broader "securitization" of EU foreign
policy]{.underline} that bodes ill for future stability. [It could also
**draw resources away from area**s]{.underline} of EU foreign policy
[that are crucial to dealing with the geopolitical drivers behind the
threats Europe faces]{.underline}.

[The amount of money the EU]{.underline} and its member countries
[commit to promoting human rights]{.underline}, encouraging [democratic
reforms and]{.underline} strengthening [civil society is extremely
limited compared to]{.underline} the budget touted for [the defense
fund]{.underline}. And, in recent years, most member nations have
slashed their aid budgets.

The EU's inability to resolve conflict in places like Syria, Libya and
Ukraine has nothing to do with a lack of joint weapons programs.

Europe's aid program is increasingly imbalanced. Across North Africa and
the Middle East, the Sahel and some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the EU
has made funds available to authoritarian regimes to help limit migrant
outflows. By doing so, it is doing little to foster the kind of
democratic change that would help address the underlying causes of the
migration. [Funds that boost unaccountable security forces are more
likely to intensify]{.underline} rather than temper **[insecurity,
instability and radicalization.]{.underline}**

The EU's inability to resolve conflict in places like Syria, Libya and
Ukraine has nothing to do with a lack of joint weapons programs. It is
the result of weak strategic commitment and an unwillingness to support
the kind of political solutions that would stabilize these regions.

Citizens across the Continent undoubtedly want the EU to keep them safe,
but the [emerging security and defense plans do not reflect]{.underline}
[the kind of Union capable of winning]{.underline} back popular
[affection and stemming the populist tide]{.underline}.

foreign affairs]{.underline}. This matters, as Jeff Colgan notes: \"risk
tolerance leads to aggression in international affairs because it
increases the perceived payoff of risky gambles.\" 17 [Populist leaders
more closely resemble revolutionaries than more established

domestically]{.underline}.\" 18 [We can see this kind of ambition on
display among elected populists]{.underline}. Hugo Chávez \[\*30\]

One longtime friend of Viktor Orbán noted, \"he has always wanted to
upset the status quo, to become a change-maker.\" 19 Orbán himself, in a
meeting with Polish Law and Justice Party head Jaroslaw Kaczynski,
proposed a \"cultural counter-revolution\" in Europe. 20 Donald Trump\'s
inaugural address categorically rejected the postwar liberal order,
arguing in favor of an \"America First\" approach to international
relations. [Populists are therefore more likely to pursue high-risk,
revisionist foreign policies]{.underline}. [Populist
leaders]{.underline} also care about recognition by others, and [will be
quick to anger]{.underline} if that recognition is not forthcoming.
Populists build their legitimacy on their support from \"their\" people,
but part of that support comes from displays of dominance over others.
Russian president Vladimir Putin is well-known for his over-the-top
efforts to look strong and powerful. These range from his shirtless
photos to videos of him weightlifting to scoring eight goals in an
exhibition game with former NHL All-Stars. 21 In Erdogan\'s first two
years as Turkey\'s president, the government has prosecuted more than
1,800 cases of Turkish citizens insulting him\--including a former Miss
Turkey. 22 Donald Trump has insulted anyone who has criticized him since
he started running for president, ranging from erstwhile GOP rivals to
federal judges to media outlets to a former Miss Universe to Meryl
Streep. When dealing with domestic rivals and critics, such displays of
dominance are an easy strategy for elected leaders to pursue. Populist
leaders engage in such behavior to project their strength and mastery
over the political fates. It is tricky to do this on the international
stage, however. [Populist leaders will]{.underline} therefore [be more
concerned than most politicians about]{.underline} the personal
[respect]{.underline} afforded to them by others. At the international
level, this leads to one of two outcomes: recognition by other heads of
state, or a denunciation of leaders who fail to confer such recognition.
If [populists]{.underline} cannot exploit the respect conferred by
others, they [will be quick to reject and delegitimize the leaders who
spurn them]{.underline}. We can see this kind of pattern at work in how
populist leaders have reacted to setbacks on the global stage. Vladimir
Putin began his tenure in office with a much warmer attitude towards the
West. During the first decade of this century, however, Putin lost an
ally during Ukraine\'s Orange Revolution, and witnessed NATO expanding
to Russia\'s borders. It was at this point that Putin began adopting a
more hostile attitude towards the West. After President Obama cancelled
a meeting with Duterte, the Filipino president responded with a series
of tirades insulting the American president. 23 In Trump\'s first week
as president, he faced pushback from the \[\*31\] Mexican president
Enrique Peña Nieto on his policies for the southern border. In response,
Trump tweeted that Peña Nieto should not bother coming to Washington.
The Mexican president responded by canceling his visit. Populists do not
possess a monopoly on anger in politics, but most populists tend to
project anger as part of their leadership style. Based on their pathway
to power and their philosophy of governance, it should not be surprising
that they are commonly associated with that emotion. As previously
noted, populist parties do particularly well after financial crises.
They are adept at exploiting the (often justified) anger that voters
possess towards authorities that were in charge when the crisis
happened. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage warned of \"political anger\"
if the United Kingdom did not follow through on Brexit. In a press
conference blasting the United States, Duterte said, \"If you Americans
are angry with me, then I am also angry with you.\" 24 During one of the
GOP primary debates, Donald Trump explicitly stated, \"I will gladly
accept the mantle of anger.\" Trump famously refuses to apologize when
he makes controversial or problematic statements. 25 Numerous press
reports suggest that Trump lost his temper with the Australian prime
minister in their first phone conversation. [This wave of populist anger
reverses a centuries-long western effort to contain that emotion in
international relations]{.underline}. 26 Recent scholarship on emotions
in world politics suggest that [sustained levels of anger carry risks in
world politics.]{.underline} Anger was valorized in societies with
strong honor cultures and warrior castes, biologically conditioning
citizens towards that feeling. Furthermore, as Neta Crawford notes,
\"[threats that evoke anger]{.underline} (if they are associated with
perceived insults) tend to [**decrease** the perception of a threat and
simultaneously **heighten risk-taking** behaviors on the part of those
who feel angry]{.underline}.\" 27 This is particularly true if populist
leaders find ways to institutionalize anger and resentment through new
laws, executive orders, or bureaucratic structures. [This tendency
towards angry rhetoric can be exaggerated through misperception and
mistranslation]{.underline}. Conventional foreign policy leaders are
prepped to stay within the lanes of \"accepted\" diplomatic discourse,
so that observers can detect subtle shifts in phrasing as a foreign
policy signal. In contrast, populists scorn diplomatic language as
exercises in sophistry and hypocrisy. They rely on language designed to
appeal to their base, which increases the likelihood that outside
observers misconstrue their words. [Angry tirades from
leaders]{.underline} like Trump, Duterte, or Iran\'s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
have been mistranslated\--and usually in a direction that \[\*32\]
[paints the leader as more bellicose than intended]{.underline}. 28
[Populist leaders will be reluctant to correct such
misperceptions]{.underline}, because that would require them to engage
in the diplomatic discourse they have derided. Displays of righteous
indignation might play well with a populist leader\'s domestic base. The
international effect of angry outbursts, however, is to narrow the zone
of cooperation between countries. If a leader unleashes an angry tirade
against another country, that is sure to gain considerable public
attention in both nations. This automatically raises the \"audience
costs\" for both leaders. The larger the audience that is paying
attention to any dispute, the greater the political costs a leader can
suffer if they back down in that dispute. 29 Displays of temper make it
harder for the populist to compromise, but it will also make it more
politically difficult for the object of the tirade to make any
concessions. Through effects on leaders and populations, [provocations
make negotiations more costly and conflict escalation more
likely]{.underline}. 30 Perhaps the most important intellectual trait
that populist leaders share is their tendency to think like hedgehogs.
According to the classical Greek poet Archilochus, \"a fox knows many
things, but a hedgehog one important thing.\" Isaiah Berlin popularized
that quote, arguing that intellectuals could be divided into foxes and
hedgehogs. This works for decision-makers as well. Foxes will possess
the necessary metacognition to adapt to new facts and new circumstances;
hedgehogs will rely on their core beliefs, fitting the world into their
preexisting worldview. 31 Populists are hedgehogs: the one big thing
that they know is to reject the elites and technocrats who heretofore
governed their country. As Philip Tetlock observed more than a decade
ago, foxes and hedgehogs have different strengths when it comes to
thinking about the world. 32 Foxes are much better than hedgehogs in
their predictive accuracy about world events; simply put, foxes are
better at incorporating new information and updating how they think
about the world. Hedgehogs are better than foxes at anticipating big and
unexpected events happening in the world, such as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 2008 financial crisis.
Anticipating those events requires an assuredness about the way the
world works that hedgehogs are more likely to possess. The effects of
these different intellectual styles on foreign policy are
straightforward. As hedgehogs, [populists are more likely to have their
expectations confounded in world politics]{.underline}. At the same
time, [populist foreign policy leaders will face psychological and
domestic political barriers to admitting error or reversing a failing
policy]{.underline}. Any public recognition of a misstep demonstrates a
leader\'s fallibility\--which is problematic for leaders \[\*33\] who
claim that they can divine the general will of the people. At the same
time, as hedgehogs, populists will be reluctant to take any action that
deviates from the way that they think the world works. Stepping back, we
can proffer some tentative predictions of how populist foreign policy
leaders will behave in the coming years. [Populist foreign policy
leaders are likely to reject the pre-existing liberal international
order and espouse]{.underline} a strong form of [ethnic
nationalism]{.underline}. They might try to create alternative
international arrangements to the status quo, but these efforts are
likely to be Potemkin efforts, with more pomp and circumstance than
substance. [Populist leaders will have greater appetites for risk and
ambition on the global stage]{.underline}. These heads of state will
crave recognition from their fellow world leaders, and be quick to anger
if they are spurned in this area. These displays of anger could become
institutionalized and will increase the audience costs of all the
involved actors, making cooperation less likely. And [populists are less
likely to correctly perceive how the world works]{.underline}, and more
likely to hold firm with policies that are not viewed as working
terribly well. [One disturbing conclusion to draw from this particular
constellation of traits is that populist leaders are more likely to
foment international crises]{.underline}. [Breaking with pre-existing
global governance structures can **guarantee a crisis
escalation**]{.underline}. [An international crisis can trigger
**rally-round-the flag** effects]{.underline} within the domestic
population and make it easier for a leader to suppress domestic dissent.
At the extreme, [one could envision populists threatening or launching
diversionary wars to appeal to a nationalist base in times of
trouble]{.underline}. Vladimir Putin employed this tactic. In early
2014, he was still reeling from protests over his return to the Russian
presidency, and a slowdown in the Russian economy. He responded by
annexing the Crimea after the fall of his ally in Ukraine, and
bankrolling a secessionist conflict in Eastern Ukraine. These efforts
caused his public support to skyrocket even though the Russian economy
contracted in 2014 and 2015. It should be stressed that these are all
probabilistic statements. Many of these traits are hardly unique to
populists; other heads of state are likely to display some subset of
these leadership traits. Still, [this combination of]{.underline}
\[\*34\] [attributes suggest that the world is **experiencing an
increase in the number of revisionist, risky, and violent actions in
world politics.**]{.underline}

### AT: NATO can survive without the US

#### US leadership is key to NATO effectiveness

**NYT 2018** - Editorial Board\
\"Why NATO Matters,\" Jul 8,
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/opinion/editorials/why-nato-matters.html

Across seven decades NATO has invoked its Article 5 mutual defense
commitment only once: to rally to the defense of the United States after
the attacks of 9/11. Even today, the armed forces of 39 countries are
serving, and sometimes dying, with American troops in Afghanistan.

More than 70 (NATO and non-NATO) countries are part of the U.S.-led
fight against the Islamic State; two dozen countries have joined a
global counterterrorism initiative.

In short, [NATO remains central to major American national security
initiatives in a world shaken by the rise of an increasingly assertive
China, the expansion of]{.underline} competing power centers from India
to [Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, the surge of migration from the Middle
East and Africa [and]{.underline} the dislocations caused by
[globalizatio]{.underline}n.

[Yet NATO is being weakened from within --- by members' failure to spend
enough]{.underline} on defense; by the rise of nationalism and
authoritarianism, especially in Turkey, Hungary and Poland; and perhaps
most of all, by President Trump, who seems to prefer President Vladimir
Putin of Russia to America's European allies.

[NATO has always depended on leadership from the United
States,]{.underline} the world's biggest economy and most lethal
military power. Mr. Trump not only doesn't want to lead the West, he has
denigrated the alliance, bullied its leaders and accused NATO and the
European Union of exploiting American largess.

### 2AC AT: Burden Sharing

#### Their burden sharing arguments are wrong -- all countries benefit from NATO stability

Trump's diatribes are not the only cause of the unease[. A broadening
chorus of realist strategists claims that the United States is overdue
for]{.underline} a major strategic [retrenchment and that it is past
time for Europe to tend its own garden]{.underline}. Even staunch
defenders of NATO express doubts about its future. Some worry that the
growing U.S. preoccupation with East Asia will lure the United States
away from its Atlantic calling and generate transatlantic tensions over
how to deal with the rise of China. Others fear that democratic
backsliding among members is compromising the alliance's values-based
solidarity. Close NATO watchers are concerned that EU efforts to more
deeply integrate European foreign and defense policy could ultimately
weaken the Atlantic link. And debate rages on both sides of the Atlantic
as to whether NATO enlargement has enhanced or eroded European stability
and whether to continue expansion despite the costs to the West's
relationship with Russia.

[These worries are unwarranted]{.underline}: [NATO at 70 is actually in
remarkably good shape]{.underline}. [Yes, European allies have been
laggards on defense spending]{.underline}, and some members---Hungary,
Poland, and Turkey in particular---have tarnished democratic
credentials. [But NATO has demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt
to the changing geopolitical environment]{.underline} since the Cold
War's end, [ensuring that the United States and Europe remain each
other's go-to partners]{.underline}. The alliance opened its doors to
the new democracies that emerged from the former Soviet bloc, helping to
anchor security and democracy in a wider Europe. Since Russia's invasion
of Ukraine in 2014, members have taken important steps to strengthen
deterrence against the Kremlin's adventurism. NATO has struck
partnerships across the globe and carried out ambitious missions well
beyond the territory of member states---most notably in the Balkans,
Afghanistan, and Libya. All the while, [the alliance has retooled to
address new hazards such as cyberthreats, terrorism, hybrid warfare, and
migration]{.underline}. Precisely because NATO has been so nimble and
effective, it enjoys strong political support on both sides of the
Atlantic, leaving Trump virtually alone as a vociferous critic.

#### Europe is increasing funding -- prefer evidence from this week

Support on the other side of the Atlantic is similarly strong. Around
two-thirds of Europeans approve of the alliance. Most European
democracies not yet members of NATO are clamoring to get in.Confidence
in U.S. leadership may have plummeted, but Europeans still want their
security guarantor to stay put. Furthermore, [European member states are
finally taking steps to increase defense spending]{.underline}.
[Twenty-four of NATO's 29 members increased their defense budgets in
2018, and nine NATO members will this year reach the NATO
benchmark]{.underline} of spending two percent of GDP on
defense---compared with just four members in 2014. A majority of members
are on track to meet this benchmark by the target date of 2024 set at
the 2014 summit.

Even Trump is applauding Europe for raising its military spending,
noting in his February State of the Union that "we have secured a \$100
billion dollar increase in defense spending from NATO allies." [The
uptick in spending actually began before Trump was
elected]{.underline}---the product of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and
the 2014 summit at which the two percent benchmark was formalized.
Nonetheless, [if letting Trump take credit for convincing Europeans to
invest more in defense improves his view of the alliance, then let's by
all means indulge him]{.underline}.

### AT: Terror/Cyber

#### NATO is the most effective tool to confront cyber and terror threats

A VALUABLE ALLIANCE

NATO is entering its eighth decade in quite good health because it
succeeds admirably in advancing the shared interests of its members.
Russian aggression in Ukraine has brought back into focus NATO's
traditional mission of territorial defense. At its 2016 summit, NATO
took the prudent step of deploying combat-ready battalions in Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. The United States has augmented its
presence on the eastern flank, and the Trump administration has agreed
to increase spending on European defense and deploy additional U.S.
troops on the continent. At its 2018 summit, NATO established two new
commands to enhance the security of maritime connections between North
America and Europe and improve force mobility within Europe.

[NATO helped end ethnic conflict in the Balkans]{.underline} in the
1990s [and has kept troops there ever since to guard the
peace.]{.underline} Despite the difficulties and dangers of the mission
[in Afghanistan]{.underline}, since 2003 [NATO has stayed the
course,]{.underline} standing by its first and only invocation of
Article 5---the commitment to collective defense---which followed the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. [The alliance has contributed
significantly to the campaign against]{.underline} the Islamic State (or
[ISIS),]{.underline} providing surveillance aircraft and helping train
Iraqi forces. NATO has deployed ships to the Aegean and the
Mediterranean to help provide maritime security and address the
migration crisis.

In addition to these missions, [NATO works continuously to build
capacity among its many partners]{.underline}. The Partnership for Peace
offers training and exercises to Euro-Atlantic nonmembers. Through the
Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, NATO
advises many countries in the broader Middle East, including Egypt,
Israel, Morocco, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. NATO has
cooperation agreements with its global partners, which include
Australia, Japan, Korea, and Pakistan. [The alliance has already
opened]{.underline} the European Centre of Excellence for Countering
Hybrid Threats and [is in the midst of establishing a]{.underline} [new
Cyberspace Operations Centre]{.underline}.

### US Lead Good

#### NATO is [key]{.underline}\-\--it's a [full-spectrum]{.underline} force multiplier and [guarantees]{.underline} multilateral logistics 

**Weinrod 16** - Former Secretary of Defense Representative Europe and
Defense Advisor to the U.S. Mission NATO (W Bruce, "We Still Need NATO,"
The American Interest,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/01/15/we-still-need-nato/)

[Not only does NATO remain relevant, but more importantly it continues
to support and advance U.S. security interests]{.underline}---though
again, often in ways that do not make headlines and that casual
observers rarely appreciate in full. Most fundamentally, [NATO provides
a standing multilateral military capability that can **deter or be
deployed** should a significant security threat arise]{.underline}.
Because NATO has a military capability in place, the core elements for
mobilization, deployment, and sustainment of substantial multilateral
military forces already exist. The [ongoing training, exercises, and
regular communication among the national militaries of NATO members
allows them to **jump-start** preparations and actions when needed
**without** very lengthy preparatory work]{.underline}. [This can allow
the U.S. government to proceed in shaping and leading military
coalitions more quickly, at less cost and with greater effectiveness,
than if NATO did not exist and its functional equivalent had to be
invented from scratch at a moment's not]{.underline}ice. While the U.S.
government retains the capacity and the right to act unilaterally if and
when necessary, it makes sense for it to act with others whenever
possible, whether through NATO or ad hoc coalitions of the willing. [A
multilateral framework can provide both political cover and military
resources, and the United States very much can benefit from
both]{.underline}. [The United States also benefits significantly from
NATO's **logistics** capabilities]{.underline}. Pontificating about
grand strategies sounds impressive, but for military effectiveness and
success, [logistics capabilities are what really count]{.underline}.
[For example, while NATO did not formally participate in the 1991 Gulf
War, NATO resources, supplies, bases, and other infrastructure provided
crucial support prior to and during the U.S.-led coalition military
action to force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.]{.underline} The coalition
in effect borrowed NATO capacities already in existence, and benefitted
greatly from equipment compatibility and common training and resources.
[Other coalitions of the willing assembled under U.S auspices and
utilizing NATO resources can follow the same approach]{.underline}. In
addition, [the U.S. government has access to the numerous military
facilities and resources that member nations make available to NATO. A
good example is Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, now being used against ISIS
in what is not a formal NATO operation]{.underline}. As importantly,
[working through NATO usually makes it relatively **routine** for host
governments to **agree** to U.S. requests to use facilities within their
territory for military-related purposes]{.underline}. [Without
NATO,]{.underline} in order to fulfill its security responsibilities,
the U.S. government would need to develop and maintain a complex network
of bilateral and multilateral security agreements and arrangements that
would seek to maintain the kind of connectivity and flexibility that
NATO already provides. Further, [the U.S. government would need not only
agreements to access such military facilities but also would likely need
to obtain specific approval from the host nation for each use and
perhaps even in some cases legislative approval]{.underline}. In
general, [it is much simpler, faster, and **easier politically** and
otherwise for nations to grant the United States the use of their
facilities within a NATO framework than it would be to have to grant
permission to the United States on their own]{.underline}. Over recent
decades [NATO]{.underline} has, as noted above, [developed]{.underline}
a [global security]{.underline} network that reflects formalized
relationships with non-NATO nations. For the United States, this brings
the advantage that it can work through NATO to develop or enhance
security relationships with states that belong to the PFP, the MD, the
ICI, and NATO bilateral security relationships. [Working through NATO
provides an extra dimension to U.S. efforts to enhance the military
capacities of friends and allies in various regions who, with training
and assistance, can provide supplementary support to NATO or U.S.-led
operations. NATO also supports U.S. interests by providing a
multilateral framework for a U.S. presence in nations where the U.S.
government wishes to help train and also enhance its military contacts,
but where unilateral U.S. military involvement might be politically
contentious]{.underline}.
