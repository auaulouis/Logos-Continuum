The economic, political and security strategy that the United States has
pursued for more than seven decades, under Democratic and Republican
administrations alike, is today widely questioned by large segments of
the American public and is under attack by leading political candidates
in both parties. Many Americans no longer seem to value the liberal
international order that the United States created after World War II
and sustained throughout the Cold War and beyond. Or perhaps they take
it for granted and have lost sight of [[the essential role the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [plays in]{.mark}]{.underline}
supporting the international environment from which they benefit
greatly. [The [unprecedented prosperity made possible by free]{.mark}
and open [markets]{.mark} and [thriving international trade]{.mark}; the
spread of democracy; [and the avoidance of major conflict among great
powers: All]{.mark} these remarkable [accomplishments]{.mark} have
[depend]{.mark}ed [on sustained U.S. engagement around the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet politicians in both parties dangle
before the public the vision of an America freed from the burdens of
leadership. [What these politicians don't say, perhaps because they
don't understand it themselves, is that the **[price of ending our
engagement would far outweigh its costs]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
international order created by the United States today faces challenges
greater than at any time since the height of the Cold War. [[Rising
authoritarian powers]{.mark} in Asia and Europe [threaten to undermine
the security structures that have kept the peace since World War
II.]{.mark} **[Russia invaded Ukraine]{.mark}** and has seized some of
its territory. In East Asia, [an **increasingly aggressive China** seeks
to control]{.mark} the sea [lanes through which a large share of global
commerce flows]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the Middle East, Iran pursues
hegemony by supporting Hezbollah and Hamas and the bloody tyranny in
Syria. The Islamic State controls more territory than any terrorist
group in history, brutally imposing its extreme vision of Islam and
striking at targets throughout the Middle East, North Africa and Europe.
[[None of these threats will]{.mark} simply [go away. Nor will the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [be spared if the international
order collapses,]{.mark} as it did twice in the 20th century. [In the
21st century, oceans provide no security]{.mark}. Nor do walls along
borders. Nor would cutting off the United States from the international
economy by trashing trade agreements and erecting barriers to commerce.
[Instead of following]{.mark} the [irresponsible]{.mark} counsel of
[demagogues, we need to restore]{.mark} a bipartisan [foreign policy
consensus around renewing U.S. global leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Despite predictions of a "post-American world,"]{.underline}
]{.mark}[U.S. capacities remain considerable. The [**U.S. economy
remains the most dynamic in the world**.]{.mark} The widely touted "rise
of the rest"---[the idea that the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[was being overtaken by the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and
China---has proved to be a myth.]{.mark}]{.underline} The dollar remains
the world's reserve currency, and people across the globe seek U.S.
investment and entrepreneurial skills to help their flagging economies.
U.S. institutions of higher learning remain the world's best and attract
students from every corner of the globe. [The [political values]{.mark}
that [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [stands for remain
potent forces for change]{.mark}. Even at a time of resurgent autocracy,
popular [demands for greater freedom]{.mark} can be heard in Russia,
China, Iran and elsewhere, and those peoples [look to the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [for support]{.mark}, both moral
and material]{.underline}. And our strategic position remains strong.
The United States has more than 50 allies and partners around the world.
Russia and China between them have no more than a handful.

### 2AC -- Impact -- Solves War

#### Global economic interdependence stifles hegemonic war 

Michael **Mousseau, 19** (Professor in the School of Politics, Security,
and International Affairs at the University of Central Florida, PhD from
Binghamton University; "The End of War: How a Robust Marketplace and
Liberal Hegemony Are Leading to perpetual World Peace"; International

Hegemonic realist theories largely predict never-ending cycles of global
war and peace, caused principally by varying rates of economic growth
among leading powers that trigger relative gains concerns and yield
opportunities for rising powers to assert control and change the rules
of the global order. This section identifies four core reasons why
[[hegemonic war]{.mark}, defined as a clash over global leadership, [is
not only unlikely]{.mark} in the future, [but]{.mark} probably [never
happened in the past]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, [[if internal factors
determine national interests]{.mark}, as I argue, [then heg]{.mark}emony
[cannot exist among]{.mark} status [major powers]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Preferring disorder wherever they lack control, status
powers]{.underline}]{.mark} [simply [are unconcerned with global rules,
and]{.mark} thus [have no interest in fighting over
them]{.mark}.]{.underline} Motivated foremost to make others their
subordinates and avoid being the subordinate of others, status major
powers have nothing to gain and everything to lose in acquiescing to
stronger states, and therefore usually balance against them. Second,
[[status states cannot reach the level of economic productivity]{.mark}
per capita [of contractualist states]{.mark}, and [thus it]{.mark} i[s
unlikely]{.mark} that [any status power could overtake]{.mark} the
[combined might of the contractualist heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline}.
Fortune may occasionally bestow wealth on a status or axial economy, as
it did on the antebellum South, which sold cotton and tobacco in global
markets, and as it does on oil-rich states today. But wealth is not
economic productivity, so such [states are ultimately [dependent on the
contractualist hegemony]{.mark} and [can never seriously challenge
it]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This explains why the South lost the
Civil War. The third reason why hegemonic war resulting from changes in
relative economic power is unlikely follows from the second reason: in
all likelihood, only another contractualist state can surpass the market
leader in economic size; and as discussed, no rising contractualist
power would ever challenge a declining one. Contractualist states are
uninterested in relative power (unless a state is behaving in a
threatening manner), and among them, there are no substantial changes in
global rules to fight about. Fourth, [[even if]{.mark} one were to
suppose that [a rising contractualist power wanted to be
dominant]{.mark} among all contractual states, such [a power shift
cannot happen, because]{.mark} these [states' economies cannot
substantially rise and fall relative to one another. **As a result of
their shared economic type and preferences for normal trade, their
economies have largely converged**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### American hegemony can coordinate capabilities and protect security in the cyber domain

[The [clash of national and global interests in cyberspace is]{.mark}
particularly [acute because there is no global government to resolve
disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sustaining cooperation under anarchy is
an enduring puzzle for international relations theorists and animates
some of the most enduring debates in political science. Realist scholars
view the international system as prone to conflict because there is no
higher authority that can enforce agreements among states (Waltz 1979).
Liberal theorists, however, posit that international institutions can
foster cooperation in part by reducing transaction costs (Keohane 1984).
Extensions of this debate, including arguments about the value of
institutions, are discussed below. But perhaps the most controversial
argument focuses on the role of a hegemon, or a clearly dominant state,
in the international system. Hegemonic stability theory (HST) posits
that peace and prosperity are more likely when there is a clear
hierarchy of states and one undisputed leader[. [A state with dominant
capabilities can sustain cooperation by providing public goods and
reducing collective action problems]{.mark}. Incentives to cheat on
agreements or free ride are reduced when the hegemon picks up the tab.
[Hegemons]{.mark} also [help **coordinate action and deter challengers
from threatening the global order**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC -- No Thucydides Trap

#### No Thucydides Trap -- Economic competition fosters peace

Michael **Mousseau, 19** (Professor in the School of Politics, Security,
and International Affairs at the University of Central Florida, PhD from
Binghamton University; "The End of War: How a Robust Marketplace and
Liberal Hegemony Are Leading to perpetual World Peace"; International
Security 2019; 44 (1): 160--196. doi:

This article argues that [[there is no Thucydides Trap in international
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather, [the [world is moving rapidly
toward permanent peace]{.mark}]{.underline}, possibly in our lifetime.
Drawing on economic norms theory, I show that [**[what sometimes appears
to be a Thucydides Trap]{.mark} may [instead]{.mark} be [a function of
factors strictly internal to states ]{.mark}**and that these factors
vary among them.]{.underline} In brief, [[leaders of states with
advanced market-oriented economies have foremost interests in the
principle of self-determination for all states]{.mark}, large and small,
as the foundation for a robust global marketplace]{.underline}. War
among these states, even making preparations for war, is not possible,
because they are in a natural alliance to preserve and protect the
global order. In contrast, leaders of states with weak internal markets
have little interest in the global marketplace; they pursue wealth not
through commerce, but through wars of expansion and demands for tribute.
For these states, power equals threat, and therefore they tend to
balance against the power of all states. Fearing stronger states,
however, minor powers with weak internal markets tend to constrain their
expansionist inclinations and, for security reasons, bandwagon with the
relatively benign market-oriented powers. I argue that this liberal
global hierarchy is unwittingly but systematically buttressing states'
embrace of market norms and values that, if left uninterrupted, is
likely to culminate in permanent world peace, perhaps even something
close to harmony. My argument challenges the realist assertion that
great powers are engaged in a timeless competition over global
leadership, because [hegemony cannot exist among great powers with weak
markets]{.underline}; these inherently expansionist states live in
constant fear and therefore normally balance against the strongest state
and its allies. Hegemony can exist only among market-oriented powers,
because only they care about global order. Yet, [there can be [no
competition for leadership among market powers, because they always
agree with the goal of their strongest]{.mark} member]{.underline}
(currently the United States) [[to preserve and protect the global
order]{.mark} based on the principle of self-determination]{.underline}.
If another commercial power, such as a rising China, were to overtake
the United States, the world would take little notice, because the new
leading power would largely agree with the global rules promoted and
enforced by its predecessor. Vladimir Putin's Russia, on the other hand,
seeks to create chaos around the world. Most other powers, having
market-oriented economies, continue to abide by the hegemony of the
United States despite its relative economic decline since the end of
World War II.

#### Mearsheimer agrees

Because [[economic power is central to military
power]{.underline}]{.mark}, realist theory rejects the idea that states
can be unconcerned with relative gains. Many influential scholars of
power politics recognize, however, that factors other than relative
power can inform states about whether another state is a threat.
Arguably, the behavior of a state says more about whether it is a threat
than do its economic and military capabilities. [[Even]{.mark} John
[Mearsheimer]{.mark}, considered to be the first theorist to postulate
"offensive" realism, has [asserted]{.mark} that "[the prospects for
cooperation among market democracies are
'excellent.]{.mark}']{.underline}

### 1AR -- Sustainability -- AT: Debt

#### Financial reasons for unsustainability are wrong. 

Carla **Norrlof 16**, Ph.D. in IR, Discipline Representative of
Political Science at the University of Toronto; and William Wohlforth,

strategy self-defeating? Deep engagement, military spending and
sovereign debt;" *Conflict Management and Peace Science*, Vol. 36, No.
3, <https://doi.org/10.1177/0738894216674953>

[Retrenchment proponents see **American military spending** as
contributing to the **growth** of **public debt**]{.underline}3 [and the
country's **relative economic decline**]{.underline}, [and they
argue]{.underline} that as it approaches its credit limit, [the US
should **cut military spending**]{.underline} and act preemptively to
forestall steeper decline and even bankruptcy. Some [retrenchment
supporters also fear that **negative feedback** between **military
overstretch** and **economic decline** will eventually put]{.underline}
America's coercive [**hegemony at risk** because **economic might i**s
the **wellspring** of **military might**]{.underline} (Calleo, 1982;
Chace, 1981; Kennedy, 1987a, 1987b; MacDonald and Parent, 2011). In
short, [retrenchment proponents agree that reducing military spending is
an **economic necessity**]{.underline}, although they disagree about the
extent to which the US should reduce its spending and overseas presence
as well as the desirability of sustaining military primacy.

This argument is noteworthy not only because of its centrality to the
retrenchment argument, but also because academic defenders of deep
engagement have as **[yet]{.underline}** no direct response. Scholars
and policymakers who oppose retrenchment maintain that [**American
military dominance** has produced **significant economic
benefits**]{.underline} and warn that reductions in military spending
will reduce these benefits (Brooks, et al., 2013; Brooks and Wohlforth,
2016; Gottlieb, 2012; Kagan, 2012; Sestanovich, 2014). Three main
arguments point to such benefits. First, according to a research program
closely connected with the work of Robert Gilpin and Stephen Krasner,
[**military power** **underwrites** an **open economic
order**]{.underline}. In a series of books, Gilpin and Krasner explain
the logic and evidence for hegemonic orders that rest in part on an
outsized global military role (Gilpin, 1975; Gilpin, 1981, 1987, 2001;
Krasner, 1978). [A **dominant military power** that equates its own
interest with **expanding economic globalization** benefits from
providing a **stable political context** that makes economic exchange
more **secure** and **predictable**]{.underline} (Brooks, et al., 2013;
Brooks and Wohlforth, 2016; Norrlof, 2008, 2010).

Second, [**military primacy** generates **other** direct benefits, such
as **official support** for the **hegemon's currency**; sustained
**capital inflows** during times of **distress**; protection of
residents' **foreign investments**; and **economic contributions** to
the hegemon's **military activities**, including economic transfers
through **basing fees**]{.underline} (Beckley, 2011; Helleiner, 2008;
James, 2009; McNamara, 2008, Norrlof, 2008, 2010; Posen, 2008).

[Third, the **preeminent military power** leverages security to extract
**economic favors** from allies in **exchange for
protection.**]{.underline} As a background condition, [security allows
the hegemonic power to **win concessions** in **economic** and **trade
negotiations**]{.underline} (Ikenberry, 2011; Mastanduno, 2009; Norrlof,
2010). [Economic agreements **flow** from **the barrel of a
gun.**]{.underline}

### 1AR -- Sustainability -- AT: Polarization/Domestic Divisions

#### Internal problems [don't preclude]{.underline} US leadership, and retrenching [wouldn't solve them]{.underline}. 

Hal **Brands 21**, Bloomberg Opinion columnist, the Henry Kissinger

International Studies, and a scholar at the American Enterprise

Heal\", *Bloomberg*,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-09/trump-fueled-u-s-dysfunction-won-t-be-cured-by-isolationist-foreign-policy

[The severity of the U.S. predicament has led some analysts to the
conclusion that Washington must **dial back its global ambitions** until
it conquers its internal demons]{.underline}. As Emma Ashford put it in
Foreign Policy, "Ambitious foreign-policy goals are completely out of
step with the realities of the country's domestic political and economic
dysfunction."

**[That's misguided]{.underline}**. No true U.S. ally is advocating that
Washington turn its back on the world (although many presumably worry
about it), and for good reason. [It's not as though the need for
American engagement has become **any less pressing**]{.underline}: [As
we have seen during **Covid**]{.underline}-19, [the likely alternatives
to constructive U.S. leadership are a **breakdown of international
cooperation** on pandemics and other issues and a **vacuum** that less
principled, less democratic actors such as **China** **will
fill.**]{.underline}

Richard Nixon, another corrupt president who governed at another time of
alarming domestic and geopolitical turmoil, warned that "if America were
to become a dropout in assuming the responsibility for defining peace
and freedom in the world ... the rest of the world would live in
terror." Nixon's own transgressions notwithstanding, [a post-American
world seems unlikely to be **any more stable** or **benign**
today.]{.underline}

[The **premise of retrenchment is flawed** in other ways, too. Unless
foreign policy is a principal cause of America's divisions and
injustices, as it was during Vietnam, then it's **not immediately
evident** that a **less ambitious foreign policy** would help
**address** those problems. Withdrawing from Europe]{.underline}'s
strategic affairs [after World War I didn't allow the U.S. to avoid a
**wave of nativism** and **racism** in the 1920s or the **profound
polarization** of the Great Depression.]{.underline}

One can plausibly argue that the relationship runs in the other
direction. During the Cold War, America's commitment to combating Soviet
influence globally helped motivate it to address its worst domestic sin,
state-sponsored segregation.

Finally, [domestic perfection has **never been a prerequisite** for
**purposeful international action**]{.underline}. [The U.S. protected
the world from aggressive autocracy in two global wars **despite** being
**a deeply flawed society** that fell far short of its founding ideals.
It contained the Soviet Union, thereby supporting an **unprecedented
flourishing of democracy** worldwide, while **struggling** with issues
from **racial injustice** to **economic turmoil** to **bitter political
disputes**]{.underline}. [Had Americans instead insisted on resolving
domestic problems **before** acting internationally, the result would
have been a **disaster for liberalism everywhere**]{.underline} ---
including, ultimately, in America itself.

[The U.S.]{.underline} should emerge from the Trump era with greater
humility about its own shortcomings and the dangers they pose to its
diplomacy as well as its democracy. Yet it [cannot fall into despair
about its ability to shape a healthy world. The **domestic reckoning**
America requires should be seen as a **complement** to the American
leadership the world still needs --- **not as a
substitute.**]{.underline}

That the first attempt was a costly failure should be beyond dispute.
[[Instead of advancing, democracy has been in retreat around the world
for more than a decade]{.mark}---including in the United States
itself---[and U.S.-led efforts at regime change have led]{.mark} not to
thriving democracies but [to failed states and costly occupations.
Hyperglobalization]{.mark} under U.S. auspices produced a grave
financial crisis in 2008, politically painful job displacement in a
number of sectors, and [helped trigger a **wide-ranging populist
backlash**. NATO enlargement helped poison relations with Russia, and
policies such as dual containment]{.mark} in the Persian Gulf [inspired
anti-U.S. terrorism,]{.mark} including the 9/11 attacks and all the
negative consequences that flowed from that event. [The end result of
these developments has been]{.mark} a partial retreat from
globalization, the emergence of would-be autocrats in Hungary, Poland,
and even in the United States, and **[revitalized
authoritarianism]{.mark}** in many other places.]{.underline} Given
where we are today, does it matter whether a more sophisticated version
of liberal hegemony might have succeeded? In fact, this issue is of
paramount importance, because [[plenty of]{.underline}]{.mark} people
are still convinced that trying to create a U.S.-led, liberal world
order was the right goal and that the United States just needs to learn
from past mistakes and do it better and smarter in the future.
[[Defenders include unrepentant hawks]{.underline}]{.mark} such as Eric
Edelman and Ray Takeyh, [who think what the Middle East needs is even
more U.S.-led regime change]{.underline}, but also liberal academics
such as G. John Ikenberry and Daniel Deudney, who believe the liberal
order remains surprisingly resilient. Other proponents of this view are
dedicated policy wonks such as Jake Sullivan, who thinks the problem is
not the United States' basic strategy but rather the fact that Americans
are increasingly skeptical of it, and one sees similar impulses in the
writings of Hal Brands, Peter Feaver, and other defenders of an
expansive U.S. role. If former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden wins the
presidential election in November---and, to be clear, I hope he
does---the apostles of U.S. primacy and its "indispensable" global role
will be back in the saddle, and we are likely to see at least a partial
attempt to turn the clock back to the halcyon days when the United
States was actively trying to create a global liberal order.

Does this argument mean that liberal hegemony was the right course after
all, and that a more sophisticated version should be adopted [[should
the United States ever find itself in a position of primacy
again]{.underline}?]{.mark} I don't think so. The flaw in the
counterfactual described above should be obvious. It assumes that if
policymakers in previous years had perfect knowledge of the results of
their actions, then they could infallibly pick the right course of
action at each critical point. Armed with perfect foresight, for
example, former U.S. President George W. Bush would not have chosen to
invade Iraq in 2003, or perhaps he would have devoted a lot more time
and effort into preparing for the post-Saddam occupation. [Yet [even
perfect knowledge]{.mark} about what went wrong [would not guarantee
success the second time around]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, even when we
know what mistakes to avoid, there may not be any course of action that
would yield a successful outcome. [The **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark} very [powerful]{.mark}, wealthy, and
secure, [but some]{.mark} [tasks]{.mark} may simply be beyond its means
and [outside the limits of its understanding. Trying to use military
force to transform deeply divided societies into liberal democracies
seems to be one of them]{.mark}.]{.underline} Second, if the United
States had taken a significantly different course of action at various
critical points in the recent past, then history would have headed in a
different direction and U.S. leaders would have faced a wholly different
set of choices whose results could not be known in advance. [In other
words, the lessons drawn from events as they actually occurred may not
help the United States decide what to do once history is following a
different path]{.underline}. Most importantly, [even [liberal hegemony
lite]{.mark} entails a lot of [complicated social
engineering]{.mark}.]{.underline} By definition, a [[liberal]{.mark}
world [order]{.mark}]{.underline} is one where certain key political
principles---democracy; sovereignty; low barriers to trade, investment,
and travel; rule of law within multilateral institutions; and individual
rights) are nearly universal. [But we live in a world where these
[values are not universally embraced]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Democracies
have never been a majority, and millions of people think]{.mark}
security, sovereignty, cultural values, national autonomy, and [other
political goals are more important]{.mark}---which means that [trying to
get others to embrace **democracy requires considerable pressure and
increases the risk of political instability.** Such efforts inevitably
trigger local resentments of various kinds]{.mark}, especially in a
world where nationalism and other forms of local identity make people
resentful and suspicious of even well-intentioned foreign interference.
Furthermore, [the more far-reaching the changes occurring among any
group of people, the more unpredictable the results will be and the more
unintended consequences are bound to arise.]{.mark} Even progressive
political change creates winners and losers, and the latter won't
necessarily accept their fates with forbearance. Instead, they [**may
take up arms to try to regain their former positions**, thereby creating
the sort of resistance that helped defeat U.S. efforts to promote a
liberal order in the past]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if future
policymakers avoided all of the errors made between 1992 and 2016 (to
say nothing of the blunders U.S. President Donald Trump has made since
then), we may be confident they will mishandle some of the unforeseen
developments that are bound to arise on their watch.

### 2NC -- Kagan Wrong

#### Kagan misunderstands the international system

Christopher **Preble, 12** (Co-director of the New American Engagement
Initiative in the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, PhD in
history from Temple University; "The Critique of Pure Kagan"; The
National Interest No. 120 (July/August 2012), pp. 70-79 (10 pages);
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/42896468>) //LVL

[[Kagan\'s fundamental flawed misconception analysis begins about with a
fundamental misconception about the international system and the
relations of states within it. His worldview perceives two types of
countries:]{.underline}]{.mark} those that are con- genitally incapable
of dealing with urgent security challenges on their borders or in their
respective regions; and a crafty, rapacious few who are forever scheming
to intimidate, disrupt or simply devour the hapless and the helpless.
Within this dichotomy, however, is a third sort of country, the only one
of its kind. The United States enjoys a privileged place in the world
order, explains Kagan. Its power is unthreatening because it is
relatively distant from others. And, according to Kagan, the costs of
this power are easily borne by the wealthiest country in the world.
Kagans world order \"is as fragile as it is unique,\" and \"preserving
\[it\] requires constant American leadership and constant American
commitment.\" The message today is consistent with that from sixteen
years ago when he and William Kristol first made the case for what they
called \"benevolent global hegemony.\" [In other respects, [however, the
story that emerges from The World America Made is subtly
different]{.mark}.]{.underline} Anticipating a rising tide of pessimism
and gloominess within the American electorate, Kagan at times resorts to
the tone of a pep talk. Whereas he once highlighted the \"present
dangers\" confronting the United States (in a volume coedited with
Kristol, published in 2000), he now says the world today isn\'t as
dangerous as it once was - during the Cold War, for example, or at other
periods in American history. Looking ahead, he says, China has its own
set of problems, is unlikely to make a bid for regional hegemony and is
unlikely to succeed if it tries. Likewise, we shouldn\'t be overly
frightened by Chinas growing economic power, Kagan explains, which will
lag well behind that of the United States for years. Other global
challenges are more modest still. [[The object of these]{.mark}
relatively optimistic [assessments is to convince Americans that they
can manage to hold on to their position of global dominance for many
years without bankrupting themselves financially or exhausting
themselves emotionally.]{.mark} This line of argument cuts against
Kagans other claims, however, both in this volume and elsewhere, that
the United States should spend even more on its military and that

Thucydides's Trap is a term I coined a decade ago to make vivid
Thucydides's insight. [[Thucydides's Trap is the dangerous dynamic that
occurs when a rising power (like]{.underline}]{.mark} Athens, Germany a
century ago, or [[China]{.mark} today) [threatens to displace a ruling
power (like]{.mark}]{.underline} Sparta, Great Britain, or [[the
U.S]{.mark}. today]{.underline}). In these conditions, both parties
become especially vulnerable to third-party provocations or even
accidents. Remember 1914, when the assassination of an archduke sparked
a fire that ended up burning down the houses of all the great states of
Europe. [[In]{.mark} the dangerous [Thucydidean dynamic,
misperceptions]{.mark} are [magnified, miscalculations multiplied, and
risks of escalation amplified. Extraneous events that would otherwise be
manageable compel one or the other to react, triggering a vicious cycle
of reactions that can drag them into a war that neither wanted.]{.mark}
As Thucydides explains, [this]{.mark} dangerous dynamic [is driven
by]{.mark} three factors: [material reality, psychology, and politics.
At the material level, China]{.mark} really is [rising and encroaching
on]{.mark} positions and [prerogatives Americans have come to believe
are naturally ours]{.mark}. Many Americans see this as an assault on who
we are---since for us, USA means number one. Others are still "China
deniers"---refusing to acknowledge that China could be number one in any
race that matters. [Psychology combines perceptions and misperceptions
with emotions and identity---]{.mark}often [producing]{.mark} what
Thucydides called ["fear" in the ruling power and "arrogance" in the
rising power.]{.mark}]{.underline} (And as the Greeks taught us, beyond
fear lies paranoia; beyond arrogance, hubris.) As my colleague Joe Nye
has pointed out, as rivals come to see the other as an enemy, [**[this
can become a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies]{.mark}** in [which
whatever]{.mark} either does is [seen by the other as a hostile attempt
to displace it or hold it down.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Conclusion

Accurately [assessing the durability of US **geo-economic power**
requires]{.underline} accurately [assessing the mechanisms that
**produce** and **maintain that power**]{.underline}. Susan Strange
(1989) identified four main structural sources of power but without much
specificity as to their mechanisms. Here I have tried to show the
centrality of IPRs for mechanisms sustaining dollar centrality and
control over global commodity chains. **[Dollar
centrality]{.underline}** in the international monetary system [allows
the United States]{.underline} as an economy and, more specifically, US
firms [to escape constraints that balance of payments deficits impose on
weaker countries]{.underline} (Cohen, 1998). In a world with free
markets and minimal financial repression, US current account deficits
would disappear through currency depreciation and capital flight.

In our world, however, [**successful late developers** have
institutionally rooted **domestic demand deficiency** generating
persistent current **account surpluses**]{.underline}. Their [addiction
to **external demand** means they accumulate excess export revenues that
in turn require the creation or existence of counterpart
assets]{.underline}. Only the United States can provide those assets in
sufficient quantity and quality (Schwartz, 2009). US firms accounted for
over half of global equity market capitalization in 2020, with one-third
of this attributable to the top 30 IPR-based firms by market
capitalization. Other assets, like Federal debt, mortgage-backed
securities, and real estate, are all ultimately funded by the economic
activity that large US firms generate. [**IPRs** and the profits they
generate are thus **central** to **US global power**]{.underline},
barring fundamental changes wrought by COVID-19, other external shocks,
or US domestic political chaos stemming from the Trump administration.

Of **[these]{.underline}**, the first and the last [are likely to
combine to **diminish US heg**emonic power. The initially incompetent US
response to COVID]{.underline}19 surely [will shake faith in
**dollar-denominated assets**]{.underline}, particularly if US growth
falters relative to European or Chinese growth. More narrowly,
[government responses to COVID]{.underline}-19 [will cause or force many
supply chains **back on-shore**]{.underline}, particularly for
health-related commodities. In this context, [it is easy to see the
**erosion** of **pharma**ceutical and other **IPRs** as states
**override patents** to **maximize production** of critical drugs and
equipment. This might culminate]{.underline} in a 1930s-style retreat
[into **continental monetary and trade blocs**]{.underline},
necessitating a painful adjustment of surplus economies' domestic
political arrangements. Avoiding this requires global reflation and
recovery based on continued US current account deficits, and thus the
export of "assets" backed by IPRs, which might [**sustain US
heg**emony]{.underline}. But this [would]{.underline} in turn [require
expanding the US welfare state to compensate]{.underline} the [losers
from **perpetual current account deficits**, and this seems
**increasingly unlikely** given the **current balance of political
power** in the US political system.]{.underline}

The [horrifying images of desperate Afghans trying to get out of
Kabul]{.underline} after the Western-backed government collapsed in
August [seemed to signify a major juncture in world history, as
**America turned away from the world**]{.underline}. Yet in truth, the
end of the American era had come much earlier. [The long-term sources of
American **weakness** and **decline** are more **domestic**]{.underline}
than international. The country will remain a great power for many
years, but just [how influential it will be depends on its ability to
fix its **internal problems**]{.underline}, rather than its foreign
policy.

The peak period of American hegemony lasted less than 20 years, from the
fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 to the financial crisis of 2007-09. The
country was dominant in many domains of power---military, economic,
political and cultural. The height of American hubris was the invasion
of Iraq in 2003, when it hoped to remake not just Iraq and Afghanistan
(invaded two years before), but the whole Middle East. America
overestimated the effectiveness of military power to bring about deep
political change, even as it underestimated the impact of its
free-market economic model on global finance. The decade ended with its
troops bogged down in two counterinsurgency wars, and a financial crisis
that accentuated the inequalities American-led globalisation had brought
about.

Termites in the floorboards

[The degree of unipolarity in this period has been **rare in
history**]{.underline}, and [the world has been reverting to a more
normal state of multipolarity ever since, with **China**, **Russia**,
**India**, **Europe** and other centres **gaining power** relative to
**America**]{.underline}. Afghanistan's ultimate effect on geopolitics
is likely to be small: America survived an earlier, humiliating defeat
when it withdrew from Vietnam in 1975, but regained its dominance within
little more than a decade. [The much bigger challenge to America's
**global standing** is **domestic**]{.underline}.

[American society is **deeply polarised**, and has found it
**difficult** to find **consensus** on virtually
**anything**]{.underline}. This **[polarisation]{.underline}** started
over conventional policy issues like taxes and abortion, but
[has]{.underline} since **[metastasised]{.underline}** [into a bitter
fight over **cultural identity**]{.underline}. Normally a big external
threat such as a global pandemic should be the occasion for citizens to
rally around a common response. But the **[covid]{.underline}**-19
crisis [served]{.underline} rather [to **deepen America's
divisions**]{.underline}, with social distancing, mask-wearing and
vaccinations being seen not as public-health measures but as political
markers.[These conflicts have spread to all aspects of life, from sport
to the brands of consumer products that red and blue Americans
buy.]{.underline}

**[Polarisation has affected foreign policy directly]{.underline}**.
During Barack Obama's presidency, [Republicans took a hawkish stance and
scolded Democrats for the Russian "reset" and alleged naivety regarding
Vladimir Putin]{.underline}. Donald [Trump turned the tables by
**embracing Mr. Putin**]{.underline}, and today roughly half of
[Republicans believe that the Democrats constitute a **bigger threat**
to the American way of life than **Russia** does.]{.underline}

There is more apparent consensus regarding China: both Republicans and
Democrats agree it is a threat to democratic values. But this only
carries America so far. A far greater test for American foreign policy
than Afghanistan will be Taiwan, if it comes under direct Chinese
attack. Will the United States be willing to sacrifice its sons and
daughters on behalf of that island's independence? Or indeed, would it
risk military conflict with Russia should the latter invade Ukraine?
These are serious questions with no easy answers, but a reasoned debate
about American national interest will probably be conducted primarily
through the lens of how it affects the partisan struggle.

The biggest policy debacle of President Joe Biden's administration in
its first year has been its failure to plan adequately for the rapid
collapse of Afghanistan. Mr Biden has suggested that withdrawal was
necessary in order to focus on meeting the bigger challenges from Russia
and China. I hope he is serious about this. Mr Obama was never
successful in making a "pivot" to Asia because America remained focused
on counterinsurgency in the Middle East. In 2022, the administration
needs to redeploy both resources and the attention of policymakers to
deter geopolitical rivals and engage with allies.

[The United States is **not likely** to regain its earlier **hegemonic
status**, **nor** should it **aspire to**]{.underline}. What it can hope
for is to sustain, with like-minded countries, a world order friendly to
democratic values. Whether it can do this will depend on recovering a
sense of national identity and purpose at home.
