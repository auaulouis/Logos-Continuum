[Institutional Challenges Facing NATO]{.underline} NATO as an
institution [continues to face a myriad of challenges trying to adapt to
a digital era]{.underline}. NCI Agency's General Manager vision "NATO's
Digital Endeavour" goes a long way in articulating these challenges and
implementing solutions through a phased approach and help bring NATO
amongst the digital natives.16 [Some core issues are still likely to
hamper any progress if not addressed]{.underline}. First, if we look at
a multinational security institution consisting of [29 member nations
which have different interests]{.underline} and pace of technological
innovation, [the gap between the USA and its Allies in Europe is still
prevalent]{.underline}.17 Change and progress will happen but is likely
to be slower as large and traditional multinational security
institutions are not driven by the same business models as corporate
organizations in the private sector. Furthermore, [digital
transformation should be seen as a journey rather than an end state for
it to be successfully implemented]{.underline}. Second, [adopting an
end-to-end approach in any digital endeavour **requires** partnerships
and agreements between **public and private sectors** as ownership of
digital assets are fragmented across the **civil-military**
spectrum]{.underline}. Finally, [the private sector]{.underline},
especially small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups [have a lot
to offer in developing]{.underline} niche, [cutting-edge]{.underline},
[disruptive technology]{.underline}. Working with next-generation
technology can bring information superiority for the defence sector to
another level. Still, large institutions like NATO remain a black box
for these industries to work with.

[What happens when an alliance's competitors quickly improve their
technology and capabilities to place the alliance at increased
risk]{.underline}? The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}) [addressed this]{.underline} dilemma [during a
recent summit in Brussels]{.underline}. At the summit, the North
Atlantic Council built upon NATO's 2030 strategic outline and presented
targets for increased technological collaboration to counter growing
threats from Russia, China, and non-state actors. [While NATO's
scientific and technical superiority has historically allowed it to
outpace competitors, its adversaries are quickly closing the
gap]{.underline}. [NATO members still hold advantages in their
development of new technologies]{.underline}. According to the Global
Innovation Index, seven of the top ten most innovative countries
globally are part of NATO, while the other three are key NATO partners.
Even so, [NATO can do more to harness the alliance's combined
technological prowess to better compete and win in a future
conflict]{.underline}. [As China seeks to become the world's innovation
leader and Russia continues to undermine the alliance's
security]{.underline}, [NATO will need to out-innovate its competitors
and prepare for an uncertain future]{.underline}. Four areas where [NATO
can focus on]{.underline} improving its competitive edge are developing
its formal organizations, [increasing public and private sector
collaboration]{.underline}, harnessing [and countering]{.underline}
Emerging Disruptive Technologies ([EDTs]{.underline}), and improving
conventional military equipment. [NATO must maintain its relative lead
in technology sectors]{.underline} to defend its people and enhance its
long-term strategic position. [Improving science and
technology]{.underline} (S&T) [innovation will increase alliance
collaboration, strengthen public and private sector cooperation, counter
hybrid threats, deter adversaries, and harden defenses against
attacks]{.underline}. [NATO's effectiveness]{.underline} in the future
will heavily [depend on its ability to maintain]{.underline} and improve
[its science and technology capabilities]{.underline}. A Changing
Environment The global geopolitical situation has changed significantly
over the past decade. Although NATO remains the world's most successful
and powerful alliance, [China and other adversaries are quickly reducing
NATO's military and scientific advantages]{.underline}. In just the past
year, China raised its defense budget by 6.8 percent and continues to
build global power projection capabilities in addition to its regional
defenses. As part of what some call a Fourth Industrial
Revolution,[Beijing is rapidly investing in AI, biotechnology, robotics,
and other new technologies]{.underline}. [Russia is also developing new
technologies]{.underline}, especially in areas where it can exploit
NATO's weaknesses. Russia's ballistic missiles can reach anywhere in
Europe, and Russia has placed renewed emphasis on improved missile
technology, [such as recent hypersonic advances]{.underline}. Russia has
built a robust Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) network on Europe's
eastern flank while simultaneously expanding military capabilities into
its Arctic region. [Both areas pose direct security challenges to
NATO]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} the alliance's [S&T efforts can
help mitigate]{.underline}. Over the past decade, [NATO has recognized
the need for increased innovation]{.underline} and technological
[advancements]{.underline}. In 2012, the alliance created the Science
and Technology Organization, taking on the former roles of the NATO
Research and Technology Organization, including its executive function.
It also incorporated the former NATO Undersea Research Center,
established the NATO Chief Scientist position, and outlined the unified
governance of NATO S&T. In 2020, NATO created an Innovation Board and an
Advisory Group on Emerging and Disruptive Technologies to provide
external advice to NATO on optimizing its innovation efforts. At the
2021 Brussels Summit, [NATO agreed to launch]{.underline} a
civil-military Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic
([DIANA]{.underline}) [to]{.underline} "[foster transatlantic
cooperation on critical technologies, promote interoperability and
harness civilian innovation by engaging with academia and the private
sector]{.underline}, including start-ups." There are [plans to establish
a NATO Innovation Fund]{.underline} (NIF), where allies "can support
start-ups working on dual-use emerging and disruptive technologies in
areas key to Allied security." [These are steps in the right
direction]{.underline}, but NATO can do more. Expanding Technological
Organizations [In conjunction with its newest additions, the DIANA and
NIF, NATO can expand the capacities of its Science and Technology
Organization]{.underline} (STO) [to boost research]{.underline} and
development (R&D) [in]{.underline} artificial intelligence
([AI]{.underline}), missile and missile defense technology, [space,
cyber, and other EDTs]{.underline}. The STO is the world's largest
defense and security research forum, employing over 6,000 scientists
from allied nations. However, the STO does not turn NATO defense
spending into tangible products or equipment for the alliance. [NATO
could use the STO to streamline research and product
development]{.underline}, ensuring all allies are working toward a
common goal and not spending resources on identical R&D. For instance,
each country could allocate part of its defense budget to develop
standardized systems like integrated air, missile, and cyber defenses.
[Whether using the STO or DIANA as its main innovation driver, NATO must
continue developing its formal institutions to harness solutions that
benefit the entire alliance]{.underline} and help it achieve its three
core tasks of collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative
security. [Public and Private Sector Collaboration]{.underline} The
Brussels Summit Communique also recommends continuing the R&D of AI
technologies and identifying alliance gaps in this critical focus area.
[Many]{.underline} of these [advancements occur in the private
sector]{.underline}, and [NATO must find ways to use those technologies
for the alliance]{.underline}. The U.S. National Security Commission on
Artificial Intelligence's March 2021 report states that AI-enabled
warfare is part of the near future. While the United States and NATO are
currently ahead in these technologies, other countries will soon pass
them unless they increase their R&D efforts. In addition to boosting
research through the STO and DIANA, [NATO can streamline the acquisition
of commercial sector AI-focused technologies for national security
purposes]{.underline} and [create an alliance-wide process that acquires
emerging technologies from the private sector]{.underline}. [The rapidly
changing nature of emerging technologies]{.underline} and the quantity
and depth of innovation seen [in the private sector require an
acquisitions system that]{.underline} is not only fast but [allows for
the rapid integration of updated product iterations and
innovations]{.underline}. Autocratic competitors excel in private and
public sector integration, given the nature of their systems. [Improving
its ability to apply privately developed technology]{.underline} for
military uses rapidly [will ensure that NATO retains its competitive
edge]{.underline} over its predominantly autocratic adversaries.
Harnessing and Countering Emerging Disruptive Technologies While
emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs) touch all aspects of life
and present exciting opportunities for the alliance, they also present
threats. Many of NATO's adversaries use EDTs against alliance personnel
and infrastructure, such as recent cyberattacks targeting Polish
politicians and the Colonial Pipeline. [Enhancing its innovation
processes will allow NATO to improve its military technology across all
domains and boost its deterrence]{.underline} and defense capabilities.
[NATO could then better deter Russian and Chinese hybrid threats in
cyber, space, electronic warfare, and information domains]{.underline}.
For instance, NATO can use its forthcoming Cyber Command to take
collective action and demonstrate cyberspace thresholds that will result
in unified offensive cyber or conventional responses if crossed by its
adversaries. By strengthening its cyber abilities and adding new
capabilities, NATO can deter adversaries in the information space and
take the offensive against them. NATO would then rob Russia and China of
success in areas where they currently excel, and better protect the
alliance's people and infrastructure. Conventional Military Improvements
NATO can also use its technological advancements to improve its
conventional military capabilities. One critical area where NATO must
focus is its integrated air and missile defense. Russian nuclear weapons
can reach anywhere in Europe and NATO cannot adequately defend against
new technologies like swarm warfare or hypersonic missiles. Two of
NATO's high-visibility modernization programs focus on combating air and
missile threats, but NATO must do more to combat emerging and future
adversary weapons. As the United States continues R&D on a Patriot
missile system replacement, NATO countries could ingrate into its supply
chain, like that of the F-35 aircraft, or develop complementary systems
that fill gaps in the U.S. air defense system's effectiveness. The
current NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defense system uses mainly
American-made radars and missiles stationed in NATO countries. While
effective, NATO could harden its defenses by fielding European-developed
systems that are compatible with current and future U.S. systems, thus
expanding its anti-access area denial (A2/AD) bubble while
simultaneously reducing air and missile threats. Furthermore, the
alliance can conduct more combined military exercises to test new
equipment and boost unit proficiency. [Improving its deterrence and
defenses in critical areas will reduce the military threats from NATO's
adversaries]{.underline} as they seek to sow division and destabilize
the alliance. [When it couples military advances with other areas of
technological improvement, NATO gains the best chance of maintaining its
competitive edge]{.underline}. [NATO will still need to overcome
bureaucratic hurdles]{.underline} across its 30-member alliance. As
Nicholas Nelson of the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) notes,
[for the DIANA and NIF "to succeed, they must address authority and
budget concerns, and then bring in the right personnel to lead and staff
them]{.underline}." Even so, NATO is taking the proper steps to improve
its scientific and technological capabilities. Its strategic documents
reflect the importance it is placing in these areas. [By creating new
institutions, NATO is setting the foundation for further development and
expanded capabilities]{.underline}. Given the threats that adversaries
pose to the alliance, maintaining and improving its scientific and
technological prowess will be vital to NATO's future success.
Strengthening these areas will boost military effectiveness, deterrence,
and defense and enhance [private and public cooperative
advancements]{.underline}. It [will]{.underline} ultimately [give the
alliance more strategic flexibility]{.underline} while improving NATO's
defenses in areas beyond the military, such as energy and cybersecurity
in the private sector. By continuing to out-innovate its competitors,
NATO will protect its people and infrastructure, and ensure that the
alliance remains prepared to combat any challenges from Russia or China.

#### Adversary innovation-lead causes nuclear war

disruptive technology cause nuclear war?,\" Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists,
<https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/will-disruptive-technology-cause-nuclear-war/>)

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason [why new technology might cause **nuclear
conflict**: by upending the existing balance of power among
nuclear-armed states]{.underline}. This latter concern is more probable
and dangerous and demands an immediate policy response. For more than 70
years, the world has avoided major power conflict, and many attribute
this era of peace to nuclear weapons. In situations of mutually assured
destruction (MAD), neither side has an incentive to start a conflict
because doing so will only result in its own annihilation. The key to
this model of deterrence is the maintenance of secure second-strike
capabilities---the ability to absorb an enemy nuclear attack and respond
with a devastating counterattack. Recently analysts have begun to worry,
however, that [new strategic military technologies may make it possible
for a state to conduct]{.underline} a [successful first strike on an
enemy]{.underline}. For example, Chinese colleagues have complained to
me in Track II dialogues that the United States may decide to launch a
sophisticated cyberattack against Chinese nuclear command and control,
essentially turning off China's nuclear forces. Then, Washington will
follow up with a massive strike with conventional cruise and hypersonic
missiles to destroy China's nuclear weapons. Finally, if any Chinese
forces happen to survive, the United States can simply mop up China's
ragged retaliatory strike with advanced missile defenses. China will be
disarmed and US nuclear weapons will still be sitting on the shelf,
untouched. If the United States, or any other state acquires such a
first-strike capability, then the logic of MAD would be undermined.
Washington may be tempted to launch a nuclear first strike. Or China may
choose instead to use its nuclear weapons early in a conflict before
they can be wiped out---the so-called "use 'em or lose 'em" problem.
According to this logic, therefore, the appropriate policy response
would be to ban outright or control any new weapon systems that might
threaten second-strike capabilities. This way of thinking about new
technology and stability, however, is open to question. Would any US
president truly decide to launch a massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear
attack because he or she thought s/he could get away with it? And why
does it make sense for the country in the inferior position, in this
case China, to intentionally start a nuclear war that it will almost
certainly lose? More important, this conceptualization of how new
technology affects stability is too narrow, focused exclusively on how
new military technologies might be used against nuclear forces directly.
Rather, [we should think]{.underline} more [broadly about how new
technology might affect global politics, and]{.underline}, for this, [it
is helpful to turn to scholarly international relations
theory]{.underline}. The dominant theory of the causes of war in the
academy is [the "[bargaining]{.mark} model of war."]{.underline} This
theory [[identifies rapid shifts in the balance of power as a **primary
cause of conflict**]{.mark}. International politics]{.underline} often
[presents states with conflicts that they can settle through peaceful
bargaining, but when bargaining breaks down, war results. [Shifts in the
balance of power]{.mark} are problematic because **they [undermine
effective bargaining]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After all, why agree to a
deal today if your bargaining position will be stronger tomorrow? And, a
[clear understanding of the military balance of power can contribute to
peace]{.underline}. (Why start a war you are likely to lose?) [But
shifts in the balance of power muddy understandings of which states have
the advantage]{.underline}. You may see where this is going. [[New
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [threaten to [create]{.mark}
potentially **[destabilizing shifts in]{.mark} the [balance of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For decades, [stability in]{.underline}
Europe and [Asia has been supported by US military power.]{.underline}
In recent years, however, [the balance of power in Asia has begun to
shift, as China has increased its military capabilities]{.underline}.
Already, [[Beijing has become]{.mark} **more [assertive]{.mark}** in the
region, [claiming]{.mark} contested [territory]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the South China Sea. And the results of Russia's military modernization
have been on full display in its ongoing intervention in Ukraine.
Moreover, [China may have the [lead]{.mark} over the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[in emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies [that could be decisive for]{.mark} the future of
military acquisitions and [warfare, including 3D printing]{.mark},
hypersonic [missiles, quantum computing, 5G]{.mark} wireless
connectivity, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} artificial intelligence
([[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}). And Russian President Vladimir Putin is
building new unmanned vehicles while ominously declaring, "Whoever leads
in AI will rule the world." [[If China]{.underline}]{.mark} or Russia
[[are able to incorporate new tech]{.mark}nologies into their militaries
[before the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, then [this [could]{.mark} lead to the
kind of rapid shift in the balance of power that often [cause]{.mark}s
[war.]{.mark} If [Beijing]{.mark} believes emerging technologies provide
it with a newfound, local military advantage over the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, for example, [it
[may]{.mark} be]{.underline} more [willing]{.underline} than previously
[to **[initiate conflict over Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And if
Putin thinks new tech has strengthened his hand, he may be more tempted
to launch a Ukraine-style invasion of a NATO member.
[[Either]{.underline}]{.mark} scenario [[could bring]{.mark} these
nuclear [powers into]{.mark} direct [conflict with the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [and
once nuclear armed states are at war, [there is]{.mark} an [inherent
risk of nuclear conflict through limited]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}
strategies, **nuclear [brinkmanship]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} **simple
[accident]{.mark}** or **inadvertent escalation**. This framing of the
problem leads to a different set of policy implications. The concern
is]{.underline} not simply technologies that threaten to undermine
nuclear second-strike capabilities directly, but, rather, any
[[tech]{.mark}nologies that [can result in a meaningful shift in the
broader balance of power]{.mark}]{.underline}. And the solution is not
to preserve second-strike capabilities, but to preserve prevailing power
balances more broadly. When it comes to new technology, this means that
[the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should seek to
maintain an innovation edge]{.underline}. Washington should also work
with other states, including its nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new
set of arms control and nonproliferation agreements and export controls
to deny these newer and potentially destabilizing technologies to
potentially hostile states. These are no easy tasks, but t[he
[consequences of Washington **losing**]{.mark} **the race for
[tech]{.mark}**nological **[superiority]{.mark}**]{.underline} to its
autocratic challengers just [[might mean **nuclear
Armageddon**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Solvency

#### Public-private partnership solves.

Multiplier: Public-Private Collaboration,"
https://doi.org/10.1080/0163660X.2012.665336//ZW\]

[The Case for Collaboration]{.underline}: Effectiveness and Efficiency
[Public--private collaboration]{.underline} generally [falls into
several broad categories of activities]{.underline}: [1) sharing
expertise]{.underline}; [2) exchanging information]{.underline}; and [3)
executing projects and operations]{.underline}. Both parties benefit in
tangible and intangible ways. [For the government, the key advantage is
access to expertise, analysis, skills, perspective, and resources not
always available in the public sector]{.underline}. In the current
fiscally-constrained environment, [the benefits of such collaboration to
the government are obvious]{.underline}.
[Efficiency]{.underline}---saving money and other
resources---[accrues]{.underline}, and [with the added private sector
skills, insights, and resulting innovation, so does
effectiveness]{.underline}. Like their business counterparts, these
public-sector practitioners manage people, finances, organizational
change, and "back office" operations every day. Sharing best
practices---or in some cases, the worst ones---can be educational for
those who manage our national security entities. [The private
sector]{.underline} also [offers an agility not often found in
government]{.underline}. One NGO representative working to help veterans
explains, "If NGO programs prove less effective or \[the\] needs shift,
NGO programs are easier to end than a government
program."[7]{.underline} As President Ronald Reagan quipped, "A
government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we\'ll ever see
on this Earth."[8]{.underline} Businesses can often "fail" faster than
their public counterparts, adopting lessons learned and forging ahead.
[It used to be that the government drove innovation across all sectors;
that is no longer true]{.underline}. It used to be that the government
drove innovation across all sectors in its defense and science
laboratories, reducing the incentive for collaboration. That is no
longer true. [Much of the cutting edge work is now being done in the
private sector]{.underline}. [This is most obvious today in the field
of]{.underline} computer and information [technology]{.underline}, but
extends to energy and nanotechnology, among other areas. As a result,
**[the government relies on private sector expertise to maintain its
lead in defense, space, and other endeavors related to national
security]{.underline}**. This dependency means that [the government is
also affected by private sector vulnerabilities]{.underline}---probably
even beyond areas where the private sector has the technological lead.
[Through collaboration]{.underline} regarding, for example, shared
threats on financial fraud and economic espionage, [both government and
industry can keep abreast of developing challenges]{.underline}. The
QDDR speaks for the State Department, USAID, and beyond when it asserts,
"Private sector partners can add value to our missions through their
resources, their capacity to establish presence in places we cannot,
through the technologies, networks and contacts they can tap, and
through their specialized expertise or knowledge."[9]{.underline} [For
corporate]{.underline} or non-profit [entities]{.underline},
[collaboration with the government may offer access to information and
sometimes intelligence, as well as legitimacy]{.underline}. [The private
sector often lacks the necessary information]{.underline} and/or ability
to coordinate entities that often value their privacy and autonomy over
concerted effective action. This is why [protection of critical
infrastructure]{.underline}---both brick-and-mortar and virtual---[is a
public--private effort]{.underline}. [The government can serve as the
honest broker]{.underline} to which corporations may safely disclose
vulnerabilities or proprietary information, which the government can use
to devise appropriate means to protect all corporations and society.
Other issues, such as caring for wounded veterans, are best addressed
through a comprehensive approach---which entails responsibilities for
the government to provide health care and other support as well as for
private organizations and individuals to provide employment and social
support. And operating overseas, the government often has long-term
international networks via its embassies, which even older corporations
cannot replicate. Finally, of course, governments can offer access to
funding. [In order to tap into the best minds and technology, the
government must pay for it]{.underline}, or appeal to American
philanthropy and patriotism. The appeal and response bring another
benefit to government and society: promoting social service and
responsibility. Organizations that team up with the
government---especially when there is no direct business or personal
gain involved---can foster patriotism, civic participation, and even
raise public support for government and good governance. [Individuals
who engage with government in this manner gain a sense of
accomplishment,]{.underline} lending their knowledge to our
foreign-policy and national-security goals. [Businesses can also bolster
their public image]{.underline} through collaboration billed as "pro
bono," or "corporate social responsibility." Neville Isdell, the former
Chairman and CEO of The Coca Cola Company, advocates "connected
capitalism," a system whereby businesses connect with governments,
non-profits, and civic society to shape their core business strategies
in ways that foster sustainable and profitable commercial growth *and*
contribute to addressing social problems. He works to recruit
corporations that pledge to partner with governments, communities, and
NGOs to simultaneously further corporate interests and improve society.
His motivation, in part, is a desire to help capitalism---which he
perceives as currently under attack worldwide---evolve in order to
survive.[10]{.underline} Executives from General Electric, Sun Trust
Bank, and United Parcel Service have signed up to Isdell\'s effort and
their partners include CARE and USAID. Non-profit research institutes,
universities, advocacy organizations, and humanitarian organizations can
also benefit from an association with the government by burnishing their
credentials as purveyors of knowledge and expertise, or as agile,
relevant actors. To the extent that the public views the government or
its representatives, such as military officers, favorably and trusts it
to seek qualified collaborators who have skill and integrity, private
entities and individuals can elevate their public image. Despite this,
[sometimes private entities and individuals prefer to work in
collaboration with the government as separate entities]{.underline}, as
opposed to joining the government as employees or contractors. This is
true for Blue Star Families (BSF), a non-profit supporting and
advocating for military families. "Public--private partnerships are key
to BSF\'s philosophy. Military families serve and sacrifice because we
parents, spouses, and children love our service member, and love our
country, not because we love the Pentagon. In fact, many families prefer
not to interact with 'official channels.' [So it is right and fitting
that the responsibility for helping families falls not only to the
Pentagon or the individual services, but to the larger society as
well]{.underline}."[11]{.underline}

[NATO should]{.underline} further [develop public-private partnerships

develop partnerships with local civil society [organizations that can
combat disinformation, play the role of the "watch dog" in holding
political elites to standards of transparency, and advocate for
democratic ideals and principles at the grassroots level]{.underline}.
It should also [devote additional resources to public diplomacy
campaigns]{.underline}, such as the #WeAreNATO campaign, [and engage all
member states in their coordination]{.underline}. New campaigns could
target citizens in rural areas who do not use Facebook or Twitter by
engaging them at schools, libraries, and community and retirement

#### PPP is the answer to cyber governance.

is on the significance of cyber security for contemporary security

[Owing to the complex]{.underline}, dynamic and dispersed [nature of
information and communication technology]{.underline} (ICT),
[cyber-security risks are not easily managed]{.underline}. ICT is
everywhere. It not only transcends national jurisdictions but has found
its way into nearly all spheres of modern life. [Critical
infrastructure]{.underline}, [private businesses and the most intimate
aspects of our daily lives are all affected by ICT]{.underline}, not
least through the expanding internet of things.[5]{.underline} [This
development drastically increases the potential vectors of
vulnerability]{.underline} and expands their scope to a plethora of
different actors---from states to private companies and individual
users. Moreover, [the networked nature of ICT means that cyber-security
risks are not limited to a particular physical location]{.underline}.
Cyber attacks may potentially come from anywhere. In short, cyber
security is characterized by a fundamental uncertainty. [This
uncertainty and the diversity of actors affected pose a great challenge
to the governance of cyber-security risks and call for new modes of
organizing security practices]{.underline}. **[In this regard
public--private partnerships (PPPs) are often seen as 'the answer' to
many of the challenges related to cyber-security
governance]{.underline}**: [PPPs]{.underline} are, in policy as well as
academic circles, [often considered a mode of organization that can
enhance flexibility and robustness]{.underline} by including a broader
range of civil and private actors. [In partnership meetings private
businesses are called upon to voluntarily share knowledge on national
security and to assume responsibility for ensuring an effective
management of cyber threats]{.underline}.[6]{.underline} Despite a
strong agreement about the characterization of cyber-security risk as a
'shared risk', the turn to partnerships does not itself establish what
kind of knowledge the different partners should share with each other.
Rather, the fundamental uncertainty associated with cyber security seems
to have opened up the space for contestation over 'what to counter', and
thus what counts as cyber-security knowledge.

Marian L. **Lawson** 10-28-**13** \[Specialist in Foreign Assistance
Policy, Congressional Research Service, "Foreign Assistance:
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs),"
https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R41880.pdf//ZW\]

Potential Benefits of Public-Private Partnerships [PPPs have become more
common because both public and private partners believe PPPs achieve
shared goals more effectively than each partner could by acting
alone]{.underline}. Commonly cited advantages of PPPs include the
following: • Shared Risks and Resources. While development officials are
quick to point out that PPPs are not primarily a means of saving
taxpayer dollars, [sharing the cost and financial risks of development
activities is a key attraction of modern partnerships that involve joint
resource contributions]{.underline}. [Both the government and private
entities are]{.underline} sometimes [willing to participate as partners
in a project they would not be able or willing to support in its
entirety]{.underline}. Partnership may also allow for project
implementation on a larger scale, and for cost savings based on scale,
resulting in each partner achieving a greater development return on its
investment (or a diluted cost of failure). • Sustainability. A common
criticism of traditional development activities is that they never
become self-sustaining and fade away when government funding ends.
[PPPs]{.underline} attempt to avoid this problem by
[tap]{.underline}ping i[nto core business interests and making
sustainability profitable]{.underline}. In the SUCCESS Alliance, for
example, small Vietnamese cocoa farmers were integrated into Mars's
global supply chain, having elevated their cocoa production and
processing to international standards with assistance from USAID, Mars,
and the World Cocoa Foundation. In theory, market demand should sustain
the partnership and the improved farmer incomes. While the
sustainability argument seems logical and is supported by anecdotal
evidence, there has been no comprehensive study of how PPP
sustainability compares to that of non-PPP approaches. • Market
Access/Networks. [Corporations and private entities often have networks
of customers, suppliers, supporters, and employees that can broaden the
reach of a development program beyond where a development agency could
go]{.underline}. By partnering with MTV in several regional alliances,
for example, USAID tapped into a vast global audience of young people
for its messages against human trafficking and promoting HIV/AIDS
prevention in the EXIT alliance. MTV, for its part, saw an opportunity
for positive public relations and an association with USAID that could
potentially enhance its reputation in developing countries. • Technology
and Intellectual Property. [Effective use of technology]{.underline},
which many experts believe is crucial to economic development, [can be a
daunting challenge in developing countries]{.underline}. [Through
partnering with]{.underline} Cisco, Microsoft, and other [global
technology companies]{.underline}, development [agencies are able to
overcome technical, legal, and financial barriers to accessing certain
technology]{.underline}. [The technology companies]{.underline}, in
turn, [are developing relationships and support infrastructure to
position themselves to compete for the next generation of technology
consumers]{.underline}, many of whom will live in developing countries.
• Cutting-Edge Business Practices. While USAID and other federal aid
agencies can provide technical expertise in a wide range of development
sectors, they often do not have the specialized industry knowledge that
a private company has. In Guatemala's Inclusive Market Alliance for
Rural Entrepreneurs (IMARE), for example, Walmart supplies crucial
market information that augments the impact of technical assistance and
access to credit provided through NGO partners by enabling better farm
planning and quality control of targeted crops. More than 600 rural
small-scale farmers earned higher incomes by selling to the region's
largest retailer, while Walmart strengthened its supply chain.39 In
partnering with Sesame Street, USAID gained access to advanced pedagogy
and production capacity, while Sesame Street was able to extend its
global reach into more developing countries. Reputation Enhancement.
[Positive public relations are often a significant consideration for
corporate entities entering into PPPs]{.underline}. [Partnering with a
U.S. government entity can lend legitimacy to a private
entity]{.underline}, and association with development activities can
[enhance a corporation's reputation for being socially
responsible]{.underline}. The Small Export Vegetable Alliance in Zambia,
for example, was inspired in part by private sector partner Agroflora's
desire to project a more populist image. The company was concerned that
land seizures in neighboring Zimbabwe could spread to Zambia and affect
its business if it was not seen as benefitting smallholder Zambian
farmers.40 Participating organizations and corporations may also
anticipate that partnerships will improve their relationships with
national and community leaders.

### Solvency\-\--Space

#### P3s solve space\-\-- incentivize innovation and datasharing.

Innovation in the Space Sector,"

[The space economy]{.underline}, once the sole domain of wealthy
countries, [has rapidly transitioned to a complex ecosystem of public
and private entities]{.underline}. Along the way,
[government]{.underline} and commercial sectors have [learned by doing,
recognizing and incorporating key successes and lessons learned from
past partnerships]{.underline}. Stakeholders must sort through a myriad
of complexities, conflicts, and contingencies to shape an acceptable
agreement. Most stakeholders recognize that this process is more art
than science. Yet [there is potential to achieve greater efficiency
without sacrificing transparency and accountability by utilizing a
decision framework supported by a broad understanding of past
experiences in multiple sectors]{.underline}. [As the space sector
engages in more P3s, more lessons will emerge as partners strategize,
plan, and implement]{.underline}. In the meantime, the following
lessons, from the case studies discussed above, should continue to
resonate with future P3 arrangements: • [The government partner must
conduct a comprehensive review of a commercial partner's business
plan]{.underline} including market projections, market risk, and related
cost projections. These factors may impact the ability to reliably
deliver on time and within budget. Avoid business models that are overly
optimistic or uncertain. • [Create a shared vision among
stakeholder]{.underline}s. • [Establish contingencies]{.underline} for
changing requirements. Strategically [leverage seed money for private
sector development]{.underline} and encourage healthy competition by
selecting multiple partners. • [Use the partnership to incentivize
industry]{.underline} to meet the more stringent demands of the
government partner. • [Scale contracts to the mission's
longevity]{.underline} and extended success. Be wary of commitments that
are longer than technology refresh or capital reinvestment cycles. •
[Use success to fuel incremental growth]{.underline} and to build longer
term trusted partnerships with commercial sector partners. • Carefully
structure technical and financial milestones and measure success
criteria for meeting milestones, including adjusting payment schedules
to reflect any slippage. • [Optimize value through shared data
agreements between the public and private partners]{.underline} --
focusing on a range of intended applications and niche markets. [P3s
will continue to test traditional approaches to space acquisition and
operations]{.underline}. [They can demonstrate significant advantages
such as]{.underline} improving delivery schedules, quality of service,
and [innovation]{.underline}. Capitalintensive [P3s will continue to
experience successes]{.underline} and failures [as both the public and
private sector become more adept at crafting optimal
arrangements]{.underline}. [The future also holds great promise for
public-private datasharing models]{.underline} as this type of
arrangement [will begin to spur innovation]{.underline} and extract the
most utility from space-derived data products.

https://www.justsecurity.org/82139/nato-must-tackle-digital-authoritarianism///ZW\]

NATO leaders are gathered in Madrid this week to mark the reinvigoration
of the transatlantic alliance and to discuss its ongoing challenges.
[After the fall of the Soviet Union, some dismissed NATO as a
relic]{.underline}. Vladimir Putin's brutal and unjustified war against
Ukraine to expand Russia's sphere of influence and reclaim its former
glory stands as a stark reminder that hegemonic fantasies backed by
brute force remain a threat to the international order, even in the 21st
century. [In response to Putin's aggression, NATO has recovered its
sense of purpose and relevance]{.underline}. It is also learning some
important lessons regarding the future nature of warfare, from the
criticality of adaptive leadership and robust logistics to the
importance of asymmetric approaches. One of the most crucial lessons is
that information dominance is essential, especially when confronting
authoritarian powers like a revanchist Russia or a rising China who are
willing to manufacture "facts" and create false narratives in order to
undermine the political will and unity of their adversaries. [As we look
to the future, NATO must ask itself: How can we strengthen
post-Westphalian institutions]{.underline} for a Wiki-world? In the last
century, the United States and our allies sacrificed lives and treasure
to defend the liberal world order, vanquishing the Axis Powers in World
War II and Soviet Communism in the Cold War. [In this century,
traditional reliance on kinetic force is not enough]{.underline}. The
ability to control, process, disseminate and protect information is
critical. Malign actors are investing in a host of digital technologies
without any restraint or regulation, preparing for the day when
artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a dominant force on the
battlefield. [Digital authoritarianism]{.underline} -- [using technology
for disinformation, ubiquitous surveillance and oppression of
populations at home, and coercion abroad]{.underline} -- [is not the way
of democracies]{.underline}, nor can it ever become our way. Instead,
[we need to reinvent our alliances and our own frameworks for
information dominance consistent with our values]{.underline}. [A
coalition]{.underline} of like-minded nations [could shape international
technical and ethical standards]{.underline}, promote alignment
[on]{.underline} technology export controls, increase [AI]{.underline}
talent exchanges and technology investment, and importantly, facilitate
cross-border data sharing. [Creating an Artificial Intelligence Network
in collaboration with our allies shouldn't be just a hortatory
statement]{.underline} or a commitment to compete on this turf with
actors who don't share our values. Instead, [establishing information
dominance]{.underline} through establishing such a network [should be a
strategic imperative]{.underline}. We have strengths, as do our allies,
that authoritarian powers can only dream of, starting with free and open
institutions that generate creativity and innovation across all
intellectual and military disciplines. [We can fully engage allied
research universities and private sector companies to accelerate the
development and integration of ethical AI]{.underline} that will give us
an edge in everything from predictive warning of crises to better,
faster human decision-making. For years, we've been fixated on whether
countries are meeting their commitments under NATO to spend 2% of their
GDP on defense. While more and more allies are meeting this goal,
particularly in the wake of Putin's aggression in the heart of Europe,
the more provocative and consequential question for the long term is:
Are we, together, investing in the development of the right new
technologies and concepts? And are we adopting them with adequate speed
and scale to be able to deter and, if necessary, defeat future
aggression? The United States invested \$4 billion in government-led,
unclassified AI-related R&D in 2019 alone and remains the leading
destination for global AI investments. Counting the private sector,
America's annual investment in AI is over \$40 billion, with more than
2,000 American AI firms, including startups and large private companies.
But [making AI a strategic priority for NATO would be an enormous force
multiplier]{.underline}. To date, [Europe has lagged behind in
AI]{.underline}. The MIT Sloan Management Review surveyed cross-industry
AI practices and found 97% of Chinese companies have a strategy for AI,
compared with just 62% of their European counterparts. [Putting AI at
the heart of the NATO Alliance could be a catalyst]{.underline} to
addressing Europe's growing AI gap. It could also create valuable
synergies with U.S. efforts. After all, this is the playbook that won
the Cold War: [creating public-private synergy]{.underline} and bringing
a network of trusted allies [with]{.underline} shared values and
tremendous talent and [intellectual capacity into direct partnership
with the innovation and creativity of America's entrepreneurial
centers]{.underline} and our capital markets. Alliances are about more
than talking points or traditions--their value comes from what they can
do now to shape a better future for us all. In the case of NATO, that
means shaping a dynamic security environment in a period of intensifying
great power competition and profound technological disruption. [If NATO
wants to stay relevant and be prepared for a very different future, it
is time to modernize the alliance]{.underline} by working with allies
today to triumph with tomorrow's technology. That's a conversation that
should be front and center in Madrid.

**9. Expand Enforcement Cooperation with Allies** [Cybersecurity is
becoming a key part of the foreign policy agenda]{.underline}. [To
continue progress]{.underline}, participants believed that [the United
States]{.underline}, its allies, and partners [should pursue the
implementation of international norms for cyberspace]{.underline} to
enhance accountability and responsible action. [Supporting and promoting
norms of responsible behavior and international law should be a
priority]{.underline}, as well as raising the profile and stressing the
urgency in diplomatic spheres. [Collaboration between national CERTs
during an incident was found to be valuable by many of the participants
from global companies]{.underline}, who drew on resources in more than
their home country. A [global company will have relationships with
several national CERTs]{.underline}. [Support and communication from
more experienced CERTs can make a big difference]{.underline} for
smaller company teams, who may be dealing with an overwhelming workload.
[Another area participants believed would be useful to expanding
collaboration is the arrest of bad actors]{.underline}. Some
participants called attention to the FBI legal attachés in other
countries. In a related vein, in October 2021, the United States
convened the Counter Ransomware Initiative, which included
representatives from 30 countries and the European Union to discuss the
security threat posed by ransomware. One of the discussion points was,
precisely, how to reinforce "timely and consistent collaboration across
law enforcement, national security authorities, cybersecurity agencies,
and financial intelligence units," recognizing the transnational nature
of the threat to improving enforcement.

needs to address,"

[Emerging technologies are the]{.underline} geo-economics [Achilles heel
NATO needs to address to deter aggressors]{.underline}, write General
John Allen, Heiko Borchert and Marcin Zaborowski. [To ensure NATO's
relevance]{.underline} and to keep "our people safe", [the Alliance
"must continue to strengthen and modernize]{.underline} our [deterrence
and defence]{.underline}," NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said
at the Riga Summit on 30 November 2021. [Innovation plays a critical
role in modernizing armed forces]{.underline} amid a complex strategic
environment. [To this purpose, Stoltenberg unveiled]{.underline} the
Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic
([DIANA]{.underline}) on 22 October 2021. DIANA [shall bring defence and
commercial companies together with military users to develop novel
solutions]{.underline} that meet the needs of the future battlefield.
[He also launched the NATO Innovation Fund]{.underline} to invest up to
€1bn to support innovators developing emerging technologies. The
announcement comes at a time when the Alliance is working on a new
Strategic Concept. [Innovation will be key to preserving NATO's
edge]{.underline}, as the Secretary-General pointed out in his 2030 food
for thought paper. [Although NATO is a potent defence organization,
emphasis on emerging technologies reveals its Achilles'
heel]{.underline}. [Artificial intelligence, autonomy, biotechnology,
quantum technology, and other technologies are at the heart of
geo-economic competition]{.underline}. Geoeconomic competition unfolds
around the projection of economic power within and across the domains of
land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace to achieve political goals.
[Today's geoeconomic dynamic defines winning business models amid a
growing dichotomy between market-driven and state-driven
nations]{.underline}. It aims to set the rules, principles, and
standards that guide economic activities and access to and ownership of
emerging technologies. [NATO's current emphasis on emerging
technologies]{.underline} with defence and commercial applications
[risks making the Alliance subject to this new geoeconomic
dynamic]{.underline}. [This dynamic can undermine NATO's innovation
agenda and endanger its strategic edge]{.underline}. Therefore, [NATO
needs to respond]{.underline}. First, [NATO needs to embrace the
realities of economic security seriously]{.underline}. This call flows
logically from Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, encouraging
allies' economic collaborations. In our view, economic security combines
national security and economic policy with technology and innovation
policy to identify economic disruptions. It also prevents these
disruptions from arising and strengthens a coping capacity to deal with
economic emergencies. Economic security requires allies, for example, to
engage on defence-critical standards, advancing transparency for defence
supply chains, and considering the interplay between technology
development, foreign direct investment, and export control. Therefore,
the new Strategic Concept should incorporate economic security as an
essential element. Second, [economic security requires NATO to shape
mindsets about defence investments]{.underline} and sustainability.
Already today, defence companies face financial challenges as banks
cancel bank accounts or refrain from covering export risks. The emphasis
on environmental, social, and governance criteria (ESG) that
increasingly shapes and determines financial investments will reinforce
these problems as defence is considered toxic. But a narrow
interpretation of ESG that considers defence incompatible with the world
view underpinning ESG is detrimental to NATO's ambition to invest in
companies. It also means other investors will likely shy away from
investing in the same companies. Therefore, [the Alliance needs to step
up activities with the European Commission,]{.underline} which works on
a classification system to identify ESG-compliant activities, to make
defence investments compatible. Third, business is the first line of
defence in a geoeconomic world, and [NATO needs a platform to discuss
geoeconomics with business]{.underline}. Today, the NATO Industry Forum
is the leading gathering to address defence industrial matters with
defence companies. However[, the emphasis on emerging technologies
underlines the importance of non-defence companies]{.underline}.
Therefore, NATO should envisage a new special format of the North
Atlantic Council to meet with the NATO Industry Forum members -- and
possibly also the European Commission -- to allow state and corporate
leaders to jointly engage on the proposed economic security agenda.
Fourth, [strategic-level public-private dialogue also breathes new life
into deepening cooperation]{.underline} [with the private
sector]{.underline}. NATO should become an early adopter of the
solutions developed with allied money. Making NATO the launch customer
sends important market signals and provides companies with an initial
track record confirming the relevance of their solutions. In addition,
[the Alliance should step up efforts to incorporate business into
military operations]{.underline}. [Logistics companies already play a
crucial role]{.underline}, and traditional defence businesses provide
frontline support. [The next stage comes with closely integrating
digital companies to leverage their contribution]{.underline}. But for
non-defence companies to provide frontline support, NATO not only needs
the right mindset, but the Alliance also needs to think about incentives
such as covering personnel risks on overseas deployments. Finally,
[NATO's ability to stimulate innovation]{.underline} and ensure economic
security also [depends on how it does business]{.underline}. Critically,
NATO needs to strive for a mission and capabilities-based innovation
portfolio that maximises the value of allied money. NATO may take a page
from the financial services industry and use a real options approach to
manage technological risk and drive technology development. This
approach prices technology building blocks like financial options,
advances risk mitigation, speeds up technology adoption and gives force
planners and developers more leeway to maximise input and output. In
addition, NATO should offer strategic hedging solutions for defence
critical raw materials by combining corporate demand estimates with
AI-based insights on financial and raw material markets. This will
facilitate optimal, company-tailored hedging strategies to mitigate the
corporate security of supply and price risks. Overall, [NATO's relevance
in the 21st century remains tackling defence challenges]{.underline} in
a new strategic environment, increasingly defined by emerging and
rapidly changing technologies and the profoundly important role of the
private sector. To this purpose, NATO has embraced innovation and
emerging technologies. This step, however, makes NATO subject to a new
geoeconomic dynamic that unfolds around competition for standards,
business models, technologies, and supply chains. This [requires NATO to
make economic security a core element of its new Strategic Concept to
ensure NATO's edge]{.underline}. In turn, this will provide a sound
basis for expanded cooperation with the European Union, and make NATO an
esteemed partner of the new Transatlantic Trade and Technology Council,
the new body set up to enhance the EU-U.S. technology, economic, and
trade partnership.

pace with digital transformation on both sides of the Atlantic. This
forum, focused on digital transformation at large in the defence sector,
[can help identify problems which need collaborative approaches across

first from multiple angles will create a vision all stakeholders stand
behind. [Establishing this dialogue to foster this shared understanding

disruption]{.underline}. [NATO]{.underline} has excellent [resources

boundaries]{.underline}; thus, **[involving non-traditional actors is
crucial]{.underline}**. [Rethinking military doctrine and civil-military

understanding on what disruptive technology means for different member
states on both sides of the Atlantic will set the scene for bridging the
widening innovation gap. Anderson and Townsend argue that disruptive
technologies have different meanings in the United States and Europe. 22
Add to that the innovation gap both across the Atlantic and within
Europe between various member states, understanding how digital
transformation impacts the different security landscapes and interests
are paramount for closing this gap. A final aspect to consider is to
include all institutional stakeholders from legal, finance, military
officers -- both users and commanders, the full spectrum of the industry
from prime contractors to start-ups, and other non-traditional
stakeholders. In particular seen from the recent implementation of
Europe's GDPR regulation which impacts transatlantic digital
cooperation. 23 A frank and open dialogue on moving forward in ensuring
Europe's innovation culture does not fall behind in the bigger world
scene is warranted. [By establishing this dialogue, institutional
blindness across the Alliance will diminish, and more focus on finding
opportunities within existing bureaucracies will prevail]{.underline}.

which terrorists threaten to explode in a crowded port city;
cyber-attacks that shut down banking services in a European Union
country ahead of sensitive elections; and the mysterious severing of
undersea cables linking the country to the rest of the EU. Among the
ideas, [participants emphasized the need for better intelligence
sharing]{.underline} to ensure relevant policy makers are fully informed
of hybrid risks; the importance of [greater international cooperation
between law-enforcement and civil protection]{.underline} services to
match that among the military; for pro-active media strategies to keep
citizens informed and counter fake news during a crisis; [and outreach
to all sectors of society to counter hostile efforts to

Department of Defense, "Cybercom Commander: Public-Private Partnership
Needed for Cybersecurity,"
https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/1006807/cybercom-commander-public-private-partnerships-needed-for-cybersecurity///ZW\]

[The public-private cybersecurity partnership between private companies
and U.S. Cyber Command and other federal agencies has been
uneven]{.underline} so far despite some fledgling success, [but
collaboration is critical given growing threats to everyone from
cyberspace]{.underline}, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command said here
yesterday. Navy Adm. Mike S. Rogers, who is also director of the
National Security Agency, spoke during the Wall Street Journal's CEO
Council annual meeting on the fight for global security in an era of
borderless wars. On the government's ability to help industry during
major cyberattacks, Rogers said [it's unrealistic to expect the private
sector alone to withstand the onslaught of activity]{.underline} that is
being [directed against them by nation-states]{.underline} and other
actors. "Likewise," the admiral added, "[I don\'t think it\'s realistic
to say the government\'s just going to do this \[by
itself]{.underline}\] because the challenge with the government doing it
is, if you want me to defend something I can\'t ... defend a network if
I \... don\'t have access to that network structure," a level of outside
access the private sector has resisted. **Critical Success** An
exception to this was Sony Corporation after a [2014 Sony Pictures
Entertainment hack]{.underline} of confidential data sponsored by North
Korea. Rogers said that [a positive aspect of the hack was great
collaboration among a private company]{.underline}, the private-sector
computer network expertise that Sony brought in [and federal
agencies]{.underline}. "They knew they were dealing with something
\[after the hack\] so they went out and hired expertise and capability
from within the private sector," the admiral said. "They then came to
the conclusion that this was something bigger than they had initially
thought so they reached out to the government. I give them big kudos for
that." Sony officials were "very up front" when they approached the
government, he added, saying they asked for help to understand what
happened and to make sure it didn't happen again. **Providing Value**
"We said, if you want us to provide value and insight we need full
access to your network and your data," Rogers recalled, adding, "They
had no issue at all, just insure that you inform us of what you\'re
doing, why you\'re doing it and exactly what you\'re doing and you stick
to that." It "[worked out great]{.underline}," Rogers said, and [there
was good information flow]{.underline} between Sony and the U.S.
government response team, which consisted mainly of Cybercom, NSA, the
FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. "One of the reasons why the
partnership is so important \-- using NSA resources to monitor and guard
U.S. networks \-- that\'s not our mission," Rogers said in March 2015 in
testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on cyber operations,
"and it\'s against the law ... but on the other hand, I do want to
create a partnership where we\'re able to share information with each
other." The FBI was designated as the lead agency, Rogers said, "and the
FBI turns to NSA and says, 'We could use your analytic help, will you
partner with us in working with Sony?'" The admiral said Sony cooperated
completely with the government during the investigation. **Significant
Calamity** Rogers said that as director of NSA and commander of
Cybercom, the agreement he always reaches with whoever they're working
with is that neither agency will use the data they gain for anything
other than the exact purpose they've discussed. "I don\'t want it to get
to the point where it takes some significant calamity to drive us to the
conclusion that we\'ve got to do something different than what we\'re
doing now," the admiral added. During Rogers' remarks, the audience of
chief executive officers participated an instant poll was taken on the
question: Do you trust the government enough with your information to
work with it during a cyberattack? The choices were: a) absolutely, b)
only if my company is attacked, or c) never. The result was that 56
percent said they "absolutely" trusted the government enough to work
with them, 34 percent said only if their company was attacked, and 9
percent said "never." For Rogers, this was a positive result. "Overall
that\'s pretty good," he said. "Less than 10 percent of you said that
there were no circumstances under which \[you\] would consider doing
this. From my perspective that\'s a broad positive \-- that means
there\'s a willingness among 91 percent of you to have some form of
dialog and to potentially look at \[partnering with the government on
cybersecurity\] as a possibility."

[Technology advances]{.underline}. The participants agreed that
[technology advances are important for NATO's continued
cohesion]{.underline}. Technology will constitute a significant
intervening factor in how NATO nations maintain their cohesion in the
future for three reasons. First, [ever-evolving communication technology
can facilitate the spread of risks]{.underline} coming [from outside of
the Alliance]{.underline} and exacerbate their negative effect. The
[examples]{.underline} that resonated the most during focus group
sessions [are information warfare]{.underline} and targeted propaganda
[against NATO nations]{.underline}. Internet communications technology
creates infinite room for alternative media that distort reality,
contribute to the emergence of populist and radical movements, and
increase the danger of miscommunication among nations. Second, [NATO
risks losing the innovation game to the commercial defense industrial
sector]{.underline}. In the future, [private companies will continue to
stay ahead of NATO in designing specifications and setting standards for
platforms]{.underline}. [This can have a major impact on readiness and
interoperability among NATO nations if their innovation

[The cyber and space domains have often been interpreted as public
commons]{.underline}. [As a result]{.underline}, these [commons are
difficult to govern and serve as the intersection of public and private
actors]{.underline}. [NATO must seek to lead cooperation]{.underline}
within the Alliance, across partnership states, and [with private actors
to maintain a scientific edge]{.underline} (Rugolo and Monic 2022).
[NATO currently supports the Industry Cyber Partnership]{.underline} to
improve Allies' network security and increase resilience. [This industry
partnership must be replicated in a NATO Industry Emerging Technology
Partnership]{.underline}, to [facilitate a competitive edge in
capabilities]{.underline} that are on the horizon or not fully realized
in the operational security environment. [The agreement to
establish]{.underline} Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North
Atlantic ([DIANA]{.underline}) [for civil-military
cooperation]{.underline} at the 2021 Brussels Summit[, is a **step in
the right direction**]{.underline}. Once established, [cooperation must
also be facilitated across partnership hubs within NATO to **prevent
stove piping of innovation**]{.underline}. Additionally, [it is critical
that these innovation centers encourage partnerships across the entire
spectrum of private industry]{.underline}, from startups and garage
innovators to large scale private corporations with extensive scale
research and development (Kosal 2022). Finally, intra-Alliance
cooperation requires intelligence sharing and capability development
among member states to ensure that the Alliance continues to meet the
challenges of the strategic environment. One example of intra-Alliance
cooperation that compliments NATO's efforts is the European Union's
initiatives to bolster cybersecurity. The European Union Agency for
Cybersecurity's efforts to improve capacity, cooperation, and a
whole-of-society approach to cybersecurity ultimately bolster NATO's
deterrence by denial by hardening the attack surface of Europe.

[A new initiative announced by NATO at its summit this week in Madrid
has important implications for business leaders who are concerned about
cyberattacks]{.underline}. The multinational organization said it will
launch a rapid response force that will ramp up collaborations with
military and civilian organizations to help meet cyber threats. As
important as it is to protect against and respond to cyber threats, the
plan comes with built-in challenges and limitations. Strengthening Cyber
Defenses "We are confronted by cyber, space, hybrid and other asymmetric
threats, and by the malicious use of emerging and disruptive
technologies," NATO said in a statement. "We face systemic competition
from those, including the People's Republic of China, who challenge our
interests, security, and values and seek to undermine the rules-based
international order." "We will significantly strengthen our cyber
defenses through enhanced civil-military cooperation," [the declaration
says]{.underline}. "[We will also expand partnership with industry.
Allies have decided, on a voluntary basis and using national assets, to
build and exercise a virtual rapid response cyber capability to respond
to significant malicious cyber activities]{.underline}."
[Challenges]{.underline} "[Most of those in the cyber world are excited
about this possibility]{.underline} but some challenges face it. First,
[it is all voluntary so countries and industries will have to want to
actually do it]{.underline}. Second, each country may do something
different so it could be patchwork in its establishment," crisis
management expert Baruch Labunski, CEO of Rank Secure said in an email
interview. "Finally, [the joint effort of civilian industry and the
military can be]{.underline} commendable or [dangerous]{.underline}. [It
depends on your point of view and how one looks at government
overreach]{.underline}," he observed. Taking Responsibility NATO's new
program does not take the pressure off companies and organizations to
protect themselves from cyberattacks. "Cybersecurity teams must take
responsibility as information warfare continues to become part of the
rapidly evolving threat landscape," Wasim Khaled, co-founder and CEO of
Blackbird.AI said in an email. "These new risks are driven by a new
breed of threat actors who exploit digital media to drive harmful
narratives that can \[impact\] organizations, employees, and executives
using sophisticated tradecraft and technologies.\" Hybrid Warfare \"In
today\'s threat landscape, military adversaries and threat actors are
combining cyber, information and kinetic attacks as a form of hybrid
warfare that is highly effective when coordinated," Khaled said. "The
new NATO cyber rapid reaction force will help countries against
cyberattacks that are designed to intimidate and disrupt an entire
nation," he observed. 'No Surprise' At least one cybersecurity expert
was not surprised by NATO's announcement. "For those that work in the
field of cybersecurity, NATO's new strategy comes as no surprise. As we
suspected and have now confirmed through the conflict in Ukraine,
cyberspace is a critical dimension of operations in modern warfare,"
Robert Stines, a partner in the Litigation Practice Group at Freeborn &
Peters and a cybersecurity advisor said in a statement. "We have also
learned from past events that cyber threats tend to detrimentally impact
the private sector," he noted. To Be Determined "[While we know very
little about the scope of NATO's new strategy, the pledge to work with
the private sector to counter threats is very encouraging]{.underline}.
Of course, [the question becomes how does the private sector benefit
from NATO's new commitment]{.underline}," Stines said. "[It will also be
interesting to see how NATO plans ...to bring together governments, the
private sector, and academia to bolster NATO's technological
edge]{.underline}. [I suspect that America's technology
giants]{.underline} (Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft) [will have a role in the
Accelerator]{.underline}," he concluded. 3 Key Cyber Trends Preventing
and responding to cyberattacks continues to be a top priority and
business leaders should be aware of three key related trends, according
to Khaled. He said the trends include: Convergence "Convergence between
information operations and traditional cyberattacks will continue to
increase. Modern cybersecurity companies will integrate specialized
information operations technology and fuse these capabilities with their
existing cyber threat platforms." Attacks On Supply Chains "Supply chain
attacks will be on the rise due to ongoing economic shortages and
disruptions through ransomware and other means in these critical times
which could consist of holding victim's data hostage, leaking and
publicizing breaches, and attacking vendor supply chains." Ransomware
"Modern ransomware extortion will continue to proliferate across
traditional enterprise environments. The market size for offensive
skills has grown incredibly due to the potential payout size of
cryptocurrency breaches that can exceed \$100M on a single intrusion."

The United States and China have engaged in security cooperation on a
variety of international issues since the normalization of relations in
1979. In fact, security cooperation began even before the formal
establishment of state-to-state relations. We recall that during the
height of the Cold War the two nations demonstrated that when a pressing
and shared security concern in that case, the former Soviet Union
presented itself, Washington and Beijing were capable of working
together, extant differences notwithstanding. Security consultations and
sometime security cooperation between the two countries continue today.
But as the record of security cooperation is reviewed, one comes to the
conclusion that, for the most part, U.S.-China security cooperation has
been mainly of a political nature and operationalized at a high level of
strategic policy coordination. Security cooperation between the two
nations has been largely the purview of U.S. and Chinese civilian
officials and diplomats, not generals and admirals. In other words, over
the course of 30 years of relations, security cooperation between the
defense-military establishments of the United States and China \-- the
uniformed services \-- has been the exception rather than the rule. If a
serious discussion about future security cooperation between the U.S.
Navy and the PLA Navy is to take place \-- a leitmotif of this series of
conferences as described by the sponsors \-- then some of the issues,
challenges, and problems from the past need to be confronted even as we
look over the horizon. For the purposes of this paper, [**security
cooperation** is **defined** as the two militaries working together to
achieve a common objective \-- not high-level visits, exchanges, port
calls, or other activities that are mainly symbolic or representational
in nature]{.underline}.

[Security cooperation is]{.underline} a compilation of [financial,
educational, and material resources, that]{.underline} at their
foundation [are supported by the United States]{.underline}, in
particular the **[Department of Defense]{.underline}**, and are used to
support the peaceful development of democracies in foreign countries.
The [**resources provided by the Department of Defense** are **available
to foreign countries** after the host nation]{.underline} requests the
peaceful assistance of the U.S. military in response to systemic
deficiencies in the bureaucratic management of a nation state or when a
nation state [recognizes that its military limitations prevent it from
properly defending its geographic borders]{.underline}. The host
nation's request for support from the U.S. is typically an effort by the
foreign country to develop its internal capacity to protect its people
and limit internal or external threats. The security cooperation
exercise Baltic Operation, held in Estonia, is an example of a foreign
country using the resources 9 provided by the United States to improve
its national defense capabilities in direct response to a perceived
threat to its sovereign borders. In this scenario Estonia is attempting
to develop its military capabilities and project an image of strength in
an effort to maintain the freedom it earned, from Russia, at the
conclusion of the Singing Revolution in 1992 and prevent a future
Russian incursion across its borders. [In contrast to this appropriate
use and definition of security cooperation]{.underline} as a strategy to
prevent conflict, the [Obama]{.underline} Administration [is using the
term security cooperation]{.underline} as a way [to]{.underline}
[define]{.underline} a national **[exit]{.underline}** strategy from a
two front war, a strategy that at its heart is based on the

How we deal with our adversaries is changing in response to these
developments in the security environment. How we deal with our
international allies and partners also should change. [For many years,
the term "security cooperation" referred to efforts by the]{.underline}
Department of Defense [(DOD) to promote U.S. security]{.underline}
interests through the interaction with and development of friendly and
allied security capabilities.2 [This definition is
evolving]{.underline}, however, [as illustrated by recent strategic
documents and statements by the President and Secretary of
Defense.]{.underline}3 [The term as used recently includes synchronized
efforts by the whole-of-government to build the security
capacity]{.underline} of U.S. friends and allies, [including the
development of economic and political capabilities]{.underline}. The
most recent strategic guidance calls for increased emphasis on an
interagency and interorganizational approach to building partner
capacity and capability, focused on promoting stability and preventing
conflict before it begins, all within a framework that emphasizes
governance and rule of law. Put another way, recent strategic guidance
advocates a whole-of-government approach as the means for translating
national security objectives into the outcome of increased partner
capacity. This change represents recognition that a wide variety of
skill sets is necessary to address these changes in the security
environment. Unfortunately, this change presents challenges for current
security cooperation practices.

The current structure of security cooperation, that is, the
infrastructure of government agencies that participate in security
cooperation activities, does not readily support this new guidance. The
current security cooperation organization originated in the aftermath of
World War II, and continued to evolve through the Cold War. Although the
Department of State ([DOS) has responsibility for planning and executing
security cooperation]{.underline}, the system primarily addresses the
military component of security in terms of equipment and training. The
DOD, under the auspices of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) executes these portions of U.S. Security cooperation endeavors,
which constitute the preponderance of efforts, both in terms of labor
and fund allocation. Furthermore, the DOD's share has grown considerably
in the past five years as Congress significantly increased funding
authorities in order to facilitate stabilization in Iraq and
Afghanistan.4 **[The key issue]{.underline}**, then, [is how to shift
the emphasis from the Department of Defense to efforts shared among

#### The private sector and military can work together.

Kolinda **Grabar-Kitarovíc 06-16**-2022 \[Former President of Croatia,
Defense One, "NATO Must Ensure Defense and Civilian Industries Work
Together,"
https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2022/06/nato-must-ensure-defense-and-civilian-industries-work-together/368250///ZW\]

The internet, microwaves, and synthetic rubber came into our lives as
products invented for military purposes. Even everyday things, such as
undershirts and concentrated fruit juice were created to improve the
combat readiness of armed forces. Though many people typically associate
the military with war and suffering, this industry has been a source of
incredible progress, producing inventions that made our lives longer,
healthier, and easier. These days, innovation is likely to run the other
way, with [the military benefiting from inventions developed with
private funding]{.underline}. [A symbiotic relationship between military
needs and human progress is not necessarily the default]{.underline}.
Instead, [it requires a well-oiled innovation ecosystem in which
military and civilian industries share their expertise and knowledge
with one another]{.underline}. NATO has recently announced several
initiatives to build on past success, but more are needed---particularly
as members increase their military funding. Virtually all alliance
members are investing more in defense or are soon planning to do so.
Germany, for example, declared that it would create a 100-billion-Euro
fund and reach its 2% goal in 2022. Poland, which shares the longest EU
border with Ukraine, has taken in more than 3.5 million Ukrainian
refugees and promised to dedicate 3% of its GDP to defense. Croatia
ramped up its defense investment to 2.3% of GDP. To ensure that this new
investment spurs innovation and co-operation between military and
civilian industries as well as academia, [NATO announced in April the
Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic]{.underline}.
[DIANA will concentrate on deep technologies, including artificial
intelligence, big-data processing, quantum-enabled technologies,
biotechnology, novel materials, and outer space]{.underline}. In
addition, 17 [NATO nations have agreed to set up the world's first
multi-sovereign venture capital fund]{.underline}. It will invest 1
billion Euros in early-stage startups and other deep tech funds aligned
with its strategic objectives. But NATO members need to do more to
maintain their technological advantage over Russia and China, who are
also increasing spending on military research and development. The
trends make this clear. In 1960, the U.S. accounted for 69 percent of
global R&D investments, with U.S. defense-related R&D accounting for no
less than 36% of global spending. The bulk (65%) of U.S. investments in
defense-related R&D was financed from the federal budget. However, by
2019, the U.S. share of global R&D fell to 30%, and the share of federal
government investment in defense-related R&D fell from 65% to 21%,
whereas the share of business investment in R&D has grown from 33% to
71%. This leaves no doubt that [meaningful innovation is not possible
without close co-operation with the private sector]{.underline}. As NATO
prepares to adopt its next Strategic Concept at the summit in Madrid, it
is essential that it focus on mechanisms that maintain its technological
advantage. As part of GLOBSEC's work at the Future Security and Defense
Council, we have proposed several ideas to help promote innovation in
the Alliance. [We are convinced that NATO's innovation ecosystem must
integrate public and private sectors to ensure this edge]{.underline}.

### Solvency

#### The counterplan fails\-\-- the government and private sector don't trust each other.

Evelyn **Farkas** 08-11-20**11** \[Evelyn N. Farkas, Ph.D., Senior
Advisor for Public-Private Partnership to the Supreme Allied Commander
(SACEUR) and Commander, U.S. European Command, Atlantic Council,

From Evelyn Farkas, U.S. European Command: "Why should the public and
private sectors collaborate today?" The answer? The complex challenges
that we face around the world today often require skills and approaches
beyond traditional military capabilities. Collaboration allows us to
meet these challenges utilizing specific expertise found in the private
sector. The private sector can provide agility, swift innovation, and a
unique resource set. Together, government and private entities can
reduce shared risks, minimize costs, and address mutual threats like
terrorism, organized crime, cyber attacks, and climate change. The
government gains access to the private sector's expertise and resources,
and private sector entities benefit from the information sharing
involved in collaboration and the legitimacy gained from meeting complex
challenges to provide for the greater good. . . . [NATO adopted a
comprehensive approach that recognized the need to build
partnerships]{.underline} with non-military entities both inside and
outside the government. With this in mind, [in 2008]{.underline}, [NATO
launched the Building Integrity Initiative,]{.underline} which works
with private NGOs like Transparency International, to reduce corruption
in defense establishments in Europe and Afghanistan. . . . [First, is
the issue of trust]{.underline}. [Neither sector likes to broadly share
information about vulnerabilities]{.underline}. [Corporations worry that
it could lead to the public revelation of weaknesses]{.underline} and of
sensitive intellectual property. [The government is cautious about
disclosing national security vulnerabilities to private
entities]{.underline} that have international ownership or global
interests and about safeguarding the privacy of U.S. citizens. And
[finally]{.underline}, [there is the problem of how to institutionalize
this collaboration]{.underline}. Because the responsibility for
advancing public-private collaboration is so decentralized,
[optimization and coordination of efforts across the government has
proven to be difficult]{.underline}.

### Impact Turn

#### Confronting China causes [overstretch]{.underline} and [escalation spirals]{.underline}. 

**Depetris** 8-18-20**20**, fellow at Defense Priorities and a columnist
at the Washington Examiner. (Daniel Depetris, \"China isn\'t the Soviet
Union, and the US needs to find a different way to compete\", *Business
Insider*,
https://www.businessinsider.com/us-needs-to-find-different-way-to-compete-with-china-2020-8)

Unfortunately, simplifying China as a modern-day Soviet Union
misdiagnoses the problem and leads to a faulty cure. [[Combatting
Chinese power **everywhere**]{.mark} and **anywhere** [will **exhaust
the US**, **deplete its resources** and **weaken US power**]{.mark} over
the long-term.]{.underline}

For nearly 30 years, the Washington foreign policy establishment has
gotten used to the United States being the paramount power in the global
system. But this is no longer the world we are living in.

[While the US is still the world\'s largest military and economic power,
China is a **close second**]{.underline}. Since the dawn of the century,
the Chinese economy has increased from \$1.2 trillion to \$14.3
trillion. [China\'s **exponential growth** has allowed the CCP to invest
additional resources into building up a **capable, modernized** and
**proficient military**, including a **world-class navy.**]{.underline}

With its frequent forays into Japanese waters, flyovers across the
Taiwan Straits, and trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative in Eurasia,
[China is doing what rising powers have done throughout history ---
translating its economic success into **geopolitical leverage**. A US
policy of [**containment** would have the **adverse affect** of
**heightening the**]{.mark} **sense of [alarmism]{.mark}** [in
Beijing.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The U.S. can and should compete with China economically. But it should
do so responsibly in order to prevent this competitiveness from drifting
into military affairs.

A decoupling from China, Washington\'s largest trading partner outside
of North America, is not a realistic proposal. A complete severance of
economic ties will produce unprecedented pain for middle-class Americans
and roil the international financial system.

[[A **military-to-military showdown**]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile,
[simply [**entrenches hardline positions** in]{.mark} both Washington
and [Beijing and **lessens the credibility** of]{.mark} those who call
for [**dialogue** and **deescalation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### China rise is [peaceful]{.underline} now\-\--encirclement makes it [fast]{.underline} and [hostile]{.underline}. 

**Goldstein 20**, associate professor in the Strategic Research
Department at the US Naval War College. (Lyle, 7-22-2020, \"China's
Putative Threat to U.S. National Security\", Published in *A Dangerous
World? Threat Perception and U.S. National Security*,
https://www.cato.org/publications/publications/chinas-putative-threat-us-national-security)

Factions and interests on both the right and the left are now
disturbingly united in an effort to cast China as the next
multidimensional threat to the U.S.---on par with or even exceeding that
of the Soviet Union in its dimensions. Many of those interests,
moreover, are poised to profit from such a characterization. A few
obvious facts, however, are worth repeating when considering the
putative threat posed by China to U.S. national security: [[China has
**not resorted** to **any**]{.mark} **significant [use of
force]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **more than [three decades]{.mark}**[, it
has **no foreign bases**, and]{.mark} it [remains]{.mark} rather
**[weak]{.mark}**]{.underline} (compared with U.S. forces) [[in]{.mark}
the domains of [**power projection** and **nuclear war
fighting**]{.mark}. In the coming decades, all of [those metrics may
**reverse**, and China could **morph**]{.mark}]{.underline} from a
bungling, paranoid panda [[into a
**fire‐​breathing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, goose‐​stepping
**[[dragon]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It seems likely that [Beijing will
have the]{.mark} **requisite [resources]{.mark}**, **bureaucratic
[discipline]{.mark}**[, and **talent** to make such a
transition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [it is **not short** of
strategists advocating for more aggressive steps to counter the United
States]{.underline}.41 [[Washington's]{.mark} overall [goal should be to
**forestall that metamorphosis**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in part [by
**acknowledging** China's security concerns and]{.mark} by **[seeking
compromises]{.mark}** on the many issues that divide the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China]{.underline}, as
outlined in the previous section. It is worth reiterating that [Beijing
is planning neither to **attack** the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [nor to **conquer East Asia**]{.underline}. Rather,
[its foreign policy behavior has]{.underline}, by and large, [comported
itself well with current international norms]{.underline}---in rather
stark contrast to Moscow's much more confrontational approach toward the
West.

#### US retrenchment prevents war from status competition and gives China a peaceful stake in the [current]{.underline} order 

**Ward, 17** - Assistant Professor of Government at Cornell University
(Steven, [Status and the Challenge of Rising Powers]{.underline}, p.
217-218

The former approach is one that few policymakers and scholars openly
promote.23 [If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
interested in avoiding the creation of a deeply revisionist,
anti-Western China, it needs to accommodate China's status
claims]{.underline}. Since these likely include the right to a sphere of
influence in East Asia, [accommodation would likely have to involve a
reduction of the American military presence and American
influence]{.underline} in that region. This does not mean conceding
global leadership to China. Rather, the aim would be to acknowledge that
China, as a great power, deserves the same rights that the United States
does in world politics -- including the right to manage East Asia and
the South China Sea the way that the United States manages Latin America
and the Caribbean.

This approach carries with it great risks and costs as well.What would
be the effect on navigation and trade through the South China Sea? Would
important American allies like Japan and South Korea turn into Beijing's
vassals? What if an American withdrawal from East Asia produces a
regional arms race? And what if China grows more ambitious rather than
more satisfied as the United States withdraws overseas?

But accommodation/[retrenchment]{.underline} also has some important
advantages. Foremost among them is that it **[avoids antagonizing
Beijing]{.underline}**: it is premised upon the idea that, all else
equal, [accommodation is preferable to denial because **denial activates
forces that empower hardliners**]{.underline}. [Accommodation holds out
the possibility of empowering moderates and facilitating China's
integration within a reformed version of the liberal international
order]{.underline} that has served its economic interests well. Another
advantage is that accommodation/ retrenchment is cheaper than any
approach involving containment. Retrenchment would reduce American
military expenditures while simultaneously creating incentives for other
regional powers to bear a greater share of their defense burdens. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could return to an offshore
balancing posture, which would allow it to redeploy to the region only
if China tried]{.underline} to overthrow the new version of the status
quo order by, say [launching a war]{.underline} in East Asia. But [by
not signaling status denial, Washington would short circuit one of the
**major causes of radical revisionist challenges in
history**]{.underline}, [thereby reducing the likelihood that active
onshore balancing would be necessary]{.underline}.
