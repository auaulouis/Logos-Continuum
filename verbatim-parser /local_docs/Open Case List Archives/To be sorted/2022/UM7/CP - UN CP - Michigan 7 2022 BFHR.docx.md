[The [focus on emerging tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} and cyberspace
as a novel domain of international relations [marks a]{.underline}
noteworthy [**evolution of the role of the United** **Nations
([UN]{.mark}) [in promoting]{.mark}**]{.underline} much-needed **[norms
for]{.underline}** common behavior in
**[[diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not anticipated by the drafters of
the original Charter. I argue that [[the **U**]{.mark}**nited
[N]{.mark}ations [is the premier, inclusive, and ideal forum
where]{.mark}** universally agreed-upon **[norms]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
areas of [emerging tech]{.mark}nologies [can be
created]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [that UN
Secretary-General]{.underline} António Guterres [is already leading a
concerted effort towards this goal]{.underline}. In May 2021, the United
Nations Security Council met for the first time to discuss the role of
emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) in peace and
security. The following month, [[the S]{.mark}ecurity [C]{.mark}ouncil
[met to]{.mark} discuss how to keep peace in cyberspace]{.underline},
also for the first time, [[usher]{.mark}ing [emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies [into the highest level of diplomatic
efforts]{.mark} at the UN.]{.underline}1 According to the United Nations
Charter, [[the **Council has custodianship of decisions on**
]{.mark}**peace, security, the protection of civilians, and the use of
[force in international]{.mark} [relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Member states spent US 1 trillion in 2020 to restore networks that had
been breached or to combat malicious uses of technology.2 [The need to
create a global cooperative framework on cyberspace where states can
increase their capacities and assist those who lack them is critical.
[The]{.mark} UN [Secretary]{.mark}-[General's]{.mark}]{.underline} role
is critical. He created a High-Level Panel for Digital Cooperation that
met in 2018--2019. In March 2019, he called for a prohibition of
autonomous weapons: "machines with the power and discretion to take
lives without human involvement are politically unacceptable, morally
repugnant, and should be prohibited by international law."3 The UN
Secretary-General has called on states to set limits on autonomous
weapons, motivated by the belief that the use of these systems will
profoundly transform war and drive humanity into a morally indefensible
realm.4 Based upon the High-Level Panel's recommendations, and after
consultations with academics, the private sector, governments, and civil
society, [Guterres recommended a [Road Map for]{.mark} Digital
[Coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline} in time for the UN's 75th
anniversary.5 [The]{.underline} Road [Map [aims to bridge]{.mark} the
[digital divide between]{.mark} developing and developed
[countries]{.mark}, [create]{.mark} [transparency]{.mark}]{.underline}
by [[curb]{.mark}ing the spread of [misinfo]{.mark}rmation,
[protect]{.mark} critical digital [infrastructure]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
protect]{.underline} people's [[dignity]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Road
Map also seeks to restrain the weaponization of emerging technologies in
general and instead require that such technologies be used solely for
the common good of humanity.6 There is admittedly much work ahead to
carry out the Road Map for Digital Cooperation, especially in the areas
of misinformation, the spread of hate speech, and the digital divide
between developed and developing countries. However, there is one area
within emerging technologies that has gained sustained attention in the
last five years: the first formal meeting of the Group of Governmental
Experts (GGE) related to emerging technologies in the area of lethal
autonomous weapons systems was held in Geneva from November 13 to 17,
2017.7 [[The proactive and preventive]{.mark} action-oriented
[role]{.mark}]{.underline} that the UN Secretary-General assumed [has
firmly [placed **the U**]{.mark}**nited [N]{.mark}ations [as the
cornerstone for]{.mark} global [action in emerging]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nologies**]{.underline}. For Guterres, [there are
[four]{.mark} significant [threats]{.mark}]{.underline} to global
security today: [mounting [geopolitical tensions]{.mark}, the [climate
crisis]{.mark}, [global mistrust, and]{.mark} the dark side of
[tech]{.mark}nology to]{.underline} [commit abuses and [crimes]{.mark},
spread [hate and misinfo]{.mark}rmation, [and oppress
people]{.mark}]{.underline} in an increasing number of countries.
Technological advancements are quickly outpacing diplomatic efforts to
regulate their use, and the world is not prepared for the impact of the
Fourth Industrial Revolution.

#### The counterplan bolsters UN influence, which solves [global peace]{.underline}. [Only]{.underline} letting NATO die allows UN resurgence.

failed: UN must be strengthened," The Daily Guardian,
<https://thedailyguardian.com/nato-has-failed-un-must-be-strengthened/)//BB>

[NATO creates an **unequal world** and **undermines the credibility** of
the UN]{.underline}. If other countries start emulating the example of
[NATO]{.underline} and create their own separate [military
alliances]{.underline}, this would be an **[end]{.underline}** to the
existence of **[the UN]{.underline}**. [This would]{.underline} also
[create a fertile ground for tension **all across the
globe**]{.underline}. [The Russian military intervention in Ukraine has
exposed the world's inability to control the situation if a powerful
State decides to use its military power]{.underline} to set things right
with its immediate neighbouring countries. [The prime reason for this
massive failure is the absence of a moral and righteous world
body]{.underline} that has the mechanism to implement dharma-based
order. **[NATO clearly does not fit the bill]{.underline}**. The only
organisation that could do this is the United Nations but it has got
weakened due to shadow boxing by major world powers---the Big Five that
includes the US, the UK, France, China and Russia. They trust their own
military strength and have no reason to strengthen the UN. The veto
enjoyed by them ensures that this body remains defunct to prevent any
major crisis involving any of these players. All these five have
developed sophisticated weaponry and are major suppliers of arms across
the world. [NATO cannot replace the UN since it is a group of countries
having a **vested interest** to empower itself and maintain superiority
vis-a-vis other countries]{.underline}. [The world does not matter to
NATO countries if they are not involved in acts of war with non-NATO
countries]{.underline}. And if push comes to shove [NATO can fight any
country]{.underline} or grouping in the world [based on its combined
military strength and economic might]{.underline}. At least NATO would
like to believe this. The fact that three permanent members of the UN
Security with veto are members of the **[NATO]{.underline}**---France,
the UK and the US---makes it evident that [the organisation seeks to be
happy with its own enclave]{.underline} where they would enjoy liberty,
freedom and democracy [and]{.underline} will also have the wherewithal
to **[fight others]{.underline}** if these are hurt. Even in the vastly
interdependent and integrated world, NATO believes that it can live
peacefully even if other countries suffer. [The UN has 193 members which
means that **163** **countries** are outside the NATO
framework]{.underline}. Becoming a member of NATO brings in security
plus economic empowerment. Actually, the strategy of the British Empire
where the military back-up by the Crown was used to further business
interests has been emulated by NATO. NATO would intervene if its
economic interest is hurt or if it concludes that certain actions of any
country are hurting its core held principles. The massive airpower would
ensure that NATO troops would not even need to be on the ground if it
desires to punish a country. The control over English media by NATO
countries both in terms of finance, governmental control and ideology
would ensure that a larger legitimacy is provided to its actions. The US
intervention in Afghanistan was justified as much as its withdrawal that
happened after two decades. The US intervened in Iraq to destroy weapons
of mass destruction but when it did not find any, it blamed intelligence
failure. The UN has been relegated to providing legitimacy to the course
of action decided by NATO. These NATO countries have enough clout
because of their influence and are able to lobby successfully at the UN
and get the support of smaller countries to add to their legitimacy. One
wonders why was NATO not disbanded with the collapse of the Warsaw
Pact---a military alliance of former communist countries with the
erstwhile USSR as the fulcrum. Both the Warsaw Pact and the NATO were
offshoots of the Cold war and hence when the Warsaw Pact was dissolved
in 1991, NATO should have followed the same course. On the contrary,
NATO expanded by inducting former Soviets into it. [NATO creates an
**unequal world** and **undermines the credibility** of the
UN]{.underline}. If other countries start emulating the example of
[NATO]{.underline} and create their own separate **[military
alliances]{.underline}**, this would be an end to the existence of the
UN. This would also create fertile ground for tension all across the
globe. The world would be **[divide]{.underline}**d [into exclusive
economic and military blocs]{.underline}. [Ukraine should serve as a
lesson to NATO that it **cannot do anything**]{.underline} in a war-like
situation with a powerful country. Some members of NATO are now
realising that economic sanctions are going to hurt their own interests
more than the interest of Russia. Had NATO not given false confidence to
Ukraine and provoked it to seek NATO membership, the present crisis
could have been avoided. You can appreciate the security concerns of
other countries only when you understand the vulnerabilities. If you are
strongly protected by the umbrella of a powerful security alliance you
would not feel the pinch. Ukraine was the best as a buffer country
between Russia and Western Europe. When Ukraine was forced to abandon
its nuclear arsenals all the powers had ensured that it would stay safe
and secure and the world would stand guarantee to its neutrality.
Sending arms to that country and trying to influence it to become a
member of the European Union and then NATO was a violation of that
charter. Russian intervention in Ukraine cannot be justified in today's
world and any issue of provocation must be resolved through dialogues.
But when unbiased history would be written about this crisis, one would
not be able to ignore the fact that Russian overtures to talks were
spurned by an overconfident NATO led by the US. Was it not provoked to
use its military might to set things right from Russia's perspective?
NATO must ponder over this. The high-sounding words trying to bulldoze
Russian President Vladimir Putin have proved to be hollow. NATO cannot
get into direct war with Russia since the threat of nuclear weapons
poses threat to the entire humanity. [The need for a stronger UN **was
never felt more acutely** than it is today]{.underline}. Panic gripped
the world when on 4 March, the Russian military fired at the power units
of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant---the largest nuclear facility
in Europe. Energoatom which operates nuclear plants in Ukraine appealed
to the world community saying that heavy shelling at the nuclear plants
was "a severe violation of nuclear and radiation safety which can lead
to hard and tragic consequences for the whole world!" **[The world had
woken up]{.underline}** to the warning that it could witness a tragedy
worst than that of Chernobyl. Those who may have forgotten must know
what Chernobyl disaster a nuclear accident that happened on 26 April
1984 during a routine checking at one of the nuclear plants at
Chernobyl. This generated more radioactive radiation than the two bombs
that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Chernobyl and areas around
it were evacuated and largescale relocation of the population took place
in affected areas. The radiation led to people getting various diseases,
particularly thyroid cancer. An area of 30 sq km around the plant is now
made an exclusion zone where people cannot visit. Close to 150,000 Sq
Kms of land area in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine were supposed to have
been contaminated. Has the world evolved any mechanism to take care of
such eventualities? You can blame one country or the other for the
tragedy but who will be responsible for the largescale death and
devastation resulting from this no gain blame game. Who is responsible
for the death and destruction in Ukraine? The US, NATO or Russia? Or is
it the entire world that failed to take corrective action in time?
Whether a war or economic sanctions, the result is the same. The common
people who have no role suffer the most. If we call ourselves civilised
why can't we evolve a strong mechanism for peaceful resolution of
disputes? There are few hotspots of the world and immediate attention
must be given to them so that rival territorial claims do not become a
reason for military conquest. [The UN is the **only institution** that
promises hope]{.underline}. [A larger role to the UN means
that]{.underline} all **[military]{.underline}**
**[alliances]{.underline}** or such pacts between countries **[must be
dismantled]{.underline}**. **[The UN must be strengthened]{.underline}**
to use force too if and when needed---not only for peacekeeping but also
for bringing an errant country to sense. One factor that has made the UN
almost non-functional in matters of such conflict is the power of the
veto. Why should any country have a veto?

### 2NC -- Solvency -- General

#### UNSC's unique normative authority keeps countries in line

**Sonnback, 20** (Anette Sonnback, Co-founder and director of A Path for
Europe, 11-8-2020, \"How Successful Has the UN Been in Maintaining
International Peace and Security?,\" E-International Relations,
<https://www.e-ir.info/2020/11/08/how-successful-has-the-un-been-in-maintaining-international-peace-and-security/>,
LASA-CSK)

**[The active presence of the UN]{.underline}** in the world through its
different missions [**has resolved disputes, inhibited escalation of
conflict and spurred peace**]{.underline} in some situations, but the
inherent problems that were highlighted continue to attract criticism.
The failure of the UN to foster long-term peace in settings with complex
conflict-dynamics shows an important limitation to the claim to success
(Sambanis 2008: 29). **[An]{.underline}** alternative
**[area]{.underline}** in which its role as a peace and security
defender has been more successful, and in my view [**most successful, is
through the spread important norms**]{.underline} that have ranged [from
expanding the security agenda to upholding a nuclear taboo]{.underline}.
A telling example is the role of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT). As authors such as Scott Sagan argue, norms embedded in the NPT
shape "states' identities and expectations and even powerful actors
\[become\] constrained by the norms they \[have\] created" (Sagan 1997:
76). [The NPT]{.underline} regime [helped establish shared
understandings of]{.underline} what was considered [prestigious,
legitimate or delegitimate and states]{.underline} thereby [chose to
disarm]{.underline} rather than be classified as [rogue
nations]{.underline} by the international community (Sagan 1997: 80).
**[It]{.underline}** has also **[constrained both Russia and the
US]{.underline}** in their attempts to modernize their arsenals. [Even
in cases where the norm has been contested]{.underline}, such as when US
recognized India as a nuclear weapons state, [it never seriously
challenged the core assumptions of the nuclear non-proliferation
norm]{.underline} (Carranza 2019: 14). [Critics would]{.underline}
disagree and [argue]{.underline} that the accomplishments in the area of
[nuclear disarmament has been weak]{.underline}, as with collective
security (MacKenzie 2015: 489), **[but the UN's efforts
have]{.underline}** evidently **[hindered armament and]{.underline}**
possible **[escalation, pointing to a major success for maintaining
peace and security in the world.]{.underline}** Beyond nuclear
disarmament, [there is also the shared understanding of illegitimate and
legitimate uses of force]{.underline}. **[The UNSC holds strong
authority]{.underline}** in this realm, [which again points to the
normative power of the UN in its role for maintaining international
peace and security]{.underline} (Mingst and Karns 2011: 100). Even
**[though tensions can run high]{.underline}** between states in the
Security Council, this **[shared understanding has
enhanced]{.underline}** the **[risks]{.underline}** that **[an aggressor
might face when "breaking"]{.underline}** these **[norms]{.underline}**,
as [the response from the international community can take the form of
international condemnation, coordinated sanctions or]{.underline} even
[humanitarian intervention]{.underline}. This last point particularly
derives from the enhanced focus on human rights and human security
within the UN, as well as the shifting nature of war after the Cold War
(Bellamy 2013: 488). The principles of sovereignty and non-interference
came into question with the atrocities committed during intrastate
conflicts such as in Rwanda and Bosnia. The "responsibility to protect"
principle (R2P) was thereby born during the 2005 World Summit, which
came to mean that all states have a responsibility to protect civilians
from genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes or crimes against humanity
(UN 2020b). In cases where a state couldn't or wouldn't fulfil this
function, humanitarian intervention by the international community would
be legitimate. This is in line with the human security agenda that was
promoted by the UN in the 1990s, as the security of individuals was to
be prioritized over the protection of the state (Hampson 2013: 279).
While it contradicts the thesis of realism with its focus on
self-interested states, there have been debates on this new role for the
UN and how successful it has actually been to use force to support human
security objectives (Hampson 2013: 286). One main criticism is about the
questions of interpretation. Who dictates when this responsibility is to
be invoked? There have also been instances where unlawful intervention
has been done in the name of R2P, such as in the case of Russia's
intervention in Georgia where they claimed to protect Russian citizens
(Allison 2009: 178). However, the [jointly accepted humanitarian
intervention in Libya]{.underline} 2011 [based on the R2P norm is an
important example that illustrates **how normative shifts driven by the
UN can bring nations together to protect peace and security in the
world**]{.underline}. [Both **China and Russia agreed to humanitarian
intervention**,]{.underline} despite their traditional opposition to it,
w[hich stopped Qaddafi from proceeding with possible crimes against
humanity]{.underline} (Bellamy 2013: 500). Beyond operational successes,
the fact that the international community has agreed to legitimize
action to protect human beings as such rather than states, and that
there is a general understanding that states should not stand idly by
while atrocities are committed, remain two key achievement for the UN in
the realm of peace and security. The naiveté that liberal
institutionalism has been charged with is confirmed by the difficulty to
cooperate in areas that are so clearly still part of the realm of
national interests (Weiss 2018: 178). Despite this, [history has shown
that **UN nations**]{.underline}, and the P5, [**are** agreeing on
important resolutions and **overcoming their differences**.]{.underline}
[States]{.underline} have also [act]{.underline}ed [in line with the
normative frameworks that the UN has promoted]{.underline}. The UN can
be and should be criticized for its inability to act where needed or for
its inability to stop action deemed damaging to peace and security, but
[it has an ability to adapt and reinvent itself in line with emerging
global challenges that shouldn't be undermined]{.underline} (MacKenzie
2015: 490). Such adaptability gives constructivism right in its
understanding that process affects interests, which thereby transforms
structure (Wendt 1992: 393). This understanding explains how [the UNCS
has been able to legitimize certain norms and practices, even when they
intrude into the realm of national sovereignty]{.underline} (Williams &
Bellamy 2013: 416). The UN is indeed the sum of its parts, composed of
member states with their individual interests, but [state interaction in
this institutional context continue to shape states' evolving interest,
enabling policy change that corresponds with its task of maintaining
peace and security.]{.underline}

#### The counterplan effectively imposes international constraints on the whole community. Ukraine proves.

[The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not only played out in
Ukrainian territory, but]{.underline} also [at an institutional
level]{.underline}, [with important international organisations taking
on a major role]{.underline}. This is the case of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}), the United Nations
([UN]{.underline}) and the European Union (EU). **[There are multiple
differences between NATO, the UN]{.underline}** and the EU - from their
origin, **[to their method of solving problems, to their influence over
international conflicts]{.underline}**. In the case of the UN, founded
in 1945, with headquarters in New York and 193 member states, it has a
deep-rooted social character. One of [the main objectives of the UN is
to enforce human rights, guarantee international peace and security,
defend international law and distribute humanitarian aid]{.underline}
wherever it is needed. [The UN, unlike]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline}
and the EU, [plays a mediating role in international
conflicts]{.underline}. With regard to sanctions, unlike the EU, [it is
more influential]{.underline}, as **[it has the necessary legal
instruments to impose restrictions on those countries it considers a
danger to global peace and security.]{.underline}**

#### That's specifically true in emerging tech

**Juma, 2000** (Calestous Juma, Fall 2000, \"The UN\'s Role in the New
Diplomacy,\" Issues in Science and Technology,
<https://issues.org/stalk-4/>, LASA-CSK)

In effect, national bodies that provide scientific advice do not have a
clear focal point in the UN system. [But as scientific and technological
issues start to dominate global affairs]{.underline},
[**ways**]{.underline} will **[need to be found to provide
a]{.underline}** forum for **[global consensus building on scientific
issues]{.underline}**, and **[the UN's ability to convene states and
other actors makes it a good candidate]{.underline}** for the task.
[Such a forum]{.underline} will not be a substitute for the activities
carried out under the various specialized agencies of the UN, but it
[will support the work of national academies as well as other science
advisory bodies]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- Solvency -- AI

#### UN has opened a path for ethical AI standards -- the plan infringes on UN authority

**Garcia, 20** (Eugenio V. Garcia, PhD in international relations,
senior adviser on peace and security, humanitarian and legal affairs of
the UN, 12-12-2020, \" Multilateralism and Artificial Intelligence: What
Role for the United Nations?,\" SSRN,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779866, LASA-CSK)

The UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation
(**[UNESCO]{.underline}**) [**has been promoting a humanistic approach
on ethics, policy, and capacity-building in response to**]{.underline}
emerging challenges related to **[AI]{.underline}**, including
philosophical reflections on what it means to be human in the face of
disruptive technologies. Playing a key role in this regard, the World
Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology
(COMEST), an advisory body created in 1998 to give policy advice for
decision-makers, pioneered workshops and roundtables leading up to the
publication of a report on robotics ethics, with a view to positioning
[UNESCO]{.underline} as [a valuable instrument for intellectual
exchanges]{.underline} on this matter. 44 Furthermore, the first
International Research Centre of Artificial Intelligence (IRCAI), under
the auspices of UNESCO, shall have its seat in Slovenia, aiming to
provide a coordination point, funding route, and exploitation
accelerator for approaches to the SDGs that make use of AI.45 More
recently, an Ad Hoc Expert Group of 24 [members]{.underline} was [tasked
by UNESCO to produce]{.underline}, in a two-year process, [the first
draft of a global standard-setting instrument on ethics of
AI]{.underline}. In a preliminary study released in July 2019, it was
stressed that AI is not confined to a tangible location, which makes
regulation of AI technology more challenging nationally and
internationally. [Due to]{.underline} their [transnational character,
durable **solutions need to be found at the global level**]{.underline}.
[A normative instrument on the ethics of AI should]{.underline} serve as
a means of mainstreaming universal values into AI systems, which must
[be compatible with internationally agreed human rights]{.underline}
[and standards]{.underline}, and be aligned to a human-centred vision.46
Some experts believe that UNESCO's contribution, within its mandate,
could be complementary to other initiatives under way, such as by the
OECD, but with a focus upon aspects that are generally neglected:
culture, education, science, and communication. [The definitive format
of this normative document]{.underline} (either a declaration,
recommendation, or a convention to be approved by Member States) [will
be decided by UNESCO]{.underline}'s General Conference by the end of
2021. However, a non-binding recommendation on basic principles has been
considered so far more flexible and better suited to the complexity of
the ethical questions raised by AI. Following internal consultations and
virtual meetings, the Ad Hoc Expert Group made available online, in May
2020, a "zero draft" of its outcome document to invite commentaries by
the public. [In addition to values and principles]{.underline} drawn
from or inspired by the consensus achieved in the 80+ published
frameworks related to AI ethics, [areas of policy action were given
special attention]{.underline}: [promoting diversity]{.underline} and
inclusiveness; [addressing labour market changes and the social,
economic, cultural, and environmental impact of AI;]{.underline}
**[fostering]{.underline}** education, awareness, **[international
cooperation]{.underline}**, [governance mechanisms, and AI ethics
research and development; and ensuring trustworthiness of AI systems,
responsibility, accountability, and privacy]{.underline}.47 The experts
of the Group are especially worried about the need for a
multidisciplinary, holistic approach, with due regard to human rights.
They mostly agree that [**the UN has a significant role to play**, akin
to a "beacon," empowering people and **increasing participation by all
sectors of society**.]{.underline} 48 Also important, [the]{.underline}
UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute ([UNICRI)
established in 2017 a Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in
The Hague]{.underline}, [with the aim of]{.underline} [disseminating
information]{.underline}, undertaking [training activities]{.underline},
[and promoting public awareness]{.underline}. Directed by Irakli
Beridze, [the Centre has been active in cybercrime, law
enforcement]{.underline} (in partnership with Interpol), [criminal
justice, counterterrorism, and malicious use of AI]{.underline} from the
perspective of its mandate. In 2018, the website "AI & Global
Governance" of the Centre for Policy Research of the United Nations
University (UNU[)]{.underline} began to publish online crossdisciplinary
insights and "inform existing debates from the lens of multilateralism,"
as a tool for Member States, multilateral agencies, funds, programs, and
other partners.49 Other noteworthy activities include the following:
[research on AI-related technologies conducted by the UN]{.underline}
Institute for Disarmament Research ([UNIDIR]{.underline}); the UN
Innovation Network, connecting a collaborative community within the UN
system; [the Innovation Cell of the UN]{.underline} Department of
Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), [aimed at incubating and
leveraging use cases in peace and security]{.underline}; as well as a
myriad of projects developed by UN agencies to apply AI in their daily
practice in the field.5

#### UN regulation of AI solves or lack thereof is an alt cause

**Fournier-Tombs, 21 (**Eleonore Fournier-Tombs, 5-31-2021, \"The United
Nations needs to start regulating the \'Wild West\' of artificial
intelligence,\" Conversation,
<https://theconversation.com/the-united-nations-needs-to-start-regulating-the-wild-west-of-artificial-intelligence-161257>,
LASA-CSK)

Naturally, the European Union does not have jurisdiction over [the
United Nations]{.underline}, which [is governed by international
law]{.underline}. The exclusion therefore does not come as a surprise,
but does point to a gap in AI regulation. **[The United
Nations]{.underline}** therefore **[needs its own regulation for
artificial intelligence]{.underline}**, and **[urgently
so]{.underline}**. [Artificial intelligence technologies have been
used]{.underline} [increasingly by the United Nations]{.underline}.
Several research and development labs, including the Global Pulse Lab,
the Jetson initiative by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ,
UNICEF's Innovation Labs and the Centre for Humanitarian Data have
focused their work on developing artificial intelligence solutions that
would support the UN's mission, notably in terms of anticipating and
responding to humanitarian crises. United Nations agencies have also
used biometric identification to manage humanitarian logistics and
refugee claims. The UNHCR developed a biometrics database which
contained the information of 7.1 million refugees. The World Food
Program has also used biometric identification in aid distribution to
refugees, coming under some criticism in 2019 for its use of this
technology in Yemen. In parallel, the United Nations has partnered with
private companies that provide analytical services. A notable example is
the World Food Programme, which in 2019 signed a contract worth US\$45
million with Palantir, an American firm specializing in data collection
and artificial intelligence modelling. In 2014, the United States Bureau
of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded a US\$20
billion-dollar contract to Palantir to track undocumented immigrants in
the U.S., especially family members of children who had crossed the
border alone. Several human rights watchdogs, including Amnesty
International, have raised concerns about Palantir for human rights
violations. Like [most AI initiatives developed in recent
years,]{.underline} this work [has happened largely without regulatory
oversight]{.underline}. There have been many **[attempts to set up
ethical modes of operation]{.underline}**, such as the Office for the
Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs' Peer Review Framework, which sets
out a method for overseeing the technical development and implementation
of AI models. **[In the absence of regulation]{.underline}**, however,
tools such as these, **[without legal backing, are merely best practices
with no means of enforcement]{.underline}**. In the European
Commission's AI regulation proposal, developers of high-risk systems
must go through an authorization process before going to market, just
like a new drug or car. They are required to put together a detailed
package before the AI is available for use, involving a description of
the models and data used, along with an explanation of how accuracy,
privacy and discriminatory impacts will be addressed. The AI
applications in question include biometric identification,
categorization and evaluation of the eligibility of people for public
assistance benefits and services. They may also be used to dispatch of
emergency first response services --- all of these are current uses of
AI by the United Nations. Yemeni men carrying sacks of food for
distribution. The UN World Food Program distributed food in Yemen, as
shown in this photo from Sept. 2018. The United Nations later faced
criticism for its use of biometrics in aid distribution. (AP
Photo/Hammadi Issa) Building trust Conversely, the lack of regulation at
the United Nations can be considered a challenge for agencies seeking to
adopt more effective and novel technologies. As such, many systems seem
to have been developed and later abandoned without being integrated into
actual decision-making systems. An example of this is the Jetson tool,
which was developed by UNHCR to predict the arrival of internally
displaced persons to refugee camps in Somalia. The tool does not appear
to have been updated since 2019, and seems unlikely to transition into
the humanitarian organization's operations. Unless, that is, it can be
properly certified by a new regulatory system. Trust in AI is difficult
to obtain, particularly in United Nations work, which is highly
political and affects very vulnerable populations. The onus has largely
been on data scientists to develop the credibility of their tools. [A
regulatory framework]{.underline} like the one proposed by the European
Commission wo[uld take the pressure off data scientists in the
humanitarian secto]{.underline}r to individually justify their
activities. Instead, agencies or research labs who wanted to develop an
AI solution would work within a regulated system with built-in
accountability[. This would produce more effective, safer and more just
applications and uses of AI technology.]{.underline}

#### AI tech standardization alone fails -- UN is key

Analysis of how the three forces combine around [specific missions,
technologies, and political narratives is vital for any UN
agency]{.underline}. In this context, we offer three additional
recommendations: The [UN commitment to a human-centered and rights-based
approach should guide UN poli]{.underline}cy into the 21st To do so,
**[UN agencies must be aware of how AI and big data can undermine
privacy and informed consent]{.underline}** as well as cause unfair,
[biased and discriminative outcomes through opaque processes of
AI-driven identification, profiling and automated
decision-making.]{.underline} All **[UN agencies should debate and
discuss these issues]{.underline}**, both internally and externally,
**[to push for new policies and regulatory measures]{.underline}** that
are **[guided by the overall UN mission]{.underline}** [and by the
agency's specific mission]{.underline}. [UN agencies need to establish
their own policies]{.underline} which ensure that all decision-making
within their agency remains centred on human rights and civil liberties
in this new era. In a UN context of hope that often emphasizes the
benefits of "AI for Good" to achieve SDGs, [UN agencies should
acknowledge and address the risks of AI and big data]{.underline} for
their missions that follow from often-overlooked or de-emphasized fear
and freedom narratives, [which may endanger the human rights and civil
liberties of the key populations each UN agency serves]{.underline}.
**[That can't be solved by technological standardization
alone]{.underline}**.

### 2NC -- Solvency -- Biotech

#### The UN is key to including Russia on biotech discussions

-- in other words, [secretly developing biological weapons]{.underline}
in Ukrainian laboratories. [The event incited]{.underline} heated
[discussion]{.underline}. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily
Nebenzya, evoked the specter of an "uncontrolled spread of bio agents
from Ukraine". His American counterpart, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned
that Russia's claim could be a pretext for launching its own biological
weapons attack on Ukraine.

#### The UN is the only way Russia and China will cooperate

the US denied such claims and accused Russia of spreading
\"disinformation.\" [During a UN Security Council meeting]{.underline}
on this issue on Friday, [China urged the US to be transparent and
provide hard evidence to clarify itself]{.underline}, after US blamed
China of \"spreading disinformation.\" The US has a long, infamous
history of using and developing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)
including biological and chemical weapons in other countries, so it
would not be a surprise if the US was engaged in such practice in
Ukraine, said Chinese experts. If the US fails to clarify itself by
providing credible counterevidence, the evidence provided by Russia must
be taken seriously, and Russia can further prove that its security
concerns are legitimate and reasonable as the US is deploying and
developing WMDs in its neighbor countries which seriously threatens the
safety of Russia and the whole European continent, analysts said.
According to Russia Today on Friday, **[Russia has called for a UN
Security Council meeting to discuss purported US-backed biological
weapons programs in Ukraine]{.underline}**. Washington has denied that
it owns or operates any such biolabs in the country, while Kiev insisted
that the facilities were only engaged in civilian research. [Moscow\'s
deputy UN envoy]{.underline} Dmitry Polyanskiy [announced the move early
on Friday]{.underline}, citing a Defense Ministry briefing [claiming
that the United States and NATO allies ran \"military biological

### 2NC -- Solvency -- Cyber

#### UN is key to set cyber norms because of Russian involvement

**Kiyan, 21** (Olga Kiyan, 11-26-2021, \"Establishing Cybersecurity
Norms in the United Nations: The Role of U.S.-Russia Divergence,\"
Harvard International Review,

LASA-CSK)

[The cyber domain is a relatively new]{.underline} and ill-understood
[area of international relations]{.underline}. W[hile there have been
attempts to relate cybersecurity to nuclear deterrence]{.underline} to
determine how to effectively regulate cyberspace, the contrast between
**[these two areas creates the need to establish a new set of
norms]{.underline}** in order [to truly prevent cybercrime]{.underline}.
While both methods create environments of fear and uncertainty, [the
secrecy surrounding cyberweapons as well]{.underline} [as]{.underline}
their [development by intelligence agencies as opposed to the military
puts us face to face with a]{.underline} completely [new kind of
warfare]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, as well as a growing number of
international ransomware attacks, [makes it especially important to work
on international governance]{.underline} [measures to better regulate
cyberspace]{.underline}. [Since 2004]{.underline}, **[states have
participated in UN groups to]{.underline}** help **[craft just these
norms and regulation]{.underline}**s. Most recently, two main approaches
have emerged within the United Nations. One approach to establishing
these norms has been presented in the form of the OEWG, which emphasizes
state sovereignty and non-interference in cyberspace when it comes to
developing cooperation in cyberspace. The novel nature of this threat is
demonstrated by disagreement on how to best regulate international
cyberspace to prevent the escalation to serious conflict. While [Russia
has pushed]{.underline} for the OEWG as a way [to encourage consensus on
cyber norms]{.underline}, European states and the United States
expressed support for the GGE, which instead promotes an open and free
digital environment as opposed to increasing states' control over the
internet. While a lack of consensus is understandable given the novelty
of cyber issues, the ability to agree on [a unified approach will play a
key role in determining how and whether international norms will be
developed.]{.underline}

#### Past vehicle cyberattack regulations prove the UN can do the plan

**UNECE, 20** (UNECE, 6-24-2020, \"UN Regulations on Cybersecurity and

LASA-CSK)

The [two new UN Regulations]{.underline}, adopted yesterday by UNECE's
World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, [require that
measures be implemented across 4]{.underline} distinct
[disciplines]{.underline}: **[Managing vehicle cyber
risks]{.underline}**; [Securing vehicles by design to mitigate
risks]{.underline} along the value chain[; Detecting and responding to
security incidents]{.underline} across vehicle fleet[; Providing safe
and secure software updates and ensuring vehicle safety is not
compromised, introducing a legal basis for]{.underline} so-called
"Over-the-Air" [(O.T.A.) updates to on-board vehicle
software]{.underline}. The regulations will apply to passenger cars,
vans, trucks and buses. They will enter into force in January 2021.
Japan has indicated that it plans to apply these regulations upon entry
into force. The Republic of Korea has adopted a stepwise approach,
introducing the provisions of the regulation on Cybersecurity in a
national guideline in the second half of 2020, and proceeding with the
implementation of the regulation in a second step. In the European
Union, [the new regulation on cyber security will be mandatory for all
new vehicle types]{.underline} from July 2022 and will become mandatory
for all new vehicles produced from July 2024. Together, [the EU, the
Republic of Korea and Japan accounted for]{.underline} some [32 million
vehicles]{.underline} produced in 2018, [representing]{.underline} just
over [one third of global production]{.underline}. **[Given the
widespread use of UN Regulations]{.underline}** in the automotive sector
around the world, **[the broad adoption of these regulations across the
world is expected]{.underline}**, among and **[beyond the 54 Contracting
Parties]{.underline}** to UNECE's 1958 Agreement. According to recent
research, the need to strengthen automotive cybersecurity will trigger
massive investments -- increasing from 4.9 billion USD in 2020 to 9.7
billion USD in 2030. The framework offered by **[the new UN Regulations
will spur significant innovation and new economic
opportunities]{.underline}** [among suppliers, IT companies, specialist
niche firms and start-ups,]{.underline} particularly in the software
development and services market.

its first substantive session]{.underline}. In what are sure to be
contentious negotiations over the next two years, **[government

of completing a global agreement]{.underline}** by early 2024 that aims
**[to facilitate international cooperation and coordination on
cybercrime]{.underline}**. Our concerns about the treaty predate the
first session, and some of these concerns were confirmed by statements
made by various States and civil society organizations (CSOs) during the
session. [While many States]{.underline} (nearly a third of U.N.
members) [initially opposed the treaty]{.underline}, [those same States
are actively participating in negotiations]{.underline}, with some even
taking up leadership roles. In the meantime, States, CSOs and other
stakeholders just submitted their written views on some of the most
consequential chapters of the treaty, and those bear close examination
as well. [The]{.underline} main [purpose of the first session was to
debate]{.underline} the [objectives]{.underline} and scope of the
proposed treaty, how it would be structured, [and]{.underline} the [key
elements]{.underline} it would contain. As such, it provided a valuable
view into where states stand on the potential treaty, what it may aim to
achieve, and its political viability.

#### UN norms are key to accountability of OCOs

**Meyer, 21** (Paul Meyer, 1-29-2021, \"An international response to
offensive cyber operations is long overdue,\" Policy Options,
<https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/january-2021/an-international-response-to-offensive-cyber-operations-is-long-overdue/>,
LASA-CSK)

[Unlike other]{.underline} forms of [military operations]{.underline},
[states have been]{.underline} extremely [secretive about]{.underline}
[their use of offensive cyber operations]{.underline} and to date have
only publicly acknowledged them with respect to non-state targets (such
as the Islamic State). State-conducted cyber operations have also caused
massive, detrimental impacts on "innocent bystanders" as was the case
with the state-originated "Not Petya" (Russia) and "Wanna Cry" (North
Korea) cyber operations. It is [the threat of wide-ranging]{.underline}
computer network [attack operations]{.underline} that [have
prompted]{.underline} what [diplomatic efforts]{.underline} to date have
been [made in the United Nations]{.underline} to respond. [Since 1998,
the UN General Assembly has been discussing "norms of responsible state
behaviour in cyberspace]{.underline}." In 2015, an expert group report
enumerated 11 voluntary norms that should govern state behaviour.
Prominent among these norms is the non-targeting by cyber means of
critical infrastructure on which the public depends. The 2015 **[norms
represent a good basis for elaborating co-operative security
measures]{.underline}**, but [the revival of "great power rivalry" has
led to a bifurcation of the UN process on cyber security,]{.underline}
with both the launch of a further expert group and the creation of a new
Open-Ended Working Group. The Open-Ended Working Group is considering a
draft report before its final meeting in March. Recently a group of
states have proposed a "Programme of Action" outcome, which would have a
political rather than legal status, but would enable the existing 11
norms to be codified and provided with institutional support to promote
their implementation. Specifically, the proposal would create a
permanent forum at the UN with annual meetings, secretariat support and
periodic review conferences. Importantly, it would
[consolidate]{.underline} once more [UN work into a single, inclusive
body rather than stumble on with parallel processes]{.underline}. [After
decades of UN consideration]{.underline}, [many **states**]{.underline}
and non-governmental stakeholders **[are eager to have]{.underline}** in
**[place a set of agreed "norms of responsible state
behaviour]{.underline}**" [complemented by an institutionalized process
to monitor implementation.]{.underline} Several non-governmental
stakeholders have been active in generating proposals for its
consideration. As ["accountability" has been a concept largely absent
from the intergovernmental discussions,]{.underline} ICT4Peace (an NGO I
am affiliated with) has proposed a "Cyber Peer Review" mechanism that

#### Russia and China are willing and key to establishing norms that eliminate space threats

**Skibba, 5/10** (Ramin Skibba, master's degree in science communication
at UCSC, 05-10-2022, \"Delegates at the United Nations Have Begun
Forging New Rules for Space,\" Wired,
<https://www.wired.com/story/delegates-at-the-united-nations-have-begun-forging-new-rules-for-space/>,
LASA-CSK)

Harris' pledge could be a key step toward negotiating new international
rules for space, [a process]{.underline} that [began this week at the
United Nations]{.underline} office in Geneva, Switzerland, [where the
first of four high-profile meetings is taking place]{.underline}.
[**Delegations** from]{.underline} some [50 countries
**have**]{.underline} [**come together to discuss** the **greatest
threats to space activities, including**]{.underline} from
**[satellite-destroying missile tests and space]{.underline}**
technologies that can be used as **[weapons]{.underline}**, **[and to
explore what]{.underline}** kinds of **[rules or norms could reduce
those threats]{.underline}**. On Monday, Canadian officials announced
that they're joining the US in its pledge. "[There's a good display of
goodwill and broad engagement]{.underline}. I think
**[there's]{.underline}** points of **[consensus on what needs to be
done]{.underline}**. We need to find common understandings of how
international laws apply in space," says Jessica West, a senior
researcher at the research institute Project Ploughshares based in
Waterloo, Ontario, who's attending the meeting. (Many representatives
from nongovernmental organizations and from the space industry have come
to Geneva as observers.) [In 1967]{.underline}, three emerging space
powers, [the US, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, hammered out
the Outer Space Treaty]{.underline}, [which sought to
encourage]{.underline} the [peaceful exploration of space]{.underline}
for the benefit of all peoples. But more than half a century later, [the
treaty's gaps stick out. It]{.underline} prohibits nuclear weapons in
space, for example, but [says nothing abou]{.underline}t other potential
weapons, such as [non-nuclear missiles]{.underline}, West says. Last
year, [UK diplomats got **the UN** process rolling, proposing an
\"**open-ended working group" to develop new norms for** **behavior in
space**]{.underline}. This week marks the group's inaugural meeting[; it
is start of the first major effort to craft such policies since the 1967
treaty]{.underline}. It will be followed by another meeting in
September, and two more in 2023. This week's meeting, chaired by Chilean
diplomat Hellmut Lagos, highlights how international laws on Earth can
inform the creation of new rules for space, so that negotiators don't
have to reinvent the wheel. "Probably aviation and the law of the sea
are the two domains that have the most similarities to outer space. The
laws and principles cannot be applied in a copy-and-paste sort of
manner, but they can certainly be analogized," says Almudena Azcárate
Ortega, a space security researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament
Research and a speaker at the meeting. She cites the principle of "due
regard"---basically an international Golden Rule---which requires
countries to be considerate of others' interests while conducting their
own activities. Flinging satellite shrapnel into orbit seems to violate
that concept. International humanitarian law---rules that apply during a
conflict between nations---state that one can't attack civilians or
civilian infrastructure. That could matter in space too. "You cannot
target a civilian object. You can only target military objectives, and
then you have to identify what those things are. A hospital or a school
is always protected, but a bridge or a communication center might
sometimes be military and sometimes civilian," says Cassandra Steer, an
expert on space law and space security at the Australian National
University in Canberra and a speaker at the meeting. The idea of
"proportionality," which prohibits attacks on objects that mainly have
civilian use and yield little military advantage, should be applied to
space as well, she argues. [That makes for a thorny debate for space
diplomats, considering]{.underline} the abundance of "[dual-use"
technologies]{.underline}, Azcárate Ortega says. "Dual use" refers to
things like GPS and Earth-imaging satellites, which have numerous
everyday uses but which military clients take advantage of as well. (She
distinguishes those from "dual-purpose" devices, like a robotic arm
intended for servicing spacecraft or removing a derelict craft from
orbit, which could be repurposed as a weapon against an adversary's
satellite.) [There's plenty of room for more norms in this
area]{.underline}, West says, [including rules focused on transparency,
such as notifying others when using a new satellite-servicing or
debris-collecting technology]{.underline}. [Russia's conflict in
Ukraine]{.underline}, which [has]{.underline} already [had repercussions
in space]{.underline}, is casting a shadow over the meeting. Earlier
this year, Russian officials pushed to postpone the meeting, which was
first planned for February, shortly after [Russia staged a]{.underline}
November [anti-satellite test that produced debris that nearly nicked
the International Space Station]{.underline}, and during the buildup of
their forces along the Ukrainian border. The war in Ukraine also
provided a glimpse of how commercial satellites could get embroiled in a
war and how satellite signals could be jammed or spoofed. For the past
few years, **[Russian and Chinese diplomats have sought to advance a
treaty preventing the placement of weapons in space]{.underline}**. But
they made little progress with it. **[The US blocked that
effort]{.underline}**, **[without offering]{.underline}** any
**[alternatives]{.underline}**. While no destructive weapons have yet
been launched into space, [Chinese and Russian fears of US weapons in
orbit aren't unfounded]{.underline}: Some US policymakers, led by
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have called for developing and deploying
missiles in space. **[The US has not been a leader on arms control in
space]{.underline}**, Steer says---until Harris' recent declaration that
the nation will refrain from anti-satellite missile tests. While some
delegations, including [China's and Russia's, would rather see legally
binding treaties]{.underline}, voluntary declarations that most
governments will agree to could establish a norm that might lead to more
formal agreements later. On just the first day of the Geneva meeting,
representatives from many countries had already spoken up about the need
for peace in space, including those from Mexico, Austria, Pakistan,
Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. The fact that delegations from countries without
many spacecraft are actively participating isn't surprising, considering
how much space security matters for everyone. Millions of people around
the world depend on satellites for navigation, communication, broadband,
and finance, Steer says. These spacecraft are vulnerable to collisions
from the thousands of known chunks of large debris that already clog
much-used orbits, plus the millions of bits of untrackable smaller
fragments. A conflict that begins in---or extends into---space,
especially one involving the US, Russia, or China, would surely worsen
the situation. The rest of the week's talks include presentations by
Steer, Azcárate Ortega, and others about terrestrial laws that could
serve as a guide as negotiators move on from discussions to
recommendations. If all goes well, delegates will agree on a consensus
document at the end of the week, which could be a starting point for
September's meeting. [While UN processes run slowly and can be
politically charged]{.underline}, Azcárate Ortega feels optimistic.
"This seems to be moving forward after many years in which nothing
really happened, or people talked but there weren't concrete proposals,"
she says. "**[All sides of the geopolitical spectrum are coming to the
table]{.underline}**. I don't expect everyone to agree from the get-go,
but [it's very encouraging]{.underline}."

### 2NC -- Solvency -- Enforcement

#### The counterplan fiats the whole UN, that includes the Security Council. That means the decision is binding.

LASA-CSK)

I thought this would be a good opportunity to write briefly to clarify
that [the legal obligation for U.N. Charter states parties to comply
with the decisions of the Security Council]{.underline}, [contained in
Article 24 and 25]{.underline} of the Charter, [is not contingent
upon]{.underline} the [Council's acting in exercise of its Chapter VII
powers]{.underline}. **[Any decision of the Security Council is legally
binding upon all U.N. member states]{.underline}**, whether or not the
text of the resolution explicitly references Chapter VII.

#### Security Council decisions bind all member states -- including opposing votes

**Divac, 5** (Marko Divac, 11-1-2005, \"Legal Effects of Resolutions of
the UN Security Council and General Assembly in the Jurisprudence of the
ICJ,\" OUP Academic,

Ratione materiae, [the binding effect of SC resolutions belongs
to]{.underline} the realm of [international peace and
security]{.underline}38 [and includes enforcement under Chapter VII of
the UN Charter]{.underline},39 [but is not limited to
that]{.underline}.40 Since just about [any significant international
event]{.underline} or situati[on can be characterized as a threat to
peace and security]{.underline},41 **[the scope of the SC's binding
powers]{.underline}**, if **[combined with an overriding binding
force]{.underline}**, would **[make the SC a]{.underline}** dauntingly
**[powerful organ]{.underline}**. Whether a specific SC resolution is
binding is determined by the language used in it, the discussions
leading to it, the Charter provisions invoked, etc.,42 all with the
purpose of establishing the intent of the SC.43 The precise content of
the binding effect is left to the SC itself,44 but the Court has found
certain 'implicit' legal effects and, inversely, put some limits on the
effects45 when these conflict with the principles and purposes in
Chapter I of the UN Charter.46 This limitation is too vague to have much
practical value in the absence of any organ competent to review the
validity of SC resolutions.47 Ratione personae, **[an SC decision may
bind all UN Member States]{.underline}**, **[including]{.underline}**
'those **[members]{.underline}** of the Security Council **[which voted
against it]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** those
**[Members]{.underline}** of the United Nations **[who are not members
of the Council]{.underline}**'.48 As for non-Member States, the most
coherent interpretation of a difficult passage in the Namibia opinion
rejects any direct binding effect.49 This interpretation respects the
basic principle that [treaties only bind parties]{.underline}, and
avoids the difficult question of whether the UN Charter is subject to
special rules within the law of treaties. [It]{.underline} also [leads
to the same practical outcome since just about every state is now a
member of the UN.]{.underline}

#### But, the plan [isn't]{.underline} binding on other NATO countries!

**Sponeck, 9** (Hans Von Sponeck, 2-17-2009, \"The UN and NATO: Which
Security and for Whom?,\" Nuclear Age Peace Foundation,

LASA-CSK)

**[21st century NATO incompatible with UN Charter]{.underline}** In
1999, [NATO]{.underline} acknowledged that it was [seeking to orient
itself according to a new fundamental strategic concept]{.underline}.
From a narrow military defense alliance [it was to become a broad based
alliance for the protection of the vital resources']{.underline} needs
of its members. Besides the defense of member states' borders, it set
itself new purposes such as assured access to energy sources and the
right to intervene in "movements of large numbers of persons" and in
conflicts far from the boarders of NATO countries. The readiness of the
new alliance to include other countries, particularly those that had
previously been part of the Soviet Union, shows how the character of
this military alliance has altered. In the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty,
[the Charter of the United Nations was declared to be NATO's legally
binding framework]{.underline}. [However, the United Nations monopoly of
the use of force]{.underline}, especially as specified in Article 51 of
the Charter, [was no longer accepted according to the 1999 NATO
doctrine.]{.underline} NATO's territorial scope, until then limited to
the Euro-Atlantic region, was expanded by its member to encompass the
whole world in keeping with a strategic context that was global in its
sweep. At the Budapest summit, on 3 April 2008, NATO declared that it
intended to meet the emerging challenges of the twenty-first century
"with all the possible means of its mission." It added that
[the]{.underline} 1949 [North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline} of the
founding countries had been ratified by the current parliaments and
thereby [had become international law]{.underline}. [This did not hold
for later NATO strategies and doctrines.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Solvency -- AT Military Key

### 2NC -- Solvency -- AT UN Bad

#### "UN bad" cuts both ways \-\-- the aff can only use force if it's supported by the UN, so their gridlock also undermines NATO effectiveness

**Daalder, 99** (Ivo H. Daalder, President, Chicago Council on Global
Affairs, 3-1-1999, \"NATO, the UN, and the Use of Force,\" Brookings,

LASA-CSK)

[Of the]{.underline} many [issues relating to the threat and use of
force by NATO that]{.underline} have [divided the allies]{.underline},
none have been as contentious as the so-called mandate question, i.e.,
under what authority or on which legal basis can NATO threaten or use
military force in other than a collective defense contingency. At the
outset of this debate, most **[[allies]{.mark} [believe]{.mark}d that
[NATO should not act]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in]{.mark} this type of
situation **[[without]{.mark} an explicit mandate or [authorization
from]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}** or the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Allied leaders
agreed as much [at their 1994 Brussels Summit]{.underline}: "[We
reaffirm our offer to support]{.underline}, [on a case by case
basi]{.underline}s in accordance with our own procedures, peacekeeping
and other operations [under the authority of the UN Security
Council]{.underline} or the responsibility of the CSCE." In recent
years, however, there has been a growing division within the Alliance
about the role and authority, if any, of the UN and other organizations
in legitimizing or mandating the use of force by NATO. Two competing
perspectives have emerged---[a French perspective that gives the UN
Security Council the primary role in authorizing NATO's use of
force]{.underline}; and a [U.S. perspective]{.underline} that
essentially [argues that NATO has the right to use force whenever the
interests of its members so require.]{.underline} The French perspective
is based on the notion that **[[the use force in]{.mark} [international
affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[by]{.underline}**]{.mark} a single
state or group of states like [**[NATO]{.underline}**,
**[is]{.underline}**]{.mark} ultimately **[[governed by the
U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations [Charter]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[The]{.mark} [UN]{.mark} Security Council is empowered by the Charter
to [determine]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[existence of]{.mark} any
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to or breach of peace ([[Article
39]{.underline}]{.mark}). At the same time, the Charter recognizes that
states have the right to defend themselves individually and collectively
(Article 51) and that [[regional]{.underline}]{.mark} arrangements or
[[agencies can]{.mark} [maintain]{.mark} peace and [security]{.mark}
within their region]{.underline}, [provided they do so [in a manner
consistent]{.mark} [with]{.mark}]{.underline} the purposes and
principles of [[the UN]{.underline} (]{.mark}[Article
[52]{.mark}]{.underline}). The first purpose of the UN is to maintain
international peace and security (Article 1) and one of its [key
[principles require]{.mark}]{.underline}s [[members]{.mark} [to refrain
from]{.mark}]{.underline} "[the threat or [use of]{.mark} [force
against]{.mark} the territorial integrity or political independence of
[any state]{.mark}, or [in]{.mark} any [manner inconsistent with]{.mark}
the [purposes of the U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}"
(Article 2). Given this legal foundation, it follows that NATO can
resort to force in self-defense, either of a member state that is
attacked or of a non-member state so long as the government of that
state requests NATO's assistance. The former situation falls squarely
within the collective defense commitment of the Washington treaty; the
latter, as the case of Bosnia demonstrated, follows logically from the
right of collective self-defense. At the same time, **[[NATO cannot use
force against another UN]{.mark} member [state]{.mark}]{.underline}**
without its government's consent if the action is not itself in defense
of another UN member state [unless]{.underline} the action is
specifically **[authorized by the UN Security Council]{.underline}**.
[That is]{.underline} the import of both [Article 2]{.underline} (which
prohibits the use force against the territory or political independence
of another state) [and]{.underline} the proviso of [Article
52]{.underline} which limits action by regional arrangements such as
NATO to those that are consistent with the purposes and principles of
the UN. It follows from this reasoning that **[[NATO can only use force
in non-Article 5 contingencies]{.underline}]{.mark}** either
[**[if]{.mark} it is [invited to]{.mark}** **do so [by]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}**]{.underline} state involved or if it is explicitly
authorized by the **[[UN]{.underline}]{.mark}** Security Council.
Accordingly, France (with support from some allies) has insisted that
the revised NATO strategic concept should explicitly predicate the use
of force by NATO in these circumstances on the Alliance receiving a
mandate from the UN Security Council.

[The UN]{.underline}'s General Assembly [has been the only truly global
public political forum for which all states are equal]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} has [provided a framework for]{.underline}
decolonisation and [the pursuit of the reform of international
institutions]{.underline}. The UN Charter has provided seeds for a claim
made on behalf of an alternative organising principle of world affairs,
namely for a democratic community of states, with equal voting rights in
the General Assembly of nation states, openly and collectively
regulating international life [in accordance with the UN Charter and
human rights conventions]{.underline}.80 Despite its many practical
shortcomings and problematic state-centrism, the UN has thus provided a
forum, constituted by legal procedures and rules, where differences have
encountered each other in a peaceful manner and where, sometimes, common
policies on a number of issues have been worked out. [**The
domestication of the UN by the US has severely damaged** both **the
moral basis of UN pluralism and the legal procedures and rules on which
the UN has been based**]{.underline}. After the events of the last
fifteen years, very [little]{.underline} of the [spirit of the UN
Charter is left]{.underline}; and **[NATO is seriously aspiring to the

to organise resistance against US heg]{.underline}emony in the struggle
[for transformations within the UN without becoming]{.underline} just
[another enemy for the US]{.underline}, given its economic privileges
and interests, its Manichean tendencies, and the entanglement of its
public politics with the functioning of the short-sighted,
self-referential and simulatory commercial media. It is likely that the
consequent confrontation would quickly bring any progress made to a
halt.

### 2NC -- AT: Multi-Actor Fiat

#### We meet -- the UN is [one actor]{.underline}

United Nations as an Actor in International Development,\" No
Publication, <https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/84089>, LASA-CSK)

Based on the analysis, **[the UN can be seen as an independent
actor]{.underline}**, [its]{.underline} many different [functions
and]{.underline} especially its [expertise in development making it an
authoritative actor in international development]{.underline}. The
organization is both supporting the work of its member states and
actively promoting ideas important to its own agenda. The ideas
presented already in the UN charter in 1945 are still evident in the
work of the organization and guide the work of the organization over the
often conflicting interests of the member states. The UN has various
means to affect the decision-making of the member states and, thus,
contribute to the development activities not only by regulating but also
constituting understandings of development. One of the most important
result of this thesis is therefore the abundance of action apparent in
the work of [the UN]{.underline} in development, presenting the
organization [not so much as an employee of the member states but as an
**independent, active authority**]{.underline}. The results, therefore,
are in line with the core ideas of the bureaucracy theory.

#### Multi-actor fiat is good for [education]{.underline} -- doing security cooperation through international organizations like NATO, the EU, and the UN is a core controversy with expansive lit bases

**[The United Nations]{.underline}** as **[an actor bound by
international humanitarian law]{.underline}**. Although for many years
the United Nations has been reluctant to formally recognize the
applicability of international humanitarian law (IHL) to UN peacekeeping
operations, the changing role and nature of UN peacekeeping operations
in the early 1990s made this recognition imperative. In discussing the
principle and scope of application of IHL to UN forces, the article
examines the main arguments in the UN‐ICRC debate; the UN undertaking in
the Status of Forces Agreements to observe and respect the spirit and
principles of IHL Conventions; the international responsibility of the
United Nations for activities of UN forces, and the relationship between
the applicability of IHL to UN forces and the Convention on the Safety
of United Nations and Associated Personnel. The article argues that IHL
applies to UN forces when they are actively engaged in military
operations as combatants, but that its applicability is
mutatis‐mutandis, [taking into consideration the nature and legal status
of the United Nations Organization and its capacity to be bound by its
provisions.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AT: International Fiat

together despite the fact [that]{.underline} they [have **very different
philosophies**]{.underline}: [NATO is]{.underline} an organization
[designed to fight war]{.underline}, if necessary, in order to defend
peace; whereas [the U.N. is]{.underline} an organization [designed to
avoid war]{.underline} in order [to maintain peace]{.underline}. In
other words, the effectiveness of NATO is directly proportional to the
amount of military force available for use; whereas the effectiveness of
U.N. peacekeeping is inversely proportional to the amount of military
force used.

originally [dealt with the defense of its member states]{.underline}. At
the end of the Cold War, in 1989, its mandate appeared to have been
fulfilled. Nevertheless, the NATO members wanted to maintain this
Western alliance. This launched the search for a new role for NATO.

Michael Tomz, Stanford University, 11-2012, \"How does the UN Security
Council Influence Public Opinion?,\" University of Virginia,

LASA-CSK)

[Publics do not have complete information about foreign
crises]{.underline}, and therefore [rely on domestic]{.underline} [and
international actors for cues about]{.underline} the appropriate [course
of action]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [UNSC]{.underline} could [play
an important role]{.underline} in this process. **[By authorizing the
use of force, the UNSC]{.underline}** could **[convince domestic
audiences that there must be a good case for military
action]{.underline}**. [A UNSC resolution could change]{.underline}
peoples' [estimates about the material costs and benefits of using
force]{.underline}. An affirmative UNSC vote could [help
convince]{.underline} domestic audiences [that the foreign crisis is
genuine and severe]{.underline}, such that failure to take military
action could threaten the material interests of the United States and/or
other countries. An affirmative vote could also [suggest that the human
and financial costs of military action would be low,]{.underline} either
in absolute terms or relative to the anticipated benefits. Finally, an
affirmative vote could [signal]{.underline} to domestic audiences [that
the probability of military success would be high]{.underline}, or at
least sufficiently likely to warrant a positive recommendation. In all
these ways, **[a UNSC resolution could alter the public's calculations
about whether the benefits of war would outweigh the
costs]{.underline}**. A UNSC resolution could [also signal that military
action would be morally appropriate]{.underline}, independent of the
material costs and benefits. A positive vote in the Security Council
could be seen as confirmation that some country has committed a moral
wrong, such as an act of aggression against its own citizens or a
foreign target, and that the international community has a duty to
respond. [The vote]{.underline} might also [suggest that war would be
"fair]{.underline}" -- [an action to which nearly all countries could
consent, rather than a war that would serve the parochial interests of
particular countrie]{.underline}s. Finally[, a war undertaken with the
blessing of the UNSC would be legal]{.underline}, [whereas war without
UNSC approval might be seen as a (]{.underline}potentially immoral[)
violation of international law.]{.underline} Thus, UNSC resolutions
could prove influential not only by conveying information about material
costs and benefits, but also by signaling whether military action would
be morally justified.

#### Public faith in UN burden sharing is high

**Tingley and Tomz, 12** (Dustin Tingley, Harvard University, and

LASA-CSK)

[UNSC resolutions]{.underline} could [affect public opinion]{.underline}
not only by signaling that military action is warranted, but also [by
implying that **other countries will share the burden**]{.underline}.
[Citizens]{.underline} may [think the likelihood of success is higher if
countries fight collectively]{.underline} than if their own country acts
alone. Moreover, [citizens may expect to pay less if coalition partners
share the human and financial costs of defeating an
adversary]{.underline}. For these reasons, [the public should be more
enthusiastic when they believe that other countries will
help]{.underline}. By raising expectations about multilateral action,
**[UNSC resolutions]{.underline}** could, [therefore]{.underline},
**[increase public support]{.underline}** for war. If UNSC resolutions
sway public opinion by signaling that other countries will contribute,
several patterns should appear in the data. First, [the belief that
other countries will contribute]{.underline} should be [higher when the
UNSC has voted for war than when it has not]{.underline}. Second,
[public expectations about the human and financial costs of
war]{.underline} should be [lower]{.underline}, and [public expectations
about the probability of success]{.underline} should be
[higher]{.underline}, when the UNSC has voted for war than when it has
not.

[In contrast to]{.underline} the **[NATO]{.underline}** treaty (that is,
the North Atlantic Treaty as it was written, not as some in Washington
might wish to reinvent it), **[the U.N.]{.underline}** Charter [creates
a **comprehensive** security organization]{.underline}. [The North
Atlantic Treaty is quite intentionally one-dimensional]{.underline}:
[responding collectively to an \"armed attack\" upon the home territory
of any of its members]{.underline}, in exercise of inherent
\"self-defense\" as recognized by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter (and
even that, only till the Security Council can \"take measures necessary
to maintain international peace and security\" in that situation).
NATO\'s mission is narrowly one of repelling illegal armed force
(against its own members, of course)\--the restricted scope that some
contributors to this forum would crabbedly apply to the U.N. as well.

[The U.N. Security Council\'s mandate is far broader\--dealing with ANY
\"threat to the peace\".]{.underline} [Add to that its functions in
peacekeeping, peaceful resolution of disputes, and the work of other
parts of the U.N. in building the economic and social foundations of
peaceful relations, and you have a multidimensional and comprehensive
security system]{.underline}.

Sure, it\'s weak and fragile. But [the notion purveyed]{.underline} by
some on both sides of the Potomac [that NATO should supersede the
Security Council]{.underline} and launch military operations against
other states on its own ukase (in order to get around the squeamishness
of Russia and China about intervening in internal affairs) **[is risky
and misguided]{.underline}**. The desire of some U.S. officials to get
**[NATO\'s]{.underline}** member states formally to assert such a
**[power]{.underline}** may (and, I would suggest,
**[should]{.underline}**) **[alarm]{.underline}** many contributors to
this discussion group. It should even alarm the few political leaders in
Washington farsighted enough to [think about possible
consequences]{.underline}\--e.g., the risk that **[nations outside of

LASA-CSK)

"[China]{.underline} always [opposes the use of force in international
relations]{.underline}." This boilerplate statement, frequently repeated
by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reflects Beijing's
long-standing, publicly stated opposition to the use of military force
[outside the limitations imposed by Article 2(4) of the U.N.
Charter]{.underline}. It is a fundamental principle of its approach to
international law and a significant feature of its self-portrayal as
neutral, peaceful state in contrast to the United States. Yet China,
which has repeatedly refused to criticize Russia's brutal invasion of
Ukraine, appears to have abandoned its long-standing legal and
diplomatic position. Beijing's silence on Ukraine may represent a
temporary accommodation of its most important geopolitical ally, but it
could also represent a meaningful shift in the Chinese government's
views on the propriety of the use of force. Either way, China's silence
as Russia blatantly violates one of its most cherished principles of
international law deserves both criticism and careful attention if it
also represents a shift toward a more aggressive and dangerous Chinese
foreign policy. [Since its admission into the United
Nations]{.underline} in 1971, **[China has emerged as a reliable
defender of the centrality of the world body and the U.N. Charter to the
conduct of international relations]{.underline}**. In a revealing 2005
position paper on proposals for U.N. reform, [China lauded the United
Nations' "indispensable role in international affairs]{.underline}." It
made such statements even as it rejected calls at the time to endorse a
"Responsibility to Protect" principle that would allow the use of force
to prevent humanitarian atrocities. [The U.N. Security Council, China
argued at that time, "is the only body that can decide the use of
force." This position is consistent with both prior and subsequent
Chinese government statements]{.underline}. For instance, even before it
joined the U.N. but after it had diplomatically split with the Soviet
Union, [China publicly condemned the Soviet Union's use of force in
Czechoslovakia]{.underline} in 1968. And unlike its current silence on
Russia, the Chinese foreign ministry didn't hesitate to call the U.S.
military action in Panama a "military invasion" that "constitutes an
infringement against a sovereign state of the third world and violates
the norms of international law and the aims and purposes of the United
Nations Charter." This condemnation was made even though China and
Panama had no diplomatic relations at that time, with Panama instead
recognizing Taiwan. A decade later, the [**Chinese** government
aggressively opposed NATO]{.underline}'s military intervention against
Yugoslavia [during the Kosovo crisis and **joined**]{.underline} only
**[Russia]{.underline}** and Namibia **[in supporting a U.N. Security
Council resolution that would have condemned NATO]{.underline}**'s use
of force. As China's U.N. ambassador declared months earlier, NATO's use
of force "violated the purposes, principles, and relevant provisions of
the United Nations Charter, as well as international law and widely
acknowledged norms governing relations between states."

Fourth, [amidst the growth of cyber capabilities as a destabilizing

international law to cyberspace]{.underline}. In 2019, [the
UN]{.underline} Open-Ended Working Group ([OEWG]{.underline}) was
established as a de facto parallel track to the GGE, mainly on Russia's
initiative. The agreement on the OEWG's final report reached less than a

on language and recommendations from the GGE, [has been
reached]{.underline} in a process open to all UN member states. However,
[major divergences]{.underline} on the way forward [remain]{.underline},

possibility that Russia further escalates its use of cyber capabilities

[some countries]{.underline} that are developing these weapons

other nations also objected. "We would have liked to have seen everyone

Future of Life Institute's advocacy program on autonomous weapons, told
CNBC. "[All it takes is one]{.underline}," she added. The conference
concluded Friday, with the group pledging to "intensify" discussions and
consider possible steps that are acceptable to all. [The fact that the

[The **overregulation of technology**]{.underline}, [though damaging to

**[devastating to developing countries]{.underline}** because **[it acts

likely to increase further the income gap between the \"have\" and
\"have not\" nations]{.underline}, which more than doubled between 1960
and 1991. [Poorly crafted regulatory proposals constitute a lose-lose
proposition for the developing world]{.underline}. Virtually [every
field trial of every new biotechnology]{.underline} derived variant of
rice, cassava, maize, wheat, sweet potato, or other plant [would require
an environmental assessment]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} schemes
would [divert scarce resources to the regulation of activities
that]{.underline} are largely of negligible risk, [send inaccurate
messages about risk to the public and to politicians, and impose a
\"tax\" on innovation]{.underline} which is based on the excessively
regulated techniques. [These]{.underline} approaches [also make new
products artificially expensive to use, test, and produce]{.underline}:
New crop plant varieties must be adapted to local conditions and the
expense of testing them would become prohibitive. [Thus]{.underline},
unnecessary case by case 834 [review would diminish the degree and speed
of technology diffusion to the developing world]{.underline},
**[developing countries would be prevented from participating in
worldwide technological trends]{.underline}**, and [the technology gap
that already exists]{.underline} between the industrialized and
developing countries [would widen further]{.underline}. There are bitter
ironies in the demand that the developing world adopt unscientific,
technique-based and anti-innovative regulatory approaches. First, the
clamor usually originates from regulators or activists in industrialized
countries who both regard Third-world regulation as an opportunity to
validate their minority view of genetic engineering as manifesting
unique risks and see prospects for becoming players on a larger stage.
Second, [such policies]{.underline} preferentially [undermine research
on]{.underline} precisely the kinds of low-value-added but im[portant
products that are most needed in developing countries-]{.underline}
safer and more nutritious foods, improved bioremediation agents, and
alternatives to chemical pesticides and fertilizers. At the same time,

In this note I contend that [the U.N. Charter fails to adequately
address]{.underline} non-state actors or [provide effective alternatives
to armed conflict]{.underline}. The question of how to correctly
classify these actions under international law then arises. Article 51
of the U.N. Charter imbues nations with the power of self-defense
against an armed attack.\[20\] [The ancient concept of an armed attack
creates]{.underline} significant [ambiguity when applied to the
revolutionary concept of cyberwarfare]{.underline}. The use of armed
forces and other similar definitions are inadequate in their
understanding of cyberoperations**[. The U.N. Charter]{.underline}**
also **[fails to prescribe appropriate responses to
cyber-attacks]{.underline}** [and splits appropriate action into two
categories]{.underline}, [neither of which allow cyber]{.underline}
[operations to be classified correctly]{.underline}. Current
[international law does not adequately address]{.underline} [the growing
problem of cyberwarfare]{.underline}. [Specifically]{.underline}, the
[blind spots created by Articles 2(4), 41, 42, and 51]{.underline} of
the U.N. Charter in failing to address cyber warfare, coupled with lack
of responsibility for non-state actors expose the United States to
significant risk.\[21\] **[The United States must be active in pushing
the U.N. to consider new regulations to fix these potholes in the U.N.
Charter.]{.underline}** Though some governmental bodies seem unwilling
to join the discussion surrounding proper international cyberoperations,
others leap headlong into the murky topic. The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ("[NATO]{.underline}") [has taken the largest step to
adequately define cyber operations and explain how international legal
regimes apply to cyberweapons]{.underline}.\[22\] In 2009, the NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence embarked on a journey to
produce a manual on the international law governing cyberwarfare, which
became known as the Tallinn Manual.\[23\] The project collected
distinguished practitioners and scholars in an attempt to project how
current legal standards would govern this new form of warfare. With its
primary focus on wartime action, the Tallinn Manual dives deeply into
cyber operations involving the use of force and those that occur in the
context of armed conflict.\[24\] In 2013, this text began serving as a
resource for governments and scholars in the legal field.\[25\] Almost
immediately after its publication, the group began work on a second
edition of the Tallinn Manual. Released in February 2017, Tallinn 2.0
expanded on the original version and added multiple provisions while
updating the original.\[26\] This manual serves as a background from
which I make many of my assumptions and conclusions.

#### Empirics prove China and Russia block all UN attempts at cyberspace international law

**Segal, 17** (Adam Segal, 6-29-2017, \"The Development of Cyber Norms

[The **prospects of** developing **norms** of state behavior **in
cyberspace have been**]{.underline} looking positively
**[bleak]{.underline}** recently. The Lazarus Group, which appears to
have ties to North Korea, is suspected of being behind the WannaCry
ransomware attacks that spread to 150 countries and hobbled the UK's
National Health Service. Russian hackers have been named as the culprits
in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and are
suspected of being responsible for blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016.
This week's attack, Petya/NotPetyta, first looked like a new version of
ransomware, but now seems designed for disruption and destruction. The
attack appears to have originated in Ukraine, on the day before a
holiday marking the 1996 adoption of that country's first constitution,
so early suspicion is that Moscow is behind the attacks, though this is
still highly speculative (Russia itself has also suffered from Petya).
[Despite the proliferation of state-backed attacks]{.underline}, for a
brief window, [there did seem to be]{.underline} some [forward movement
on cyber norms.]{.underline} This week China and Canada agreed not to
conduct cyber espionage for commercial gain against each other. Beijing
has now signed similar agreements with the United States, United
Kingdom, Australia, and the G-7 and G-20. In 2013, a group of government
experts (GGE) at the UN agreed that international law, and especially
the UN Charter, applies to state activity cyberspace. In 2015, the same
group agreed to four peacetime norms promoted by the United States:
states should not interfere with each other's critical infrastructure;
they should not target each other's computer emergency response teams;
they should assist other nations investigating cyberattacks; and they
are responsible for actions that originate from their territory. [That
process seems to have reached a dead end]{.underline}. Last week,
Michelle Markoff, deputy coordinator for cyber issues in the State
Department published an explanation of the U.S. position at the end of
the 2016-2017 GGE process. Markoff's frustration is palpable, as she
writes the current "[report falls short of our mandate and doesn't meets
the standard that the previous GGEs have set for us.]{.underline}" The
sticking point is the application of international law.
[The]{.underline} [United States wanted to]{.underline} use the report
to begin [explain]{.underline}ing [exactly how international
law]{.underline} [applies in cyberspace]{.underline}, especially [in the
areas of]{.underline} the exercise of the inherent right of
[self-defense]{.underline} [and the law of state responsibility,
including countermeasures]{.underline}. [Other **participants
argued**]{.underline} that **[it was too early]{.underline}** in the
development of cyberspace **[to have such deliberations]{.underline}**,
**[and would]{.underline}** in themselves **[be
destabilizing]{.underline}**. They would be "incompatible with the
messages the Group should be sending regarding the peaceful settlement
of disputes and conflict prevention." Markoff does not call out the
[obstructionist states]{.underline} by name, but it is safe to assume
[China and Russia]{.underline} were among them. [Beijing has never liked
the idea that international law applies to cyberspace,]{.underline} [and
began walking back the 2013 report]{.underline} almost as soon as the
ink was dry. Chinese officials have consistently stressed the UN Charter
and the importance of sovereignty without mentioning the rest of
international law. During the 2015 meeting of the UN group,
[China]{.underline}'s representative [proposed taking out all references
to international law]{.underline} in the upcoming report. In the wake of
the DNC hack, M[oscow would certainly not support discussions about
countermeasures]{.underline}, which might cover U.S. reprisals for
hacking and information operations.

international peace and security, however, **[the relationship between
the UN and NATO is not hierarchical]{.underline}**. When the NATO
Charter was established in 1949 by the Treaty of Washington,15 it made
no mention of any relationship to the Security Council as a \"regional
arrangement,\" nor did it contain any provision providing for action
only upon the authorization of the Security Council, or for reporting
activities \"in contemplation.\" Instead, [the Treaty of Washington
expressed the]{.underline} [obligation of NATO\'s member states to be
that of \"collective self,defense]{.underline}\" under Article 51 of the
UN Charter and, correspondingly, embodied [only the obligation to report
\"measures]{.underline} [taken]{.underline}\" to the Security Council.16
[This formulation was adopted]{.underline} by the United States and its
NATO allies [because subordination of NATO actions as a regional
arrangement to Security Council review]{.underline} in advance [during
the Cold War would have subjected all actions to Soviet
veto]{.underline}. By **[characterizing NATO\'s military actions as

#### UN charter outdated and ineffective in carrying out effective policy

Nations,\" No Publication, <https://www.csdr.org/95Book/Boothby.htm>,
LASA-CSK)

Personally, [I doubt]{.underline} very much that [the U.N. should ever
be in the business of **military peace enforcement**]{.underline}. [That
is a task that **should be carried out by fully effective military**
**organizations, such as NATO**]{.underline} or groups of states willing
to do and capable of doing the job. Such organizations should first be
given political license from the U.N. Security Council under Chapter
VII; the operations should be halted if that political license is
subsequently withdrawn. But **[the U.N.]{.underline}** itself **[has
neither the military command systems nor the political cohesion to carry
out military-enforcement tasks]{.underline}**. Moreover, it is arguable
that [a U.N. that carried out military peace
enforcemen]{.underline}t\--except perhaps in the most unique
circumstances\--[would find itself in much political
trouble]{.underline} with its members. In my view, [**Chapter VII** of
the U.N]{.underline}. Charter, as [an authority for U.N. peace
enforcement, was written for a different era and **has little military
application to today\'s world**.]{.underline}

#### The UN doesn't have the scientific expertise to be effective

**Juma, 2000** (Calestous Juma, Fall 2000, \"The UN\'s Role in the New
Diplomacy,\" Issues in Science and Technology,
<https://issues.org/stalk-4/>, LASA-CSK)

[As a new form of international diplomacy develops to deal
with]{.underline} a number of emerging issues in which [science and
technology]{.underline} play a central role[, the United Nations (UN)
risks being]{.underline} [relegated to the sidelines]{.underline}. [The
influence and effectiveness of diplomats]{.underline} and international
civil servants will increasingly de[pend on the extent to which they can
mobilize scientific and technical expertise]{.underline} in their work.
This need not require the UN to acquire extensive in-house scientific
competence, but the organization--especially the office of the secretary
general--must learn to tap advisory services to identify, mobilize, and
use the best available expertise. [Although]{.underline} a large number
of [UN agencies, programs, and treaties rely on scientific and
technological expertise]{.underline} for their work, t[hey are not
designed to receive systematic science advice as a key component of
effective performance]{.underline}. In most cases, science is used in
the UN to support special interests and political agendas that do not
necessarily advance the goals of the organization. But this should not
come as a surprise. The UN was founded and grew to prominence in the era
of the Cold War, when much of diplomacy was devoted to dealing with
threats arising from external aggression. Today, attention is turning to
issues such as infectious diseases, environmental degradation,
electronic crimes, weapons of mass destruction, and the impacts of new
technologies, which in the past would have been the concern of
individual nations but have now grown to international stature. The UN's
capacity to deal with these questions must also grow. What is notable
about the [UN]{.underline} is that it [includes organizations that cater
to a wide range of jurisdictions but not to]{.underline} the growing
community of [science advisors]{.underline}. **[Even]{.underline}**
agencies such as the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (**[UNESCO) have done little to provide a platform for the
world's science advisors]{.underline}**. Specialized agencies such as
UNESCO, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health
Organization, and [the]{.underline} [UN]{.underline} Industrial
Development Organization relate to the UN secretary general's office
through a [bureaucratic hierarchy]{.underline} that [is not responsive
to timeliness]{.underline}. They are generally accountable to their
governing bodies and are heavily influenced by the interests of activist
[states. Even UN programs that deal with science-based issues such as
the environment have yet to place knowledge at the core of their
operations]{.underline}. [They have failed to take into account the
long-term implications of]{.underline} scientific advancement for their
[operations]{.underline}. Much of the attention in these programs is
devoted to territorial aggrandizement and not to the role of knowledge
in global governance. They are vestiges of Cold War institutional
structures.

#### P5 veto powser means [nothing]{.underline} gets done

**Koliward, 21** (Priya Koliwad, 10-06-2021, \"Is the United Nations
Still a Relevant International Body? --- The World Mind ,\" World Mind,
<https://www.theworldmind.org/home/2021/10/26/is-the-united-nations-still-a-relevant-international-body>,
LASA-CSK)

One of [the argument]{.underline}s [at the forefront in support for
eliminating the United Nations is that **the**]{.underline} most
powerful organ of the UN, the United Nations Security Council (**[UNSC),
is not relevant to the modern world.]{.underline}** The main evidence
for this claim is that the [UNSC only has five permanent member
states]{.underline}: USA, Russia, Britain, China, France) and 10
non-permanent member states. [This structure results in **misuse of veto
power**]{.underline}, often **[blocking key decisions]{.underline}**
that are [needed by nations with little to no
representation]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} also pre[vents developing
countries from being represented,]{.underline} which is necessary in the
present day.

Over the years, it has become clear that **[the Security Council's
permanent members have little interest in internal
reform.]{.underline}** Since this is the case, it is in the best
interest of the other UN member states to continue to push for reform.
With [powerful countries moving to unilateralism, populism, and
nationalism at the expense of multilateralism and collective
action]{.underline}, a united and forward-looking Security Council
capable of effectively driving the wider United Nations to achieve its
goals is essential.

#### Russia and China prevent Security Council effectiveness -- NATO avoids

**EL-Bawab, 4/26** (Nadine El-Bawab, 4-26-2022, \"UN Security Council\'s
inaction on Ukraine prompts questions on reform,\" ABC News,
<https://abcnews.go.com/International/security-councils-inaction-ukraine-prompts-questions-reform/story?id=84222703>,
LASA-CSK)

While experts said the U.N. facilitates diplomacy and keeps the lines of
communication open between major powers, [the Security Council\'s
actions are tied to major powers\' interests.]{.underline} [The inequity
of the Security Council is that **nothing can be done if it opposes what
the major powers want**]{.underline}, Poast said. While [the Security
Council has not been able to pass any resolutions regarding the war in
Ukraine]{.underline} [or act to stop or prevent it,]{.underline} Poast
said taking action is not part of its role. **[That is why NATO was
created]{.underline}**; **[to have a separate union, without China and
Russia]{.underline}**, **[allowing Western states to take
action]{.underline}**. \"One of the big things that drove the process of
creating NATO was the recognition sitting around late 1947 \[to\] 1948,
that, from the [British and the American]{.underline} perspective, they
weren\'t going to be able to work with the Soviet Union[,]{.underline}\"
Poast said, adding that the [powers needed a separate entity that would
enable them to take action]{.underline}. [Even in the early days of the
U.N]{.underline}., Poast said [there were concerns over]{.underline}
[whether]{.underline} the British, French and [Americans would be able
to work with the Soviets and Chinese.]{.underline} This was **[proven in
1999 when NATO took action in Kosovo, after the Security Council did not
act,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} again in 2011 [when NATO
intervened in Libya]{.underline}. \"[It\']{.underline}s also [a key
reason why we\'re seeing NATO be very active in this war]{.underline},
because of exactly the fact that [the U.N. Security Council has been
ineffective]{.underline} in doing anything about this. But [in
contrast,]{.underline} [NATO has been highly effective in]{.underline}
trying to do something to [support Ukraine]{.underline},\" Poast said.
