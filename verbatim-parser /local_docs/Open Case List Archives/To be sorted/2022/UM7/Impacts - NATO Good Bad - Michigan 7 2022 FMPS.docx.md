[Possible consequences of a rupture with established
arrangements]{.underline}

[Given the views of policy-makers and experts in NATO countries, notably
in Turkey and in some of the new allies in East and Central Europe, some
observers are concerned that it could be **deeply damaging to US
credibility**, **disruptive of alliance cohesion** and potentially
**destabilizing to European security** to withdraw the remaining US
nuclear weapons in Europe. Withdrawing the weapons could be perceived as
a **signal of US disengagement** and as evidence of a diminished US
commitment to the security of NATO Europe.]{.underline}

[Such a withdrawal would be **inconsistent** with the objective of
assuring US allies, and **not only in Europe**]{.underline}. [There are
connections between the US deterrence posture in Europe and US security
partners and interests elsewhere]{.underline}. [Australian and Japanese
officials and experts are, for example, monitoring US decisions about
extended deterrence globally; and they see US decisions about NATO\'s
nuclear posture and policy as emblematic of the US extended deterrence
commitment to their own security. A loss of confidence in the
reliability of the protection provided by US extended deterrence could
lead some US allies and security partners to consider seeking their
**own national nuclear forces** or to invest more in potential hedging
measures such as air and missile defences and/or enrichment and
reprocessing capabilities.]{.underline}

[The United States has been engaged in nuclear force cooperation with
its allies in Europe since the 1950s, and this half-century of history
has a **certain political weight**]{.underline}. [If the United States
unilaterally withdrew its remaining nuclear forces, the European allies
would recognize that **something fundamental had changed** in their
relationship with Washington. If the withdrawal was undertaken at the
behest of the Europeans, US political leaders could for their part come
to question the commitment of the European allies to bear their share of
the risks and responsibilities associated with the alliance\'s nuclear
deterrence posture. Withdrawal of the remaining US weapons could lead to
an **erosion of confidence** on both sides]{.underline}. [Some allied
observers are concerned that depending on offshore and distant US
central strategic systems to protect the European allies would not have
the same political significance as continued allied involvement in risk-
and responsibility-sharing.]{.underline}

[NATO\'s nuclear burden-sharing arrangements help to **maintain a common
security culture** within the alliance and to prevent a division between
the allies that possess nuclear arms and those that do not. The
involvement of non-nuclear weapon states in nuclear-sharing arrangements
creates a quality of engagement and solidarity distinct from that which
would be feasible without that involvement. The political dynamics of
the alliance might well change without US nuclear weapons in
Europe---and not for the better, in the view of some allied
observers.]{.underline} Over time the [non-nuclear-weapon-state allies
would almost certainly have less expertise regarding nuclear issues and
less influence over (and less insight into) US
policy-making]{.underline}.70 [Some allied observers fear that with no
US nuclear weapons in Europe, the United States might be **less likely
to engage in consultations** with allies in defining doctrine and in
making operational decisions.]{.underline}

In short, some allied observers are concerned that giving up the shared
nuclear response capability could weaken the bonds that tie the NATO
allies together as a security community. [Because the US extended
deterrent provides NATO with a capability that is jointly owned and
operated, there is a **high level of cohesion** based on shared risks
and responsibilities, particularly among the NATO DCA
states]{.underline}. Moreover, some allied observers maintain, some
current [non-nuclear weapon-state NATO allies cannot be protected from
aggression or coercion without nuclear deterrence capabilities. If the
allies gave up the current nuclear sharing arrangements and relied
solely on the strategic nuclear forces of France, the United Kingdom and
the United States, the alliance\'s nuclear deterrent posture could be
seen as **less credible by the non-nuclear-weapon-state allies**, if not
by potential adversaries]{.underline}. [A security gap dividing the
nuclear-weapon-state allies from non-nuclear-weapon-state allies could
emerge in the perceptions of the latter group of countries]{.underline}.
Indeed, if the British and French forces were reduced further, the
political gap between the United States and most of its NATO allies in
nuclear risk- and responsibility-sharing could be widened.

Moreover, [the withdrawal of the US nuclear weapons remaining in Europe
could be seen as a **break with the historic transatlantic bargain**
whereby the United States plays a leading role in return for providing a
security guarantee]{.underline}. [It could contribute to launching a
debate on the credibility of the US commitment to the collective defence
pledge in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty at a time when the
meaning of collective defence is being reconsidered, owing in part to
the emergence of new challenges such as cyberwarfare. Some European
allied observers hold that the complete withdrawal of US nuclear weapons
from Europe would be interpreted,]{.underline} at least in some quarters
of the alliance, [as an ipso facto weakening of the credibility of the
US extended deterrent. The implications for assurance of the NATO
European allies could therefore be profound.]{.underline}

[The consequences of the withdrawal of the remaining US nuclear weapons
in Europe would include the loss of the crisis management options
provided by an alliance deterrent posture involving aircraft from
multiple allies.]{.underline} This arrangement [makes possible the
transmission to adversaries of a political signal---one of a united and
resolute alliance---distinct from a US (or British or French) national
action. It is **difficult to imagine an alternative** to the current
arrangements for nuclear risk- and responsibility-sharing that would
provide equivalent benefits for alliance cohesion as well as assurance
and extended deterrence]{.underline}, but the examination of other
approaches may well be an issue in the alliance\'s Strategic Concept
review. [In this review assurance and extended deterrence will be
considered in a dynamic context involving other NATO policy
challenges---including missile defence, relations with Russia, the
meaning of collective defence in light of new risks, force
transformation (including aircraft modernization), arms control and
disarmament, and current operations, notably in
Afghanistan.]{.underline} The tradeoffs that may be made remain to be
seen.

### NATO Good -- Russia Deterrence

#### TNWs prevent a Russian nuclear first strike and aggression in the Baltics.

**Bowman and Gabel 19** (Bradley Bowman, senior director for the Center
on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies; Andrew Gabel, research analyst at the Foundation for
Defense of Democracies, 6-14-2019, \"The US must deploy a sub-launched
low-yield nuke,\" Defense News,
<https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/06/14/the-us-must-deploy-a-sub-launched-low-yield-nuke/>,
AK)

[To address an important gap in America's nuclear deterrent, the U.S.
should deploy **without delay** a submarine-launched low-yield nuclear
ballistic missile.]{.underline}

In its fiscal 2020 budget request, [the Trump administration requested
funding to deploy a low-yield SLBM in order to **deter Russia's
potential employment** of a low-yield nuclear weapon.]{.underline} Gen.
John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, testified in February
2019 that [this capability was "**necessary to our strategic deterrence
mission** and will serve to disabuse any adversary of the mistaken
perception they can escalate their way to victory."]{.underline}

Sometimes characterized as "escalate to de-escalate," [Moscow has
developed a war-fighting strategy and doctrine that emphasize the first
use (or threat of use) of low-yield tactical nuclear strikes against
conventional military targets.]{.underline} Such an approach would aim
to coerce the U.S. and its NATO partners into backing down and accepting
Moscow's new gains achieved through aggression. The 2018 Nuclear Posture
Review assessed that [this Russian nuclear strategy increases the
chances of "**dangerous miscalculation** and
**escalation**."]{.underline}

The bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission specifically
[addressed a scenario in which Moscow used false reports of atrocities
against Russian populations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to
**justify an invasion of these NATO member countries** under the guise
of a "peacekeeping" mission.]{.underline} In this scenario envisioned by
the commission, "As U.S. and NATO forces prepare to respond, [Russia
declares that strikes against Russian forces in those states will be
treated as attacks on Russia itself --- **implying a potential nuclear
response**."]{.underline}

[Would Moscow actually use a low-yield nuclear weapon against NATO
conventional forces]{.underline} responding to Russian aggression in the
Baltics? [Facts and prudence **do not permit ruling that
out.**]{.underline} NATO leaders would be forced to decide whether
Moscow was engaging in a nuclear bluff. [If the fear of Russia's
potential use of a low-yield nuclear weapon prevented a NATO response,
Russian President Vladimir Putin would achieve his leading grand
strategic goal --- the effective end of NATO as a collective-defense
alliance.]{.underline}

Yet, [if NATO did honor Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty and
responded by sending conventional forces to push Russian forces out of
NATO territory, Moscow might be tempted to **employ low-yield nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} if it thought it could get away with it. It seems
certain that some Russian military planners would assess that the U.S.
would not risk global nuclear war by responding to Moscow's tactical
nuclear strike with a high-yield nuclear weapon, thereby increasing the
chances Moscow might employ a low-yield attack in the first place.

Such a scenario may seem far-fetched and too horrible to contemplate for
many Americans, but [a review of Russian nuclear strategy and doctrine
makes clear that the Kremlin views nuclear weapons differently. As the
Nuclear Posture Review confirms, "Moscow threatens and exercises limited
**nuclear first use**."]{.underline}

In short, [assuming Moscow would not employ low-yield nuclear weapons in
this manner]{.underline} --- and making defense policy decisions based
on that assumption --- [would be both dangerous and
unwarranted.]{.underline}

[Critics argue that the deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons on
submarines would spark or exacerbate a nuclear arms race]{.underline}.
[Moscow has already **taken tangible steps toward an arms
race**]{.underline}: [The Kremlin began a comprehensive and aggressive
modernization of its nuclear arsenal years ago. Today, Russia already
possesses a stockpile of up to 2,000 active nonstrategic nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

[The question is whether the U.S. will **respond appropriately** to
protect Americans --- or unilaterally constrain its response and ignore
Russia's nuclear activities.]{.underline}

[Others claim that a low-yield SLBM is unnecessary]{.underline} because
the U.S. already has air-deliverable low-yield nuclear capabilities.
[That argument ignores increasingly advanced Russian air and missile
defense capabilities, as well as the distinct challenges a U.S.
low-yield SLBM would present to Russian military planners.]{.underline}

[Critics also suggest the deployment of a low-yield nuclear weapon on
submarines would increase the likelihood of nuclear war]{.underline}. In
reality, [fielding a low-yield SLBM would **allow the U.S. to more
reliably respond** at the same nuclear escalatory level. Without
low-yield SLBMs, the U.S. could be **forced to rely on vulnerable**
low-yield delivery **systems**, not respond with nuclear weapons at all
or use a larger nuclear warhead.]{.underline}

Based on a perceived reluctance of the U.S. to risk global nuclear war,
[this could lead Moscow to believe that its use of tactical nuclear
weapons might not elicit an effective nuclear response by Washington.
That belief --- and not the deployment of a U.S. low-yield SLBM ---
**represents the greatest risk for increasing the likelihood of nuclear
war.**]{.underline}

[Continuing assurance roles for US nuclear forces in Europe]{.underline}

[The assurance roles for US nuclear forces in Europe appear to include
the following: to serve as a **hedge against Russian recidivism**; to
**deter regional powers** armed with weapons of mass destruction (WMD);
to provide an alternative to considering dependence on French and/or
British nuclear forces; to offer an **alternative to the pursuit of
national nuclear forces**; and to supply evidence of the genuineness of
US commitments]{.underline}. Each of these roles deserves a brief
discussion.

[Hedge against Russian recidivism]{.underline}

The alliance\'s 1999 Strategic Concept dropped the \'strategic balance\'
language concerning NATO-Russia relations found in the 1991 Strategic
Concept. [It nonetheless included subtle references to the alliance\'s
continuing responsibility to hedge against the risk of backsliding in
Moscow, given Russia\'s long-term power potential, particularly its
nuclear forces:]{.underline}

Notwithstanding positive developments in the strategic environment and
the fact that large-scale conventional aggression against the alliance
is highly unlikely, [the possibility of such a threat emerging over the
longer term exists]{.underline}\... [The existence of powerful nuclear
forces outside the alliance also constitutes a significant factor which
the alliance has to take into account if **security and stability** in
the Euro-Atlantic area are to be maintained.]{.underline}12

In July 2002 Colin Powell, then the US Secretary of State, offered a
rare public acknowledgement that [one of the factors defining the US
nuclear posture must be the continuing need for a hedge against
potential adverse developments in Russia]{.underline}. In Powell\'s
words, [\'there are nuclear-armed nations out there,]{.underline}
particularly Russia, \[and\] even though it is a new relationship, a new
partnership---they will have nuclear weapons for many, many years to
come, and one cannot predict the future with certainty. So therefore [it
is wise for us, in view of that \... to give us a
hedge]{.underline}.\'13 It is noteworthy that US President Barack [Obama
included a reaffirmation of US extended deterrence
commitments]{.underline} in his speech on nuclear disarmament in Prague
in April 2009: [\'As long as these \[nuclear\] weapons exist, the United
States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any
adversary, and guarantee that defense to our
allies]{.underline}---including the Czech Republic.\'14

The role of the alliance\'s nuclear posture as a \'hedge against Russian
backsliding\' is generally not explicitly articulated in public
statements by NATO or its member nations in part because of the interest
in promoting cooperation with Russia in various areas, including the
campaigns against terrorism and WMD proliferation. However, [this
rationale remains pertinent and meaningful to allies, despite
differences in threat assessments. Allies in Eastern and Central Europe
are especially **concerned about trends in Russia** towards more
**authoritarian and assertive rule**.]{.underline} [Russian officials
have declared that certain new allies have made themselves potential
targets for nuclear attack by supporting US missile defence
plans]{.underline}.15 The [NATO allies have agreed that Moscow\'s use of
force against Georgia in August 2008 was \'disproportionate and
inconsistent with its peacekeeping role, as well as incompatible with
the principles of peaceful conflict resolution set out in the Helsinki
Final Act, the NATO-Russia Founding Act and the Rome
Declaration\']{.underline}.16 Officials of various allied nations have
expressed concerns, though they have been cautious in their public
remarks. For example, in December 2008 the President of Estonia affirmed
the need for NATO\'s deterrent posture in the light of the August 2008
Georgia-Russia conflict without explicitly mentioning that conflict:

The fact that [NATO is serious about its security has proved to be a
**powerful deterrent**]{.underline}. Indeed, [only an actor as
irrational as AI Qaeda has dared to gamble with an attack against the
world\'s strongest conventional, nuclear, economic, and political
organization]{.underline} \... As this summer showed us, the reasons for
NATO have not disappeared, but have in fact returned, if not with a
vengeance, then certainly with a strong taste of revanche.17

### NATO Good -- TNWS -- Deterrence

#### TNWs are key to deterrence\-\--they link US nukes together.

[The US nuclear weapons presence in Europe as a **link to US strategic
nuclear forces**]{.underline}

[The remaining US nuclear weapons in Europe]{.underline}---reduced by
more than 97 per cent from the high level reached during the Cold
War---[have been regarded as sufficient for assurance and extended
deterrence owing in part to the continuing link to US strategic nuclear
forces]{.underline}.37 According to the 1999 Strategic Concept, [one of
the important functions of the US nuclear weapons presence in Europe is
to provide linkage to the strategic forces that constitute the
**ultimate deterrent** to aggression or coercion.]{.underline} Ever
since the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957 and developed the
world\'s first ICBMs, [the alliance has been subject to periodic crises
of confidence---in essence, European doubts about America\'s will to
defend its allies, given the risk of prompt intercontinental nuclear
retaliation from Russia. These doubts have been aggravated whenever
Americans have expressed anxieties about US strategic capabilities---as
during the \'bomber gap\' and \'missile gap\' controversies in the late
1950s and early 1960s, and the debates about ICBM vulnerability in the
late 1970s and early 1980s.]{.underline}

Given this historical pattern, if a new debate emerged in the United
States about the adequacy of the US nuclear force posture for national
security, allied experts and officials would probably ask questions
about the implications for NATO---and for Japan and other beneficiaries
of US nuclear guarantees. The recent Perry---Schlesinger report suggests
that such a debate may be on the horizon.3 [A polarizing internal US
debate]{.underline} (perhaps stimulated by the forthcoming Nuclear
Posture Review) [could lead to public questions about the reliability of
US nuclear forces, and this could undermine allied confidence in US
extended deterrence]{.underline}. By contrast, [US consensus on
investment in sustaining and modernizing the nation\'s nuclear weapons
and infrastructure could support allied perceptions of the continued
reliability of the US nuclear posture]{.underline}. Indeed, [the
continued viability of what some Americans call the US nuclear
\'enterprise\' may be more reassuring to US allies than the overall size
and specific characteristics of the nuclear force.]{.underline} For US
allies in Europe and elsewhere, short of a grave crisis that would test
the resolve and operational capabilities of the United States, [the
overall health of the US nuclear enterprise and the US nuclear force
posture **remains significant for extended deterrence**.]{.underline}

[Deterrence of **WMD proliferants**]{.underline}

According to the April 1999 Strategic Concept,

[The Alliance\'s forces]{.underline} \... [contribute to
the]{.underline} preservation of peace, to the safeguarding of common
security interests of Alliance members, and to the [maintenance of the
security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area. By deterring the use
of NBC \[nuclear, chemical, and biological\] weapons, they contribute to
Alliance efforts aimed at **preventing the proliferation** of these
weapons and their delivery means.18]{.underline}

[If it is reasonable to presume that the alliance\'s forces include its
nuclear forces, the deterrence of WMD proliferants constitutes a
**second assurance function** of US nuclear forces in
Europe.]{.underline} [Statements to this effect have been made by
officials of allied governments since the early 1990s.]{.underline} For
example, in 1992 [the German Defence Minister, Volker Rühe, declared
that \'These \[nuclear\] weapons insure us politically against risks
that we cannot calculate, risks which might arise from the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction.\'19]{.underline}

[Various potential WMD proliferation developments could strengthen the
case for upholding US extended deterrence commitments in NATO and
beyond]{.underline}. The [acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran might
influence decisions in nearby countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Turkey, regarding potential national nuclear weapons development or
acquisition programmes.]{.underline} [Maintaining the credibility of US
extended deterrence protection might be critical to assuring the
beneficiaries of US security guarantees that they may safely **forego
pursuing their own national nuclear capabilities**]{.underline}. A
related policy challenge of pivotal importance is determining how the
United States and its NATO allies might deter Iranian efforts to employ
nuclear weapons.20

[Alternative to the pursuit of national nuclear forces]{.underline}

[The non-proliferation function of NATO\'s nuclear posture concerns not
only the alliance\'s potential adversaries but **also the members of the
alliance** that are non-nuclear-weapon states.]{.underline} The United
States discovered in the mid-1960s that [it was **imperative** to reach
agreements with its NATO allies, particularly the Federal Republic of
Germany, on nuclear sharing and consultation arrangements---including
Germany\'s permanent membership in the NATO NPG founded in 1966-7---in
order to be able to conclude the NPT.]{.underline}28 [The NATO
arrangements, including US nuclear forces in Europe, have served to
assure Germany and other non-nuclear-weapon-state allies that they have
no need to seek nuclear weapons of their own.]{.underline}

[These allies have, moreover, adhered to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon
states]{.underline}. Duygu Bazoglu Sezer, [a prominent Turkish scholar,
nonetheless pointed out in 1995 that \'The Turkish commitment to
non-nuclear weapons status is coupled with several strong qualifiers.\'
The caveats associated with **US nuclear commitments are perhaps the
most significant**:]{.underline}

[the strategic balance between the United States and NATO and the
Russian Federation must not be allowed to erode, by the former\'s
unilateral moves to the disadvantage of NATO, until Russia gives
sustained evidence that it has devalued the role of nuclear weapons in
its overall foreign policy,]{.underline} including its policy toward the
near abroad and their neighbors rather than merely in its Western policy
\... In other words, [the extended deterrence of the United States
**must remain convincing and credible** to Turks as well as to de facto
and de jure nuclear weapons states and potential
proliferators.29]{.underline}

It is noteworthy in this regard that in 2007 [US congressional staff
sought the views of Turkish political leaders regarding how US extended
deterrence commitments might affect their country\'s reaction to
Tehran\'s possible acquisition of nuclear arms:]{.underline}

In a closed door meeting, [staff asked a group of influential Turkish
politicians how Turkey would respond to an Iranian acquisition of
nuclear weapons. These politicians emphatically responded that Turkey
would pursue nuclear weapons as well. These individuals stated, \'Turkey
would lose its importance in the region if Iran has nuclear weapons a
Turkey does not.\']{.underline} Another politician said **[it would be
\'compulsory\']{.underline}** [for Turkey to obtain nuclear weapons in
such a scenario.]{.underline} [However, when staff subsequently asked
whether a U.S. nuclear umbrella and robust security commitment would be
sufficient to dissuade Turkey from pursuing nuclear weapons, **all three
individuals agreed that it would**.]{.underline} 30

Consequences

What these elements suggest is that a [new strategic fracture could open
up on the continent. A future US-German convergence for reducing the
role of nuclear weapons in the Alliance's strategy, which would be
supported by several NATO and EU members, would be **problematic for
Paris and London**]{.underline}. Also, [a unilateral decision by one
nuclear-sharing country to cease its participation in the process and
demand the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons could lead to an
**unraveling of the whole scheme** through the empowerment of
anti-nuclear forces in national parliaments of other countries. That
would put an end to a decades-old arrangement, often seen to be at the
core of the transatlantic bargain, the "sharing of nuclear risks and
responsibilities".]{.underline}

[The materialization of such scenarios would not be without consequences
on the political cohesion of Western institutions (NATO and the EU), and
would put at risk the very notion of a common European strategic
culture.]{.underline} Not only would [non-nuclear NATO countries be
**cut off from the discussions** about nuclear planning and operations,
but they would also lose the opportunity to weigh on Alliance nuclear
policy. Perhaps most importantly, this would also **affect the
perception by potential adversaries** of the solidity of these
discussions and on deterrence itself, **at a time when Russia
increasingly appears as a major strategic threat.**]{.underline}

In other words, [the traditional arguments for keeping US nuclear forces
in Europe **remain valid** in the judgement of many officials and
experts in the alliance]{.underline}. [These arguments can be summed up
as follows: US nuclear forces based in Europe **send a more potent

[Alternative to considering dependence on French and/or British nuclear
forces]{.underline}

[The hypothetical alternative of relying on French nuclear forces
instead of US protection has been evoked repeatedly since France became
a nuclear power in the 1960s; but **the option has never been taken up**
by the non-nuclear-weapon state allies]{.underline}. For example, in
1985 Manfred Wörner, then [the West German Defence Minister, said,
\'France\'s nuclear capability is insufficient to protect the Federal
Republic \[of Germany\]. We will have to continue to rely on the
American nuclear umbrella.\'21]{.underline}

Some Germans have argued that the French should participate in NATO
nuclear consultations rather than establishing a consultation
arrangement (as the French have intermittently proposed since 1992)
limited to Europeans, excluding the United States and implying that US
nuclear commitments are unreliable. As Karl Heinz Kamp observed in 1996,
[\'From a German viewpoint any European nuclear entity can only be one
part of a European-transatlantic security structure.\'22 In 2004 Peter
Schmidt wrote, \'For Germany, a European solution could only be sound in
the near future if it was **associated with the \[NATO\] Alliance\'s
nuclear policy**.\']{.underline}23 In 2007 it was reported that German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and her foreign minister Frank-Walter
Steinmeier had rejected French President Nicolas Sarkozy\'s offer to
give Germany a say in French decision-making on nuclear weapons.24

[Expert observers from non-nuclear-weapon-state European allied nations
have historically expressed several reservations regarding French
proposals for a European Union dialogue on nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}. First, the [EU member states have not yet made
alliance-like collective defence commitments to each other.]{.underline}
Second, two EU members that are not NATO members (Ireland and Sweden)
are among the countries that have long called in international forums
for \'the reduction of reliance on nuclear weapons in security
doctrines\'. In their view, \'the possession of nuclear weapons\' should
give way to \'nuclear disarmament and \... a nuclear weapon-free
world.\'25 As a result, the willingness of Ireland and Sweden to be
associated with an EU arrangement implying support for policies of
nuclear deterrence is unclear. Third, [some allies regard French (and
British) nuclear capabilities as **inadequate** to provide a deterrent
force to protect the EU and (aside from French and British national
purposes) useful mainly as a supplement to the US extended deterrence
arrangements with NATO members.2 Fourth, making France the guarantor of
the European Union\'s security would elevate France\'s political status
to a level unacceptable to Germany, Italy, and other EU countries.
Fifth, despite their repeated proposals, the French have in practice
shown **little willingness** to accept nuclear consultation obligations
and mechanisms]{.underline}. For example, concrete implementation
arrangements for President François Mitterrand\'s 1986 promise to
consult with the West German Chancellor before using nuclear weapons on
German soil evidently never went very far.27

[Rather than welcoming an opportunity to grapple with the demanding
political and strategic issues that would be raised in an attempt to
pursue the hypothetical alternative of depending on French or
Franco-British nuclear protection, the non-nuclear-weapon-state allies
have **preferred to rely on US extended deterrence arrangements in
NATO**]{.underline}, supplemented by the British nuclear commitment to
NATO.

### NATO Good -- Russia 

#### NATO uncertainty causes Russia to capitalize on their weakness -- the aff solves by unifying NATO 

**DeBski 22** SłAwomir DęBski, Opinion Contributor, 7-8-2022, \"The
wrong NATO signals to Russia could mean more war for Europe,\" Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3549231-the-wrong-nato-signals-to-russia-could-mean-more-war-for-europe/

[Since the USSR's collapse, the Russian Federation's strategic goal has
been to maintain a buffer zone over its western neighborhood that
includes NATO territory]{.underline}. A weakened Russia was unable to
stop the sovereign aspirations of former Soviet republics in the
Baltics, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. But [it demanded that the free
world recognize their independence merely as a tentative
fact.]{.underline} Newly revealed German archival documents reportedly
show that then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl exploited Russia's weakness to
unite Germany and opposed recognizing Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and
Ukrainian independence, while vetoing their membership in NATO and the
European Union. His successor, Gerhard Schröder, pushed for energy
cooperation with Russia and, after suffering electoral defeat, became a
lobbyist for the Russian gas giant Gazprom. Then, former Chancellor
Angela Merkel blocked Ukrainian and Georgian accession to NATO in 2008.
Former French President Francois Mitterand and his successors also fell
prey to Russian arguments against their membership. So, Moscow got the
memo that Europe's whole, free and at peace moment is temporary and up
for revision. [The Obama administration's unconvincing response to
Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 only emboldened Russian President
Vladimir Putin in his belief that the free world will comply with his
subjecting former Soviet republics. Russia also saw President Biden's
policy of halting two decades of continuous wars fought by the United
States, beginning with the immediate evacuation of U.S. troops from
Afghanistan, as a window of opportunity to change the rules of the game
--- a "green light" to relaunch a war of aggression against Ukraine with
a goal of exterminating it as a nation.]{.underline} Russia was unable
to stand in the way of former Central European satellites joining NATO,
but demanded that their membership status have a feeble character.
Unfortunately, NATO agreed to this in 1997. Assuming Russia's good will,
the alliance created a political declaration --- the NATO-Russia
Founding Act. In essence, Russia received a political commitment from
the alliance that it would not deploy substantial combat forces to new
member states. Moscow perceived this as a victory, believing that
provisional membership status for NATO's newest members could be
reversed one day, either diplomatically or by force. As long as Russia
pursued peaceful politics, the Founding Act didn't seem to be a big
concession. But Russia has shielded its weakness by creating holes and
hidden "gray zones" in Europe's security system to exploit and undermine
it whenever geopolitically possible. Russia's 2014 attack on Ukraine and
the annexation of Crimea violated all provisions of international law;
war again became a political tool in Europe. That was when the Founding
Act should have been thrown into the dustbin of history, since it was
unceremoniously broken by Russia. Instead, [some NATO members --- led by
Germany and France --- did everything possible to prevent the act from
landing in the rubbish heap]{.underline}. During the 2016 NATO summit in
Warsaw, buttressing the Eastern Flank was calibrated so as not to
undermine the Founding Act by opposing the stationing of substantial
combat forces in new member states threatened by Russian aggression.
[Russia received another signal that some NATO members evidently
recognize its claims to a sphere of influence, provoking it to act
aggressively.]{.underline} In December 2021, [Putin issued an ultimatum
to NATO and the U.S., demanding they give up their "open door" policy,
withdraw forces from the Eastern]{.underline} Flank, and agree to
legally binding limitations on military activity in the region. When
[the demands weren't met, Russia attacked Ukraine. It should be clear
that Russia exploits indecisiveness and wrong messaging, driven by
political wishful thinking, for its aggressive, imperialist
purposes.]{.underline} At its recent summit in Madrid, NATO formally
invited Sweden and Finland to join the alliance. Members adopted a new
strategic concept, labeling Russia a "clear and present danger." They
agreed to station more NATO and U.S. troops on the Eastern Flank, and
will have larger reinforcements than before. From the military point of
view, such decisions should strengthen defense and deterrence. But even
now --- [after Russia'ss bombing of Kyiv and Kharkiv, and in light of
atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha, Irpin and Mariupol ---
the Founding Act, which Russia has violated since February 2014, wasn't
denounced. Did some European allies object?]{.underline} Instead[, a
compromise formula was adopted --- "Don't ask, don't tell." But that's
not enough, as long as there is room for Russia to interpret that
respecting the Founding Act means allowing second-class status for
NATO's Eastern Flank allies. Remember, Russia understands indecisiveness
and a lack of will to act as weakness and an invitation for
aggression.]{.underline}

#### Russia's invasion of Ukraine is irrational and fueled by violent nationalistic desires, not NATO 

**Majumdar** **22** Bhaskar Majumdar, 6-27-2022, \"Russian Imperialism,
Not NATO Expansion, Caused the Ukraine War,\" Fair Observer,
https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/russian-imperialism-not-nato-expansion-caused-the-ukraine-war/

When it comes to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it is easy to get into
the popular narrative of the Cold War. Three decades after the collapse
of the Soviet Union, this narrative still lives subconsciously, if not
consciously, in people's minds. It puts things in easy perspectives: a
binary black and white, the US against Russia, us versus them. To quote
George W. Bush (Bush Junior), this narrative is simple: "If you are not
with us, you are against us." While the Cold War mindset might be
obvious, other modes of thinking are less so. A key one is imperialism.
In my naive youth, I had never believed that Americans would think of
their role in the world from a great-power imperialistic perspective.
When the Iraq War broke out in 2003, my impression was rudely shattered.
I met a doctor in Connecticut and told him that I had just come from
Kuwait. The good medic had never been outside his native state of
Connecticut. Yet he expansively waved his hands and asked me: "So how
are we managing the region?" I realized then that this attitude was as
imperial as the British one of "managing" India or the French one of
"managing" Algeria or that of any colonial power "managing" a colony.
Our good doctor was well aware that the US Army had a base in Kuwait and
the gateway to Iraq was directly through Kuwait. He assumed that the US
was responsible for the whole region as some form of a world's policeman
and sovereign states in the region had little say in the matter. Given
the fact that the US is the top dog as the sole superpower, it is easy
to blame it for neo imperialism and more. Yet imperialism is not an
American monopoly and it is important not to view the world through a
monochromatic lens. US Provocation or Russian Imperialism? [Some of the
popular narrative in many countries is that the US is responsible for
Putin's invasion of Ukraine, at least in part]{.underline}. John
[Mearsheimer]{.underline}, professor at the University of Chicago, has
popularized this line of thought. He [**argues that NATO's eastward
expansion provoked Russian** President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine.
**The problem with this argument is that it is curiously
imperial.**]{.underline} As per Mearsheimer's worldview, NATO in general
and the US in particular were at fault for welcoming countries that were
in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. Admitting the three former Soviet
republics in the Baltics was rubbing salt into wounded Russian pride.
[This view forgets that the Russian Empire and its successor, the Soviet
Union, expanded in western Europe as well as in the east all the way to
the Pacific. In 1979, the Soviet troops even marched into Afghanistan to
protect the communist government. None of the countries that suffered
under Moscow's yoke wants to go back to those. That is what so many of
them lined up to join NATO when the Soviet Union fell.]{.underline}
Eastern European nations also turned to the EU because of economic
opportunities on offer. [Poles, Lithuanians and even Hungarians prefer
to work in France, Germany and the UK instead of in Russia]{.underline}.
In a nutshell, [NATO guaranteed security against an imperial Moscow
while the EU boosted the economy for Eastern Europe.]{.underline} An
imperial view would see the expansion of NATO as a win for the US and a
loss to Russia. However, it might be a good idea not to think of NATO or
even the EU expanding east but Eastern Europe moving westward. "Go West,
young man" had a new meaning for Poles suffering from nightmares of the
[1943 Katyn Forest Massacre when the Soviets slaughtered the flower of
Polish society.]{.underline} Obviously, Russia did not like the eastward
expansion of NATO or the EU. For a historically imperial power, this was
deeply humiliating. In particular, the Soviet collapse scarred Vladimir
Putin. This former KGB officer ended up driving a taxi for a bit. As
Atul Singh and Glenn Carle write, the 1990s deeply traumatized Russians
"who interpret almost every US action and statement as pieces of a long
term, coherent plan to undermine Russia." Russia claims that NATO
threatens its sovereignty by encroaching on its near abroad. What Is the
Conflict Really About? [**The reality is that NATO armies have no
designs on Russian territory. It is Russia that annexed Crimea with
impunity and in contravention of international law. Now, it has attacked
Ukraine without provocation.** It is razing entire cities, killing
civilians and committing atrocities in a classically brutal Russian
way]{.underline}. The history and the current reality of Russia puts
fear into the hearts of its neighbors. [That is why Finland and Sweden
have applied to join NATO. Their action is defensive, not
offensive.]{.underline} US President Joe **[Biden may have been at fault
in Afghanistan but he is not at fault for Ukraine.]{.underline}** Putin
is the man responsible for this conflict. Running a kleptocratic regime,
this authoritarian leader needs to squash a democratic Ukraine. This
removes the risk of calls for democracy in Russia. If Russian forces had
taken Kyiv, a Moscow-friendly government would be in place. That was a
key objective for Putin's reckless assault on Kyiv. Unfortunately for
the new tsar of Russia, Ukrainians beat back Russian forces. Now Russian
troops are taking over the Donbas region and much of Ukraine's Black Sea
coast so that Russia has a land route to Crimea. Putin's constant
references to history are self-serving justifications and too clever by
half obfuscations. Putin recently compared himself to Peter the Great
who fought the Great Northern Wars from 1700 to 1721. Addressing young
scientists and entrepreneurs, Putin "talked politics and power." He
spoke about the new battle for geopolitical dominance and proclaimed
Peter the Great to be a role model who in Putin's eyes reclaimed Russian
land. For Putin, it is all about land. Russia wants the Donbas, period.
And maybe some more.

#### Offensive realism is wrong and can't explain Russia's actions in Ukraine -- 3 warrants 

**Davenport 22** John J. Davenport (John J. Davenport teaches political
philosophy, including just war theory, human rights, global governance,
democratic theory, and related topics at Fordham University in New York
City), 7-5-2022, \"Shared blame for Russia\'s war on Ukraine is not
realism --- it\'s irrational,\" National Catholic Reporter,
https://www.ncronline.org/news/opinion/shared-blame-russias-war-ukraine-not-realism-its-irrational

But the controversy surrounding Francis\' remark derives from its
resonance with the political scientist John Mearsheimer\'s \"offensive
realism\" theory that \"great powers\" will generally do whatever is
necessary to dominate their region of the globe as a means to their own
national security --- whatever they pretend to believe about the human
rights of civilians and codes of international law, which have banned
annexation of territory by force for over a century. [In his infamous
New Yorker interview, and in a lecture widely circulated online,
Mearsheimer blamed NATO nations for provoking Putin\'s war on Ukraine by
ignoring Putin\'s view that for Ukraine to become \"pro-America liberal
democracy\" would be an \"existential threat\" to Russia.]{.underline}
Despite its shocking incompatibility with the \"rules-based
international order\" established by 150 years of treaties rooted in
just war theory and natural law, Mearsheimer\'s view is popular because
it claims to be brutally honest about \"harder, darker constraints of an
anarchic world,\" which follow from a few postulates about sovereign
states and their leaders\' motives. [**But in fact, the spell it casts
on thinking about foreign policy is deeply misleading** for three main
reasons, ranging from more to less obvious. **First, offensive realism
is not merely an empirical or predictive device**]{.underline}, as its
defenders sometimes like to claim: It tells leading nations like the
United States to allow other powerful states a limited \"sphere\" in
which they act as hegemons, but also to \"counterbalance\" them when,
like China today, they threaten interests beyond their own immediate
region. This is an imperialist standpoint typical of 19th-century
thinking, as Mearsheimer readily admits: [It tolerates, and thus
encourages, the poisonous notion that a nation\'s great power permits it
to turn otherwise-independent states around it into mere proxies and use
their peoples as \"buffers\" against conceivable foreign
attacks.]{.underline} For example, in 2016, Mearsheimer and coauthor
Stephen Walt wrote in Foreign Affairs that [what \"really matters\" most
for the United States is to preserve \"U.S. dominance in the Western
Hemisphere\" while weakening other potential hegemons. They recommended
leaving Syria to Putin, despite the Russian forces targeting thousands
of civilian buildings and hundreds of hospitals during its air campaign
in Syria.]{.underline} ADVERTISEMENT This view, which once countenanced
American attempts to control regimes in Latin America, has been rejected
by popes at least since Populorum Progressio in 1967, and by the U.S.
government since the late 1980s. As Adam Tooze explains, offensive
realism traces back to the Nazi lawyer Carl Schmitt\'s belief in \"a
world order based on dividing the planet into large spatial blocs, each
dominated by a major power.\" The moral idea that legitimate sovereignty
depends on protecting human rights, or the common good more broadly
understood, which underwrote the U.N.\'s \"responsibility to protect\"
doctrine, has no place in this framework. **[Second, while Mearsheimer
has been lauded for \"predicting\" the war in Ukraine, he got Putin\'s
motives mostly wrong]{.underline}**. **[Putin knows that NATO is a
defensive alliance that has no plans or desire whatsoever to invade
Russia.]{.underline}** Kremlin experts understood that NATO admitted
Eastern European nations only to secure them against any return to the
horrors they suffered under the totalitarian fist of the Soviet Union
--- fears that have now been fully justified. Two decades ago, [Putin
even wanted Russia itself to join NATO]{.underline}; this [tragically
wasted opportunity runs contrary to offensive realism
theor]{.underline}y. Instead, as Robert Person and Michael McFaul argue,
what Putin feared was never NATO expansion but rather the spread of
democratic values. Kremlin complaints about NATO were correlated with
upsurges of democratic reform movements within Russia inspired by the
Arab Spring in 2011 and later by Ukrainians ousting Putin\'s puppet
ruler in Kyiv. In sum, [Putin sees that the main threat to his
kleptocratic dictatorship is not NATO forces within his geographic
region, but rather ideals of democratic self-governance and global
standards that clamp down on corrupti]{.underline}on. Add to this, as
Ross Douthat notes, following Anne Applebaum, Putin\'s \"very personal
desire to restore a mystical vision of a greater Russia.\" More
generally, as Applebaum and Garry Kasparov argue, the dictators in
Russia, China, North Korea, Belarus, Iran and Nicaragua \"understand
that the language of democracy, anti-corruption, and justice is
dangerous to their form of autocratic power.\" [Offensive realism theory
massively understates the influence of such big ideas that move hearts
and minds]{.underline}. It would have us believe that governments should
focus only on material wealth and physical protection of territory.
Political leaders\' motives in foreign relations are more complex than
this naive deterministic picture implies. [For example, Chinese leaders
fear uncensored Hollywood movies as much as they fear insecure supply
chains for food and raw materials, which they are shoring up through
increasing their influence in Africa.]{.underline} Their terror that
\"Western\" ideals --- they mean individual autonomy and independent
thought --- will harm Chinese \"interests\" has more in common with
Taliban religious dogma than with military or economic strategy. This
ambiguity about \"national interests\" explains why offensive realism
theory offers no clear criteria to delimit a great power\'s \"natural\"
sphere within which we should recognize its suzerainty. For example, are
small islands near the Philippines in China\'s putative sphere, despite
an international tribunal\'s ruling against Beijing\'s claim?
[Similarly, in 2014, one could have invoked Mearsheimer\'s own
power-balancing rationale to argue for admitting Ukraine into NATO as a
way to \"contain\" Russia\'s rising power not only in Belarus but also
in Syria, Iran, Libya and Mali, which are far from any romanticized
ancient Slavic empire. **Third, the strategic axioms on which offensive
realism is based only remain plausible while not enough world leaders
believe in a rules-based order founded on the common goods of
humanity.**]{.underline} Thus, [offensive realism helps foster and
maintain the very attitudes of distrust and expectations of success
through conquest that force peoples who only want peace and prosperity
instead to adopt a war footing.]{.underline} In other words,
**o[ffensive realism\'s attraction is like]{.underline}** [the
proverbial emperor\'s new clothes: It is a partly **self-fulfilling
prophecy** that would predict little in a world where a global alliance
of even moderately just republics established trust in minimum
thresholds of decency for all governments.]{.underline}

#### The aff doesn't expand NATO but even if it did there would be no long-term damage to the US/Russia relationship

451--470, https://doi.org/10.1057/s41311-020-00234-8

[**Meaningful cooperation remained possible with NATO
enlargemen**t]{.underline}. Indeed[, NATO and Russia collaborated
extensively in Afghanistan, and the United States attempted to cultivate
closer ties with Russia after Barack Obama won the presi-dency in
2008]{.underline}. [Contrary to Mearsheimer's fatalistic predictions
about nuclear reduc-tions]{.underline}, the '[reset' by the Obama
administration even involved both countries signing and ratifying the
New START Treaty]{.underline}, an arms control agreement that cut 30% of
their strategic nuclear arsenals and capped them at deployed weapons
each. Rus-sia did violate the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, which
eliminated land-based cruise missiles and launchers of ranges from 500
to 5500 miles, [but it has previously complained of the constraints
imposed by that treaty for reasons relating to China, not
NATO]{.underline} (Gates 2014, 154).Tensions did erupt between the USA
and Russia, but the causal impact of NATO enlargement is probably much
less than what the conventional wisdom suggests. Some, like Kathryn
Stoner and Michael McFaul, argue that domestic political and economic
developments drove Russia to be more confrontational toward the United
States. Putin justiﬁed political repression at home with reference to
the threat alleg-edly posed by the USA (2015, 169, 178).[The argument
that NATO enlargement has provoked Russian aggression against its
neighbors is likely wrong. In one study of Russian leaders' foreign
policy rhetoric from 2000 to 2016, Maria Snegovaya (2020) ﬁnds that
Russian leaders articulate anti-Western statements most when oil prices
are high, suggesting that---like other petrostates---they are emboldened
to press their claims against their neighbors under these circumstances.
She uncovers little evidence that NATO enlargement drives anti-Western
rhetoric. Another study ﬁnds that Russian diplomats consistently adopt a
competitive posture vis-à-vis other envoys in various international
organizations (Schmitt 2019). NATO enlargement does appear to have
played a role in the lead-up]{.underline} [to the Russo-Georgian War of
200]{.underline}8, though the alliance rejected giving a Member-ship
Action Plan to Georgia partly because of worries about being dragged
into a conﬂict with Russia. Territorial disputes and strong
personalities made that bilat-eral relationship ripe for conﬂict
(Lanoszka 2018). NATO also rejected Ukraine's application for a
Membership Action Plan in 2008. Similarly, [NATO played a much lesser
role in stoking tensions with Russia than some accounts suggest because
it posed at most a very limited threat to Russia]{.underline}.
Operationally, national caveats sty-mied NATO's International Security
Assistance Force in Afghanistan while a large majority of its members
spent far less than 2% of their gross domestic products on defense
(Saideman and Auerswald 2012; Stanley-Lockman and Wolf 2016). The US and
NATO military presence east of Germany was (and remains) threadbare,
con-sisting mostly of elements making up a missile defense system that
even Russian observers like Alexei Arbatov (2016, 168) acknowledge would
not undermine strate-gic stability. During much of the Obama
administration, the USA was withdrawing military forces from Europe so
as to concentrate more fully on East Asia (Simón 2015). Crucially, NATO
enlargement was a non-issue when the Maidan movement began in Kyiv in
late 2013. At stake was Ukraine's signature of the Ukraine--Euro-pean
Union Association Agreement, which was similar to what long-time
Rus-sian protégé Serbia had negotiated earlier that same year. This
agreement did not even guarantee that Ukraine would be a European Union
member, but would have spurred closer economic and political ties. NATO
membership remainder at best a distant prospect.

### NATO Bad -- Russia 

#### Increasing NATO's capabilities creates a self-fulfilling prophecy that makes Russia more likely to lashout 

**Achar 22** Gilbert Achcar (Gilbert Achcar is a professor at SOAS,
University of London. His new book, The New Cold War: The United States,
Russia and China from Kosovo to Ukraine, will come out in early 2023.) ,

https://www.thenation.com/article/world/nato-china-russia-us/

Supporters of NATO's eastward expansion wanted the US empire to
encompass a large chunk of the former Soviet empire in the belief that,
sooner or later, post-communist Russia would seek to revive its long
imperial tradition. It was therefore necessary to preempt this
inevitable development by securing US control of as much of the former
Soviet empire as possible. Since Putin's regime has indeed engaged in
predatory behavior since 2008 in what has traditionally been regarded by
Russia as its imperial "near abroad"---intervention in Georgia in 2008,
annexation of Crimea and intervention in Donbas in 2014, attempted
invasion for "regime change" in Ukraine in 2022, and ongoing efforts to
occupy the whole of Donbas and adjacent areas---[one would be tempted to
believe that those who advocated NATO's enlargement have been proven
right.]{.underline} [The truth is, however, that this outcome is
precisely what those who opposed the enlargement had cautioned against.
They rightly predicted that the Russians would see NATO's eastward
expansion as a hostile gesture and that it would therefore breed
revanchist attitudes among them. In other words, they warned that
enlarging NATO in preemption of Russia's return to imperial behavior
would actually act as a **self-fulfilling prophecy**.]{.underline} The
1997 summit officially invited Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic
to join the alliance. The three Eastern European countries' accession
was completed two years later at the Washington summit that celebrated
NATO's 50th anniversary. It happened at a time when the alliance was
bombing Yugoslavia in contravention of international law, in the first
post-1990 US-led war not authorized by the United Nations Security
Council. [Along with the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that
circumvented yet again the UNSC, and NATO's subsequent enlargement in
2004 to seven more East European countries, including the three Baltic
states, which were formerly part of the USSR, this sequence of events
was decisive in creating the animosity between Russia and the West that
was a prelude to the invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline} The forthcoming
summit in Madrid will be the occasion of a major qualitative leap in the
definition of NATO's raison d'être, no less consequential than the 1997
summit. This is not an allusion to the formal invitation of Finland and
Sweden to join the alliance, although this development is certainly very
significant, more so perhaps than all previous rounds of enlargement,
because it will considerably lengthen NATO's direct border with Russia
(Finland's border with Russia is 1,340 kilometers long). On this issue,
the only question mark is Turkey's position, since any new membership
offer must be unanimously approved by all existing NATO members, a
principle that grants each one of them an actual veto right. Ankara
wants the two Nordic states to take measures against the Kurdish
movement, strongly represented among refugees in both countries. But the
most dangerous novelty at the Madrid summit [consists of a major
qualitative extension of NATO's purpose.]{.underline} Originally founded
as a defensive alliance against the Soviet Union and its subordinate
states, NATO has mutated after 1991 into a "security
organization"---meaning that it has been involved in military actions
(NATO as such did not formally engage in any war in the USSR's
days)---and redefined its purpose in ostracizing post-Soviet Russia by
expanding toward its borders. The NATO-Russia Council created in 1997
was a meager consolation given to Moscow in lieu of inviting it to join
the alliance. Nobody was fooled. [From tacit, NATO's hostility to Russia
became explicit after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.]{.underline} The
forthcoming [Madrid summit is going to directly involve NATO in open
hostility to China, far beyond the alliance's original area of
relevance]{.underline}. This area is defined in the 1949 treaty
constitutive of NATO as comprising "the territory of any of the Parties
in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of France, on
the territory of or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of any of the
Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer."
NATO's post-1991 mutation led it to intervene beyond its members'
territory---first in the Balkans, then much further from its original
area, in Afghanistan, in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks.
Participation in the organization's meetings has nevertheless remained
restricted to Europe and North America. No longer. Japan, along with
Australia, New Zealand and South Korea have been invited to attend the
Madrid summit [as NATO "partners" in the Asia-Pacific region---a very
**serious provocation to Beijing**.]{.underline} It can only interpret
this invitation as a step toward the consolidation of US-led alliances
in a single global network opposed to both Russia and China. After the
preliminary meeting of NATO's defense ministers held on June 16, the
organization's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, declared that the
new NATO Strategic Concept that will be adopted at the Madrid summit
will set out the alliance's position "on Russia, on emerging challenges,
and for the first time, on China." From the perspective of Washington's
drive to perpetuate its hegemony over most of Europe and the Asia
Pacific by portraying Russia and China as enemies---a grand strategy
that has been followed by all successive post-1991 US
administrations---the new escalation to be confirmed in Madrid makes
full sense. While resolutely supporting Ukraine's resistance to the
Russian invasion, President Biden has multiplied provocative gestures
toward Beijing, including his statement, prior to a summit meeting in
May of the anti-China alliance known as the Quad (Japan, Australia, and
India along with the United States), that the United States would defend
Taiwan militarily. The statement was quickly watered down by the State
Department, which had in May removed from a Taiwan Fact Sheet on its
website the statement "we do not support Taiwan independence" and
reinstated it in June. From the perspective of Europe and the Asia
Pacific, acquiescing to this de facto extension of NATO's role is
equivalent to being herded like Panurge's sheep toward throwing
themselves into the sea. Antagonizing China is not in Europe's interest,
nor is it in the interest of any of the states invited to the Madrid
summit. Even if the European governments believed that Russia has now
irreversibly become a threat to their security, it would be utterly
counterproductive for them to push Beijing toward consolidating an
alliance with Moscow. [These developments bring the world closer to a
conflagration that could dwarf the ongoing war in Ukraine and endanger
the future of humankind. It is urgent to rebuild a global peace movement
opposed to all military alliances, demanding their dissolution, a
movement opposed as well to the ongoing massive increases in military
budgets. It is high time to return to global disarmament under the aegis
of the UN, as foreseen in the UN Charter]{.underline}. This charter is
the cornerstone of international law whose role must be renewed against
the ongoing drift toward the law of the jungle. The huge and
ever-growing amounts that are spent on armament and destruction would be
wisely reallocated to the only wars that are truly in humanity's
interest: the wars against poverty and climate change.

#### Russia is reactionary -- they wouldn't have invaded Ukraine if NATO had not provoked them 

**Maguire 22** MAIREAD MAGUIRE (peace activist from Northern Ireland,
Nobel Peace Prize recipient), July 7, 2022, \"Nato expansion has been
main cause of Ukraine military conflict,\", Irish News,

Patrick Murphy's column --'Pope's comments may help avert global
conflict' (June 18) -- are courageous and challenging. Courageous in
that Ireland (and most of Europe) are caught up in Russia-phobia and war
propaganda being peddled by our mainstream media and military industrial
complex. Mr Murphy quoted Pope Francis as saying that the war was
"perhaps somehow either provoked or not prevented". I think this
statement hints towards the elephant in the room (Nato/US endless
expansion). The US Peace Council of May 12 describes the Ukraine as a
US-manufactured conflict and says "[Russia's military intervention in
Ukraine could have been avoided if the US had not relentlessly provoked
it".]{.underline} [Nato -- the US-dominated global war machine -- whose
policy is 'full dominance spectrum']{.underline} contrary to its claims
it is not a defensive organisation. Its [purpose has been to act as an
instrument for US world domination and to prevent all challenges to US
hegemony]{.underline}. It [should have been disbanded in l99l after the
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, but instead expanded into 15 new
countries and breaking its promise to President Gorbachev]{.underline},
that it would not expand east. This relentless eastward [expansion of
Nato during the past decade has been an existential threat to a
nuclear-armed Russia and the main cause of the present military conflict
in Ukraine.]{.underline} Russia's military intervention into Ukraine
should never have happened and the suffering inflicted upon the
Ukrainian people (and Russian) has been horrific and it is right all
those who have suffered so much should be helped. However, [sending arms
into Ukraine only adds fuel to the fire.]{.underline} There are vested
interests from western powers hard at work, and much money to be made.
As it stands the west is bankrolling the war with arms and billions in
dollars/euros, for their own agenda. These people will not shed a tear
for the young dead of Ukraine. Their aim is for a weakened Russia
(through sanctions), more military spending and a more divided and
economically weak Europe, and as long as we continue not to question
their role in Ukraine, they will succeed. There seems to be only one
winner in this, and they are not in Europe. Now is the time for dialogue
and those western political leaders who stoke the fire of fear, division
and hate in Ukraine, instead of calling for ceasefire and negotiation,
must consider the misery brought upon the poor people that most live
with the horrors of war.

#### Expanding NATO through security cooperation does not solve. It only provides the US with more avenues to create conflicts that support their own interests -- causes Russian backlash and strengthens the Sino-Russo alliance

[In a moot effort to cling to its hegemony and keep NATO relevant,
Washington has, in turn, allowed the invasion to happen.]{.underline}
Following a long period of escalation, [Russian President Vladimir Putin
has ordered troops into Eastern Ukraine's two breakaway
regio]{.underline}ns, prompting immediate Western condemnation and an
emergency UN Security Council meeting. While Moscow stands accused by
the West of increasing acts of aggression on the Ukrainian border,
[**the invasion was not a one-sided event.** For months, the
Anglo-American bloc has been unwilling to de-escalate the
crisis]{.underline}. [Washington and London have aimed to resuscitate
the case for the NATO alliance, to invalidate arguments for a separate
European Union-wide security arrangement, and to weaken Russia in
seeking to prevent the emergence of rival blocs in Eurasia and the
Asia-Pacific regions.]{.underline} However, to put it bluntly, [this
strategy will not reverse the decline of American hegemony.]{.underline}
Is the 'transatlantic alliance' back? A couple of days before the
invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr [Zelenskyy expressed his
disappointment at the failure of his Western "friends" to support
Ukraine vis-a-vis Russian aggression]{.underline}. This [perception is
consistent with Ukrainian officials' previous accusation that **US
President Joe Biden gave Moscow a "green light" to
invade.**]{.underline} Kiev's disappointment is completely
understandable. [Giving Moscow the green light is as much about
transatlantic relations as it is about West-Russia or Ukraine-Russia
relations. The US' post-World War II hegemony is predicated on its
domination in continental Europe, with **NATO acting as the principal
mechanism for achieving American primacy.**]{.underline} The
Anglo-American strategy now focuses on preventing European states from
acting independently. The Russian threat is thought to serve that aim,
pushing Europe to be in need of American and British power. The
Anglo-American bloc has never been happy with France's attempts to
establish an alternative European security mechanism, or with Germany's
relations with Russia -- especially in terms of cooperation on the Nord
Stream gas pipeline. The growing economic ties between the European
Union and China are also causes of concern for the Anglo-American
alliance. In this context, [it is not surprising Biden pointed out at
the 2021 Virtual Munich Security Conference: "America is back. The
transatlantic alliance is back]{.underline}...The partnership between
Europe and the United States, in my view, is and must remain the
cornerstone of all that we hope to accomplish in the 21st Century, just
as we did in the 20th Century." Eliminating Russia in the 'Great Game'?
[Neither NATO nor Western states will go to war with Russia over the
invasion of Ukraine. The invasion justifies their efforts to undermine
Russia economically and politically.]{.underline} However, [the strategy
of weakening Russia is not only about its military activities in Eastern
Europe.]{.underline} The [Kremlin has long embraced an approach that
emphasises Russia's great power status in a multipolar world, in direct
opposition to the US' vision of a unipolar world]{.underline} in which
it reigns supreme. [Therefore, the Anglo-American goal is not only to
weaken Russia via economic sanctions, or harm Moscow's economic
interests in Europe, but also to divert its attention and energy away
from the Indo and Asia-Pacific in particular]{.underline}, with the aim
of hindering Russia's partnerships with India and China. India has
decades-long ties with Russia, and New Delhi recently started receiving
Russian S-400 defence systems. But India is also a member of Quad -- an
alliance involving the US, Japan, and Australia, which aims to counter
China's growing assertiveness. Both the US and Britain have long been
pushing India to cooperate with them in dealing with China. At the last
Quad meeting, the US requested that India stand by its side in the face
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Another important topic for
discussion was the growing economic and diplomatic relationships between
Russia and China. The Anglo-American bloc hopes that the Ukraine
invasion will severely wound Russia, preventing it from being an
important rival actor in their confrontation with China. The question of
American decline Anglo-American domination will push Europe into
submission to some extent, and Russia will be wounded. But will this
reverse the unravelling of American hegemony in the long term? As
Russian President Vladimir Putin made clear in his televised speech just
before the invasion, sanctions imposed by the West will not dissuade
Russia from attempting to preserve its standing on the world stage.
[NATO has already lost prestige and power, and the invasion of Ukraine
will only worsen this situation.]{.underline} Increasing the
Anglo-American bloc's weight in Europe due to the conflict in Eastern
Europe will also have a negative impact on their ability to contain
China in Asia. As it follows Russia's annexation of Crimea, Russia's
invasion of Ukraine will not cause France to abandon its call for
strategic autonomy for the EU entirely, nor will it change the
interdependence of Europe and Russia on gas. The Anglo-American
coalition's gas diversification efforts in favour of Europe will affect
the strategic dynamics in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Yet it
is not likely to obstruct the Nord Stream 2 project, despite Washington
wanting to see this. Due to the steady erosion of the US' hegemonic
position in the world economy, it appears that China will continue to be
the EU's biggest trading partner. India has already signalled that it
will remain neutral on the Ukraine crisis, which implies that Russia's
invasion of Ukraine will have little impact on the close ties between
Moscow and New Delhi. More crucially, **[this situation appears to have
given Moscow and Beijing further reasons to act together and get
closer]{.underline}**, despite their conflicting interests in Asia.
[They share a common desire to challenge the Western-dominated
international system. Should Russia be wounded by Western sanctions,
**it will rely on China in economic terms to some extent, while their
collective security actions will hasten the demise of US
hegemony.**]{.underline} In the case of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
there is no absolute winner. Indeed, nothing will change in terms of the
ongoing and gradual unravelling of global American hegemony

#### Strengthening NATO incentivized Russia to invade Ukraine. The plan overextends NATO by committing even further to it which increases tensions

obsession plays into the Ukraine crisis,\" Vox,
https://www.vox.com/22900113/nato-ukraine-russia-crisis-clinton-expansion

When tens of thousands of Russian troops started moving toward the
Ukrainian border late last year, Russian President Vladimir [Putin
effectively issued an ultimatum: They won't go home until he had
"concrete agreements prohibiting any further eastward expansion of
NATO."]{.underline} This week, as the US and Russia exchange formal
diplomatic letters, Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized that
"[NATO's door is open, remains open, and that is our
commitment."]{.underline} But [few have been asking why the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would want to move east in the first
place]{.underline}. What was once a Cold War security pact has become a
21st-century organization with global military commitments and ever more
member countries from Eastern Europe. Members of the alliance didn't
always foresee its expansion and, three decades ago, some of America's
most renowned foreign policy thinkers argued that [NATO should be
nowhere near Ukraine.]{.underline} Ukraine is a former Soviet republic.
It isn't joining NATO anytime soon, and President Joe Biden has said as
much. Still, [NATO's open-door policy --- the alliance's foundational
principle that any qualified European country could join --- cuts both
ways. To the West, it's a statement of autonomy; to Russia, it's a
threat]{.underline}. The core of the NATO treaty is Article 5, a
commitment that an attack on any country is treated as an attack on the
entire alliance --- [meaning any Russian military engagement with a
hypothetical NATO-member Ukraine would theoretically bring Moscow into
conflict with]{.underline} the US, the UK, France, and the 27 other
[NATO]{.underline} members. The prospect of Ukraine and Georgia joining
NATO has antagonized Putin at least since President George W. Bush
expressed support for the idea in 2008. "That was a real mistake," said
Steven Pifer, who from 1998 to 2000 was ambassador to Ukraine under
President Bill Clinton. "It drove the Russians nuts. It created
expectations in Ukraine and Georgia, which then were never met. And so
that just made that whole issue of enlargement a complicated one." No
country can join the alliance without the unanimous buy-in of all 30
member countries, and many have opposed Ukraine's membership, in part
because it doesn't meet the conditions to join. All of this has put
Ukraine in an untenable position: an applicant for an alliance that
wasn't going to accept it, while irritating a potential opponent next
door, without having any degree of NATO protection. [Revisiting NATO's
own history is not to justify Putin's revanchism and threats to
democracy. It is certainly true that he is a repressive leader who has
annexed neighbors and funded separatists, cracked down on activists and
allegedly poisoned enemies. Some experts say that his criticism of NATO
expansion is a mere pretext. Still, the stakes of NATO's presence on
Russia's borders and potential expansion are high, and at least in
today's Washington, few question that presence.]{.underline} "The
open-door policy is the one that [maximizes friction with
Russia]{.underline}, which has **[culminated in the crisis we have
now,]{.underline}**" said Mary Sarotte, a historian of international
relations at Johns Hopkins University. "I don't think Vladimir Putin is
primarily interested in historical accuracy, but I believe **[he is
genuinely aggrieved at the way the post--Cold War order includes no
stake for Russia."]{.underline}** So how did it become an article of
faith in Washington that NATO would expand in its membership and its
purpose? Debating NATO's future in the '90s As the Soviet Union cracked
up, it wasn't certain that NATO would stick around either. "During the
Cold War, NATO had a mission that was clear and tight, and could be put
on a bumper sticker," said Rajan Menon of the research group Defense
Priorities. The alliance existed, he explained, "to deter and defeat the
Warsaw pact," the countries aligned with collapsing Soviet Russia. Its
mission was in doubt after the Cold War --- so much so that the
president of the dissolving Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, even asked
about his country joining NATO. Even the shape of the US role in Europe
was uncertain. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the American public
was more concerned about domestic policy. Bill Clinton had been elected
with a campaign slogan of "It's the Economy, Stupid," and without
experience as a statesman, he seemed likely to restrain America's global
ambitions. President Bill Clinton stands in front of his limo in
Moscow's Red Square, in January 1994. Diana Walker/Getty Images As
Clinton became a frequent traveler to Russia and quickly plunged into
statecraft, the promotion of democracy in Europe emerged as a primary US
foreign policy goal. But it wasn't clear that a military alliance like
NATO would be the best way to advance that. A debate over NATO's merits
erupted in Washington in the '90s. George Kennan, the eminent architect
of the Soviet "containment" strategy and a former ambassador to the
Soviet Union, wrote in 1997 that expanding NATO would be a "fateful
error" because it would "inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and
militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion." Kennan was far from alone
in his criticism, as journalist Peter Beinart noted this week: Thomas
Friedman, America's most prominent foreign policy columnist, declared it
the "most ill-conceived project of the post-Cold War era." Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, widely considered the most erudite member of the US
Senate, warned, "We have no idea what we're getting into." Meanwhile,
military leaders saw enlargement as detrimental to US interests, the
Congressional Budget Office saw it as too expensive, and, later,
intelligence agencies outright opposed adding Ukraine and Georgia.
Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Perry wrote in his memoir that he
nearly resigned over enlargement. The nascent European Union might have
been the channel to consolidate democratic development in post-Soviet
countries. Or Europe could have been engaged through the multinational
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or even through a
focus on closer relationships with individual countries. But Washington
chose NATO. In the early '90s, that generation of national security
operatives weren't prepared to forfeit leverage in Europe. "NATO had to
find something to do or go out of business, and these people who grew up
all their lives alongside it would not let it go out of business," said
Barry Posen, a political scientist at MIT. Jenonne Walker, who served in
the Clinton White House, said she was among the minority who would have
preferred the European Union as the mechanism for US engagement. "Almost
everyone in the establishment wanted it to be through NATO, because that
was where our influence was deemed to be greatest," she said. Clinton
first floated a program that would be a gateway to NATO membership,
called the Partnership for Peace, but that was ultimately dropped. By
1994, NATO said it "would welcome NATO enlargement that would reach to
democratic states to our East," and Poland, the Czech Republic, and
Hungry would be the first to join. Electoral politics of the moment also
reinforced Clinton's decision to back NATO expansion. Republicans had
won on that platform in the '94 midterms. Ahead of the 1996 presidential
election, "the domestic side of the White House" believed that growing
the alliance would "play good with Polish American, Baltic American,
Hungarian American communities," explained Pifer. President Clinton, his
national security adviser Tony Lake, and Secretary of State Warren
Christopher were optimistic that NATO could branch out, with the
possibility of a constructive relationship between NATO and Russia. As
that trifecta supported adding member states, the NATO alliance became
an organizing principle of US foreign policy going forward. Putin's war
on Ukraine, explained NATO enlargement reoriented America in the world
Initially, it took much political maneuvering for the newly united
Germany to join NATO. The alliance added more eastern bloc counties in
the late '90s and early 2000s. The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania on the northern end of Russia's western border joined NATO
in 2005 without much fuss from Russia. As it grew, [NATO became a
vehicle to address new global issues that worried US
leaders.]{.underline} "Enlarging NATO becomes the gift that keeps on
giving," said Joshua Shifrinson, an international relations scholar at
Boston University. "It was a way of incentivizing liberalization in
countries that had been in the Communist bloc, [showing that the US
still has a mission in Europe, and a way of the US projecting power and
checking alternative systems like the European Union."]{.underline}
During the Cold War, [NATO never engaged in military
operations.]{.underline} But amid the Yugoslav conflict and Kosovo war
of the '90s, the alliance enforced a no-fly zone, then deployed a
peacekeeping force, and in 1999 dropped hundreds of bombs on Yugoslavia.
The whole process was delayed and disorganized, according to diplomats,
and exposed NATO's inadequacies in dealing with a hot war. That pushed
Clinton to embrace NATO further. "Our inaction was making NATO look weak
and irrelevant," said Walker, who went on to serve as ambassador to the
Czech Republic from 1995 to 1998. "And the line in the halls of power in
Washington was, 'We have to enlarge NATO to save it, to make it look as
though it were dynamic and on the move and not stagnant.'" [By taking on
new military roles, the institution created new imperatives for
itself.]{.underline} In the 2000s, NATO went to the front lines:
fighting in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks and training
Afghan forces starting in 2003, countering piracy in waters near
Somalia, and then in a military intervention that was meant to protect
civilians in Libya and went much further than its United
Nations--approved mandate in toppling the tyrant Muammar Qaddafi. [Now,
America's foreign policy establishment is dominated by people who are
even more committed to the alliance's power]{.underline} than those who
saved it in the 1990s. NATO's existence and enlargement is a baseline
assumption. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ukraine aspire to join.
[That has consequences.]{.underline} James Dobbins, who served as a
senior diplomat in Europe during the '90s and 2000s, says [that a
commitment to NATO expansion has limited Biden's options]{.underline}.
"It's particularly out of tune --- [the idea that the United States
should expand its defense perimeter to a half-dozen countries in Europe,
when we should be shifting our focus on China]{.underline}," Dobbins
said. At its core, this is about US power and how it has changed since
the Soviet Union's end. "It's become a conversation about whether the US
should be out in the world defending human rights and spreading
democracy," said Emma Ashford of the Atlantic Council. "[Is the US out
in the world to protect its own security or to be a crusading force for
good?" The Biden administration will now have to find its own
answer.]{.underline}

https://www.cato.org/commentary/nato-pushing-russia-towards-retaliation

**[The United States and its NATO allies continue to find ways to
antagonize Russia.]{.underline}** [The latest provocation is a request
from Norway to more than double the number of U.S. troops stationed on
its territory and deploy them even closer to the border with
Russia.]{.underline} Granted, the numbers involved are not large. There
are currently 330 American military personnel in the country on a
"rotational" basis. Oslo's new request would increase the number to
seven hundred. If the Norwegian government gets its way, the new troops
would be stationed in the far north, barely 260 miles from Russia, in
contrast to the existing unit in central Norway[, several hundred miles
from Russian territory.]{.underline} The rotational aspect theoretically
complies with Norway's pledge to Moscow in 1949 when it joined NATO that
Oslo would not allow U.S. bases on its territory. Indeed, Foreign
Minister Ine Marie Eriksen Soriede reiterated that assurance in
connection with the new troop request, contending that there would be
"no American bases on Norwegian soil." Making their official status
rotational supposedly means that the troops are there only on a
temporary basis. It is a cynical dodge that fools no one---least of all
Vladimir Putin and his colleagues in the Kremlin. Norwegian officials
also insisted that the new deployment was not directed against Russia.
That assurance has even less credibility than the rotational rationale.
[Oslo's request came just days after nine nations along NATO's eastern
flank, including Poland, the Baltic republics, and Romania called for a
larger Alliance (meaning largely U.S.) **military presence in their
region**]{.underline}**.** In addition to the move to increase the
number of U.S. troops in Norway, **[major NATO military exercises (war
games)]{.underline}**, code‐​named Trident Juncture 18, [are
scheduled]{.underline} for October. The focus of those exercises will be
central and northern Norway, and they will involve thirty‐​five thousand
troops, seventy ships, and 130 aircraft. Nevertheless, [Soriede insisted
that she couldn't see "any serious reason why Russia should
react"]{.underline} to Oslo's proposal for an enhanced U.S. military
presence. [She should perhaps receive credit for being able to make such
a statement with a straight face. But such transparent **dishonesty is a
longstanding feature of NATO's behavior toward Moscow.**]{.underline}
Even during the Cold War, Western officials routinely insisted that the
Alliance was not directed against the Soviet Union. In their more candid
moments, though, they conceded the obvious---that NATO was a military
mechanism to contain Soviet power. Granted, it was not the sole purpose.
Lord Hastings Ismay, NATO's first secretary general, stated that NATO
was created to "keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the
Germans down." The first objective, though, seemed to be the most
important. Containment of the Soviet Union made sense to keep democratic
Europe out of Moscow's geopolitical orbit, and NATO was an important
component of that strategy. But [Western leaders continued to apply that
model to a noncommunist Russia once the Cold War ended. Indeed, they
intensified the containment rationale by adding new members throughout
Eastern Europe and expanding the Alliance to Russia's
border.]{.underline} Those actions were taken despite verbal assurances
from Secretary of State James Baker and West German foreign minister
Hans‐​Dietrich Genscher at the time of German reunification that NATO
would not expand beyond Germany's eastern border. Throughout the
Alliance's inexorable move eastward, Western officials and pundits
insisted that NATO enlargement was not directed against Russia. Indeed,
some members of the Western foreign‐​policy community argued that the
move would benefit Russia by erasing Cold War dividing lines and
increasing Eastern Europe's political and economic stability. One
wonders whether Westerners thought that the Russians were gullible
enough to believe such absurd arguments, or the proponents actually
believed their own propaganda. [NATO leaders continue to insist that the
Alliance has no offensive intent against Russia or that the Alliance
seeks to undermine Moscow's interests. **But NATO's behavior belies such
assurances**. The interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo that weakened and
eventually truncated Serbia, a longstanding Russian ally, was certainly
not a friendly act. Stationing Alliance (most notably U.S.) forces and
weapons systems in NATO's easternmost members, (a process that has
accelerated markedly since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014)
likewise is provocative.]{.underline} Yet Western leaders and publics
act as through Russia has no legitimate reason to react negatively to
such moves, as Soriede stated explicitly regarding the proposed increase
in the U.S. troop presence in her country. NATO has conducted several
large‐​scale military exercises in Poland and other member states, as
well as naval maneuvers in the Black Sea near Russia's important naval
base at Sevastopol. Again, the Russians apparently are wrong to regard
such actions as provocative and threatening. [U.S. and NATO leaders need
to adopt a much more realistic attitude. **Any nation would regard
NATO's behavior as decidedly unfriendly, and even menacing, if conducted
on its frontiers.**]{.underline} Continuing such actions while cynically
denying their hostile intent could easily lead to miscalculation and a
catastrophic confrontation. As a first step toward mending ties with
Moscow, the Trump administration should summarily reject Norway's
unnecessary request for more U.S. troops.

endorses such a strategy]{.underline}", and "makes no bones about who it
is aimed at". The NDS was authored by then-Secretary of Defense James
Mattis in 2018, under former president Donald Trump's administration and
sets out "a clear road map ... to meet the challenges posed by a
re-emergence of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia,"
wrote Glazebrook. It identifies "interstate strategic competition"
rather than "terrorism" as "the primary concern in US national security"
today. According to Glazebrook, "the NDS vows that 'with our allies and
partners, we will challenge competitors by maneuvering them into
unfavorable positions, frustrating their efforts, precluding their
options while expanding our own, and forcing them to confront conflict
under adverse conditions'. "There it is, in black and white: it is
official US policy to bait Russia into conflict," he wrote. [Mearsheimer
noted in a 2015 lecture that "If you really want to wreck Russia, what
you really want to do is encourage Russia to conquer Ukraine". "The US
and the UK -- the latter in particular -- appear to have been taking
this advice very seriously," wrote Glazebrook. **US meddling in
Afghanistan**]{.underline} Referring to the Soviet Invasion of
Afghanistan in December 1979, Glazebrook wrote: "Until 1998, the
mainstream view of US support for the anti-communist insurgency in
Afghanistan throughout the 1980s was that it had been a response to the
Russian invasion of December 1979. But, as Glazebrook reminds us, "in an
interview in 1998, Zbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Advisor to US
President Jimmy Carter, admitted that the truth was the exact opposite".
Brzezinski told Le Nouvel Observateur that Carter had signed "the first
directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in
Kabul" four months earlier. [Brzezinski wrote to Carter at the time to
express that "this aid was going to induce a Soviet military
intervention"]{.underline}. When the Soviets officially crossed the
border, he wrote to Carter, saying: "We now have the opportunity of
giving to the USSR its Vietnam War." "Indeed, for almost 10 years,
Moscow had to carry on a war that was unsustainable for the regime, a
conflict that brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup
of the Soviet empire," wrote Glazebrook. "[Asked whether he regretted
the move, which plunged Afghanistan into a conflict which is now into
its fifth decade, he replied 'Regret what? That secret operation was an
excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the
Afghan trap and you want me to regret it?']{.underline} "[Plunging the
Afghan people into a half-century of devastating war was of no
consequence for the likes of Brzezinski. His successors clearly have the
same attitude towards Ukraine]{.underline}," wrote Glazebrook. It was
not Russia alone that invaded Afghanistan, but the Soviet Union, which
included Ukraine. Many Ukrainian troops took part in the invasion and
suffered the "demoralisation" of war, as did all the Soviet Republics,
including Ukraine. The occupation, and the social counter-revolution led
by the decisive sector of the Soviet bureaucracy (organised by the
Communist Party of the USSR) from 1998‒91, led to the breakup of the
Soviet Union. This social counter-revolution overthrew the nationalised,
planned economies of the Soviet Republics and restored capitalism in all
of them, including Russia and Ukraine. The Brzezinski quote brings to
mind one by then-US Secretary of State Madeline Albright in 1996 on 60
Minutes. Leslie Stahl asked Albright whether the sanctions taken against
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait were justified, given the reports
that half a million children had died as a result. Albright answered: "I
think this is a very hard choice, but the price -- we think the price is
worth it." Truman and Roosevelt Glazebrook referenced then-Senator Harry
Truman's comment to President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1941, concerning
the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union during WWII: "If we see that
Germany is winning, we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning,
we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as
possible." In fact, the US held back on opening a "second front" against
Germany and then did so only slowly, starting in northern Africa ---
letting both sides "bleed" in the fighting in the Soviet Union. In the
end, the majority of German casualties in WWII were on the eastern
front. A staggering 25 million soldiers and civilians lost their lives
in the Soviet Union. [The expansion of NATO east was begun under
then-President Bill Clinton in 1997 and continued. **Each expansion
increased tensions with Russia.**]{.underline} **The** US and Britain
pressed for Ukraine and Georgia to become part of NATO, but Germany and
France demurred. A compromise was reached that Ukraine and Georgia would
not join immediately, but would do so in the future. This threat has
been maintained to this day. [Russia correctly views Ukraine joining
NATO as an existential threat and a "red line". Any Russian government,
including the most liberal bourgeois democracy, would do
so.]{.underline} In 2008, acting on the promise that it would join NATO,
Georgia attempted to retake two small Russian-occupied territories. This
led to a short war with Russia, with Georgia believing that NATO would
intervene. It did not. Glazebrook quoted Kent University Professor
Richard Sakwa, a Russia and Ukraine expert, who wrote that, following
the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, "British Foreign Secretary David Miliband
visited Kiev and pledged Britain's support, dooming the country to
becoming the next epicentre of the artificially constructed struggle for
mastery of Europe." 2014 coup The 2014 coup against the elected
president of Ukraine, Victor Yanukovych, was engineered by the US. US
Ambassador Victoria Nuland directly intervened to appoint the new
Ukrainian nationalist government's first president. A few US "experts"
were first part of the new government. Biden's son, Hunter, eventually
joined the Board of Directors of the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma,
in spite of having no experience in the field. After the coup, the new
Ukrainian nationalist government in western Ukraine launched a civil war
against the largely Russian-speaking east. It included downgrading the
legal status of the Russian language. The civil war continued up to the
present, with the NATO countries supporting the Ukrainian nationalists
and Russia the other side. Glazebrook wrote that following the coup,
[NATO staged the Rapid Trident military exercise on Ukrainian territory
on September 15‒16 of that year, a war-gaming exercise involving 15
"allied and partnered nations". "Since then, plans for NATO
incorporation have proceeded apace. A British government document
listing British support to the Ukrainian military outlines these plans
in detail.]{.underline} "[In 2016, NATO outlined its Comprehensive
Assistance Package of 16 'capacity building programmes and several trust
funds for military modernization' whilst 'NATO allies also participate
in a wide range of military exercises with Ukrainian armed forces
through the Military Committee with Ukrainian Work Plan.]{.underline}
"[But it was in June 2020 that this process was really ramped up, when
Ukraine was offered 'Enhanced Opportunity Status' with NATO. Notes the
British document, 'this status provides Ukraine with preferential access
to NATO's exercises' and training." No wonder the Ukrainian government
believed that NATO would back it up if there was an invasion. While the
US said it didn't want a war with Russia, it coyly let the prospect of
NATO intervening remain open.]{.underline} It wasn't until November 2021
that NATO publicly ruled out intervention. Glazebrook's assessment is
that this was the final signal to Russia that it could invade, which
Putin all along wanted to do, in keeping with his avowed intention of
restoring the old Russian empire --- without the tsar, but with Putin as
its head. He received support from the head of the Russian Orthodox
church before the invasion began. Since the invasion, Putin has bombed
Ukrainian and Russian-speaking areas of the country --- including the
largely Russian-speaking city of Mariupol --- causing many Russian
speakers to join the resistance. Since the invasion, Putin has bombarded
not only Ukrainian parts but also of Russian speaking parts of Ukraine,
causing many Russian-speakers to join the resistance. The most egregious
example has been the Russian bombardment and takeover of the largely
Russian-speaking city of Mariupol. In that city and other parts that
Russia has occupied, Putin has denied those people self-determination,
in keeping with his tirade against the Russian Revolution and Lenin for
advocating national self-determination. US will arm Ukraine up to a
point [The US-NATO military buildup of Ukraine has stopped Russia from a
quick victory and has inflicted losses and damage to the Russian
invading forces. **US policy is and will continue to be making sure that
enough military aid from NATO countries is provided to Ukraine to keep
the war going. But it will stop at direct intervention that would mean
Russia's defeat.**]{.underline} The US has built up Ukraine's military
and the civilian far-right militia --- which the US has nurtured since
2014 --- to assure that, if Russia succeeds in forming a weak government
in Ukraine under its tutelage, there would be a massive armed resistance
to continue the "bleeding". [If Russia "wins", it loses]{.underline}.

#### Increasing NATO's power supports a violent, interventionist institution and strains relations with Russia -- Baltic states prove

Mistake,\" American Conservative,

Hal Brands complains about critics of NATO expansion: As for the
critique that it was NATO expansion that provoked Russian revisionism,
this argument has always been flimsy. Yes, the expansion angered Russian
officials, during Yeltsin's time as well as Putin's. It was undoubtedly
humiliating for the fallen superpower. But the idea that NATO expansion
caused Russian aggression rests on an implicit counterfactual argument
that, absent NATO expansion, Russia would not have behaved in a
domineering fashion toward countries on its border. There is simply
nothing in Russian history --- and nothing in Vladimir Putin's
personality --- that supports this argument. NATO expansion has been a
mistake for the U.S. because the U.S. didn't need to add any more
security commitments in Europe or anywhere else after the end of the
Cold War. The collapse of the USSR meant that the threat to European
peace and security had substantially diminished. [There was arguably no
need for NATO at all, much less a larger one. The larger alliance has
not found "new purpose" through expansion, but continues to cast about
looking for some reason to exist now that its only real reason for
being,]{.underline} the Soviet Union, has been dead for almost three
decades. That [first took the form of "humanitarian" **intervention in
Kosovo**]{.underline}, **[an illegal war that set a precedent that
Russia would subsequently exploit]{.underline}**, and then it morphed
into supporting the unending war in Afghanistan. [**In 2011,
"humanitarian" intervention was once again back on the menu as the
alliance was dragged into backing a U.S.-led attack on the Libyan
government that destabilized the country and the surrounding region
until today**. The last twenty years have seen the continued growth of
the alliance at the same time that the alliance has become increasingly
divorced from its original purpose of defending Europe from attack.
**NATO's expansion during that time has been a mistake, and so has
NATO's attempt to reinvent itself for a world where it is no longer
needed.**]{.underline} There is **[no question that NATO expansion has
antagonized Russia and strained U.S.-Russian relations for the last two
decades]{.underline}**. Not every round of NATO expansion has been
equally provocative to Russia, but [all of it has been unwelcome to
them]{.underline}. Bringing [in the Baltic states was a bad idea
primarily because it overextended the alliance and because the U.S. was
extending security guarantees to states that it could not actually
defend.]{.underline} The alliance has been fortunate that it has never
had to back up these commitments. The U.S. and NATO were able to "get
away" with the earlier rounds because Russia was weakened enough during
the 1990s that it wasn't in a position to do anything about them. That
doesn't mean that NATO expansion up until that point was a good idea.
All that it means is that it hasn't blown up in our faces yet. It was
the subsequent attempts to push for bringing Ukraine and Georgia into
the alliance that proved to be truly unacceptable to Russia, and it was
the 2008 Bucharest meeting when the alliance promised both states that
they would eventually become members that paved the way for the conflict
between Russia and Georgia later that year. NATO expansion was not the
cause of the current conflict in Ukraine, but it created the context for
Russia's reaction to the overthrow of Yanukovych and the establishment
of a pro-Western government in Kiev. Had there been no NATO expansion
after the end of the Cold War, or even if there had been no NATO
expansion after 2004, it is unlikely that the August 2008 war and the
current war in Ukraine would have ever happened. [Sold as something that
promotes European stability and peace, continued NATO expansion has in
fact undermined both in the last decade and a half.]{.underline}

### NATO Bad -- Entanglement 

#### Unless the aff is unanimously agreed upon by NATO members, states will entangle others into conflicts to reinvigorate the alliance

The [possibility that the United States and some of its main allies
might pull each other into conflicts besetting non-members, because of
alliance pressures, has not been explicitly examined]{.underline}. My
argument is that when alliance members at first disagree openly about
how to proceed in the face of a security crisis in their neighbourhood,
after a period of deadlock, [concerns about the alliance's perceived
relevance and effectiveness may push the allies to coalesce around an
intervention policy that none of them previously favoured]{.underline}.
In such cases, it is appropriate to speak of mutual entanglement, given
that [the allies pull each other into the resulting military operation.
Mutual entanglement]{.underline}, I argue, is [especially likely for
members of institutionalised alliances, such as NATO, that combine
elements of both a traditional defensive alliance and a collective
security organisation]{.underline}. Members may value the alliance not
just for its mutual security guarantee, but as a symbol of their
collective identity, which can be expected to generate strong incentives
for consensual problem-solving.5 Imagine a situation in which core [NATO
members]{.underline}, notwithstanding pressures to tackle a security
crisis in their neighbourhood, [fail for a considerable time to agree on
a common policy]{.underline}; indeed, they are at odds to such an extent
that [they partly undermine each other. This results in significant
alliance discord and public recriminations.]{.underline} Eventually,
pro[-alliance leaders on different sides of the intra-**NATO dispute,
worried about the alliance's health, start pushing for a joint military
response**]{.underline} **-- [motivated to a significant degree by a
desire to reinvigorate the alliance and signal unity of purpose both
domestically and internationally]{.underline}**. After some pulling and
hauling, [the main alliance members converge around a particular
military intervention policy. The alliance -- specifically, the value
that member states attach to the alliance relationship -- will have
pulled members toward the intervention.]{.underline} This is not a case
of one side in an alliance dragging other members into a military
conflict. Instead, the allies have pulled each other toward intervention
in a non-member state; [they have mutually entangled each
other.]{.underline}
