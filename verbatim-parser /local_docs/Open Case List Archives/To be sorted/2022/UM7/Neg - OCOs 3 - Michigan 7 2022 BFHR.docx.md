# Neg -- OCOs 3 -- BFHR

### notes

Thanks a ton to Sam Gordon and Paul Wallace for their work this wave!
Please email <khirn10@gmail.com> with any comments or concerns.

Many cyber affs\-\--including OCOs and space\-\--clearly have
interactions with the 'Article 5' debate. I figured that 1acs should
have the option of explicitly designing their plan to include an attempt
at pressuring NATO to agree on appropriate Article 5 thresholds for what
constitutes an armed attack with regards to cybersecurity. The aff/neg
file is thus designed as a supplement, with defensible and distinct
impact mods both for and against changing the threshold.

The DAs in this file are essentially deterrence and assurance, the links
assuming the aff attempts to establish some cyberattacks as falling
short of meeting the threshold of 'armed attack'. The "Lower A5
Threshold" DA is meant for a hypothetical aff that **lowered** the
Article 5 threshold, functionally saying "all cyberattacks are armed
attacks and we will respond accordingly." The aff material in "OCOs 3"
doesn't support this angle, but I could envision somewhat putting it
together.

[[Deliberations on]{.mark} thresholds triggering [Article 5]{.mark}
could [prove **particularly thorny**, given]{.mark} the **[transatlantic
divide]{.mark}** in views on what consequences are necessary to
constitute an armed attack]{.underline}.

[For example, the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [may
be willing to consider a **lower threshold** than its **less eager
European allies** for whom only grave uses of force are considered an
armed attack]{.underline}. A state's view of this threshold may well
depend on whether it is the victim of an attack or a member called upon
to fulfill its collective-defense obligation.

Additionally, [Article 5 does not **define** the nature of that
commitment]{.underline}. The treaty allows a member state to take
whatever action it deems appropriate to assist an attacked ally---it
decides how it will respond in collective defense. A member state may
interpret its obligation to respond expansively or in a far more limited
manner. So by viewing its Article 5 obligation in a limited way, a
member could determine that it is not required to respond with kinetic
force to assist an attacked ally, even in cases of destructive
cyberevents.

[[Given]{.mark} the [**capability**, **doctrinal** and **policy divide**
between]{.mark} NATO [members in]{.mark} the **[cyber]{.mark}arena**, an
ally might limit its response to entirely nonkinetic
measures]{.underline}, such as rerouting Internet traffic through its
national network, monitoring networks for future attacks,
crisis-management support or diplomatic statements on behalf of the
attacked ally.

On the other hand, if NATO determines a cyberattack amounts to an armed
attack and invokes Article 5, and undertakes responsive action against
an aggressor, member states are not limited to cyber-responses alone;
they may also choose to employ kinetic force in the collective defense
of the attacked member state. Adoption of this cyberpolicy provides NATO
states a wider range of potential options with which they may respond in
cases of destructive cyberattacks. NATO allies may respond with cyber-
or kinetic tools, or a combination of both, a fact that may help to
ensure an Alliance-wide response.

Regardless of the political weight presently attributed to NATO's
expected policy statement, law and policy are inextricably intertwined
in the interpretation of Article 5, and [the [**subtleties** of]{.mark}
its **[real-world application]{.mark}** may [make it
**difficult**]{.mark} for the organization [to offer]{.mark} the
[assurances]{.mark} certain allies]{.underline} are seeking with respect
to their defense against cyberattacks. [As a result, the policy could
**fall far short** of its intended goals]{.underline}.

NATO states could, however, decide to make adoption of its new
cyberpolicy a true game changer, to ensure that it becomes a useful
framework for addressing the rapidly changing security challenges posed
in the cyber-realm.

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} nations [[might]{.mark} begin]{.underline}
this process [by **[reexamin]{.mark}**ing [the threshold]{.mark}
requirement [for Article 5]{.mark} application in response to
cyberattacks]{.underline}. States could agree, for example, that
although some cyberevents may well cause consequential kinetic results
(and some of a truly horrific nature), in the cyberworld, requiring
kinetic consequences in order to trigger application of the
collective-defense requirement does not fully reflect the types of
serious crises cyberattacks can trigger.

They could determine, rather, that the appropriate Article 5 threshold
in response to cyberevents might also be triggered by the far more
likely consequences of large-scale economic disruption with
corresponding national- and international-security implications.

[[This]{.mark}, of course, would [require **all twenty-eight** members
to **reconsider**]{.mark} their [**long-established views** on]{.mark}
what constitutes an **[armed attack]{.mark}** under international law,
[and]{.mark} to **[achieve consensus]{.mark}** on a far more
forward-leaning approach. This would, no doubt, be a **[hugely
difficult]{.mark}** undertaking]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the
development of international law is a continuous process, and states and
international organizations should move to adapt it to help meet
changing threats.

[[The **Cult** of the **(Cyber) Offensive**]{.underline}]{.mark}

International security scholars and military officials widely agree that
cyberspace favors offensive operations (see Nye 2015a, b; Lonergan 2016;
Sheldon 2011; Libicki 2009, 32--33; Clarke and Knake 2010; Vanca 2013;
Saltzman 2013, 43; Lindsay 2015, 52; Lucas 2017, 127). According to
traditional offense/defense theory, when offense holds the advance it is
relatively easier to 'move forward, destroy and conquer territory' than
to protect and defend it (Jervis 1978; Evera and Stephen 1984; Glaser
and Kaufman 1998).Footnote10 Cyber experts list three main reasons why
offensive strategies have an upper hand in cyberspace. First, as Sheldon
observes, "attacks in cyberspace occur at great speed...putting defenses
under immense pressure, as an attacker has to be successful only once,
whereas the defender has to be successful all of the time" (Sheldon
2011, 98). Second, the prospect of launching attacks with relative
anonymity (and therefore impunity) lowers the expected cost of offensive
strategies in cyberspace (see Sheldon 2011, 98; Lindsay 2015). Third,
physical distance is relatively inconsequential in the virtual world.
Cyberattacks can emerge practically from anywhere, providing significant
latitude for attackers to seize the initiative and catch defenders by
surprise (Nye 2010; Sheldon 2011, 98). Another way of stating this point
is that cyber technologies lead to great improvements in the mobility
and reach of force---both factors held to increase offensive advantage
(see Glaser and Kaufman 1998, 62).

The International relations (IR) theory points to four main strategic
implications of offensive dominance. First, when offense is strong
relative to defense, it becomes imperative for states to react quickly
and resolutely to emerging threats, since even a small initial shift in
the ratio of capabilities can cause a decisive shift in actors' ability
to prevail in a conflict (van Evera 1984, 64). In a cyber context, the
compulsion to act and react fast is further amplified by the changing
vulnerability of most cyber targets. Cyber weapons consist of complex
software designed to exploit vulnerabilities residing in other software,
such as computer operations systems or industrial control systems (Lucas
2017, 7). Unlike most conventional targets, a given cyber target may
therefore only be vulnerable---and a cyber weapon aimed at that target
only potentially effective---until the point at which a string of code
is fixed or the target is replaced (DOD 2006, 3). The implication,
according to many cyber experts, is that, "if you do not act quickly,
you may not be able to act at all" (Vanca 2013, 26. See also Buchanan
2016; Lonergan 2016; Lindsay 2015, 56).

A second implication of offensive advantage is to encourage arms racing.
As Glaser and Kaufman (1998, 48) explain, when offense is strong, states
are likely to find that equally sized forces are inadequate to support a
defensive strategy. Instead, they are likely to conclude that they
require a substantial lead in military force to defend against attacks.
This triggers a dynamic of competitive arms building, whereby even
states that merely wish to defend the status quo strive to build up
their military arsenals at a faster pace than their competitors in order
to secure an adequate defense.

A third effect of offensive advantage is to increase rewards for
striking first, thereby increasing the probability of preemptive or
preventive attacks (Jervis 1978; van Evera 1984). In the cyber domain,
incentives to attack enemies preemptively arise partly from the fact
that actions in cyberspace move so fast that they leave little time for
targeted states to mount a defense (Clarke and Knake 2010). The
motivation to strike first may be further reinforced by the prospect of
using carefully targeted cyber-strikes to neutralize an enemy's
conventional defense systems and thereby limit its retaliatory capacity
(Saltzman 2013, 44). Indeed, many military strategists believe that
preemptive strikes in the cyber domain are likely to bring decisive
advantages on the conventional battlefield (see, e.g., Clarke and Knake
2010).

Fourth, according to IR theory, when offense is strong relative to
defense, the ability to deter attacks (as opposed to seeking to defend
against them) becomes vital. Logically, in a strategic environment that
is thought to favor offensive operations, the ability to deter
aggressors hinges crucially on the ability to signal or demonstrate
superior offensive capabilities. Hence, according to traditional
offense/defense theory, the surest way to achieve effective strategic
cyber deterrence is to develop strong offensive capabilities, which
promise crushing retaliation against would-be attackers.

To sum up, conventional IR theory points to four strategic implications
of cyber offensive advantage: (1) an emphasis on fast action, (2) a
tendency towards arms-racing, (3) strong incentives for preemptive
attacks, (4) a focus on boosting deterrence through enhancing offensive
capabilities. These implications of cyber offensive advantage are not
merely "theoretical." The importance of taking fact action is emphasized
in leading national cyber security strategies. According to the US
"National Military Strategy for Cyberspace,"

Cyberspace affords commanders opportunities to make decisions rapidly,
conduct operations, and deliver effects at speeds that were previously
incomprehensible. In addition, increasing the speed of the policy and
decision-making process potentially will yield greater effectiveness of
cyberspace capabilities. (US DOD 2006, 4).

[The [**perceived need** to]{.mark} boost [**offensive**
capabilities]{.mark} as a means [to **strengthen deterrence** is]{.mark}
also **clearly [articulated]{.mark}** [in many]{.mark} **strategic
[documents]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} in **public [statements]{.mark}** [by
**defense officials**]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote11 Admiral Michael S.
Rogers, Commander of the US Military Cyber Command, has repeatedly
pointed to the need to "increase our capacity on the offensive side to
get to that point of deterrence."Footnote12 Similarly, in a press
conference in April 2015, US Air Force Chief of Staff Mark Welsh
described the Pentagon's goal of developing cyber weapons that could
inflict "blunt force trauma" on an enemy in order to deter aggressors
(see Ewing 2015). The Trump Administration has also signaled an
aggressive cyber position. During his presidential campaign, Donald
Trump repeatedly vowed to expand America's offensive cyber
capabilities---a commitment that has been followed up by plans for a 15%
increase in military cyber-security spending in the DOD's 2017 budget
(see Gady 2017).Footnote13

[Other nations]{.underline} appear to be **[draw]{.underline}**ing
similar [conclusions regarding the need to adopt **more offensive**
cyber postures.]{.underline} Russia, Iran, and North Korea all have
military units specifically dedicated to offensive cyber operations (NY
Times 2016). Since 2005, China has begun to incorporate offensive
computer network operations into its military exercises, primarily in
comprehensive first strikes against enemy networks (Salzman 2013, 51),
and the Chinese have recently admitted the existence of purely offensive
cyber units in the PLA (according to Raud 2016, 20--21). [The
**[Germans]{.mark}** have publicly disclosed that they [are developing
offensive cyber]{.mark} weapons]{.underline} (Limnéll 2013) [[as
are]{.underline}]{.mark} Argentina and [[**France**. Even **Denmark**
and]{.mark} the **[Netherlands]{.mark}** have [launched programs]{.mark}
to develop cyber offensive capabilities]{.underline} (Paletta, Yadron
and Valentino-Devries 2015).

[In short, **[current]{.mark} political and military [leaders]{.mark}**
[focus **overwhelmingly** on]{.mark} improving their countries' cyber
[**offensive** capabilities and]{.mark} appear to **[premise]{.mark}**
national cyber security [strategies on]{.mark} a [**firm belief** that
defensive]{.mark} strategies [are **insufficient**]{.mark} to deter
enemies in cyberspace]{.underline}. This strategic environment is
strongly reminiscent of the "Cult of the Offensive" that swept Europe in
the decades prior to World War I.Footnote14 Much like political and
military leaders prior to WWI, [today's decision-makers]{.underline}
appear to [display [a]{.mark} "highly exaggerated **[faith]{.mark}** in
the efficacy of offensive military strategies and tactics"]{.underline}
(Van Evera 1984). And, much like political and military planners prior
to WWI, they tend to discount the power of political factors (including
the rule of international law) which may favor defenders.

University School of Law and is currently a Research Associate at the

Article 5 is useful for assessing state and non-state actions used in
traditional warfare. However, the **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** allies
drafted Article 5 in light of the technology and tactics of the World
War II era. While NATO continued to successfully adapt Article 5 to the
evolving challenges post-Soviet Union, it [[cannot]{.mark} properly
[invoke]{.mark}]{.underline} the principle of [**[c]{.mark}**ollective
**[s]{.mark}**elf-**[d]{.mark}**efense]{.underline} [against cyber
attacks [without]{.mark}]{.underline} at least **[[new
definitions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for the various forms of cyber
events]{.underline}. In particular, [[without **unambiguous
guidelines**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for identifying from where a cyber
attack originated, [NATO will face]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[difficulty]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in both **[locating]{.mark}** the
origin of a cyber attack]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[determining]{.underline}**]{.mark} whether the cyber
[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark} was sanctioned by the host nation. Also,
**[[without]{.mark} proper [definitions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for the
various forms of cyber attacks, [NATO will]{.mark} likely [encounter
**unnecessary debate between**]{.mark} **NATO
[allies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [over any cyber attack against a NATO
country]{.underline}. [Furthermore, [without removing
**ambiguity**]{.mark} in **identifying** cyber events that equate to a
traditional armed attack, [the]{.mark} North Atlantic [**Council** will
face difficulty]{.mark} in **[deciding]{.mark}** [upon a]{.mark}
**proper and [proportionate]{.mark}** armed
**[response]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in accord with the principles of jus
in bello]{.underline}.

Currently, [almost [every]{.mark} NATO [ally has an
**individual**]{.mark} national]{.underline} security and defense
**[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** related to cybersecurity.\[12\]
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} strategies [vary in detail and scope, and
[lack **uniformity**]{.mark}]{.underline} in defining the elements of
which cyber attacks warrant an aggressive response. Some scholars argue
that the International Court of Justice accurately determined that
collective self-defense is triggered when an act "inflicts substantial
destruction upon important elements of the target state," even if the
attackers used non-traditional weaponry like airplanes or cyber
attacks.\[13\] [For instance, this "[**scale and effects" test** does
**not**]{.mark} **adequately [address]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the
**technical differences**]{.mark} [between]{.mark} using

major **disturbance**, with or without]{.underline} [any physical

basis** without **predetermined** specialized **rules**, [the **various

https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/28802-EN-cyber-attacks-and-international-law-of-armed-conflicts-a-jus-ad-bellum-perspecti.pdf

The opposing side argues that [the reference to 'inherent' **right**
of]{.underline} **[self-defense]{.underline}** [preserves ancient
customary law]{.underline}, [which allowed the **anticipatory
action**]{.underline}.33 [Proponents of a **broad reading** of
self-defense invoke]{.underline} the 1837 **[Caroline]{.underline}**
incident [and suggest that in the nuclear era States **cannot be
expected** to **wait** for a '**first strike'**.]{.underline} However
[the [majority]{.mark} of scholars **[reject]{.mark} the precedent
value**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the
**[[Caroline]{.underline}]{.mark}** incident [based on the fact that it
**precedes** the **actual interdiction** for the use of
force.]{.underline} [34[They warn of]{.mark} the **risk of
[escalation]{.mark}** that results from accepting **anticipatory**
actions.]{.underline} We think that [the]{.underline} **[latter reason
should prevail]{.underline}** [in the case of cyber-attack and as such,
anticipatory **self defense** should be clearly **banned**]{.underline}.
ii) Interceptive self defense If an armed attack is incipient or is on
the verge of beginning, the intended victim may not wait powerlessly for
the inevitable blow. The attack can be legitimately intercepted. In fact
interceptive (different from anticipatory) self-defense seems to be
acceptable under the Charter.35 The theme of interceptive self-defense
is pertinent to a computer attack when the intrusion into a computer
network has been discovered, although it is not yet lethal to persons or
destructive of property (using Schmitt's analysis). [The issue is to
determine whether the intrusion may]{.underline} [reasonably be seen as
a **first step**]{.underline} [of an **unavoidable** and
developing]{.underline} 'armed **[attack']{.underline}**. [This is a
very difficult matter of **evaluating** and]{.underline}
**[interpreting]{.underline}** [info]{.underline}rmation available at
the time of action (including warnings, intelligence reports and other
data). 4. New Horizons and Challenges In the following section [we will
lance a debate about possible use of **cyber means**]{.underline} [as
self-defense]{.underline} or over the boundaries of the classical
international paradigm (armed force or armed attack). [[There are
numerous]{.underline}]{.mark} theoretical and **[[practical
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}** to be relived in this exploratory
topic. 4.1 Computer Attacks as Means of Self Defense If a preceding
armed attack (or a computer attack qualified as 'armed attack'
--according to Schmitt's analysis) occurred, the possibility to use the
computer attacks as legitimate defense seem obvious (legitimate defense
allows the use of all military means against an aggression therefore the
cyber means should be included). [However there are two]{.underline}
**[substantive constraints]{.underline}** [for the right of
**self-defense**]{.underline}: [the criteria of **necessity** and
**proportionality**]{.underline}. In the Nicaragua case, the
International Court of Justice acknowledged the 'inherent' right of
self-defense as part of customary law. The Court recognized the two
criteria, 'necessity' and 'proportionality', as additional requirements
under Article 51.36 i) '**[Necessity']{.underline}** 'Necessity' [means
that no alternative way of redress may be available and the target
should be a military one, in agreement with the rules of International
humanitarian law]{.underline} ("jus in bello"). Likewise,
'**[necessity']{.underline}** [requires that the timing between the
armed attack and the recourse to self-defense to be **reasonably
short**]{.underline}, [taking]{.underline} [into account the need to
carry out investigations]{.underline} and/or negotiations, [or to make
military preparations]{.underline} (this is an upper time limit while
the above discussed interceptive self-defense concerned the lower time
limit). ii) 'Proportionality'
**[['Proportionality']{.underline}]{.mark}**, on the other hand,
[supposes that the use of self-defense will be weighed against initial
**armed attack(s**]{.underline}), [not only in terms of
gravity]{.underline}/intensity, [but also in terms of duration,
location, and range]{.underline} of selected targets. And [here [lays a
**real problem** for]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**cyber**]{.mark}-attack
qualifying as **self-defense**]{.underline}. [Computer [attacks
are]{.mark} naturally **[uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as
to]{.mark} the **[outcome]{.mark}** they produce, [making difficult to
estimate]{.mark} **deliberate** and collateral]{.underline}
**[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact [the consequences of a
cyber-attack may be both **direct** and **indirect**]{.underline}, [and
in some cases the indirect consequences can be **higher**]{.underline}
than direct consequences.37 As result [[it is very difficult to
fulfill]{.mark} the **criteria of [proportionality]{.mark}**
in]{.underline} [case of a self-defense]{.underline} by way of
cyber-attacks. [The **risk of escalation**]{.underline} [should prevent
this use of cyber-attacks in the]{.underline} present [international
framework]{.underline}. An eventual solution may be revealed by
technological breakthroughs that will allow controlling the outcome of
cyber-attacks. But this kind of technological evolution is far from
being assured yet. 4.2 Difficulties on the Boundaries of Classical
Paradigm: Cyber Means Not Qualifying as "Armed Force" or "Armed Attack"
Much more appealing might be an analysis of the use of cyber-attacks in
response to an initial act (a computer network attack) not achieving the
threshold of "armed attack" (Schmitt's criteria). i) Computer network
attacks not achieving the threshold of "armed attack" If an initial
(cyber) attack does not reach the threshold of an"armed attack" there is
no right of selfdefense. We should examine the case of a computer attack
used in retaliation short of the right to selfdefense. This situation is
not purely hypothetical since there are plans to use computer attacks as
counter offensive instruments. For example Col. Charles W. Williamson 38
argued that an Air Force-controlled 'botnet' could be a cost-effective
mean to protect military networks. He envisioned collecting computers
that would otherwise be discarded and remove their hard drives by making
them available to launch attacks against foreign-based computers
targeting American military facilities. To prevent collateral damage
this 'botnet' would have built-in filters preventing US military and
government computers from being targeted. We think that Schmitt's
threshold of an "armed attack" by cyber means (and the corresponding
right to self-defense) is not attained in the example above. At this
point [we are considering a [non-military
'**retal**]{.mark}iation']{.underline}. However [this kind of action
[brings]{.mark} up **[tremendous risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} **[cyber escalation]{.underline}** [linked to the
obvious indiscriminate nature of computer attacks. All those affected by
this computer **retaliation**]{.underline} [may react with
**devastating**]{.underline} (deliberate and collateral) [effects to
networks]{.underline}. [This outcome could, by **aggregation** and
**escalation**]{.underline}, [finally **trigger** a **classical armed
conflict**]{.underline}. [The dangers are **too high to
consider**]{.underline} [this kind of action]{.underline}. i) The
exception of espionage and the challenge of multi-purpose nature of
cyber means If there is no destructive outcome (lacking the threshold in
Schmitt's analysis) the cyber means could be covered by the espionage
exception in interstate relations. These are harmful actions (not
illegal from the point of view of armed conflict) that each state use
constantly. Nevertheless some problems related to the nature of cyber
means remain unclear. [Cyber means are by nature **multi-purpose**
tools]{.underline} ('weapons'). [The methods used for computer network
exploitation are similar to those used for computer network
attack]{.underline}, but configured for different objectives. For
example the Wall Street Journal claimed 39 that some [agents from China
and Russia]{.underline}, along with several other countries, had
[infiltrated computer systems]{.underline} [charged with managing
electricity]{.underline} in the US. They left behind software which
could be used to control or disable electric grids of the country.
[Security experts stated that while the incident showed
**gaps**]{.underline} in the US security infrastructure in time of
conflict, [such an attack could have **catastrophic
effects**]{.underline}. In this case, a cyber-activity
(intelligence-gathering) can easily become, if undetected, the ground
for a future cyber-attack. In situations like this, the only solution
for the offended State is to use its own cyber exploitation or cyber
defense instruments while the use of computer attacks in retaliation
would be the least reasonable choice (even less reasonable than in the
above example of cyber retaliation to a previous computer attack not
qualifying as "armed attack"). [This is another example where classical
**[armed conflict framework]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[seems **unable** to
cover]{.mark} certain **[cyber]{.mark} means**
characteristics]{.underline}.

### AT: Hybrid War\-\--1NC

#### [Non-cyber]{.underline} hybrid war thumps Baltic conflict

**Fisher 15** \[Max, 6/29/2015, "How World War III became possible",
Vox, <https://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war#hybridwar>\]

This poll is even worse than it looks. It assumes that Russia would
launch an overt military invasion of the Baltics. [What would actually
happen is something far **murkier**, and far more likely to leverage
European hesitation: the **playbook from Ukraine**, where Russia
deployed its newly developed]{.underline} concepts of postmodern
[[\"**hybrid war**,\" designed to **blur**]{.mark} **the [distinction
between war and not-war]{.mark}**, to [make it]{.mark} **as
[difficult]{.mark} as possible [to differentiate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[grassroots unrest]{.underline}]{.mark} or vigilante [**[cyberattacks
from Russian]{.mark} military
[aggression]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**Putin may already be laying the groundwork**.]{.underline}

In March of 2014, shortly after Russia had annexed Crimea, Putin gave a
speech there pledging to protect Russians even outside of Russia, which
many took as a gesture to the substantial Russian minorities in the
Baltics.

Then, in October, Putin warned that \"open manifestations of
neo-Nazism\" had \"become commonplace in Latvia and other Baltic
states\" --- repeating the language that he and Russian state media had
earlier used to frighten Russian speakers in Ukraine into taking up
arms.

This April, several Russian outlets issued spurious reports that Latvia
was planning to forcibly relocate ethnic Russians into Nazi-style
ghettos --- an echo of similar scaremongering Russian propaganda
broadcast in the runup in Ukraine.

Martin Hurt, a former senior official of the country\'s defense
ministry, warned that his country\'s ethnic Russian minority could be
\"receptive to Kremlin disinformation.\" [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark},
he said, [[could generate unrest \"as a **pretext to use military
force** against the **Baltic s**]{.mark}**tates**.\"]{.underline}

In early 2007, Estonia\'s parliament voted to relocate a Soviet-era
military statue, the Bronze Soldier, that had become a cultural symbol
and annual rallying point for the country\'s ethnic Russians. In
response, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n politicians and state media
accused the Estonian government of fascism and Nazi-style discrimination
against ethnic Russians; they [[issued false reports claiming ethnic
Russians were being tortured and murdered. Protests broke
out]{.underline}]{.mark} and escalated into riots and mass looting. One
person was killed in the violence, and the next day hackers took many of
the country\'s major institutions offline.

[[Russia could]{.underline}]{.mark} do it again, only this time
**[[gradually escalat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [further toward a
Ukraine-style conflict. **[NATO is]{.mark} just [not built to deal with
such a crisis]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Its mutual defense
pledge]{.underline}, after all, [rests on the assumption that war is a
black-and-white concept]{.underline}, that a country is either at war or
not at war. [[Its charter]{.mark} is from a time when war was very
different than it is today, [with]{.mark} its many [**shades of
gray**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**[Russia can exploit this flaw]{.mark}** by [introducing **low-level
violence**]{.mark} that more [hawkish]{.mark} NATO [members would
consider]{.mark} **grounds for [war]{.mark}**]{.underline} but that
war-averse Western European states might not see that way.
[**Disagreement among NATO\'s member states would be guaranteed** as
they hesitated over where to declare a moment when Russia had crossed
the line into war.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [[Russia]{.mark}n state media]{.underline}, which has shown
real influence in Western Europe, [[would unleash]{.mark} a flurry of
**propaganda** to confuse the issue]{.underline}, make it harder to pin
blame on Moscow for the violence, and gin up skepticism of any American
calls for war.

[Germany]{.underline}, which is widely considered the deciding vote on
whether Europe would go to war, [would be particularly resistant to
going to war.]{.underline} The legacy of World War II and the ideology
of pacifism and compromise make even the idea of declaring war on Russia
unthinkable. [German leaders would come under intense political pressure
to]{.underline}, if not reject the call to arms, then [at least delay
and negotiate --- a de facto **rejection of NATO\'s collective
self-defense**.]{.underline}

In such a scenario, it is disturbingly easy to imagine how
[**[NATO\'s]{.mark} European [member]{.mark} state[s could
split]{.mark}** over [whether Russia]{.mark} had even [crossed their red
line]{.mark} for war, much less whether to respond. [Under a **fog of
confusion**]{.mark}]{.underline} and doubt, [**[Russia could]{.mark}
gradually [escalate]{.mark}** [until]{.mark} a Ukraine-style **[conflict
in the Baltics was foregone]{.mark}**]{.underline}, until it had marched
far across NATO\'s red line, [exposing that red line as
meaningless.]{.underline}

But the greatest danger of all is if Putin\'s plan were to stumble: [[By
**overreaching**]{.mark}, by underestimating Western resolve to defend
the Baltics, or by starting something that escalates beyond his control,
[it could]{.mark} all too easily [lead to **full-blown
war**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"That kind of [**[misperception]{.mark}** situation [is]{.mark}
definitely [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [that's how wars
start]{.underline},\" Saideman said, going on to compare Europe today
with 1914, just before World War I. \"The thing that makes war most
thinkable is when other people don't think it's thinkable.\"

In 1963, a few months after the Cuban missile crisis had almost brought
the US and Soviet Union to blows, President John F. Kennedy gave a
speech drawing on the lessons of the world\'s brush with nuclear war:

\"Above all, [while defending our vital interests, [nuclear powers must
avert]{.mark} those [confrontations which bring an adversary to]{.mark}
a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a [**nuclear
war**.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

[That is the choice that **Putin may well force upon
NATO**.]{.underline}

At the same time, [NATO should aim to deter specific types of
particularly threatening unconventional activities]{.underline}. These
include major and sophisticated cyber attacks against allies' military
forces and critical military and civilian infrastructure, proxy military
and special forces operations, and state-sponsored terrorism. NATO could
declare that such activities may lead it to invoke Article 5 and respond
in various ways, including asymmetrically (for example, the response to
a cyber attack may not involve only cyber capabilities).

The alliance must be able to identify early whether and when
unconventional and hybrid gray-zone actions have become a more
substantial and coordinated campaign. In such a case, NATO should aim to
deter the adversary from escalating further. This requires increasing
the alliance's capacity to share early-warning intelligence and pool
national intelligence-gathering, investigation, and attribution
capabilities. NATO should not shy away from attributing ongoing
operations to state adversaries, relying on national data as needed. The
alliance and its members should be prepared to use direct channels of
communication and other means to deliver immediate deterrence signaling
in specific cases.

[from loose groups to **terrorist** and criminal networks]{.underline}

**[[Coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [with regional partners in

[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} [primary]{.underline}
[[task]{.underline}]{.mark}, as elsewhere, [[should be to

**[unconventional tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against **NATO** and
its allies]{.underline}, [[using **signaling**]{.mark} and
**attribution** tools]{.underline}. When possible, the alliance should
aim to affect the calculus of nonstate actors to prevent them from
harming alliance interests. This may not work with jihadist groups but
may be possible with actors motivated by political or economic
interests.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and its **[[revisionist]{.mark}
behaviour]{.underline}** [[present]{.mark} the **[Baltic
S]{.mark}**tates [with]{.mark} a multitude of
**[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [making deterrence a]{.underline}
]{.mark}**[top [priority]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Baltic Region.
[Not only does [Moscow wish to extend its]{.mark} **[s]{.mark}phere
[o]{.mark}f [i]{.mark}nfluence**]{.underline} to include what it
describes as 'near abroad', [it must carefully protect its own model of
'**sovereign democracy'**]{.underline} at home. Prior to Russian
involvement, Ukraine was getting close to signing an association
agreement with the European Union (EU) and it was feared that
'democratic change in brotherly Ukraine could spread to Russia'.
[Transforming Ukraine to a western democracy was seen as a
**threat**]{.underline} [to the Russian regime and was thus stymied at
its source]{.underline} (Snegovaya, 2014). However, the Baltic States
have already been fully integrated into NATO and the (EU) and have been
stable democracies for over two decades now. So what is the nature of
the threat that Russia presents to the Baltic States?

[Putin is using **[hybrid tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as a means of
achieving his objectives of a **politically [restructure]{.mark}d
[Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These include]{.underline} massive
[pro-Russian **[propaganda]{.mark}**]{.underline} and misinformation
campaigns, using **[economic levers]{.underline}**,
[**[intimidation]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
employment of **[cyber]{.mark} war**]{.underline}f[are]{.underline}
elements. [In Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014, [Russia]{.underline} has
once again [demonstrated its resolve to use both military and
non-military means]{.underline} to create and fuel conflicts in pursuit
of its wider geopolitical interests. The Kremlin is busily trying to
regain its sphere of influence over nations that were formerly part of
the Soviet Union, and the Baltic States' governments are continuously
being reminded to stay alert. In addition, **[NATO frontier
allies]{.underline}** [face much more **significant
threats**]{.underline} [due to their proximity to the potential
**aggressor**]{.underline} (Grygiel and Mitchell, 2016, p. 166). [Thus,
what **[NATO needs]{.mark} most** to deter Russia is ['to
demonstrate]{.mark} **robust political [solidarity]{.mark}**[']{.mark}
within the alliance]{.underline} (NATO Parliamentary Assembly Report,
2015, pp. 4-6). [There has been a significant]{.underline}
**[increase]{.underline}** [in Russian **[probing]{.mark}** activities
to [gauge]{.mark} NATO's **[commitment]{.mark}** to the Baltic States
over the past two years]{.underline}. Grygiel and Mitchell (2016, p. 43)
define Russian probing as a 'lowmintensity and low-risk test aimed at
gauging the opposing state´s power and will to maintain security and
influence over a region'. In case of the Baltic States, [probing is
aimed at the]{.underline} **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the
strongest European countries, their power and their [will to back
up]{.mark} their most **exposed [allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As
mentioned by Grygiel and Mitchell (2016, p. 122), '[there is a strong
correlation between the **existence** of **alliances** in a given region
and the **effectiveness of deterrence**]{.underline} against a
threatening power'. [Building on the **allies' fear of abandonment** and
**US fear of entrapment** in local **conflicts**, [Russia is aiming to
**hinder**]{.mark} **their [relations]{.mark}hips** [which]{.mark} could
ultimately [provide Moscow]{.mark} with more [room for
**probing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[manoeuvring]{.underline}** [in the Baltic Region]{.underline}.

Hybrid or conventional?

#### Global war

Studies, Charles Edel, Senior Fellow and Visiting Scholar at the U.S.

https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/hal-brands/the-disharmony-of-the-spheres/

To see this, just work backward from the present. During the Cold War, a
bipolar balance did help avert actual war between Moscow and Washington.
But even in Europe---where the spheres of influence were best
defined---there were continual tensions and crises as Moscow tested the
Western bloc. And outside Europe, violence and proxy wars were common as
the superpowers competed to extend their reach into the Third World. In
the 1930s, the [emergence of **[German]{.mark}** and [**Japanese**
**spheres**]{.mark}]{.underline} of influence [[led to]{.mark} the
**most [catastrophic war]{.mark} in** global **history**]{.underline}.
The [empires of the **19th
century**]{.underline}---[spheres]{.underline} of influence [in their
own right]{.underline}---[continually **jostled**]{.underline} one
another, [leading to **wars**]{.underline} and near-wars over the course
of decades; the Peace of Amiens between England and Napoleonic France
lasted a mere 14 months. And looking back to the ancient world, there
were not one, but [**three** **Punic Wars** fought between Rome and
Carthage as two expanding empires came into conflict. A world defined by
**[s]{.mark}**pheres **[o]{.mark}**f **[i]{.mark}**nfluence [is]{.mark}
often a world [**characterized** by **tensions**, **wars**, and
competition]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The reasons for this are simple. As the political scientist William
Wohlforth observed, unipolar systems---such as the U.S.-dominated
post--Cold War order---are anchored by a hegemonic power that can act
decisively to maintain the peace. In a unipolar system, Wohlforth
writes, there are few incentives for revisionist powers to incur the
"focused enmity" of the leading state. Truly multipolar systems, by
contrast, have often been volatile. When the major powers are more
evenly matched, there is a greater temptation to aggression by those who
seek to change the existing order of things. And seek to change things
they undoubtedly will.

The idea that spheres of influence are stabilizing holds only if one
assumes that the major powers are motivated only by insecurity and that
concessions to the revisionists will therefore lead to peace. Churchill
described this as the idea that if one "feeds the crocodile enough, the
crocodile will eat him last."

Unfortunately, today's rising or resurgent powers are also
motivated---as is America---by honor, ambition, and the timeless desire
to make their international habitats reflect their own interests and
ideals. It is a risky gamble indeed, then, to think that **[[ceding
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** or **[China]{.underline}** an uncontested
sphere of influence [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} turn a revisionist
authoritarian regime into a satisfied power. The result, as Robert Kagan
has noted, might be to **[[embolden]{.underline}]{.mark}** those actors
all the more, by [giving them **freer rein** to bring]{.underline} their
[**near-abroads under control**, **greater latitude** and **resources**
to **[pursue]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [**[ambitions]{.mark}**, and
**[enhanced confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[the
**U.S**]{.mark}**.-led [order is fracturing]{.mark}** at its
**foundations**. For **China**, dominance over the **first island
chain** might simply **intensify** desires to achieve **primacy** in the
**second**]{.underline} island chain and beyond; [for **Russia**,
**renewed mastery** in the **former Soviet space** could lead to desires
to [bring]{.mark} parts of the former [Warsaw Pact to heel]{.mark}, as
well.]{.underline} To observe how China is developing ever longer-range
anti-access/area denial capabilities, or how Russia has been projecting
military power ever farther afield, is to see this process in action.

The **[[reemergence]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a spheres-of-influence
world [would]{.underline} thus **[[undercut]{.underline}]{.mark}** one
of the great historical achievements of U.S. foreign policy: the
creation of a system in which America is the dominant power in each
major geopolitical region and can act decisively to shape events and
protect its interests. [It would foster an environment in which
**[democratic values]{.mark}** are **less prominent**, **authoritarian**
models are **ascendant**, and mercantilism advances as **economic
[openness recedes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And rather than leading to
multipolar stability, this change could simply [[encourage]{.mark}
**greater [revisionism]{.mark}** on the part of powers whose **appetite
grows** with]{.underline} the **[eating]{.underline}**. This would lead
the world away from the relative stability of the post--Cold War era and
back into the darker environment it seemed to have relegated to history
a quarter-century ago. The phrase "spheres of influence" may sound
vaguely theoretical and benign, but its real-world effects are likely to
be tangible and pernicious.

Fortunately, the [return of a **s**pheres-**o**f-**i**nfluence **world**
is not yet inevitable]{.underline}. Even as some nations will accept
incorporation into a Chinese or Russian sphere of influence as the price
of avoiding conflict, or maintaining access to critical markets and
resources, others will resist because they see their own well-being as
dependent on the preservation of the world order that Washington has
long worked to create. The Philippines and Cambodia seem increasingly to
fall into the former group; Poland and Japan, among many others, make up
the latter. The [**[willingness]{.mark}** of even this **latter group**
[to]{.mark} take actions that [risk]{.mark} **incurring
[Beijing]{.mark}** [and **Moscow's wrath**]{.mark}]{.underline},
however, [[will be]{.mark} **constantly [calibrated]{.mark}**
[against]{.mark} an [**assessment** of **America's**]{.mark} own
[**ability** to]{.mark} **continue [lead]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing [the
**resistance** to a **s**pheres-**o**f-**i**nfluence
**world**.]{.underline} Averting that outcome is becoming steadily
harder, as the relative power and ambition of America's authoritarian
rivals rise and U.S. leadership seems to falter.

[The legal challenges that [hybrid threats]{.mark} present]{.underline}
for collective security guarantees [[have been **recognized** at the
**highest**]{.mark} **political [level]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At their
Warsaw summit held in July 2016, NATO's member states confirmed their
readiness to assist each other at any stage of a hybrid campaign and to
counter hybrid warfare as part of collective defense.294 They also
underscored that the North Atlantic Council "could decide to invoke
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty."295 They repeated these points at
their Brussels summit in July 2018.296 By drawing an express link
between hybrid warfare and collective defense, [NATO leaders
signaled]{.underline} their [**resolve** not to allow Article 5 to be
hollowed out]{.underline}.297 Still, their declarations of intent strike
a rather conservative note. Whilst they accept that NATO may assist an
Ally at any stage of a "hybrid campaign," it is only in cases of "hybrid
warfare" that they foresee a potential role for Article 5. This is not
an unreasonable position to take. As we saw earlier, recourse to the use
of force to counter hybrid threats falling below the threshold of an
armed attack is neither permissible nor necessarily appropriate. A
pledge to invoke the mutual defense commitment in response to every type
of hybrid threat would be a promise to use the proverbial sledgehammer
to crack a nut. It would be unrealistic and therefore lack credibility
in the eyes of hybrid adversaries.298 [[By accepting that]{.mark} the
role of [Article 5 is **confined**]{.mark} to situations of hybrid
warfare, the Warsaw and Brussels Summit [Declarations
**avoid**]{.mark}]{.underline} such **[[empty]{.mark}
gestures]{.underline}**. However, in the same breath they also concede
that [the application of Article 5 is **contingent** on the **legal
[threshold]{.mark}**]{.underline} between warfare and peace, and thus
vulnerable to subversion along the lines discussed in the preceding
sections.

It may be tempting to deal with the problem of legal thresholds by
attempting to escape them altogether, but this is not a feasible
strategy. **[[Even if]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the]{.underline}
contracting [[parties]{.mark} were to **[revise Article
5]{.mark}**]{.underline} NAT and Article 42(7) TEU to avoid references
to "armed attack" and "armed aggression,"299 [[they]{.mark} would
**[remain bound]{.mark}** by the [rules governing]{.mark} the use of
[force]{.mark} under the UN Charter]{.underline} and customary
international law. [[Although]{.underline}]{.mark} the member states of
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the EU [[make up]{.mark} an [influential
part]{.mark} of the international community, [it is **not
within**]{.mark} **their [ability]{.mark}** [to adjust]{.mark} these
general [rules]{.mark} of international law
**[unilaterally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In any event, lowering the
threshold for the use of force in order to facilitate the application of
Article 5 and Article 42(7) would come with significant costs, since it
would loosen the legal restrictions for all states, including hostile
powers. [The applicable [thresholds]{.mark} therefore **[cannot
be]{.mark} unilaterally [modified]{.mark}**]{.underline} at will and
without the risk of unraveling key elements of the international legal
order as it currently stands.

A more promising approach is to strengthen legal interoperability among
NATO and EU nations. One line of effort is to reduce legal gray
zones,300 for example by narrowing disagreements over the gap that lies
between the definition of force and armed attack. This could prepare the
ground for developing a shared understanding of what kind of hybrid
threats may trigger the applicability of Article 5 NAT and Article 42(7)
TEU. Given that the assessment of any security threat depends heavily on
its context, it may prove somewhat sterile to build such a consensus in
the abstract. Drawing on war-gaming and exercises may offer a more
fruitful way forward. Bearing in mind how attractive the use of proxies
is to a hybrid state adversary,301 developing a common approach to
attribute their activities to the sponsoring state also merits
attention. Although many aspects of the rules governing the attribution
of wrongful acts are settled, certain questions could benefit from a
joint posture.302 NATO and EU nations should also strengthen their
collective mechanisms for unmasking attempts at plausible deniability in
order to deny its use as a hybrid instrument,303 as illustrated by their
united response to the Skripal incident and to Russian cyber
operations.304

C. Obsolescence of global rules and institutions Although the previous
argument primarily rests on the broad pattern of international trade and
finance, **[the adverse [effects]{.mark}]{.underline}** of external
liberalisation [[can be compounded by]{.mark} **inadequate
[governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As far as trade is concerned, two
cases in point are, first, inertia in the categorisation of countries,
especially the fact that emerging countries, including China, still
enjoy developing country status in the WTO; and, second, failures to
enforce the adequate protection of intellectual property (an issue on
which the EU recently joined the US and filed a complaint at the WTO
against Chinese practices; see European Union, 2018). These grievances,
and others concerning subsidies or investment, are not new: they were
clearly spelled out by policymakers from the Obama administration (see
for example, Schwab, 2011, and Wu, 2016). The underlying concern is that
the systemic convergence on a market economy template that was expected
from participation in the WTO has failed to materialise. The rules and
institutions of global trade have brought shallow convergence but not
the deeper alignment of economic systems that was hoped for. More
generally, [**existing rules and institutions** were conceived for a
different world]{.underline}. This is very apparent in the trade field:
the GATT/WTO framework dates from what Baldwin (2016) has called the
"first unbundling" of production and consumption. They were not designed
for the "second unbundling" of knowledge and production that gave rise
to the emergence of global value chains. For decades, the implicit
assumption behind the structure of trade negotiations has been that
nations have well-defined sectoral trade interests: they are either
exporters or importers. But in a world of global value chains, they are
both importers and exporters of similar products simultaneously. [Even
if **the principles of multilateralism** remain valid, **important
features of the [rules]{.mark} and institutions** in which they are
embedded [are]{.mark} **increasingly [outdated]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In the same way, opening to capital movements was supposed to result in
net financial flows from savings-rich to savings-poor countries. What
has happened instead is a massive increase in gross flows resulting in
the interpenetration of financial systems and the coexistence of
sizeable external assets and liabilities. The consequence has been the
emergence of a global financial cycle (see for example Rey, 2017) and of
policy dilemmas that are quite different from those arising in a simple
Mundell-Fleming framework, in which interdependence takes place through
net inflows and outflows of capital. [Developments in the climate
field]{.underline} further [illustrate the point]{.underline}. The 1997
Kyoto Protocol was negotiated under the assumption that the bulk of
greenhouse gas emissions would continue to originate in the advanced
countries. But by the time the Protocol was meant to enter into force,
it was clear already that the hypothesis was deeply wrong. The exemption
of developing countries from emissions reductions was one of the reasons
why the US did not ratify the treaty. The failed Copenhagen agreement of
2009 was an attempt to replicate Kyoto on a global scale, but [[there
was **no consensus**]{.mark} for such an approach. Rules can be
[reform]{.mark}ed and institutions can adapt. But this [is **a
long**]{.mark} **and [demanding process]{.mark}**, especially when [it
requires **unanimity**, when]{.mark} participating [countries have
**diverging interests** and]{.mark} when changes [require
**ratification**]{.mark} **by parliaments** [where there is no
majority]{.mark} to support them. Global [rules]{.mark}]{.underline}
therefore [[exhibit]{.mark} **a strong [inertia]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[prevents]{.mark} **necessary
[adaptations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Trade rules, amendments to which
require unanimity, are a case in point. Institutions are nimbler and can
adapt to changing priorities or perspectives on interdependence. The IMF
for example has succeeded in adjusting to major changes in the
international economic regime and major shifts in the intellectual
consensus. But even institutions face limitations to their ability to
keep up with underlying transformations. This is one of the reasons why
solutions to emerging problems have often been looked for outside the
existing multilateral, institution-based governance framework (Table 1).
D. The imbalances of global governance [A further reason
for]{.underline} popular [dissatisfaction]{.underline} with global
governance [is **its unbalanced nature**. The deeper international
integration becomes, the broader the scope of policy]{.underline} its
management [should cover]{.underline}, and the more acute the tension
between the technical requirements of global interdependence and the
domestically-rooted legitimacy of public policies. This is most apparent
in the field of taxation. International tax optimisation by
multinationals has become an issue of significant relevance and it is
estimated that 40 percent of their profit is being artificially shifted
to low-tax countries -- with major consequences for national budgets
(Tørsløv et al, 2018). But the fact that taxation remains at the core of
sovereign prerogatives limits the scope and ambition of initiatives
conducted at international level. The result, which can be regarded as
an illustration of Rodrik's trilemma, is that global coordination in tax
matters falls short of what equity-conscious citizens regard as
desirable and, at the same time, exceeds what sovereignty-conscious
citizens consider acceptable. [The imbalances of global governance are
by no means limited to]{.underline} the [taxation]{.underline} field.
[The same can be found in **a series of domains**, for example
biodiversity and the preservation of nature]{.underline}. E. Increased
complexity [**The final obstacle to multilateral solutions** has to do
with **the sheer complexity** of the challenges]{.underline} global
governance has [to tackle]{.underline}. In recent decades channels of
international interdependence have both multiplied and diversified. They
now link together countries with significantly differing levels of
technical, economic or financial development. Because they have
developed outside the scope of negotiated rules and established
institutions, some of **[channels of
[interdependence]{.mark}]{.underline}** also [[escape]{.mark} **the
reach of international [agreements]{.mark}** [to **an unprecedented
degree**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is especially, but not only, the
case of the internet and the multiple networks that rely on it. The
world does not fit anymore the usual representation whereby individual
nations trade goods, capital and technology. [**Even [putting

### AT: Miscalc/Lashout\-\--1NC

#### Ambiguity gives [operational flex]{.underline} in crises -- prevents [underreactions]{.underline} and solves [adversary restraint]{.underline}

**Roggeveen 17** -- Barbara Roggeveen research assistant at the Slavic
Department of the University of Amsterdam, "NATO Needs an Offensive
Cybersecurity Policy," 8/8/17,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/nato-needs-an-offensive-cybersecurity-policy/

Although NATO has been working toward a more comprehensive cybersecurity
policy, there are two major challenges with its current strategy.
[[The]{.mark} current [plan places cyberattacks within]{.mark} the scope
of [Article 5]{.mark} of the North Atlantic Treaty [and]{.mark} the
concept of [collective defense]{.mark}, thus, [creating **high
thresholds for engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, [[it
allows for]{.mark} mainly [**defensive** and **reactive
measures**,]{.mark} leaving [less]{.mark} room [for]{.mark} preventive
or]{.underline} **[[offensive operations]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

NATO's approach to cybersecurity can be traced back to early steps taken
at the 2014 Wales Summit, in which NATO included cyber defense in its
core tasks of collective defense. At the Warsaw Summit two years later,
NATO recognized cyberspace as a "domain of operations," reaffirming its
defensive mandate with regard to cyber threats.

The Warsaw Summit Communiqué states that recognizing cyberspace as a
domain of operations will "support NATO's broader deterrence \[of\] and
defense \[against cyber threats\]," and NATO promised to continue
integrating cyber defense "into operational planning \[to ensure\] a
better management of resources, skills, and capabilities."

Armed attack-threshold

The designation of cyberspace as a domain of operations has far-reaching
implications. As decided upon by Allied countries in the Tallinn Manual
2.0, [[such]{.mark} a label [allows NATO to act only against]{.mark}
those [cyberattacks that qualify as]{.mark} an **"[armed
attack]{.mark}**."]{.underline} In the case of cyberattacks, however,
[[opponents]{.mark} often [do not seek]{.mark} physical
[destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline} Of late, [[cyberattacks have
moved]{.mark} further away from traditional warfare [in pursuit of
**subtler influences**]{.mark}]{.underline} , sometimes involving
coercive political pressure. On July 28, the US Congress voted for new
sanctions on Russia for its meddling in the 2016 US presidential
election in favor of then-candidate US President Donald J. Trump.

[By [placing cyberattacks within]{.mark} the doctrine of [**collective
defense**, NATO limits its response to]{.mark} those cyberattacks that
reach [the **armed-attack threshold**, making it]{.mark} **[extremely
difficult]{.mark}** for NATO members [to]{.mark} effectively [address
cyberattacks]{.mark} that do not qualify as such]{.underline}.

Whether a cyber operation constitutes an "armed attack" also depends on
the parties involved. Traditionally, the right to collective defense
could only be invoked in case of an armed attack undertaken by one state
against another. NATO's Strategic Concept allowed for a wider
definition, stipulating that "the North Atlantic Treaty covers any armed
attack on the territory of the Allies, from whatever direction or
source." Although this allows NATO to take defensive action against
cyberattacks carried out by non-state actors, [there is still some
uncertainty within the community of allied countries as to when
collective defense against non-state actors is permissible. One of the
biggest challenges in this case remains attribution]{.underline}. It is
often difficult to trace cyberattacks back to one specific organization.

From defensive to offensive capabilities

Currently, [[NATO's]{.mark} cybersecurity [strategy is]{.mark}
**strictly [defensive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The NATO Computer Incident
Response Capability (NCIRC) protects NATO's own networks, and NATO
supports allied members in their individual cyber defenses through
intelligence gathering and sharing, the employment of high-readiness
cyber defense teams, the development of targets for allied countries to
facilitate national cyber defense capabilities, and investment in
education, training, and exercise.

As James A. Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote for the Tallinn
Papers, a series of publications from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence, "[a cyber defensive orientation is [the equivalent
of]{.mark} a **static defense**]{.underline}, defending fixed positions
rather than maneuvering, and **[[conceding initiative to
opponents]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

[Defensive measures]{.underline} might hold off an individual
cyberattack, but they [do not address the underlying
threat]{.underline}. Although the protection of NATO members' national
networks should be a priority, [[the most effective way]{.mark} to
provide sustainable and long-term protection against cyberattacks
[is]{.mark} through **[offensive capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
the destruction of opponent networks and systems.

While individual member states can take certain steps toward achieving
this objective---the United States, for example, has already employed
strong offensive cyber capabilities, such as Stuxnet---[a collective
NATO doctrine would provide allied countries with the necessary
guidelines regarding proportionality and subsidiarity when employing
offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}. NATO's cybersecurity policy
should provide a clear framework to address the relatively uncharted
territory of offensive cyber operations.

Recommendations

Current developments in the field of cybersecurity require a more
proactive approach. In order to counter cyber threats, [NATO should
pursue a broader and **more dynamic** operational framework than that of
**collective defense**]{.underline}. As the cyber capabilities of NATO's
opponents grow more sophisticated, the Alliance should adopt a
cybersecurity policy that can effectively counter these threats.

## Strategic Ambiguity Good

### 1nc - turn

#### Squo solves -- locks in strategic ambiguity which is [essential]{.underline} to deterrence -- motivates adversaries' [self-restraint]{.underline} - [non-article 5]{.underline} responses solve their offense

Michaela **Prucková 22** - Masaryk University/NATO CCDCOE Law Branch.
("Cyber attacks and Article 5 -- a note on a blurry but consistent
position of NATO," CCDCOE, 2022,

) PJW

In reporting on the unfolding events in Ukraine, media and social
[platforms]{.underline} have [repeatedly discussed]{.underline} as novel
the [possibility of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty being
triggered by a cyber attack]{.underline} on one or more Member States.
This article presents a brief overview of the topic and explains that
the possibility a cyber attack could lead to the invocation of Article 5
has been established since 2014; hence it is not a novelty and
definitely not a response to the latest events on NATO's eastern flank.

NATO's cornerstone

Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, NATO's founding document,
stipulates that:

'The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
and consequently, they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each
of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective
self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United
Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such
action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall
immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be
terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to
restore and maintain international peace and security.'

As one of the core provisions of the Alliance, Article 5 confirms
solidarity amongst Member States (Allies) in the event of an armed
attack, which can be summarised as one for all, all for one in the
spirit of Alexandre Dumas's musketeers. [[Collective
defence]{.underline}]{.mark} does not involve merely using armed forces
and sending military units; rather, it [[binds Allies to]{.mark} provide
**[possible]{.mark}** and appropriate [help]{.mark} to the affected
Party.]{.underline}

In NATO's history, Article 5 has been invoked only once, after the 9/11
terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. That decision, first,
showed solidarity with the US after the attacks and, second, enabled the
country and the Alliance to take further steps in responding to them.

It is therefore clear that invocation of Article 5 is not an everyday
measure but a major political decision on which all 30 Allies have to
agree.

Article 5 in connection with cyberspace

The cyber agenda is not new to the Alliance's portfolio; the first
reference to cyber attacks appeared in the Prague Summit Declaration of
2002 (Para. 4). This type of public document reflects the outcomes of
debates and decisions made at the highest political level of NATO Member
States.

Since 2002, the cyber agenda started to increasingly appear in
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}'s documents until [2014]{.underline} when
the [Wales Summit]{.underline} Declaration [[acknowledged]{.mark} for
the first time the [possibility of cyber attacks triggering Article
5]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, the relevant [section]{.underline}
(Para. 72) [focuses on the potential attack's effects and
magnitude]{.underline}; it does not question a cyber attack's ability to
invoke Article 5 and is couched in terms of when, not if. In 2014, no
one denied that operations in cyberspace could be equal in impact to
conventional attacks.

[At the next NATO summit in 2016, the Allies]{.underline} went even
further by [declaring cyberspace a new operational domain]{.underline},
taking its place alongside air, land and sea (Para. 70). The Warsaw
Summit Communiqué thus reaffirmed cyberspace as part of NATO's core task
of collective defence, following the proclamation of 2014. [The
possibility of the invocation of Article 5 in reaction to a cyber attack
was reiterated in 2021]{.underline} in Para. 33 of Brussels Summit
Communiqué. **[On all those occasions, [evaluation on a case-by-case
basis was the guiding principle.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The same applies to space and hybrid warfare. Space was declared the
fifth domain of operations during the foreign ministers' meeting in 2019
in the London Summit Declaration (Para. 6). The affirmation that attacks
to, from or within space may invoke Article 5 was also reaffirmed two
years later in the Brussels Summit Communiqué (Para. 33). As for hybrid
warfare, the statements that it may invoke Article 5 have appeared, for
example, in Para. 72 of Warsaw Summit Communiqué (2016) or Para. 31 of
Brussels Summit Communiqué (2021).

A game-changing cyber attack

We need to keep in mind that cyber attacks have been a 'persistent
challenge' for years to NATO, with Russia being a stable originator of
limited cyber activities, avoiding further escalation until now.
[[None]{.mark} of the cyber incidents Allies has thus far experienced
has led to the invocation of Article 5 and neither has the Alliance
[stated openly what]{.mark} level or [damage the triggering attack would
have to cause]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Even [though this possibility is]{.mark} sometimes [criticised for
being]{.mark} a [vague]{.mark} statement without clearly drawn lines,
**[it is]{.mark} also [logical]{.mark}.** As NATO Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg has stated, both the extent of such an attack and the Allied
response under [Article 5 '**must remain purposefully
vague**]{.mark}'.]{.underline} Hence, [the Alliance does not provide
potential adversaries with knowledge of the threshold between an
everyday cyber attack]{.underline} (see, for example, the live map of
ongoing attacks by FireEye) [and an armed attack in cyberspace. This
**[uncertainty serves as a deterrent]{.mark}** and can [motivate]{.mark}
a potential [adversary to exercise self-restraint]{.mark} in their
malicious cyber activities and avoid launching a large-scale attack that
could cross the blurred threshold.]{.underline} Such a position of
strategic ambiguity is reflected in the documents which discuss
evaluation on a case-by-case basis.

Put simply, [**[NATO does not want to weaken its position by
revealing]{.mark} its [red lines]{.mark}** and reaction measures in
cyberspace.]{.underline} However, we are not entirely blind here. The
Alliance has acknowledged, for example, that cyber attacks similar to
the ones Estonia experienced in 2007 could lead to Article 5 invocation
today.

Since the required gravity and impact of a game-changing cyber attack
remain unclear, discussions emerge stirred by the events in Ukraine on
what Russian actions in cyberspace aimed at NATO could or would lead to
the invocation of Article 5. For example, Michael Schmitt provides an
analysis of potential scenarios of Russia's cyber operations and their
interpretation under international law, not limiting the scope of events
only to armed attack.

To summarise, responses to cyber attacks, attacks to, from or within
space, and hybrid warfare are part of NATO's collective defence and can,
under certain circumstances, lead to invoking Article 5 of the North
Atlantic Treaty. Both [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} and hybrid
[[activities can be met with]{.mark} a range of proportional
[responses]{.mark} by NATO Member States, which can
coordinate]{.underline}, for example, economic or diplomatic measures
**[[without having to invoke Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This was
stated in Para. 31 of the Brussels Summit Communiqué and by the
Secretary-General himself during Cyber Defence Pledge Conference in
2018.

Threats of cyber attacks have featured in NATO policies since 2014. This
understanding has developed as a natural response to the evolution of
the threat landscape and is not a novelty of the events in Ukraine or an
artificial tool aimed at increasing the current geopolitical tensions.

**[purposefully vague]{.mark}**]{.underline}.207 Why? [Strategic
**[ambiguity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[has]{.mark} its
[benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the Atlantic Council panel,
[[there is no "**redline**]{.mark}" or "**determined threshold**" that
would **automatically define**]{.underline} [a cyber act as an act of
war]{.underline}.208 [[Leaving]{.mark} the rules]{.underline}
**[undefined]{.underline}** [affords [NATO **ample
room**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in which [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[operate]{.underline}**]{.mark}. For a 28-member multinational
organization that operates on the principle of consensus, [[**time** and
**latitude**]{.mark} for solidifying strategic-level decisions
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**critical**. If NATO
**publicized**]{.underline}]{.mark} [a cyber]{.underline} [[**redline**,
it would]{.underline} [**box the Alliance into a corner**.
This]{.underline}]{.mark} [kind of policy could]{.underline}
**[[embolden]{.mark} cyber [offenders]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and
provoke]{.mark} **[massive intrusions]{.mark}** that target NATO's
networks at]{.underline} **[[just below this
threshold]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Having a **defined
redline**]{.underline} [could [also invite]{.mark} **nefarious cyber
[actors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to **cross**]{.underline} [it to
**test**]{.underline}]{.mark} [NATO's [resolve, **damage its
reputation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [as a leader in Euro-Atlantic
security, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[undermine]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} **[credibility]{.underline}** [of its]{.underline}
**[[Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark}** [commitments.]{.underline}

Following the Wales Summit in 2014, [NATO affirmed its stance on law and
cyberspace]{.underline} while refusing to address cyber redlines:

Our [policy]{.underline} also [recognizes that international
law]{.underline}, including international humanitarian law and the UN
Charter, [applies in cyberspace. Cyber attacks can reach a]{.underline}
**[threshold]{.underline}** [that **threatens**]{.underline} [national
and Euro-Atlantic **prosperity**, **security**, and
**stability**]{.underline}. Their impact could be as harmful to modern
societies as a conventional attack. We affirm, therefore, that [cyber
defense is part of NATO's]{.underline} **[core task]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} [**collective defense**. A decision as to when a cyber
attack would lead to the]{.underline} [**[invocation]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[Article 5]{.underline}** [would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} [taken by the **N**orth **A**tlantic **C**ouncil
on a **[case-by-case]{.mark} basis**]{.underline}.209

However, an [invocation of [Article 5 does]{.mark} not necessarily
[mean]{.mark} that a NATO response would **include [force]{.mark}**.
Article 5]{.underline} of the Washington Treaty [states]{.underline} the
following:

The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
and consequently they agree that, [if such an]{.underline} [**armed
attack** occurs, each of them]{.underline}, in exercise of the right of
individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the
Charter of the United Nations, [will assist the Party or Parties so
attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other
Parties, such action **as it deems necessary**, including the use of
armed force, to]{.underline} **[restore]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[maintain]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**
[of the North Atlantic area]{.underline}.210

Thus, [as long as each Alliance member takes "such action as it deems
necessary," it cannot be found in violation of the collective defense
principle.]{.underline}211 [In the case of a]{.underline} **[major
act]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[cyberwar]{.underline}** [against
one of its members, [NATO could invoke Article 5 as
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[show of solidarity]{.underline}** [but opt
to]{.underline} **[refrain]{.underline}** [from]{.underline}]{.mark}
[employing **[kinetic]{.mark} military [force]{.mark}**]{.underline};
instead, [[the Alliance could use]{.mark} **purely [cybernetic
means]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or a **hybrid alternative**]{.underline}
that combined cybernetic tools with military force to fulfill its
objectives.

In all, [[NATO's]{.mark} **establishment**, **organization**, and
**employment** of its sophisticated cyber [response
agencies]{.mark}]{.underline} and IT resources like the NCIRC, NCIO,
NCIA, and RRT [[are indicative of how]{.underline}
**[serious]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ly]{.underline}** [[the Alliance has
implemented]{.mark} its **cyber [defense]{.mark} policies**]{.underline}
[[at the]{.underline} **[operational level]{.underline}**]{.mark}[.

**[p]{.mark}**rocedure[**s**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[ambiguous

the Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[highly prepared]{.mark} to respond
effectively]{.underline}** [to major acts of cyber
aggression]{.underline} against one or more of its members. [If an act
of cyberwar **met the threshold**]{.underline} [of an]{.underline}
[**armed attack**, NATO would]{.underline} probably [be prepared [to
**manage**, **counter**, and **resolve** the issue]{.mark}]{.underline}
in cyberspace; still, one cannot exclude the possible need to take
kinetic measures. Out of a numerical ranking of 1--3, the Alliance
earned a preparedness score of 3 in cyber strategy.

At the same time, [NATO should aim to deter specific types of
particularly threatening unconventional activities]{.underline}. These
include major and sophisticated cyber attacks against allies' military
forces and critical military and civilian infrastructure, proxy military
and special forces operations, and state-sponsored terrorism. NATO could
declare that such activities may lead it to invoke Article 5 and respond
in various ways, including asymmetrically (for example, the response to
a cyber attack may not involve only cyber capabilities).

The alliance must be able to identify early whether and when
unconventional and hybrid gray-zone actions have become a more
substantial and coordinated campaign. In such a case, NATO should aim to
deter the adversary from escalating further. This requires increasing
the alliance's capacity to share early-warning intelligence and pool
national intelligence-gathering, investigation, and attribution
capabilities. NATO should not shy away from attributing ongoing
operations to state adversaries, relying on national data as needed. The
alliance and its members should be prepared to use direct channels of
communication and other means to deliver immediate deterrence signaling
in specific cases.

#### Identifying cyber as an Article V issue creates [arbitrary thresholds]{.underline} for armed attacks which can be exploited by adversaries -- maintaining [strategic ambiguity]{.underline} along with developing offensive capabilities is key to deterrence -- turns the case

**Roggeveen 17** -- Barbara Roggeveen research assistant at the Slavic
Department of the University of Amsterdam, "NATO Needs an Offensive
Cybersecurity Policy," 8/8/17,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/nato-needs-an-offensive-cybersecurity-policy/

Although NATO has been working toward a more comprehensive cybersecurity
policy, there are two major challenges with its current strategy.
[[The]{.mark} current [plan places cyberattacks within]{.mark} the scope
of [Article 5]{.mark} of the North Atlantic Treaty [and]{.mark} the

or]{.underline} **[[offensive operations]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

NATO's approach to cybersecurity can be traced back to early steps taken
at the 2014 Wales Summit, in which NATO included cyber defense in its
core tasks of collective defense. At the Warsaw Summit two years later,
NATO recognized cyberspace as a "domain of operations," reaffirming its
defensive mandate with regard to cyber threats.

The Warsaw Summit Communiqué states that recognizing cyberspace as a

integrating cyber defense "into operational planning \[to ensure\] a

The designation of cyberspace as a domain of operations has far-reaching

attack]{.mark}**."]{.underline} In the case of cyberattacks, however,
[[opponents]{.mark} often [do not seek]{.mark} physical
[destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline} Of late, [[cyberattacks have
moved]{.mark} further away from traditional warfare [in pursuit of
**subtler influences**]{.mark}]{.underline}, sometimes involving
coercive political pressure. On July 28, the US Congress voted for new
sanctions on Russia for its meddling in the 2016 US presidential
election in favor of then-candidate US President Donald J. Trump.

[By [placing cyberattacks within]{.mark} the doctrine of [**collective
defense**, NATO limits its response to]{.mark} those cyberattacks that
reach [the **armed-attack threshold**, making it]{.mark} **[extremely
difficult]{.mark}** for NATO members [to]{.mark} effectively [address
cyberattacks]{.mark} that do not qualify as such]{.underline}.

Whether a cyber operation constitutes an "armed attack" also depends on
the parties involved. Traditionally, the right to collective defense
could only be invoked in case of an armed attack undertaken by one state
against another. NATO's Strategic Concept allowed for a wider
definition, stipulating that "the North Atlantic Treaty covers any armed
attack on the territory of the Allies, from whatever direction or
source." Although this allows NATO to take defensive action against
cyberattacks carried out by non-state actors, [there is still some
uncertainty within the community of allied countries as to when
collective defense against non-state actors is permissible. One of the
biggest challenges in this case remains attribution]{.underline}. It is
often difficult to trace cyberattacks back to one specific organization.

From defensive to offensive capabilities

Currently, [[NATO's]{.mark} cybersecurity [strategy is]{.mark}
**strictly [defensive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The NATO Computer Incident
Response Capability (NCIRC) protects NATO's own networks, and NATO
supports allied members in their individual cyber defenses through
intelligence gathering and sharing, the employment of high-readiness
cyber defense teams, the development of targets for allied countries to
facilitate national cyber defense capabilities, and investment in
education, training, and exercise.

As James A. Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote for the Tallinn
Papers, a series of publications from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence, "[a cyber defensive orientation is [the equivalent
of]{.mark} a **static defense**]{.underline}, defending fixed positions
rather than maneuvering, and **[[conceding initiative to
opponents]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

[Defensive measures]{.underline} might hold off an individual
cyberattack, but they [do not address the underlying
threat]{.underline}. Although the protection of NATO members' national
networks should be a priority, [[the most effective way]{.mark} to
provide sustainable and long-term protection against cyberattacks
[is]{.mark} through **[offensive capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
the destruction of opponent networks and systems.

While individual member states can take certain steps toward achieving
this objective---the United States, for example, has already employed
strong offensive cyber capabilities, such as Stuxnet---[a collective
NATO doctrine would provide allied countries with the necessary
guidelines regarding proportionality and subsidiarity when employing
offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}. NATO's cybersecurity policy
should provide a clear framework to address the relatively uncharted
territory of offensive cyber operations.

Recommendations

Current developments in the field of cybersecurity require a more
proactive approach. In order to counter cyber threats, [NATO should
pursue a broader and **more dynamic** operational framework than that of
**collective defense**]{.underline}. As the cyber capabilities of NATO's
opponents grow more sophisticated, the Alliance should adopt a
cybersecurity policy that can effectively counter these threats.

#### Lack of consensus [turns the case]{.underline} -- conflicting standards produce [unclear thresholds]{.underline} that undercut deterrence. 

**Tertrais '16** \[Bruno; Deputy Director of the Foundation for
Strategic Research, member of the committees of White Papers on Defence
and National Security, former Special Assistant to the Director of
Strategic Affairs at the Ministry of Defense; April 2016; "Article 5 of
the Washington Treaty: Its Origins, Meaning and Future";
<http://www.jstor.com/stable/resrep10238>; NATO Defense College, No.
130\] \*Edited in brackets for reading clarity.

The Alliance has made progress in deterring and protecting against such
threats. Protecting against a limited ballistic strike from the Middle
East was the rationale for NATO's ballistic missile defense program. It
is today an operational capability. [The cyber threat is]{.underline}
now [recognized as having the potential to be considered, under some
circumstances, an "armed attack."]{.underline}16 But [faced with a
limited attack, [NATO should not expect]{.mark} that [Article 5 will
be]{.mark} **automatically**, [**swiftly** and **unanimously
declared**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and the history of the past 25 years
highlights the relevance of these doubts). [[If coming from
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, it should be expected that
[**[several]{.mark} member [states will hesitate]{.mark}** before taking
steps that may commit them to war]{.underline} with Moscow. [This
includes not only a "Northern contingency" (in the Baltic
region]{.underline} or in the High North), [but also]{.underline} a
scenario where Russia forcefully responds on [Turkish
territory]{.underline} to what it would, rightly or wrongly, see as
provocation by Ankara.

Attribution will be a problem in many instances; even assuming that this
issue is solved, some member countries might hesitate in acknowledging
the adversary's responsibility, especially if the latter -- as should be
expected -- embarks on massive propaganda aimed at influencing their
public opinions.

Finally, [[a **30 plus-country alliance**]{.mark}]{.underline} (if two
or more countries joined) [[would be less likely to **reach
consensus**]{.mark} on]{.underline} the urgency to declare [Article 5
faced with a **limited attack** than it would have been when NATO
included only half that number]{.underline} (which was the case during
most of the Cold War). As a result, "[[what might count **locally**
a]{.mark}s an **[intolerable assault]{.mark}** on the Baltic
States']{.underline} sovereignty [[may not be seen in Brussels as an
'**armed attack'**]{.mark} for Article 5 purposes.]{.underline} \[\...\]
[[All the strength]{.mark} of the world's mightiest]{.underline}
military [alliance [will not amount to much if]{.mark} its [members
**cannot agree**]{.mark}]{.underline} when an aggressor has actually
stepped over the line."17

[NATO should expect that its]{.underline} potential [aggressors are
**smart**.]{.underline} Having learned from the history of warfare and
terrorism, [an adversary could organize fake civilian accidents, launch
false flag operations, embark on sabotage, commit]{.underline} acts of
[terrorism, abduct foreign citizens,]{.underline} claim a "right of hot
pursuit" on Alliance territory under a false pretext,
[etc.]{.underline}18

[Incursions of security forces]{.underline} and militia (so-called
"little green men") -- a subset of [what Russia calls "[hybrid
warfare]{.mark}" -- [are the **hardest to deter** and **defend**]{.mark}
against]{.underline}. Northern European security analysts are right to
ask the following question: "[to what extent is NATO's legal framework
ready to deal with modern warfare?]{.underline} \[\...\] Supposing a
Crimea-like situation occurs in Narva, Estonia, for example. [**[Can
Article 5 be called on]{.mark}** if there is no armed attack, but
instead]{.underline}, what Russia would call [a 'democratic right of
self-determination]{.underline} of the same nature as Kosovo and
Crimea'?"19 It would be impossible to declare that any form of
externally-induced political destabilization is an "armed attack." A
positive answer to the question asked would be impossible to reach
unanimously and would stretch the definition of an "armed attack" to the
implausible.

[Legal [history provides a useful guide]{.mark} to what an **armed
attack** is in **international law**. [The]{.mark}]{.underline}
International Court of Justice ([[ICJ]{.underline}]{.mark}), in its
seminal Nicaragua decision (1986), [[stated that it includes]{.mark}
"the sending of or on behalf of a State of [armed]{.mark}]{.underline}
bands, [[groups]{.underline}]{.mark}, irregular or mercenaries"
[[provided]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[said State has "**effective"
control \[over\]** them]{.underline}]{.mark}. The International Criminal
Tribunal for Yugoslavia, for its part, judges that "overall" control is
sufficient.

#### And, the aff produces reluctance to invoke Article V [early]{.underline} in a crisis. That "wait-and-see" posture complicates crisis escalation management [later]{.underline}.

[[The first exercise was conducted in]{.underline}]{.mark} fall of
[2016]{.underline}, in support of U.S. SOCEUR, [and involved 29 expert

suspicious Russia-linked incidents against [Latvia]{.mark}: a
cyberattack]{.underline} against the energy grid, [an explosion in
a]{.underline} Russian-language [middle school, and staged
protests]{.underline} in Riga. As Baltic, American, and Western European
experts addressed these crises, several important findings emerged. The
first was that [[both Latvia and]{.mark} its neighbour]{.underline}
[[Lithuania **delayed asking for Western assistance** as long as
possible]{.mark} -- U.S. and/or [NATO assistance]{.mark}]{.underline} in
handling Russian interference [[was]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[seen
as the **ultimate trump card**]{.mark} to be called upon [only at the
**darkest hour**]{.mark} (which any individual grey zone crisis hardly
qualified as]{.underline}, though their cumulative impact was
approaching the threshold). [The problem was that [it **significantly
complicated escalation management**, depriving]{.mark} allied
[decision-makers of]{.mark}]{.underline} a series of [[tools that
could]{.underline}]{.mark} help [**de[-escalate the conflict]{.mark}**
[early and giving rise to]{.mark} more [possibilities for the adversary
to **sow discord**]{.mark} and **ambiguity** [among]{.mark} the
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The second important insight was that the
EU played a significantly more important role than NATO in managing the
grey zone crises -- [turning to NATO resources was seen as too
escalatory]{.underline} a step. The third significant insight was that
although the experts agreed at the outset on the importance for NATO and
the EU to maintain a united front, during any particular crisis there
was a tendency to conduct [[bilateral talks]{.mark} with
Russia]{.underline}, trying to resolve the situation without involving
the target state (i.e. Latvia) directly -- which [[**inevitably
backfired**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### at: ambiguity dangerous

#### Even if they win ambiguity is dangerous, it is [on balance beneficial]{.underline} -- alternatives collapse deterrence by allowing adversaries to operate under critical thresholds

Cyber Age: Strengthening Security & Defence, Stabilising Deterrence,"

60\. [[NATO maintains a cyber]{.mark} deterrence [policy of
**ambiguity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, [it does not draw a clear
line for when a cyber attack is sufficiently harmful to cross the
threshold to an armed attack.]{.underline} Second, [it does not
currently have an operational definition of what the collective response
would be if that threshold were to be crossed. [Such]{.mark} a cyber
deterrence policy **[offers]{.mark} several
[advantages]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but also poses distinct challenges.

61\. A certain degree of [**ambiguity is beneficial** because [it could
make opponents wary of going too far]{.mark} in their cyber attacks.
[The opponent]{.mark} always **[fears]{.mark} stepping over [the
invisible line]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and thus prefers treading
lightly. A [similarly vague deterrence]{.underline} posture arguably
**[worked well during the Cold War]{.underline}**. However, ambiguity on
where the threshold lies could indeed lead an opponent who is
sufficiently comfortably with taking risks, to continuously exploit the
'grey zones', test the defender's resolve, and conduct ever more daring
cyber attacks.

62\. [[If the Alliance]{.mark} were to [set a clear threshold, the
opponent would]{.mark} better understand how to [**stay below that
threshold**. This would]{.mark}]{.underline} strengthen deterrence of
threats above the threshold but would [encourage the opponent to
**[increase attacks]{.mark}** just below the threshold]{.underline}.
Arguably, the solution for such attacks cannot be found in deterrence,
but rather in clearly defined policy response for hybrid operations.
Despite its best efforts, the Alliance continues to struggle to develop
such options. [Setting [specific thresholds without]{.mark} strong
[options for hybrid operations would]{.mark} **only [encourage
more]{.mark} of them**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[the Allies
could]{.mark} also [find it hard to]{.mark} agree on and]{.underline}
perhaps also [[**credibly commit** to]{.mark} a specific
[threshold]{.mark}. Thus, on balance, **the policy of [ambiguity]{.mark}
on thresholds [makes sense]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

63\. [[NATO]{.mark}'s ambiguity]{.underline} also [extends to the type
of punishment it threatens]{.underline} were it to suffer a cyber
attack. The Alliance has made clear that it neither limits punishment to
similar cyber attacks nor excludes them. Instead, [it [keeps the option
open to use]{.mark} the full range of Allied [capabilities]{.mark} to
deter and counter cyber attacks]{.underline}. Once again, **[[this
introduces useful doubt]{.underline}]{.mark}** in an opponent's mind.
While NATO would retaliate in a proportional manner, it could do so
through similar cyber attacks, air strikes, or worse. A more technical
reason for the difficulty of restricting retaliation to cyber attacks is
that it is hard to credibly threaten the assets of the attacker in a
similar fashion. If an attacker shuts down a power plant, would the
Alliance have cyber options to attack an opponent's power plants or
similar infrastructure? Would NATO even want to if it could?

64\. On balance, [NATO's ambiguity on the type of retaliation **serves a
convincing purpose**. [It]{.mark} produces doubts in the would-be
attacker's mind and [presents more options to **tailor and scale a
response**]{.mark} to re-establish deterrence]{.underline}. That being
said, in practice, this so-called cross-domain deterrence can be
complicated, problematic, and difficult to control (Nye, 2017). For
example, proportional response in the mind of the defender might look
escalatory to the attacker.

LONDON/WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - [A [cyberattack on]{.mark} a
[NATO]{.mark} member state [could trigger Article
5]{.mark}]{.underline}, its collective defence clause, [a NATO official
said]{.underline} on Monday, amid concerns that chaos in cyberspace
around Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine could spill over into other
territories. [The military alliance has for years made clear that a
serious cyberattack could trigger the clause]{.underline}, but such a
scenario has so far been largely hypothetical. \"[Allies]{.underline}
also [recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative
cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as an
armed attack,\"]{.underline} the official told Reuters. [\"[**We will
not speculate on how serious a cyberattack would have to be** in order
to trigger]{.mark} a collective response.]{.underline} Any response
could include diplomatic and economic sanctions, cyber measures, or even
conventional forces, depending on the nature of the attack,\" the
official said. [[Whether or not a cyberattack met the threshold]{.mark}
of an attack large enough to trigger Article 5 [was a \"political
decision for NATO]{.mark} Allies [to make]{.mark}]{.underline},\" they
added. Britain and the United States have warned of potential
cyberattacks on Ukraine which could have international consequences
should, for example, malicious software designed to target networks in
Ukraine start to spread elsewhere. read more There has also been concern
among cybersecurity experts that Russia could team up with some of the
gangs and people who release malicious software, such as malware used to
hold Colonial Pipeline to ransom in the United States last year. U.S.
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner said [there were [no
clear guidelines]{.mark} on how NATO]{.underline} (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) [should respond, should]{.underline} such [an attack take
place.]{.underline} \"These are things that have been in hypothetical
discussion for a decade, but because [we\'ve not come to any universal
conclusion on what those standards should be, what level of attribution
is needed]{.underline}, we\'re kind of in a very grey area,\" he told
Reuters. He posed the hypothetical case of a Russian cyberattack on
Ukraine that impacts NATO member Poland, triggering power outages that
result in hospital patients dying or knocking out traffic lights,
causing fatal road accidents involving U.S. troops deployed there.
\"[[The West]{.underline}]{.mark} may have [[wanted **strategic
ambiguity**]{.underline}]{.mark} in this area, [[and that **may still be
the right choice**]{.underline}]{.mark},\" he added. \"But [[have
we]{.underline}]{.mark} sufficiently [[made clear]{.mark} to the
Russians the [red lines]{.mark} on cyber]{.underline} or frankly to the
NATO public, the American public, on red lines on cyber? [[I don\'t

Today, [[the alliance counts **cyber**]{.mark}**security**]{.underline}
[[as one]{.mark} of its]{.underline} [**[core missions]{.mark}**. It has
placed a]{.underline} **[new cyber research]{.underline}** [center in
the heart]{.underline} of the Baltic nation.

But amid what is viewed as a sustained campaign of Russian digital
warfare on the West and the trans-Atlantic alliance ― whose foundations
are being questioned through a surge of populism ―
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[future of NATO's]{.mark} cyber
[strategy is left]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[intentionally
murky]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

During a May speech, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he is
often asked under what circumstances the organization would trigger
Article 5 in the case for a cyberattack.

[**[Article 5]{.mark}** is the alliance's principle of **collective
self-defense**]{.underline}; an attack on one member nation is
considered an attack on all member nations.

"My answer is: We will see. [The **[level]{.mark}** of cyberattack [that
would **provoke**]{.mark} **a [response]{.mark}** [must remain]{.mark}
**purposefully [vague]{.mark}**[, as will the]{.mark} nature
of]{.underline} our [[response]{.underline}]{.mark}," Stoltenberg said.
"[It could include **diplomatic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[economic]{.underline}** [sanctions, **cyber responses**, or
even]{.underline} [**conventional forces**, depending on the nature and
consequences]{.underline} of the attack."

[Questions over how NATO will respond]{.underline} to a cyberattack
[come as the alliance takes steps to **bolster** its]{.underline}
[**digital protocols**. In its joint air power strategy]{.underline},
unveiled in late June, [NATO added cyberwarfare to its joint operations
programs]{.underline}. The document boasts of the historic threat the
organization faces: "[For the first time since the end of the Cold War,
the Alliance has to be able to conduct operations."]{.underline}

[In 2014, [the alliance]{.mark} said for the first time that a
cyberattack could trigger the organization's collective-defense
mechanism. It [has proven a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[successful
deterrent]{.underline}** [to combat
**large**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[-scale]{.underline}** [digital
[attacks]{.mark} like the]{.underline} reported [Russian cyber assault
on **Estonia** in 2007]{.underline}, said Sorin Ducaru, a former
assistant secretary general of NATO. But he added that the alliance has
to be more creative in deterring medium- and low-grade cyberattacks
"because that is the world we are living in."

For Estonia, an aggressive NATO cyber policy could be the difference
between the smooth withdrawal of cash or a disturbing "error" sign
flashing on an ATM screen. An Estonian intelligence report from earlier
this year predicts Russia will continue its campaign of aggression in
Eastern Europe and the Baltic states through a combination of
cyberattacks and information warfare.

When it comes to digital threats, "each country has faced them alone.
NATO has not adopted a unified response," former Estonia President
Toomas Hendrik Ilves said during a May conference.

Today, nations are still loath to share information on cyberattacks,
Ilves said, recounting a story about how as president he reported a hack
on Estonia to NATO. "The response was: 'Oh, you, too.' I don't think
that's how we should be doing things."

Ilves is among those who have called for a cyber NATO ― an alliance of
nations cooperating in digital defense.

The top civilian of Estonia's Ministry of Defence also told Defense News
that international cooperation could help thwart cyberattacks.

"I think people are realizing that we need international cooperation,
and without international cooperation we simply cannot succeed in this
new domain," Jonatan Vseviov said.

Yet a bolstered NATO cyber response could mean a wave of new tension
with Russia and China, which are seen as two of the alliance's biggest
digital challengers.

[[It is]{.underline} **[unclear]{.underline}** [under
existing]{.underline}]{.mark} [NATO [**rules** how the alliance could be
**more aggressive**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in response to
cyberattacks]{.underline}, said Alex Crowther, a senior research fellow
at the National Defense University.

["In order [for Article 5 to be **voted on**, it has to]{.mark}
be]{.underline} [**something [major]{.mark}**. It [pretty much]{.mark}
has to be [an]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[armed attack]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline}]{.mark} [a]{.underline} [**[use of force]{.underline}**
[as discussed in the U.N. Charter. The]{.underline}]{.mark} [most
**[commonly adopted]{.mark} point of [view]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[is]{.mark} that [people have to be hurt or killed, or property]{.mark}
is damaged or [destroyed]{.mark}]{.underline}," Crowther told Fifth
Domain, a sister publication of Defense News. "I have met people who say
that [the [only]{.mark} attack that meets that criteria was the
[Stuxnet]{.mark} attack because it [caused damage]{.mark} to Iranian
centrifuges."]{.underline}

[[Even]{.mark} the hack on [Estonia did not]{.mark} meet the criteria
for [trigger]{.mark}ing the principal of [collective]{.mark}
self-[defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, Crowther added.

### 2nc -- uq -- at: "cumulative"

#### "Cumulative" language changes nothing because it's not defined -- case-by-case is still the norm

Stefan **Soesanto 21** - Senior Researcher in the Cyber Defense Team at
the Center for Security Studies (CSS) at the ETH Zurich. ("When Does a
'Cyber Attack' Demand Retaliation? NATO Broadens Its View," Defense One,

) PJW

In the 14 years [since NATO first declared that a "cyber attack" could
amount to an assault requiring collective action, alliance members have
never made it quite clear what would constitute such an
attack.]{.underline} But now they appear to be broadening the still-hazy
definition.

Since the Wales Summit of 2014, [analysts]{.underline} have largely
[worked under the assumption that a cyberattack would have to be as
destructive as a kinetic attack to reach the legal threshold that would
trigger defensive actions.]{.underline} This view was reinforced
throughout the years by NATO's use of the grammatical singular, i.e., "a
cyberattack," and the equivalency drawn between a kinetic attack and the
effects and scale of a cyberattack.

At the Cyber Defense Pledge Conference in 2018, for example, [NATO
Secretary General Stoltenberg said]{.underline}, "NATO leaders agreed
that a cyber-attack could trigger Article 5 of our founding treaty.
Where an attack on one Ally is treated as an attack on all Allies." As
recently as June 7, Stoltenberg told the Atlantic Council: "In a way [it
sends a message that a kinetic attack can of course cause a lot of
damage, and so can of course a cyberattack. It does not matter whether
it is a kinetic attack or a cyberattack. We will assess as allies when
it meets the threshold for triggering Article 5."]{.underline}

With the publication of the NATO Brussels Summit Communique on June 14,
the alliance fundamentally re-conceptualized how and what kind of
adversarial activities can lead to crossing the threshold of an armed
attack. The most important change: the insertion of the word
"cumulative."

According to paragraph 32 of the Communique,
[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[recognize]{.mark} that "[the impact
of]{.mark} significant malicious [cumulative cyber activities
might]{.mark}, in certain circumstances, [be considered]{.mark} as
amounting to [an armed attack]{.mark}."]{.underline} Asked to clarify
the insertion of the term 'cumulative,' the NATO press office responded
that (a) the term was indeed used deliberately, and (b) the reason for
using it is because the alliance has recognized that the cyber threat
landscape is evolving, and that several low impact cyber incidents by
the same threat actor can have the same impact as a single destructive
cyberattack. The Estonian Ministry of Defense added via email that "it
is paramount that we would also take into account long-term cyber
operations and attacks that might cause cumulative damage equal to what
a single cyber-attack could cause."

The Communique itself still battles with the grammatical singular of "a
cyberattack," saying, "We [[reaffirm that]{.mark} a decision as to when
a cyber attack would lead to the [invocation of Article 5 would
be]{.mark} taken by the North Atlantic Council on a
**[case-by-case]{.mark} basis**."]{.underline} But gone is the sole
equivalence to a kinetic attack. In addition, the alliance now also
recognizes the impacts of "ransomware incidents and other malicious
cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic
institutions, which might have systemic effects and cause significant
harm."

This means that NATO is finally inching away from cyberattacks as the
metric of choice, and will hopefully move toward the more relevant unit
of cumulative cyber activities -- or in other words adversarial cyber
campaigns. It is also positive to see that the threat of ransomware is
receiving recognition as a security threat within the alliance. And it
is good that NATO starts considering systemic effects resulting from
malicious cyber activities -- of which some might occur outside the
alliance's geographic area of responsibility. The 2012 attack against
Saudi Aramco for example, could have posed a systemic threat to the
majority of alliance members if oil and gas shipments were severely
disrupted over a longer period of time.

But [it [remains unclear how NATO's "cumulative" approach will
work]{.mark}. What falls into this accumulation? Non-state ransomware
campaigns? Non-destructive state-sponsored cyber espionage activity? And
do these adversarial cyber activities have to occur in parallel, within
a limited time, or are they continuously accumulated?]{.underline}

NATO's press office has said [the [move toward "cumulative]{.mark} cyber
activities" **[should not be seen as lowering the threshold for]{.mark}
triggering [Article 5]{.mark}**[, because]{.mark} (a) [there is
no]{.mark} clearly [defined threshold]{.mark} to begin with due to
NATO's strategic ambiguity, [and]{.mark} (b) triggering [Article 5 will
be discussed]{.mark} by the alliance members on a [case-by-case]{.mark}
basis -- meaning **[ultimately it is a political
decision]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This argumentation is of course
debatable and hinges upon how member states will calculate cumulative
cyber activities and which member state will push for a precedent.

threshold [[to]{.mark} an]{.underline} **[[armed
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Second, [it does not currently have an
**operational definition**]{.underline} [of what the **collective
response**]{.underline} [would be]{.underline} if that threshold were to
be crossed. [Such a cyber deterrence policy offers]{.underline}
**[several advantages]{.underline}**, but also poses distinct
challenges.

61\. A certain degree of [[ambiguity is beneficial]{.mark} because [it
could **make opponents wary**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of going too far in
their cyber attacks. [The opponent]{.mark} **always [fears]{.mark}**
stepping over [the **invisible line**, and]{.mark} thus
[prefers]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[treading
lightly]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [A similarly vague deterrence
posture]{.underline} arguably [worked well during the Cold]{.underline}
War. However, ambiguity on where the threshold lies could indeed lead an
opponent who is sufficiently comfortably with taking risks, to
continuously exploit the 'grey zones', test the defender's resolve, and
conduct ever more daring cyber attacks.

62\. [[If the Alliance were to set]{.mark} a]{.underline} [[**clear
threshold**, the opponent would]{.mark} **better [understand]{.mark}**
[how to **stay below that**]{.mark} **threshold**]{.underline}. [This
would strengthen deterrence of threats above the threshold
but]{.underline} would [**encourage** the **opponent** to **increase
attacks** just **below the threshold**]{.underline}. Arguably, the
solution for such attacks cannot be found in deterrence, but rather in
clearly defined policy response for hybrid operations. Despite its best
efforts, the Alliance continues to struggle to develop such options.
[[Setting]{.mark} **specific [thresholds]{.mark}** without strong
options for hybrid operations [would]{.mark} only [encourage
more]{.mark} of them]{.underline}. Moreover, the [[Allies could]{.mark}
also **[find it hard to agree]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on and perhaps
also credibly commit to a specific threshold.]{.underline} Thus, [[on
balance]{.mark}, the policy of]{.underline} **[[ambiguity]{.mark} on
thresholds [makes sense]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

63\. [[NATO's ambiguity]{.mark} also [extends to]{.mark} the type of
[punishment]{.mark} it threatens were it to suffer a cyber attack. [The
Alliance]{.mark} has made **clear**]{.underline} [that it
neither]{.underline} **[limits punishment]{.underline}** [to similar
cyber attacks **nor excludes**]{.underline} [them]{.underline}. Instead,
[it [keeps the **option**]{.mark} **open**]{.underline} [[to use
the]{.underline} **[full range]{.underline}** [of Allied capabilities
to]{.underline} **[deter]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[counter]{.underline}**]{.mark} [cyber [attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Once again, [[this **introduces useful doubt**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
an opponent's mind. While NATO would **retaliate**]{.underline} [in
a]{.underline} [**proportional manner**, it could do so through similar
**cyber attacks**]{.underline}, [**air strikes**, or worse. A more
**technical reason**]{.underline} [for the difficulty of restricting
retaliation to cyber attacks is that it is]{.underline} **[hard to
credibly threaten]{.underline}** [the assets of the attacker in a
similar fashion]{.underline}. If an attacker shuts down a power plant,
would the Alliance have cyber options to attack an opponent's power
plants or similar infrastructure? Would NATO even want to if it could?

64\. [On balance, NATO's **[ambiguity]{.mark}** on the **type of
retaliation**]{.underline} [serves a]{.underline} [**convincing
purpose**. It **produces doubts**]{.underline} [in the would-be
attacker's mind and **[presents]{.mark} more
[options]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to **tailor**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[scale]{.underline}**]{.mark} [a [response to
**re-establish deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That being said, in
practice, this so-called cross-domain deterrence can be complicated,
problematic, and difficult to control (Nye, 2017). For example,
proportional response in the mind of the defender might look escalatory
to the attacker.

#### The plan [gives adversaries impunity]{.underline} to confidently act [below the threshold]{.underline} \-- case-by-case evaluation is [intentional]{.underline} and [advantageous]{.underline}.

One of the most discussed issues in the international arena after the
9/11 attacks was the Digital Disaster scenario that could be experienced
in a member country (Bicakci, 2014). [Many countries have **incorporated
cyber security** strategies in their **national security** strategies in
order to **address** cyber-attacks]{.underline} that could threaten the
state. The role of NATO in the case of a serious cyberattack against a
member country has been a conundrum.

Due to the difficulty of attributing a cyber-attack, [[NATO]{.mark}
appears to have a **pragmatic** cyber **security posture** that
[handles]{.mark} each **[attack]{.mark}** on a **[case-by-case]{.mark}**
basis]{.underline} (Burton, 2015). However, [NATO [officially]{.mark}
stated that "[NATO will consider]{.mark}]{.underline} (and potentially
implement) [a collective [**Article 5** response to
cyber]{.mark}-attacks against NATO members, just as it did in response
to]{.underline} the terrorist attacks on **[9/11]{.underline}**"
(Burton, 2015, p. 308). Nevertheless, [the **[threshold]{.mark}** for
the cyber-attacks that could **invoke** Article 5 [is **not
certain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The head of
[[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} Emerging Security Challenges division,
Jamie Shea stated that "\[w\]e are [[keeping that **ambiguous** so
a]{.mark} potential [**aggressor** does not get the **idea** they
can]{.mark} carry out cyber-[attack]{.mark}s [**up to a certain level**
with impunity]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Ashford, 2014, para. 8). [Even
[though setting a]{.mark} **specific** and [**certain threshold** would
make it easier]{.mark} for NATO [to determine when to invoke]{.mark}
Article 5]{.underline} against a cyber-attack, [[keeping]{.mark} it
[ambiguous gives]{.mark}]{.underline} an [**[advantageous
flexibility]{.mark}** to the alliance [regardless of the **attack** or
**adversary**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Jones, 2015).

[[Article 5 was **purposely**]{.mark} **left [vague]{.mark}** to give
NATO **more flexibility** to **assess** a threat and **determine a
response**. Therefore, it is also uncertain what kind of a response NATO
would give]{.underline} against a cyber-attack. Would it be a cyber or a
kinetic operation against the adversary if Article 5 were triggered?
[The answer to this question is **deliberately** left **ambiguous**,
[reinforcing NATO's position]{.mark} that [it will **evaluate**
cyber-attacks on **case-by-case** basis]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Closing the [window of escalation]{.underline} encourages adversaries \-- their [choice]{.underline} of grey-zone threats [signals sensitivity]{.underline} to escalation.

31, Issue 6, p. 787-810\]

Third aspect of gray zone deterrence is that [[deterring states should
**never close the window**]{.underline} [for
**escalation**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}]{.mark} [**main
[reason]{.mark}** why the [**challengers** use **gray zone
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to change the status quo [is]{.mark}
that,]{.underline} first, [they are]{.underline}
**[discontent]{.underline}** [with the status quo and, second, [they
**recognize**]{.mark} **their [inferiority]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in
**conventional**]{.mark} **military [challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Mazzar, 2015). [The challenger may choose gray zone creeping expansion,
rather than conventional military challenge, because
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[cost]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [conventional [military challenge
would]{.mark}]{.underline} **[easily [exceed]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[potential **[gain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Therefore, [[they]{.mark}
may]{.underline} **[[refrain]{.mark} from launching]{.underline}** [the
challenge in the first place [if they realize]{.mark} that their
[expansion has **plausible risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of
**escalating**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to **military
conflict**]{.underline}. [[The **tripwire**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[definitely [has an effect]{.mark} that [the challenger estimates
**higher possibility for escalation**. If deterring states]{.mark}
absolutely **[refrain]{.mark} from escalating**]{.underline}
[countermeasures, [the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[challenger]{.mark}
side]{.underline}** [[can **continue** gray zone **creeping**]{.mark}
**expansion [eternally]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[without]{.mark} taking
**[any risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} [accompanied with escalation. In
order [to stop them]{.mark}, the deterring side needs to **develop
robust posture to win**]{.underline} [the **possible war**]{.underline}
[in the case of escalation, and **[make]{.mark} the [challengers
recognize]{.mark} the [possibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of
**unfavorable**]{.mark} **military [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[The critical role of **[military force]{.mark}**, which **[cannot be
substituted]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by other toolkit of statecraft,
exists [in]{.mark} this aspect of]{.underline} **[[gray zone
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And in this context,

[still [have an]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[irreplaceable

To answer this question, [it is important to look at the first (and
only) time NATO invoked an Article 5 response;]{.underline} namely,
[following the **9/11** attacks on the **U**nited **S**tates. When the
partners of the alliance first wrote the Washington Treaty, it was
initially to deter the Russians]{.underline} from expanding and to deter
nuclear warfare at the onset of the Cold War. [[Article 5 is
**purposefully vague** to give]{.mark} NATO considerable [**room to
maneuver**. Before]{.mark} the [9/11]{.mark} attacks led by Al Qaida,
[it would have been]{.mark}]{.underline} [**nearly [impossible]{.mark}**
[for anyone]{.mark}, anywhere, including the framers of the Washington
Treaty, [to **imagine** such an **attack**.]{.mark} Likewise, at the
2014 summit]{.underline} in Wales, [[NATO]{.mark} announced that it
would and [could invoke]{.mark} an [Article 5]{.mark} response to a
cyber-attack, [and]{.mark} that the [ambiguity would
stand]{.mark}]{.underline}.158 NATO's Ambassador Sorin Ducaru, NATO's
assistant secretary general [[for "**emerging**]{.mark} **security
[challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}," made the following remarks:

[\[T\]here's [no **predetermined
threshold**]{.mark}]{.underline}...[there [was a **conscious
decision**]{.mark} by the allies in this policy that there is benefit in
keeping **flexibility** and **ambiguity**]{.underline}...[article 5 was
**by design** something that should be **invoked politically** by
\[member\] nations in a specific context, on a case by case
basis]{.underline}...[article 5 was never designed to be triggered by a
certain threshold.]{.underline} The only time it was invoked was after
9/11, which was a scenario that had never been contemplated by the
founding partners.159 In this same vein, Christopher Painter, the U.S.'
State Department cyber coordinator said:

[The NATO leaders' declaration that **international law** including the
**UN Charter**, the **L**aw **o**f **A**rmed **C**onflict,
**i**nternational **h**umanitarian **l**aw,]{.underline} etc. [applies
in cyberspace just like]{.underline} it does in [the physical
world]{.underline}...[\[t\]his is a **clear statement** that this is not
a lawless space]{.underline}. There was some doubt before. There was
some thought you had different rules entirely for the cyber world than
the physical world, which made no sense and in fact would be very
destabilizing.160

In light of the recent developments of NATO, [[it
would]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to [[be in NATO's **best interest** to
remain **ambiguous** and allow]{.mark} the organization to approach its
[response]{.mark} to a cyber-attack [on]{.mark} a [case-by-case
basis]{.mark}. For instance]{.underline}, the
[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} on Estonia [[might **require
intervention** on behalf of]{.underline}]{.mark} the Estonian people due
to the fact they are [[a smaller]{.mark}, lesser defensible
[state]{.mark}]{.underline}. Estonia would not be successful standing up
against Russia, and as Russia becomes more aggressive in the
former-Soviet bloc region, small states like Estonia are at risk. If
another attack were to occur against Estonia, the attacks would have to
be more severe to invoke an Article 5 response. Such a response would
enable NATO states to act as if they too have been attacked as per the
mutual defense announcement against cyber-attacks at the Wales Summit.
[[Yet]{.mark}, if [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is
attacked in a similar manner, there [likely does not need]{.mark} to be
[the same scale]{.mark} of defense taken, [because the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has]{.mark} **more resources**
and [**capabilities** to respond on its own. Remaining ambiguous allows
NATO to **choose the best**]{.mark} **opportunities** for
**[support]{.mark}ing** and **defending** member states]{.underline}.

#### Strategic ambiguity necessary for offensive and defensive military flexibility

**Taddeo 17** - Associate Professor and Senior Research Fellow at Oxford
and the Programme Director of the DPhil in Information, Communication
and the Social Sciences at the Oxford Internet Institute (Mariarosaria,
"Deterrence by Norms to Stop Interstate Cyber Attacks, " Minds and
Machines, September 17,

//nt-sg

In this scenario, state actors make policy decisions to protect their
abilities to launch cyber attacks. 'Strategic ambiguity' is one of such
decisions. According to this policy, states decide neither to define and
nor inform the international community about their red
lines---thresholds that once crossed would trigger state response---for
non-kinetic cyber attacks (Taddeo 2011). [Strategic ambiguity has often
been]{.underline} presented as [a way to **confuse the opponents** about
the consequences of their cyber attacks. As the US National Intelligence
Officer for Cyber Issues officer put it:]{.underline}

[Currently most countries, including ours, don't want to be incredibly
specific about the red lines for two reasons: **You** **don't want to
invite people** to do anything they want below that red line thinking
they'll be able to do it with impunity, and secondly**, you** **don't
want to back yourself into a strategic corner** where you have to
respond if they do something above that red line or else lose
credibility in a geopolitical sense.]{.underline}

[By fostering ambiguity, state actors also **leave open** for themselves
a wider room for manoeuvring]{.underline}. [Strategic ambiguity allows
state actors to deploy cyber attacks for military, espionage, sabotage,
and surveillance purposes **without being constrained** by
their]{.underline} own policies or international [red
lines]{.underline}. This makes ambiguity a dangerous choice, one that is
strategically risky and politically misleading.

#### Ambiguity solves deterrence.

\(i\) Collective Self-Defence

[The core task of NATO is **collective self-defence**]{.underline}.
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states:

> The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
> Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
> and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each
> of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective
> self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United
> Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
> forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such
> action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
> restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

In the past, it was debated whether or not this provision applied to
malicious cyber activities. Neither a legal definition nor a universally
accepted definition of the term 'armed attack' exists, and the term is
open to interpretation. [NATO Member States consider]{.underline} that
[**malicious cyber activities** can]{.underline} potentially [constitute
**an 'armed attack'** and trigger **the right to collective
self-defence**]{.underline}. In the NATO Strategic Concept of 2010 they
declared that '\[c\]yber attacks \[...\] can reach a threshold that
threatens national and Euro{Atlantic prosperity, security and stability'
and committed itself to continuing to fulfil its essential core tasks,
inter alia, to 'deter and to defend against \[...\] emerging security
challenges', including cyber threats.46

[Some authors]{.underline}47 [assert]{.underline} that [the Alliance
needs to specify **which**]{.underline} malicious cyber [activities
will]{.underline} likely be deemed to [constitute an 'armed attack' and
judge the lack of such a declaration as a deficiency]{.underline} of the
organization. [**However**, **the absence** of such a specification can
be considered]{.underline} as a **[politically wise]{.underline}** and
therefore favourable option. [Drawing '**red lines'**]{.underline} with
regard to interpretations of key international security terms such as
'armed attack' [is not **always sensible**. Retaining **strategic
ambiguity**]{.underline} may [maintain]{.underline} or support **[a
deterrent effect]{.underline}**. Accordingly, [there is **no
'check-list'**]{.underline} specifying the level of tolerance [of the 28
Member States with]{.underline} [regard to **traditional (e.g. kinetic)
military activities** directed against an Ally]{.underline}, and thus
[claiming the necessity of **such a 'check-list'** with regard to
**malicious cyber activities** is **unconvincing**]{.underline}.
Furthermore, the decision as to whether an armed attack is present will
always be highly political and will never occur outside of a certain
political context. Therefore, [the determination whether **a certain
situation** is or is not covered by Article 5 can only be undertaken on
**a case-by-case basis** after **comprehensive consultation** between
and by consensus of the organization's 28 Member States]{.underline},
taking into consideration the political and security environment as well
as all facts and circumstances of the case.

#### Ambiguity good.

that it will evaluate cyber-attacks on case-by-case basis.

To reach these objectives, the alliance needs to become more involved in

[is]{.mark}]{.underline} not just the theoretical capacity to defend but
[the]{.underline} actual [[willingness to respond to]{.mark} all the

**clearly [crossed]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and if it then has only heavy

NATO's resolve and unity. [**[NATO]{.mark} may end up [deter]{.mark}ring
[itself more than the aggressor]{.mark}** [through fear of

Here, strategic communications have a role to play in demonstrating that
NATO is able to wield equivalent force in cyberspace as in the other
domains. Increasing the visibility of cyber defense and highlighting the
way in which cyber is being integrated into large-scale military
exercises, such as the Trident Juncture or Trident Javelin series,
conveys a message of capability and resolve. These efforts will not only
dissuade would-be aggressors from attempting to intimidate any
individual ally but also increase public confidence that NATO is
addressing the evolving cyber threat. Some recent opinion
[[pieces]{.underline}]{.mark} in the U.S. media, in particular [[calling
for a "Cyber NATO]{.mark}," have shown a [lack]{.mark} of [awareness
of]{.mark} just how much [effort NATO is actually making]{.mark} in this
area.]{.underline}22 In fact, [the alliance is already on its third

#### Ambiguity key for maximum flexibility and effective deterrence

**Mowchan 12** -- Lieutenant Colonel in the US Army and an instructor at
Center for Strategic Leadership (John, "On the Razor's Edge:
Establishing Indistinct Thresholds for Military Power in Cyberspace"
United States Army War College, 4-23-12,
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA568852.pdf) //nt-sg

Ambiguous Thresholds. [Ambiguous thresholds offer **several advantages**
for employing military power following a hostile cyber-attack against
government networks.]{.underline}

First, [[not establishing red lines allows]{.mark} government leaders
the [**flexibility** to tailor response]{.mark} options based on the
hostile act, the **perpetrator** (state or non-state), its **effects**
in the physical and digital world, and how they relate to the
current]{.underline} state of affairs in the [international
system.]{.underline} As such, the employment of military power against a
state-based threat would be much different than one against a non-state
actor that conducted the same type of attack thus validating the
necessity for ambiguous thresholds. For example, in 2009 individuals in
China and Russia penetrated computer networks that operate parts of the
U.S. electrical power grid. These individuals reportedly inserted
malware that could destroy infrastructure components. Although the
identities of the perpetrators or their associations with the Russian
and Chinese governments were not disclosed, it validates the point that
[response options must be tailored since a [**response** against]{.mark}
hackers or [hacktivists would be **different** from]{.mark} a response
[against]{.mark} the [Chinese or Russian]{.mark}
governments.]{.underline}

[A second advantage is that the U.S. **does not disclose** all facets of
its strategy to its adversaries. [If]{.mark} cyber threat [actors know
what the U.S. will do]{.mark} in response to particular hostile acts in
cyberspace, [they will]{.mark} **adjust** their strategic approaches,
**modify** their doctrine, and **develop** new cyber tactics, techniques
or procedures that **[skirt the red line]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Because
neither the national nor the defense strategy for cyberspace explicitly
defines a hostile act in cyberspace or how exactly the U.S. will
respond, this leaves it open to interpretation. In 2009 [General Kevin
Chilton, Commander U.S. Strategic Command, stated, \"I don't think you
take anything off the table when you provide \[response\] options to the
president. **[Why would we constrain ourselves]{.mark}** on how we would
respond \[to hostile acts in cyberspace\]?\" Such an [approach is **no
different** than]{.mark} how the U.S. addresses hostile acts **in the
[other]{.mark} global [domains]{.mark}**. Hostile actions in cyberspace
should be **no different**.]{.underline}

Finally, [[ambiguous thresholds **keep the adversary guessing**]{.mark}
on how the U.S. will respond]{.underline}. As was brought out by one
unidentified military official, "[[If you shut down our]{.mark} power
[grid, **maybe** we will put a missile down]{.mark} one of [your
smokestacks]{.mark}," Again, [ambiguity]{.mark} in when, how, and to
what extent to use military power [gives]{.mark} political and military
leaders **[maximum latitude]{.mark}** in developing a
response.]{.underline}

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and its **[[revisionist]{.mark}
behaviour]{.underline}** [[present]{.mark} the **[Baltic
S]{.mark}**tates [with]{.mark} a multitude of
**[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [making deterrence a]{.underline}
]{.mark}**[top [priority]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Baltic Region.
[Not only does [Moscow wish to extend its]{.mark} **[s]{.mark}phere
[o]{.mark}f [i]{.mark}nfluence**]{.underline} to include what it
describes as 'near abroad', [it must carefully protect its own model of
'**sovereign democracy'**]{.underline} at home. Prior to Russian
involvement, Ukraine was getting close to signing an association
agreement with the European Union (EU) and it was feared that
'democratic change in brotherly Ukraine could spread to Russia'.
[Transforming Ukraine to a western democracy was seen as a
**threat**]{.underline} [to the Russian regime and was thus stymied at
its source]{.underline} (Snegovaya, 2014). However, the Baltic States
have already been fully integrated into NATO and the (EU) and have been
stable democracies for over two decades now. So what is the nature of
the threat that Russia presents to the Baltic States?

[Putin is using **[hybrid tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as a means of
achieving his objectives of a **politically [restructure]{.mark}d
[Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These include]{.underline} massive
[pro-Russian **[propaganda]{.mark}**]{.underline} and misinformation
campaigns, using **[economic levers]{.underline}**,
[**[intimidation]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
employment of **[cyber]{.mark} war**]{.underline}f[are]{.underline}
elements. [In Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014, [Russia]{.underline} has
once again [demonstrated its resolve to use both military and
non-military means]{.underline} to create and fuel conflicts in pursuit
of its wider geopolitical interests. The Kremlin is busily trying to
regain its sphere of influence over nations that were formerly part of
the Soviet Union, and the Baltic States' governments are continuously
being reminded to stay alert. In addition, **[NATO frontier
allies]{.underline}** [face much more **significant
threats**]{.underline} [due to their proximity to the potential
**aggressor**]{.underline} (Grygiel and Mitchell, 2016, p. 166). [Thus,
what **[NATO needs]{.mark} most** to deter Russia is ['to
demonstrate]{.mark} **robust political [solidarity]{.mark}**[']{.mark}
within the alliance]{.underline} (NATO Parliamentary Assembly Report,
2015, pp. 4-6). [There has been a significant]{.underline}
**[increase]{.underline}** [in Russian **[probing]{.mark}** activities
to [gauge]{.mark} NATO's **[commitment]{.mark}** to the Baltic States
over the past two years]{.underline}. Grygiel and Mitchell (2016, p. 43)
define Russian probing as a 'lowmintensity and low-risk test aimed at
gauging the opposing state´s power and will to maintain security and
influence over a region'. In case of the Baltic States, [probing is
aimed at the]{.underline} **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the
strongest European countries, their power and their [will to back
up]{.mark} their most **exposed [allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As
mentioned by Grygiel and Mitchell (2016, p. 122), '[there is a strong
correlation between the **existence** of **alliances** in a given region
and the **effectiveness of deterrence**]{.underline} against a
threatening power'. [Building on the **allies' fear of abandonment** and
**US fear of entrapment** in local **conflicts**, [Russia is aiming to
**hinder**]{.mark} **their [relations]{.mark}hips** [which]{.mark} could
ultimately [provide Moscow]{.mark} with more [room for
**probing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}

Hybrid or conventional?

#### Global war

**Brands '18** \[Dr. Hal; 2018; Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished

International Studies, Charles Edel, Senior Fellow and Visiting Scholar

Republic, The Disharmony of the Spheres,
https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/hal-brands/the-disharmony-of-the-spheres\]

To see this, just work backward from the present. During the Cold War, a
bipolar balance did help avert actual war between Moscow and Washington.
But even in Europe---where the spheres of influence were best
defined---there were continual tensions and crises as Moscow tested the
Western bloc. And outside Europe, violence and proxy wars were common as
the superpowers competed to extend their reach into the Third World. In
the 1930s, the [emergence of **[German]{.mark}** and [**Japanese**
**spheres**]{.mark}]{.underline} of influence [[led to]{.mark} the
**most [catastrophic war]{.mark} in** global **history**]{.underline}.
The [empires of the **19th
century**]{.underline}---[spheres]{.underline} of influence [in their
own right]{.underline}---[continually **jostled**]{.underline} one
another, [leading to **wars**]{.underline} and near-wars over the course
of decades; the Peace of Amiens between England and Napoleonic France
lasted a mere 14 months. And looking back to the ancient world, there
were not one, but [**three** **Punic Wars** fought between Rome and
Carthage as two expanding empires came into conflict. A world defined by
**[s]{.mark}**pheres **[o]{.mark}**f **[i]{.mark}**nfluence [is]{.mark}
often a world [**characterized** by **tensions**, **wars**, and
competition]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The reasons for this are simple. As the political scientist William
Wohlforth observed, unipolar systems---such as the U.S.-dominated
post--Cold War order---are anchored by a hegemonic power that can act
decisively to maintain the peace. In a unipolar system, Wohlforth
writes, there are few incentives for revisionist powers to incur the
"focused enmity" of the leading state. Truly multipolar systems, by
contrast, have often been volatile. When the major powers are more
evenly matched, there is a greater temptation to aggression by those who
seek to change the existing order of things. And seek to change things
they undoubtedly will.

The idea that spheres of influence are stabilizing holds only if one
assumes that the major powers are motivated only by insecurity and that
concessions to the revisionists will therefore lead to peace. Churchill
described this as the idea that if one "feeds the crocodile enough, the
crocodile will eat him last."

Unfortunately, today's rising or resurgent powers are also
motivated---as is America---by honor, ambition, and the timeless desire
to make their international habitats reflect their own interests and
ideals. It is a risky gamble indeed, then, to think that **[[ceding
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** or **[China]{.underline}** an uncontested
sphere of influence [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} turn a revisionist
authoritarian regime into a satisfied power. The result, as Robert Kagan
has noted, might be to **[[embolden]{.underline}]{.mark}** those actors
all the more, by [giving them **freer rein** to bring]{.underline} their
[**near-abroads under control**, **greater latitude** and **resources**
to **[pursue]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [**[ambitions]{.mark}**, and
**[enhanced confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[the
**U.S**]{.mark}**.-led [order is fracturing]{.mark}** at its
**foundations**. For **China**, dominance over the **first island
chain** might simply **intensify** desires to achieve **primacy** in the
**second**]{.underline} island chain and beyond; [for **Russia**,
**renewed mastery** in the **former Soviet space** could lead to desires
to [bring]{.mark} parts of the former [Warsaw Pact to heel]{.mark}, as
well.]{.underline} To observe how China is developing ever longer-range
anti-access/area denial capabilities, or how Russia has been projecting
military power ever farther afield, is to see this process in action.

The **[[reemergence]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a spheres-of-influence
world [would]{.underline} thus **[[undercut]{.underline}]{.mark}** one
of the great historical achievements of U.S. foreign policy: the
creation of a system in which America is the dominant power in each
major geopolitical region and can act decisively to shape events and
protect its interests. [It would foster an environment in which
**[democratic values]{.mark}** are **less prominent**, **authoritarian**
models are **ascendant**, and mercantilism advances as **economic
[openness recedes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And rather than leading to
multipolar stability, this change could simply [[encourage]{.mark}
**greater [revisionism]{.mark}** on the part of powers whose **appetite
grows** with]{.underline} the **[eating]{.underline}**. This would lead
the world away from the relative stability of the post--Cold War era and
back into the darker environment it seemed to have relegated to history
a quarter-century ago. The phrase "spheres of influence" may sound
vaguely theoretical and benign, but its real-world effects are likely to
be tangible and pernicious.

Fortunately, the [return of a **s**pheres-**o**f-**i**nfluence **world**
is not yet inevitable]{.underline}. Even as some nations will accept
incorporation into a Chinese or Russian sphere of influence as the price
of avoiding conflict, or maintaining access to critical markets and
resources, others will resist because they see their own well-being as
dependent on the preservation of the world order that Washington has
long worked to create. The Philippines and Cambodia seem increasingly to
fall into the former group; Poland and Japan, among many others, make up
the latter. The [**[willingness]{.mark}** of even this **latter group**
[to]{.mark} take actions that [risk]{.mark} **incurring
[Beijing]{.mark}** [and **Moscow's wrath**]{.mark}]{.underline},
however, [[will be]{.mark} **constantly [calibrated]{.mark}**
[against]{.mark} an [**assessment** of **America's**]{.mark} own
[**ability** to]{.mark} **continue [lead]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing [the
**resistance** to a **s**pheres-**o**f-**i**nfluence
**world**.]{.underline} Averting that outcome is becoming steadily
harder, as the relative power and ambition of America's authoritarian
rivals rise and U.S. leadership seems to falter.

**Baldor \'18** \[Lolita; 10/3/18; Associated Press reporter, citing
Katie Wheelbarger, the principal deputy assistant defense secretary for
international security affairs; \"US to offer cyberwar capabilities to
NATO allies,\"
<https://www.fifthdomain.com/international/2018/10/03/us-to-offer-cyberwar-capabilities-to-nato-allies/>\]

Acting [to counter Russia's **aggressive**]{.underline} [use
of]{.underline} **[cyberattacks]{.underline}** [across
**Europe**]{.underline} [and **around the world**]{.underline}, [[the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} is expected to announce that, **[[if
asked]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [it [will use]{.mark} its formidable
**[cyber]{.mark}warfare [capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on NATO's
behalf]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to a senior U.S. official.

The announcement is expected in the coming days as U.S. Defense
Secretary Jim Mattis attends a meeting of NATO defense ministers on
Wednesday and Thursday.

Katie Wheelbarger, the principal deputy assistant defense secretary for
international security affairs, said [the U.S. is committing to
use]{.underline} [**[offensive]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[defensive]{.underline}**]{.mark} [cyber operations for NATO
allies]{.underline}, but America will maintain control over its own
personnel and capabilities.

[The decision comes on the heels of the]{.underline} **[[NATO]{.mark}
summit]{.underline}** in July, [when [members agreed]{.mark} to allow
the alliance to use **cyber capabilities**]{.underline} [that are
provided voluntarily by allies to protect networks and respond to
cyberattacks. [It **reflects growing concerns**]{.mark} by the U.S. and
its allies [over Moscow]{.mark}'s use of cyber operations]{.underline}
to influence elections in America and elsewhere.

\"Russia is constantly pushing its cyber and information operations,\"
said Wheelbarger, adding that [[this is a way]{.mark} for the U.S. [to
show]{.mark} its]{.underline} **[[continued commitment]{.mark} to
NATO]{.underline}**.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Wednesday that
the [[inclusion of offensive]{.mark} cyber [op]{.mark}eration[s in
**alliance missions**]{.mark}]{.underline} \"[is]{.underline} just
[one]{.underline} of many [element]{.underline}s [in]{.underline} our
**[[strengthened NATO]{.mark} cyber defenses]{.underline}**.\" And he
said that it\'s important to have cyber capabilities that can be used
against the Islamic State group to destroy the networks they use for
recruiting, financing and communicating.

He said that [the]{.underline} **[British]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Denmark]{.underline}** [have also agreed to make
cyber contributions to NATO]{.underline} and he expects other **[[allies
will follow]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

\"We have seen an increasing number of cyber-attacks. They are more
frequent, they are more sophisticated,\" Stoltenberg said. \"We see
cyber being used to meddle in domestic political processes, attacks
against critical infrastructure. Cyber will be an integral part of any
future military conflict.\"

Wheelbarger told reporters traveling to NATO with Mattis that [[the move
is a **signal**]{.mark} **to other nations**]{.underline} [that **[NATO
is prepared]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to counter cyberattacks waged
against the alliance or its members]{.underline}.

Much like America\'s nuclear capabilities, [the **[formal
declaration]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} **cyber
[support]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[can]{.mark} help [serve as a]{.mark}
military [deterrent]{.mark} to other nations and
adversaries]{.underline}.

[The U.S. has]{.underline}, for some time[, considered cyber as a
**warfighting domain**]{.underline}, much like air, sea, space and
ground operations. In recent weeks [the Pentagon released a]{.underline}
**[new cybersecurity strategy]{.underline}** [that maps out a
more]{.underline} **[aggressive use]{.underline}** [of military cyber
capabilities. And it specifically calls out **Russia** and]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** [for their use of cyberattacks]{.underline}.

China, it said, has been \"persistently\" stealing data from the public
and private sector to gain an economic advantage. And it said Russia has
use cyber information operations to \"influence our population and
challenge our diplomatic processes.\" U.S. officials have repeatedly
accused Moscow of interfering in the 2016 elections, including through
online social media.

\"We will conduct cyberspace operations to collect intelligence and
prepare military cyber capabilities to be used in the event of a crisis
or conflict,\" the new strategy states, adding that the U.S. is prepared
to use cyberwarfare along with other military weapons against its
enemies when needed, including to counter malicious cyber activities
targeting the country.

The document adds that [the Pentagon will \"work to strengthen the
capacity\" of allies and partners.]{.underline}

[[NATO has moved **cautiously**]{.mark} **on offensive
cyber**]{.underline} capabilities. [At the Warsaw Summit in]{.underline}
2016, [[allies recognized]{.mark} cyberspace as a warfighting domain. It
has said that a computer-based **[attack on an
ally]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[would **trigger**]{.mark} **NATO\'s
[commitment to defend]{.mark} its [members]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And
last year [the alliance agreed to create a new **cyber operations
center**]{.underline}. But the focus has always been on defending NATO
networks and those of its members, not offensive cyberwar.

But in the longer run, apart from the direct risks of such an event for
**[[the]{.mark} U.S.]{.underline}** itself, its **[East Asian
[alliance]{.mark} network]{.underline}**, now in its seventh decade,
[[founded on]{.mark} Japanese and Korean acceptance of U.S. **[nuclear

dramatically]{.underline}, [[bringing]{.mark} with it]{.underline}, for

Whether occurring on a Gaullist or British model, [the foundations of
Korean and Japanese relations with the United States would be
**irrevocably altered**]{.underline}. Even leaving aside the obvious
questions about the DPRK, [[in the event of a **nuclearized
Japan**]{.underline}]{.mark} and South Korea, clearly [the mathematical
**[risks of nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline} [initiated in East Asia
[would be]{.mark} very much [greater than]{.mark} even the [current
risks]{.mark} of **India-Pakistan** nuclear conflict]{.underline}.
[Regional nuclear security planning would be woven with multiple
valences of possible **perceived nuclear threats**]{.underline}. [The
calculus of [China-U.S.]{.mark} nuclear [relations]{.mark} immediately
[becomes]{.mark} much **more [complex]{.mark}**, with **China facing**
two new **potential threats**]{.underline}, nominally at least
coordinating with the U.S., [[in addition to]{.mark} the older concerns
about [**India** and **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the United
States, a nuclear-armed, fully 'normalized' Japan would never be the
undoubted loyal lapdog of by then likely postUnited Kingdom Little
England. And [the [calculations]{.mark} of a nuclear-armed South Korea
and Japan about each other [would]{.mark} start and [finish in]{.mark}
**historically-conditioned [suspicion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

At a global level, the U.S. [opening the door to
**[Japanese]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Korean [**nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}** [could]{.mark} not fail to [encourage a **cascade of
regional races**]{.mark} **to nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, not only
[[in]{.mark} the Western Pacific]{.underline} but [in [the **Middle

"Why Letting Our Allies Get Nuclear Weapons Is A Bad Idea,"

There is nothing automatic about [the nuclear **[domino
theory]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and it has been successfully countered in
some regions, but the theory [[is]{.mark} generally
**[correct]{.mark}**. The Soviet Union got the bomb
because]{.underline}, as Stalin told his scientists [after Hiroshima,
"The balance has been broken]{.underline}. Build the bomb. It will
remove the great danger from us." [Britain and France got the bomb
because the Soviets (and the U.S.) had it. China did the same, then
India]{.underline} got the bomb because China did; [Pakistan because
India did]{.underline}.

Nuclear competition in Asia would not end if South Korea decided to
build a nuclear arsenal. [[Others]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region
[[would]{.mark} likely **[follow]{.mark} suit**]{.underline}. Japan,
Taiwan, perhaps Vietnam. Similarly, a Saudi bomb would likely beget an
Iranian bomb, a Turkish bomb and even an Egyptian bomb. Far from making
the region --- and the United States --- safer, these [**[arms
races]{.mark}** would [**blanket the globe** with]{.mark} **nuclear
[tripwires]{.mark}**, each [**primed** to **unleash**]{.mark}
**unprecedented [destruction]{.mark}** at the slightest
twitch]{.underline}.

Where you stand determines what you see. Kennedy and the other
[presidents]{.underline} stood atop the chain of command, and their own
experiences with that awful responsibility (particularly with the
near-miss of the Cuban Missile Crisis) colored how they saw nuclear
politics. They [recognized the limitations of theory in a world
characterized by **imperfect information** and the **frictions of human
interaction**. They understood what the nuclear theorists could not ---
that more countries having nuclear weapons would **only increase** the
risk of their use, **not lessen** it]{.underline}.

Three months before the Cuban Crisis, Kennedy's Secretary of Defense,
Robert McNamara, gave a speech in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he laid out
this danger. "The mere fact that no nation could rationally take steps
leading to nuclear war does not guarantee that a nuclear war cannot take
place," he said. "Not only do nations sometimes act in ways that are
hard to explain on a rational basis, but [**even when**
acting]{.underline} in a **['rational']{.underline}** way
[they]{.underline} sometimes, indeed disturbingly [often, act on the
basis of **misunderstandings**]{.underline} of the true facts of a
situation. They misjudge the way others will react, and the way others
will interpret what they are doing."

[Any attempt to rationalize nuclear relationships --- treating
adversaries like two sides of a balanced equation --- removes the
**human factor**: the tendency towards irrationality and error. In a
world with just a handful of nuclear states, that factor has **already**
nearly led to [apocalypse]{.mark}. In a world with a **dozen more**,
those [risks]{.mark} would **[go up
exponentially]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[It does not have to be this way. [For]{.mark} over [50 years]{.mark},
since the]{.underline} signing of the Nuclear
**[N]{.underline}**on-**[P]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty, [successful diplomacy, **security
[assurances]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} global [norms]{.mark} have largely
**[kept]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [at bay]{.mark}**[. The
nightmare]{.mark} scenario of dozens of nuclear states [has]{.mark} **so
far [been averted]{.mark}**, in no small part [through]{.mark} the
conscious and continual [effort of **America**]{.mark}]{.underline}n
presidential administrations of both parties. Yes, there will always be
those who advocate for more nuclear weapons in more hands. But the
forces of restraint, and with it, **[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
have prevailed and [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[prevail if
**U.S.**]{.mark} **policy [leads the way]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Commentators like Samuel Huntington and Zbiegniew Brezinski asserted
that a world without US primacy would be a world of violence and
disorder, less democracy and economic growth; American primacy
facilitates global peace.1 Thus BMD was cast as inherently defensive; it
enables the US to protect the global commons and international economic
system that benefits all nations as the US assumes the role of a
global-ordering superpower.2 Bush administration officials supported
this position, in line with Hegemonic Stability Theory, holding that BMD
could restore the freedom of action that would be lost in the second
nuclear age, by allowing America to retain the capability to project
power.3 There is some support for the nuclear age thesis. Firstly, nine
states have nuclear weapons and apparently 49 countries have the know
how to construct them.4 Secondly, to reduce greenhouse gases, [many
states]{.underline} may soon judge it prudent to [construct nuclear
power plants]{.underline}. Thirdly, [states like]{.underline} Japan,
**[[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark}** and South Korea [[have **latent**
nuclear]{.mark} weapons [potential and could]{.mark} apparently
[militarize]{.mark} their program [in]{.mark} the space of a **few
[months]{.mark}**]{.underline}; Myanmar was suspected of having a covert
program; Russia helped Iran build its Bushehr power plant and many
states around the Persian Gulf are considering developing civilian
programs. Syria also had a covert nuclear program until an Israeli
strike in 2007.5 Finally, the IAEA is tasked with the contradictory
mission of promoting the spread of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes
and inhibiting its diversion to military purposes. These goals are not
mutually exclusive as the former provides a path towards weaponization.6

Finally, [[NATO needs]{.mark} to **maintain [ambiguity]{.mark}**
[on]{.mark} what justifies **an [Article 5
response]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As mentioned previously,
[[ambiguity]{.mark} has [served NATO well. **A**]{.mark} **set
[threshold]{.mark}** for when NATO will invoke an Article 5 response to
a cyber-attack on a member country [is **not necessary**]{.mark}. This
ambiguity has **historically served** the alliance well]{.underline}, as
demonstrated by the 9/11 attacks. [[If]{.mark} the]{.underline} alliance
had [[said weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} were [[**only include**
guns]{.mark}, bullets, tanks, and bombs, [it would]{.mark}]{.underline}
have [set **a threshold** [preclud]{.mark}ing **a NATO
[response]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} attacks that turned **four planes** into
**improvised [missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The larger issue of
ambiguity is that there is no set definition of what constitutes an
armed attack and what circumstances dictate a collective response, as
per Article 5. [[**Remaining ambiguous** on]{.mark} **the severity
[threshold]{.mark}** of a cyber-attack [allows]{.mark} the [alliance to
act in cases of]{.mark} **future [cyber-attacks]{.mark}** [that
cause]{.mark} **severe [damage]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[allow NATO to [refrain from **over-reacting**]{.mark}, **even if** an
event is a cyber]{.underline}, or kinetic, [attack]{.underline} as per a
definition. [It would be a mistake to set a threshold for attacks that
cannot **currently be anticipated**]{.underline}.

The conservative case for NATO is not that it strengthens liberal world
order. Rather, the conservative case for [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} is
that it [[bolsters American]{.mark} **national [interests]{.mark}**[.
In]{.mark} an age of **great-power [competition]{.mark}**]{.underline},
as identified by the Trump administration, [America's Western alliance
provides the U.S. with]{.underline} some [dramatic **comparative
advantages**. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Canada,
and]{.underline} their [European [allies have]{.mark}]{.underline} a
number of [**[common]{.mark} interests** and common [**challenges**
with]{.mark} regard to [**Beijing**, **Moscow**,
**terror**]{.mark}**ism**, **[cyber]{.mark}attacks**, **migration**,
**[nucl]{.mark}ear weapon[s]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} **military
[readiness]{.mark}**[. NATO]{.mark} is the one]{.underline} formal
[alliance that **[allows for coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline} on these
matters. [It is]{.underline} also [[the **only alliance** that]{.mark}
embodies America's]{.underline} civilizational [ties with
Europe]{.underline} --- a point forcefully made by President Trump when
he visited Poland in 2017. Properly understood, [NATO]{.underline} helps
[[keeps]{.mark} America's **strategic [competitors]{.mark}** [at
bay]{.mark}, pushing back on **Russian** and **Chinese
influence**]{.underline}. In all of these ways, [the U.S. alliance
system in Europe is]{.underline} a bit like **[oxygen]{.underline}**.
You may take it for granted, but [you'll miss it when it's
gone]{.underline}.

Now [consider the **alternative**. American **[withdrawal]{.mark}** from
NATO would be a **grave error**. Not only [would]{.mark} it
[**surrender** the **above**]{.mark} **advantages** [and
**undo**]{.mark} **existing [progress]{.mark}** [in E]{.mark}urope. It
would]{.underline} also [have negative **long-term implications**
globally pertaining to America's foremost]{.underline} long-term
[strategic challenge:]{.underline} namely, the People's Republic of
[China. As Beijing **extends** its **influence**]{.underline} worldwide,
[U.S. **[disengagement]{.mark}** from NATO would **send the
[signal]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is]{.mark} an **[unreliable]{.mark}
friend**. America's allies]{.underline} and partners [in the
Indo-Pacific would]{.underline} have to **[rethink]{.underline}** the
integrated [security architecture]{.underline} we have painstakingly
built since Eisenhower's day. [This is [not to
mention]{.mark}]{.underline} the obvious and [immediate
**[tactical]{.mark}** and **operational** military [advantages
that]{.mark} would **[accrue to Russia]{.mark}** in Europe,
[shifting]{.mark} the **balance of [power]{.mark}** against the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

\[NATO Getting More Aggressive on Offensive Cyber, 5-24-2019,
https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/05/nato-getting-more-aggressive-offensive-cyber/157270/\]

In the latest signal [[NATO is adopting]{.mark} a **[tough]{.mark}er
[posture]{.mark}** [against **cyber**]{.mark} and **electronic
[attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Secretary General Jens
[Stoltenberg]{.underline} this week [said]{.underline} that [the
defensive alliance will **not** remain **purely
defensive**]{.underline}.

Stoltenberg told attendees at the Cyber Defence Pledge conference in
London, [["We are **not limited** to]{.mark} respond in
[cyber]{.mark}space [when]{.mark}]{.underline} we are
[**[attacked]{.mark}** in cyberspace."]{.underline}

[NATO [members]{.mark}]{.underline} have already [["**agreed** to
integrate]{.underline}]{.mark} national [cyber
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} or offensive cyber [into Alliance
operations and missions,"]{.underline} he said. But [[the **parameters**
of]{.mark} a **NATO [response]{.mark}** to cyber attacks [remains
**undefined**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2015, Stoltenberg said that [a
cyber [attack]{.mark} against one member nation [could trigger]{.mark}
an **[Article 5]{.mark} collective [response]{.mark}** [by all]{.mark}
members]{.underline}. Yet only once has a collective response ever been
invoked, at the request of the United States following the attacks of
September 11, 2001. NATO is a defensive organization, so [what an
offensive]{.underline} cyber [posture looks like remains]{.underline}
something of [a mystery. [A]{.mark}n Article 5 [response can take
**many**]{.mark} **different [forms]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[That's the **strength of the article**]{.underline}]{.mark}, according
to NATO Deputy General Secretary Rose Gottemoeller. However, while an
Article 5 response can be unpredictable, it must be coordinated, which
can be tricky with many different partners in possession of many
different capabilities.

At an event in May, Gottemoeller said NATO was in the processes of
establishing a new innovation board to "bring together all of the parts
of and pieces of NATO that have to wrestle with these new technologies
to really try to get a flow of information. Many of you having served in
any international institution or government, you know how things can get
stove-piped. So [[we]{.mark} are resolved to **[break
down]{.mark}**]{.underline} those [[stove-pipes]{.underline}]{.mark},
particularly [where **innovation** is concerned,"]{.underline} she said.

[[NATO is building]{.mark} a **cyber [command]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that is [[scheduled to be]{.mark} **fully
[operational]{.mark}**]{.underline} in 2023 [[and will
**coordinate**]{.mark} and **conduct** all offensive [cyber
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Until then, [whatever
[NATO]{.mark} does offensively, it [will **rely**]{.mark} **heavily**
[on the]{.mark} U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the
**discretion** of **[U.S.]{.mark} commanders**]{.underline}, according
to Sophie Arts, program coordinator for security and defense at the
German Marshall Fund, who explains in this December report.

"Yesterday's remarks indicate that [NATO's leadership is
**[thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline} more [**seriously** [about
**buttressing**]{.mark} the alliance's **[deterrence]{.mark} posture**
[in cyber]{.mark}space [and]{.mark} **address [threats]{.mark}** that
fall [under]{.mark}]{.underline} the threshold of [an [Article 5]{.mark}
violation,"]{.underline} she told Defense One.

[["This tracks]{.mark} recent **[shifts]{.mark} in strategy** [adopted
by]{.mark} **several NATO [allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including the
United States, [[which]{.mark} integrate **offensive cyber operations**
as an **important tool** to **proactively [address]{.mark}** growing
instances of [cyber interference]{.mark}]{.underline} from hostile
actors."

#### Maintaining [ambiguous commitments]{.underline} is vital to assurance \-- allies [purposefully agreed]{.underline} to allow [totally flexibility]{.underline}.

**Kofman '16** \[Michael; 2016; Analyst at CNA Corporation and Fellow at

[[NATO's **best answer**]{.mark} to compellence [is **strategic
flexibility**]{.mark} and **ambiguity** of response. [While Article V
dictates]{.mark} the **[defense]{.mark}** of a member, it [**doesn't**
stipulate **what**]{.mark} that [defense must be, **how** it should take
shape]{.mark}, or **where** it will be applied. [With U.S. forces in
place, **NATO members can be assured**]{.mark} **that [Article V will be
triggered]{.mark}**[, but **what happens next** should be **left a
question mark**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The more NATO emphasizes the
Russian threat and argues for fixed forces in place, the less capably it
can defend a challenge to its credibility as an alliance. Anyone can
count the order of battle and the balance of forces. [By introducing
**ambiguity** in its potential response once Article V has been
declared, NATO **reduces the chance** it can **easily be manipulated**
into a credibility test]{.underline}. The objective should be shrouding
a Baltic high-end fight in incalculable risk for Russia while
maintaining uncertainty and strategic flexibility with air and naval
assets.

#### The plan shreds assurance.

**Stoltenberg 18** -- Jens Stoltenberg, NATO secretary general and the
former prime minister of Norway. \[How NATO Defends Against the Dark
Side of the Web, 9-6-18,
https://www.wired.com/story/how-nato-defends-against-the-dark-side-of-the-web/\]

If [cyberattacks]{.underline} were physical attacks, using bombs or
missiles instead of computer code, they could be considered an act of
war. But instead, [some are using]{.underline} software [to
wage]{.underline} soft-[war with **very real**, and]{.underline}
potentially **[deadly, consequences]{.underline}**.

[For]{.underline} almost [**70 years**, [NATO has been **the bedrock**
of]{.mark} **transatlantic [security]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whether [on
land, at sea, or in the air. The same is]{.underline} now [true [in
**cyberspace**]{.mark}. A cyberattack can **now trigger** Article
5]{.underline} of NATO\'S founding treaty, which states that an attack
on one Ally is an attack on all Allies.

[The [level]{.mark} of cyberattack [that would
provoke]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO into a response under [[Article 5 must
remain]{.mark} **purposefully [vague]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as will the
nature of our response. [**[A]{.mark} clearly [defined
threshold]{.mark}** only [invites attacks]{.mark} **immediately
[beneath]{.mark}** [it. That is]{.mark} **the logic of
[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But NATO's response could include
diplomatic or economic sanctions, a digital counter attack, or even
conventional force, depending on the nature and consequences of the
attack. [[NATO will]{.mark} **always [follow]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
principle of [[restraint]{.mark} and act in accordance [with
**i**]{.mark}**nternational [law]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Two years ago, NATO]{.underline} leaders [pledged to
invest]{.underline} more [in cyber defense]{.underline}. Since then,
almost [**[every Ally]{.mark}** has [upgraded]{.mark} its **[cyber
defenses]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and we see countries like France,
Britain and the United States investing heavily in their cyber defenses.
NATO is helping all Allies to work together, to pool their knowledge and
help each other.

NATO shares information about technological threats in real-time---as we
did with the EU, nations and private companies during the WannaCry
attack. We are integrating national cyber capabilities into NATO
planning and operations. We have Cyber Rapid Reaction teams on standby
to assist Allies 24 hours a day, while exercises, research, and training
are led by the NATO Center of Excellence for Cyber Defense in Estonia,
established after a huge cyberattack took down the websites of Estonian
banks, media, and government bodies in 2007.

[[**Being strong** in cyber]{.mark}space [is]{.mark}]{.underline} now
[[**as important** for]{.underline}]{.mark} [**our [deterrence]{.mark}
efforts** [as]{.mark}]{.underline} having [**strong [conventional
forces]{.mark}**. Deterrence is about making **the potential costs** of
an attack **too high** and the potential gains of an attack **too
low**]{.underline}.

[[By agreeing]{.underline}]{.mark} that [a [cyber]{.mark}attack [can
trigger]{.mark} **an [Article 5]{.mark} response by all Allies**, **the
potential [cost]{.mark}** of action [by an aggressor is
**high**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But we must also lower the potential
gains of any attack. Even the most advanced system is only as secure as
its users. Some of the biggest cyberattacks have only been possible
because of human error---picking up an infected USB drive placed in a
parking lot and plugging it into a computer, say, or clicking on a bad
link in a phishing email. It is time for us to wake up to the potential
dangers.

In the Second World War, the saying was "loose lips sink ships." Today
it is using weak passwords, failing to update software programs, or
opening unfamiliar emails. Simple things. But if we get them right, we
go a long way to protecting ourselves.

The digital revolution has made our lives better. But, like in the
physical world, there are dangers. NATO and [NATO Allies are doing
**everything possible** to keep]{.underline} our [nations]{.underline}
and our people [safe]{.underline}, including [in
cyberspace]{.underline}.

#### Allies want [more]{.underline} assertive cyber postures, [NOT]{.underline} less.

Cyber Commitment for NATO, 10-10-20,
https://www.cfr.org/blog/sharing-caring-united-states-new-cyber-commitment-nato\]

Given the recent blockbuster headlines about alleged Chinese snooping on
server hardware sold to major technology companies and the latest
joint-denunciation of Russian cyber operations, you could be forgiven
for having missed an important NATO-related development. The Associated
Press reports that the U.S. Defense Department will announce a [[**new
commitment** to use]{.mark} **offensive and defensive
[cyber]{.mark}security [capabilities]{.mark}** [on behalf of]{.mark}
**NATO [allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**The new commitment** [is **notable**]{.mark}]{.underline} given how
cybersecurity has long been treated as an exceptional domain of
operations, and cyber capabilities reserved as strategic national assets
to be shared with only the closest of allies. With this announcement,
the Pentagon is suggesting that cyber capabilities might be used
alongside conventional weapons with allies and indeed, equal weight
appears to be given to offensive and defensive operations. Perhaps most
significantly, the announcement moves NATO partners closer to what has
been a tight coterie of U.S.-favored signals intelligence partners such
as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.

The DoD announcement is a sign of the continued, if nascent,
normalization of cybersecurity under the current administration and in
Europe. Even where offensive cyber operations may not rise to the level
of war, they provide decision-makers with options to influence the
geopolitical environment. This aligns with recent trends in the U.S.
military to integrate cyber capabilities into maneuver units and large
exercises, and reflects the shift towards more risk acceptant and
offensive measures to counter cyberattacks found in the 2018 DoD Cyber
Strategy.

Moving cyber capabilities into the same strategic frame as conventional
weapons, especially with NATO, reflects a shift in institutional cyber
arrangements within the United States and the growing power of the
military relative to the intelligence community. For the United States,
cyber capabilities have always had a complicated relationship with the
intelligence community, in particular the National Security Agency
(NSA). When Cyber Command stood up in 2010 as a sub-unified combatant
command within the Department of Defense, it moved into the NSA's
headquarters, staffed its management ranks with longtime NSA employees,
borrowed networks and technical capabilities, and to this day shares a
dual-hatted commander. In the immediate years after the command was
created, it was logical that the structure of partnerships with allies
looked more like the special signals intelligence relationships formed
around the NSA rather than traditional alliance networks in NATO and
Asia. The recent announcement aligns cyber operations more closely with
Department of Defense missions, which are more likely to posture
capabilities for deterrent effects, than intelligence missions, which
view capabilities as assets to be carefully husbanded.

Treating cybersecurity capabilities more like conventional arms and less
like national assets also helps drive the integration of cyber
operations into the planning and execution of a broader array of
conventional military missions. Early cyber operations were largely
conventional espionage and surveillance activities supercharged by the
spread of computing and the internet. In the United States, this led to
the creation of large and complex software tools, carefully guarded by
the intelligence community as national assets (sometimes
unsuccessfully). The DoD's announcement indicates a move towards
treating at least some of these capabilities, along with their
supporting infrastructure, more like conventional armaments and making
them available for broader use; a model closer to Central or Special
Operations Command and less like the National Security Agency.

[The Pentagon's **new [commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline} also [[reflects
changes in how Europe **talks** about cyber]{.mark}security [and]{.mark}
[characterizes]{.mark} the [Russian threat]{.mark}. **The last [two
years]{.mark}**]{.underline} have seen a [[trend to]{.mark}ward **more
[open discussion]{.mark}**]{.underline} of offensive cyber operations
and the possibility [[of]{.mark} the alliance [adopting]{.mark} [**more
assertive postures** to counter **cyber**]{.mark}
**[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} its
[members]{.mark}]{.underline}. After years of devastating ransomware
attacks and cyber-enabled information attacks, [NATO
[members]{.mark}]{.underline} are more willing to [[explore **cyber
triggers to Article 5**]{.mark}. They have]{.underline} also
[been]{.underline} more [[willing to articulate **the**]{.mark} **cyber
[threat]{.mark}** [against the alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
addition to last week's denunciation by Dutch, UK, and U.S. authorities,
Russian state actors are widely suggested to be responsible for an
increasingly brazen series of operations, including targeting German
government ministries, French and British TV stations, and more.

#### Limitations [buck the trend]{.underline} -- honoring [collective defense requests]{.underline} is key to cyber-assurance.

Development of the approaches of NATO and the EU The principal focus of
NATO's cyber defence approach has always been the protection of its own
headquarters, agencies, and operations. [The [Alliance has been
**improving**]{.mark}]{.underline} its [cyber
[defence]{.mark}]{.underline} capabilities [since 1990s]{.underline}.
The first well-known cyber incident against NATO took place in 1999
during NATO's operation "Allied Force" in Kosovo when hacker groups from
Russia and Serbia disrupted NATO's internal systems.14 Few years later,
at the Prague Summit in 2002, [cyber security]{.underline} appeared for
the first time [on **NATO's**]{.underline} political [agenda with [NATO
declar]{.mark}ing [to "**strengthen**]{.mark}]{.underline} our
[**[capabilities]{.mark}** to defend [against **cyber**]{.mark}
**attacks**."]{.underline}15 In the same year, [[the
**N**]{.underline}]{.mark}orth **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**tlantic
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ouncil (NAC) [[approved a]{.mark} **Cyber
Defence [Programme]{.mark}** and]{.underline} as part of this,
[the]{.underline} NATO Computer Incident Response Capability
(**[NCIRC]{.underline}**) - NATO's emergency [team [to **prevent**,
**detect** and **respond**]{.mark} to cyber incidents - was
created]{.underline}.16 The [cyber [attacks against
**Estonia**]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2007 [that disabled]{.underline} its
[governmental]{.underline}, media and financial [websites [and
the]{.mark} **Russia-[Georgia war]{.mark}** in 2008 that included
**military offence**]{.underline} against Georgian military forces [and
**cyber attacks**]{.underline} against Georgian webpages17 [[helped
NATO]{.mark} to [realize]{.mark}]{.underline} how [[it was
**behind**]{.mark} in cyber space]{.underline}. Subsequently, [[the
Alliance]{.mark}'s focus [**broadened** from]{.mark} the security of
[its]{.mark} **own [networks]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} that of its **[member
states]{.mark}**]{.underline}.18 In January 2008 [NATO]{.underline}
approved its first Policy on Cyber Defence [[stressing "the
**need**]{.mark} **for NATO**]{.underline} and nations [[to]{.mark}
protect key **information systems**]{.underline} \[...\]; share best
practices; [and provide]{.underline} a [**capability** to
**[assist]{.mark} Allied [nations]{.mark}**[, **upon request**]{.mark},
to counter a cyber attack."]{.underline}19 In the same year, [it
established the]{.underline} Cyber Defence Management Authority
[(**CDMA**) to **[coordinate]{.mark}** cyber defence, **review
[capabilities]{.mark}** [and conduct]{.mark} appropriate **security risk
[management]{.mark}** across the Alliance]{.underline}. It also
accredited the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre for Excellence (CCD COE)
with the main objectives to improve the interoperability of NATO and
enhance cyber awareness, education, and training efforts. In 2009 cyber
defence was rendered an integral part of NATO exercises. In 2010 the
[Lisbon]{.underline} Summit [addressed cyber defence **capabilities
gaps**]{.underline} including improvements to the NCIRC,
[and]{.underline} in the same year [the **E**]{.underline}merging
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[C]{.underline}**hallenges
**[D]{.underline}**ivision [was created within
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} International Staff [with a mandate to
**[analyse]{.mark}** among other **[asymmetric]{.mark}al
[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} cyber threats. The Defence Policy and
Planning Committee/Cyber Defence (from 2014 titled the Cyber Defence
Committee) was also established to provide political-level guidance and
oversight. In 2011 the Cyber Defence Management Board (CDMB, supplanted
CDMA), which consists of NATO cyber experts at the political, military,
operational, and technical levels was set up. [Its purpose is to
**coordinate cyber defence** activities throughout NATO]{.underline} and
associated agencies, [and]{.underline} to [facilitate implementation of
NATO's cyber defence]{.underline} policies [and
capabilities]{.underline}.20 In June 2011 a revised Cyber Defence Policy
was approved, confirming the resolve to protect NATO's networks and
assist member states in the event of cyber attack. It also commanded the
establishment of two cyber Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) by the end of
2012 with a core of six professionals that can be deployed within 24
hours to a member state.21 [**[Any]{.mark} NATO [nation]{.mark}** [under
cyber attack could **request**]{.mark}]{.underline} the team's
**[[assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}** through the CDMB22, the deployment
must be approved by the North Atlantic Council (which may be politically
challenging). The policy also defined minimum requirements to national
networks critical to NATO's core tasks and assistance to the Allies to
achieve the minimum levels of security. Additionally, the Defence Policy
and Planning Committee in Reinforced format (DPPC(R)) was set up to
oversee the work of CDMB and manage the overall planning process,
including cyber capabilities.23 In 2012 the NATO Communications and
Information Agency (NCIA) was established.24

Further Proliferation

[Nuclear proliferation]{.underline} poses an additional threat to
international peace and security because it [causes **further
proliferation**. [As]{.mark} former [Secretary]{.mark} of State George
[Schultz]{.mark} **once [said]{.mark}**[, 'prolif]{.mark}eration [begets
prolif]{.mark}eration']{.underline}65 [When one country acquires nuclear
weapons, its **regional [adversaries]{.mark}**, feeling threatened by
its neighbor's **new nuclear capabilities**, [are **more
likely**]{.mark}]{.underline} to attempt [[to acquire
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} in response.
Indeed, [the [history]{.mark} of nuclear proliferation [can be read
as]{.mark} **one long [chain reaction]{.mark} of
proliferation**]{.underline}.

Of course, [reactive proliferation does **not always
occur**]{.underline}. In the early 1960s, for example, US officials
worried that a nuclear-armed China would cause Taiwan, Japan, India,
Pakistan, and other states to acquire nuclear weapons.66 In hindsight,
we now know that they were correct in some cases, but wrong in others.
Using statistical analysis, Philipp Bleek has shown that reactive
proliferation is not automatic, but that rather, states are more likely
to proliferate in response to neighbors when three conditions are met
(1) there is an intense security rivalry between the two countries, (2)
the potential proliferant state does not have a security guarantee from
a nuclear-armed patron (3) and the potential proliferant state has the
industrial and technical capacity to launch an indigenous nuclear
program.67 In other words, [**[reactive prolif]{.mark}eration** [is
**real**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but conditional. To be sure, as Barry
Posen has argued, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey all have primitive
nuclear infrastructures and it would be difficult for any of them to
build nuclear weapons overnight.68 In addition, Turkey is a member of
NATO and Saudi Arabia enjoys a close security partnership with the
United States and these states might prefer to lounge in the shade of
America's nuclear umbrella rather than build independent arsenals. On
the other hand, one or more of these states, much like the United
Kingdom and France in the early days of the Cold War, might decide that
America's nuclear protection is insufficient. With a decade's worth of
dedicated nuclear development, any of these states could conceivably
become nuclear powers. Just because reactive proliferation takes time,
does not mean that it is not a problem. If Iran enters the nuclear club,
therefore, it is likely that some, but not all, of the countries that we
currently worry about will eventually become nuclear powers.

We should worry about the spread of nuclear weapons in every case,
therefore, because the problem will likely extend beyond that specific
case. As Wohlstetter cautioned decades ago, [[prolif]{.mark}eration [is
**an N+1 problem**]{.mark}]{.underline}.69

In sum, [[nucl]{.mark}ear [prolif]{.mark}eration [gives us]{.mark}
**many [reasons]{.mark}** to [fear]{.mark} **the [spread of

threats**, it would be **an even greater sin** to **underestimate** them

Alliance Politics of Nuclear Proliferation," p. 149-157\]

How do alliances curb potential or actual cases of nuclear
proliferation, if at all? Many scholars argue that alliances are
effective tools for bridling the nuclear ambitions of states. When
allies do try to acquire nuclear weapons, their alliance relationships
serve as conduits for the guarantor to coerce a nonproliferation
outcome. In this book, I show that such optimism about the role military
alliances play is overstated. [Alliances can deter nuclear proliferation
if they marry written pledges of support with compatible foreign policy
and defense doctrines as well as in-theater conventional deployments.
Yet alliances are prone to **severe [adjustments]{.mark}** that can
[**unsettle** the ally. When **guarantors** make]{.mark} major
**unilateral [changes]{.mark}** to the security relationship,
[through]{.mark} undesirable **doctrinal
[announcements]{.mark}**]{.underline} or troop withdrawals,
[**abandonment [fears]{.mark}** [intensify]{.mark}. The affected [ally
becomes]{.mark} **so [doubtful]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} its received
[guarantees that it]{.mark} becomes more likely to [engage in]{.mark}
**nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration**--related behavior]{.underline}.
Unfortunately for the guarantor, curbing such behavior once it has
started is very difficult. It requires fixing the broken security
guarantee that prompted the nuclear interest in the first place.
Nonmilitary tools like economic sanctions may be the best coercive
instruments available, but their viability depends on the extent to
which the ally relies on the guarantor. Simply put, alliances are better
for deterring potential than for preventing actual nuclear
proliferation.

The [**empirical [cases]{.mark}** [support this]{.mark}
argument]{.underline}. Table 2 summarizes the main findings. [Fears of
abandonment in West Germany intensified]{.underline} after July 1956
[amid rumors that]{.underline} the [Eisenhower]{.underline}
administration [would reduce the size of the US Army by a
third]{.underline}. Shortly thereafter, West Germany joined France and
Italy in a short-lived and unsuccessful effort to develop nuclear
weapons. Throughout the subsequent decade, Bonn deflected calls for it
to make clear nonproliferation pledges while obtaining enrichment and
reprocessing capabilities. Its alliance with the United States certainly
constrained its decision-making, but arguments that distinct coercion
episodes prompted West German leaders to renounce nuclear proliferation
are overstated. Domestic politics and prestige considerations were
important factors as well.

Japan followed a somewhat similar trajectory. It began evaluating the
strength of its received security guarantees more fastidiously following
China's nuclear device detonation in late 1964. Yet Japan did not begin
making serious moves in investing in nuclear technology until the
prospect of American withdrawal from Vietnam and even East Asia became
highly likely at the end of the decade. Similarly to West Germany, Japan
did not have an actual program dedicated to the production of an
indigenous nuclear weapons capability. But like that of West Germany,
Japan's stance toward nuclear nonproliferation remained dubious. When
Japan finally ratified the NPT, it did so largely because of domestic
politics. Ideational arguments about the inherent value of the bomb were
also influential. The United States provided assurances when asked to do
so but had largely refrained from efforts to compel Japan into making
nonproliferation commitments. Nevertheless, some controversy ensued not
long after NPT ratification regarding activities at a Japanese
reprocessing plant.

South Korea had a clear intent to acquire nuclear weapons. Despite South
Korea's weathering various provocations by North Korea, what triggered
South Korea to seek nuclear weapons was Nixon's unexpected announcement
that the United States would withdraw one US Army division from the
peninsula. Thankfully for Washington, South Korea depended on the United
States for economic and technological goods, thus rendering South Korea
vulnerable to American efforts in suppressing the program in 1976.
Still, South Korea's interest in nuclear weapons was not entirely
snuffed out. Some speculate that the program went further underground.
Whatever the truth, safeguard violations did occur in the 1980s.

Although I have not studied them at the same level of detail, the five
smaller cases further corroborate the argument. Great Britain and France
both sought nuclear weapons in part because of having to fight alone and
without American support. What distinguishes Great Britain from France
is that Great Britain came to depend on American technology for its
nuclear deterrent. Great Britain still retains operational independence,
but the French nuclear arsenal is fully autonomous from the United
States. For its part, Norway remained satisfied with the security
provided by the United States, so much so that it rejected having much
of an American conventional military presence until the 1980s when it
accepted pre-positioned gear from the US Marine Corps. Only very briefly
at the beginning of the Cold War did Norwegian military leaders consider
nuclear weapons. By contrast, Australia wanted more alliance goods but
had no guarantor---whether the United States or Great Britain---that
would supply them. On the basis of its security fears, Australia had a
nuclear weapons program that it eventually renounced following a change
in government. Alliance coercion arguably played no part. Finally,
Taiwan began its attempt to produce nuclear weapons once it sensed that
the geopolitical tide was turning against it. The United States
gradually seemed more open to accommodating China, which had by that
point come to possess nuclear weapons. What ensued was a cat-and- mouse
game that spanned about two decades. The United States used different
levers to ensure that Taiwan would not go nuclear, but its success in
restraining Taiwan's ambitions appears to have had more to do with
intelligence than with sanctions per se.

The takeaway of this book is that alliances are better for deterring
states from engaging in nuclear proliferation--related behavior than for
compelling states to give up their nuclear weapons programs. In this
chapter, I address the implications for theory and policy. In so doing,
I outline possible avenues for future research as well as how my
analysis sheds light on contemporary policy problems.

Theoretical Implications

My argument has several theoretical implications for how we should think
about key questions in international relations theory. First, I show
that my analysis bears on a contemporary debate in international
relations regarding how beliefs about credibility are formed. Second, I
argue that scholars are wrong to divide the study of nuclear weapons
from that of conventional military power. Third, I add to the growing
scholarship on the effectiveness of coercion in international relations
by considering the alliance politics of nuclear proliferation.

THE BASIS OF CREDIBILITY

One major debate among international relations scholars concerns the
basis of credibility: what makes threats---and, for that matter,
promises---believable? A dominant school of thought holds that
assessments of credibility turn on situational considerations like the
war-fighting capabilities and geopolitical stakes involved behind the
threats or promises that states make to one another.1 Policy makers are
thus foolish to believe that they can develop reputations on the basis
of their historical record for keeping or breaking commitments. This
perspective has received criticism. For one, past actions
communicate---intentionally or not---the interests that states have,
whereas situational assessments depend partly on the historical record.
2 For another, this school of thought has mischaracterized the work of
Thomas Schelling, which it has held responsible for the belief that
commitments are so interdependent that reputations for keeping
commitments are necessary for deterrence. Schelling instead argued that
past actions matter in cases where states are continuously negotiating
with each other, not in all coercive bargaining encounters.3

My findings further challenge the perspective that current, ahistorical
calculations of power and interest determine credibility. I find that in
attending to the foreign policy doctrines and conventional military
deployments of their guarantors, allies accord importance to the local
military effectiveness of their guarantors. Still, some
[[actions]{.mark} undertaken by the guarantor [can **provide
info**]{.mark}**rmation** [as to]{.mark} its **[interests]{.mark}** and
foreign policy interests, [**especially** if]{.mark} those [actions
include]{.mark} **major and [unfavorable]{.mark}** military
[redeployments]{.mark}]{.underline}. In brief, [my findings blur the
distinction between reputation]{.underline}, on the one hand, [and
current calculations like power and interest]{.underline}, on the other
hand. To be sure, I do not offer a systematic test as to the sources of
alliance credibility. I examined narrowly how abandonment fears
intensify so as to make states more likely to engage in nuclear
proliferation--related behavior. Scholars should thus focus more on
alliance credibility as a dependent variable.

NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND CONVENTIONAL MILITARY POWER

States form judgments about the security guarantees that they receive
with reference to the conventional military capabilities that their
guarantor could muster on their behalf for defense and deterrence
purposes. The reason why allies look to the conventional capabilities of
their guarantor is that they value deterrence-by- denial as much as they
do deterrence-by- punishment, if not more. Indeed, from the perspective
of allies like West Germany and especially South Korea, nuclear weapons
are partly a means for offsetting the conventional superiority of
adversaries, especially when those same adversaries possess nuclear
weapons as well.

Unfortunately, scholars separate the study of nuclear weapons from that
of conventional military power. Many studies of nuclear proliferation
simply assume that nuclear weapons represent a special category, even
though the factors that predict which states have nuclear weapons can
also predict which states would have access to fifth-generation fighter
jets, third-generation advanced tanks, ballistic missile capabilities,
and so forth.4 In social scientific parlance, these studies neglect an
important endogeneity problem, whereby conventional and nuclear weapons
systems are related to each other. States that experience unfavorable
alterations in their received security guarantees might opt for nuclear
weapons, because they cannot develop sufficient conventional military
capabilities for deterring an adversary in time. Some states, like Great
Britain and France, acquire nuclear weapons because they already have
most leading military technologies. Interestingly, the best works on
conventional deterrence and military power neglect the nuclear dimension
altogether.5 To take one example, excluding the role nuclear weapons
have played in the Arab-Israeli conflict---as John Mearsheimer has
done---could lead to mistaken understandings of how deterrence in
general succeeds.6

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COERCION

The core message of this book is that military alliances are better at
preventing nuclear proliferation than stopping it once it has started. I
have presented evidence that apparent success stories of alliance
coercion are less than what they appear. What does this finding mean
more generally for international relations scholarship?

Schelling famously wrote that compellence is harder than deterrence
because the former seeks to change the status quo, whereas the latter
seeks to maintain it. Much of the recent literature seems to support
this maxim, notwithstanding the difficulties in empirically
distinguishing deterrence from compellence.7 Drawing on data regarding
compellent threats, Todd Sechser observes that strong states have
trouble compelling weaker states because those weaker states worry that
capitulation would lead to new demands. Their very strength leads strong
states to underappreciate these reputational concerns.8 Using similar
data, Todd Sechser and Matthew Fuhrmann show that nuclear weapons rarely
confer any bargaining leverage on its possessors, since they are useless
for territorial conquest and involve high costs as tools for
punishment.9 Dianne Chamberlain finds that because using military force
has become less costly for the United States, weak adversaries discount
its threats.10 Dan Altman argues that states do not even bother with
coercion at all in making territorial gains---they grab what they want
rather than dispute a proposed territorial division in a crisis.11 Some
disagreement exists among scholars. Kyle Beardsley and Victor Asal write
that "the possession of nuclear weapons helps states to succeed in their
confrontations with other states even when they do not 'use' these
weapons," whereas Matthew Kroenig argues that nuclear superiority
confers an advantage in crisis bargaining.12

All these studies, however, focus on coercive bargaining between
adversaries rather than between allies. When scholars examine military
or nonmilitary threats that states make to their allies, the issue-area
under dispute usually revolves around nuclear proliferation.13 My case
studies show that alliance coercion in this domain is often difficult
for the United States to do effectively. That is not to say that
alliance coercion is never effective. Such a view would be sorely
mistaken. Rather, my argument is that its effect is more subtle and
indirect than commonly presumed. Still, a more general or comparative
study of intra-alliance coercion would benefit international relations
scholarship---one that encompasses other issues such as wartime
coalition participation and peacetime burden-sharing. 14 Many empirical
questions still need an answer. For example, is alliance coercion more
effective in some issue areas than in others? Why or why not?

THE NUCLEAR SOURCES OF AMERICAN PRIMACY

The case studies also suggest that to understand the preponderant role
of the United States in international politics, we should not overlook
the nuclear dimension. Unfortunately, many existing theories of
hierarchy and hegemony often view the world in largely conventional
military terms, as the books of David Lake and John Ikenberry do.15 This
oversight is problematic for the very reason that whatever one thinks of
the global military presence of the United States, it is at least partly
the product of a consistent desire to forestall nuclear proliferation.
Daniel Deudney adds that "unipolarity, to the extent it still exists, is
made much easier and more durable by nuclear weapons" because the
deterrent effects they generate help stabilize interstate relations and
inhibit encroachment and counterbalancing.16 Nuclear proliferation
undercuts hegemony because it negates American power projection
capabilities.

Claiming that nonproliferation has been as much a goal of American grand
strategy as openness and containment might be a slight overstatement,
however. 17 Sometimes other foreign policy goals get in the way---the
Kennedy administration discovered this tension when it came to value
nuclear nonproliferation while voicing its frustrations with the defense
and monetary policies of West Germany. On occasion foreign policy goals
are complementary so as to reinforce each other: quashing Taiwan's
nuclear ambitions was important for Sino-American relations. Moreover,
the United States has good reason not to enshrine nuclear
nonproliferation as an overriding priority that trumps all other foreign
policy objectives: states would have an incentive to manipulate American
interest in nonproliferation. Accordingly, despite what realists say
about the lack of a central enforcer of rules in the international
system, states would be able to "dial 911" for help by signaling some
intent to acquire nuclear weapons.18 But partly because the United
States has conflicting foreign policy interests, this option remains
problematic for allies to use.

The nuclear dimension of American global leadership might, then, be more
complicated than what seems to be the case at first glance. If the
United States views nonproliferation as a goal unto itself, then it
might be an offensive realist: that is, it uses whatever means to secure
regional---if not global---hegemony at the expense of other states.19 In
contrast, if nonproliferation is a goal that is either subordinate or
complementary to other interests, then the United States might be a
defensive realist. In other words, it might not see nuclear
proliferation as problematic per se and can in fact be open to it, but
it sometimes works hard to forestall it lest the spread of nuclear
weapons would complicate other foreign policy objectives.20

GREAT POWER MANAGEMENT OF WEAKER STATES

This book addresses how American security guarantees can forestall
nuclear proliferation. It does not investigate how the security
guarantees of other major powers---namely, the Soviet Union and
China---can affect the nuclear interest of their own security partners.

My argument has implications for understanding nuclear proliferation and
nonproliferation within non-American alliance systems. Consider first
the Soviet Union and its alliances.21 Romania was the only Warsaw Pact
member out of seven to covet nuclear weapons, whereas both East Asian
allies---China and North Korea--- made efforts to acquire nuclear
weapons in the Cold War with varying degrees of success. Despite the
contiguity of the Soviet Union with all those countries, its security
guarantees to them varied in quality. For better or for worse, none of
these countries held the Soviet geopolitical interest and hosted Soviet
armed forces to the same extent, if at all, as the industrialized
Northern Tier of the Warsaw Pact (Poland, East Germany, and
Czechoslovakia). 22 Romania might have been a member of the Warsaw Pact,
but it perceived a growing disconnect between its security interests and
those of the Kremlin between the late 1950s and early 1960s. In
particular, it did not wish to be consigned to being the soft
agricultural underbelly of the Soviet bloc.23 Moreover, the Soviet Union
accorded so much significance to its holdings in Central and Eastern
Europe that it cared less about developments in East Asia. Chinese and
North Korean leaders might have reached this conclusion in the 1950s
when the Soviet Union appeared disinterested in the fate of its
communist partners during the Korean War.24 Those countries thus
discounted Soviet support early and decided to develop nuclear weapons.
And so the dynamics outlined in this book could very well be applicable
to the Soviet context.25

My argument bears insights for how China has managed the North Korean
proliferation problem. Interestingly, North Korea began considering
whether to acquire nuclear technologies shortly after China withdrew its
forces from North Korea in 1958.26 North Korea had good reason to
discount Chinese security guarantees, formalized as they were with a
1961 mutual defense treaty. After all, China came to North Korea's aid
in the Korean War only when American-led forces approached the Yalu
River. As Jonathan Pollack writes, Pyongyang "faced four decades of
continuous nuclear threat . . . without a countervailing nuclear
retaliatory threat of its own or allied nuclear deployments on its own
territory."27

But what has China done about North Korea? A common refrain is that
China can and should do more to curb its ally's destabilizing ambitions,
especially since China is the main source of North Korea's trade, food,
arms, and energy.28 Despite how scholars sometimes argue that guarantors
seek to prevent nuclear proliferation in order to preserve their
standing and power projection capabilities, China appears exceptional in
having shielded its ally from multilateral sanctions for the most part.
One can argue that it has even free-ridden on American efforts to
restrain Taiwan and South Korea without doing much of the same toward
North Korea. However, my analysis yields two notes of caution. The first
is that China might have perceived that reversing North Korea's nuclear
program was not in China's interest, especially if China's worries about
regime stability, refugee flows, and a reunified Korea are legitimate.
The second is that experts might be overestimating China's ability to
restrain its ally, especially when North Korea has by now developed
certain missile capabilities and thermonuclear weapons. To be sure,
Beijing could have at least forbidden North Korean citizens from
receiving training in China---scientists who probably went on to
participate in advanced weapons development in their native country.29
Still, in the improbable event that North Korea renounces its nuclear
weapons, it would likely do so for non-alliance reasons.

Policy Implications

The policy implications of this study seem grim. Not only does the
denuclearization of North Korea seem fantastical, but also any move
toward acquiring nuclear weapons on the part of an ally would be
extraordinarily difficult for the United States to reverse. The policy
community should take small comfort in how American decision makers have
restrained the ambitions of South Korea, Taiwan, and West Germany. The
successes of those decision makers were at best overstated.

Yet there are upsides. One is that the United States can deter nuclear
weapons interest among its allies. [Given how **vital** strong security
guarantees are]{.underline} toward this end, [American decision makers
thankfully **have a say**. More specifically, they can **recalibrate
doctrines** and deployments so as to **shape perceptions** of
credibility]{.underline}. Ally leaders appear to refer to these metrics
in their own nuclear decision-making. We should thus remember that [[it
is]{.mark} of the **utmost [importance]{.mark}** that **American defense
[planners]{.mark}** [take]{.mark} **the [time]{.mark}** [to think
about]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[effects]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
their moves from more than just a budgetary or rational perspective.
[Having Marines in Okinawa might make **little tactical or operational
sense**, but **shifting them** thousands of miles away could **still**
be destabilizing. **[Symbols matter]{.mark}**, and they may matter
**more** from the perspective of **allies** than from the perspective of
**Washington**]{.underline}.30 Nevertheless, the symbolic nature of such
deployments should not be overstated. Allies value them because they
believe such forces can put up a fight against an adversary should
deterrence fail. In a world of anti-access and area denial (A2/ AD)
military technology, a United States that practices offshore balancing
might experience overwhelming difficulties in entering a theater of
operations so as to aid an ally under siege. An onshore presence makes
the United States look more capable and resolved to allies and
adversaries alike.31 That said, withdrawing forces unilaterally might be
counterproductive when it comes to having an ally bear a greater share
of the collective defense burden. If the ally feels threatened by a
nuclear-armed aggressor, then it might arm itself in ways that are to
the detriment of the guarantor's own interests.

Another upside is that decoupling does not make nuclear proliferation
inevitable. 32 Because North Korea is developing capabilities so that it
could strike the continental United States with nuclear weapons, some
observers fear that Washington would become less likely to defend South
Korea and Japan in order to avoid being attacked. Accordingly, those two
allies sense that their interests are becoming decoupled from that of
the United States and so would strive to secure themselves nuclear
weapons of their own. Yet this fear is overstated. For one, they have
already endured decoupling throughout the Cold War and after the Soviet
Union and China had acquired survivable second-strike capabilities. For
another, my analysis suggests that decoupling need not translate to
nuclear proliferation as long as those allies believe that the United
States would fight on their behalf and deny adversaries battlefield
success. Providing hostages for the sake of extended deterrence is
insufficient. Having aligned doctrines and in-theater deployments
capable of inflicting harm on the adversary can influence such beliefs
in a positive direction.

[**[Perceptions of cred]{.mark}ibility** [are
**malleable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but we must be careful not to
overstate idiosyncratic factors. Many analysts and experts worry that
President Donald Trump's unique style of communication can undercut
deterrence and destabilize alliance relations. For example, in an
excellent overview of his attitudes toward nuclear weapons, Jeffrey
Michaels and Heather Williams caution that his use of social media could
lead to misperceptions and miscalculations by friends and foes alike.33
According to this argument, an errant tweet would undermine American
credibility. My analysis suggests that such concerns may be slightly
exaggerated. A tweet is but one signal among many. [[Allies]{.mark} like
**South Korea** and **Poland**]{.underline} will
**[[pay]{.underline}]{.mark}** more [[**attention** to]{.mark} the
**military basis** of]{.underline} their **[received

countries **all over [the world]{.mark}** [pursuing]{.mark} their **own
[nukes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \"Trump is increasing the chances of the
bomb spreading and the key treaty keeping the lid on such proliferation
collapsing,\" says Blair.

[**Unconstrained [nuclearization]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} one
**[nightmare]{.mark} scenario**]{.underline} that is becoming
increasingly plausible as Trump escalates his criticism of the
69-year-old North Atlantic alliance. [For three quarters of a century,
**[America]{.mark}**n nukes have [made it **unnecessary** for]{.mark}
many **[Europe]{.mark}an** countries [to possess nukes]{.mark} of their
own]{.underline}.

Because of that, these countries could safely sign on to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty, bolstering international efforts to limit
nuclearization all over the world. \"Among the benefits of NATO, a key
one is that it has helped to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons,\"
Kingston Reif, an analyst with the Arms Control Association, told The
Daily Beast.

But that was long before Trump's rise as a political force. In 2017, the
former reality-T.V. star declared NATO \"obsolete.\" In Brussels on July
11, Trump again questioned the organization\'s usefulness. \"What good
is NATO?\" he asked. The next day at a meeting of NATO leaders, Trump
threatened that he might \"do his own thing\" if alliance members
didn\'t immediately increase their military spending.

Trump\'s words sent a chill through European capitals. The United States
is by far the biggest military spender in NATO and, according to Mark
Simakovsky, a fellow with the Atlantic Council\'s Eurasia Center, the
\"glue\" that holds the alliance together. \"Don\'t forget, there are
huge divisions in Europe,\" Simakovsky said.

NATO\'s 29 member states range from illiberal Turkey, Hungary and Poland
on the alliance\'s eastern flank to stalwarts France and Germany at the
heart of the continent and the restive United Kingdom in the west.

At present just two non-U.S. NATO states -- the U.K. and France --
possess nuclear weapons. France fields around 300 nukes. The U.K.,
around 215. By contrast, the United States maintains an arsenal of no
fewer than 3,800 atomic warheads, only slightly fewer than Russia
possesses. The U.S. military keeps 180 warheads in Europe for use by its
own forces and the forces of certain NATO members, most notably Germany.

[Practically speaking, America is [Europe\'s **nuclear
shield**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Under **[Article V]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the NATO charter, an
attack on any NATO state represents an attack on every other state --
and [the alliance is obligated to respond. That [applies to a]{.mark}
**nuclear [strike]{.mark}**]{.underline} as well as conventional attack.
[If Russia nuked]{.underline}, say, [Lithuania or Poland, the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [would be obligated to
nuke Russia right back]{.underline}.

That mutual nuclear threat has helped to keep the peace in Europe since
the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb in a test in 1949, the
same year as NATO\'s founding.

But with France and the U.K. possessing so few atomic warheads compared
to Russia, deterrence in Europe could begin to collapse without American
nukes. And that risk could drive European countries to create their own,
more powerful deterrents -- either collectively or individually.

[\"The [loss of]{.mark} **U.S. [reliability]{.mark}** to deter
aggression against NATO Europe would [prompt **France** and]{.mark} the
[**U.K.** to **expand**]{.mark} **their nuclear [capabilities]{.mark}**
[and **Germany**]{.mark} and other non-nuclear countries [to]{.mark}
consider **[build]{.mark}**ing their own nuclear arsenals
**[despite]{.mark} strong public [opposition]{.mark}**,\"]{.underline}
Blair said.

Some European officials are already thinking in those terms. In 2017,
Jaroslaw Kaczynski, chairman of Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party,
called for Europe to build up a combined nuclear arsenal as powerful as
Russia\'s own arsenal. Conservative German parliamentarian Roderich
Kiesewetter endorsed the idea.

If the United States were to leave NATO, Europe could build its own
deterrent under the umbrella of a diminished NATO structure, or opt for
a new structure based on the European Union. In the last decade or so,
the E.U. has begun to establish a rudimentary military organization, but
has deployed troops only rarely -- and then mostly in Africa on
peacekeeping duties.

The realignment could get complicated. Albania, Canada, Iceland, Norway
and Turkey are in NATO, but aren\'t in the E.U. Austria, Finland,
Ireland, Malta and Sweden are in the E.U., but aren\'t in NATO. Ireland,
for one, is strictly opposed to nuclear weapons. \"There are European
Union members with nuclear capabilities, but how those capabilities
would be employed outside of a NATO context -- it\'s never been fleshed
out,\" Simakovsky said.

For Trump to even threaten to pull back America\'s atomic umbrella is
dangerous, Simakovsky said. \"What it encourages is instability.\"

And that instability -- and [the **resulting [mistrust]{.mark}** between
former allies]{.underline} -- plays into the hands of Russian president
Vladimir Putin. It [could even, in the most extreme scenario, [tempt
**Putin** to launch]{.mark} his own limited **nuclear [strike]{.mark}**
in the context of a wider war in Europe]{.underline}.

In the last decade Russia has invaded two of its European neighbors --
Ukraine in 2014 and the Republic of Georgia in 2008. Neither Georgia nor
Ukraine is a full member of NATO, although both countries have signalled
their desire to join the alliance.

The Eastern European states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- all
former Soviet republics -- and Poland, formerly a Soviet satellite, are
NATO members and view themselves as the main targets of Russia\'s
aggression. This year, Russia deployed nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad, a
Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea between Poland and Lithuania.

The Trump administration criticized the Russian deployment as
\"destabilizing.\" But the greater threat of destabilization comes from
the administration itself as it continues to dismantle rhetorically a
security structure that has preserved the peace -- and deterred nuclear
war -- in Europe since 1949.

\"If Putin somehow decides to cross the nuclear threshold, it won't be
because he thinks we don't have enough nuclear weapons,\" Reif said.
\"It will be based on a political calculation that he has a greater
stake in the conflict and we and our allies won't be willing to run the
risk of escalation.\"

The alternative is only less awful. That, [in the [absence of]{.mark}
America\'s **nuclear [guarantee]{.mark}** as part of a transatlantic
alliance, Europe might build up a large nuclear arsenal of its own and
[supercharge]{.mark} **global atomic [prolif]{.mark}eration**.
\"[Nothing would do more to cause]{.mark} **nuclear [anarchy]{.mark}**
[than **wrecking NATO**]{.mark},\"]{.underline} Blair said.

**Tertrais '19** \[Bruno; July 29; Master's Degree in Public Law of the

Still, as a study conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations
(ECFR) indicates, [[there is]{.mark} a continued **[general]{.mark}
nuclear [apathy]{.mark}** [in Europe as well as]{.mark} an
[**unwillingness** "to face]{.mark} up to the renewed relevance that
nuclear [deterrence]{.mark} ought to have in their strategic
thinking.]{.underline}"43 [[The time is]{.mark} thus [**not ripe** for
**grand initiatives** that]{.mark} would [entail]{.mark} the [creation
*ex abrupto* of a]{.mark} common [deterrent, especially **as long as

it in a recent overview of the concept of "strategic autonomy:"
[["\[T\]here appears]{.mark} to be **[no Eu]{.mark}rope-wide
[willingness]{.mark}** [for a]{.mark} 'European nuclear [deterrent' **at

of autonomy would symbolize the end of the transatlantic relationship as
we know it today, pose a strategic liability for their national
security, and, for many states, violate their neutrality or
constitutions."44

#### Allied prolif [isn't inevitable]{.underline}, but the plan flips assurances.

**Lanoszka '18** \[Alexander; 2018; International Relations Professor at
the University of Waterloo; *Atomic Assurance: The Alliance Politics of
Nuclear Proliferation*, "How Alliances (Mis)Manage Nuclear
Proliferation," Chapter 1\]

Perhaps such pessimism is warranted amid the Teutonic shifts in
international politics that attend the rise of China and the apparent
decline of the United States. Yet the view that the future is unlike the
past is an overstatement. [**American security [commitments]{.mark}**
[will come under **stress**]{.mark}, just as they have in the past. The
difference may well be that the United States would not have the same
clout over its allies as before if predictions of its relative decline
are correct]{.underline}. If the United States had trouble suppressing
the nuclear interest of industrializing allies like South Korea and
Taiwan in the 1970s, then future nonproliferation efforts will be much
more hard-pressed to achieve success. [**Nevertheless**, as in the past,
[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [may]{.mark} well [continue
to hold **sufficiently strong military**]{.mark} and technological
[**capabilities** over adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 [As such,
[**allies' behavior** could **reflect** how the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [**decides to allocate** its **strategic attention**
and **military resources more so than deep structural trends**]{.mark}.
Nuclear **[prolif]{.mark}**eration [**among allies is not inevitable**,
**but the choice is for the U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates **[to

**Tertrais '19** \[Bruno; July 29; Master's Degree in Public Law of the
University of Paris; Washington Quarterly, "Will Europe Get Its Own
Bomb?," p. 48\]

But [the **[context is]{.mark} now [changing]{.mark}**. If one describes
the nuclear deterrence question [as]{.mark} a matter of [**supply** and
**demand**, things]{.mark} have [**evolved** on **both**]{.mark}
**ends**:]{.underline}

-- [[On]{.mark} the **[demand]{.mark} side**, **[Russia's]{.mark} new
[assertiveness]{.mark}** and **territorial aggression** has
**[triggered]{.mark} a [renewed interest]{.mark}** in Europe about the
means to guarantee their existence and territorial
integrity]{.underline}. This is true in particular not only for
countries that became members of NATO at the turn of the century (such
as Poland and the Baltic States) but also for EU members which are not
members of NATO (Finland and Sweden) and thus do not rely on a formal
U.S. guarantee, but worry about Russia. [The [end of]{.mark}
the]{.underline} Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces [**[(INF)]{.mark}**
treaty, [as well as]{.mark} uncertainties about]{.underline} the future
of the **[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**ian program, [tensions in [**South
Asia**, and]{.mark} **[No]{.mark}**]{.underline}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rean nuclear progress [[are]{.mark}
additional [reasons]{.mark}]{.underline} for Europe to reconsider
deterrence.

-- [[On]{.mark} the **[supply]{.mark} side**, [doubts about the]{.mark}
reliability of the [American guarantee]{.mark} to Europe [have]{.mark}
rarely [been]{.mark} as [strong]{.mark} as under the current U.S.
administration. The brutality of]{.underline} Donald [Trump's tweets,
body language and policies is unprecedented in transatlantic
relations]{.underline}. This has led many in Europe, notably in Germany,
to question the wisdom of relying solely on U.S. protection. In
parallel, the European Union has consolidated its security and defense
identity through the Lisbon treaty of 2009, and also taken more recent
steps which were made easier by the prospect of Brexit. Also in 2009,
France rejoined NATO's military structure, a move which alleviated the
suspicions of some of its partners about an alleged French intention to
build a European security entity that would compete with NATO.
Interestingly, while Paris was a leader in the European nuclear debate
of the 1990s, this time, voices in Germany have been at the forefront.2

[[Thus]{.mark}, the [**time seems ripe** for]{.mark} thinking anew about
[Europe's nuclear role]{.mark} in securing the continent]{.underline}.
This paper seek to dispel a certain intellectual and political confusion
when one reads or hears about a "European deterrent," a vague expression
which covers a range of scenarios ranging from a declared European role
for French (and possibly British) nuclear forces to a full-fledged
"common Bomb" in the hands of Europe, and sometimes including a German
nuclear program. Not all of them are realistic. [[This **depends
heavily** on **one key variable**: will the **current NATO**]{.mark}
**nuclear [arrangement continue]{.mark}** [to
exist?]{.mark}]{.underline} So this paper will proceed with two
sections---first on what could happen assuming the NATO arrangement
continues and, second what could happen if it were to break down.

## AT: Lower A5 Threshold

### 1NC

#### Russian cyber-attacks won't escalate now -- but lowering the threshold for Article V ensures NATO vulnerabilities that Russia will exploit 

**Lonergan and Moller 22** - Erica D. Lonergan is an assistant professor
in the Army Cyber Institute and a research scholar at the Saltzman
Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. Sara B.
Moller is a former Eisenhower Fellow at the NATO Defense College and
will be joining the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University
later this year (Erica and Sarah, "Opinion \| NATO's Credibility Is on

4-27-22,
<https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/04/27/nato-credibility-cyber-defense-pledge-russia-ukraine-00027829>)
//nt-sg

This equivocation is not surprising, for several reasons. [The nature of
cyberspace]{.underline} often [**confounds** unequivocal deterrence
declarations. States]{.underline} tend to [operate in cyberspace with
**plausible deniability**]{.underline}, [which can make it difficult to
rapidly ascertain responsibility for cyber incidents]{.underline}. Also,
it can be [challenging to understand the **intent** behind observed
cyber behavior, and there is often a **substantial time lag** between
when an initial penetration of a network occurs and when the target even
realizes the breach. And the vast majority of cyber operations cause
**virtual, not physical, damage**, complicating efforts to assess and
evaluate the implications of the costs inflicted.]{.underline}
Moreover[, it can take time to develop and identify a way to infiltrate
a network as well as the computer code that takes advantage of a
vulnerability for malicious ends. This means states may **lack a
palatable cyber response** option for retaliatory purposes at the
desired time.]{.underline}

[This creates a **slew of**]{.underline} practical [**problems** if
Article 5 were to be invoked for a cyberattack]{.underline}. From an
implementation perspective, [it would trigger deliberations within the
North Atlantic Council]{.underline}, NATO's primary decision-making
body. [Decisions made within the NAC require **unanimity**, which can be
difficult to achieve for many issues but is especially **burdensome**
for cyber ones, given all of the ambiguities]{.underline} outlined
above[. The most likely outcome of this process would be a]{.underline}
long, drawn-out deliberation resulting in a [**divided alliance** unable
to agree on how or whether to respond]{.underline}. Quite simply, [some
allies are unlikely to want to risk World War III for a cyberattack that
disrupts the financial infrastructure, for instance, of another country
but doesn't lead to loss of life or sustained damage.]{.underline}

[These challenges have major **strategic implications** for
NATO.]{.underline} After years of publicly and repeatedly [linking
Article 5 to cyberspace]{.underline} and reinforcing that policy in
response to the Ukraine conflict, [a failure to achieve consensus and
respond to a Russian cyberattack against a NATO member could **imperil
Article 5** in other areas.]{.underline} [The disunity that is likely to
be revealed during NAC deliberations would then undermine the broader
political cohesion]{.underline} that has, for the most part, been
remarkably strong throughout the war in Ukraine. [This would make it
more **difficult for the alliance to respond** to other forms of Russian
behavior.]{.underline} As Biden emphasized at a press conference last
month, ["the single-most important thing is for us to stay unified ...
We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly unified."]{.underline}

NATO has achieved some strategic ambiguity with its current cyber
policy, which may help to deter high-stakes Russian assaults during the
present crisis. However, [rather than an all-out Russian cyberattack, a
**far more plausible scenario** is a lower-level attack carried out by
the Russian government or a proxy group against one or more allies. In
this case, the **alliance's interests** --- not to mention transatlantic
security --- would be better served by adopting **nationally-tailored
responses** rather than pulling the Article 5 lever. Additionally, to
**prevent further escalation** and reinforce the implicit firebreak that
currently exists between cyber and conventional military operations,
NATO allies should also **agree to restrict** any retaliatory response
against Moscow to the cyber realm or non-military instruments of
power]{.underline}.

#### Russia will gradually push red-lines -- that goes nuclear

**Kulesa '18** \[Lukasz; February 2018; Research Director at the
European Leadership Network; European Leadership Network, "Envisioning a
Russia-NATO Conflict: Implications for Deterrence Stability,"
<http://www.jstor.com/stable/resrep17437>\]

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

[[Once]{.mark} a [conflict was **under way**, the "**fog of war**"
and]{.mark} **rising [unpredictability]{.mark}** [would **inevitably**
set]{.mark} in, **complicating** the implementation of any]{.underline}
predetermined theories of escalation, deescalation and inter-[conflict
management. The **actual** dynamics of]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} and the perceptions of the stakes involved [are
**extremely difficult** to predict. Simulations]{.underline} and
table-top exercises can [give]{.underline} only [limited
insights]{.underline} into the actual decision-making processes and
interactions.

Still, [[Russian]{.mark} military [theorists]{.mark}]{.underline} and
practitioners seem to **[[assume]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [a
[conflict]{.mark} with NATO [can be]{.mark} **managed** and
**[controlled]{.mark}** in a way that would bring it to a **swift end**
consistent with Russian aims. The [Russian **theory**]{.mark} **of
victory**]{.underline} would [seek to [**exploit weak points**
in]{.mark} an [Alliance]{.mark} war effort. Based on the **conviction**
that democracies are weak and]{.underline} their leaders and populations
are [risk-averse, [Russia]{.mark} may **[assume]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} its [[threats of]{.mark} **horizontal** or **vertical
[escalation]{.mark}** [could be]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly
[[effective. It would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [try to bring home the
notion]{.underline} that [it has **much higher stakes** in the
conflict]{.underline} (regime survival) [than]{.underline} a majority of
the [NATO members]{.underline} involved, [and]{.underline} thus [will be
ready to **[push]{.mark} the [boundaries]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
[conflict further. It would]{.underline} most likely [[try to]{.mark}
**test** and **[exploit]{.mark}** potential **[divisions]{.mark}**
within the Alliance, combining **selective diplomacy** and
**activation** of its intelligence assets in]{.underline} some [NATO
states]{.underline} with a degree of selectivity in terms of targets of
particular attacks.

[**[Any]{.mark}** NATO-Russia [conflict would]{.mark} **inevitably**
[have a **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [dimension]{.mark}**. The role of
**nuclear weapons** as a tool [for **escalation control**]{.mark} for
Russia has been]{.underline} thoroughly [debated by experts, but
when]{.underline} and how [Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely
showcase or activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**. Beyond]{.underline} catch phrases such as ["**escalate to
de-escalate**"]{.underline} or "escalate to win" [[there are a]{.mark}
**wider [range]{.mark}** [of options for Russian]{.mark} **nuclear
weapon [use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [[a single
**nuclear**]{.mark} **warning [shot]{.mark}** [could be lethal]{.mark}
or non-lethal. It could be directed against a]{.underline} purely
[military target or a]{.underline} military-[civilian one. [Detonation
could be]{.mark} configured for an [**EMP effect**. A "**false
flag**"]{.mark} attack is]{.underline} also [conceivable. These
options]{.underline} might be used to [**signal escalation** and could
**significantly [complicate]{.mark}** NATO's
[responses]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. [It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be **willing to escalate** the
conflict]{.underline} to achieve these goals, [and what
mechanisms]{.underline} and means [it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline} some degree of [control]{.underline} over the
conflict.

[The goals]{.underline} and methods [of waging a [conflict]{.mark} with
Russia [would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[have to be limited]{.mark}
in order [to avoid]{.mark} a **massive [nuclear exchang]{.mark}e**. Such
limitations]{.underline} would also involve restrictions on striking
back against targets on Russian territory. But too narrow an approach
[could put **too much restraint** on NATO's operations: the Russian
**regime's stability** may]{.underline} ultimately [need to be
threatened]{.underline} in order [to **force the leadership** into
**terminating** the conflict]{.underline}. NATO would thus need to
establish what a proportional self-defence response to Russian actions
would involve, and to what extent cyber operations or attacks against
military targets in quite different parts of Russia would be useful as
tools of escalation to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO
Allies, especially those directly affected by Russia's actions, might
pursue their individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of **[escalation
control]{.mark}**]{.underline} and on lessons [from the Cold
War]{.underline} confrontation [[might be **misleading**]{.mark}. The
circumstances in which a [**Russia-NATO conflict** would]{.mark} play
out would [be]{.mark} **radically different** from the 20th
century]{.underline} screenplay. Moreover, [instead of
**gradual**]{.underline} (linear) [escalation or **salami tactics**
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline} surprizing [["**leap
frog**" escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, possibly
[connected]{.underline} with actions [in **different
domains**]{.underline} (e.g. a cyberattack against critical
infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in
responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

[Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.underline} most likely [**not survive** the **first hours**
of]{.underline} an [actual conflict. [Both sides]{.mark} are capable of
**[underestimat]{.mark}ing** the **[resolve]{.mark}** of the other side
to prevail]{.underline} in a conflict [and the other side's
**willingness** to]{.underline} commit the necessary resources and
[endure the costs, especially once both]{.underline} sides [start
committing]{.underline} their [political capital]{.underline} and
resources and the casualties accumulate.

### 2NC -- Only Small Attacks Now

#### Russia only has the capacity for basic cyber-attacks

**Wolff 22** - associate professor of cybersecurity policy at The
Fletcher School at Tufts University (Josephine, "Why Russia Hasn\'t
Launched Major Cyber Attacks Since the Invasion of Ukraine," Time,
3-2-2022,
<https://time.com/6153902/russia-major-cyber-attacks-invasion-ukraine/>)
//nt-sg

But as the invasion continues with few signs of any sophisticated cyber
conflict, it [**seems less and less likely** that Russia has significant
cyber capabilities in reserve, ready to deploy if needed.]{.underline}
Instead, it begins to look like [Russia's much vaunted cyber
capabilities have been **neglected** in recent years, in favor of
developing less expensive, less effective cyber weapons that cause less
widespread damage]{.underline} and are considerably easier to contain
and defend against. For instance, [many of the cyberattacks directed at
Ukraine in the past month have been **relatively basic** distributed
denial-of-service attacks]{.underline}, in which hackers bombard
Ukrainian government websites and servers with so much online traffic
that those servers cannot respond to legitimate users and are forced
offline for some period of time. [Denial-of-service attacks can be
effective for short-term disruptions but they're **hardly** a **new or
impressive** cyber capability]{.underline}---in fact, they're what
Russia used to target Estonia more than a decade ago in 2007. Moreover,
[launching these types of attacks requires **no sophisticated technical
capabilities** or discovery of new vulnerabilities, and they typically
have fairly contained impacts on the specific, targeted
computers.]{.underline} Similarly, recent reports that Belarusian
[hackers]{.underline} are trying to phish European officials using
compromised accounts belonging to Ukrainian armed services members
suggests that [not only]{.underline} are these efforts [relying on
**fairly basic tactics**]{.underline} like phishing emails, [they are
not even being carried out by Russian military hackers
directly.]{.underline}

#### Russia lacks the talent and will for major strikes

**Lonergan et al. 22** - assistant professor in the Army Cyber Institute
and a research scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace
Studies at Columbia University (Erica D., "Putin's invasion of Ukraine
didn't rely on cyberwarfare. Here's why," WaPo, 3-7-22,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/07/putins-invasion-ukraine-didnt-rely-cyber-warfare-heres-why/>)
//nt-sg

Despite these predictions, [the expected "shock and awe" Russian cyber
campaign]{.underline} in preparation of the invasion of Ukraine **[never
emerged]{.underline}**. Moreover, while the conflict will undoubtedly
evolve, [cyber operations don't appear to be playing a decisive role on
the battlefield.]{.underline}

Surprised? We're not. Academic research explains why [cyber operations
are **poor tools** of coercion]{.underline} --- whether used
independently or as part of conventional warfighting.

What clues do earlier Russian cyber operations give?

Scholarly research details Russia's long history of cyber operations
against Ukraine. Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea included cyber
operations in parallel to kinetic ones. Distributed denial of service
attacks, for instance, strategically flooded Ukrainian networks to crash
operations. In 2015, Russia carried out a cyberattack against Ukraine's
power grid. And in 2017, Russia unleashed the data-wiping NotPetya
virus, malware that targeted Ukrainian servers initially but quickly
spread around the world.

[Yet experts who inferred from Russia's past behavior that the current
conflict would be a "Cyber Pearl Harbor" moment may have been **drawing
the wrong lesson**. There is little evidence that cyber operations
provided Russia with an operational advantage in 2014]{.underline} ---
let alone highly synchronized combined arms warfare. [And the power grid
attack]{.underline} --- in the dead of winter --- [did not cause any
deaths, and service was restored within hours.]{.underline}

[Russia's current cyber efforts have had **little impact**]{.underline}

[Many of the recent cyberattacks]{.underline} aimed to fragment the
trust Ukrainians have in their government --- and these information
operations clearly **[haven't been effective]{.underline}**. In
mid-January, Microsoft and other monitors reported that destructive
malware, "WhisperGate," was targeting Ukrainian organizations.

#### Cyber doomsday scenarios are fantastical -- states lack technical means and motive for advanced success

**Rabkin and Yoo 17** - Jeremy Rabkin is Professor of Law at George
Mason University and John Yoo is the Emanuel Heller Professor of Law at
the University of California at Berkeley (Jeremy and John, *Striking
Power*, pages 98-99, 2017) //nt-sg

There are [**good reasons** to doubt that]{.underline} even these [cyber
operations will produce]{.underline} the [nightmares]{.underline} drawn
by Richard Clarke and other alarmists. [The first obstacle is the
**scale of the technical challenge**. A hostile power cannot simply aim
a general-purpose cyber weapon at a target system. To take control of a
network, the hackers **must custom design** a special program to
penetrate the system. The developers of the cyber weapon must have a
**detailed understanding of the network**, which may take **years of
snooping** inside that system. If the target is disconnected from the
Internet,]{.underline} as the Iranian nuclear facility was, [the
attacker must infiltrate a closed local network. That]{.underline} may
prove feasible, but it [requires **highly specialized and sophisticated
intelligence**,]{.underline} so that attackers can infiltrate the target
system by way of other computers with which it may regularly interact.

[The challenge is greater still if the aim is not simply to shut down
the target system but to change its operations, as with Stuxnet. The
hackers must then **figure out how to disguise their program** to evade
detection by network security teams. The Stuxnet virus is reported to
have taken **four or five years and billions of dollars** to develop.
Among other things, the developers built their own model of the Iranian
nuclear facility.22]{.underline} Stuxnet took over the supervisory
control and data acquisition program (SCADA) of the Iranian centrifuges.
As engineers have pointed out, \"the complexity of SCADA systems is one
of the best defenses against attack,\" because their complexity would
prevent all but the most patient, expert, and highly informed hackers
from redirecting their operations.23

[To accomplish a doomsday scenario, an enemy would have to make **a huge
investment in research and development** for each individual target.
Enemies are **not likely to build models** of each mass transit system
in the U.S. to work out the right attack program for the controls on
that system. Even if they did, they could not expect that all of their
efforts would **go undetected**. If even one such attack were detected
or went off ahead of schedule, it would prompt **immediate security
checks** on other transit systems. On the other hand, regular changes in
the control systems, which might be updated for any number of reasons,
could **throw off years of preparation** by the hackers. Achieving a
simultaneous attack on a series of different targets would be an
**amazing feat of engineering and deception**. Only a **handful** of
states could spare the necessary resources to attempt such a cascade of
destruction.]{.underline}

[Apart from the technical challenge, there remains the **practical
question**: Why would an adversary want to achieve such mass destruction
effects through hacking? If the aim is to generate mass casualties,
there are more direct and reliable ways.]{.underline} A hostile state
could use ICBMs tipped with nuclear warheads to kill millions. By
exploding a nuclear weapon in the atmosphere, an enemy could generate an
electromagnetic pulse powerful enough to shut down electrical and
communications networks. Aerial bombs and cruise missiles could destroy
critical transportation nodes. Terrorists might even introduce poisons
to a city water supply or disease agents in the food chain. The more
catastrophic the desired effect of the attack, the less point there is
to deliver it through computer networks.

Alarmist observers also do not explain why deterrence would not succeed
with cyber weapons as it has with WMD. It is the announced policy of the
United States government that it stands prepared to respond with
\"military force\" to a cyber attack that causes loss of life or
substantial damage to property.24 The United States need not try to
counter each cyber attack with a comparable response in cyber space. A
cyber attack could well trigger kinetic retaliation from a wide range of
conventional weapons that could cause worse damage to an enemy regime.
Whatever one may think about the inherent logic of cyber deterrence, the
record of experience suggests that something is at work. Since September
11, 2001 terrorist attacks have killed thousands of Americans, even
within the boundaries of the United States. In the same period, [there
have been **no U.S. fatalities attributable to cyber
attacks**.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- NATO Ineffective

#### NATO will flounder when forced to act on cyber

**Ucko 10** - Adjunct fellow at the Department of War Studies at King\'s
College London (David H., \"Resetting Article 5: Toward a New
Understanding of NATO\'s Security Guarantees,\" World Politics Review,
10-26-2010,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6838/resetting-article-5-toward-a-new-understanding-of-natos-security-guarantees)//nt-sg

[The Estonian crisis demonstrated that today\'s attacks are **unlikely
to be** the **unambiguous,** military and territorial attacks imagined
during the Cold War, and that NATO, as a military alliance, **remains
ill-equipped** to operate in less-traditional domains or against
less-readily identifiable actors.]{.underline} Similar [conclusions can
be drawn from NATO\'s sole invocation of Article 5, on Sept. 12,
2001.]{.underline} NATO\'s response then centered on Operation Eagle
Assist, the deployment of Airborne Early Warning aircraft (AWACS) to
protect U.S. airspace, and Operation Active Endeavor, the deployment of
naval forces to the eastern Mediterranean \"to help detect, deter and
protect against terrorist activity.\" The alliance also pledged to share
intelligence on the terrorist threat, provide overflight rights and
access to ports and airfields as part of any retaliatory operations, and
to assist any state whose support for these measures would prove
destabilizing.

At first sight, NATO\'s response reflected an agile use of structures
and capabilities configured for Cold War-era threats. [But the first
invocation of Article 5 also illustrated the **limited relevance** of
its guarantees against less-conventional foes.]{.underline} Unlike the
Soviet Union, al-Qaida was not deterred by the threat of collective NATO
action. [Nor were NATO\'s actions following Sept. 11 effective in
punishing the transgressor or in forestalling future attacks. Indeed, it
took **nearly a month** for NATO to confirm its invocation of Article 5
and launch Active Endeavor and Eagle Assist]{.underline}, as it first
had to establish that the perpetrators of the attack were not domestic
actors within the United States. And although the AWACS that NATO
provided did free up some U.S. assets for the campaign in Afghanistan,
Operation Eagle Assist was peripheral to the broader effort against
al-Qaida and was terminated after a mere six months. The Mediterranean
operation looked good on paper, but its relation to the al-Qaida threat
was unclear, and the ships involved also operated under a limited
mandate that precluded involuntary boarding of suspicious vessels.

Some European nations did deploy special forces to Afghanistan in 2001,
yet even this response was a far cry, in terms of scale and
effectiveness, from the type of reaction associated with Article 5. By
the time the U.S. made more concrete appeals for European forces to come
stabilize \"postwar\" Afghanistan, the mood of solidarity had already
begun to wane. Having had their initial offers of assistance rebuffed by
the then-bullish Bush administration, there was not much appetite in
Europe to deploy, and the campaign basically had to be sold as another
Balkans peacekeeping operation before European troops began arriving. By
that point, the link between the Afghan campaign and the invocation of
Article 5 had already substantially eroded.

[In short, the threat and actual invocation of Article 5 **does not
deter** less-traditional adversaries and types of attack, **nor does it
provide for a swift or effective response** to these threats. As a
military alliance, NATO is ill-equipped and ill-structured to deal with
the security risks of]{.underline} terrorism, [cyber
attacks]{.underline}, political subversion and harassment (over energy
or natural resources, for instance). The [**ambiguity** of these
acts,]{.underline} whether in their origins, effects, and nature, [is
also likely to **delay NATO decision-making** and undermine the
alliance\'s resolve. As a result, the categorical response implied by
the wording of Article 5 will be]{.underline} difficult, if not
[**impossible**, to put into practice.]{.underline}

#### NATO is illequipped to handle cyber escalation

Deterrence a Paper Tiger?" Carnegie Europe, 1-31-19,

[Paper tiger? No, more **cardboard elephant**.]{.underline} Thomas
Schelling said that deterrence is the power to hurt as bargaining and
best held in reserve. [NATO has become a collective deterrent rather
than a collective defender.]{.underline} On the eve of a short but
violent war NATO would be the last place the Americans would turn to.
Rather, as NATO continued to talk deterrence, Washington would put
together a high-end coalition under its command to do the fighting.

[NATO is too **slow of thought, decision, and foot** to fight
a]{.underline} contemporary [war. The conduct of war will become far
**faster** with new technologies appearing in a **battlespace** that
will **stretch across** air, sea, land, cyber, space, information, and
knowledge. The **Russians understand this** and have built a thirty-day
"wham, bam, thank you Vlad" war machine that would **exploit NATO's
slowness** of force generation and military mobility. NATO assumes at
least thirty days of warning.]{.underline} Adaptation is thus
buttressing deterrent value by accelerating NATO's speed of response and
extending its power to hurt. NATO could fight a short war if it had the
warning, or a long war if it was given the chance. Hmmm . . .

#### Consensus ensures any Article V invocation will trigger infighting and delays

**Dunivan 15** -- Lieutenant Colonel in the US Army and Assistant

That being said, [consensus]{.underline} in and of itself [is one of the
**primary challenges** to the continued relevance of the Alliance.
Consensus within NATO **constitutes compromise** among the membership
for action.]{.underline} While the idea of consensus has always served
as a fundamental and valued principle within the Alliance, it is worth
noting that [compromise, by its very definition of agreement through
concessions or adjustment, is rarely an optimum solution.]{.underline}
Additionally, in their report to the Secretary General to inform the
development of the 2010 NATO Strategic Concept, the Group of Experts put
forth that:

[there is **an inherent tension** between a multimember organization
that works by consensus and a military/political Alliance operating in a
fluid and fast-paced security environment]{.underline}\...However, the
[need to achieve agreement\...can prove arduous, sometimes **leading to
delays** that serve no constructive purpose.]{.underline} In addition,
the Alliance needs to prepare for situations where rapid (indeed almost
instantaneous) decision-making may be required.

While the Group of Experts was correct to identify this challenge,
[there has been little to **no**]{.underline} apparent [**progress** in
streamlining the overall process of collaborative decision making for
the Alliance.]{.underline} One member of the European Union Military
Staff, another organization that has membership size and consensus
issues, commented [that it is **hard to create a shared vision** when
you have twenty-eight members sitting around the table. This combination
of real or perceived less than optimal solutions derived from a
**cumbersome and obstacle-laden process** presents challenges to the
reliability and credibility of NATO as a relevant force of
action.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Grey Zone Escalation

#### Putin will take advantage of NATO disunity to attack

//nt-sg

[\"Putin is an **opportunist**. NATO\'s disunity is the **greatest
gift** he can receive,\" says]{.underline} Riho Terras, [former
commander of the Estonian Defense Forces.]{.underline} \"German reliance
on Russian gas is a problem for those of us who share a border as it
undermines unity. Brexit might be good for the UK, but it raises
questions of a European army which would obviously be weaker than
NATO.\"

Some believe that Putin\'s greatest asset has been hysteria and
overstating of the threat he poses in some part of the West, combined
with limited pushback from powerful nations, including the US, for his
sincere hostility.

[\"Every time an opportunity appears, **he will take i**t. It happened
in **Ukraine**, it happened in **Georgia**.]{.underline} He only
understands strong messages and [if we keep showing disunity he will
respond in kind. **He is a streetfighter.** The West is trying to figure

Terras.

#### Putin will exploit any NATO weakness he can

//nt-sg

Though brutish in so many ways, [Putin]{.underline} also [is a **chess

Ukraine, [he has embarked on a gambit that aims to **force NATO to
retreat**]{.underline} from Eastern Europe, former Soviet lands that

into a scale of disunity** that allows him to reconstitute a buffer
against the West.]{.underline}

That's precisely why [any sign of a breakdown in the West's resolve
toward Kremlin aggression would be **disastrous**. The West's cohesion
is its **primary strength**.]{.underline} Whether its military and
financial support for Ukraine's democratically elected government, the
buildup of defenses on Russia's western flank, or a new regime of harsh
sanctions against Russia, [the U.S. and Europe cannot allow any
divisiveness to germinate.]{.underline}

#### Ambiguity and diversity of threats obviates attempts at cyber deterrence

//nt-sg

Why has the concept fallen out of fashion? [The existing
literature]{.underline} has certainly done a great job of
[provid]{.underline}ing [a comprehensive list of reasons why deterrence
in cyberspace is more difficult to achieve than deterrence in
conventional domains.]{.underline} [Cyberattacks are]{.underline} said
to be [**cheaper to execute**, while defense is hard. **Retaliation** in
cyberspace is]{.underline} supposedly [**harder to execute** as the
attribution of a cyberattack necessitates **time-intensive**, all-source
information, often spanning numerous networks and actors. Signaling is
**equally problematic**, given the **secrecy** of cyber operations and
the **difficulty** of discerning between offensive and defensive
behavior. Furthermore, given the **diversity** of actors in this domain,
including individuals, non-state hacking groups, and military operators,
the assumption that all actors in cyberspace act rational is **not a
given.**]{.underline}

#### Even if Article V deters conventional war -- it is ineffective to combat cyber

//nt-sg

Consequently, ideas about cyber deterrence have naturally accompanied
the growth of cyberspace and cyber operations. The disruptive and
revolutionary nature of cyber and its potential for massive effect
resembled the arrival of nuclear weapons in many ways. However, [many
theorists and strategists quickly noted the **challenges** to
reconciling cyber with ideas of classical deterrence. During the Cold
War,]{.underline} [deterrence was straightforward.]{.underline} For
example, [it was easy to know who launched an attack;]{.underline} there
was a significant scientific barrier to creating nuclear weapons; every
bomb could be as powerful as the first; [any use of a nuclear weapon
crossed an acknowledged threshold; redlines were usually grounded in
geography and easy to conceptualize; and motives were generally
discernable and tied to strategic interests.6 Almost **none of these
apply** to the world of cyber. Attribution can be **incredibly
difficult** and usually takes an inordinate amount of
time]{.underline}---if one can discern the origins of the attack at all.
The [low barrier to entry enables **many actors**, and what would deter
each actor is almost as **varied** as the actors
themselves.]{.underline} The use of a cyber weapon makes it less likely
that it will be effective in the future as defenders patch the
vulnerability. [Defining substantive thresholds and redlines is **almost
impossible**.]{.underline} Yet, despite all the barriers to effective
deterrence, most authors believe it is possible and should be pursued.
But is deterrence the right framework for approaching cyberspace?
Perhaps [the friction strategists face is indicative of the need for a
**paradigm shift**.]{.underline}

### 2nc -- only retal = war

#### Retaliation spirals and ensures conventional warfare 

**Hunt 16 -** Group Head of Information Security at Sanne (Ash,
"Tit-for-Tat: Cyber Retaliation," Info Security Magazine, 8-22-2016,
<https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/titfortat-cyber-retaliation/>)
//nt-sg

[Retaliation often **engenders escalation**]{.underline}: something that
the cyber domain facilitates with unprecedented ease. [As nation states
all-too-willingly adopt this tit-for-tat mentality, the prospect of
attacks **spilling over** the ether into the conventional domains of war
becomes **increasingly likely**]{.underline}**.**

[As Russia's revanchist activities in Ukraine show, asymmetric warfare
has already begun to rear its head]{.underline}; its efficacy and
desirability -- a potent combination of cyber and tangible force -- will
make it the norm. [Nation states should make a concerted effort to
curtail a spiraling cyber arms race and ensure cooler heads prevail.
Cyber's destructive capacity and ability to destabilize international
relationships deserves **constant policing and attention**.]{.underline}

There is a Chinese proverb; [he who seeks revenge should remember to dig
two graves]{.underline}. The international community would do well to
remember this. [When it comes to tit-for-tat, there are **no
winners**]{.underline}, only pyrrhic victories.

#### Retaliation ensures larger cyber crisis

**Libicki 13** -- management scientist at the RAND Corporation (Martin
C., "Tangled Web," RAND Review: Vol. 37, No. 1, Summer 2013,
<https://www.rand.org/pubs/corporate_pubs/CP22-2013-06.html>) //nt-sg

In their zeal to protect themselves in cyberspace, [countries need to
**ensure** that they do not **trigger even greater threats** beyond
cyberspace, particularly military or economic forms of
retaliation.]{.underline} At a time when the reported level of cyber
incidents continues to rise and when cyber risks are perceived as
growing even faster, [the odds are increasing that a country will find
itself in a cyber crisis]{.underline}. Such a crisis could take many
different forms: the escalation of tensions associated with an actual,
major cyberattack; the suspicion that such an attack has already
occurred and must be countered; or the simple fear that an attack might
soon occur and must be preempted. [Cyber crises are less likely to
emanate from the unavoidable features of cyberspace than from each
side's fear, often **exaggerated**, of what might result from its
failure to respond. To avoid the unnecessary escalation of such crises,
national cyberdefense agencies should **monitor the messages** and
signals they send out about their own cyberoperations, sharpen their
analyses of how potential adversaries would likely perceive the
escalatory aspect of offensive strategies, and **take additional
cautionary measures** to manage perceptions.]{.underline}

#### Following through with Article V commitments guarentees a disproportionate response

**Singer and Friedman 2013** -- P.W. Singer is a Strategist for the New
America Foundation and a Professor of Practice at Arizona State
University. Allan Friedman is the Director of Cybersecurity Initiatives
at National Telecommunications and Information Administration in the US
Department of Commerce (P.W. and Allan, "*Cybersecurity and Cyberwar:
What Everyone Needs to Know*," Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 137)
//nt-sg

Conversely, [making good on a threat in cyberspace can have **drastic
impacts** on international stability]{.underline}. [The full impact of
an action taken in cyberspace is **difficult to control or predict.**
Therefore, the retaliation may **spiral** beyond the intended
punishment]{.underline}, inflicting damage over and above what would be
considered a proportionate response to the breach of a threshold. [This
risks a minor incident triggering a tit-for-tat escalation and
'cascading an attack in cyberspace into a much bigger
conflict'.]{.underline} This [danger is exacerbated by the risk of
inadvertently punishing the incorrect actor.]{.underline} Incorrect
attribution could trigger unnecessary escalation with a third party
while the real aggressor goes unpunished and undeterred.

Thus, once such a cyber deterrence framework's constructed, [a state
faces the strategic dilemma of being forced to choose between
maintaining its credibility and the risks of collateral
damage]{.underline}.

### 2nc -- US retal

#### NATO countries [want]{.underline} to use OCOs to response to cyber attacks

//nt-sg

TARTU, Estonia (Reuters) - [A group of NATO allies are considering a
**more muscular response** to state-sponsored computer hackers that
could involve using cyber attacks to bring down enemy
networks]{.underline}, officials said.

[The United States, Britain, Germany, Norway, Spain, Denmark and the
Netherlands are drawing up cyber warfare principles to guide their
militaries]{.underline} on what justifies deploying cyber attack weapons
more broadly, aiming for agreement by early 2019.

[The doctrine]{.underline} could [**shift NATO's approach** from being
defensive **to confronting hackers**]{.underline} that officials say
Russia, China and North Korea use to try to undermine Western
governments and steal technology.

["There's a **change in the (NATO) mindset** to accept that computers,
just like aircraft and ships, have an offensive
capability,"]{.underline} said U.S. Navy Commander Michael Widmann at
the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, a research
center affiliated to NATO that is coordinating doctrine writing.

[Washington already has cyber weapons, such as computer code to take
down websites or shut down IT systems, and in 2011 declared that **it
would respond to hostile cyber acts**.]{.underline}

The United States, and possibly Israel, are widely believed to have been
behind "Stuxnet", a computer virus that destroyed nuclear centrifuges in
Iran in 2010. Neither has confirmed it.

[Some NATO allies believe shutting down an enemy power plant through a
cyber attack could be **more effective** than air strikes.]{.underline}

"I need to do a certain mission and I have an air asset, I also have a
cyber asset. What fits best for the me to get the effect I want?"
Widmann said.

[The 29-nation NATO alliance **recognized** **cyber as a domain of
warfare**, along with land, air and sea, in 2014,]{.underline} but has
not outlined in detail what that entails.

#### The US would have [no]{.underline} choice but to retaliate to cyber ops

**Healey 22** -- Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University\'s
School for International and Public Affairs specializing in cyber
conflict (Jason, "Preventing Cyber Escalation in Ukraine and After," War
on the Rocks, 3-9-22,
<https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/preventing-cyber-escalation-in-ukraine-and-after/>)
//nt-sg

First, [Russian offensive cyber operations might **spark a wider
war**]{.underline}. President Vladimir Putin has declared sanctions "are
akin to a declaration of war" and may see aggressive cyber attacks as
the perfect response, particularly since they are reversible and
non-lethal. Russia has been entangled with Western economies for
decades, especially in the realms of energy and finance. But now, as
ties are being severed quickly and viciously, Russia no longer has to
fear the backlash if its cyber forces were to disrupt Western banks or
liquified natural gas terminals. If you are dealt out of the game, why
not just flip the table?

Russia's cyber generals may be just as enthusiastic as their Army
counterparts. They may assure Putin their forces are ready for battle
and can quickly and bloodlessly get the West to back down. Putin could
be convinced disruptive attacks against the West are no big deal, a
low-cost signal that the West should de-escalate or just the next
natural move in a non-escalatory intelligence contest. After all, U.S.
research found that in response to cyber attacks, "Americans are less
likely to support retaliation with force" compared to a more traditional
strike.

This can lead to escalation in two ways. [The United States --- along
with countries like the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands ---
might well decide to **defend forward against such attacks**. Gen. Paul
Nakasone, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, has **insisted** his
forces "must take this fight to the enemy, just as we do in other
aspects of conflict." His then-deputy has also argued that the United
States **"cannot cede any territory"** to adversaries as the "Russians
will keep pushing until we push back on them."]{.underline}

Worse, [Dmitri Alperovitch recently warned that if Russia launches cyber
attacks after "\[h\]aving already **exhausted the power of economic
sanctions**, America and its European allies would have **few choices**
other than to respond to these attacks with offensive cyber-strikes of
their own." Such dynamics can feed a **spiraling escalation in
cyberspace** that might take on a life outside of the control of
policymakers.]{.underline}

#### The US will respond [forcefully]{.underline} to Russian cyber attacks 

**Greig 22** -- ZDNet staff writer (Jonathan, "Biden warns of US

[US President Joe Biden **responded forcefully** to reports of a
wide-ranging cyberattack]{.underline} on Ukrainian government systems
Wednesday afternoon, [telling reporters that the US **would respond**
with its own cyberattacks if Russia continues to target]{.underline}
Ukraine\'s [digital infrastructure.]{.underline}

\"The question is if it\'s something significantly short of
an\...invasion or major military forces coming across,\" Biden said in
response to a question about how the US would respond to a Russian
invasion of Ukraine.

\"For example, it\'s one thing to determine that [if they continue to
use cyber efforts, well, we can respond **the same way**, with
cyber.]{.underline}\"

The Daily Beast later asked [White House Press Secretary Jen
Psaki]{.underline}, and she [confirmed that if Russia continued to
launch cyberattacks, they would be answered with a \"**decisive,
reciprocal, and united response**.\"]{.underline}
