As Vladimir Putin made clear in his recent Victory Day speech, the war
in Ukraine will grind on for years. Even if Russia ultimately retreats,
this won't lead to a lasting peace. During the Cold War, [Western Europe
could confidently rely on American military power]{.underline} to deter
Soviet aggression. [This is no longer true]{.underline}. And [Putin and
his successors will continue to exploit]{.underline} [this
fact]{.underline} --- [unless and **[until NATO decisively
reorganizes]{.mark}** itself.]{.underline}

The United States and Europe are understandably wary of engaging in
direct conflict with Russia, but they can still do more than provide
short-term assistance to Ukraine. [**[Now is]{.mark} the [time]{.mark}**
to start taking steps to **[establish NATO as a credible force for the
defense]{.mark} [of Western]{.mark} [democracy]{.mark}** in the 21st
century. [Bold measures are required]{.mark}]{.underline}, including
dramatically revising the NATO treaty, raising an army in Europe and
even [expelling countries who have betrayed their democratic
commitments]{.underline}. But [it's the **[best way to]{.mark}
[deter]{.mark} the [Kremlin]{.mark}** and ultimately avoid more brutal
wars in the future.]{.underline}

European democracies have resisted this path in the past, but the only
realistic response to the attack on Ukraine is to construct their own
powerful army as part of a reorganized NATO. The Ukraine tragedy has
generated dramatic increases in European defense budgets, but this is
only the first step toward building a large and permanent fighting force
that could take the field against future Russian invasions of NATO
members in the Baltic --- or Finland or Sweden once they join the
alliance. While the Europeans can continue to rely on American air and
naval power, they themselves must be prepared to take the leading role
in their own defense on the ground.

This [**[won't happen unless Europeans rapidly commit]{.mark} themselves
to a concrete action plan** that [requires each NATO member to
fulfill]{.mark} strong and specific]{.underline} military
[[obligations]{.underline}]{.mark} on an annual basis. No less
important, governments must place their troops under the control of a
unified command structure. If each country sends its fighters into the
field under its own national commander, their separate forces would be
overwhelmed by coordinated Russian assaults, especially in an era of
lightning-fast weapons.

This raises a very real institution-building challenge for the
continent's political leaders. Only the European Union is in a realistic
position to organize a broad-based military effort. Its parliament is
directly elected by the citizens of all the states in the Union. After
each election, the majority of delegates choose an executive commission
--- currently led by Ursula von der Leyen --- to make key policy
decisions. This body has the precious democratic legitimacy required to
embark on such an unprecedented military initiative.

At present, however, the treaties defining the powers of the EU don't
grant the Union any war-making authority whatsoever. Before the
commission can step into the breach, another key institution --- the
Council of Ministers --- must propose revisions that empower the
commission to move forward with its rigorous demands upon the member
states.

The council consists of the chief executives of each country. But
fortunately, its current leader is Emmanuel Macron --- who staked his
presidential campaign against Marine Le Pen on an emphatically
continental vision of France's future. Many commentators have downplayed
Macron's achievement by emphasizing Le Pen's success in generating
popular support for her hard-right nationalist program. Yet the fact
remains that Macron is the first French president who has won a second
term in office in the last 20 years --- and he did so by a decisive
59-41 margin.

The French president is the continental leader with the strongest
democratic mandate to expand the EU treaties to authorize collaboration
with NATO to confront the Russian military threat. Indeed, Macron has
already stated that "\[i\]n the coming weeks, we need to bring to being
a European proposal to forge a new security and stability order. We need
to build it between Europeans, then share it with our allies in the NATO
framework."

Here is where Joe Biden can play a crucial role. He should not only
publicly encourage Macron and von der Leyen to begin the hard bargaining
required to enact the dramatic revisions to EU law required before a
European army can become a reality. Since the reorganization of NATO
also requires America's consent to treaty revisions, Biden should
immediately announce his strong support for the necessary changes.

Normally, of course, it is virtually impossible to win the two-thirds
Senate majority needed for treaty revisions. The Ukraine bloodbath,
however, has dramatically transformed the political situation. With
Macron and von der Leyen embarking on their own intensive efforts to
reconstruct NATO, Biden will be in a strong position to gain the
bipartisan support of a supermajority --- especially since the Europeans
are now prepared, at long last, to pay their fair share of the overall
defense effort. It will take a lot of hard work to develop a concrete
action program for the new continental army and assure its effective
implementation in each of the states of the European Union. If serious
efforts to lay the legal foundations don't start immediately, Europe
won't have a realistic chance of putting a fighting force on the ground
by 2030.

Even if Democrats lose control of the Senate in 2022, this will be one
of the rare issues where Capitol Hill will likely stand behind the
president. In the meantime, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his
team can offer concrete help to Macron and von der Leyen in their
ambitious campaign to gain broad-based political support for the
reconstruction of NATO on their side of the Atlantic.

Even with America's help, their success is by no means assured. At best,
it will take a year or two of wheeling-and-dealing before EU leaders can
gain the legal authority to develop a concrete action program and assure
its effective enforcement in each of the states of the European Union.
Nevertheless, there will never be a better time to make this effort ---
and if it succeeds, Putin and his successors will confront a decisive
deterrent.

In giving their strong support to the European effort, however, [Biden
and the Senate should also **[insist]{.mark} that the new [NATO]{.mark}
[remain faithful]{.mark} to its founding princi**ples]{.underline}. [In
particular, when the treaty was first signed in 1949, **NATO members
[attach]{.mark}ed a [fundamental condition to]{.mark} their [pledge of
mutual military assistance]{.mark}**. They made it clear that they
**would [come to a country's defense only if its government was
making]{.mark} a [good-faith effort to "strengthen]{.mark} their [free
institutions]{.mark}."** **[Otherwise]{.mark}, it [could not rely
on]{.mark} its [NATO]{.mark} allies to come to its defense against
attack**.]{.underline}

Seventy-five years later, it is painfully apparent that some NATO
countries are working to destroy freedom rather than strengthen it.
Turkey is the most obvious example. Over the past decade, it has been
transformed into an authoritarian state by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Worse
yet, Erdoğan sent his army to help Syria's despotic regime fight NATO's
troops --- battling against the very alliance he and his predecessors
had pledged to support. Since Turkey is neither a reliable ally nor a
defender of "free institutions," Biden and the Senate should refuse to
sign a treaty that continues to recognize it as a NATO member.

Hungary is a tougher case. Like Erdoğan, Viktor Orbán has used his time
in office to create an "illiberal democracy," which decisively
undermines NATO's founding commitment to freedom. Moreover, when he was
running for reelection during the early days of the Ukraine war, he
condemned Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, "as an enemy of the
Hungarian nation" and campaigned on a platform that opposed any EU
sanctions against Russia for its invasion. He then used his control of
the mass media to deny his opponents a fair opportunity to challenge his
celebration of Putin's aggression. As a consequence, Orbán's "landslide"
victory at the polls only dramatizes his success in entrenching his
illiberal principles into the nation's constitution.

At the very least, Biden should insist that Hungary be suspended from
NATO until it can credibly reestablish that it has dramatically changed
course and is on the way to rebuilding its "free institutions." There is
every reason to believe that the leadership in Brussels and Paris would
respond to this American initiative with enthusiasm. Indeed, von der
Leyen is already leading the commission down a rarely invoked path that
would strip Hungary of the billion-dollar EU subsidies its government
receives --- which Orbán now uses as a slush fund to sustain his
dictatorial ambitions.

The commission is also seriously considering similar steps against
Poland in response to its continuing defiance of decisions by the
European Court of Justice, which has declared that the current
government is violating fundamental principles of constitutional
democracy to which the European Union is committed. If von der Leyen
gains the necessary support to suspend Poland's voting privileges in
parliament until it complies with the court's demands, Biden should
support its suspension from the Alliance as well.

[The challenges ahead are extraordinary. But the reconstruction of NATO
not only [represents]{.mark} the **[West's best chance to prevent
future]{.mark} [Russian aggression]{.mark}**. It also **[offers]{.mark}
an [opportunity for]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and
Europe [to revitalize]{.mark}**]{.underline} the great Enlightenment
tradition of **[[liberal democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}** against the
nationalist demagogues seeking to destroy it on both sides of the
Atlantic[.]{.underline}

As Western leaders gather in Brussels this week for their annual
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} summit, the Atlantic [alliance
[faces]{.mark} a daunting set of [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}:
Middle East instability, an ongoing mission in Afghanistan and, above
all, a resurgent Russia, which has overturned Europe's security order in
Ukraine, used chemical nerve agents on British soil, and continues to
deploy instruments of hybrid warfare against the United States and other
alliance members. President Trump's repeated suggestions that NATO is
"obsolete" and freeloading on American largesse risk damping public
support for the alliance that rushed to America's aid after 9/11. These
threats are paramount. [[Often overlooked]{.mark}, however, [is]{.mark}
the **[threat]{.mark} from within: [NATO]{.mark} member governments
gradually [undermining]{.mark} their [own democratic
institution]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}, unraveling the common tie between
members of an alliance "founded on the **principles of democracy,
individual liberty and the rule of law**," and thereby
[undercutting]{.mark} it as an [effective guarantor]{.mark} of the
"freedom and security of all its members."]{.underline}

Yes, **[[NATO]{.mark} [must continue to deter]{.mark} its external
adversaries---principally [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But
[**democratic regression** among its own members **makes that task more
difficult**]{.underline}.

[In alliance states like Turkey, Hungary and Poland, the rise of
authoritarian parties by democratic means has led to
crackdowns]{.underline} on those same democratic processes that brought
them to power. Other member nations, ranging from Slovakia (where a
journalist investigating government corruption was recently
assassinated) to the Czech Republic (whose Freedom House national
democratic governance ranking declined over the past year) to the United
States itself (where Trump, the ostensible leader of the free world,
routinely lavishes praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin), exhibit
worrying trends. All have been countered to varying degrees by pushback
among civil society, the judiciary and independent media. Nonetheless,
this [**rising [illiberal tide]{.mark}** [risks]{.mark} [**exposing NATO
members** to Russian subversion]{.mark}, thereby reducing the alliance's
cohesion and effectiveness, and weakening its important post-Cold War
role as a consolidator and defender of democracy.]{.underline} While
NATO has completed several out-of-area missions in places ranging from
the Balkans to Afghanistan to Libya, many today question whether the
alliance would militarily defend one of its own member states.

This is not the first time NATO has faced democratic backsliding within
its ranks. At the alliance's creation in 1949, authoritarian Portugal
was a founding member; it would remain a dictatorship until 1974. When a
group of Greek military officers launched a coup against their
democratically elected government in 1967, NATO did not expel the
junta-led regime. Nor did the alliance move against Turkey when its
military repeatedly overthrew various civilian administrations.

Such [decisions to overlook the authoritarian character of certain NATO
members could---and were---justified as the sort of necessary
evil]{.underline} compelled by the Cold War's bipolar logic: Soviet
communism was the preeminent threat to the West and, whatever their
faults, the authoritarian regimes in Greece, Turkey and Portugal were
reliably anti-communist.

[Today, the geopolitical situation has changed dramatically. While
**[Russia]{.mark}** has reemerged as the principal ideological and
strategic adversary of the West, no longer does the Kremlin **espouse**
Marxist-Leninism but rather a **cynical illiberalism that exploits
corruption, nativism and strongman rule**]{.underline}. Moscow has gone
from being a revolutionary power to a reactionary one. But its
[[antagonism]{.mark} [toward]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and]{.mark} its [allies remains]{.mark}. The **[Kremlin]{.mark}**
**[perceives]{.mark}** Russia's **national [interest as destabilizing
Western institutions]{.mark}** like NATO and the European Union, and the
**[increasingly illiberal governments]{.mark} across the
West**]{.underline}---the sort that, during the Cold War, would have
been resolute foes of Soviet influence---[can today be **[low-hanging
fruit, ripe for Russian picking]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

That's why both of us have joined a bipartisan working group urging
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** heads of state to use their summit this
week as an opportunity to explicitly and [concretely [reaffirm]{.mark}
the **[alliance's commitment to democratic norms]{.mark}** and
institutions espoused in NATO's founding document]{.underline}, the
Washington Treaty. Such a reaffirmation will begin to [[put **pressure
on wayward member states**]{.mark} to desist in their assaults on
judicial independence, press freedom and governmental checks and
balances.]{.underline} As the president carries his message of greater
burden-sharing to Brussels, he and his counterparts [should
**[urge]{.mark} a [recommitment]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the alliance's
democratic [values]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

To reverse the democratic backsliding among its members, NATO states
will have to think creatively. One proposal suggests abandoning NATO's
consensus rule, whereby the alliance's substantial decisions require
unanimous consent, in favor of the European Union's "qualified majority"
voting mechanism. As Celeste Wallander, a former senior director for
Russia and Central Asia affairs on the National Security Council, writes
for Foreign Affairs, ["If the cohort of backsliders grows, NATO may find
itself with a bloc within the alliance bent on protecting illiberal
democracy."]{.underline} Most E.U. decisions require a "qualified
majority," the agreement of 55 percent of member states representing 65
percent of the E.U. population for a proposal to pass. If the E.U. rule
were adopted by NATO, this would allow a supermajority of alliance
states to pressure backsliding members much as the E.U. has been doing
with Poland, whose government is attempting to undermine the
independence of the country's judiciary. NATO could also allocate
greater resources to monitoring and reporting on the democratic
practices of all aspiring and current alliance members, in the same way
that another transatlantic, intergovernmental body, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, does, issuing regular reports on
electoral transparency.

Multilateral institutions alone, however, cannot solve a problem of this
magnitude; domestic forces in each member state will ultimately be their
own best defense against democratic decline. On a bilateral basis,
[**[individual]{.mark}** [NATO **governments must bolster pro-democracy
forces**]{.mark} and democratic institutions **[inside]{.mark} [other
member]{.mark} [states]{.mark}**, reemphasizing the values dimension
that undergirds what is primarily a security alliance]{.underline}. This
support could include revoking travel rights of corrupt officials,
increasing funding for independent media and [doubling down on efforts
to promote free and fair elections]{.underline}.

Since it was founded in the ashes of World War II, NATO has helped
ensure the greatest period of global peace and prosperity. It's no
exaggeration to say that NATO is the most successful military alliance
in history; not once has a member state faced the conventional invasion
of its territory. [But as [threats]{.mark} to liberal values [emerge
from within,]{.mark} **NATO's [mission of safeguarding
democracy]{.mark}** from external assault will be for **[naught if the
alliance fails to uphold democracy]{.mark} at home**.]{.underline}

if]{.underline} Putin's scared of democracy, Ukraine proves that he
doesn't have the capabilities to escalate a large-scale nuclear conflict

3 -- BUT the aff links more -- Putin's more afraid of NATO -- the plan's

NATO EXPANSION---TOWARD OR AGAINST RUSSIA?

[A]{.underline}nother [constant feature of U.S. policy toward Russia has
been the **primacy of NATO as the cornerstone** of the post--Cold War
European security architecture, including its **expansion to some of the
former Soviet states**]{.underline}. Since the end of the Cold War,
[NATO enlargement has been the **principal instrument of U.S. security
policy**]{.underline} in Europe and Eurasia. It reflects a U.S.
commitment to a whole, free, democratic, and peaceful Europe, as well as
a view that the alliance should serve as the vehicle of the continent's
post--Cold War transformation. What went largely unnoticed were Moscow's
warnings beginning in 1994 that a "whole Europe" was not compatible with
an expanding NATO, which would never be open to Russia.

[Although [NATO]{.mark}'s expansion has **not necessarily been directed
against Russia**, it has [negatively affected]{.mark} the [Kremlin's
assessment of U.S]{.mark}. motivations [and]{.mark} intentions and has
been [met with strong **objections**]{.mark}]{.underline} from Russians
[across the political spectrum. NATO [enlargement]{.mark} also has
[shaped Russia's]{.mark} perceptions of its **[own]{.mark}
[security]{.mark} requirements**, which have had a profound impact on
East-West relations]{.underline}. The issue is whether the U.S.
transatlantic commitment necessitates the alliance's continued eastward
expansion and Open Door policy.31

The Clinton administration launched NATO expansion in 1997 when it led
the alliance to offer memberships to Poland, the Czech Republic, and
Hungary---a policy that the George W. Bush and Obama administrations
subsequently embraced. In addition to extending a security umbrella to
former Soviet bloc countries, NATO membership encouraged their domestic
postcommunist transition to democracy. NATO was and remains an alliance
based on shared democratic values. And since, as Clinton declared in his
1994 State of the Union address, "democracies do not attack each other,"
the democratic transitions of new NATO members would strengthen European
security. In this way, [NATO]{.underline} also [became an instrument of
**democracy promotion**]{.underline}.32

[Russia has opposed NATO enlargement almost from the time it was raised
as a possibility]{.underline} in the early 1990s.33 [The Kremlin has
maintained that NATO's push to the east threatened Russian security and
the alliance's central role in Europe's security architecture
**marginalized Russia as a nonmember**]{.underline}. However, Russia's
objections proved insufficient to halt the alliance's expansion; most
officials and observers in the West treated such opinions as remnants of
the old Soviet ideology that Russia would shed as it transitioned to a
free market, liberal democracy. For those who did not believe that
Russia would make this transition, NATO expansion made all the more
sense as a hedge against Russia reemerging as a threat to Europe---a
prospect that loomed ever larger as Russia recovered a good measure of
its economic health, authoritarian-leaning domestic politics, and
geopolitical ambitions.34 In 2007, [Putin]{.underline} personally
[delivered an ominous warning to NATO **not to expand further
east**]{.underline}, though most in the West regarded such rhetoric as
an outdated blast from the Cold War era.35 Even though [the
[alliance]{.mark}'s **dual purpose**]{.underline}---as a defense
organization and instrument of democracy promotion---[had [emerged
as]{.mark} a **[major irritant]{.mark}** in the United States' relations
[with Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, Putin's warning effectively was
dismissed.36

In 2008, [NATO promised membership to Ukraine and Georgia, crossing the
**red line**]{.underline} that Putin had drawn around the territory of
the former Soviet states.37 In the eyes of U.S. policymakers, [NATO
was]{.underline} in effect [the **only legitimate** and **viable
security manager**]{.underline} for Europe and Eurasia, and its
expansion was the only sensible policy for the entire region.38
[[Putin's response was]{.underline}]{.mark} the 2008 [**[war]{.mark}
with Georgia**, which **[reaffirmed the red line]{.mark}**]{.underline}
around the former Soviet space, stopped NATO's eastward expansion, and
marked a major turning point in European security and in the
relationship between NATO and Russia.39 In 2014, the annexation of
Crimea and [Russia's]{.underline} undeclared [war against Ukraine
symbolized the]{.underline} end of the post--Cold War era and the
[reemergence of a new East-West divide in Europe]{.underline}.

Could this outcome have been avoided? NATO expansion undoubtedly
benefited many countries of Central and Eastern Europe, providing a
much-needed security framework for the region when it was left without
one in the aftermath of the Cold War. It also played an important role
in consolidating these former Soviet bloc countries' transition from
communism. But [one size **does not fit all**]{.underline}. Political
culture, history, geography, culture, and economic ties are crucially
important in shaping individual countries' trajectories. [The ties
between Georgia, Ukraine, and Russia---and Moscow's **strenuous
objections to NATO membership** for these former Soviet
republics---mattered little to the]{.underline} George W. [Bush
administration]{.underline} or to the president, who reportedly lobbied
for both countries to be admitted to NATO over many NATO allies' major
reservations.40

The promise of membership to Ukraine and Georgia---without a date or
plan for their accession---was made as a compromise between Bush and
many other NATO leaders, most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
who were opposed to the idea. The promise was vague and lacked concrete
details. However, it was significant as a symbol of U.S. and NATO
commitments to the policy of NATO's eastward expansion regardless of any
red lines drawn by Putin.

When [Putin spoke about the breakup of the Soviet Union as the greatest
geopolitical catastrophe]{.underline} of the twentieth century, [his
message resonated with its intended domestic audience, reflecting
**widely held opinions**]{.underline} among average Russians---a fact
overlooked by Western policymakers.41 In retrospect, these warning signs
were harbingers of future strife. [But in the prevailing atmosphere of
the West's post--Cold War **triumphalism**]{.underline}, [they were
repeatedly **dismissed** as Russia's atavistic attachment to an
outdated, obsolete past]{.underline} rather than a vision of its
future.42

With the 2008 promise of membership to Georgia and Ukraine, the United
States led NATO across an invisible but distinct line. [None of the
other Soviet bloc countries that joined NATO]{.underline} after the Cold
War [had ties to Russia comparable to those of **Ukraine** and
**Georgia**]{.underline}. The countries of Central Europe had been part
of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Poland reemerged as an independent state
after World War I and had an adversarial relationship with the Soviet
Union until it was crushed by Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler. [The
Baltic states]{.underline} had long been part of the Russian Empire, but
they [had closer ties to the German than to the Russian
world]{.underline}. Following two decades of independence, they were
forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939, and they viewed
Russia as an occupying power---a sentiment that survived Soviet
occupation and propelled them to freedom in the late 1980s, helping to
unravel the Soviet Union.

[Ukraine and Georgia share a **different history**]{.underline} with
Russia. Until 1991, [Ukraine had been part of imperial and]{.underline}
later [Soviet Russia for]{.underline} more than [**three hundred
years**. It was the empire's **industrial heartland**, home to its
defense industry and breadbasket, and a bridge to the outside world.
Georgia became a]{.underline} Russian [protectorate in 1783]{.underline}
and part of the Russian Empire in 1801. Unlike the Baltic countries,
[both were **integral parts of the Russian Empire**]{.underline} and the
Soviet Union, and although both countries gave rise to powerful
independence movements and played critical roles in the dissolution of
the USSR, [many of those ties survive]{.underline} to the present day,
[even after Russia went to war against both]{.underline} countries to
keep them in its orbit.43

NATO's 2008 pledge of eventual membership to Georgia and Ukraine was a
powerful restatement of its Open Door policy. For both countries---and
perhaps for other Soviet states harboring similar hopes---it was taken
as a Western promise to help them escape Russia's orbit. But for Russia,
[it was seen as another perilous sign of [NATO's **boundless
ambitions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [it [raised]{.mark} the
[prospect]{.mark} that [it would **lose control**]{.mark}]{.underline},
or at least immediate influence, [over two neighbors that it saw as
**critical to its security**, well-being, and prestige as a major
power.]{.underline}44 Given the alliance's commitment to spreading
democracy, [[Russia]{.mark} also [perceived its neighbors']{.mark}
intended [accession as]{.mark} a [threat to its]{.mark} **domestic
[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, the U.S. rejection of Russia's
geopolitical concerns as "atavistic" overlooked Russian sensitivities.45
Russia's response to it was an outright repudiation of several key
assumptions underpinning the original arguments for expansion---that
Russia would gradually change its views, come to share the alliance's
founding values, and eventually accept NATO's eastward push as it was
intended by its proponents; in other words, Moscow would see expansion
as a move toward Russia, rather than against it.

[Russia's [opposition to NATO's]{.mark} eastward [push **lived up
to**]{.mark} **the [expectations]{.mark}**]{.underline} of those who
argued for the expansion as a hedge against a resurgent, irredentist
Russia. However, [the [architects of]{.mark} [expansion had **not
thought through**]{.mark} **the [consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
that scenario. [Having made the promise]{.underline} of membership to
Georgia and Ukraine and encouraged their aspirations to join NATO, [the
alliance had not planned for and **did not come to their
defense**]{.underline} when the two became victims of Russian
aggression. [The [alliance]{.mark} had [made]{.mark} a [political but
not legal commitment]{.mark} to their security]{.underline}. In effect,
[[NATO chose to hide behind]{.mark} this **[narrow legalistic
interpretation of]{.mark} its [obligations]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
member states, [rather than act upon the expansive political commitments
that permeated the **official declarations**]{.underline} and speeches
of its leaders.46

In choosing inaction, [NATO reaffirmed]{.underline} what had long been
obvious to many observers---that [it was **not committed to the
two**]{.underline} countries' security. [Russia's wars against Georgia
and Ukraine demonstrated the importance of **interests as drivers of
Russian**, U.S., and NATO actions: [Russia had **more at stake**]{.mark}
**in both Georgia and Ukraine** than the United States and [NATO
and]{.mark} [was **prepared to go to war**]{.mark} to protect those
equities]{.underline}. The United States and its [NATO]{.underline}
allies [did not see their stake in Ukraine and Georgia]{.underline}, or
their commitment to shared values, [as important enough to warrant
war]{.underline} with Russia.

Moreover, in promising membership to Georgia and Ukraine to join NATO in
the first place, the leaders of the alliance seemed to overlook the
importance of geography. Even the most ardent advocates of NATO
expansion recognize now that geographic proximity to Russia has been a
powerful obstacle to realizing their aspirations of NATO membership and
the alliance's eastward push. Russia's proximity to both countries has
endowed it with a formidable military advantage, and the alliance would
face a daunting challenge in overcoming that advantage if it chose to
come to either country's defense in a conflict with Russia. That
challenge has been made abundantly clear by the ongoing discussion among
defense experts about how the alliance would be able to defend the
Baltic states in a hypothetical future conflict with Russia, given the
latter's overwhelming geographic advantages in such a conflict.47

Finally, the [[costs]{.mark} and benefits [to the alliance]{.mark} of
NATO]{.underline} enlargement, [as well as the overall geopolitical
context, [have **changed**]{.mark}]{.underline} since the early 1990s in
two fundamental ways. First, [the promise of a Europe whole, free, and
at peace]{.underline} with itself and its neighbors, which seemed within

and NATO. [Several]{.mark} countries]{.underline} that belong to neither
camp [are [now stuck in]{.mark} a **[geopolitical no man's
land]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [unwilling to return to Russia's sphere of
influence but unable to reach out to an alliance whose [promises of
protection]{.mark} are **[vague]{.mark} at best**]{.underline}. Second,
at the time of NATO's first wave of enlargement in the 1990s, the
prospect of a NATO-Russia military confrontation seemed to have been
relegated to Europe's past, and NATO was preparing to go "out of

preoccupied with augmenting capabilities to defend alliance territory
against Russian aggression. As a consequence, [the costs of opening
NATO's door to Europe's east have risen **dramatically**]{.underline}
with respect to new members and aspiring applicants. With the alliance
focused on dealing with the new division of Europe and the adversarial
relationship with Russia, [the [prospect of membership]{.mark} for
Georgia and Ukraine has been [pushed into]{.mark} a **distant**,
**[indefinite future]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
