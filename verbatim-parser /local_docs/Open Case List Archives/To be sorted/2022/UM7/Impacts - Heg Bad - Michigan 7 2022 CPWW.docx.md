Hegemonic Grand Strategy in the Context of Thucydides's Trap Alison's
work captured the attention of leaders in both Washington and Beijing.
As a confidence-building measure, China laid out the concept of 'New
Type of Great Power Relation' in 2013 based on cooperation; respect to
each other's core interests; and dialogue between Washington and
Beijing. The concept emphasizes that the United States and other
neighboring countries should respect the core interests of China, in
other words acknowledging Beijing's territorial Journal of Strategic
Security, Vol. 15, No. 2 https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol15/iss2/2
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.15.2.1983 7 claims in the East
China Sea and the South China Sea.25 The United States distanced itself
from Beijing's proposed framework as Washington realized giving
recognition to Beijing's "core interest" would tantamount to
legitimizing China's disputed territorial claims as well as giving away
lopsided concessions in East Asia.26 While United States is well within
its right to protect its interests, [China views Washington's skepticism
as arrogantly holding on to its primacy in the international system and
denying a rising China her rightful place.]{.underline} China claims
such attitude "dangerous or even irresponsible" because it can
exacerbate both countries' progress towards the apocalyptic Thucydides's
Trap, thereby, exploiting "perceptions of the trap by blaming the United
States for trying to keep China down."27 [One of the reasons for China's
ability to peddle such a narrative is due to U.S. foreign policy
stubbornly holding on to a hegemonic grand strategy even in a multipolar
world. Christopher Layne defined U.S. hegemonic grand strategy as a
"strategy of preponderance"--in simple terms--a strategy to maintain
primacy in the world through preeminent U.S. political, military, and
economic power.28 With China already an established pole, Beijing
expects Washington to share the economic-security dual leadership of the
world. The key implication here is that China's outward-facing policies
will inevitably clash with United States' preponderance or hegemonic
status. I]{.underline}n 2008, [U.S. National Intelligence Council report
argued that America should adjust its international ambitions and forgo
continued primacy in favor of accommodating the rising powers in the
interest of greater global governance.29 If the United States continues
to pursue its hegemonic grand strategy, it will accelerate the conflict
which might trigger the Thucydides's Trap. The way for the United States
to avoid the trap is neither to gravitate toward confrontation nor adopt
a passive accommodation. Rather, there should be a shift in United
States grand strategy that suits the multipolar world.]{.underline}
Realist Interpretation of China's Rise and the Likelihood of a Trap A
realist interpretation of China's rise is even more gloomy for the
future United States-China relationship. Offensive realists claim that
it makes "good strategic sense for states to gain as much power as
possible to ensure one's own survival."30 Founder of offensive realism,
John J. Mearsheimer writes, "fearful of other states, and knowing that
Goswami: Balancing Grand Strategy for America Produced by The Berkeley
Electronic Press, 2022 8 they operate in a self-help world, states
quickly realize that the best way to survive is to be especially
powerful."31 Therefore, offensive realists argue that [a rising power
like China will not stop at simply achieving 'balance of power' with
United States but turning that balance in its favor. This makes the case
for the emergence of a trap in their bilateral relationship even more
likely.]{.underline} More worryingly, leadership in Beijing have
increasingly come to believe that destiny is on their side. [After the
recent rupture of democratic norms in the United States as well her
embarrassing departure from Afghanistan and the growing desire among
American people to reduce their country's footprint in the world;
Chinese leaders are increasingly looking at America as a declining
power.]{.underline} Underestimation of America's capacity as well as her
desire to retaliate could inspire Beijing to formulate super ambitious
foreign policies regarding Taiwan or the disputed waters of South China
Sea or the East China Sea that could force the Americans to intervene
militarily. Various wargames drawn up by multiple studies in the United
States opines that a violent confrontation between [the **U.S. and
China** could **escalate** from many sources of **conflict like
Taiwan**, accidental collusion at sea, third party instigation, and
trade which ultimately leads to one destination: a **nuclear
holocaust.**]{.underline} The resurgence of China and its desire for
irredentist overreach has put U.S. in a catch-22 situation. Maintain
primacy or hegemony and it will only make Beijing more resentful towards
America, fueling further Chinese revisionism in Asia. On the other hand,
if the United States retreats from East Asia as a step towards
abandoning hegemony, Beijing could interpret it as a sign of decline of
American national power. Sensing weakness, China may next target the
post-World War international order that has been carefully built by
America and that has been so critical to preserving its national
interests. Rewriting the rules of the current international world order
to its benefit is an essential part for any aspiring hegemon and China
has always held a grudge against the current one. Critics of
Thucydides's Trap argue that war between America and China is unlikely,
either due to Chinese civilizational belief of peaceful rise and
co-existence or due to nuclear weapons that guarantees Mutually Assured
Destruction (MAD).32 There are also criticism that Thucydides Trap
promotes iron law of inevitability of war between two competing
nations.33 Rather it's the performance of leaders and dynamics of
decision-making (acting in the interest of their citizens and aided by
Journal of Strategic Security, Vol. 15, No. 2
https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol15/iss2/2 DOI:
https://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.15.2.1983 9 insights from Thucydides's
History), they say, that determines the path to an eventual war.34 There
are also arguments that these dynamics of decision-making that can
impact China and the United States' foreign policy decisions which may
trigger the Thucydides's Trap also leaves open the possibility of a
United States-China war due to psychological misperceptions. These
psychological misperceptions can be mitigated by rising powers giving
sufficiently credible cooperative signals that should remove uncertainty
about the riser's intentions in the mind of the declining state.35
However, in real world situation, credible cooperative signals rarely
fall so neatly as credible or cooperative to the declining states. In
the run up to the First World War, repeated assurances by the Germans
about its naval built-up failed to dissuade the fears of the British.
From the prism of offensive realism, British act of counter-arming the
Royal Navy is a predictable move to accumulate more power in order to
preserve its security and primacy in the open seas. Finally, there are
the optimists who totally discard the possibilities of war by claiming
that war between China and the United States is not a viable option for
both countries in formulating policy toward each other. Factors like the
huge gap of comprehensive power between China and the United States, the
close economic ties and security cooperation between China and U.S.
allies, the flourishing cultural and people-to-people exchanges among
all related countries, and the changing public attitude toward war, will
drive China and the United States to seek resolution to their disputes
by peaceful means.36 However, realist argument of relative gains does
not make for such an optimistic assessment. States pursue relative gains
over others which necessarily makes international relation a zero-sum
game in which China's gain is inevitably a loss for America. At the more
immediate future, the battle for relative gains will break out over
cornering advantages in maritime domain, cyber spying or hacking, the
shadow of A2 or AD and Air Sea Battle, and a closer strategic alignment
between competing nations.37 To that effect, changes are already
happening on ground with China pursuing aggressive maritime policies, to
which United States is responding by drawing up support from likeminded
nations to uphold the freedom of seas (Quad and AUKUS). On the other
hand, China is shoring up support in its own way by courting and coaxing
Russia and other authoritarian nations by fanning illiberal policies at
home and abroad. Beijing is also increasing its defense Goswami:
Balancing Grand Strategy for America Produced by The Berkeley Electronic
Press, 2022 10 spending to develop an Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)
plan that "entails missile, air, and sea forces capable of neutralizing
U.S. bases as far away as Guam, and searching out and destroying U.S.
naval battle groups in the region that might engage Chinese forces."38
Both sides will try to accumulate relative gains as much as possible
under the logic of offensive realism to tilt the balance of power in
their favor. Right now, the scale is tilted in favor of the United
States. However, a question begets here. If China manages to narrow the
gap in their respective national powers in future, then what will be the
reaction and response of the American leadership and people at the slow
death of their superior position in the world? Sparta had to face this
dilemma 2500 years ago, so did the British twice in early part of 20th
century and the Americans themselves for fifty long years in the
previous century. In an analysis of the last 500 years, Graham Alison
claims that out of the 16 cases of rising versus ruling power case, 12
has been settled by war. Statistics like that are quite unhelpful for
optimists.  

#### US-China war goes nuclear -- wargaming proves

science from the Ohio State University and Wasser holds an MS in foreign
service, with distinction, from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign
Service at Georgetown University, and a BA in international and global

Over Taiwan Could Go Nuclear", Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-05-20/fight-over-taiwan-could-go-nuclear)//jd 

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear war, as
Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his nuclear forces at an
elevated state of alert and has warned that any effort by outside
parties to interfere in the war would result in "consequences you have
never seen." Such saber-rattling has understandably made headlines and
drawn notice in Washington. Bu[t if China attempted to forcibly invade
Taiwan and the United States came to Taipei's aid, the threat of
escalation could outstrip even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe.]{.underline} A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a
New American Security in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027, with the aim of
examining how the United States and China might act under a certain set
of conditions. The game demonstrated that China's military modernization
and expansion of its nuclear arsenal---not to mention the importance
Beijing places on unification with Taiwan---mean that, in the real
world, [a fight between China and the United States could very well **go
nuclear.**]{.underline} Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway republic. If
the Chinese Communist Party decides to invade the island, its leaders
may not be able to accept failure without seriously harming the regime's
legitimacy. Thus, th[e CCP might be willing to take significant risks to
ensure that the conflict ends on terms that it finds acceptable. That
would mean convincing the United States and its allies that the costs of
defending Taiwan are so high that it is not worth contesting the
invasion. While China has several ways to achieve that goal, from
Beijing's perspective, using nuclear weapons may be the most effective
means to keep the United States out of the conflict.]{.underline}
GEARING FOR BATTLE China is several decades into transforming its
People's Liberation Army (PLA) into what the Chinese President Xi
Jinping has called a "world-class military" that could defeat any third
party that comes to Taiwan's defense. China's warfighting strategy,
known as "anti-access/area denial," rests on being able to project
conventional military power out several thousand miles in order to
prevent the American military, in particular, from effectively
countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, a growing nuclear
arsenal provides Beijing with coercive leverage as well as potentially
new warfighting capabilities, which could increase the risks of war and
escalation. China has historically possessed only a few hundred
ground-based nuclear weapons. But last year, nuclear scholars at the
James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the Federation of
American Scientists identified three missile silo fields under
construction in the Xinjiang region. The Financial Times reported that
China might have carried out tests of hypersonic gliders as a part of an
orbital bombardment system that could evade missile defenses and deliver
nuclear weapons to targets in the continental United States. The U.S.
Department of Defense projects that [by 2030, China will have around
**1,000 deliverable warheads**---more than triple the number it
currently possesses. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders may
believe that as early as five years from now the PLA will have made
enough conventional and nuclear gains that it could fight and win a war
to unify with Taiwan.]{.underline} A fight between China and the United
States could very well go nuclear. [Our recent war
game]{.underline}---in which members of Congress, former government
officials, and subject matter experts assumed the roles of senior
national security decision makers in China and the United
States---illustrated that a U.S.-Chinese war could escalate quickly. For
one thing, it [showed that both countries would face operational
incentives to strike military forces on the other's
territory.]{.underline} In the game, such strikes were intended to be
calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk a fine line by
attacking only military targets. [But such attacks crossed red lines for
both countries, and produced a tit-for-tat cycle of attacks that
broadened the scope and intensity of the conflict.]{.underline} For
instance, in the simulation, China launched a preemptive attack against
key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region. The attacks targeted Guam, in
particular, because it is a forward operating base critical to U.S.
military operations in Asia, and because since it is a territory, and
not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed striking it as less escalatory
than attacking other possible targets. In response, the United States
targeted Chinese military ships in ports and surrounding facilities, but
refrained from other attacks on the Chinese mainland. Nevertheless, both
sides perceived these strikes as attacks on their home territory,
crossing an important threshold. Instead of mirror-imaging their own
concerns about attacks on their territory, each side justified the
initial blows as military necessities that were limited in nature and
would be seen by the other as such. Responses to the initial strikes
only escalated things further as the U.S. team responded to China's
moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the Chinese team
responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in Hawaii. A NEW
ERA [One particularly alarming finding from the war game is that **China
found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start in order to
ward off outside support for Taiwan.**]{.underline} This threat was
repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland China had been
attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would
back down from the fight received greater attention by the China team
than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But [China had difficulty convincing
the United States that its nuclear threats were credible.]{.underline}
In real life, China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear
posture and readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear
threats may not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no
first use, its smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of
experience making nuclear threats. [This may push China to preemptively
detonate a nuclear weapon to reinforce the credibility of its warning.
China might also resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because
of constraints on its long-range conventional strike
capabilities.]{.underline} Five years from now, the PLA still will have
a very limited ability to launch conventional attacks beyond locations
in the "second island chain" in the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau.
[Unable to strike the U.S. homeland with conventional weapons, China
would struggle to impose costs on the American people.]{.underline} Up
until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team felt its larger nuclear
arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and did not fully appreciate
the seriousness of China's threats. As a result, China felt it needed to
escalate significantly to send a message that the U.S. homeland could be
at risk if Washington did not back down. Despite China's stated
"no-first use" nuclear policy, [the war game resulted in Beijing
detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii as a
demonstration.]{.underline} The attack caused relatively little
destruction, as the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics
of ships in the immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S.
state. The war game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is
likely that the first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would
have provoked a response. The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in
a fight between the United States and China are different from those
that were most likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the
United States feared a massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which
would precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange[. In a confrontation
over Taiwan, however, Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more
limited way to signal resolve or to improve its chances of winning on
the battlefield.]{.underline} It is unclear how a war would proceed
after that kind of limited nuclear use and whether the United States
could de-escalate the situation while still achieving its objectives.

Revisiting the 1980s' Debate on American Decline: The ''Declinists''
Were Right Of course, [this is not the first time that the United States
has been gripped by fear of decline.]{.underline}5 In the 1980s, Paul
Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers triggered an intense but
brief debate about whether America's power was in relative decline
(Kennedy 1987). In arguing that the United States was experiencing the
relative decline of its economic power, Kennedy was not alone. Other
prominent scholars making this case included Chace (1981), Calleo
(1982), Gilpin (1987), and Huntington (1988b). The Rise and Fall of the
Great Powers reso- nated because it dovetailed with popular fears that
the United States, enervated by the costs of the Cold War, was being
surpassed economically by Japan and West Germany. While Kennedy's thesis
struck a chord with the public, the US foreign policy elite lashed out
at the notion that the United States was declining. Two leading
establishment scholars, Harvard profes- sors Samuel P. Huntington and
Joseph S. Nye, Jr., went so far as to label Kennedy and the others as
''dec- linists''---a subtle twist of the English language imply- ing
that they were advocates of US decline rather than dispassionate
analysts of what they regarded as worrisome trends in the United States'
great-power trajectory (Nye 1991; Huntington 1988a).6 Contrary to the
way their argument was portrayed by many of their critics, the 1980s
declinists did not claim either that the United States already had
declined steeply, or that it soon would undergo a rapid, catastrophic
decline. Rather, they pointed to domestic and economic drivers that were
in play and which, over time, would cause American economic power to
decline relatively and produce a shift in global distribution of power.
The declinists con- tended that the **[United States was afflicted by a
slow---''termite''---decline caused by fundamental structural weaknesses
in the American economy.]{.underline}**7 Kennedy himself was explicitly
looking ahead to the effects this termite decline would have on United
States' world role in the early twenty-first century. As he wrote, ''The
task facing American statesman over the next decades. .. is to recognize
that broad trends are under way, and that there is a need to 'manage'
affairs so that the relative erosion of the United States' position
takes place slowly and smoothly, and is not accelerated by policies
which bring merely short-term advantage but longer-term disadvantage''
(Kennedy 1987:534; my emphasis). When one goes back and re-reads what
the 1980s declinists pinpointed as the drivers of American decline,
their analyses look farsighted because the same drivers of economic
decline are at the center of debate today: too much consumption and not
enough savings; persistent trade and current account deficits; chronic
federal budget deficits and a mount- ing national debt; and
de-industrialization. **[Over time]{.underline}**, 1980s declinists
said, **[the United States' goals of geopolitical dominance and economic
prosperity would collide.]{.underline}** Today, their warnings seem
eerily pre- scient. Robert Gilpin's 1987 description of America's
economic and grand strategic plight could just as easily describe the
United States after the Great Recession: **[With a decreased rate of
economic growth and a low rate of national savings, the United States
was living and defending commitments far beyond its means. In order to
bring its commitments and power back into balance once again, the United
States would one day have to cut back]{.underline}** further on its
overseas commitments, reduce the American standard of liv- ing, or
decrease domestic productive investment even more than it already had.
In the meantime, **[American hegemony was threatened by a potentially
devastating fiscal crisis.]{.underline}** (Gilpin 1987:347--348) In the
Great Recession's wake---doubly so since it is far from clear that
either the United States or glo- bal economies are out of the
woods---[the United States now is facing the dilemmas that Gilpin and
the other declinists warned about.]{.underline} Counterfactual
questions---''What would have hap- pened if?''---are difficult to
answer. Nevertheless, it is useful to ask where the United States might
be today had the warnings of the ''declinists'' been heeded. Perhaps the
United States would have taken corrective economic and fiscal steps two
decades ago that would have ameliorated the crisis in which it now finds
itself. However, the debate about US decline ended abruptly when, in
short order, the United States' main geopolitical and economic riv-
als---the Soviet Union and Japan, respectively---expe- rienced dramatic
reversals of fortune. The Soviet Union unraveled, and in the early 1990s
Japan's eco- nomic bubble burst, plunging it into a cycle of defla- tion
and low growth from which, two decades later, it has yet to recover.
Seemingly overnight the threats to the United States' military and
economic suprem- acy were removed from the international chessboard. The
1990s subsequently witnessed a euphoric American triumphalism that wiped
away any thoughts of US decline. On the contrary, **[the ''unipolar
moment'']{.underline}** and the ''end of history''---along with the
emergence of the so-called Washington consen- sus---**[seemed to confirm
that both America's power and its ideology were
unchallengeable]{.underline}** in the post- Cold War world (Fukuyama
1989; Krauthammer 1990--1991). **[The Great Recession has put paid to
such fantasies and put the spotlight on the domestic drivers of American
decline.]{.underline}** Domestic Drivers of American Decline: Debt,
Deficits, and the Dollar's Uncertain Future **[China's rise is one
powerful indicator of America's relative decline. The United States'
mounting economic and fiscal problems]{.underline}**---evidenced in
summer 2011 by the debt ceiling debacle and Standard & Poors' down-
grading of US Treasury bonds---**[are another. There are two closely
interconnected aspects of the United States' domestic difficulties that
merit special attention: the spiraling US national debt and deepening
doubts about the dollar's future role as the international economy's
reserve currency.]{.underline}** Between now and 2025, the looming debt
and dollar crises almost certainly will compel the United States to
retrench strategically, and to begin scaling back its overseas military
commitments. The causes of the looming US fiscal crisis are com- plex.
For understanding, a good starting point is the late political scientist
Arnold Wolfers' observation that modern great powers must be both
national security states and welfare states (Wolfers 1952). States must
provide both guns---the military capabili- ties needed to defend and
advance their external interests---and butter, ensuring prosperity and
sup- plying needed public goods (education, health care, pensions).
Since World War II, the United States has pretty much been able to avoid
making difficult ''guns or butter'' decisions precisely because of its
hegemonic role in the international economy. The dollar's role as the
international system's reserve currency allows the United States to live
beyond its means in ways that other nations cannot. As long as others
believe that the United States will repay its debts, and that
uncontrollable inflation will not dilute the dollar's value, the United
States can finance its external ambitions (''guns'') and domes- tic
social and economic programs (''butter'') by bor- rowing money from
foreigners. As Figure 4 shows, this is what the United States has had to
do since the early 1980s when it started running a chronic current
account deficit. As Figure 5 illustrates, [the majority of US government
debt is owed to foreign, not domestic, investors]{.underline}, and China
is the United States government's largest creditor. Following the Great
Recession, it has become increasingly apparent that [unless dramatic
measures to reign-in federal spending are implemented, by the end of
this decade there will be serious ques- tions about the United States'
ability to repay its debts and control inflation.]{.underline}8 The
causes of mounting US indebtedness are many. [One is the Great Reces-
sion, which caused the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve to
inject a massive amount of dollars into the economy]{.underline}, in the
form of stimulus spending, bail-outs, and ''quantitative easing,'' to
avert a replay of the Great Depression of the 1930s. A longer-term cause
is the mounting costs of entitle- ment programs like Medicare, Social
Security, and Medicaid---costs which will escalate because of the aging
of the ''Baby Boomer'' generation. **[Another factor is the cost of
wars]{.underline}** in Iraq and Afghanistan, which have been [**financed
by borrowing from abroad rather than raising taxes to pay for them.**
These wars have been expensive.]{.underline} Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel
lau- reate in economics, and his coauthor Linda Bilmess have calculated
that the ultimate direct and indirect costs of the Iraq war will amount
to \$3 trillion (Sti- glitz and Bilmiss 2008). No similar study has as
yet been done of the Afghanistan war's costs. However, [the United
States currently is expending about \$110--120 billion annually to fight
there]{.underline}, and fiscal considerations played a major role in the
Obama administration's decision to begin drawing down US forces in
Afghanistan (Woodward 2010; Cooper 2011). **[Because of the combined
costs of federal govern- ment expenditures]{.underline}**---on stimulus,
defense, Iraq and Afghanistan, and entitlements---**[in 2009 the
Congres- sional Budget Office forecast that the United States will run
unsustainable annual budget deficits of \$1 trillion or more until at
least the end of this decade]{.underline}**, and observed that,
**[''Even if the recovery occurs as projected and the stimulus bill is
allowed to expire, the country will face the highest debt ⁄ GDP ratio in
50 years and an increasingly urgent and unsustain- able fiscal
problem'']{.underline}** (CBO 2009:13). In a subse- quent 2010 report,
the CBO noted that if the United States stays on its current fiscal
trajectory, the ratio of US government debt to GDP will be 100% by 2020
(CBO 2010). Economists regard a 100% debt-to-GDP ratio as critical
indicator that a state will default on its financial obligations. In an
even less sanguine 2011 analysis, the International Monetary Fund
forecast that the United States will hit the 100% debt-to-GDP ratio in
2016 (IMF 2011). If these estimates are correct, over the next decade
the grow- ing US national debt---and the budget deficits that fuel
it---could imperil the dollar by undermining for- eign investors'
confidence in the United States' abil- ity to repay its debts and keep
inflation in check. This is important because, for the foreseeable
future, **[the United States will depend on capital inflows from
abroad]{.underline}** both to finance its deficit spending and private
consumption and **[to maintain the dollar's position as the
international]{.underline}** economic system's [**reserve currency.**
America's geopolitical preeminence hinges on the dollar's reserve
currency role. If the dollar loses that status, US hegemony will
literally be unaffordable.]{.underline} The dollar's reserve currency
status has, in effect, been a very special kind of ''credit card.'' It
is spe- cial because the United States does not have to earn the money
to pay its bills. Rather, when the bills come due, the United States
borrows funds from abroad and ⁄ or prints money to pay them. The Uni-
ted States can get away with this and live beyond its means, spending
with little restraint on maintaining its military dominance, preserving
costly domestic entitlements, and indulging in conspicuous private
consumption, as long as foreigners are willing to lend it money
(primarily by purchasing Treasury bonds). [Without the use of the
''credit card'' provided by the dollar's reserve currency status, the
United States would have to pay for its extravagant external and
internal ambitions by raising taxes and interest rates]{.underline}, and
by consuming less and saving more; or, tightening its belt and
dramatically reduc- ing its military and domestic expenditures. In other
words, the United States would have to learn to live within its means.9
As a leading expert on interna- tional economic affairs observed just
before the Great Recession kicked in, the dollar's vulnerability
''presents potentially significant and underappreci- ated restraints
upon contemporary American politi- cal and military predominance''
(Kirshner 2008). Although doubts about the dollar's long-term health
predated the Great Recession, the events of 2007--2009 have amplified
them in two key respects (Helleiner 2008; Kirshner 2008). First, the
other big players in the international economy now are either
geopolitical rivals like China or ambiguous ''allies'' like Europe,
which has its own ambitions and no longer requires US protection from
the now- vanished Soviet threat. Second, [the dollar faces an uncertain
future because of concerns that its value will diminish over
time.]{.underline} Indeed, China, which has vast holdings of American
assets (more than \$2 tril- lion), is worried that America's fiscal
incontinence will leave Beijing holding the bag with huge amounts of
depreciated dollars. China's vote of no confidence in the dollar's
future is reflected in its calls to create a new reserve currency to
replace the dollar, the ren- minbi's gradual ''internationalization,''
and in the lectures China's leaders regularly deliver telling Washington
to get its fiscal house in order. Alarm bells about the dollar's
uncertain status now are ringing. In April 2011, Standard & Poor's
warned that in the coming years there is a one-in-three chance that the
United States' triple A credit rating could be reduced if Washington
fails to solve the fis- cal crisis---and in August 2011 S& P did
downgrade the US credit rating to AA. In June 2011, the IMF said that
unless the United States enacts a credible plan to reign in its annual
deficits and accumulating national debt, it could face a sovereign risk
crisis in the next several years. In a May 2011 report, the World Bank
declared that the dollar probably will lose its status as the primary
reserve currency by 2025 (World Bank 2011). In the coming years, the
United States will have to defend the dollar by reassuring foreign
lenders (read: China) both that there will be no runaway inflation and
that it can pay its debts. This will require some combination of budget
cuts, entitle- ments reductions, tax increases, and interest-rate hikes.
Because exclusive reliance on the last two options could choke off
growth, there will be strong pressure to slash the federal budget in
order to hold down taxes and interest rates. It will be almost
impossible to make meaningful cuts in federal spending without deep
reductions in defense expen- ditures (and entitlements), because, as
Figure 6 shows, that is where the money is. With US defense spending
currently at such high levels, domestic political pressures to make
steep cuts in defense spending are bound to increase. As the Cornell
international political economist Jona- than Kirshner puts it, the
absolute size of US defense expenditures is ''more likely to be decisive
in the future when the U.S. is under pressure to make real choices about
taxes and spending. When borrowing becomes more difficult, and
adjustment more difficult to postpone, choices must be made between
raising taxes, cutting non-defense spending, and cutting defense
spending'' (Kirshner 2008:431). In the spring of 2011, the Obama
administration proposed to cut US defense spending by \$400 mil- lion
over eleven years. But that is a drop in the bucket, and cuts of a much
larger magnitude almost certainly will be needed.10 Big defense cuts
mean that **[during the next ten to fifteen years, the United States
will be compelled to scale back its overseas military
commitments.]{.underline}** This will have two conse- quences. First, as
the United States spends less on defense, [China (and other new great
powers) will be able to close the military power gap with the United
States. Second, the United States' ability to act as a regional
stabilizer and a guardian of the global commons will
diminish.]{.underline} In this respect, America's fiscal crisis and the
dollar's uncertain future are important drivers of American decline. The
End of the Pax Americana US decline has profound implications for the
future of international politics. Hegemonic stability theory holds that
an open international economic system requires a single hegemonic power
to perform critical military and economic tasks. Militarily, the hegemon
is responsible for stabilizing key regions and for guarding the global
commons (Posen 2003). Econom- ically, the hegemon provides public goods
by opening its domestic market to other states, supplying liquidity for
the global economy, and providing a reserve cur- rency (Kindelberger
1973; Gilpin 1975). **[As US power continues to decline over the next
ten to fifteen years, the United States will be progressively unable to
discharge these hegemonic tasks.]{.underline}** The United States still
wields preponderant military power. However, as discussed above, in the
next ten to fifteen years the looming fiscal crisis will compel
Washington to retrench strategically. [As the United States' military
power diminishes, its ability to com- mand the commons and act as a
hegemonic stabilizer will be compromised.]{.underline} The end of the
United States' role as a military hegemon is still over horizon. How-
ever, [the Great Recession has made it evident that the United States no
longer is an economic hegemon. **An economic hegemon is supposed to
solve global economic crises, not cause them. However, it was the
freezing-up of the US financial system triggered by the sub-prime
mortgage crisis that plunged the world into economic
crisis.**]{.underline} **[The hegemon is sup- posed to be the lender of
last resort in the interna- tional economy. The United States, however,
has become the borrower of first resort---the world's largest debtor.
When the global economy falters, the economic hegemon is supposed to
take responsibil- ity for kick-starting recovery by purchasing other
nations' goods. From World War II's end until the Great Recession, the
international economy looked to the United States as the locomotive of
global eco- nomic growth. As the world's largest market since 1945,
America's willingness to consume foreign goods has been the firewall
against global economic downturns.]{.underline}** This is not what
happened during the Great Recession, however. The US economy proved too
infirm to lead the global economy back to health. Others---notably a
rising China---had to step up to the plate to do so. **[The United
States' inability to gal- vanize global recovery demonstrates that in
key respects it no longer is capable of acting as an eco- nomic
hegemon.]{.underline}** Indeed, President Barak Obama conceded as much
at the April 2009 G-20 meeting in London, where he acknowledged the
United States is no longer able to be the world's consumer of last
resort, and that the world needs to look to China (and India and other
emerging market states) to be the motors of global recovery. Other
recent exam- ples of how relative decline and loss of economic hegemony
have eroded Washington's ''agenda set- ting'' capacity in international
economic manage- ment include the US failure to achieve global economic
re-balancing by compelling China to reva- lue the renminbi, and its
defeat in the 2009--2010 ''austerity versus stimulus'' debate with
Europe.

The conclusions reached in this thesis demonstrate how **[economic
considerations]{.underline}** within states can **[figure]{.underline}**
prominently **[into]{.underline}** the calculus for **[future
conflicts.]{.underline}** The findings also suggest that **[security
issues with economic]{.underline}** or financial **[underpinnings will
transcend classical determinants of war and conflict]{.underline}**, and
change the manner by which rival states engage in hostile acts toward
one another. The research shows that **[security concerns]{.underline}**
emanating from economic uncertainty and the inherent vulnerabilities
within global financial markets will **[present new challenges for
national security]{.underline}**, and provide developing states new
asymmetric options for balancing against stronger states. [The security
areas]{.underline}, identified in the proceeding chapters, [are likely
to mature into global security threats in the immediate
future.]{.underline} As the case study on South Korea suggest, the
overlapping [security issues]{.underline} associated with economic
decline and reduced military spending by the United States will affect
allied confidence in America's security guarantees. The study shows that
this outcome could [cause regional instability]{.underline} or
realignments of strategic partnerships in the Asia-pacific region with
ramifications for U.S. national security. [Rival states]{.underline} and
non-state groups may also [become emboldened to challenge America's
status in the unipolar international system.]{.underline} The potential
risks associated with stolen or loose WMD, resulting from poor security,
can also pose a threat to U.S. national security. The case study on
Pakistan, Syria and North Korea show how financial constraints affect
weapons security making weapons vulnerable to theft, and how financial
factors can influence WMD proliferation by contributing to the
motivating factors behind a trusted insider's decision to sell weapons
technology. **[The inherent vulnerabilities within the global financial
markets will provide terrorists' organizations and other non-state
groups, who object to the current international system or distribution
of power, with opportunities to disrupt global finance and perhaps
weaken America's status.]{.underline}** A more ominous threat originates
from states intent on increasing diversification of foreign currency
holdings, establishing alternatives to the dollar for international
trade, or **[engaging financial warfare against the United
States.]{.underline}** The importance of this paradigm [shift in U.S.
national security]{.underline}, which places new emphasis on the causal
relationships between economics and global security threats, will
[require innovative strategies.]{.underline}

### 1NC\-\-- Indo-Pak War

#### Root case of Indo-Pak War is US hegemony

In the post-Cold War period, the US role in imparting or implanting
democracy has got a big boost. Following the disintegration of the USSR,
the USA had successfully mobilized the Eastern European countries into
adopting a liberal--democratic regime. However, what followed in these
countries has been a phenomenal upsurge of violence, upheaval, political
instability, economic backwardness as well as conflicts based on
ethnicity, race, tribe and culture. In other words, the US role in
post-conflict transformation has been pretty dismal. Further, in the
immediate aftermath of withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the USA
had successfully imposed a puppet democratic regime under the leadership
of Hamid Karzai. Moreover, while the Soviet forces left Afghanistan, Al
Qaeda and Taliban stayed back and pose a scathing challenge to the West,
and especially the USA. The 9/11 in the USA and 7/7 bombings in London
have compelled the USA to pursue its 'War on Terror' with greater
enthusiasm. [Afghanistan and Sri Lanka are at the stages of conflict
transformation, whereas we can argue that the most intractable conflict,
**the Indo-Pak dispute,** operates on the plane of conflict prevention
and conflict resolution.]{.underline} [The democratic churnings of the
Arab Spring are primarily aimed at promoting democracy by the mighty
hyper-power the USA. Moreover, **the USA has now become the world's sole
policeman**. The USA has not performed its reconstruction programme in
any of these countries with any zeal. Thus, the **USA has failed in the
post-conflict transformation project in every nook and corner of the
world**, be it Somalia, Rwanda, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and, more
recently, in Darfur (Sudan). The crisis in Ukraine represents a 'New
Cold War' between the USA and Russia that is being played out in the
contemporary world. Varun Sahni, in a 2004 article, has aptly pointed
out **the nature of US hegemony:**]{.underline} We can see in this part
of the world [US forces performing the entire range of tasks that
'imperial powers' have performed through recorded history: to
**conquer** (Iraq), to **deter** (the Pacific Fleet, American forces in
Japan and South Korea, and American strategic bombers on Guam), to
**punish** (Afghanistan) and to **police** (Iraq)]{.underline}. [The
policing function, which would require the conversion of a significant
part of US military capability into an imperial constabulary, is the
only one that the American forces are not performing well. It is
therefore, perfectly logical that Washington is keen to subcontract this
vital military task to other states]{.underline}. (Sahni, 2004, p. 248)

#### Indo-Pak nuke production increasing- extinction in multiple ways

A [nuclear war between India and Pakistan could, over the span of less
than a week, kill 50-125 million]{.underline} people \-- [more than the
death toll]{.underline} during all six years [of World War
II]{.underline}, according to new research. A new study conducted by
researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder and Rutgers
University examines how such a hypothetical [future conflict would
have]{.underline} [consequences that could ripple across the
globe.]{.underline} Today, India and Pakistan each [have about 150
nuclear warheads]{.underline} at their disposal, and that number is
expected to [climb to more than 200 by 2025.]{.underline} The picture is
grim. That level of warfare wouldn\'t just kill millions of people
locally, said CU Boulder\'s Brian Toon, who led the research published
today in the journal Science Advances. It might also [plunge the entire
planet into a severe cold spell, possibly with temperatures not seen
since the last Ice Age.]{.underline} His team\'s findings come as
tensions are again simmering between India and Pakistan. In August,
India made a change to its constitution that stripped rights from people
living in the long-contested region of Kashmir. Soon after, the nation
sent troops to Kashmir, moves that Pakistan criticized sharply. \"An
India-Pakistan war could double the normal death rate in the world,\"
said Toon, a professor in the Laboratory of Atmospheric and Space
Physics. \"[This is a war that would have no precedent in human
experience.\"]{.underline} It\'s a subject that Toon, also of the
Department of Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences, has had on his mind for
decades. He came of age during the height of the Cold War when
schoolchildren still practiced ducking-and-covering under their desks.
As a young atmospheric scientist in the early 1980s, he was part of a
group of researchers who first coined the term \"nuclear winter\" \-- a
period of extreme cold that would likely follow a large-scale nuclear
barrage between the U.S. and Russia. Toon believes that such weapons are
still very much a threat \-- one that\'s underscored by current
hostilities between India and Pakistan. \"They\'re rapidly building up
their arsenals,\" Toon said. \"They have huge populations, so lots of
people are threatened by these arsenals, and then there\'s the
unresolved conflict over Kashmir.\" In his latest study, Toon and his
colleagues wanted to find out just how bad such a conflict could get. To
do that, the team drew on a wide range of evidence, from computer
simulations of Earth\'s atmosphere to accounts of the bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in 1945. Based on their analysis, the
devastation would come in several stages. In the first week of the
conflict, the group reports that India and Pakistan combined could
successfully detonate about 250 nuclear warheads over each other\'s
cities. There\'s no way to know how powerful these weapons would be \--
neither nation has conducted nuclear tests in decades \-- but the
researchers estimated that each one could kill as many as 700,000
people. Most of those people wouldn\'t die from the blasts themselves,
however, but from the out-of-control fires that would follow. \"If you
look at Hiroshima after the bomb fell, you can see a huge field of
rubble about a mile wide,\" Toon said. \"It wasn\'t the result of the
bomb. It was the result of the fire.\" For the rest of the globe, the
fires would just be the beginning. [The researchers calculated that an
India-Pakistan war could inject as much as 80 billion pounds of thick,
black smoke into Earth\'s atmosphere.]{.underline} That smoke would
[block sunlight from reaching the ground]{.underline}, [driving
temperatures around the world down]{.underline} by an average of between
3.5-9 degrees Fahrenheit for several years. [Worldwide food shortages
would likely come soon after.]{.underline}

#### American hegemony entrap it into an Iran-Israel conflict

accessed 7/5/22)//jd

Israel and Iran aren't yet on the verge of a major escalation or war,
and continued progress on the Iran nuclear talks in Vienna would likely
forestall one, if Israel judges that trying to undermine a deal would
exact too great a cost in its relations with Washington. But [the
factors that might well produce a significant blowup are now aligning in
frightening fashion.]{.underline} [An April 11 explosion at the Natanz
nuclear facility---presumed to be the work of Israel---was a dramatic
salvo in the shadow war over Iran's nuclear program.]{.underline} In
response to the attack, [Iran ramped up its enrichment
capacity]{.underline}. An errant Syrian missile landed near Dimona in
Israel on April 22, and Israel struck back at the launch site in Syria.
[Such chains of events risk escalating, even unintentionally, to open
conflict]{.underline}. The Biden administration, understandably
preoccupied with the politics of domestic recovery, has expressed its
intention to reenter the 2015 Iran nuclear deal but appears to be in no
particular hurry to do so. Yet [without intensified U.S. diplomacy
designed to restrain both Israel and Iran, the administration could
easily find itself drawn into a conflict it neither wants nor needs and
that undermines its real priorities at home]{.underline}. A FRUSTRATED
IRAN Briefing Congress on April 14, Director of National Intelligence
Avril Haines identified Iran as one of the four top threats facing the
United States. She noted, "We expect that Iran will take risks that
could escalate tensions and threaten U.S. and allied interests in the
coming year." That assessment rises in part from Iran's growing
frustrations at home and abroad. Sanctions have devastated the Iranian
economy; COVID-19 cases are spiking; and Iran's maximalist
positions---demanding the removal of all U.S. sanctions, including those
consistent with the nuclear deal, while refusing to engage directly with
Washington---have put sanctions relief out of reach for the moment.
Sooner or later, Israel will likely use military force to try to prevent
Iran from weaponizing its enriched uranium[. To date, Tehran has been
quite risk averse in responding to U.S. and Israeli strikes, including
the assassination of a top Iranian scientist and the sabotage of Iranian
nuclear sites. But that posture could change.]{.underline} [Frustrated
by the lack of sanctions relief and confounded by the ease with which
Israel has penetrated its internal security, Iran may become more
willing to take risks---]{.underline}much as it was in 1996, when it
attacked a U.S. military installation in Saudi Arabia, and in the fall
of 2019, when it struck Saudi oil facilities. [Iran's decision to begin
enriching uranium at 60 percent is a clear demonstration that the
country has the capacity to get to 90 percent, which is weapons
grade]{.underline}, relatively quickly. The fact of this capability by
no means suggests that Tehran can build a bomb instantaneously or even
has made the decision to do so. But if negotiations fail, Iran will
continue to move forward with advanced centrifuges to create enough
fissile material for a nuclear weapon. The Israeli government has issued
stark warnings that a return to the nuclear deal without changes would
be intolerable. [If the United States and Iran return to compliance
under these circumstances, the potential for escalation might
increase]{.underline}. Sooner or later, [Israel will likely use military
force to try to prevent Iran from weaponizing its enriched uranium---and
**the United States will be dragged into the conflict**.]{.underline}
PREOCCUPATION AND CONSTRAINT During his presidential campaign, Joe Biden
promised a quick return to the 2015 Iran nuclear accord. He probably
shouldn't have. He is confronting the most daunting task of national
recovery of any president since Franklin Roosevelt, and domestic
priorities and politics make reentry into the Iran nuclear deal
particularly difficult. Complicating the task are the policies of
Biden's predecessor, former U.S. President Donald Trump. The Trump
administration imposed sanctions against Iran on human rights and
counterterrorism grounds. Because these sanctions are not covered by the
nuclear deal, a return to the agreement won't make them disappear. Iran,
however, has demanded that all these sanctions be lifted before it will
comply with its nuclear obligations. Little constituency exists in
Washington for returning to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran on precisely
the same terms as before. Republicans and even some crucial Democrats
oppose it. All these factors, combined with the need to reserve
political capital for the administration's domestic agenda, have
rendered Biden cautious and averse to taking risks with Iran's nuclear
development. A DESPERATE CALCULUS Israel's escalating actions against
Iran reflect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security concerns and
his increasing distrust of the United States. [Netanyahu does not
believe that the United States fully accounts for the threats that
Iran's nuclear program, missile capabilities, and support for terrorism
pose to Israel]{.underline}. In his view, the draconian sanctions that
the Trump administration imposed on Iran upon its withdrawal from the
deal should be given more time to shape Iran's economy and political
decisions. I[f, instead, the United States reenters the nuclear
agreement without altering it to address Iran's ballistic missile
program or its activities in the region, Israel will find itself in an
untenable position. Escalation with Iran may prove attractive to
Netanyahu as he faces domestic problems,]{.underline} including
corruption charges and a political stalemate. Netanyahu has reasons to
be confident in his country's ability to take these matters into its own
hands. Unlike several years ago, when the Israeli military had a
restraining influence, Netanyahu now enjoys the support of a hawkish
army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Aviv Kochavi. Israel's military
capabilities vis-à-vis Iran are much more advanced than even a few years
ago. Israel has secured flight routes over Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
states and ordered enhanced fuel tankers from the United States.
Together, these advances dramatically improve the Israeli air force's
ability to fly repeated sorties against targets within Iran. In
addition, Israel now has access to bases in the United Arab Emirates
from which to conduct surveillance or raids against Iran, just across
the Persian Gulf. Moreover, escalation with Iran may prove attractive to
Netanyahu as he faces domestic problems, including corruption charges
and a political stalemate. The Israeli prime minister is too responsible
to lead his country to war solely in order to escape his legal troubles.
But he does stand to benefit, as the Israeli public would not want to
encumber a wartime prime minister with a trial, which would likely be
postponed, and as political opponents would be forced to rally around
him in a national unity coalition. AMERICA INTO THE BREACH [There are no
easy options available to the United States to divert a determined
Netanyahu from the path of escalation that he is on. Netanyahu believes
he knows how to handle Washington. He has considerable support within
the Republican Party and among many Democrats; he also has calculated
that **the Biden administration will not want to jeopardize its domestic
legislative agenda by engaging in a public dispute with Israel.**
I]{.underline}ndeed, the only U.S. policy that might deter Netanyahu
from the path leading to war would be firm refusal and strong diplomacy.
[Washington would have to make Netanyahu understand that further
escalation with Iran would damage U.S.-Israeli relations and that the
administration will not back down in the face of domestic political
pressure.]{.underline} At the same time, the administration would need
to press the other signatories to the nuclear deal to tell Iran in no
uncertain terms that its actions are provocative, that some of its
positions in the Vienna talks are unreasonable, and that the clock is
running out for returning to full compliance. [A firm stance with Israel
and tough diplomacy on the nuclear deal just might allow the United
States to avert the slide toward dangerous escalation between Israel and
Iran.]{.underline} PARTNERSHIP AT A CROSSROADS Israel and Iran have
temporarily settled into a low level, carefully calibrated conflict.
Under these conditions, the Iranian nuclear program takes two steps
forward and the Israelis push it at least one step back. [With no brakes
on its policy, Israel is likely to continue assassinations,
cyberattacks, and bombings in order to hobble the Iranian program,
frustrate U.S. efforts to reenter the nuclear deal, and dissuade Iranian
authorities from returning to compliance. Israel will also continue to
ramp up its military capability. The scenario is an ugly one whose
long-term stability may not hold, either because Israel's real objective
is to provoke an Iranian response that would provide cover for an attack
on Iran's facilities or simply because neither country's strategy is as
clever or finely tuned as it imagines.]{.underline} In September 2019,
Iran launched a drone attack on the Saudi oil company Aramco, which took
half of Saudi Arabia's oil production offline in a matter of minutes and
caught both Riyadh and Washington by surprise. Israel cannot know which
of its incremental attacks will incur an Iranian response that could
lead to spiraling escalation---and no one knows what level of nuclear
enrichment or accumulation of fissile material will trigger an all-out
Israeli assault on Iran. [One way or another, escalation will suck the
United States into a war it did not seek, at a time and place it did not
choose. The Biden administration must make a decision. It can bet that a
fragile stability will last until its legislative agenda is complete, in
which case it does not need to intervene.]{.underline} Or it can step in
now, on the assumption that the near-term consequences of a political
confrontation with Israel and muscular diplomacy with Iran will be more
manageable than the consequences of a war within the next two years.
This week, some of Israel's most senior security officials---its
national security adviser and director of military intelligence, along
with the head of the Mossad---will visit Washington for intensive talks
on Iran against the backdrop of Israeli concerns that Washington is not
showing sufficient regard for Israel's views. According to Israeli press
reports, however, Israeli officials have been instructed not to talk
about the details of current negotiations in Vienna over the nuclear
deal. The Israeli government, pursuing its own strategy, is working at
cross-purposes with a U.S. administration that sees its objectives as
crucial to domestic cohesion and Middle Eastern stability. Netanyahu's
current campaign perpetuates the Israeli prime minister's battles with
Democratic presidents and undermines the cooperation that supposedly
characterizes the two countries' long-standing alliance. Perhaps U.S.
and Israeli interests are simply incompatible. Israel's prime minister
surely has a duty to preserve his country's security; but so does an
American president. In the ebb and flow of international relations, the
pivotal moments are not always obvious---but the crisis precipitated by
the Israeli government's open challenge to the United States surely
looks like one of them

Both champions and critics of U.S. grand strategy after the Cold War
have christened the project "liberal hegemony." But American objectives
and methods were always more hegemonic than liberal. Despite diverging
over whether and how to promote liberalism, U.S. [policymakers
have]{.underline} for nearly three decades [converged around the
premise]{.underline} that Pentagon planners set forth in 1992[: the
United States should maintain a military superiority so overwhelming
that it would dissuade allies and rivals alike from challenging
Washington's authority.]{.underline} That superiority quickly became an
end unto itself. By seeking dominance instead of merely defense, the
strategy of primacy plunged the United States into a downward spiral:
[American actions generated antagonists and enemies, who in turn made
primacy more dangerous to pursue.]{.underline}

For most of the 1990s, the costs of this strategy remained somewhat
hidden. With Russia flattened and China poor, the United States could
simultaneously reduce its defense spending and expand NATO, launch
military interventions in the former Yugoslavia and for the first time
station tens of thousands of troops in the Middle East. Yet by the end
of the decade, U.S. [dominance had begun to generate
blowback.]{.underline} Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist group
declared war on the United States in 1996, citing the U.S. military's
presence in Saudi Arabia as their top grievance; two years later, al
Qaeda bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224
people. [U.S. policymakers]{.underline}, for their part,
[were]{.underline} already [exaggerating the threat posed by weak "rogue
states" and gearing up for ambitious military interventions]{.underline}
to promote democracy and human rights. These pathologies shaped
Washington's overly militarized reaction to the 9/11 attacks, as the
United States entered into successive conflicts in which its
capabilities and interests did not exceed those of local actors. [The
result was endless war.]{.underline}

Now, as the United States struggles to extricate itself from the Middle
East, [China is growing into an economic and political powerhouse and
Russia is asserting itself as a spoiler. That outcome is exactly what
primacy was supposed to prevent.]{.underline} The rise of a near-peer
competitor does not necessarily pose a grave danger to the United
States, whose nuclear deterrent secures it from attack. But [clinging to
the dream of never-ending primacy will ensure trouble, mandating the
containment of rivals and provoking insecurity and aggression in
return.]{.underline} China has yet to undertake a costly bid for
military dominance in East Asia, let alone the world, but [U.S. actions
could push Beijing]{.underline} in that direction.

[Primacy]{.underline} has not merely failed to provide security as it is
narrowly defined. It has also [damaged the environment, undercut the
economic interests of most Americans, and destabilized
democracy.]{.underline} The U.S. [military consumes more oil and
produces more greenhouse gases than any other institution]{.underline}
on earth, according to Brown University's Costs of War Project. In 2017,
the U.S. military's emissions exceeded those of entire industrialized
countries, such as Denmark and Sweden.

Nor does primacy offer a net economic benefit. From the 1940s through
the 1960s, U.S. military preponderance lubricated international
capitalism by containing communism and facilitating the expansion of the
dollar, to which all other currencies were pegged. But after the
collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system and then of the Soviet
Union, currencies were floated, and global markets were integrated. As a
result, U.S. military strength became largely detached from the
international economic order. Today, the status of the U.S. dollar as a
reserve currency, which allows Americans to borrow cheaply, rests
largely on path dependence, the currency's stability, and the dearth of
attractive alternatives---factors that no longer rely on the global
projection of U.S. force that helped usher them in originally. And [the
quest for primacy is now leading the United States to erode its own
financial position by maintaining unnecessary hostilities with states
such as Iran, imposing crippling sanctions on them and forcing third
parties who use the dollar to follow suit. These actions have compelled
European states to seek alternatives to the dollar and have driven down
the dollar's share in global foreign exchange reserves.]{.underline}

The U.S. military contributes to global commerce by protecting the
sea-lanes through which goods (including oil) flow. But doing so does
not require globe-spanning dominance; it requires effective local
partners to handle day-to-day tasks, with a light U.S. air and naval
presence that can be reinforced if and when those partners cannot
overcome a genuine challenge to maritime security. Whatever economic
benefits primacy may indirectly yield, what is certain is that year
after year, the United States spends half of its federal discretionary
budget to fund a military that is costlier than the next seven largest
armed forces combined. [Military spending is one of the least efficient
ways to create jobs, ranking behind tax cuts and spending on education,
health care, infrastructure, and clean energy. The estimated \$6.4
trillion poured into the "war on terror" so far could have rebuilt
communities across the United States that were devastated
by]{.underline} the [financial crisis and]{.underline} the
[recession]{.underline} that followed. Now, many members of those
communities resent the political elites who allowed them to crumble.

[Primacy has also corroded the U.S. political system, which has in turn
produced irresponsible leaders to wield primacy's power.]{.underline}
During the Cold War, the need to counter a threatening adversary
sometimes worked to unify disparate political factions and social groups
in the United States. The post--Cold War quest for primacy offers a
perverse contrast. [The United States has acquired a kaleidoscope of
foreign enemies, whom U.S. officials and the mass media have encouraged
the American public to fear and punish.]{.underline} Small wonder that
in the second decade of the war on terror, a demagogue was able to turn
hatred of foreigners into a premise that propelled him to the
presidency, dividing the country further still.

A NEW MULTILATERALISM FOR A GLOBAL GREEN NEW DEAL [The rules and
practices of the multilateral trade, investment and monetary regime are
in need of urgent reform. **These rules are currently skewed in favor of
global financial and corporate interests, and powerful countries,
leaving national governments, local communities, households, and future
generations to bear the costs**]{.underline} of economic insecurity,
rising inequality, financial instability, and climate change. [The rules
of the global trade and investment regime have been instrumental in
delivering this unbalanced outcome.]{.underline} These limitations are
now widely recognized and a number of efforts are underway, particularly
in the developing world, to establish policies for reform.32 The most
effective efforts will be those that recognize the systemic nature of
the challenge, rather than piecemeal policy tinkering. **[A renewed
multilateralism is required to provide the global public goods needed to
deliver shared prosperity and a healthy planet]{.underline}**, to
cooperate and coordinate on policy initiatives that demand collective
action, to mitigate common risks, and to ensure that no nation's pursuit
of these broader goals infringes on the ability of other nations to
pursue them. [The "Geneva Principles for a Global Green New Deal"
advances an urgent research and policy agenda for a New Multilateralism
to calibrate the global economy toward a 21st century vision of
stability, shared prosperity, and environmental
sustainability.]{.underline} The original New Deal, launched in the
United States in the 1930s and replicated in distinct ways elsewhere in
the industrialized world, particularly after the end of the Second World
War, established a new social contract and accompanying development path
that focused on four broad components: recovery from Depression,
extensive public investment, regulation of finance, and redistribution
of income. While these broad features were consistent with specific
policy goals tailored to particular economic and political
circumstances, they made job creation, the expansion of productive
investment and faster productivity growth common features of successful
post-war economies. In building a global new deal today, we can learn
from those core principles. As before, states require the space to
tailor proactive fiscal and public policies to boost investment and
raise living standards, supported by regulatory and redistributive
strategies that tackle the triple challenges of large inequalities,
demographic pressures and environmental problems. However, the original
New Deal was neither directed at development of the Global South, nor at
global climate change. [The specific challenges of inequality and
insecurity in the 21st century will require innovative and global
approaches. The "Geneva Principles for a Global Green New Deal"
articulates a set of cohesive principles for the design of a reformed
multilateral trade and investment regime.]{.underline} Five broad
strategic goals should frame any such deal: [1. A productive global
economy built around full and decent employment at livable wages, for
all countries 2. A just society that targets closing socio-economic
gaps, within and across generations, nations, households, race and
gender 3. A caring community that protects vulnerable populations and
promotes economic rights 4. A participatory politics that defeats policy
capture by narrow interest groups and extends the democratic principle
to economic decision making 5. A sustainable future based on the
mobilization of resources and policies to decarbonize growth and recover
environmental health in all its dimensions]{.underline} These goals will
be manifest differently in different nations across varying stages of
economic development. Specific policy programs and measures will
necessarily reflect local circumstances, but there will be a series of
initiatives that will likely surface across countries regardless of
their level of development. [Governments everywhere need to end
austerity and boost demand in support of sustainable and inclusive
economies]{.underline} using an active mix of fiscal and monetary
policies as part of a general expansion of government spending that
covers physical and social infrastructure but also employing, whenever
appropriate, public employment schemes. Significant public investment in
clean transport and energy systems is imperative to establish low carbon
growth paths and to transform food production for a growing global
population as well as addressing problems of pollution and environmental
degradation more generally. [This will need to be supported by a green
industrial policy]{.underline}, using a mixture of general and targeted
subsidies, tax incentives, equity investments, loans and guarantees, as
well as accelerated investments in research, development and technology
adaptation, and a new generation of intellectual property and licensing
rules. Specific measures and support will be required in developing
countries to help them leapfrog the old, dirty development path of the
Global North. Raising wages in line with productivity will be key to
moving to a fairer society; this is best achieved by giving workers a
secure and protected right to organize into unions. At the same time,
[job insecurity also needs to be corrected]{.underline} through
appropriate legislative action (including on informal and precarious
work contracts) and active labor market measures. And again, more
progressive tax policies, including on income, wealth, corporations,
property and other forms of rent income, could help address income
inequalities. [Regulating private financial flows will be essential to
steering private finance toward these broader social goals.]{.underline}
Curtailing restrictive business and predatory financial practices will
be key to reigning in corporate rentierism and crowding in private
investment to productive activities included in the green economy But
**[countries cannot be expected to undertake any such policy programs in
isolation.]{.underline}** At the global level, [**a new multilateralism
is urgently needed to pursue these in a way that maximizes the
effectiveness of national development strategies without creating
negative global spillovers to partner nations.** A new multilateralism
will require the following design principles: 1. Global rules should be
calibrated toward the overarching goals of social and economic
stability, shared prosperity, and environmental sustainability and be
protected against capture by the most powerful players 2. States share
common but differentiated responsibilities in a multilateral system
built to advance global public goods and protect the global commons 3.
The right of states to policy space to pursue national development
strategies should be enshrined in global rules 4. Global regulations
should be designed both to strengthen a dynamic international division
of labor and to prevent destructive unilateral economic actions that
prevent other nations from realizing common goals 5. Global public
institutions must be accountable to their full membership, open to a
diversity of viewpoints, cognizant of new voices, and have balanced
dispute resolution systems]{.underline} STEPS FORWARD **[Only through
extensive reforms can the financial and trading systems support a more
stable global economy, help deliver prosperity for all, and backstop the
public investment drive needed to move, at the required speed, to
carbonfree and inclusive growth paths.]{.underline}** As things stand,
[current arrangements fall far short of providing countries with the
resources and predictability needed to support a global green new
deal.]{.underline} A properly resourced, and more democratically
governed, IMF and World Bank will need to get back to their original
business of stabilizing exchange rates, controlling unruly capital flows
and funding infrastructure projects in a low carbon and inclusive
manner. These institutions will need to coordinate with --- and not
attempt to coopt --- an emerging set of development finance institutions
that are ramping up their lending activities to provide additional
public financing to the system. The WTO needs to return to its roots as
a venue for the negotiation of rules regarding trade per se, and not as
a universal engine of laissez-faire. **[Bilateral trade agreements, in
which powerful nations strong-arm weaker ones, should be shunned in
favor of true multilateralism.]{.underline}** All of these institutions
will need to calibrate their efforts toward these broader goals, and
adhere to these "Geneva Principles for a Global Green New Deal" in order
to succeed. The financing requirements will be in the trillions of
dollars with private investments crowded in to the mix through a
properly funded public investment push. [Financing]{.underline} for such
a push [will need to come from a mixture of tax and debt
instruments]{.underline}; returning to the progressive tax structures
common before the 1980s, along with new structures to prevent the
abusive fiscal strategies employed by transnational corporations. [Doing
so will require concerted international efforts and dedicated
institutional support mechanisms.]{.underline} But the [growth, over the
last four decades, of financial markets from 12 trillion to 300 trillion
dollars serves as an indicator of the transformative role that a
properly managed credit regime could play in financing a global new
deal**. If only a fraction of this increase had been directed to meeting
environmental and social challenges the threat of a climate breakdown
would be far less daunting today.**]{.underline} Other more tailored
mechanisms such as for addressing forest-related degradation and water
scarcity will also have to be added to an institutional landscape
tailored to delivering sustainable outcomes. [Significant attention will
need to be paid to the debt sustainability of nations, corporations, and
households as the global community scales to meet these broader
goals.]{.underline} More debt relief for heavily indebted nations,
including orderly processes analogous to corporate bankruptcies, are
required. However, given that private capital flows will remain a
feature of the interdependent economic order, even a well-managed
economy may succumb to a sustained and major attack on its currency, and
a liquidity problem can then be rapidly transformed into an
international debt crisis. [Pursuing a global green new deal must accept
that international finance is under-regulated and that avoiding the
threat of a downward spiral into debt deflation requires new responses
such as capital controls and sovereign debt restructuring
mechanisms]{.underline} --- both of which are increasingly difficult
under international trade and investment treaties. **[The crisis of the
multilateral trading system is also an opportunity to redirect it toward
the goal of sustainable development.]{.underline}**33
[Reforms]{.underline} to trade and investment rules [are perhaps the
highest priority]{.underline} given the laws and regulations in the
trade and investment regime now stretch across the global financial,
trading, investment system --- as well as deep into national policy
making. [Trade and investment rule reform must ensure the maximum space
to undertake financial regulations and debt workouts]{.underline},
innovation and industrial policy, and policies for social welfare that
are in line with the demands of a global green new deal, including the
effective use of subsidies to support structural transformation and the
development of alternative energies and to reengineer the production
process of carbon-intensive industries. Rolling back the numerous free
trade agreements and bi-lateral investments treaties, which have been
particularly destructive of policy space, is a priority. New efforts for
reform at the WTO are an opportunity to put these Geneva principles into
forward looking action.

#### Warming causes extinction

An [[existential risk]{.mark} to civilisation is]{.underline} one
[posing **permanent large negative consequences**]{.underline} to
humanity [which [may]{.mark} never [be]{.mark} undone]{.underline},
either **[[annihilating intelligent life]{.underline}]{.mark}** [or
permanently and drastically curtailing its potential]{.underline}.

[With]{.underline} the [[commitments]{.mark} by nations [to]{.mark} the
2015 **[Paris]{.mark}** Agreement, the current path of warming is 3°C or
more]{.underline} by 2100. [But this figure [do]{.mark}es [not include
"long-term"]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**carbon-cycle feedbacks**, which
are]{.mark} materially relevant now and in the near future due to
the]{.underline} **[[unprecedented]{.mark} rate]{.underline}** [at which
human activity is perturbing the climate system]{.underline}. Taking
these into account, the Paris path would lead to around 5°C of warming
by 2100.

Scientists warn that [warming of [4°]{.mark}C is incompatible with an
organised global community, [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**devastating**
to]{.mark} the **majority of [ecosystems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and
has a **[high probability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} not
[being]{.mark} stable]{.underline}. The World Bank says it may be
"**[[beyond adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}**". But [an existential
threat may also exist for many peoples and regions at a significantly
lower level of warming]{.underline}. In 2017, [3°C of warming was
categorised as "catastrophic"]{.underline} with a warning that, on a
path of unchecked emissions, low-probability, [high-[impact]{.mark}
warming [could be catastrophic by 2050]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Emeritus Director of the Potsdam Institute, Prof. Hans Joachim
Schellnhuber, warns that "[climate change is now reaching
the]{.underline} **[end-game]{.underline}**, [where very soon [humanity
must choose between]{.mark} **taking [unprecedented action]{.mark}**[,
or]{.mark} [accepting]{.mark} that it has been left too late and **bear
[the consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}." He says that [if we continue
down [the present path]{.mark} "there is a very big risk that we
[will]{.mark} just]{.underline} **[[end]{.mark} our
[civilisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The human species will survive
somehow but we will destroy almost everything we have built up over the
last two thousand years."11

Unfortunately, conventional risk and probability analysis becomes
useless in these circumstances because it excludes the full implications
of outlier events and possibilities lurking at the fringes.12

[Prudent risk-management means a tough, objective look at the real risks
to which we are exposed, especially at those **["fat-tail"
events]{.mark}**, which may have consequences that are damaging beyond
quantification, and **[threaten]{.mark} the [survival]{.mark} of human
civilisation**.]{.underline}

[Global warming projections display a "fat-tailed" distribution [with
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[greater likelihood]{.underline}** [of
warming]{.underline}]{.mark} [that is well [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[excess of]{.mark} the [average amount]{.mark} of warming [predicted
by]{.mark} climate [models]{.mark}**, and are of a higher probability
than would be expected]{.underline} under typical statistical
assumptions. More importantly, the risk lies disproportionately in the
"fat-tail" outcomes, as illustrated in Figure 1.

have pulled at the seams of Western economic integration. Former U.S.
President Donald Trump's threats to pull out of NATO and the chaotic
withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 have chipped away at military trust
between the United States and Europe. A Marine Le Pen victory later this
month in France would pose additional challenges to the alliance, and
looming concerns about the 2024 presidential election raise doubts about
the United States' commitment. [**[If not managed]{.mark}

Russia). Such a world---with the United States and Europe often
collaborating, but also at odds when their interests diverge---would
make the management of China and Russia more difficult, as the two would
have opportunities to trigger and exploit U.S.-European tensions. It
would also represent a major missed opportunity for the United States
and Europe.

Utilizing ideal points, we proposed cohesion, deviation, and adhesion
measures to empirically explore security alliance cohesion, Member State
deviations, and third state adhesions. Our findings suggest that
security alliances such as NATO and the Warsaw Pact had higher cohesion
than other UN members, that external threat increased security alliance
cohesion, and that **[the United States turned out to be the most
significant deviating member in NATO]{.underline}** Since 1980, while
third countries such as Australia, South Korea, and Japan were more
aligned with the NATO alliance whereas Israel was more aligned with the
United States. By using our measures, one can study any alignment
pattern among any state groups in the UN, even without a priori
identifications of state groupings. Measures developed and tested in
this study can provide researchers with strong diagnostic tools. The
study contributes to the overall UNGA voting literature by providing
statistical inferences about the validity of the data. We believe that
the approach and new measures presented here could be useful to
investigate cohesion levels in other intergovernmental organizations
such as the EU and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, as well as
economic communities like BRICS, while pinpointing each state's
political distance vis-à-vis each other or to a defined group of states.
Furthermore, using this approach and these new measures could help
researchers to concentrate on specific questions (e.g., whether the
foundation of BRICS really brought Member States together on the issues
of high politics, or whether Brexit could have been predicted). In other
words, while the approach offered here was utilized more for descriptive
purposes, it presents a superior alternative to measure variance across
time, increasing our predictive power for actual or potential dramatic
policy shifts at Member State and at (any) group level by using the UNGA
voting data. [As the Trump administration threatened to abandon NATO,
and as Russia revives and China rises, **"How long can NATO last in a
post-US hegemonic, multipolar world?" became one of the most important
questions in contemporary world politics.**]{.underline} Contrary to
Trump's withdrawal rhetoric, we found that the height of the US ally
deviation from NATO was during 2001--2008, coinciding with the
presidential term of George W. Bush. In fact, our findings suggest that
Trump's NATO deviation scores came behind those of two Democrat
presidents, Obama and Clinton, when they were put into an ordinal scale
for heuristic purposes. Throughout this article, we deliberately tried
to avoid any discussion that might not be empirically verified, keeping
the scope of the article rather descriptive. Still, we believe studying
the past of the security alliances would give us considerable
explanatory and even predictive power. We observed that threat
perception, both for external and internal (i.e., intra-alliance)
threats, played a significant role in political alignments for security
alliances. [The 9/11 attacks and activation of Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty led to a turning point for the NATO allies, as **free
riding was replaced by joining costly global wars that were arguably
triggered by US hegemony in the world.**]{.underline} In the past, the
United States provided deterrence against the Soviet Union as a public
good for NATO members. [Over the past two decades, however, an
increasing number of NATO members have come to believe that they are
being dragged into "American wars."]{.underline} In this case, [the
problem would not be one of US abdication or abandonment but balancing
the hegemon.]{.underline}59 NATO has survived US ally deviation for four
decades. The height of US deviation was actually in the past, not in the
present. While alliance cohesion was an important topic, especially
after the end of the Cold War, discussions about NATO have happened
largely at a theoretical level, revolving around realist, liberal and
constructivist propositions about whether NATO would collapse or
survive.60 The present research, in contrast, was conducted at an
empirical level. By applying this approach to NATO, we were able to
measure the flexibility of the arrangement and obtain evidence to show
what was really happening with the United States and NATO, despite what
might have been expected from the rhetoric of Trump. While our findings
support some earlier proposals, such as the external threat hypothesis,
they also contradict some others, including the literature on the
decline of US hegemony and its policy implications. We therefore hope
that the new approach developed here to measure foreign policy
preferences by using a spatial model and UNGA voting data might reignite
interest for more empirically driven future research on NATO and other
alliances, as well as cohesion of states in other organizations, while
also strengthening the overall validity and therefore confidence in
using UNGA voting data with spatial models.

[cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A proposal to withdraw Canada from
NATO was tabled at a recent policy conference for one of Canada's three
major political parties. The proposal was defeated, but it represents a
fringe anti-NATO narrative within Canada's illiberal left; if left
unaddressed, such a narrative could grow.

[[If]{.mark} countries like [Russia perceive NATO as]{.mark}
an]{.underline} **[atomized collection of states]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} **[[varied priorities]{.underline}]{.mark}** [rather
than a **unified front**]{.underline}, [the [Alliance]{.mark} is

Bottom Lines

[**Oil Is a Leading Cause of War**. Between one-quarter and one-half of
interstate wars since 1973 have been linked to oil.]{.underline}

Fracking Does Not Change the Fundamentals. Although hydraulic fracturing
(\"fracking\") is transforming the U.S. oil and gas sector, the United
States will not be isolated from foreign markets and events. Its allies
will continue to have vital energy needs, and disruptions in the
integrated world market will continue to affect domestic markets. [The
United States therefore has an enduring interest in maintaining an
**open global oil market.**]{.underline}

Watch Out for Unexpected Sources of Conflict. [The oil industry can
**cause or exacerbate conflict** in multiple ways: **competition** over
shipping lanes and pipelines, oil-related terrorism, petro-aggression,
and resource scarcity in consumer states are all potential sources of
international conflict.]{.underline}

[Oil as a Leading Cause of War]{.underline}

Although the threat of \"resource wars\" over possession of oil reserves
is often exaggerated, th[e sum total of the **political effects**
generated by the oil industry makes oil a leading cause of war. Between
one-quarter and one-half of interstate wars since 1973 have been
connected to one or more **oil-related causal mechanisms**. No other
commodity has had such an impact on international security.]{.underline}

[The **influence of oil** on conflict is often poorly
understood]{.underline}. In U.S. public debates about the 1991 and 2003
Iraq wars, both sides focused excessively on the question of whether
[the United States was fighting for **possession of oil
reserves**]{.underline}; neither sought a broader understanding of how
oil shaped the preconditions for war.

[Oil fuels international conflict through eight distinct mechanisms: (1)
resource wars, in which states try to acquire oil reserves by force; (2)
petro-aggression, whereby oil insulates aggressive leaders such as
Saddam Hussein or Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini from domestic opposition,
and therefore makes them more willing to engage in risky foreign policy
adventurism; (3) the externalization of civil wars in oil-producing
states (\"petrostates\"); (4) financing for insurgencies---for instance,
Iran funneling oil money to Hezbollah; (5) conflicts triggered by the
prospect of oil-market domination, such as the United States\' war with
Iraq over Kuwait in 1991; (6) clashes over control of oil transit
routes, such as shipping lanes and pipelines; (7) oil-related
grievances, whereby the presence of foreign workers in petrostates helps
extremist groups such as al-Qaida recruit locals; and (8) oil-related
obstacles to multilateral cooperation, such as when an importer\'s
attempt to curry favor with a petrostate prevents multilateral
cooperation on security issues. These mechanisms can contribute to
**conflict individually or in combination**.]{.underline}

The linkages between oil and international conflict are growing
increasingly important in light of three transitions under way in global
energy markets. The first is the shift in patterns of global oil
production away from traditional suppliers in the Middle East and toward
(1) suppliers of unconventional oil reserves in North America and (2)
new suppliers of conventional oil, especially in Africa. As many as
sixteen developing countries will become oil exporters in the near
future, creating a swath of new international security concerns. Second,
the low oil prices of the 1990s have given way to higher and more
volatile prices, increasing the magnitude of the consequences one can
expect from oil-conflict linkages. Third, [the **relative decline of
U.S. hegemony** may reduce the provision of public goods such as
security of shipping lanes and pipelines. Although these transitions
alter some of the ways in which the **oil industry contributes to
international conflict**, none eliminates linkages between the two or
allows the United States to disengage from global markets.]{.underline}

The Role of Fracking

Understanding the eight mechanisms linking oil to international security
can help policymakers think beyond the much-discussed goal of energy
security, defined as reliable access to affordable fuel supplies.
Achieving such an understanding is important in light of recent changes
in the United States. As hydraulic fracturing---\"fracking\"---of shale
oil and gas accelerates, energy imports are projected to decline, and
North America could even achieve energy independence, in the sense of
low or zero net overall energy imports, in the next decade. Yet the
United States will continue to import large volumes of oil, and the
world price of oil will continue to affect it. Moreover, so long as the
rest of the world remains dependent on global oil markets, the fracking
revolution will do little to reduce many oil-related threats to
international security. [The emergence of aggressive, revolutionary
leaders in petrostates would likely continue to pose **threats to
regional security**]{.underline}. Petrostates will continue to be weakly
institutionalized and thus subject to civil wars, creating the kind of
security problems that demand responses by the international community,
as occurred in Libya in 2011. Petro-financed insurgent groups such as
Hezbollah will persist, as will threats to the shipping lanes and oil
transit routes that supply important U.S. allies, such as Japan.

In sum, energy autarky is not the answer. Self-sufficiency will bring
economic benefits to the United States, but few gains for national
security. [So long as the oil market remains globally integrated,
national oil imports matter far less than total consumption. Rather than
viewing energy self-sufficiency as a panacea, the United States should
contribute to international security by making **long-term investments
in research and development** to reduce oil consumption and provide
alternative fuel sources in the transportation sector.]{.underline} In
addition to the economic and environmental benefits of reducing oil
consumption, substantial evidence exists that military and security
benefits will accrue from such investments.

Unexpected Sources of Conflict

Policymakers must also think systematically about oil-security linkages
when monitoring emerging security threats as the global oil industry
transforms itself. With sixteen additional countries potentially
exporting oil in the near future, new international dynamics will
materialize, especially in Africa. Furthermore, if oil prices remain
high, incentives for resource grabs will grow. [Resource wars are most
likely to occur in **unpopulated territories or naval zones**, as oil
can be extracted from these areas without the need to manage a
populated, potentially hostile territory.]{.underline} Thus,
policymakers should be most concerned about disputed territories in the
East China and South China Seas and naval borders in the Caspian Sea.
[There are already competing **sovereignty claims** to territory in
those regions, and considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the
energy resources located there, creating conditions ripe for
miscalculation and mutual suspicion. Policymakers should be especially
concerned about security threats that arise from unexpected sources,
such as **allies\' energy needs or seemingly benign actions** that
prompt hostile responses from rivals.]{.underline}

By contrast, [oil was the **quintessential energy source** for the
"Neotechnic" age of steel, internal combustion, chemicals, and
electricity---**the Second Industrial Revolution**.]{.underline} Without
access to patents jealously guarded by German chemical companies through
their alliances with oil companies, coal producers had no ability to
produce synthetic fuels or enter the petrochemical industry.31 [The
latter]{.underline}, in particular, [was a major consumer for petroleum
besides transportation and **power generation**.]{.underline} The
petrochemical industry that emerged after World War II became the
world's primary source of synthetic rubber and helped spearhead the
"green revolution" through the diffusion of fertilizers developed from
petrochemicals (not to mention the oil-fueled mechanization of
agriculture). 

[The close relationship between the **oil industry** and the **health of
the global economy** and **petroleum's indispensable role in modern
warfare** means it is no surprise that the superpowers that emerged from
World War II possessed large domestic supplies of oil.]{.underline} But
U.S. hegemony depended on more than mere self-sufficiency, which mostly
evaporated after 1948.32 [A large U.S. domestic industry created the
wherewithal to expand overseas both for markets and for new supplies.
This process incentivized American diplomats to solidify U.S.
predominance in Latin America and influence over **budding oil
producers** in areas once of marginal interest to the United
States]{.underline} (such as the Persian Gulf). [Oil also shifted the
**naval balance in favor of the United States** even before World War I,
particularly in the Pacific, where Great Britain and Japan were
relatively starved of oil while the U.S. Navy enjoyed prolific oilfields
in California.]{.underline}33 

[Oil also gave the United States an **immense advantage** during the
Second Industrial Revolution]{.underline}. Germany was a leader in the
development of the internal combustion engine and was unchallenged
within the realm of chemicals, but it could not keep pace with U.S.
motorization or follow Great Britain and the United States into
converting its battle fleet to oil before World War I.34 [Even Britain
for its oil depended on sources controlled directly or indirectly by the
United States and relied after World War I on **U.S. security and
financial assistance** to maintain access. Oil combined with industrial
power---both aircraft production and petrochemicals---similarly allowed
the United States **to exert dominion** over the newest domain of
warfare---the air]{.underline}---even if the results never matched the
claims of enthusiasts such as Giulio Douhet35 (although recent studies
suggest that the firebombing of Japan during World War II was far more
effective at producing social disorder than it was in Germany36). In
effect, [American **predominance on the high seas and in the air**
restricted potential rivals' access to oil in the 20th century far more
extensively than British control of coaling stations ever did a century
prior.]{.underline} 

[U.S. commercial ascendancy in the oil industry contributed to the
pricing of even foreign oil in dollars.]{.underline} Obviously, the fact
that oil often required payment in dollars or hard currencies
convertible into dollars was a profound handicap for countries suffering
from balance of payments deficits. Likewise, reliance on dollars and
U.S. banks as financial intermediaries became yet another source of
vulnerability for countries such as Japan: Its access to oil in 1941 was
effectively blocked without a formal embargo when the United States
froze Japanese accounts in the American banks.37 

[The growing demand for oil priced in dollars throughout the 20th
century enabled a form of seigniorage whereby the United States could
pay for imported oil using dollars that lost some of their value before
foreigners could recycle them into U.S. goods and services.]{.underline}
The fact that oil is traded in dollars encouraged foreign central and
private banks to hold dollars as a reserve currency even after the
collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971--1973; it also incentivized
the use of dollars for cross-border trade even when a U.S. actor is not
the counterparty, because dollars can always be exchanged for goods and
services around the world. Nations always had an incentive to earn or
accumulate dollars even if they traded little with the United
States---yet another form of "exorbitant privilege" that so enraged
critics of American power, albeit one with major costs for certain
sectors of the U.S. economy. Specifically, if the dollar was to retain
its predominance after Washington severed the link with gold, the United
States had to embrace full capital mobility and commit to providing
ample liquidity to satisfy economic growth. These developments depressed
domestic manufacturing by artificially raising U.S. exchange rates and
encouraged U.S. firms to look for cheaper labor abroad.38 One of the
major beneficiaries of this process was, of course, China. 

Furthermore, unlike coal, [oil is produced in relatively few geographic
locales, two of which]{.underline} (North America and the Gulf of
Mexico/Caribbean) [were in the U.S. orbit]{.underline}. [The United
States has]{.underline} (with the assistance of Great Britain at least
until 1971) [worked consistently to ensure that **no rival foreign or
domestic power**]{.underline} (Nasserist Egypt, Ba'athist Iraq, or
revolutionary Iran) [could dominate the Middle East]{.underline}, long
before President Jimmy Carter articulated his Carter Doctrine in 1980.39
[Most oil is transported by tanker]{.underline} (thanks in part to
pipelines' vulnerability to sabotage or economic blackmail), [which
gives the **dominant naval power** extraordinary coercive ability in the
event of war or crisis since it is difficult for either producing or
consuming nations to stockpile more than **a few months' worth of
oil**.]{.underline} Even then, doing so entails a tremendous financial
and material cost due to the vast quantity and diversity of petroleum
that modern nations require, and because it is impossible to recycle oil
or petroleum in the same way as other critical commodities, such as
copper, nickel, tungsten, chromium, and others.40 

Ultimately, [oil---its ubiquity in modern societies and centrality to
military affairs, the operations of the industry, and geopolitical
competition over access---has served to create **an American hegemony
that has no historical parallel** in either its **military or financial
dimensions**.]{.underline} Moreover, [hydrocarbons have preserved this
power even as the United States, like Great Britain before it,
relinquished its status as the world's dominant **industrial power and
oil producer**.]{.underline} While nations such as Saudi Arabia and the
Soviet Union overtook the United States as an oil producer in the 1970s,
U.S. firms continued to dominate the international trade in oil. Even
more important, oil-related transactions continued to be denominated in
dollars. 

A century before, coal sustained British primacy but ultimately proved
to be a hindrance as technological, social, and political change
affected the structures of nations, economies, and conventional warfare.
Even supplies in coal-rich Great Britain were vulnerable to labor
unrest, and the coal unions' close links to the Labour Party forced the
government to nationalize the industry even as its profitability
declined. To make matters worse, British earnings from coal exports
after World War I shrank as new sources came online and demand slackened
from the ongoing conversion to oil. 

Before 1914, this last factor was most pronounced in the naval
dimension, but thereafter it spread to other domains of warfare thanks
to the internal combustion engine. Coal was not suitable for internal
combustion, and the transition away from steam left Great Britain
saddled with obsolete infrastructure around the world (coaling stations
and mines---a version of the "stranded asset" problem). Finally, Britain
had to restructure its naval and maritime power by converting from coal
to oil during a period of financial duress. This shift occurred at a
time when Britain was already under pressure from rising naval
challenges from Germany, Japan, and the United States. Even though
Britain managed to defeat its German rival and win Japan as an ally
during World War I, it did so with U.S. oil and dollars, while the
growth in U.S. naval power and dominance in oil global production meant
that the United States controlled Britain's access to oil even after
British firms began developing the Middle East, where security in
wartime was always questionable. 

**[Oil, therefore, in many ways created as well as sustained American
hegemony]{.underline}**. One might assume that the resurgence of U.S.
domestic oil production during the "shale revolution" would presage a
new era of American geopolitical dominance, but that is a short-sighted
perspective that assumes the future will mimic the past. The fact of
anthropogenic climate means that any future premised on
hydrocarbon-fueled growth is out of the question. Unless the United
States recognizes and acts on this fact, oil may end up posing a greater
risk to its hegemony than coal did for British primacy. 

[In the United States, the oil and gas industry has long enjoyed
**special political privileges** (tax breaks and incentives) and has
used them to stifle alternatives. Preserving control over the access
**to oil and the global oil market** has also encouraged the United
States to devote vast resources to the strategic sinkhole that is the
Middle East]{.underline}.41 This status quo no longer seems tenable.
Even before [the]{.underline} recent pandemic, [climate change
threatened to turn the **oil and gas industries'** reserves into
stranded assets and therefore erode the industry's **financial and
political power**]{.underline}.42 And the opportunity costs of delaying
action must not be overlooked. The United States stopped investing in
battery technology after World War II because oil was so cheap and
plentiful. Conversely, [China currently possesses the **lion's share of
minerals** essential for **lithium batteries** and has undertaken the
leading role in the latter's construction.]{.underline}43 

Perhaps most important, [China is poised to take **a decisive role** in
the global effort to **curtail carbon dioxide emissions**.]{.underline}
On the one hand, [this is welcome news from the country with the largest
share of emissions. On the other hand, it is worrying because **American
denialism** about climate change and **China's growing importance**
within the global economy are both forcing stalwart U.S. allies such as
the Europeans to seek collaboration with Beijing, even as China's
foreign policy becomes more bellicose]{.underline}.44 

[Hydrocarbons were undeniably a necessary condition for Anglo-American
predominance, but there is a possibility that the latter can thrive only
if the world depends on the former for its energy needs.]{.underline}
The era of Euro-American predominance was always an outlier in human
history; until at least the 15th century, if not the 18th century, Asia
accounted for a larger share of global economy activity because of its
larger population and more efficient administrative and production
techniques.45 What if the transition away from hydrocarbons accelerates
the process of the world returning to a premodern economic balance of
power---that is to say, an Asia-dominated or even Sino-centric world
order? 

To return to the introductory thesis, [it was the combination of
**American industrial power** and **American preponderant influence**
over the **global oil trade** that served as a **key pillar of U.S.
hegemony**]{.underline} after 1945. [If there is indeed a close link
between the control of energy and geopolitical primacy or even hegemony,
then China appears well positioned to leapfrog the United States in **a
world that depends on renewables** rather than fossil fuels for its
energy needs.]{.underline}46 JFQ 

 

#### Oil wars cause disease, disability, environmental destruction, violence, and humanitarian disasters\--extinction.

**Klare, PhD, 11**

(Michael, Five Colleges professor of Peace and World Security Studies,
The Public Health Implications of Resource Wars\
<https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/global>)

[Competition for resources between or within nations is likely to become
an increasingly common cause of armed conflict. Competition for
**petroleum** is especially likely to **trigger armed conflict** because
petroleum is a highly valuable resource whose supply is destined to
contract. Wars fought over petroleum and other resources can create
**public health concerns** by causing **morbidity and mortality**,
**damaging societal infrastructure**, **diverting resources**,
**uprooting people**, and **violating human rights**.]{.underline}
Public health workers and the organizations with which they are
affiliated can help prevent resource wars and minimize their
consequences by (1) promoting renewable energy and conservation, (2)
documenting the impact of past and potential future resource wars, (3)
protecting the human rights of affected noncombatant civilian
populations during armed conflict, and (4) developing and advocating for
policies that promote peaceful dispute resolution. [War has enormous
**tragic impacts** **on people\'s lives and the environment.** War
accounts for **more death and disability than** many **major diseases**
do. It **destroys families, communities,** and sometimes **entire
nations** and cultures. It **siphons** human and **financial resources**
away **from health** and other human services. It damages the
infrastructure that supports the health of society, such as systems that
provide safe food and water, electrical power, transportation, and
communication. War **violates human rights**. It uproots people, forcing
them to migrate to other countries or to become internally displaced
persons within their own countries. It contributes to the **spread of
infectious disease**. The mindset of war---which endorses the notion
that violence is the best way to resolve conflicts or
disputes---contributes to **domestic violence**, **street crime,** and
many other kinds of violence throughout the world. War, and the
preparation for war, **contaminates** and damages the **environment**
and uses vast amounts of nonrenewable fuels and other resources. In sum,
war damages not only the health of people but also the very fabric of
society.]{.underline}1 Wars today tend to be fought within nations
(civil wars) instead of between nations. They are fought mainly with
small arms and light weapons, and they usually involve attacks on
civilians. In the past 20 years, since the end of the Cold War and
withdrawal of US and Soviet military assistance to many less developed
countries, military forces and armed groups in some countries have had
to become more self-reliant, for example by engaging in illicit
enterprises and exploiting local natural resources. As the International
Committee of the Red Cross has demonstrated, insurgent groups frequently
acquire weapons by trading resources (such as minerals) that are under
their control, often illegally.2 Such resources have come to be called
"conflict minerals" or "conflict resources." Also in the past 20 years,
control over armed forces has become decentralized, with military power
deriving from control of resources, arms, or drugs, or from the
intensity of fear created in the local population. [The US government
has recognized a **clear link** between illegal resource extraction and
contemporary conflicts on the one hand and **humanitarian disasters**
with resultant public health consequences on the other.]{.underline} The
preamble to Section 1502 of the Wall Street Reform Act of 2010 states:
It is the sense of Congress that the exploitation and trade of conflict
minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is helping
to finance conflict characterized by extreme levels of violence in the
eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly sexual- and
gender-based violence, and contributing to an emergency humanitarian
situation therein.3 In an effort to combat this trade, the act requires
US corporations to take appropriate measures to identify the source of
minerals used in their products and to eliminate those deemed to be
conflict minerals. The sale of diamonds to finance other military
activities of this type has contributed to additional humanitarian
disasters, prompting additional efforts to curb illicit trafficking.
Resource wars are violent conflicts that are largely driven by
competition for control over vital or valuable natural materials, such
as oil, water, land, timber, animals (or animal products), gold, silver,
gems, and other key minerals. Resource wars can occur between states as
(1) wars of conquest, in which a state or empire employs force to
acquire resource-rich territories or colonies; (2) territorial disputes,
in which 2 or more states fight over a border region or offshore
territory with valuable resource deposits; or (3) access wars, in which
a state fights to gain access to a critical resource deposit in another
country. Resource wars can also occur within states, when groups fight
for control over key sources of raw materials or over the allocation of
the fees and royalties (or "rents") obtained by governments from private
entities that extract resources from areas owned or controlled by the
state. A desire to gain control over a valuable resource supply or the
wealth it generates is a dominant factor leading to war; however,
[conflicts over resources are usually driven by other factors as well,
such as ethnic animosities and historical grievances.]{.underline}4,5 In
the current article, we examine what makes resource wars distinctive and
an important issue for public health, and we outline ways in which
public health workers and the organizations and professional
associations with which they are affiliated can minimize the
consequences of these wars and contribute to their prevention. Much of
this article is focused on wars fought over petroleum; in a recent
commentary we examined armed conflicts over water and what public health
workers can do to address them.6 Go to: WHY RESOURCE WARS ARE RELEVANT
TO PUBLIC HEALTH We believe that resource wars are relevant to public
health because of their **[profound consequences for public
health]{.underline}** and because public health workers have potential
roles and responsibilities to minimize these consequences and to help
prevent resource wars. Public health has been defined as what we, as a
society, do collectively "to assure the conditions in which people can
be healthy."7 R[esource wars threaten the conditions in which people can
be healthy.]{.underline} Although public health is a societal function,
it is a function performed mainly by public health workers in government
agencies, academic institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and
private-sector entities who work to assure the conditions in which
people can be healthy. Although most public health workers do not
address resource wars, some have the opportunity---and the
responsibility---to help document the health consequences of resource
wars, to raise awareness of these consequences, and to advocate for
policies and programs for minimizing these consequences and for helping
to prevent resource wars. Public health has a responsibility to address
the fundamental causes of disease and to prevent adverse health
outcomes.8 [War is a major cause of **disease, disability, and death;**
thus, war is a major public health problem]{.underline}.1,9 The Public
Health Oath, which some public health students recite at orientation and
graduation, includes the declaration: I will work to ensure that people
have the chance to live full and productive lives, free from avoidable
disease and disability.10 Resource wars threaten people\'s ability to
live full and productive lives; they also provide opportunities for
public health workers to help prevent avoidable disease, disability, and
death.

### 1NC\-\--Russia War

#### **US is willing to go great extents to maintain heg and weaken Russia, including war\-\--Ukraine proves**

**Dogan 2/22**/22 \[Dogan, Haluk, Haluk Dogan is a PhD candidate in
Strategy and Security within the Department of Politics at the

[**In** a moot **effort to cling to its hegemony and keep NATO relevant,
Washington has**, in turn, **allowed the invasion to
happen.**]{.underline} Following a long period of escalation, Russian
President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops into Eastern Ukraine's two
breakaway regions, prompting immediate Western condemnation and an
emergency UN Security Council meeting. [While Moscow stands accused by
the West of increasing acts of aggression on the Ukrainian border, the
invasion was not a one-sided event.]{.underline} For months, [**the
Anglo-American bloc has been unwilling to de-escalate the crisis.**
Washington]{.underline} and London have [aimed to]{.underline}
resuscitate the case for the NATO alliance, to invalidate arguments for
a separate European Union-wide security arrangement, and to [weaken
Russia]{.underline} in seeking to prevent the emergence of rival blocs
in Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific regions. However, to put it bluntly,
[this strategy will not reverse the decline of American
hegemony.]{.underline} Is the 'transatlantic alliance' back? A couple of
days before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr [Zelenskyy
expressed his disappointment at the failure of his Western "friends" to
support Ukraine vis-a-vis Russian aggression. This perception is
consistent with Ukrainian officials' previous accusation that US
President Joe **Biden gave Moscow a "green light" to
invade.**]{.underline} Kiev's disappointment is completely
understandable. Giving Moscow the green light is as much about
transatlantic relations as it is about West-Russia or Ukraine-Russia
relations. [**The US' post-World War II hegemony is predicated on its
domination in continental Europe**, with NATO acting as the principal
mechanism for achieving American primacy.]{.underline} [The
Anglo-American strategy now focuses on preventing European states from
acting independently. The Russian threat is thought to serve that aim,
pushing Europe to be in need of American and British power.]{.underline}
The Anglo-American bloc has never been happy with France's attempts to
establish an alternative European security mechanism, or with Germany's
relations with Russia -- especially in terms of cooperation on the Nord
Stream gas pipeline. [The growing economic ties between the European
Union and China are also causes of concern for the Anglo-American
alliance.]{.underline} In this context, it is not surprising Biden
pointed out at the 2021 Virtual Munich Security Conference: "America is
back. The transatlantic alliance is back...The partnership between
Europe and the United States, in my view, is and must remain the
cornerstone of all that we hope to accomplish in the 21st Century, just
as we did in the 20th Century." Eliminating Russia in the 'Great Game'?
Neither NATO nor Western states will go to war with Russia over the
invasion of Ukraine. [The invasion justifies their efforts to undermine
Russia economically and politically.]{.underline} However, [the strategy
of weakening Russia is not only about its military activities in Eastern
Europe.]{.underline} [The Kremlin has long embraced an approach that
emphasises Russia's great power status in a multipolar world, in direct
opposition to the US' vision of a unipolar world in which it reigns
supreme.]{.underline} Therefore, [**the Anglo-American goal is** not
only **to** weaken Russia via economic sanctions, or harm Moscow's
economic interests in Europe, but also to divert its attention and
energy away from the Indo and Asia-Pacific in particular, with the aim
of **hinder**ing **Russia's partnerships** with India and
China.]{.underline} India has decades-long ties with Russia, and New
Delhi recently started receiving Russian S-400 defence systems. But
India is also a member of Quad -- an alliance involving the US, Japan,
and Australia, which aims to counter China's growing assertiveness. Both
the US and Britain have long been pushing India to cooperate with them
in dealing with China. At the last Quad meeting, the US requested that
India stand by its side in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Another important topic for discussion was the growing economic and
diplomatic relationships between Russia and China. [The Anglo-American
bloc hopes that the Ukraine invasion will severely wound Russia,
preventing it from being an important rival actor in their confrontation
with China.]{.underline} The question of American decline Anglo-American
domination will push Europe into submission to some extent, and Russia
will be wounded. But will this reverse the unravelling of American
hegemony in the long term? As Russian President Vladimir Putin made
clear in his televised speech just before the invasion, [sanctions
imposed by the West will not dissuade Russia from attempting to preserve
its standing on the world stage.]{.underline} NATO has already lost
prestige and power, and the invasion of Ukraine will only worsen this
situation. Increasing the Anglo-American bloc's weight in Europe due to
the conflict in Eastern Europe will also have a negative impact on their
ability to contain China in Asia. As it follows Russia's annexation of
Crimea, Russia's invasion of Ukraine will not cause France to abandon
its call for strategic autonomy for the EU entirely, nor will it change
the interdependence of Europe and Russia on gas. The Anglo-American
coalition's gas diversification efforts in favour of Europe will affect
the strategic dynamics in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Yet it
is not likely to obstruct the Nord Stream 2 project, despite Washington
wanting to see this. Due to the steady erosion of the US' hegemonic
position in the world economy, it appears that China will continue to be
the EU's biggest trading partner. India has already signalled that it
will remain neutral on the Ukraine crisis, which implies that Russia's
invasion of Ukraine will have little impact on the close ties between
Moscow and New Delhi. More crucially, this situation appears to have
given Moscow and Beijing further reasons to act together and get closer,
despite their conflicting interests in Asia. They share a common desire
to challenge the Western-dominated international system. Should Russia
be wounded by Western sanctions, it will rely on China in economic terms
to some extent, while their collective security actions will hasten the
demise of US hegemony. In the case of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
there is no absolute winner. Indeed, [nothing will change in terms of
the ongoing and gradual unravelling of global American
hegemony.]{.underline}

As the World War I centennial is celebrated, [repressed thoughts of
great power war once again begin to surface.]{.underline} With today's
highly "interconnected global economy" underwritten by a liberal order
leading to the "rise of the rest," it appears unlikely that any state
would want to disrupt the current system. And yet, [the constant stream
of somber news reignites fears of a calamitous global
catastrophe.]{.underline} In times of international flux, where the
worst seems possible, it is important to turn to those who can best
interpret these eras. In the case of great power or "hegemonic" wars,
there is hardly a greater authority than Robert Gilpin. In his seminal
work on the subject, War and Change in World Politics, [Gilpin argues
that three preconditions must be met for a hegemonic war to
occur.]{.underline} First, Gilpin believes that the soon-to-be warring
parties must feel there is a "'closing in' of space and opportunities."
Second, there must be a general "perception that a fundamental
historical change is taking place." Finally, events around the world
start to "escape human control." Notably, **[all three]{.underline}** of
these **[conditions currently exist in the world.]{.underline}** Closing
In Europe, where great power conflict took place for centuries, was
heavily congested and contested. As powers like Britain, France, Germany
and others rose, they fought for influence and geography at the expense
of the others' territory. Due to the close quarters, **[any desire for
expansion on one country's part would cause concern in the
others.]{.underline}** Today, some say, the world is different. The two
powers that would compete in a war --- the United States and China ---
are separated by a vast ocean, supposedly making it hard for each to
antagonize the other. This, however, is not true. The map may show an
expansive world, but new technologies --- leading to hyperconnectivity
and shorter travel times, especially for military equipment --- have
made the world "claustrophobic." To wit, when China announced an "Air
Defense Identification Zone" the United States quickly deployed two B-52
bombers to challenge its claim. And that was using old equipment.
**[Both China and the United States are developing hypersonic missiles
and vehicles.]{.underline}** Humanity has already conquered physical
space with commercial flight and fast ships. Now, it continues to shrink
space even further for potentially decisive advantage. It is also hard
to claim that China and the United States are far apart when they
regularly bump up against each other as they have in the South China
Sea. Perception Since the dawn of "Pax Americana" after World War II,
belief in the United States as the undisputed global hegemon remained
fairly stable. Until now. According to a recent Pew poll, **[Americans'
views of the United States as a global power have reached a 40-year
low.]{.underline}** Indeed, only 17 percent believe that America plays a
"more important and powerful role than ten years ago." Rightly or
wrongly, this perception exists. Even though most people still find the
United States preferable to China, regional powers can use the
widespread belief that America is declining to make their cases for
running the system. In fact they are already doing so to a degree. For
example, China's Global Times reports that 47 percent of people believe
China has achieved "major power" status. Should both perceptions keep
trending in the same direction --- the United States is declining while
China rises --- then the feeling of an historic shift is almost
inevitable. Human Control As current events prove, **[even the great
powers cannot stop horrendous things from happening in the
world.]{.underline}** From Latin America and Africa to Eastern Europe,
the Middle East, and East Asia, chaos and turmoil run rampant. While
this is a particularly bad period for international affairs, it is naïve
to think this may be an isolated epoch. In fact, there is reason to
think **[the world might grow more unstable in the years
ahead.]{.underline}** Over the next 11 years, the world can expect
another one billion people, reaching a total of around 8 billion by
2030. [As technology becomes more powerful, it will]{.underline} do two
things. First, it will empower the individual, or a group of
individuals, to [do great]{.underline} good or great [harm.]{.underline}
Second, it will allow individuals to be more aware of how the middle
class lives. People around the world will demand similar things, causing
stress on governments and brewing civil unrest and instability. Thus, as
people are further empowered and further angered, the probability that
these non-state actors --- indeed, normal, everyday people --- disrupt
international affairs or geopolitics is high. Governments will continue
to have less and less control of the citizenry, allowing the regular
citizen to do with her newfound power what she wills. In essence, we
will see, in a big way, the diffusion of power.

### 1NC\-\--AT: Transition Wars Violent

**US heg collapse doesn't cause war** -- power disparities and a shared
contentment regarding status quo contentment between the US and other
major powers such as China prove

One of the contemporary issues in international relations is that [the
current hegemon, the United States, has undergone a relative
decline.]{.underline} It is argued that American hegemony that emerged
aftermath the Second World War is undergoing a decline and with the rise
of a potential challenger in China looming, one major issue concerning
IR scholars is whether or not the relative decline of US hegemony will
result in a hegemonic war. [Hegemonic wars occur when a rising
challenger]{.underline} -- revisionist power -- isn't content with the
current international order and wants to change it so as to [become a
preponderant force and dictate terms of a new world order.]{.underline}
This article assumes that **[although the US is in a relative decline it
is still a dominant power and the rising power is content with the
current status quo so no war occurs between the dominant and the rising
power.]{.underline}** In order to support the argument that a hegemonic
war does not occur, this article provides explanation using several
theoretical perspectives. Structural Realism and Balance of Power To
begin with, prominent neorealist Kenneth Waltz contends that [the end of
the Cold War has changed the structure of international
politics]{.underline} from bipolar to unipolar with the US being the
dominant power. According to Waltz, days of US being unipolar force in
world politics is numbered and slowly the world is moving towards
bipolarity or multipolarity because changes in the structure of
international system brings about changes in state behavior. It does not
matter how much self-restraint and self-control a preponderant power is
in its conduct of international relations; states are always wary and
fear the dominant power and thus he maintains that balancing is
universal. \[1\] In order to explain why, he has resorted to the Balance
of Power (theory). In most basic sense, international politics is a
state of anarchy where there is no central government and [states rely
on themselves to protect their autonomy and perpetuate their
survival.]{.underline} Balance of Power contends that states involve in
a balancing act to check the powers of preponderant force so that no any
single state has enough power to become a global hegemon. \[2\] **[With
the relative decline of US, China and America can enter into bipolar
relationship]{.underline}** much like the US and the USSR during the
Cold War. Since **[Waltz]{.underline}** himself **[posits bipolarity as
the most stable of international configurations]{.underline}**, it can
be argued that [act of **balancing** between the US and China brings the
international distribution of power into an equilibrium and **averts the
risk of war.**]{.underline} Socialization of Hegemonic Power Most
scholars posit that hegemons use threats and rewards to get compliance
from secondary states. Contrary to popular wisdom, scholars Ikenberry
and Kupchan have contended that in addition to material power, hegemons
also have the power of socialization to achieve compliance from
secondary states. They call this the socialization process which
involves 'altering of the belief systems' of elites. Basically, hegemons
project their vision of international order through normative principles
(norms and values) and not by material incentives; elites in secondary
states internalize them, and devise policies that are compatible to the
hegemon's ideal of the international order. The authors contend that
[**the world order thus created can sustain even when hegemon undergoes
a decline** because the world order created is relatively inexpensive to
maintain in the sense that altering of states preferences are by virtue
of ideals]{.underline} rather than use of coercion. Thus, by virtue of
socialization of hegemonic power, [relative changes in hegemon's
distribution of material power]{.underline} (military and economy) [does
not put strain on the international system.]{.underline} So, on viewing
the world from the lens of socialization, it can be argued that the
expansion of US normative principles on liberal economic norm to its
former allies and enemies aftermath the second world war that led to the
formation of the current liberal economic world order provides an
explanation as to why in spite of US' relative decline there is
continuity for America's liberal economic order. \[3\] The rising
challenger China can be considered to have been socialized -- it has
accepted US led international norms, and participates in various
International Organizations. Thus, [it makes less sense for China to
wage war against the hegemon whose ideals it has
internalized.]{.underline} Hegemonic Stability Theory According to this
theory, a hegemon creates a stable international economic order
characterized by market openness but its decline results in global
instability. This hegemonic effect of open trade benefits all
participants, especially, weaker states that do not have any burden of
public goods. In this sense, global economic stability is born out of
hegemony and provides provision of collective public goods and in doing
so facilitates a stable international system. The motivation to create
an economic openness lie in the interest of the hegemon -- it has the
largest economy and so benefits most from open markets. In addition,
only hegemons have the material capability (political and military) to
provide public goods and induce other states to embrace open trade.
\[4\] By virtue of the Hegemonic Stability Theory, the hegemon is an
important element in creation and maintenance of the international
system. As stated earlier, open trade benefits all participants, even
the rising challengers that are accommodated in the system. In
contemporary world politics, China is the fastest rising power and it is
also reaping the benefits of the open economic order created by the US.
By participating in the globalized economy, China has earned a
comparative advantage in labor-market and its economy has been growing.
On top of that China is an export-based economy and thus, it has very
little incentive to jeopardize this benefit by engaging with the hegemon
and thereby disrupting the order. In his article, Artur Stein has argued
that decline in hegemony does not bring about a complete collapse of the
trade regime as long as hegemonic power is committed to economic
openness. Taking these two points in consideration, it can be argued
that [it is not in the interest of China to challenge US
hegemony.]{.underline} On account, likelihood of war is averted. \[5\]
Robert Keohane and Institutionalist Approach In After Hegemony, Robert
Keohane uses an institutional approach to explain inter-state
cooperation. He posits that [states have common interest and in order to
realize it requires achieving mutually beneficial agreements which is
where international regimes come in.]{.underline} These regimes foster
cooperation by making it easier to reach mutually beneficial inter-state
agreements. They help overcome the problem of lack of qualitative and
asymmetrical information, through institutional embeddedness reduces
transaction costs, legal costs reduce incentive to cheat thereby
reducing uncertainty and building confidence among states. Since
hegemonic leadership is required to create regimes in the first place,
even after the erosion of hegemony, they have high stakes and play
important role in fostering cooperation (US role in the IMF and WTO).
Because cooperation fosters absolute gain, all participants are
benefitted. \[6\] By this approach, [states see cooperation more
beneficial than conflict.]{.underline} Thus, it can be argued from
institutionalist approach that **[international regimes foster
cooperation thereby reducing likelihood of conflict in the event of
hegemonic decline.]{.underline}** Conclusion The article provided four
distinct perspectives with regards to declining US hegemony and
potential of a hegemonic war. Using these approaches the article
concludes that [**in spite of decline in American hegemony there will
not be a significant change in the current structure of the
international system mainly due to power differentials between the US
and its nearest challenger China.** The US]{.underline} is undergoing a
relative decline but still, it [is the largest economy boasts strongest
military and has highest political leverage.]{.underline} In sum,
**[prospect of a hegemonic war in contemporary world politics is only a
far-fetched dream.]{.underline}**

#### Offshore balancing is the best foreign policy option for the US -- it preserves hegemony while using the least resources possible

[There is a **better way**. By pursuing a strategy of "offshore
balancing," Washington would forgo ambitious efforts to remake other
societies and concentrate on what **really matters**: pre­serving U.S.
dominance in the Western Hemisphere and countering potential hegemons in
Europe, Northeast Asia, and the Persian Gulf. Instead of policing the
world, the United States would encourage other countries to take the
lead in checking rising powers, intervening itself only when
necessary.]{.underline} This does not mean abandoning the United States'
position as the world's sole superpower or retreating to "Fortress
America." [Rather, by husbanding U.S. strength, offshore balancing would
**preserve U.S. primacy** far into the future and **safeguard liberty**
at home.]{.underline} SETTING THE RIGHT GOALS The United States is the
luckiest great power in modern history. Other leading states have had to
live with threatening adversaries in their own backyards---even the
United Kingdom faced the prospect of an invasion from across the English
Channel on several occasions---but for more than two centuries, the
United States has not. Nor do distant powers pose much of a threat,
because two giant oceans are in the way. As Jean-Jules Jusserand, the
French ambassador to the United States from 1902 to 1924, once put it,
"On the north, she has a weak neighbor; on the south, another weak
neighbor; on the east, fish, and the west, fish." Furthermore, the
United States boasts an abundance of land and natural resources and a
large and energetic population, which have enabled it to develop the
world's biggest economy and most capable military. It also has thousands
of nuclear weapons, which makes an attack on the American homeland even
less likely. [These geopolitical blessings give the United States
enormous latitude for error; indeed, only a country as secure as it
would have the temerity to try to remake the world in its own image. But
they also allow it to remain powerful and secure without pursuing a
costly and expansive grand strategy. Offshore balancing would do just
that. Its principal concern would be to keep the United States as
**powerful as possible**---ideally, the dominant state on the planet.
Above all, that means main­taining hegemony in the Western
Hemisphere.]{.underline} Unlike isolationists, however, o[ffshore
balancers believe that there are regions outside the Western Hemisphere
that are worth expending American blood and treasure to
defend.]{.underline} Today, three other areas matter to the United
States: Europe, Northeast Asia, and the Persian Gulf. The first two are
key centers of industrial power and home to the world's other great
powers, and the third produces roughly 30 percent of the world's oil. In
Europe and Northeast Asia, the chief concern is the rise of a regional
hegemon that would dominate its region, much as the United States
dominates the Western Hemisphere. Such a state would have abundant
economic clout, the ability to develop sophisticated weaponry, the
potential to project power around the globe, and perhaps even the
wherewithal to outspend the United States in an arms race. Such a state
might even ally with countries in the Western Hemisphere and interfere
close to U.S. soil. [Thus, the United States' principal aim in Europe
and Northeast Asia should be to maintain the regional balance of power
so that the most powerful state in each region---for now, Russia and
China, respectively---remains too worried about its neighbors to roam
into the Western Hemisphere. In the Gulf, meanwhile, the United States
has an interest in blocking the rise of a hegemon that could interfere
with the flow of oil from that region, thereby damaging the world
economy and threatening U.S. prosperity.]{.underline} Offshore balancing
is a realist grand strategy, and its aims are limited. Promoting peace,
although desirable, is not among them. [This is **not to say that
Washington should welcome conflict** anywhere in the world, or that it
cannot use diplomatic or economic means to discourage war.]{.underline}
But it should not commit U.S. military forces for that purpose alone.
Nor is it a goal of offshore balancing to halt genocides, such as the
one that befell Rwanda in 1994. [Adopting this strategy would not
preclude such operations, however, provided the need is clear, the
mission is feasible, and U.S. leaders are confident that intervention
will not make matters worse.]{.underline} HOW WOULD IT WORK? Under
offshore balancing, the United States would calibrate its military
posture according to the distribution of power in the three key regions.
[If there is no potential hegemon in sight in Europe, Northeast Asia, or
the Gulf, then there is **no reason to deploy** ground or air forces
there and little need for a large military establishment at home. And
because it takes many years for any country to acquire the capacity to
dominate its region, Washington would see it coming and **have time to
respond.**]{.underline} In that event, the United States should turn to
regional forces as the first line of defense, letting them uphold the
balance of power in their own neighborhood. [Although Washington could
provide assistance to allies and pledge to support them if they were in
danger of being conquered, it should refrain from deploying large
numbers of U.S. forces abroad. It may occasionally make sense to keep
certain assets overseas, such as small military contingents,
intelligence-gathering facilities, or prepositioned equipment, but in
general, Washington should **pass the buck** to regional powers, as they
have a far greater interest in preventing any state from dominating
them.]{.underline} If those powers cannot contain a potential hegemon on
their own, however, the United States must help get the job done,
deploying enough firepower to the region to shift the balance in its
favor. Sometimes, that may mean sending in forces before war breaks out.
During the Cold War, for example, the United States kept large numbers
of ground and air forces in Europe out of the belief that Western
European countries could not contain the Soviet Union on their own. At
other times, the United States might wait to intervene after a war
starts, if one side seems likely to emerge as a regional hegemon. Such
was the case during both world wars: the United States came in only
after Germany seemed likely to dominate Europe. [In essence, the aim is
to remain offshore as long as possible, while recognizing that it is
sometimes necessary to come onshore. If that happens, however, the
United States should make its allies do as much of the heavy lifting as
possible and remove its own forces as soon as it can. Offshore balancing
has **many virtues**. By limiting the areas the U.S. military was
committed to defending and forcing other states to pull their own
weight, it would **reduce the resources** Washington must devote to
defense, allow for greater investment and consumption at home, and put
fewer American lives in harm's way. Today, allies **routinely
free-ride** on American protection, a problem that has only grown since
the Cold War ended. Within NATO, for example, the United States accounts
for 46 percent of the alliance's aggregate GDP yet contributes about 75
percent of its military spending. As the political scientist Barry Posen
has quipped, "This is welfare for the rich." Offshore balancing would
also reduce the **risk of terrorism**. Liberal hegemony commits the
United States to spreading democracy in unfamiliar places, which
sometimes requires military occupation and always involves interfering
with local political arrangements. Such efforts invariably foster
nationalist resentment, and because the opponents are too weak to
confront the United States directly, they sometimes turn to terrorism.
(It is worth remembering that Osama bin Laden was motivated in good part
by the presence of U.S. troops in his homeland of Saudi Arabia.) In
addition to inspiring terrorists, liberal hegemony facilitates their
operations: using regime change to spread American values undermines
local institutions and creates ungoverned spaces where violent
extremists can flourish]{.underline}. [Offshore balancing would
alleviate this problem by eschewing social engineering and minimizing
the United States' military foot­print.]{.underline} U.S. troops would be
stationed on foreign soil only when a country was in a vital region and
threatened by a would-be hegemon. I[n that case, the potential victim
would view the **United States as a savior** rather than an
occupier.]{.underline} And once the threat had been dealt with, U.S.
military forces could go back over the horizon and not stay behind to
meddle in local politics. [By respecting the sovereignty of other
states, offshore balancing would be less likely to foster anti-American
terrorism.]{.underline} A REASSURING HISTORY [Offshore balancing may
seem like a radical strategy today, but it provided the guiding logic of
U.S. foreign policy for many decades and **served the country well**.
During the nineteenth century, the United States was preoccupied with
expanding across North America, building a powerful state, and
establishing hegemony in the Western Hemisphere. After it completed
these tasks at the end of the century, it soon became interested in
preserving the balance of power in Europe and Northeast Asia.
Nonetheless, it let the great powers in those regions check one another,
intervening militarily only when the balance of power broke down, as
during both world wars.]{.underline} During the Cold War, the United
States had no choice but to go onshore in Europe and Northeast Asia, as
its allies in those regions could not contain the Soviet Union by
themselves. So Washington forged alliances and stationed military forces
in both regions, and it fought the Korean War to contain Soviet
influence in Northeast Asia. [In the Persian Gulf, however, the United
States stayed offshore, letting the United Kingdom take the lead in
preventing any state from dominating that oil-rich region. After the
British announced their withdrawal from the Gulf in 1968, the United
States turned to the shah of Iran and the Saudi monarchy to do the job.
When the shah fell in 1979, the Carter administration began building the
Rapid Deployment Force, an offshore military capability designed to
prevent Iran or the Soviet Union from dominating the region. The Reagan
administration aided Iraq during that country's 1980--88 war with Iran
for similar reasons. The U.S. military stayed offshore until 1990, when
Saddam Hussein's seizure of Kuwait threatened to enhance Iraq's power
and place Saudi Arabia and other Gulf oil producers at risk. To restore
the regional balance of power, the George H. W. Bush admin­istration sent
an expeditionary force to liberate Kuwait and smash Saddam's military
machine. For nearly a century, in short, **offshore balancing prevented
the emergence of dangerous regional hegemons** and pre­served a global
balance of power that enhanced American security. Tellingly, when U.S.
policymakers deviated from that strategy---as they did in Vietnam, where
the United States had no vital interests---the result was a **costly
failure**.]{.underline} Events since the end of the Cold War teach the
same lesson. In Europe, once the Soviet Union collapsed, the region no
longer had a dominant power. [The United States should have steadily
reduced its military presence, cultivated amicable relations with
Russia, and turned European security over to the Europeans. Instead, it
expanded NATO and ignored Russian interests, helping **spark the
conflict over Ukraine** and driving Moscow closer to China. In the
Middle East, likewise, the United States should have moved back offshore
after the Gulf War and let Iran and Iraq balance each other. Instead,
the Clinton administration adopted the policy of "dual containment,"
which required keeping ground and air forces in Saudi Arabia to check
Iran and Iraq simultaneously. The George W. Bush administration then
adopted an even more ambitious strategy, dubbed "regional
transformation," which produced costly failures in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The Obama administration repeated the error when it helped topple
Muammar al-Qaddafi in Libya and when it **exacerbated the chaos** in
Syria by insisting that Bashar al-Assad "must go" and backing some of
his opponents. Abandoning offshore balancing after the Cold War has been
a **recipe for failure.**]{.underline}

**[Crisis Instability]{.underline}** Unfortunately, [the unipolar era
will not be totally free from conflict.]{.underline} Although
unipolarity precludes hegemonic rivalry, **[it may increase the risk
that crises between the United States and weaker nations will escalate
to war.]{.underline}**12 The reason is that U.S. military superiority
could embolden the United States to stand firm in a crisis while
simultaneously inciting weaker opponents to shoot first, in a desperate
attempt to stun the United States before the U.S. military wipes out
their offensive forces.13 Under unipolarity, this dynamic looms over
U.S. relations with all nations. It is most dangerous, however, with
regard to North Korea, China, and Russia, because these countries can
inflict apocalyptic damage on American cities and have ongoing disputes
with the United States over territory (e.g., Taiwan, Crimea, the Korean
Peninsula), the U.S. military presence abroad, freedom of navigation,
and human rights. In the years ahead, many events can, and almost surely
will, spark crises between the United States and these countries. A
primary goal of U.S. security policy, therefore, must be to reduce the
risk that such crises escalate to major wars. How? NORTH KOREA [The
North Korean case is the gravest]{.underline}, but also the simplest,
because the United States has no good options and only one nonhorrible
option: deter- rence.14 North Korea will never give up its nuclear
arsenal, which is its main insurance policy against a U.S. or South
Korean attack, and the U.S. military cannot reliably destroy North
Korea's nuclear weapons or conven- tional artillery before it has a
chance to use them.15 Deterrence may feel unsatisfying, because it
places U.S. security at least partly in North Korea's hands. Like old
age, however, deterrence only seems intolerable until one considers the
alternative.16 The U.S. Depart- ment of Defense estimates that a
U.S.-North Korean war would kill 20,000 people per day in South Korea
alone, even if no nuclear weapons were used. It also admits that [the
U.S. national missile defense system only has a 50 percent chance of
intercepting a North Korean ballistic missile headed for the U.S.
mainland.]{.underline}17 [Given these dire statistics, the United States
should learn to live with a North Korean nuclear
capability]{.underline}---just as it learned to live with the Soviet and
Chinese nuclear arsenals. Deterrence, however, does not mean doing
nothing. The United States should continue to make clear that it will
"totally destroy" North Korea if it attacks the United States or its
allies or transfers nuclear materials to other states or groups.18 To
back up these threats, the United States should inte- grate additional
terminal and midcourse interceptors to its national missile defense
system and develop boost-phase interceptors.19 It also should redouble
efforts to improve civil defenses and counterforce capabilities.20 These
measures will enhance America's ability to emerge from a nuclear war
relatively unscathed, and thereby hopefully deter North Korea from
starting a war in the first place.21 At the same time, the United States
should engage in diplomacy with North Korea and contingency planning
with China. North Korea will never negotiate away its nuclear arsenal,
but it might accept limits on that arsenal in exchange for U.S. security
assurances. The United States therefore should offer to recognize North
Korea as a nuclear weapons state, forswear mili- tary strikes, and lift
economic sanctions so long as North Korea abides by "three no's": no
additional nuclear weapons, no improved nuclear weap- ons or delivery
vehicles, and no export of nuclear materials.22 To compel North Korea to
accept this bargain, the United States needs to tighten sanctions on
North Korea, which in turn requires making a side deal with China.
Currently the Chinese government looks the other way when Chinese
companies smuggle goods into North Korea. China could crack down on
these violations, but will do so only if it feels assured that a North
Korean collapse, which would be made more likely by tighter sanc- tions,
would not result in U.S. forces swarming up the Korean Peninsula toward
China's border. Recent research suggests that China is willing to
abandon North Korea, but not if it means American troops on the banks of
the Yalu.23 The United States, therefore, should offer China a deal: in
return for full Chinese sanctions on North Korea, the United States will
let China dictate the terms of a joint contingency plan for a North
Korean collapse. As part of this plan, the United States would promise
to keep its troops south of the 38th parallel and offer to withdraw its
forces entirely from the Korean Pen- insula once the dust has settled if
China will accede to a U.S. alliance with a reunified Korea. The U.S.
military will probably hate this proposal, because it cedes con- trol of
North Korea's territory and nuclear sites to China without a fight.
Allowing China to secure North Korea, however, would keep U.S. troops
out of a potential nuclear hellhole and reduce the likelihood of a
U.S.-China clash.24 The geographic reality is that Chinese forces can
occupy North Korea before U.S. reinforcements even mobilize for an
attack---China has at least 150,000 troops perched on its border with
North Korea, which is only sixty miles from North Korea's main nuclear
sites and two-thirds of its mis- sile sites.25 Given that Chinese troops
will be first on the scene, the U.S. military should stay out of their
way. Instead of going to war with China over North Korea's carcass, the
United States should help China secure the area by providing
intelligence on North Korea's nuclear sites and technical expertise to
dismantle them. CHINA AND RUSSIA The situations with China and Russia
are less dire than the North Korean case, but more complicated, because
[China and Russia have more ways to hurt the United States]{.underline}
but also more to offer it. Even as the United States competes with these
powers for influence, it cooperates with them in numerous areas.
Adopting a policy of pure deterrence, therefore, would be shortsighted
and dangerous. Unfortunately, there is widespread disagreement among
strategists about what the United States should do to enhance crisis
stability with these two regional powers, aside from some fairly obvious
confidence building mea- sures, including codes of conduct for military
forces and for civilian aircraft and ships, backchannels for diplomats
to work out face-saving compro- mises, crisis hotlines linking the top
leaderships, military-to-military exchanges, cyber and nuclear risk
reduction centers, and joint peace and humanitarian operations.26 Some
scholars argue that the United States should simply retrench from East
Asia and Eastern Europe and grant China and Russia broad spheres of
influence.27 The most extreme of these proposals would have the United
States abrogate its alliances in Asia and Europe and pull its forces out
of both regions. Retrenchment has its appeal.28 Indeed, it seems the
logical, God-given strategy for a self-sufficient superpower protected
by two vast oceans. Yet [large-scale retrenchment not only would sap
U.S. influence in Asia and Europe]{.underline}, but also reduce crisis
stability by undermining deterrence.29 China or Russia might be
emboldened by a U.S. withdrawal from their regions and ramp up coercive
pressure on their demoralized neighbors. Successful security policy
requires a balance of reassurance and deterrence.30 Retrench- ment is
skewed too heavily toward the former. A better way to enhance crisis
stability while preserving the territorial status quo in Asia and Europe
would be to combine economic and political engagement with an "active
denial" military strategy.31 The overarching goal of this strategy would
be to create local "situations of strength" that raise the costs of
military aggression for China and Russia, but without backing them into
a corner.32 Such a strategy would have three main elements. First, the
United States would bolster the antiaccess/area-denial (A2/ AD)
capabilities of China and Russia's neighbors by providing them with
loans, arms, training, and intelligence. The objective would be to turn
China and Russia's neighbors into prickly "porcupines," capable of
denying terri- tory to China and Russia but not to take and hold
territory themselves.33 In East Asia, this means helping China's
maritime neighbors acquire advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles plus
the platforms and targeting capabilities to launch them. In Eastern
Europe, it means prepping the Baltic States to wage guerilla warfare.34
Second, the United States would create buffers between U.S. forces on
the one hand and Chinese and Russian forces on the other. American
forces would remain in Asia and Europe and roam wherever international
law allows, but they would be stationed in dispersed and hardened bases
scat- tered around the periphery of each region, where they could be
called on in the event of war but otherwise kept beyond the reach of
Chinese and Rus- sian forces. Decreasing the number of American soldiers
based near China and Russia's borders would reduce the likelihood of
incidents, help reas- sure China and Russia that the United States does
not intend to launch massive strikes on their homelands at the outset of
a crisis, and increase the resilience of U.S. forces in the region by
reducing their exposure to Chinese or Russian preemptive attacks. Third,
the United States would backstop the local balances of power in Asia and
Europe, but would plan to do so gradually. In minor conflicts, the
United States would try to convince China or Russia to back down by
using nonmilitary forms of coercion.35 As described in chapter 5, the
United States is uniquely empowered to impose painful sanctions and
embargoes on hostile countries (and to deny enemies the ability to
respond in kind) because of its central role in global banking,
plentiful energy resources, and unparalleled ability to disrupt
international ship- ping.36 In the initial stages of a conflict,
therefore, the United States could use financial sanctions, embargoes,
or cyber operations to try to achieve "victory without violence," as it
did in compelling Iran to negotiate curbs on its nuclear program and in
deterring Russia from annexing eastern Ukraine.37 If [the conflict
escalated to war]{.underline}, the United States could initially "lead
from behind," supporting local forces with logistics, intelligence, and
if absolutely necessary, limited air and missile strikes on Chinese or
Russian forces operating in the combat theater rather than those
stationed on the Chinese or Russian mainlands. These strikes could be
conducted from sub- marines, stealth-aircraft, or road-mobile missile
batteries---all of which are far less vulnerable to Chinese and Russian
A2/AD forces than surface ships, nonstealth aircraft, and ground forces.
If the United States needed to ratchet up the pain, it could escalate
horizontally before doing so vertically; that is, by opening up new
geographic fronts rather than throwing U.S. forces into the cauldron of
the main combat theater. This strategy obviously sacrifices military
effectiveness for crisis stability. The U.S. military could gain a major
advantage over China or Russia if it simply unloaded on their bases,
missile batteries, satellites, and radar installations at the outset of
a war. The U.S. military generally favors this type of knockout punch
strategy and for good reason: pinprick strikes and gradual escalation
invite a grinding war of attrition.38 Why give the enemy a chance to
fight back? [Offensive doctrines make sense against weak states that do
not have nuclear weapons. Against China or Russia, however, a military
posture primed for rapid escalation could be a recipe for
disaster.]{.underline} An offensive pos- ture not only risks turning
minor disputes into major wars, it also could turn conventional wars
into nuclear wars. Some of the systems that support China and Russia's
conventional military forces---missile batteries, radars, satellites,
submarines---also support their nuclear arsenals, so Chinese or Russian
leaders might mistake U.S. strikes on these systems as a preemp- tive
U.S. attack on their nuclear deterrents. Moreover, China and Russia have
declared that they would use nuclear weapons to retaliate against a
conventional attack on their homelands. Perhaps these declarations are
bluffs. But is it really so hard to imagine that, in the heat of battle
and when facing the potential annihilation of their militaries, one of
these nations might fire off a nuclear weapon in the hope of shocking
the United States into a cease-fire? Such a scenario might sound
alarmist, but Russia's mili- tary doctrine explicitly calls for using
nuclear weapons to "deescalate" con- ventional wars, and Chinese leaders
have suggested that the PLA is prepared to do likewise.39 In a
multipolar or bipolar world, it might make sense for the United States
to risk nuclear war to prevent a peer competitor from overrunning Asia
or Europe. Better to nip the problem in the bud than repeat the mis-
takes of Munich and empower aggressors. In today's unipolar world, how-
ever, no rival power is capable of going on a Hitler-style rampage
across Eurasia, so the stakes for the United States in a war there would
be moder- ate, and the main danger would be in doing too much rather
than too little. Instead of rushing into wars with China or Russia,
therefore, the United States should pick its battles, escalate
gradually, and let local actors do most of the heavy lifting. Imperial
Overstretch The theory of imperial overstretch holds **[that superpowers
tend to expand beyond their means and collapse as a
result.]{.underline}**40 Such overexpansion is driven in part by hubris.
As Christopher Layne explains: ["A hegemon eas- ily is lured into
overexpansion. When it comes to hard power, hegemons have it, and seldom
can resist flaunting it. Thus, we should expect a unipolar hegemon to
initiate many wars and to use its military power
promiscuously."]{.underline}41 In addition to hubris, **[superpowers
also tend to suffer from a pervasive sense of insecurity.]{.underline}**
As Robert Jervis explains: The very extent of the hegemon's influence
means that all sorts of geo- graphic and ideological disturbances can
threaten it. Frontiers can be expanded, but doing so just recreates
them. [Hegemony thus also ironi- cally magnifies the sense of
threat.]{.underline} The very fact that the United States has interests
throughout the world leads to the fear that [undesired changes in one
area could undermine its interests elsewhere.]{.underline} Disturbances
that would be dismissed in a multipolar or bipolar world loom much
larger for the hegemon because it is present in all corners of the globe
and everything seems interconnected.42 In short, **[superpowers tend to
become paranoid and militaristic, and these impulses, in turn, compel
them to expand abroad]{.underline}**---thereby creating more "turbulent
frontiers" to defend, interests to pursue, and threats to address.43
[This self-perpetuating pattern of expansion ultimately exhausts the
super- power's resources because "the costs of empire tend to rise
geometrically as its size increases, whereas its resources increase only
arithmetically."]{.underline}44 Is the United States doomed to follow
this historical pattern and fritter away its resources on reckless
adventures abroad? In the wake of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it
is hard to argue with the assessment that "the United States is becoming
the poster child for strategic overextension."45 Yet, U.S. overextension
is not inevitable. In fact, a clear-eyed recognition of the unipolar
distribution of power could help the United States temper its imperial
temptations. As the world's only superpower, the United States is
exceptionally secure and, therefore, can afford to play wait-and-see,
allowing threats to emerge fully before responding. This situation
stands in contrast to the Cold War, when anything that happened anywhere
in the world seemingly had impli- cations for the U.S.-Soviet power
balance. Allies had to be wooed and cod- dled to keep them from joining
the other side. Communist advances, even in peripheral areas, had to be
countered to maintain U.S. prestige and cred- ibility. Today, by
contrast, there are no dominos that must be kept from fall- ing, and
America's survival does not hang in the balance of the crisis of the
day. The U.S. military, therefore, can focus on first-order missions---
deterring major powers and rogue states that brandish weapons of mass
destruction---rather than playing globo-cop. The virtues of strategic
restraint might seem obvious, but they often are lost in U.S. foreign
policy debates.46 As Fareed Zakaria points out, the Amer- ican media and
some policymaking elites in Washington remain wedded to a Cold War
mindset that mistakes "activity for achievement."47 In this view, every
crisis abroad and every move by a foreign rival must be countered with a
robust assertion of American power. To do otherwise, some pundits and
policymakers argue, would abdicate American leadership, embolden
enemies, and demoralize allies. Better for the United States to shoot
first and develop a strategy later, they argue, then fail to intervene
at all. This misguided mindset has kept the U.S. military at war for
most of the past two decades---with little to show for it. Of the
campaigns in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, only the first could
be considered a clear vic- tory.48 The combined costs of these
conflicts---seven thousand American dead, fifty thousand wounded, and
\$6 trillion---hardly seem justified. To regain strategic solvency, the
United States should take three steps. First, American policymakers
should resurrect the so-called Powell Doc- trine and make it the
cornerstone of debate before every major military intervention.49 This
doctrine, which was originally developed by Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger in the 1980s and then elaborated by chair- man of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell in the 1990s, consisted of a series of
questions that had to be answered "yes" before sending American soldiers
to fight and die abroad: 1. Is a vital national security interest
threatened? 2. Do we have a clear attainable objective? 3. Have the
risks and costs been fully and frankly analyzed? 4. Have all other
nonviolent policy means been fully exhausted? 5. Is there a plausible
exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement? 6. Have the consequences of
our action been fully considered? 7. Is the action supported by the
American people? 8. Do we have genuine broad international support? The
core assumption of the Powell Doctrine is that [the United States rarely
needs to rush into war to keep itself safe.]{.underline} It is a
doctrine designed to conserve U.S. power, so that when vital interests
are threatened, the U.S. military can respond vigorously with forces
that have not been chewed up in wars of choice over trivial issues in
peripheral areas. In practice, the Powell Doctrine implies that the U.S.
military should focus on preparing for wars against China and Russia,
which are the only major powers not currently aligned with the United
States, and against North Korea, which is the only minor power that
currently has nuclear weapons and clear hostile intent toward the United
States. The U.S. mili- tary also can allocate some resources to killing
terrorists abroad, but this should be done primarily with special
operations forces and drones rather than large-scale military
occupations. The doctrine further implies that the United States should
avoid fighting wars where victory depends on controlling the politics of
chaotic countries. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown, local
leaders will rarely do what the United States wants if doing so
conflicts with their interests, and no reasonable amount of American
blood or treasure can change that fundamental fact.50 The United States
can support local allies in troubled regions with tools short of
military occupation, including diplomacy, aid, military training,
intelligence, arms, special operations raids, and drone strikes. In
general, however, the U.S. military should be allowed to focus on its
core competency---destroying enemy militaries---rather than being asked
to rebuild tattered nations. Second, Congress should reassert its
authority to regulate the use of force.51 According to the U.S.
Constitution, Congress is supposed to decide where and when the United
States goes to war. The president can order short-term military
interventions, but only when the nation's security is in imminent
danger. The United States followed this Constitutional principle for
most of its history. Since the end of the Cold War, however, Congress
has retreated from for- eign policy. It allowed the Clinton
administration to send U.S. forces to Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo without
congressional authorization; rubber- stamped the invasions of
Afghanistan and Iraq; and allowed the Obama administration to double
U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2009 without a vote and attack Libya in
2011 without a single hearing. In the future, Congress should subject
proposals for large-scale military interventions to public debate and a
formal vote. The foreign affairs com- mittees could lead the way by
holding hearings before each intervention and soliciting testimony from
a wide-range of experts. These hearings could be paired with trips to
the region in question, where members of Congress could meet with
political actors and journalists, researchers, and aid workers. These
practices were standard operating procedure in the 1970s and 1980s and
should become so again. Congress also should pass legislation limiting
the president's ability to launch a preventive or unprovoked nuclear
strike.52 The president should still be able to order retaliatory or
preemptive strikes, but preventive or unprovoked strikes should require
sober deliberation among multiple offi- cials. President Trump's casual
comments about nuclear war with North Korea underscore the risks of
giving him unchecked authority to order an attack. To reduce these
risks, Congress should require the unanimous con- sent of a small group
of officials---including the vice president, the secre- tary of defense,
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the four leaders of the
House and the Senate---for any preventive or unprovoked nuclear strike.
Third, the United States should institute a war tax for any military
opera- tions that require supplemental funding. For nearly 200 years,
from 1812 to 2001, the United States paid for its wars in part by
raising special taxes on individuals and corporations. These "pay as you
fight" taxes ensured that all Americans sacrificed for the common cause.
Since 9/11, however, the United States has paid for its wars by
borrowing, adding trillions of dollars to the national debt. This
practice of putting wars on the credit card is not just fiscally
irresponsible, it is dangerous, because people are much more likely to
support a stupid war if they do not have to pay higher taxes to finance
it.53 The flip side is that a mandatory war tax would make American
leaders more judicious about when and where to send U.S. forces into
battle.54 The three steps highlighted above would almost certainly
reduce U.S. military involvement in the Middle East. That would be
wonderful. The United States has three important interests in the
region---oil, counterter- rorism, and democracy---but none requires a
large U.S. military commit- ment. Instead, the United States should
adopt an offshore balancing strategy in the Middle East, limiting its
peacetime presence to a skeletal base structure, and put boots on the
ground only if a local power threatens to dominate or destroy the
region.55 The U.S. military does not need to guard Middle Eastern oil
reserves, because no state is powerful enough to seize them or seriously
disrupt world oil markets: Iraq's military has already been neutered by
the United States; Iran's military has been ground down by decades of
conflict and sanctions; Iranian-backed Shiite militias lack the heavy
forces and air defenses needed for large-scale conquest; and Saudi
Arabia's military is geared for internal security and air superiority,
not ground invasions.56 Iran could try to blockade the Strait of Hormuz,
where most of the oil flowing out of the Persian Gulf is shipped, but
rigorous campaign analyses suggest that Iran could destroy only twenty
oil tankers, a number far from suffi- cient to shock the oil market, and
the U.S. military could break an Iranian blockade with air and missile
strikes launched from over the horizon.57 A Saudi civil war could
threaten the free flow of oil, given that most of the Kingdom's
disgruntled Shia minority lives in the Eastern Province near the
country's oil production facilities. A mass uprising, however, is
unlikely, because Saudi Arabia's internal security forces are robust,
roughly 90 per- cent of Saudi workers are government employees that
depend on the mon- archy for their livelihoods, and the Saudi government
has huge cash reserves to keep the gravy train running during economic
downturns.58 Even if Saudi Arabia succumbs to civil war, sending U.S.
Marines into Mecca and Medina would not pacify the situation.59 The
United States also does not need a large military presence in the Middle
East to contain Islamist terrorism. All of the deadly Islamist terror-
ist attacks committed on American soil since 9/11 have been carried out
by U.S. citizens or legal residents, so bombing or occupying the Middle
East for the umpteenth time is unlikely to reduce the risk of attacks
further.60 Moreover, that risk is already extremely low: since 1991,
Americans have been four times more likely to drown in bathtubs than be
killed by a jihadi.61 The main battles in the war on terror should be
fought by U.S. intelligence agencies and domestic law enforcement, not
by the U.S. mili- tary. In this regard, the United States already does
more than enough: it has more than a thousand government organizations
and two thousand private companies engaged in counterterrorism, giving
it two counterter- rorism organizations for every Islamist terrorist
suspect it has ever arrested.62 Finally, the United States should not
use military force to promote democracy in the Middle East. If two
decades of nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan have taught us
anything, it is that the U.S. military can- not install liberal
democracy where powerful local actors do not want it.63 The United
States succeeded in democratizing Germany and Japan after World War II
only because their populations were war-weary and desper- ate for U.S.
protection from the Soviet Union.64 In the Middle East today, by
contrast, most people hate the United States and do not share a com- mon
enemy with it. They therefore tend to view U.S. troops stomping around
their homelands the same way the Vietnamese did in the 1960s. If the
United States is serious about promoting democracy in the Middle East,
it should reduce its support for corrupt authoritarian regimes there---
that is, by becoming less involved in the region---not by occupying more
countries militarily. Domestic Decay [According to a tradition of
political thought going back to Plato and Aristo- tle, **hegemons can
become victims of their own success and collapse from
within.**]{.underline}65 Having vanquished foreign rivals, various clans
within the domi- nant nation may turn on each other, resulting in the
weakening of national institutions and, in extreme cases, civil war.
This pattern---peace abroad fueling conflict at home---has been docu-
mented by numerous scholars, including Max Weber, Otto Hintze, Charles
Tilly, and Michael Desch.66 These scholars have shown that during
periods of great power competition nations tend to develop strong
bureaucracies and efficient systems of taxation and espouse a strong
sense of patriotism and national unity. [During periods of low external
threat, however, nation- states sometimes tear apart.]{.underline}67 For
example, the relatively tranquil interna- tional environment in Europe
from 1815 to 1853 (often called the Pax Britannica) witnessed an
unprecedented breakdown in state cohesion and a series of revolutions in
the late 1840s.68 Similarly, the benign external threat environment
enjoyed by the United States in the 1850s exacerbated internal tensions
that culminated in the Civil War.69 By contrast, during the World Wars
and the first half of the Cold War, American national unity rose and
government institutions expanded dramatically in scope and size.70
Recent trends in the United States fit this historical pattern: since
the col- lapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, partisan divisions in the
United States have surged to levels not seen since the Civil War, and
gridlock has become America's political norm, with recent Congresses
ranking among the most polarized and least productive in the post--World
War II era (figure 6.1).71 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% Moderation

Historically dysfunctional: polarization and gridlock in the U.S.
Congress, 1947--2013. Note: "Moderation" measures the proportion of
centrist legislators in the House and Senate (lawmakers whose floor
votes place them closer ideologically to the center of the chamber than
to their own party median), divided by the ideological gulf between
party medians. "Gridlock" measures the ratio of failed measures to all
salient issues on Washington's agenda. For an issue to be "salient," it
needed to inspire at least four New York Times editorials in a given
Congress. Source: Binder 2003, 2014, 2015. The 9/11 terrorist attacks
briefly brought Americans together, but the cama- raderie quickly
evaporated, a fact that suggests that **[the threat of terrorism is not
serious enough to mobilize the nation the way a genuine hegemonic
rivalry does.]{.underline}** If anything, the terrorist threat has
probably exacerbated divi- sions within American society by inciting
witch hunts for terrorist suspects and igniting vicious debates on
immigration, torture, war, and privacy. Without a unifying national
mission, Americans have sorted themselves into clans based on social
class and culture. Consequently, the two major political parties are
divided not just by policy preferences, but also by iden- tity. Rural
whites now overwhelmingly vote Republican while most minor- ities and
urban whites vote Democrat.72 This crude tribalism leaves little room
for compromise. If the partisan divide were merely about policy, the
parties could split the difference. Now that American politics has
become a clash of cultures, however, both parties view compromise with
the other side as immoral and dangerous. [For this reason, policymaking
in the unipolar era has lurched between grid- lock and partisan
overreach, and many of the problems highlighted in earlier chapters have
festered, including spiraling entitlement costs; crumbling infra-
structure; declining rates of upward mobility and entrepreneurship;
racially and economically stratified systems of education and
healthcare; a bloated and racially biased criminal justice system; a
convoluted tax code that incentivizes tax evasion rather than domestic
investment; and a crazy patchwork of federal, state, and local
regulations that benefit big firms with armies of lawyers rather than
small start-ups or public infrastructure projects. **If present trends
are not reversed, the United States may slip into a vicious cycle in
which partisan gridlock undermines public trust in govern- ment, which
incentivizes politicians to starve the government of resources and
authority, which leads to even poorer government performance, which
leads to more defunding of the bureaucracy. This downward spiral has
already begun.**]{.underline} Non-defense discretionary spending, a
category that includes everything besides interest payments on the
national debt and spending on entitlements and defense (e.g. spending on
education, infrastructure, transportation, R&D, housing, energy, envi-
ronmental protection, job training, food, agriculture, childcare,
justice, and international affairs), has shrunk to just 11 percent of
the federal budget, down from 25 percent in the 1960s and 1970s.73 As
journalist Ezra Klein has pointed out, the U.S. government is becoming
nothing more than an insur- ance company with an army.74 Such a weak
state might be great for lobby- ists and large corporations, but not for
the average American. [The United States thus faces a challenge: how to
tackle national problems without a foreign bogeyman to unite the country
and galvanize collective action.]{.underline} To meet this challenge,
the United States needs to empower a cen- trist American majority, and
doing that requires structural change to U.S. political institutions.

Having considered the above challenges to USA hegemony, it is also
important to outline the external challenges to the USA hegemony. [One
of the fundamental external challenges of the USA hegemony is the
problem of Nuclear Weapons.]{.underline} Such as those of [North Korea,
which continues to constitute a major hegemonic challenge and serious
concern for the USA in the international system because of its
belligerence toward USA and proscribed weapons technology including the
likes of armed intercontinental ballistic missiles which threaten the
homeland of USA by means of countering and thwarting any nuclear threats
from the USA and other warheads ballistic missiles. The Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1993 had no effective outcome on the
disarmament of North Korea]{.underline}. As such, North Korea still
continues to amass these weapons of mass destruction esp. after it
withdrew from the NPT in 2003 (Kim, 2010, p. 68). After this withdrawal,
North Korea became independent and not obligated by any international
agreement or law in the build-out of Nuclear weapons. Thus, this is
often portrayed as an intimidating remark to its neighboring countries
like South Korea which signed a Mutual Deference Treaty with the USA to
host thousands of USA soldiers (Mclnnis et al., 2017, p. 5). [A
challenge in this instance is that, in the call for North Korea\'s
denuclearization, championed by the USA in the international system,
nothing significant was done.]{.underline} Worse, North Korea maintains
that these weapons are for the purpose of deterrence (Bennett, 2010).
Hence, this has bestowed greatly to what is called "a
relationship-driven by crisis and mutual hostility" between North Korea
and the USA (Armstrong, 2004, p. 13). [Equally important is the issue of
Terrorism in the international system which has become the apparent and
continual trait of the post-cold war period.]{.underline} In the year
1995, terrorist activities were reinforced in the international security
environment (Jones & Smith, 2001). As a result, this had constituted a
major security challenge as they involved the killing of Rabin Yatzhak
(Prime Minister) of Israel, the bombardment of Riyadh (Co-joined
Military Centre) in Saudi Arabia, several bombardments in France, the
bombardment of the embassy of Egypt in Pakistan which indicated a new
epoch of Global terrorism which can be extremely severe and lethal than
any other security threat undertaking (Burke, 2016; CCN World News,
1995; Ephron, 2016; Reuters, 2017). Based on the Rand-St Andrews
Chronology of International Terrorism, at least 30,725 terrorist attacks
are recorded in the midst of 1990 and 1996 which make up an estimated
4,000 thousand on an annual basis (Jones & Smith, 2001, p. 11). [The
foregoing records show well that there had been a recorded
multiplication of terrorist attacks which make a huge security threat to
the world and USA as a Superpow]{.underline}er. Equally important is
[the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack which was recorded in the USA
in order to furnish that this has become a security threat to the USA
itself]{.underline} (Aras & Toktas, 2007, p. 1033). It was after this
attack that the then-president George W Bush made announcement declaring
a war on terror (Amadeo, 2019). Sen (2014, p. 29) argues extensively
that [globalization in combination with technological development had
contributed immensely to the growth of terrorist organized crimes and
terrorists in being able to perform terrorist activities very fast. They
can also plan and execute terrorist attacks in various countries at a
time, preserve collegiality in the times of challenges and also be able
to seize both lethal and advanced weapons of mass destruction in the
process]{.underline}. As a growing international security challenge, it
also questions the capability or effectiveness of the USA as a
superpower in the international system. As for Hoffman (1996, p. 79),
a[ll of these terrorist attacks symbolize and/ constitute a major
terminal threat than traditional terrorist enemies to the US
hegemony.]{.underline} One example of this is the Islamic State, which
constitutes a crucial intimidating remark to the international system
and USA. Arguably[, it is its religious reasons, which underpin a great
major concern to the global hegemony. The application and utility of
religion had "attracted a network of global supporters, and disrupted
international security with its campaigns of violence and
terrorism"]{.underline} (Blanchard & Humud, 2017). Thus the remark:
"ISIS is the outgrowth of broader global trends of Islamization that
stress the tensions between religiosity and modernity, compounded by an
increase in Islamic militancy" (Oosterveld & Bloem, 2017, p. 5). Another
significant aspect of this discussion is [interstate wars which make up
a great deal of international security threat too, to the USA hegemony
as they are often characterized by high volumes of refugees, Internally
Displaced Persons (IDPs) and widespread infrastructural destruction and
also the killing of innocent victims]{.underline} (Gesteyger, 1999, p.
69; Williamson & Simpson, 2011). The Rwandan genocide and Burundi\'s
civil war (in the early 1990s) and the Sudanese Second civil war
(1983--2005) and Darfur crisis (2003-ongoing) resulting in the killings
of thousands to millions of people are the relevant examples in this
instance (Daley, 2007, p. 333; Makki, 2004). The post-Cold War period
with the USA as the global hegemony has seen an increase in regional
violent confrontations of which to some extent included the
fragmentations of states and also the intensive civil war strifes
(Komlosy, 2016, p. 470). Both the South Sudanese Independence and the
fragmentation of Yugoslavia are relevant case points.

he first year of Joe Biden's presidency ended as it began, with the
[United States facing crises on **multiple fronts**]{.underline}. In the
spring of 2021, there were simultaneous war scares in eastern Europe and
the western Pacific, thanks to a Chinese intimidation campaign against
Taiwan and a Russian military buildup on the Ukrainian border. At the
start of 2022, the world was no calmer. [China's menacing maneuvers near
Taiwan continued. Russian President Vladimir Putin, having mobilized an
even bigger force near Ukraine, was threatening to start Europe's
largest war in decades. Meanwhile, Tehran and Washington looked to be
headed for a renewed crisis over Iran's nuclear program and its drive
for regional primacy.]{.underline} [Being a global superpower means
never having the luxury of concentrating on just one thing.]{.underline}
That is a rude lesson for Biden, who took office hoping to reduce
tensions in areas of secondary importance so that the United States
could focus squarely on the problem that matters most: China. [It also
indicates a larger weakness in Washington's global posture,]{.underline}
one that Biden now owns but did not create. [The United States is an
**overstretched hegemon**, with a defense strategy that has come out of
balance with the foreign policy it supports. Biden's first year has
already shown how hard it is to manage an unruly world when Washington
has more responsibilities---and more enemies---than it has coercive
means. Over the longer term, a superpower that fails to keep its
commitments in line with its capabilities may pay an even **heavier
price**.]{.underline} ASIA FIRST Biden's initial theory of foreign
policy was straightforward: don't let smaller challenges distract from
the big one. Of all the threats Washington faces, Biden's interim
national security strategy argued, China "is the only competitor" able
to "mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international
system." That challenge has become greater as China has accelerated its
efforts to overturn the balance of power in Asia. [When Biden took
office, U.S. military leaders publicly warned that Beijing could
**invade** Taiwan by 2027. Biden was not naive enough to think that
other problems would simply vanish.]{.underline} With trouble brewing on
this central front, however, he did seek a measure of calm on others.
Biden avoided another doomed "reset" with Russia, but held an early
summit with Putin in a bid to establish a "stable and predictable"
relationship. He also sought to find a path back to the 2015 nuclear
deal with Iran, thereby reducing the growing risk of confrontation in
the Middle East. Finally, Biden ended the U.S. war in Afghanistan, a
decision he justified by arguing that it was time to refocus attention
and resources on the Indo-Pacific. Relations with U.S. allies followed
the same pattern: the administration dropped U.S. opposition to the Nord
Stream 2 gas pipeline linking Russia and western Europe, wagering that
ending a contentious dispute with Germany would make it easier to win
Berlin's cooperation vis-à-vis Beijing. Biden's emerging defense
strategy has a similar thrust. [The Trump administration made a major
shift in U.S. defense planning, arguing that the Pentagon must
relentlessly prepare for a conflict against a great-power
challenge---particularly from China---even though that meant accepting
**greater risk** in other regions. Biden's Pentagon likewise spent 2021
focusing on how to deter or defeat Chinese aggression, withdrawing
scarce assets such as missile defense batteries from the Middle
East]{.underline}, and making longer-term budgetary investments meant to
"prioritize China and its military modernization as our pacing
challenge." TROUBLE EVERYWHERE Biden is undoubtedly right that the
Chinese challenge overshadows all others, despite unresolved debates in
Washington over exactly when that challenge will become most severe. His
administration has made major moves in the Sino-American competition
during its first year---expanding multilateral military planning and
exercises in the western Pacific, focusing bodies such as NATO and the
G-7 on Beijing's belligerence, and launching the AUKUS partnership with
Australia and the United Kingdom. [Yet Biden hasn't enjoyed anything
resembling a **respite** on other fronts. The U.S. withdrawal from
Afghanistan precipitated the **collapse** of the government there,
generating a near-term **crisis** that consumed Washington's attention
and leaving longer-term legacies---strategic and humanitarian---that are
likely to do the same.]{.underline} Meanwhile, a brutal internal
conflict in Ethiopia destabilized one of Africa's most important
countries. Most problematic of all, U.S. relations with Iran and Russia
became worse, not better. [Iran has taken a hard-line stance in
negotiations on a revived nuclear deal while steadily decreasing the
amount of time it would need to produce a **potential
weapon**.]{.underline} Tehran's proxies have also conducted periodic
attacks against U.S. personnel and partners in the Middle East as part
of an ongoing effort to force an American withdrawal from the region.
[Putin, for his part, has authorized or at least permitted significant
**cyberattacks** against critical infrastructure in the United
States.]{.underline} He threatened war against Ukraine in the spring and
has now mobilized forces for what U.S. officials fear could be a major
invasion and prolonged occupation of that country. [To preserve the
peace, Moscow has demanded an acknowledged Russian sphere of influence
and the rollback of NATO's military presence in eastern
Europe]{.underline}. What exactly Putin has in mind for Ukraine is
uncertain, but "stable and predictable" is clearly not how he envisions
his relationship with the United States. [These are **ominous** signs
for 2022. The United States could find itself facing **grave security
crises** in Europe and the Middle East in addition to persistent and
elevated tensions in the Pacific. And these possibilities hint at a
**deeper problem** in U.S. statecraft, one that has been accumulating
for years: **strategic overstretch**.]{.underline}

#### The US is backsliding now -- adversaries are taking advantage of overextension to gain power

This realization prompted a major change in U.S. defense planning. The
Trump administration's defense strategy declared that the two-war
standard was history. The U.S. military would henceforth be sized and
shaped to win one major war against a great-power competitor. The United
States would still be capable of "deterring" aggression in other
theaters, but, as a bipartisan commission that included several current
Biden administration officials pointed out, [how exactly the Pentagon
would do so without the capability to defeat such aggression remained
**ambiguous**.]{.underline} Shifting to a one-war standard was a
sensible way to motivate the lethargic Pentagon bureaucracy to find
creative solutions to the urgent, daunting challenge of war with a
near-peer rival. It involved a sober recognition that losing [a
great-power war could inflict a **death blow** on the U.S.-led
international order. Yet the 2018 defense strategy was also an
acknowledgment of **overstretch**: the United States could focus on its
primary challenge **only by reducing** its ability to focus on others.
This limitation is the root of the problem Biden has inherited, and it
has some **dangerous implications**.]{.underline} THE CREDIBILITY GAP
[The most glaring danger, highlighted by the concurrent crises in
eastern Europe and East Asia, is that the United States could have to
fight wars against China and Russia simultaneously. This would indeed be
a **nightmare scenario** for a one-war military. But it wouldn't take a
global security meltdown to reveal the problems caused by Washington's
predicament.]{.underline} First, [**overstretch limits U.S.** options in
a crisis]{.underline}. Where the United States should draw the line
against Russian aggression in eastern Europe, how hard it should push
back against Tehran's provocations in the Middle East, and whether it
should use force to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear threshold state
are matters that reasonable people can debate. [But the fact that the
United States increasingly has a China centric defense strategy has a
constraining effect in other theaters. If a U.S. president knows that
the Pentagon will need everything it has for an all-too-plausible war
with China, he or she will be less inclined to use force against Iran or
Russia, lest Washington be caught short if violence erupts in the
Pacific. This issue leads to a second problem: the **loss of diplomatic
influence** in situations short of war.]{.underline} Since the Taiwan
and Ukraine crises of early 2021, some observers have speculated that
[Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are coordinating their coercion
as a way of threatening Washington with a two-front war. The reality is
that explicit coordination is hardly necessary to **profit from U.S.
overextension**.]{.underline} [Leaders in Moscow and Tehran can see that
the United States is stretched thin militarily and eager to pay more
attention to China. This gives them an incentive to push Washington
harder in hopes of achieving gains at the expense of a **distracted
superpower**.]{.underline} [As the Russia expert Michael Kofman has
written]{.underline}, Putin's strategy of using military coercion to
revise the post-Cold War order in Europe is premised on his belief that
the "[greater threat from China" will eventually "force Washington to
**compromise and renegotiate**." The more intense its focus on China,
the higher the price the United States may be willing to pay for
**restraint in other places**. The **perils of overstretch**, however,
are not confined to secondary theaters. Weakness at the periphery can
ultimately cause weakness at the center. A decade ago, the United States
withdrew its forces from Iraq to economize in the Middle East and pivot
toward the Pacific. Iraq's subsequent collapse forced Washington to
reengage there, fighting a multi-year conflict that devoured resources
and attention. Similarly, if the United States finds itself in a
showdown with Iran or if Russia attempts to revise the status quo in
eastern Europe, Washington may once again find itself **pivoting away**
from the Pacific to reinforce under-resourced regions that still matter
to U.S. security. America's defense strategy is increasingly focused on
the Indo-Pacific, but its foreign policy remains **stubbornly global**.
That's a recipe for **trouble** all around.]{.underline}

#### America's hegemony risks imperial overstretch

**Fox 16** \[Justin Fox, Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist
covering business. A former editorial director of Harvard Business
Review, he has written for Time, Fortune and American Banker. He is
author of "The Myth of the Rational Market.", 6-13-2022, \"America\'s in
Danger of Imperial Overstretch", Bloomberg,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-07-13/america-s-in-danger-of-imperial-overstretch>\]//AA

[Twenty-nine years ago, historian Paul Kennedy coined the term
\"imperial overstretch\" to describe what happens to great powers when
their global commitments become too expensive to sustain. He also
suggested that the U.S., which at the time was in the midst of a
defense-spending boom under Ronald Reagan, might be overstretching
things a bit. A lot of the points Kennedy made]{.underline} in the
forward-looking final chapter of \"The Rise and Fall of the Great
Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000\" [seem
prescient today]{.underline}: The Soviet Union suffered from a much more
extreme case of overstretch than the U.S., he argued. Check. [The focus
of global economic activity was going to shift toward Asia]{.underline},
with China becoming one of the world\'s leading economies. Check. [The
U.S. would continue to be beset by fiscal deficits, disappearing
blue-collar jobs and declining relative economic power.]{.underline}
Check. Kennedy, a professor at Yale University, also seemed convinced,
though, that defense spending was going to represent an ever-growing
burden for the U.S. He wrote: [Great Powers in relative decline
instinctively respond by spending more on \"security,\" and thereby
divert potential resources from \"investment\" and compound their
long-term dilemma. Hasn\'t happened.]{.underline} Since Kennedy
published those words in 1987, the share of U.S. gross domestic product
going to the military has declined from 6.1 percent to 3.3 percent. The
amount of spending was almost exactly the same, in constant dollars, in
2015 as in 1987; [the shrinking of the military\'s share of GDP was due
entirely to economic growth.]{.underline} Still, military spending
didn\'t rise. It didn\'t rise because the collapse of the Soviet Union
brought an end to the Cold War, which led to outright declines in
military spending in the 1990s in the U.S. and around the world (all
these numbers are from the military expenditure database maintained by
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute): As you can see,
spending stopped declining in the late 1990s, then rose strongly over
the first decade of the new millennium. [That was partly because the
world\'s biggest military spender, the U.S., got involved in wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq]{.underline}, and because other post-Cold War
conflicts flared up in the Middle East and Africa. You can see evidence
of those wars in the list of countries that devote the highest share of
GDP to defense. 1 But global defense spending also rose in the 2000s
because global economic growth was strong outside the U.S., allowing
nations on the rise to invest in their militaries without overburdening
their economies. The most dramatic example of this was China, where
military spending rose more than tenfold, in constant-dollar terms, from
1989 to 2015, even as the percentage of GDP going to defense actually
fell from 2.5 percent in 1989 to 1.9 percent in 2015. 2 In the process,
China rose to second place in global military spending, with more than
twice the expenditures of No. 3 Saudi Arabia. [This is consistent with
Kennedy\'s rise-and-fall story. Countries with faster-growing economies
\-- in this case China and India, mainly 3 \-- are beginning to catch up
with the dominant great power.]{.underline} They\'re still miles behind,
India is increasingly looking like a U.S. ally and China doesn\'t seem
to have anything like the global military ambitions that the Soviet
Union did. But it is nonetheless possible to envision a near future in
which U.S. military spending as a share of GDP starts rising steadily as
perceived threats to the country\'s security grow faster than the
economy. Defense spending isn\'t all bad, in economic terms. Because the
U.S. makes its own weapons, buying more of them can have a stimulative
effect \-- although some economists argue that this effect disappears if
the purchases are made with borrowed money. There\'s a long history of
positive spillovers into the rest of the economy from military research
and development. And sometimes spending more money on defense is
essential to, you know, defend yourself. Still, Kennedy\'s \"security\"
vs. \"investment\" tradeoff has to come into play at some point. Is the
U.S. anywhere near it? Probably not yet. But [I can\'t see any reason
why we should be immune from imperial overstretch forever.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Trump 

#### The Trump administration's aggressive foreign campaign worsened the U.S.'s already severe imperial overstretch

**Heuvel 20** \[January 7, 2020, Katrina vanden Heuvel, Education:
Princeton University, BA in Politics, Katrina vanden Heuvel writes a
weekly column for The Post. She is the editor and publisher of the
Nation magazine. She has also edited or co-edited several books., "The
2010s were a decade of imperial overreach. Trump is making it worse.",
The Washington Post,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/07/s-were-decade-imperial-overreach-trump-is-making-it-worse/>\]//AA

With the 2010s over, now is a good time to consider what characterized
the United States' foreign policy of the past decade. Many establishment
voices have described the 2010s as a decade of American retreat from the
world. In fact, [**it would be more accurate to call the past decade the
"decade of imperial overreach" --- a major expansion of U.S. foreign
policy goals and power beyond what is prudent or constructive.** The
overreach began during the Obama years.]{.underline} Despite a
demonstrable reluctance on the part of President Barack Obama at times,
it was his administration, with strong congressional support, that
[extended U.S. foreign policy goals in the Middle East]{.underline} to
include regime change in Libya and Syria and increased containment of
Iran. It was the Obama administration that expanded the global war on
terror to more countries in the Middle East and Africa. In Eastern
Europe, the Obama White House, again with a huge assist from members of
Congress, helped participate in a coup against the duly elected (though
deeply corrupt) Viktor Yanukovych government in Ukraine and actively
pursued a campaign to pull Ukraine exclusively into the Western camp ---
and to eliminate Russian influence in a country that historically had
been closely aligned with Moscow. [In East Asia, the Obama
administration hyped a "pivot" to the region that was in fact simply an
expansion of the United States\' military and geoeconomic goals in the
Asian-Pacific region]{.underline}. It entailed not just the ill-fated
Trans-Pacific Partnership but new military deployments aimed at
controlling the sea lanes and trade routes in East Asia, upon which
China depends for its supply of oil and raw materials, as well as its
transport of manufactured goods. **[U.S. overreach has only accelerated
under President Trump.]{.underline}** Despite his campaign promises to
end forever wars and to pull forces out of the Middle East, Trump has
gone along with the national security bureaucracy and a sanctions-happy
Congress to extend the United States' foreign policy and military reach.
[In the Middle East, the Trump administration stepped up Washington's
"maximum pressure" campaign against Iran]{.underline} --- after
abandoning the Obama administration's successful, multilateral nuclear
deal. And with the assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani
last week --- without congressional approval --- [already-escalating
tensions between the United States and Iran have been raised to new,
extraordinarily dangerous levels.]{.underline} Incendiary rhetoric,
military brinkmanship and Trump's recklessness have brought us to the
edge of war. [Trump has also undertaken direct military strikes against
Syria and placed American troops in the country in an effort to control
the country's oil resources and to block trade with Iraq and
Iran.]{.underline} As part of its ongoing goal of countering Iranian
influence in the region, the administration has sought to increase its
influence in Lebanon and drive a wedge between Iran and Iraq's
governments. And, perhaps most ominously, it has increased the
deployment of U.S. troops and weapons systems to Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf region. More than 4,000 additional forces are already headed there,
with more promised. [The greatest expansion of American power and goals,
of course, has been reserved for the containment of Russia and
China.]{.underline} Trump's 2018 National Security Strategy named China
and Russia as the United States' greatest threats and committed to large
military buildups to counter their influence. The goal of the strategy
appears to have gone beyond deterrence and even containment to a form of
active pressure --- especially in the case of Russia. [This entails not
just the encirclement of Russia with U.S. and NATO forces but also a
strategy of weakening Russia economically and politically with more
stringent sanctions]{.underline}, such as those imposed against
international companies working on the completion of the Nord Stream II
pipeline. As in years past, [NATO has been the principal vehicle used to
advance Washington's ambitious goals.]{.underline} Despite fears that
Trump would act on his threats to dismantle the 70-year-old alliance,
[the administration has given it new missions]{.underline} --- a NATO
military buildup in Poland and the Baltic States, extension of the
alliance's ranks in the Balkans, adding space as an operational domain
and naming China as a security challenge for the first time. As a result
of these and other actions, **[the United States is now committed to a
new cold war on two fronts]{.underline}**, Russia and China, and
[perhaps three fronts]{.underline} when one adds the maximum-pressure
campaign against Iran. These have opened up several new geopolitical
theaters with expanded U.S. foreign policy goals. Under Trump, the goal
of U.S. foreign policy has expanded from controlling the traditional sea
lanes in the Euro-Atlantic, Asia-Pacific, and Middle East and Persian
Gulf to controlling them in the Arctic, as well. Also under Trump, [the
United States has greatly increased geopolitical ambitions in
controlling the world's energy markets.]{.underline} The expansion of
the United States' foreign policy goals does not, however, mean the
expansion of U.S. influence or greater U.S. security or economic
well-being. Indeed, [the United States' influence arguably has declined
even as its foreign policy ambitions have increased.]{.underline}
Historically, [**imperial overstretch does not end well**, and there is
ample evidence that Trump's foreign policy is failing nearly
everywhere.]{.underline} With this past week's offensive military action
against Iran, [it is clear the United States is not retreating under
Trump. It is expanding, and in often stupid, militaristic and dangerous
ways. **It is that expansion that most threatens our security and
economic well-being, and it is time that we begin to call out what is
happening.**]{.underline}

#### US heg is collapsing now -- Covid allowed Beijing to take the lead

University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1/29/21 (Alfred, "American Hegemony Is
Ending With a Whimper, Not a Bang", The Nation*,*
<https://www.thenation.com/article/world/trump-biden-america/>, accessed
6/26/22)//jd 

Once in office[, Trump soon bent the nation (but not the world) to his
will, rupturing time-tested alliances, tearing up treaties, denying
incontrovertible climate science, and demanding respect for American
authority with a thundering, if largely empty, rhetoric that threatened
military retaliation or economic reprisals globally.]{.underline}
Despite the manifest inanity of his policies, the Republican Party
capitulated, corporate tycoons applauded, and nearly half the American
public cleaved to their newfound savior. As with all sellout shows, the
best was saved for last. [When the Covid-19 pandemic struck with full
force in March 2020, Trump turned up at the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) in Atlanta, donning a MAGA hat, to proclaim his "natural ability"
when it came to medical science, while distinguished doctors stood by
like studio extras in mute testimony to his otherwise risible
claim]{.underline}s. As the pandemic began climbing toward its terrible,
still developing toll, Trump hijacked White House briefings by medical
experts to promote a succession of crackpot claims---wearing a mask was
merely "politically correct"; Covid-19 was just another flu that
"becomes weaker with warmer weather"; hydroxychloroquine was a cure; and
shining ultraviolet "light inside of the body" or injecting
"disinfectant" were possible treatments. A surprising number of
Americans started drinking bleach to protect themselves from the virus,
forcing months of public health warnings. A[fter nearly a century in
which the United States had been a world leader in promoting public
health, the Trump administration, to escape blame for its own escalating
failures, walked out of the World Health Organization. Lending the
country the aura of a failed state, the CDC itself, once the world's
gold standard in medical research, bungled the development of a
coronavirus test and so forfeited any serious, nationwide attempt to
successfully track and trace the disease (the most effective means of
controlling it). While smaller nations like New Zealand, South Korea,
and even impoverished Rwanda effectively curbed Covid-19, by the end of
Trump's term the United States already had experienced more than 400,000
deaths and 24 million infections---significantly above any other
developed nation's death rate and a full quarter of the world's total
cases.]{.underline} Meanwhile, Beijing mobilized a rigorous public
health campaign that quickly contained the virus to just 4,600 deaths in
a population of 1.4 billion. In only four months, [China virtually
eliminated the virus (despite periodic new local breakouts) and had its
economy humming along with a 5 percent increase in gross domestic
product, which accounted for 30 percent of global growth last
year.]{.underline} Meanwhile, after 11 months of an incessant pandemic,
the United States remained mired in a crippling recession. [This
striking disparity in state performance only accelerated China's quest
to surpass the United States as the world's largest economy and, with
all that financial clout, become its preeminent power.]{.underline} 

### 2NC\-\--US Domestic Collapse

#### Internal divisions and crisis are driving US collapse now

**Rapanyane 20** -- is a Lecturer of Politics & International Relations
at the North West University, Mahikeng Campus, and has an Ma in
International Relations from the University of Limpopo, 3/31/20 (Makhura
Benjamin, "The new world \[dis\] order in the complexity of
multi-polarity: United States of America\'s hegemonic decline and the
configuration of new power patterns", Journal of Public Affairs, Volume
21, Issue 1, accessed 6/23/22)//jd 

In this article, Hegemonic decline is defined as the hegemonic reverse
from one superpower to another one, while ensuring that there is a
military and political framework for the trans-border amassment of
capital (Komlosy, 2016). Thus, in order for one to grasp the whole
process, it is imperative to highlight and look into the principal
attributes that underpin this, therefore, to put it forward that [USA\'s
hegemonic decline owes deeply to the following: USA\'s deep internal
political cleavages, USA\'s inability to resolve the inflexibility that
exist between the Democrats and the Republicans (Ferguson, 2014).
Equally important is the acceptance that there is a decline and/ loss of
the manufacturing employment capacity of the USA which slowly denies the
country\'s industry of its principal role in the global economy as the
leading manufacturing employment economy in the world]{.underline}
(Skrabec, 2014). For statistical proof, the author was unable to place
figures in this document due to technical aspects. Thus, for the
readers\' confirmation of the latter assertion, they can see Bailey and
Bosworth (2014, p. 4) who have shown a figure depicting Manufacturing
Value added and employment as a Share of the Total US Economy,
1960--2011. [In making a quick document review of alternative scholars
in this subject, it becomes apparent that other internal challenges
including the outsourcing of the US manufacturing sector to the
economical production sites of the Global South which often result in
the emergence of the Newly Industrialized Countries]{.underline} (NICs).
These include the likes of South Africa, Brazil, China, India, Mexico,
Turkey, Thailand etc. (Komlosy, 2016; Majaski, 2019). The foregoing is
often epitomized by structural unemployment and social despairs which
often sabotage social peace in the USA that exists between the labor
force and the capital bosses. A case point would be the degeneration of
the Fordist welfare State in the early 2000s. [The 2008\'s Great
Recession also contributed immensely to the hegemonic decline of US,
which resulted in the USA promoting dictatorial leaders in other
regions. This was led heavily by the desire to intensify the problems
faced by other regions such as civil war victimization (in the Middle
East) and mineral resource curse (in Africa). Thus moving from promoting
and spearheading democracies to dictatorships in the world (Komlosy,
2016).]{.underline} Equally important is [USA\'s strong adoption of
privatization policies, which brought widespread practice of scams,
profit gaming systems and also corruption to only show some signs of the
Third World kleptocracy (Engelhardt, 2014). This had also projected USA
as a prospective Third World Nation. Another significant point to
consider in as the internal challenge is the issue of De-legitimization
of the Presidency and the US Congress (Jerusalem Center for Public
Affairs, 2019).]{.underline} This gained prominence in the year 2014
when the American confidence was proven at the polling outfits outlining
well that [Americans expressed the utmost confidence in the military
with 50% and the Supreme Court in the second with 23% and the presidency
in the third place with 11% and lastly was the Congress with
5%]{.underline} (Engelhardt, 2014). [The Congress and President have
been delegitimized to a point where they no longer possess the powers of
declaring a war against countries, which abuse human rights like
Syria]{.underline} (Lind, 2017; Nelson, 2016). In the process of
delegitimizing the president, a relevant case point would be that of
John Boehner\'s visit to Israel to sign the presidential deal with
Benjamin Netanyahu with a letter of support signed by 47 Republican
senators (Rudoren, 2015). The foregoing is also supported by the soaring
of [the National Security State]{.underline} as the fourth Branch of the
US government. This branch of government [is attested to be gaining
prominence and autonomy very fast]{.underline} (Engelhardt, 2014).
Equally important is [the branch\'s ability to be able to authorize any
of its desires with practically no resistance from Washington, which is
the continual feature of the contemporary US politics]{.underline}
(Engelhardt, 2014). Even though this fourth branch of government does
not get too much attention from the media house and the government, it
has become apparent that [this branch of government has taken over the
National Security State and incorporated it into its own, making it
stronger with "labyrinthine structure" and that this whole process shows
something very brand new in the American World \[dis\]
order]{.underline} (Engelhardt, 2014). [The other significant symptom of
US hegemonic decline is the issue of demobilization of the people of
America characterized heavily by abject poverty, inequality in wages and
the collapse of labor market in line with the society\'s
militarization]{.underline}. This process, started after world war II,
is partially explained by Operation Magic Carpet (Everipedia, 2019).
This process was initially enacted as a response to the rebellious and
disruptive Vietnam-era draftees[. This process involved the
prioritization of advertising agencies over the citizens\' army
resulting in the public being sent to their homes, to never again
interfere in the affairs of the military.]{.underline} Thus, this whole
process also led to the weakening of the National policy of the USA to
some extent, endangering the security of the USA nation (Everipedia,
2019). Having said that, it is important to highlight also that since
the early 2000s, demobilization has been entrenched and made a normal
thing for the security and safety of the people, but there are protests
which were motivated by the militarization of the policemen and women in
brown and black communities in the USA (Engelhardt, 2014).

American decline redux **[Today the military, economic, institutional
and ideational pillars that have supported the Pax Americana are being
challenged by China.]{.underline}** This raises two fundamental and
intimately connected questions: if China surpasses, equals or even
approximates the United States in these dimensions of power, can the Pax
Americana endure? And, if it cannot, what will replace it? Posing these
questions raises the contentious issue---contentious at least in the
US---of whether American power is, in fact, declining. During his
abortive 2012 run for the Republican presi- dential nomination, Jon
Huntsman---President Obama's Ambassador to China, and now President
Trump's Ambassador to Russia---succinctly expressed the prevailing view
of the US foreign policy establishment when he said: 'Decline is
un-American.' Leading US security studies experts agree. These
primacists argue that the extent of China's rise---and hence of
America's decline---are, like prema- ture reports of Mark Twain's death,
greatly exaggerated. Primacists believe the international system is
still unipolar, and that US power will keep it that way for a long time
to come. This claim is increasingly dubious. Indeed, [the case made by
the 'declinists']{.underline} of the 1980s---notably Paul Kennedy,
Robert Gilpin, David Calleo and Samuel P. Huntington---[looks stronger
every day.]{.underline}23 Contrary to the portrayal of their argument by
many of their critics, the 1980s declinists did not claim either that
America's post-Second World War power advantages had already dissipated,
or that the United States was on the brink of a rapid, catastrophic
decline. Rather, they pointed to domestic and international economic
drivers that, over time, would cause American economic power to diminish
relatively, thereby shifting the balance of power. In essence, [the
declinists believed that the United States was experiencing a
slow---'termite-like'---decline caused by fundamental structural
weaknesses in the American economy that were gradually nibbling at its
founda- tions.]{.underline}24 Kennedy himself was explicitly looking
ahead to the effects this termite decline would have on the US world
role in the early twenty-first century. As he wrote: The task facing
American statesmen over the next decades ... is to recognize that broad
trends are under way, and that [there is a need to 'manage' affairs so
that the relative erosion of the United States' position takes place
slowly and smoothly]{.underline}, and is not accelerated by policies
which bring merely short-term advantage but longer-term disadvantage.25
The unwinding of the Pax Americana [Decline may be 'un-American', but
that does not mean it isn't happening. Ameri- ca's 'unipolar moment' has
turned out to be rather---]{.underline}well, [momentary.]{.underline}26
The Great Recession that began in 2007--2008 did not end America's
unipolar ascen- dancy. It did, however, focus attention on, and
accelerate, the ebbing of American power---the evidence of which has
cumulated rapidly over the ensuing ten years. [This slippage of US
dominance is chipping away at each of the four pillars on which the Pax
Americana was erected: military power; economic power; institu- tions;
and soft power. **As these pillars erode, it becomes increasingly
doubtful that the Pax Americana can endure. China's challenge to
American military power**]{.underline} Until now the dominant view
within the US foreign policy establishment has been that military
strength is the one area in which America's advantage is insur-
mountable (at least within any meaningful time-frame). American military
power is considered by US policy-makers and many security studies
scholars to be the geopolitical trump card---no pun intended---that will
ensure continuing American dominance even if China closes the economic
and technological gaps separating it from the United States.27 However,
some within the foreign policy establish- ment are beginning to question
this viewpoint. Important recent studies of the Sino-American military
balance suggest that some analysts are taking a fresh look at the
question of how long it will take China to catch up with the US
militarily. China and the United States face different grand strategic
challenges. As self- styled global hegemon, America must be able project
decisive military power to the three regions it considers vital to both
its security and its prosperity: Europe, the Middle East and east Asia.
In contrast, [China's strategic goals, at least for now, are more
limited.]{.underline} China aims at dominating its own geographic
backyard: that is, it seeks regional hegemony in east and south-east
Asia, which have become the focal points of Sino-American geopolitical
competition. Even if China is not at present able to mount a global
challenge to the US, [there is evidence that it is beginning to draw
level with the United States in regional military power in east
Asia.]{.underline} In a recent report on the Sino-American military
balance, the RAND Corporation refers to the 'receding frontier of US
military dominance' in east Asia.28 According to RAND, the trend lines
in the Sino-American military rivalry in east Asia are not favourable
for the United States: **['Although China has not closed the gap with
the United States, it has narrowed it---and it has done so quite
rapidly.]{.underline}** Even for many of the contributors to this
report, who track military developments in Asia on an ongoing basis, the
speed of change ... was striking.'29 In a recent book, Roger Cliff, an
east Asian security expert at RAND, says that by 2020 China's military
establishment will be almost on an equal footing with America's with
respect to doctrine, equipment, personnel and training (though still
lagging behind in organizational structure, logistics and organizational
culture). Consequently, he predicts that by 2020 [American military
dominance in east Asia will be significantly eroded.]{.underline}30 He
predicts that the 2020s will witness a power transition in east Asia and
that at this point China will be able to challenge the regional status
quo.31 **[American economic decline and the impairment of US economic
hegemony]{.underline}** During the past decade, [signs of waning US
economic power---and China's growing economic muscle---have become too
numerous to ignore.]{.underline} Since the onset of the Great Recession,
[China has successively taken top position in the world in exports
(passing Germany); in trade (passing the United States); and in
manufacturing (claiming a title the United States had held for a
century).]{.underline} In 2014 the World Bank made the stunning
announcement that **[China]{.underline}** had **[vaulted past the United
States to become the world's largest economy]{.underline}** (measured by
purchasing power parity (PPP);32 and in the early to mid-2020s [China is
predicted to overtake the United States in GDP]{.underline} measured by
market exchange rate.33 These shifts in the relative economic power of
China and the United States have enormous economic and geopolitical
implications. Indeed, in July 2017 Christine Lagarde, managing director
of the IMF, stated that in ten years' time the organization's headquar-
ters---which are required by its by-laws to be located in its member
country with the largest economy---could be in Beijing.34 Taken
together, [these indicators paint a clear picture of relative economic
decline.]{.underline} American primacists have advanced a number of
clever but unconvincing arguments in an attempt to downplay the
significance of the ongoing economic power shift from America to China.
For example, some primacists assert that per capita GDP is a better
yardstick of national power than aggregate GDP; that newly developed
metrics of national power have diminished the importance of GDP as a
measure of a state's economic power; that China is far behind the United
States in advanced technology; and that China is incapable of doing
innovation.35 This last claim is ubiquitous among primacists.36 It is,
however, undermined by recent developments. For example, in September
2016 China began operating the world's largest radio telescope, which is
intended to project China's ambitions deep into the universe, and bring
back the kind of dramatic discoveries that win honours such as Nobel
Prizes.37 In August 2016 China launched the world's first quantum
satellite, which could lead 'to new, completely different methods for
transmitting information'.38 In another example of how China is catching
up with the United States in innovation and technology, in June 2016 a
Chinese computer (using made-in-China microprocessors) topped the
ranking of the world's fastest supercomputers.39 In July 2017 China's
State Council announced an ambitious plan to sprint to the front of the
pack in artificial intelligence (AI), including both military and
civilian applications.40 Indeed, The Economist recently observed that
already 'China could be a close second to America---and perhaps even
ahead of it---in some areas of AI'.41 And China is moving to the
forefront in green technologies (solar panels and wind-generated power)
and in electric cars.42 The waning of US economic dominance may not be
obvious to primacists, but it is perfectly apparent to many observers in
the real world.43 The weakening of US relative economic power, which
became unmistakably clear during the Great Recession, has undercut the
Pax Americana both by compromising the United States' ability to manage
the international economy and by shifting the Sino- American
geopolitical balance in east Asia. During the Great Recession it became
evident that in some (not all) respects the United States was unable to
fulfil its responsibility as the international economy's manager. After
all, an economic hegemon is supposed to solve global economic crises,
not cause them. But it was the freezing up of the US financial system
triggered by the sub-prime mortgage crisis that plunged the global
economy into hot water. The economic hegemon is supposed to be the
lender of last resort in the international economy. The United States,
however, has become the borrower of first resort---the world's largest
debtor. When the global economy falters, the economic hegemon is
supposed to jump-start recovery by purchasing other nations' goods. From
the end of the Second World War until the Great Recession struck, it was
America's willingness to consume foreign goods that constituted the
primary firewall against global economic downturns. [When the Great
Recession hit, however, the US economy proved too infirm to lead the
global economy back to health. It fell to China]{.underline} to pull the
global economy out of its nose-dive by stepping up to the plate with a
massive stimulus programme. Barack Obama acknowledged the deeper
implications of this when, at the April 2009 G20 meeting in London, he
conceded that, in important respects, the United States' days as the
economic hegemon were numbered because it was too deeply in debt to
continue as the world's consumer of last resort. Instead, he said, the
world would have to look to China (and other emerging market states,
plus Germany) to be the motors of global recovery. 'If there is going to
be renewed growth,' Obama stated, 'it can't just be the United States as
the engine, everybody is going to have to pick up the pace.' He added
that in some ways the world has become accustomed to the United States
being a voracious consumer market and the engine that drives a lot of
economic growth worldwide. And I think that in the wake of the crisis,
even as we're doing stimulus, we have to take into account our own
deficits.44 Another example of the slipping US grip on global economic
leadership is Washington's inability to prevail over Germany in the
transatlantic 'austerity versus stimulus' debate that began in 2009.
Reflecting their different historical experiences, the United States and
Germany adopted divergent fiscal policies during the Great Recession.
Economic policy-makers in the Obama administra- tion were guided by the
Keynesian lessons learned from the Great Depression of the 1930s: in
essence, that to dig out of a deep economic slump, the federal
government should stimulate demand by pump-priming the economy through
deficit spending, and the Federal Reserve should support this policy of
stimulus with low interest rates and easy money. Obama administration
policy-makers, and leading American economists, were haunted by the
'1937 analogy'---the fear that, if stimulus is withdrawn prematurely,
nascent recovery could be aborted. On the other hand, Germany---the EU's
economic engine---has long been haunted by the '1923 analogy'---the fear
that inflation easily can become uncon- trollable, with potentially
disastrous economic, social and political consequences.45 From the
founding of West Germany after the Second World War until the advent of
European monetary union, and eventually the euro, the primary missions
of the West German central bank, the Bundesbank were to combat
inflation, and to preserve the Deutschmark's value. For the German
government, assurance that the new European Central Bank would follow
the Bundesbank's sound money policy was a sine qua non for its decision
to give up the Deutschmark in favour of the euro. The US--European
divide on austerity versus stimulus manifested itself at the April 2009
London G20 summit. The US objective at this meeting was to achieve a
rebalancing of the international economy by inducing the
Europeans---which meant Germany---to lift the continent out of recession
by emulating Washington's use of deficit spending to spur economic
revival. Washington wanted Germany to export less and import---and
consume---more. Berlin flatly rejected US entreaties with respect to
rebalancing. German Chancellor Angela Merkel argued that for
states---especially ones already deeply in debt---to accumulate more
debt in an effort to spend themselves out of recession would only set
the stage for an even greater crisis down the road.46 Washington's
inability to persuade Berlin to adopt a policy of economic stimulus
highlighted America's flagging ability to act as the leader of the
interna- tional economy. The then Treasury Secretary Jack Lew implicitly
admitted this at the October 2015 IMF--World Bank biannual meetings
when, echoing President Obama, he stated that the United States could
not be the 'sole engine' of global growth. And the Trump administration,
although it has complained loudly that Germany exports too much and
imports too little, has like its predecessor been unable to push or
persuade Berlin into reducing its trade surplus while simultane- ously
increasing its consumption. Even as the US ability to manage the
international economy is decreasing, China's growing economic clout has
profound implications for the Sino-American strategic balance. For
example, the Obama administration's 'pivot' to Asia was intended to
reassure the nations of east and south-east Asia that the United States
would use its military power to offset China's growing economic
influence in the region. As Jeffrey Bader, the Obama administration's
National Security Council director for Asia, put it: China's emergence,
China's rise, is the focus of attention not only of the United States
but among all countries in the region. None of them wants to have
hostile or adversarial relations with China. At the same time, none
wants to be dominated by China. The countries in the region welcome the
US presence as, if you will, a kind of balance against China.47 However,
the outlook for this 'balancing' strategy is clouded. Doubtless, Bader
was correct: regional states do not want to be forced to choose between
aligning either with China or with the United States. But economic
trends suggest that they will be inexorably drawn into Beijing's
geopolitical orbit by the overpow- ering magnetic pull of the Chinese
economy. The lessening of America's regional economic influence, and the
corresponding jump in that of China, have been dramatic. In 1993 China
accounted for only 2 per cent of ASEAN's trade in goods, and the United
States accounted for 18 per cent. By 2013, however, the American share
of ASEAN trade in goods had shrunk to 8.2 per cent while China's had
skyrocketed to 14 per cent.48 Growing economic dependence on China is
reflected in geopolitical alignments. Since 2016, Malaysia, Cambodia,
Myanmar and the Philippines have all tilted away from the United States
and towards China. Even Australia, long a staunch US ally, is debating
the merits of taking a more equidistant political stance between
Washington and Beijing because of its economic dependence on China. In
the coming years these trends are likely to continue, and China will be
able to leverage its economic power to enhance its geopolitical position
in east and south-east Asia---and diminish that of the United States.
The institutional challenge to the Pax Americana [Not only is the **Pax
Americana** being **whittled away by** constraints on Washing- ton's
ability to continue playing its role as the manager of the global
economy, and by **China's ever-increasing economic dominance** of its
region; even more strikingly, **the institutional framework is being
challenged.**]{.underline} An important indicator of the Pax Americana's
erosion is the weakening of its legacy institutions amid calls,
magnified by the Great Recession, for a major overhaul of the
international institutional order. Examples include demands that the IMF
and World Bank be reformed to give China (and other key emerging market
economies) greater voting power, and a (so far unsuccessful) push to
expand the membership of the UN Security Council by adding, among
others, Brazil and India. Another indicator of the shifting global
balance occurred in November 2008 when the G8 global economic summit was
transformed into the G20 by the addition of China and other emerging
market states including India, Indonesia and South Africa. The G20's
creation as the new focal point for coordinating international economic
policy was a response to the insistence of China, and the other major
emerging market states, that they be given a greater voice in interna-
tional economic affairs. Implicitly, the G20's emergence confirmed three
trends. First, the necessity of conceding power to the emerging market
states---especially China---confirmed that America's relative power is
declining. Second, the G20's empowerment underscored the shift in power
from the Euro-Atlantic world to Asia. Whereas only one Asian nation (
Japan) had been a G8 member, the G20 has six members from the region:
Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea. Finally, the
G20's emergence as the central organ of international economic
management demonstrated that---as a result of the Great Recession--- the
prestige and authority of the United States and Europe as stewards of
the international economy had slipped dramatically.49 [The past decade
or so also has seen the creation of new institutions that potentially
could constitute a parallel---'shadow'---international order outside the
framework of the Pax Americana.]{.underline} The most important of these
may be the Beijing- backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
Other examples include the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the
Collective Security Treaty Organiza- tion, the Eurasian Economic Union
and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). The staying
power and impact of these institutions are uncertain; but at the very
least they are important symbolically. They underscore the decline of
the American-designed post-Second World War international order, and the
rise of new powers such as China and India---and the resurgence of old
ones such as Russia---demanding recognition of their status and
prestige, and a concomitant voice in the management of the international
system. Soft power: the end of the US monopoly [One of the major impacts
of the Great Recession was its effect on perceptions of US soft power.
As Martin Wolf argued at the nadir of the meltdown, the collapse of the
American financial system marked a 'humiliating end to the "unipolar
moment"'.]{.underline}50 [The meltdown has also damaged America's status
and ideational power.]{.underline} As Martin Jacques has suggested, the
fact 'that the American-run interna- tional economic system has been
plunged into such turmoil as a result of a crisis which had its origins
in the United States has served further to accentuate the loss of
American power and prestige'.51 US claims that the so-called Washington
Consensus---based on free markets, democracy and globalization---is the
only viable path for economic and political development have been
discredited. As former US Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman said,
the Great Recession 'put the American model of free market capitalism
under a cloud'.52 In the wake of the meltdown, China has broken the US
monopoly on soft power.53 Beijing has become increasingly adept at
developing its own brand of soft power based on its culture, its
diplomacy and the attractiveness of its own system--- 'market
authoritarianism'---as an alternative to the American model.54 Indeed,
even before the crash, Kurt Campbell and Michele Flournoy---both of whom
would go on to hold senior national security positions in the Obama
administra- tion---acknowledged that China, despite not being a
democracy, might already have leapt ahead of the United States in soft
power. This was, they observed, 'a troubling indictment of our current
course'.55 China's challenge to the Pax Americana: the AIIB, and 'one
belt, one road' In May 2016 leaders of 29 nations, and representatives
from some 80 others, descended on Beijing to discuss [China's ambitious
'one belt one road' (OBOR) development initiative---also referred to by
some as the 'new Silk Road'. This plan is the follow-on to China's
creation several years ago of the AIIB, conceived as a new major
international institution to foster economic development in south-east,
south-west and central Asia.]{.underline} OBOR---a signature policy of
Chinese President Xi Jinping---calls for the investment of massive
amounts of money (US\$1 trillion, according to some reports) to promote
trade and economic devel- opment by constructing transport links that
will tie together east Asian manufac- turing hubs with markets and raw
material suppliers in south-east Asia, central Asia, south-west Asia and
Africa.56 These new transport routes will also connect China and the
participating Asian nations with Europe---thereby creating new markets
for the goods and services it produces. Some analysts regard the devel-
opmental aspects of OBOR as a Chinese version of the post-1945 Marshall
Plan (albeit on a much grander scale). OBOR is also seen as an
instrument for extending China's geopolitical influence---especially in
central Asia. Indeed, it has been suggested that OBOR is part of a
strategy of establishing Beijing's dominance over the Eurasian
'heartland', to use the term favoured by the early twentieth- century
British geopolitical theorist Sir Halford Mackinder, who argued that
control of the heartland was the key to dominating the international
system.57 Since the early 1940s, leading American policy-makers and
academic strategists have---explicitly or implicitly---embraced
Mackinder's ideas about geopolitics.58 The AIIB and OBOR are both
indicators of receding US power, and they challenge the Pax
Americana---not just geopolitically, but also with respect to
international economic leadership and international institutions.
Beijing envisions the AIIB as a rival to the IMF and World Bank. In
discussions of Sino-American rivalry, less attention is usually paid to
these issues than to the military balance between the United States and
China, or to the flashpoints---the South China Sea, the East China Sea,
Taiwan, the Korean peninsula---that could spark a conflict. But [the
contest for international economic and financial leadership, and for the
guiding hand in reconfiguring the twenty-first century's international
institutions, will also shape relations between Washington and Beijing,
and help determine the fate of the Pax Americana. The diminution of US
influence---itself a signal of the Pax Americana's erosion---was
underscored by Washington's inability to derail China's plans to create
the AIIB.]{.underline} This failure was not for lack of effort. When
Beijing rolled out its AIIB plans, the Obama administration kicked into
high gear diplomatically in an attempt to quash the project. As the New
York Times reported, Washington 'lobbied against the \[AIIB\] with
unexpected determination and engaged in a vigorous campaign to persuade
important allies to shun the project'.59 Washington's attempt to
dissuade its allies from joining the AIIB failed. Or, to put it more
bluntly, in the face of China's growing power, the United States could
not keep its allies onside. The dam burst when, in a decision taken
fittingly on the Ides of March in 2015, Britain---ostensibly America's
closest ally---announced it was going to become a member of the AIIB (Et
tu, Britain?). London's action set off a stampede as other states that
previously had been on the fence rushed to sign up for membership in the
new institution. Those joining the AIIB included traditional US allies
such as Australia, France, Germany, Italy and South Korea. Beijing's
diplomatic coup in attracting widespread support for its AIIB initiative
was viewed---correctly--- as a direct challenge to America's global
geopolitical and economic leadership. Writing in the Financial Times,
former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that London's AIIB
decision and its aftermath 'may be remembered as the moment the United
States lost its role as the underwriter of the global economic
system'.60 Beijing's ability to persuade America's allies to sign up to
the AIIB also was a concrete demonstration of the lure of China's
financial and economic clout. **[China's AIIB initiative is important
because it represents a double-barrelled challenge simultaneously to US
leadership of the global economy and to the Pax Americana's
institutional (and ideational) foundations.]{.underline}** At the 1944
Bretton Woods Conference, the United States took the lead in
constructing the struc- ture of the post-Second World War international
economy by creating the IMF and the World Bank, which were intended to
anchor the postwar international economic system. Both of these
institutions were structured to ensure Washington would have veto power
over their decisions. As China's importance in the world economy grew,
however, Beijing demanded that voting power in the two Bretton Woods
institutions be recalibrated. In April 2010, the IMF and World Bank
agreed to increase China's voting weight. However, to become effective,
this agreement required approval by the US Congress; and the Obama
administration was unable to persuade Congress to enact the necessary
legislation until January 2016. Beijing's frustration with the stalemate
on voting rights helped drive its decision to launch its AIIB
initiative.61 With the AIIB, Beijing seeks to enhance China's roles both
in the management of the international economy and in international
development. The AIIB was also intended to signal that China was serious
in demanding an increase in its voting power in the IMF and World Bank
commensurate with its current economic and financial clout. The AIIB
is---and is intended to be---a direct challenge to the primacy of both
of these Bretton Woods legacy institutions.62 At the same time its
impact reaches beyond international economic affairs, because it signals
that **[the Sino-American balance of power now is tilting towards
Beijing.]{.underline}**

THE THREE PILLARS OF US GLOBAL POWER In the late 1990s, at the absolute
apex of US global hegemony, President Jimmy Carter's National Security
Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, far more astute as an armchair analyst than
an actual practitioner of geopolitics, issued a stern warning about the
three pillars of power necessary to preserve Washington's global
control. First, t[he United States must avoid the loss of its strategic
European "perch]{.underline} on the Western periphery" of Eurasia. Next,
[it must block the rise of "an assertive single entity" across the
continent's massive "middle space" of Central Asia]{.underline}. And
finally, [it must prevent "the expulsion of America from its offshore
bases" along the Pacific littoral.]{.underline} Drunk on the heady
elixir of limitless global power following the implosion of the Soviet
Union in 1991, Washington's foreign-policy elites made increasingly
dubious decisions that led to a rapid decline in their country's
dominance. In an act of supreme imperial hubris, born of the belief that
they were triumphantly at the all-American "end of history," Republican
neoconservatives in President George W. Bush's administration invaded
and occupied first Afghanistan and then Iraq, convinced that they could
remake the entire Greater Middle East, the cradle of Islamic
civilization, in America's secular, free-market image (with oil as their
repayment). After an expenditure of nearly \$2 trillion on operations in
Iraq alone and nearly 4,598 American military deaths, all Washington
left behind was the rubble of ruined cities, more than 200,000 Iraqi
dead, and a government in Baghdad beholden to Iran. The official US Army
history of that war concluded that "an emboldened and expansionist Iran
appears to be the only victor." Meanwhile, China spent those same
decades building industries that would make it the workshop of the
world. In a major strategic miscalculation, Washington admitted Beijing
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, bizarrely confident that
a compliant China, home to nearly 20% of humanity and historically the
world's most powerful nation, would somehow join the global economy
without changing the balance of power. "Across the ideological
spectrum," as two former Obama administration officials later wrote, "we
in the U.S. foreign policy community shared the underlying belief that
U.S. power and hegemony could readily mold China to the United States'
liking." A bit more bluntly, former national security adviser H.R.
McMaster concluded that Washington had empowered "a nation whose leaders
were determined not only to displace the United States in Asia, but also
to promote a rival economic and governance model globally." During the
15 years after it joined the WTO, Beijing's exports to the United States
grew nearly fivefold to \$462 billion while, by 2014, its foreign
currency reserves surged from just \$200 billion to an unprecedented \$4
trillion, a vast treasure it used to launch its trillion-dollar "Belt
and Road Initiative" (BRI), aimed at uniting Eurasia economically
through newly built infrastructure. In the process, Beijing began a
systematic demolition of Brzezinski's three pillars of US geopolitical
power. THE FIRST PILLAR---EUROPE [Beijing has scored its most surprising
success so far in Europe, long a key bastion of American global
power]{.underline}. As part of a chain of 40 commercial ports it's been
building or rebuilding around Eurasia and Africa, [Beijing has purchased
major port facilities in Europe]{.underline}, including outright
ownership of the Greek port of Piraeus and significant shares in those
of Zeebrugge in Belgium, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and Hamburg,
Germany. After a state visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019,
Italy became the first G-7 member to officially join the BRI agreement,
subsequently signing over a portion of its ports at Genoa and Trieste.
Despite Washington's strenuous objections, in 2020, [the European Union
and China also concluded a draft financial services agreement that, when
finalized in 2023, will more fully integrate their banking
systems.]{.underline} While China is building ports, rails, roads, and
powerplants across the continent, its [Russian ally continues to
dominate Europe's energy market]{.underline} and is now just months away
from opening its controversial Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline
beneath the Baltic Sea, guaranteed to increase Moscow's economic
influence. As the massive pipeline project moved to completion last
December, Russian President Putin intensified pressures on NATO with a
roster of "extravagant" demands, including a formal guarantee that
Ukraine not be admitted to the alliance, removal of all the military
infrastructure installed in Eastern Europe since 1997, and a prohibition
against future military activity in Central Asia. In a power play not
seen since Stalin and Mao joined forces in the 1950s, [the alliance
between Putin's raw military force and Xi's relentless economic pressure
may indeed slowly be pulling Europe away from America.]{.underline}
Complicating the US position, Britain's exit from the European Union
cost Washington its most forceful advocate inside Brussels' labyrinthine
corridors of power. And as Brussels and Washington grow apart, Beijing
and Moscow only come closer. Through joint energy ventures, military
maneuvers, and periodic summits, Putin and Xi are reprising the
Stalin-Mao alliance, a strategic partnership at the heart of Eurasia
that could, in the end, break Washington's steel chains that have long
stretched from Eastern Europe to the Pacific. THE SECOND
PILLAR---CENTRAL ASIA [Under its bold BRI scheme to fuse Europe and Asia
into a unitary Eurasian economic bloc, Beijing has crisscrossed Central
Asia with a steel-ribbed cat's cradle of railroads and oil pipelines,
effectively toppling Brzezinski's second pillar of geopolitical
power---that the United States must block the rise of "an assertive
single entity" in the continent's vast "middle space."]{.underline} When
President Xi first announced the Belt and Road Initiative at
Kazakhstan's Nazarbayev University in September 2013, he spoke
expansively about "connecting the Pacific and the Baltic Sea," while
building "the biggest market in the world with unparalleled potential."
In the decade since, Beijing has put in place a bold design for
transcending the vast distances that historically separated Asia and
Europe. Starting in 2008, the China National Petroleum Corporation
collaborated with Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan to launch a
Central Asia-China gas pipeline that will eventually extend more than
4,000 miles. By 2025, in fact, there should be an integrated inland
energy network, including Russia's extensive grid of gas pipelines,
reaching 6,000 miles from the Baltic to the Pacific. [The only real
barrier to China's bid to capture Eurasia's vast "middle space" was the
now-ended US occupation of Afghanistan.]{.underline} To join Central
Asia's gas fields to the energy-hungry markets of South Asia, the TAPI
(Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India) pipeline was announced in
2018, but progress though the critical Afghan sector was slowed by the
war there. In the months before it captured Kabul, however, Taliban
diplomats turned up in Turkmenistan and China to offer assurances about
the project's future. Since then, the scheme has been revived, opening
the way for Chinese investment that could complete its capture of
Central Asia. THE THIRD PILLAR---THE PACIFIC LITTORAL [The most volatile
flashpoint In Beijing's grand strategy for breaking Washington's
geopolitical grip over Eurasia lies in the contested waters between
China's coast and the Pacific littoral,]{.underline} which the Chinese
call "the first island chain." By building a half-dozen island bases of
its own in the South China Sea since 2014, swarming Taiwan and the East
China Sea with repeated fighter plane forays, and staging joint
maneuvers with Russia's navy, Beijing has been conducting a relentless
campaign to begin what Brzezinski called "the expulsion of America from
its offshore bases" along that Pacific littoral. [As China's economy
grows larger and its naval forces do, too, the end of Washington's
decades-long dominion over that vast ocean expanse may be just over the
horizon.]{.underline} For one thing, China may at some point achieve
supremacy in certain critical military technologies, including
super-secure "quantum entanglement" satellite communications and
hypersonic missiles. Last October, the chair of the US Joint Chiefs,
Gen. Mark Milley, called [China's recent launch of a hypersonic missile
"very close" to "a Sputnik moment."]{.underline} While US tests of such
weapons, which can fly faster than 4,000 mph, have repeatedly failed,
China successfully orbited a prototype whose speed and stealth
trajectory suddenly make US aircraft carriers significantly more
difficult to defend. But [China's clear advantage in any struggle over
that first Pacific island chain is simply distance.]{.underline} A
battle fleet of two US supercarriers operating 5,000 miles from Pearl
Harbor could deploy, at best, 150 jet fighters. In any conflict within
200 miles of China's coast, Beijing could use up to 2,200 combat
aircraft as well as DF-21D "carrier-killer" missiles whose 900-mile
range makes them, according to US Navy sources, "a severe threat to the
operations of U.S. and allied navies in the western Pacific." The
tyranny of distance, in other words, means that [the US loss of that
first island chain, along with its axial anchor on Eurasia's Pacific
littoral, should only be a matter of time.]{.underline} In the years to
come, as more such incidents erupt around Eurasia's ring of fire,
readers can insert them into their own geopolitical model---a useful,
even essential, means for understanding a fast-changing world. And as
you do that, just remember that history has never ended, while [the US
position in it is being remade before our eyes.]{.underline}

The Mighty Greenback Ever since Donald Trump entered the White House,
the [global economy has been shuffling into]{.underline} what strategic
thinkers have warned [is increasingly a bipolar world featuring **a
rising China-led club of autocracies against the U.S. and its fellow
declining guardians of liberal democracy.**]{.underline} This is the
week that, thanks to Vladimir Putin and the U.S.-led reaction to his
invasion of Ukraine, the shuffle arguably turned into a sprint towards
that divided world. It's also the week that a [U.S. written off by many
at home and abroad as a dysfunctional aging power reasserted its unique
place in the global economy. **China Is Catching Up in Economic
Weight\...**]{.underline} Share of global GDP (at PPP) History moves
frighteningly fast some times. But when it does so it also usually
shines a light on truths that we've forgotten. And that second point
above --- the one about [American power reasserting itself --- may just
be the forgotten truth to seize on this time.]{.underline} The dominant
strategic narrative about the approaching bipolar world depended a lot
on an ever-rising China being ready to offer an alternative to the U.S.
This week we're learning that it probably isn't and that Xi Jinping has
reasons to be nervous about that. \... But Far Behind in Financial Clout
**[The Chinese currency remains a bit-part player on the global
scene]{.underline}** Source: SWIFT, International Monetary Fund As we
write in today's Bloomberg Big Take here, [China may be catching up when
it comes to economic output]{.underline}, the bit measured by GDP. But
the U.S. still controls the financial architecture that makes the global
economy run, which gives it and its allies the ability to turn off the
switch and quickly isolate even big economies like Russia. Beijing's
efforts over more than a decade to create an alternative have so far
fallen way short of presenting a meaningful alternative to the
dollarized world. The renminbi accounts for just about 3% of global
payments and a mere 2.7% of official foreign-exchange reserves. As
analysts at the Rhodium Group wrote, the China Interbank Payment System
set up as a way around dollar-based payments, so far features just 75
participants, all of which are overseas branches of Chinese banks. That
may change. **[The war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia's
central bank and its foreign reserves brought by the U.S. and Europe may
precipitate a rush out of the dollar and a broad embrace of China's new
systems, as some have warned.]{.underline}** But there\'s an equally
plausible opposing prediction --- that the war and the economic lessons
of the response serve as a reminder of the lack of real alternatives and
cement the dollar\'s place for some time. ---Shawn Donnan Got tips or

Inflation **[Consumer price indexes across major economies are already
on the rise]{.underline}** Source: OECD \* [Supply chains that rattled
the global economy through the pandemic are unleashing another shock as
efforts to choke off trade with Russia strain resources]{.underline}
ranging from fertilizer needed for crops and palladium for car-making,
to oil that's used to produce almost everything. The upshot: **[a world
economy that again faces the prospect of stagflationary
forces]{.underline}** as inflation quickens and growth fades, compelling
central banks to choose which to tackle while fearing the challenge they
don't take on then gets out of hand. The choice is even starker now than
it was during the early days of the pandemic. Back then, monetary policy
makers elected to buoy demand as a recession hit. Now **[inflation is at
multi-decade highs]{.underline}**, forcing them to focus on runaway
prices, although perhaps alert to the risk they may have to move more
slowly than anticipated. "Were this 2022 supply shock a first, central
banks would be more confident of its transitory inflation impact," said
Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. "But
this is an inflation shock compounding pre-existing evidence of sticky
inflation, so adding to concerns that policy will have to treat
attendant higher prices as more than a temporary phenomena, even if
growth slows." Need-to-Know Research What's the difference between 5%
and 5.5%? When it comes to China's growth target for 2022 --- set to be
announced by Premier Li Keqiang the morning of March 5 in Beijing --- it
amounts to a notably different trajectory for policy the rest of the
year. So say JPMorgan Chase & Co. economists led by Zhu Haibin.
Observers' expectations have coalesced around a 5.5% goal and a 5%
bottom line. The lower target would involve "neutral" policy, while the
higher one would require stronger monetary easing, they wrote to clients
this week. Reliable GDP Growth Targets [China's economy has almost never

to minding fiscal deficits and controlling local government debt risks.

**Guyer 3/1** -- foreign policy journalist, 3/1/22. (Jonathan, "The
Ukraine war shows the limits of US power", Vox,
<https://www.vox.com/22951264/russia-ukraine-war-american-superpower-limits>,
accessed 7/7/22)//jd

Russia has violated Ukraine's sovereignty and international law. [The US
response has been economic: sanctions against Russia that are the
largest ever and yet simultaneously unlikely to alter the shape of
Russian President Vladimir Putin's aggression]{.underline}. So, how
should we think about the US as a superpower in 2022? It's too early to
draw broad conclusions about what war in Eastern Europe means for the
future of America in the world. But [there are enough clues to suggest
that America's power has limits, and indeed it always has.]{.underline}
With the Soviet Union's demise, [the United States achieved global
dominance for a brief unipolar moment.]{.underline} Then President
George W. Bush squandered it through destructive (and expensive)
misguided regime-change wars. Subsequent presidents gaslit the American
public on progress in the Middle East in two conflicts that killed
hundreds of thousands. Despite all those unforced errors, t[he United
States remains a superpower, though the limits of non-military power
have been exposed.]{.underline} Thomas Pickering, who served as
ambassador to Russia from 1993 to 1996, says that the "caricature" of
America as a superpower has obscured the way most Americans think about
how the world works. As a career diplomat over four decades, Pickering
witnessed [America's global position change from the Cold War to the
breakup of the Soviet Union to the height of US supremacy at the turn of
the millennium]{.underline}. "If your assumption is that a superpower
can do anything, anywhere, anytime it wishes, without suffering the
consequences of risk and uncertainty, then you misperceived the current
world situation," he told me. [Putin's invasion of Ukraine, explained A
superpower is not infallible and omnipoten]{.underline}t. The United
States will not send in troops but has shipped hundreds of millions of
dollars of weapons to Ukraine, shepherded an international coalition to
institute wide-ranging economic sanctions, and encouraged tech companies
and global organizations like FIFA and the Olympics to pursue the
cultural isolation of Russia. And ye[t the United States, even with the
world's largest military and most robust economy, has not been able to
induce Russia toward a different path]{.underline}. So, Putin continues
to deploy his army toward Kyiv. And **[stopping that incursion does not
appear to be something America has the power to change without risking
nuclear war]{.underline}**. Superpowers need to pick their battles and
engage in the same tough choices as any other country --- especially
when confronted with an adversary with nuclear capability, such as
Russia. And rather than grasping the complexity of world affairs, many
Americans have internalized the shibboleths that the US has never lost a
war and that the US never compromises with enemies, especially during a
conflict. Neither is true[. Both factors show that, as a country, the
United States has failed to recognize its own constraints, some of which
have long existed and are simply accentuated by Russian
aggression]{.underline}. How the unipolar moment ended When the Cold War
ended in the '90s, the United States possessed unrivaled economic and
military power. Scholar Francis Fukuyama claimed the "End of History"
and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asserted the centrality
of American exceptionalism in her coinage, "the indispensable nation."
Some argue that that unipolar moment was overstated. "Look, the
Americans suffered from hubris after the end of the Soviet Union," said
Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor who has written widely about American
power. "The unipolar moment, I think, was always illusory." At the end
of the Cold War, the US did continue to hold itself out as the guarantor
of security. "The United States appointed itself as responsible for
peace, security, and democracy in Europe," Stephen Wertheim, a historian
of US foreign policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
told me. In response to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, the United States,
through NATO, took military action against Serbia. The intervention was
relatively limited, and the outcome of it was a successful projection of
US migh[t. But that unilateral moment, real or imagined, was
short-lived. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, were not what
challenged that global supremacy,]{.underline} argues Wertheim. Rather,
[it was the 20 disastrous years of overreach in America's response. The
invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan exposed the limits of US
power.]{.underline} It could be said that Osama bin Laden understood
something about Americans that they didn't understand about themselves,
namely that in reaction to heinous terror attacks America would
overreact. With the invasion and occupation of two countries, the US
would face two decades of blowback that tore at the country's seams,
that undermined democratic values through the war on terrorism at home
and abroad. "Basically, with the Iraq invasion, we bite off more than we
can chew, and we get a comeuppance," said Nye. [The United States, mired
in the Middle East and Afghanistan, continued to expand its role as
global policeman through a network of US bases and military commitments
that, counterintuitively, detracted from US power.]{.underline} It's at
this time that China began to rise as a counterbalancing force and
Russia reemerged as a power in Europe. "As the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan have obvious problems, we start to enter into a gradual
period of decline in belief that the United States can reshape other
societies," Wertheim explained. "One problem is that this led us to make
commitments to Ukraine. That means that we suffer a loss of prestige
when we don't make good those commitments." President Joe Biden speaks
about the end of the war in Afghanistan from the White House on August
31, 2021. Evan Vucci/AP [Now that the US is caught in a potential
face-off with a nuclear superpower, it is clear that perhaps the biggest
failure of recent years has been the de-emphasis on arms control and the
reduction of nuclear weapons worldwide.]{.underline} President Barack
Obama, who in his early life was a staunch anti-nuclear activist,
negotiated a new START Treaty in 2011, which curbs and monitors the US
and Russia's nuclear warheads. That's now been extended to 2026, but
more is needed. Over decades, Washington and Moscow allowed the arms
control regime to decline, which culminated in President Donald Trump's
withdrawal from the important 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces.
["Slowly, the structures that kept US-Russian military competition
visible and predictable fell away,"]{.underline} said Heather Hurlburt,
of the think tank New America. "At the same time, Beijing" --- itself a
nuclear power --- "is building up its arsenal and making it very clear
that it's not interested in the US-Soviet arms control model." And
o[ther global crises, such as the pandemic, have exposed the inability
of the US to lead as the indispensable nation.]{.underline} The
lesser-discussed dynamics that have undermined US power Now the United
States and Europe are waging an economic war against Russia. Underneath
that, [one can see America's failure to imagine a post-oil economy or a
globally urgent set of policies to address the climate crisis. Even as
sanctions hobble Russia, the international market depends on Russian
energy resources]{.underline} --- [with inevitable knock-on effects that
damage everyone else]{.underline}. The [human rights rhetoric from
American leaders has also deluded Americans]{.underline}. Most US
presidents, with the exception of Trump, have spotlighted abuses
worldwide. But t[hey have not stopped the American way of doing hefty
business with prominent abusers like Russia and China]{.underline}.
Europe also got comfortable with this equation, as Maximilian Popp
writes in Spiegel International[. It's a contradiction that has
empowered authoritarians like Putin]{.underline}. While [the US has
failed to act assertively on the global crises that it cannot avoid ---
climate and pandemic]{.underline}, to name only two --- [the diplomatic
corps have also been hollowed ou]{.underline}t. [Trump can be blamed for
some]{.underline} of this disintegration [but not all of
it.]{.underline} Europe has wondered whether the problem wasn't only
Trump but, at its core, America. This is especially the case after the
chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer. "The Afghanistan thing
got to a deeper worry that they have about American power," said Jeremy
Shapiro of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Though European
leaders may be muted about this issue now, he told me that [there are
concerns about American competence because of polarization in
Washington,]{.underline} "because the Republicans and Democrats are
playing domestic politics with everything." [US democracy and America's
capacity to promote human rights worldwide are connected,]{.underline}
says Suzanne Nossel, the CEO of PEN America. "It's now hit home at a
much deeper level, that those two things are intertwined and that our
democracy is seen as teetering and crumbling at the edges, that we
cannot be an effective force for democracy globally," she told me. A
country that has depended on its standing as an economic force and a
democratic authority worldwide is at its weakest and most dysfunctional
in half a century or more. Hurlburt calls it "self-inflicted decline."
[The combined result is that the US is effectively not showing
up.]{.underline} It's good that Biden has ruled out putting US troops
into Russia's new war in Europe, a potentially endless conflict for a
country that took two decades to leave Afghanistan. That decision lays
bare a reality that American foreign policy circles have too often
ignored. As Hurlburt put it, "Gravity applies to us just like everybody
else."

#### Ukraine marks the limits of America's influence, letting multipowers emerge

**Ashford**, PhD, **7/4**/22(Emma M., is currently a resident senior
fellow with the New American Engagement Initiative in the Scowcroft
Center for Strategy and Security and has a PhD in Foreign Affairs from
the University of Virginia, published 7/4/22, accessed 7/7/22, "Ukraine
and the Return of the Multipolar World",
<https://nationalinterest.org//ukraine-and-return-multipolar-world-203276>)//lexmw

It is therefore easy to see why many have hailed the [war in
Ukraine](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/causes-and-consequences-ukraine-crisis-203182)---and
the unexpected successes of the Ukrainian military in pushing back the
initial Russian onslaught---as a repudiation of spheres of influence in
world affairs, and a reassertion of the notion of an American-led
liberal international order in which power and might matters less than
norms and values. But nothing could be more mistaken. A [sphere of
influence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/04/12/americas-hypocrisy-over-ukraine-spheres-influence/)
is not a normative concept, nor something a state cedes to another out
of courtesy or pity. It is instead a simple fact: the place where one
great power is unwilling or unable to commit the necessary resources to
force another state to submit. In that regard, Ukraine is itself not a
repudiation of the idea of spheres of influence, but rather a clear
example of how they work in practice. [**Ukraine** **is** both **a clear
indicator of the limits of America's** **global** **sphere of
influence** in the post-Cold War period, and a demonstration of the
extent to which Russia is able to defend what it sees as its own
regional sphere. **The war in Ukraine** thus **does not mark a
continuation of the [unipolar
moment](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1990-01-01/unipolar-moment)**,
**but instead**, a dividing line between the period when the United
States saw the whole world as its sphere of influence, and **a new, more
multipolar world in which U.S. power is [constrained and
limited](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/america-world-limits-203217).**]{.underline}
To put it another way: the war in Ukraine has demonstrated three things
about the shifting balance of global power. First[, **while America
may** still **claim a global sphere of influence**, **it is not willing
in practice to risk a [nuclear
war](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/does-nuclear-war-loom-russia-202331)**
**with Russia** to protect Ukraine]{.underline}. American arms,
intelligence, and finance have undoubtedly served to tip the balance in
the conflict, but it will not be fought by American troops. Second,
spheres of influence are rarely uncontested, and Russia has thus far
proven incapable of imposing its will on Ukraine, failing to achieve
both its primary and secondary military goals in this war. As such, the
boundaries of a potential Russian sphere of influence may in practice be
far smaller than assumed prior to February 24. They may be limited to
little more than Russia's own borders. Third[, **while** much of the
coverage of **the war in Ukraine has been framed in this bipolar
way**---presenting the conflict **as a struggle between Russia and the
West**---the **response** to the war **has been** far [less
clear-cut](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-west-is-fully-behind-ukraine-developing-countries-see-a-double-standard-51652998228).
Outside of Europe, most states have taken a more **nuanced** approach to
the crisis.]{.underline} Poorer African and Asian states have joined UN
votes condemning Russia but have not joined sanctions. India has refused
to take sides, a decision rooted in its partial dependence on Russian
military exports, and has benefitted from cut-rate Russian oil exports.
The Gulf States have for the most part carefully cultivated their
neutrality, refusing to increase oil production or even to call the
conflict a war. Meanwhile, Beijing has pursued cautious support of
Moscow but has resisted any deeper political or economic involvement.
[None of this suggests either that we are headed back into the post-Cold
War unipolar moment, or that we are headed for a new Cold War-style
showdown with Russia, or even with both Russia and China.]{.underline}
Instead[**, it suggests** that **the world** **is increasingly
fracturing into a more complex and multipolar environment**, **one in
which America's** long-running foreign policy adventurism and overreach
are liable to leave it **overextended**]{.underline}. For all the
triumphalism of the Washington foreign policy narrative on Ukraine, it
would be foolish for U.S. policymakers to assume that this war presents
either a vindication of the [liberal
order](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/11/us-russia-war-ukraine-democracy-autocracy/)
or a repudiation of power politics and spheres of influence. Instead, it
suggests that they must learn to navigate a world that is not divided
into black and white, but rather, into many shades of gray.

#### Russia challenging the US over Ukraine marks the end of US heg

https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/13/ukraine-war-realism-great-powers-unipolarity/)//lexmw

Whatever the outcome, many observers believe the war will have a
[profound effect on the broader condition of world
politics](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/04/war-ukraine-turning-point-history/).
They see the war in Ukraine as a watershed moment: a giant fork in the
road. If Russia loses big, the "liberal world order" will get a new
lease on life and the forces of autocracy will suffer a setback. If
Putin ekes out some sort of win, however, they foresee a [dark slide
toward the totalitarian
abyss](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-01/francis-fukuyama-liberalism-country).
Existing norms against the acquisition of territory by force will be
eroded, and other autocrats will presumably be empowered to launch
similar campaigns whenever the geopolitical stars align in their favor.
I see it differently. **[The war in Ukraine]{.underline}** is a
significant event, but not because the outcome will have a dramatic
independent effect on the global balance of power or the normative
environment that states have constructed (and sometimes adhere to).
Rather, it is important because it [**signals the end of the** brief
"**unipolar moment**" (1993-2020) **when the U**nited **S**tates **was
the world's** sole genuine **superpower** and because it heralds a
**return to patterns** of world politics **that were temporarily
suppressed during** the short era of **unchallenged U.S.
primacy**.]{.underline} The end of that era was in sight long before
Russia invaded Ukraine, however, and the [war itself is more of a
punctuation mark]{.underline}. (For a similar take, see Stephen Kotkin
[here](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2022-04-06/cold-war-never-ended-russia-ukraine-war).)
I am less inclined to see the war in Ukraine as a transformative moment
because I've heard that song too many times in recent decades. We were
told that "everything had changed" when the Berlin Wall came down, the
Soviet Union imploded, and the Warsaw Pact dissolved. A new world order
was at hand, the "[cynical calculus of pure power politics simply
\[did\] not
compute](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/02/us/the-1992-campaign-excerpts-from-speech-by-clinton-on-us-role.html),"
mankind had supposedly reached the "[end of
history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man),"
and liberal capitalist democracy (preferably the American version) was
now the only game in town. But then "everything changed" again on Sept.
11, 2001, and we were suddenly in a "global war on terror," which some
[overwrought
analysts](https://www.amazon.com/World-War-IV-Struggle-Islamofascism/dp/0307386023)
tried to repackage as "[World War
IV](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1006219259392114120)." But hold on!
"Everything changed" yet again when financial markets collapsed in 2008
and Wall Street's "masters of the universe" were revealed to be
gullible, fallible, and corrupt. And then "everything changed" once more
when Donald Trump became president and began trampling every norm in the
U.S. political playbook. So forgive me if I have trouble seeing the war
in Ukraine as a decisive turning point in the history of humanity. For
all the damage and suffering that have already occurred, it has a long
way to go before it reaches the levels of destruction wrought by the
wars in Indochina, between Iran and Iraq, or in [central
Africa](https://www.amazon.com/Africas-World-War-Continental-Catastrophe/dp/0199754209)---or
by the [U.S. campaigns in Iraq and
Afghanistan](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/summary). The
war could still get there, of course---especially if weapons of mass
destruction are used---but the odds are against it (a prediction that I
fervently hope turns out to be correct). More importantly, what is
different about the current war is that for the first time since the
early 1990s---but hardly the first time in history---there are rival
great powers on the opposite sides of a major war. But this is a
reversion to familiar patterns of great-power conflicts (and proxy wars)
and not something novel or unique. As suggested above, [this war is more
accurately seen as marking the official end of the brief quasi-peace
that followed the end of the Cold War. War didn't disappear in that
period]{.underline}---the United States fought in a bunch of them and
started several---but the conflicts during this period were either civil
wars, wars between minor powers, gross mismatches between major powers
and minor powers, or some combination of all three. [**Direct
great-power competition was muted because neither Russia nor China was
strong enough to openly resist the U**nited **S**tates.]{.underline}
Dartmouth College political scientist William Wohlforth was partly right
when he wrote of the "[stability of a unipolar
world](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539346)": [**Few countries wanted
to** face the "focused enmity" of the United States or **take actions
that might bring** the **U**nited **S**tates into the game in
**opposition**.]{.underline} Where Wohlforth erred was his prediction
that unipolarity might last even longer than Cold War bipolarity. That
misjudgment was not entirely his fault, however, as he could not have
foreseen the repeated blunders that hastened the end of the unipolar
era. U.S. primacy and unipolar stability would have lasted longer if
U.S. policymakers had been smarter, less ideologically driven, and more
realistic (in every sense of that term). [**Instead of preserving U.S.
power**, resolving conflicts wherever possible, and working **to ensure
that no** peer **competitor emerged**, **U.S. officials** mostly **did
the exact opposite**.]{.underline} They [helped China rise more
rapidly](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-10-19/inevitable-rivalry-cold-war)
and squandered trillions of dollars in [costly and misguided crusades in
the greater Middle
East](https://www.amazon.com/Americas-War-Greater-Middle-East-ebook/dp/B0174PRIY4).
[Instead of extending liberal institutions gradually through mechanisms
such as the Partnership for Peace]{.underline}, [**they expanded NATO
with scant regard for Russian concerns** **and** blithely **assumed that
Moscow could or would do nothing to stop it.**]{.underline} Instead of
taking a more measured approach to globalization and making sure its
benefits were widely shared inside the United States, they embraced
neoliberal approaches to global trade and investment and did not do
enough to insulate endangered sectors of the U.S. workforce from
globalization's consequences. And instead of working overtime to make
American democracy a model that other societies might want to emulate,
U.S. politicians---and here I refer primarily to the Republican
Party---repeatedly trampled on the principles and norms that are
essential for true democracy to survive. The unipolar moment was never
going to last forever, but repeated sins of omission and
commission---for which no one was ever held accountable---brought it to
a premature end. So where will this leave us? In the immortal words of
Talking Heads: "[Same as it ever was, same as it ever
was](https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=104)." First, it is a world where
hard power still matters, as everyone has now been reminded. If Russia
succeeds in incorporating the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and a land
bridge to Crimea, it will be because its military forces were able to
accomplish that mission despite their earlier miscalculations and
missteps. If Ukraine retains all or most of its former territory, it
will be because of the hard power its citizens employed (with lots of
outside help) to stop its larger neighbor. If the much ballyhooed "norm
against conquest" gets reinforced, it will not be because Putin suddenly
remembered that norms ought to be followed but because the combination
of Ukrainian nationalism and effective weaponry proved too much for
Moscow to overcome.

### 2NC\-\--UQ\-\--US Decline

#### Hegemony is declining, multilateralism is on the rise 

**Kupchan 21** (Charles Kupchan, professor of international affairs at
Georgetown University, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations, 1/15/2021, "The Case for a Middle Path in U.S. Foreign
Policy", *Foreign Policy,* accessed 6/26/2022,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/01/15/judicious-retrenchment-isolationism-internationalism/)//sfs

Making matters more complicated is the fact that [the [United States is
**no longer a champion** of]{.mark} open [markets]{.mark} and
treaty-based multilateralism. [Amid job loss]{.mark} and stagnant wages,
[protectionism is in vogue]{.mark} on both sides of the aisle. In the
meantime, most Republicans have lost their appetite for international
partnership; Trump speaks for much of his party when he proclaims that
"we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false
song of globalism. ... We will never enter America into any agreement
that reduces our ability to control our own affairs." Democrats remain
far more receptive to teamwork with other nations, but getting most
treaties through the Senate may be out of reach for the foreseeable
future.]{.underline}

Nonetheless[, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [**cannot afford** to
return to]{.mark} the stiff-necked [unilateralism]{.mark} that guided
its statecraft from the founding era until World War II. Broad
[international coop]{.mark}eration [will be]{.mark} [needed]{.mark} to
address urgent challenges]{.underline}, including managing a globalized
and interdependent economy, arresting climate change, shutting down
terrorist networks, countering nuclear proliferation, promoting
cybersecurity, and advancing public health. The United States will not
be able to accomplish these goals without the help of like-minded
partners.

[[With the globalization of the liberal order **out of reach**]{.mark},
a strategy of judicious retrenchment will entail a new emphasis on
informal pacts. Contact groups, coalitions of the willing, and voluntary
covenants will supersede alliances and standing institutions as the
vehicles of choice for joint initiatives.]{.underline} Even as it seeks
to refurbish its own democracy and revive camaraderie and cooperation
among its democratic allies[, [Washington will need to look to a concert
of major powers]{.mark}]{.underline}---a steering group inclusive of
democracies and non-democracies alike---to flesh out new rules of the
road, update norms and practices, and adapt existing institutions to new
global realities.

Forging consensus across international as well as domestic divides is a
must if a rules-based order is to survive the arrival of a world that is
both multipolar and ideologically diverse. A strategy of retrenchment
that acknowledges the need for liberal democracies to work comfortably
with their illiberal counterparts constitutes a setback for the West,
but it is time for the United States to strive for the workable and
attainable, not the impossible.

The third principle of judicious retrenchment entails reestablishing the
United States as the exceptional, but not indispensable, nation. Since
1941, the country's exceptionalist calling has set it on a crusade to
re-create the world in its own image. That approach was a clear
departure from what came before. From 1789 until Pearl Harbor, the
United States generally shunned foreign ambition in order to protect its
unique experiment in political and economic liberty from a tainted
world. Americans aspired to change the world from early on, but they
were long content to do so only by example, by serving as a "city upon a
hill." When their elected leaders tried more activist approaches, such
as the Spanish-American War and World War I, they did not much like the
loss of blood and treasure that resulted---one of the main reasons for
the isolationist retreat of the interwar era.

[The exceptionalist narrative has for way too long been an excuse for
doing too much abroad. Given the dilapidated state of the American
experiment, the renewal of the nation's unique calling must start at
home.]{.underline}

Americans are once again disillusioned with the results of their
exertions abroad, necessitating that liberal internationalists give
considerable ground to the restraint school when it comes to democracy
promotion. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [needs to change back
from]{.mark} democratic [crusader to]{.mark} prudent [exemplar]{.mark}
if it is to cease its misguided efforts to topple unsavory regimes,
avoid strategic overreach, and work with the world as it actually
is.]{.underline} Reclaiming the nation's original conception of
exceptionalism also requires putting America's own house in order. [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [cannot serve as a model when its
political landscape is]{.mark} so deeply [polarized and its
institutions]{.mark} so [dysfunctional.]{.mark} The first priority is to
tackle the **root causes** of the nation's political ills, including
[the pandemic, inequality, racial injustice,]{.mark} and the profound
sense of [economic insecurity]{.mark} that pervades much of the
electorate.]{.underline} The country also needs a credible and effective
immigration policy to help ensure that its exceptionalist narrative
rejects nativism in favor of racial and ethnic pluralism.

Exceptionalism is inseparable from the American creed. And with
illiberalism and intolerance on the march globally, the world urgently
needs an anchor of republican and pluralist ideals---a role that only
the United States has the power and credentials to fulfill. But the
exceptionalist narrative has for way too long been an excuse for doing
too much abroad. Given the dilapidated state of the American experiment,
the renewal of the nation's unique calling must start at home.

Judicious [[retrenchment offers]{.mark} restrainers and liberal
internationalists alike [a **middle ground**]{.mark}. So, too, would it
offer the Democrats and Republicans [opportunities to]{.mark} cease
their partisan sniping and [get behind a common foreign
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Public opinion polls reveal the
electorate's decided weariness with U.S. wars in the Middle East, its
interest in downsizing foreign entanglements, and its desire for
increased focus on the ailing economy at home. It is no accident that
U.S. President Barack Obama, during his reelection campaign, insisted
that it was time for "nation building here at home." In similar fashion,
Trump readied for the 2020 election by downsizing the U.S. military
presence in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan---and continued the drawdown,
including in Somalia, even after losing the election.

Most Democrats and Republicans also agree on the need to maintain U.S.
commitments in Europe and Asia. NATO, for example, enjoys strong support
on both sides of the aisle. Indeed, Congress responded to Trump's
repeated attacks on the alliance by inviting NATO Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg to address a joint session for the first time in history.
Support for containing China is similarly broad. A strategy of pulling
back from the periphery while standing firm in the core would get
bipartisan traction.

To be sure, Democrats and Republicans will continue to come at
foreign-policy issues from different perspectives, but there are points
of overlap. Left-wing progressives opposed to high defense spending are
already joining forces with right-wing libertarians opposed to foreign
entanglements. Democrats who back multilateralism in principle can ally
with Republicans who, in an era of economic duress, are looking to
alliances and other international pacts as vehicles for sharing global
burdens. Social progressives on the left and evangelicals on the right
agree that the United States needs to refurbish its exceptionalist
calling and reclaim its moral authority. Bipartisan support for
retrenchment will need to be cobbled together, in other words, but it is
within reach.

Observing the bitter arguments between President Franklin D. Roosevelt
and America First isolationists over the role that the nation should
play in World War II, the writer Walter Lippmann worried about the
prospect of an America that was so divided that it would be unable to
pursue a coherent foreign policy. "The spectacle of this great nation
which does not know its own mind is as humiliating as it is dangerous,"
Lippmann wrote, warning that "the nation must maintain its objectives
and its power in equilibrium, its purposes within its means and its
means equal to its purposes."

Lippmann was premature but prescient. During World War II and the Cold
War, partisan politics generally stopped at the water's edge. But today,
U.S. grand strategy swings wildly with every power change in Washington,
and the nation's objectives are dangerously out of kilter with its
means. What's required is a paced, measured retrenchment that puts
strategic commitments and political will back into alignment. Judicious
retrenchment is good policy, good politics, and the pathway toward the
middle ground between doing too much and doing too little.

#### **The "American century" has reached its end \-- waning trust with allies and continuous conflict prove**

**Borger 21** \[Borger, Julian, Julian Borger is the Guardian\'s world
affairs editor. He was previously a correspondent in the US, the Middle
East, eastern Europe and the Balkans., "After the chaos in Kabul, is the
American century over?", The Guardian,

A few months ago [there were US bases all over Afghanistan]{.underline}
where you could immerse yourself in Americana, buy Coke and Snickers
bars from vending machines and watch live sport on TV. [Now the outpost
has shrunk to one side of Kabul airport]{.underline}, a chaotic remnant
of a 20-year stay where rearguard troops are trying to salvage the last
scraps of dignity and honour, seemingly tossed aside by the political
leadership in Washington, by trying to extract American stragglers and
Afghan allies. [**Those allies, once inspired by talk of democracy,
women's rights and the free press, are now faced with the awful
life-and-death dilemmas of preserving evidence of their work for or with
the US-led coalition, in the hope of last-minute salvation, or
destroying it, in a bid to escape execution.** The speed and totality of
the defeat at the end of the longest war in US history inevitably raises
questions about its place in the broader sweep of modern
history]{.underline}, and [the biggest question perhaps is whether these
scenes mark the last throes of the "American century".]{.underline} It
has been an era in which [the US was supposed to act as the world's
policeman]{.underline}, maintaining order according to a fixed set of
rules, and stepping in when necessary to stop the worst crimes against
humanity. **[The reality often turned out to be far short of that
ideal]{.underline}**, but is the whole project, in theory and practice,
now coming to an end? The term "American century" was coined in 1941 in
an essay by the publishing tycoon Henry Luce, who suggested that: "We
can make a truly American internationalism something as natural to us in
our time as the airplane or the radio." That ambition was certainly
achieved in the years that followed. The liberation of Europe from the
Nazis was followed by astoundingly successful exercises in
nation-building in West Germany and Japan, which became prosperous
democracies and reliable allies. The D-day landings in 1944 cemented
America's commitment to global intervention. There are other populations
around the world who have reason to see the US global policeman as
essentially a good cop, such as the Bosnians and Kosovans, for whom
America stepped in when European powers failed to lead. "It certainly
wasn't the Cuban missile crisis, it certainly wasn't Iraq, but \[the
Bosnian intervention\] is a good showcase of what can be done when
America has a moderate, benign, ambition," said Sabina Ćudić, of the
Bosnian liberal reformist party Naša Stranka. It was in the aftermath of
the US-led intervention in Bosnia and the subsequent Dayton peace
accords that the US secretary of state Madeleine Albright said: "If we
have to use force, it is because we are America; we are the
indispensable nation." Few if any US officials talk like that now, and
[the last Americans left in Afghanistan feel very dispensable
indeed.]{.underline} In other parts of the world, the experience of
American global policing has been quite different. It was there to allow
the oil to flow and the tankers to sail unimpeded, enforcing a set of
rules, albeit **[rules]{.underline}** that **[were designed at the
outset to benefit the US and the handful of great powers.]{.underline}**
In Latin America, the veneer was even thinner, and [the policeman acted
like the private security firm for a few corporate
interests.]{.underline} [The American century reached its zenith after
the fall of the Berlin wall]{.underline}, and the emergence of the US as
the world's sole, unrivalled superpower. The Soviet Union dissolved in
1991, a neat half-century after Luce published his essay. [The
apotheosis would last a decade]{.underline}, until disaster arrived out
of a clear blue sky on 11 September, 2001. Nearly 3,000 were killed in
the attacks on New York and Washington, but it was America's visceral
reaction that would prove to be more damaging to US standing in the
world. The fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 marked the high point of US

[which will continue to be the reality for the civilian populations left
behind for years, perhaps decades, to come. **Disaster followed
disaster**]{.underline}: the Arab spring was a grotesque inversion of
the European democratic revolution it was supposed to emulate, leaving
bloody chaos both where the old regimes fell, such as Libya, and where
they held firm -- Syria. The damage done by 9/11 did not unfold quite as
terrorist leader Osama bin Laden intended, according to Nelly Lahoud, an
analyst at the thinktank New America who has been sifting through his
papers, but it did have a "catastrophic success" in changing the world.
It was a case of the autoimmune response proving far more deadly than
the infection it was supposed to fight. In a new book, Reign of Terror:
How the 9/11 Era Destabilized America and Produced Trump, former
Guardian journalist Spencer Ackerman argues that the worst damage was
self-inflicted, through the impact of the "global war on terror" and all
its excesses: torture, mass surveillance, militarism and
authoritarianism. ["Of all the endless costs of terrorism, the most
important is the least tallied: what fighting it has cost our
democracy," Ackerman writes. "How like America it is not to recognise
that the true threat was counterterrorism, nor terrorism."]{.underline}
The backlash produced a repugnance in US public opinion for foreign
intervention. One of the few things that Donald Trump and Joe Biden had
in common was their determination to leave Afghanistan, and Biden
completed the withdrawal that Trump agreed with the Taliban in February
2020 in Doha. The 9/11 attacks provoked retaliatory action that even
Osama bin Laden could not have anticipated. The 9/11 attacks provoked

and incompetence which had clearly spread through
administrations.**]{.underline} At the president's prompting, officials
were adamant that the events unfolding at Kabul airport were not a
repeat of the evacuation of Saigon in 1975, photos of which had been an
emblem of American defeat for more than a generation. But the
similarities were unavoidable. "Having literally been in Saigon for the
fall of Saigon, it certainly looks like Saigon to me," said Viet Thanh
Nguyen, a Pulitzer-prize winning author whose family fled Vietnam when
he was four, in a tweet. The US evacuated 130,000 Vietnamese allies in
1975 and subsequently accepted hundreds of thousands of refugees from
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. It was a test of humanity, but also power.
**[A superpower that cannot or will not protect its allies is not worthy
of the name.]{.underline}** In a New York Times commentary Nguyen urged
the Biden administration to do as much for the Afghans. "For these
civilians, the war hasn't ended, and won't end for many years. Their
future -- and Mr Biden's role in determining whether it's one of
resettlement and new beginnings or one of fear and misery -- is what
will determine whether America can still claim it will always stand by
its allies," he wrote. The withdrawal of US troops in 1973, and the fall
of Saigon two years later, seemed at the time as serious a debacle as
Kabul feels now. But it was by no means the end for America's preeminent
role in the world. Mobs scale the wall of the US embassy in Saigon, just
before the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Mobs scale the wall of the US

cold war -- supporting freedom and resisting Soviet communism --
succeeded, even in the face of Washington's blunders in Vietnam and
elsewhere," said Daniel Fried, a former senior state department official
now at the Atlantic Council thinktank. [The US remains, by most
measures, the world's biggest economy, with a far stronger network of
alliances than its rival, China.]{.underline} Josef Joffe, the veteran
editor of Die Zeit now an international affairs professor at Johns
Hopkins University, said the Kabul fiasco "certainly damages three
critical assets of a great power: reliability, credibility and alliance
cohesion." **["Nations will now think twice about committing to the US,
hedging their bets by edging toward China and Russia,"]{.underline}**
Joffe said. "Decline, however, this is not. [Great powers falter when
their material assets wane]{.underline} -- as in the case of Britain in
the 20th century. By contrast, the US remains the greatest economic
power, backed up by technological advantage and the world's most
sophisticated army that can intervene anywhere on the planet, not to
speak of the vast cultural clout China and Russia do not have." Even
after Afghanistan, the US military reach around the globe will still be
fearsome, with almost 800 bases in more than 70 countries. ["The US is
the most hyper-interventionist great power in modern
history]{.underline}, so that even when the American pendulum sort of
swings more toward non-interventionism, the US is still globally
involved," said Dominic Tierney, political science professor at
Swarthmore College and the author of The Right Way to Lose a War:
America in an Age of Unwinnable Conflicts. Tierney noted that the US war
was not even necessarily over in Afghanistan. The administration has
said it will continue to carry out air strikes from afar in the name of
counterterrorism. Furthermore, the reduction in the military footprint
in Afghanistan and the Middle East is intended to free resources for
sharper competition with China. **[Donald Trump's chaotic term as
president unbalanced US geopolitical relationships around the
world.]{.underline}** "A retrenchment from the greater Middle East in
the service of focusing on greater rivals is something that might well
shore up US global hegemony, not weaken it. And I would think that is
what most of the Biden administration thinks that they are doing," said
Stephen Wertheim, a historian and fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, who examined the origins of the American century in
his book, Tomorrow, the World: The Birth of US Global Supremacy.
Wertheim argued however that the character of [US military
interventionism could change in the wake of the defeat in
Afghanistan.]{.underline} "It's hard to imagine that the idea of
nation-building by force will survive the war in Afghanistan," he said,
expressing hope that humanitarian impulses would be channelled through
non-military means. "That, to me, is a much more productive form of
humanitarianism than the fraught project of trying to kill some people
in order to save other people." Few Bosnian Muslims, however, believe
more humanitarian supplies would have prevented more Srebrenica-scale
massacres in 1995. Ćudić, now a member of the federation parliament in
Sarajevo, said: "With all the deserved criticism and analysis of the
American foreign policy of the past decades, we will live to regret the
decline of American ambition." The concern in Sarajevo is that [Russia
and China are filling the space vacated by the US,]{.underline} but
without the same interest in preventing the ultimate partition of Bosnia
on ethnic lines. It is a pattern being witnessed around the world. ["One
of the great dangers for analysis that seeks to be critical of
imperialism is the assumption that only the west, indeed only the USA,
has imperial ambitions and scope. This is fatal,"]{.underline} said
Priyamvada Gopal, professor of postcolonial studies at Cambridge
University. **["By the end of this century, if the world makes it there,
the centre of imperial power will have shifted entirely.]{.underline}**
"What is important is that [the centre of gravity of capitalism is
shifting southwards, and players from Russia and China to India are
emerging."]{.underline}

#### Heg is declining ☹

**Larison 20** (Daniel Larison, published author and columnist, PhD in
history from UChicago, 4/23/2020, "Please Tell The Establishment That
U.S. Hegemony Is Over", *The American Conservative,* accessed 6/26/2022,
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/somebody-tell-the-establishment-that-american-hegemony-is-over/)//sfs

More than 10 years ago, the columnist Charles Krauthammer asserted that
American "decline is a choice," and argued tendentiously that Barack
Obama had chosen it. Yet looking back over the last decade, it has
become increasingly obvious that this decline has occurred irrespective
of what political leaders in Washington want.

The truth is that decline was never a choice, but the U.S. can decide
how it can respond to it. We can continue chasing after the vanished,
empty glory of the "unipolar moment" with bromides of American
exceptionalism. We can continue to delude ourselves into thinking that
military might can make up for all our other weaknesses. Or we can
choose to adapt to a changed world by prudently husbanding our resources
and putting them to uses more productive than policing the world.

There was a brief period [during the 1990s and early 2000s]{.underline}
when [the [U.S.]{.mark} could claim to be the world's [heg]{.mark}emonic
power.]{.underline} America had no near-peer rivals; it was at the
height of its influence across most of the globe[. That status, however,
[was always]{.mark} a **[transitory]{.mark}** one, [and was lost quickly
thanks to]{.mark} self-inflicted [wounds in Iraq and the]{.mark} natural
[growth of other powers that began to compete]{.mark} for influence.
While [America remains]{.mark} the most [powerful]{.mark} state in the
world, [it no longer dominates]{.mark} as it did 20 years ago. [And
there can be **no recapturing** what was lost.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Alexander Cooley and Dan Nexon explore these matters in their new book,
Exit From Hegemony: The Unraveling of the American Global Order. They
make a strong case for distinguishing between the old hegemonic order
and the larger international order of which it is a part. As they put
it, "global [international order is not synonymous with American
hegemony."]{.underline} They also make careful distinctions between the
different components of what is often simply called the "liberal
international order": political liberalism, economic liberalism, and
liberal intergovernmentalism. The first involves the protection of
rights, the second open economic exchange, and the third the form of
international order that recognizes legally equal sovereign states.
Cooley and Nexon note that both critics and defenders of the "liberal
international order" tend to assume that all three come as a "package
deal," but point out that [these parts do not necessarily reinforce each
other and do not have to coexist.]{.underline}

While the authors are quite critical of Trump's foreign policy, they
don't pin the decline of the old order solely on him. They argue that
hegemonic unraveling takes place when the hegemon loses its monopoly
over patronage and "more states can compete when it comes to providing
economic, security, diplomatic, and other goods." [The [U.S. has been
losing ground for]{.mark} the better part of [the last 20 years]{.mark},
much of it unavoidable as [other states grew wealthier]{.mark} [and
sought]{.mark} to wield greater [influence]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
authors make a persuasive case that the "exit" from hegemony is already
taking place and has been for some time.

Many [defenders of U.S. hegemony insist that the "liberal international
order" depends on it]{.underline}. That has never made much sense. For
one, [the continued [maintenance of American hegemony]{.mark} frequently
[conflicts with the rules of international order.]{.mark} The
[hegemon]{.mark} reserves the right to interfere anywhere it wants, and
[tramples on the]{.mark} sovereignty and legal [rights of other
states]{.mark} as it sees fit. In practice, the [U.S. has]{.mark}
frequently [acted]{.mark} as more of a [rogue in its efforts to
"enforce" order]{.mark} than many of the states it likes to
condemn.]{.underline} The most vocal defenders of U.S. hegemony are
unsurprisingly some of the biggest opponents of international law---at
least when it gets in their way. Cooley and Nexon make a very important
observation related to this in their discussion of the role of
revisionist powers in the world today:

But the key point is that we need to be extremely careful that we don't
conflate "revisionism" with opposition to the United States. The desire
to undermine hegemony and replace it with a multipolar system entails
revisionism with respect to the distribution of power, but it may or may
not be revisionist with respect to various elements of international
architecture or infrastructure.

The core of the book is a survey of three different sources for the
unraveling of U.S. hegemony: major powers, weaker states, and
transnational "counter-order" movements. Cooley and Nexon trace how
Russia and China have become increasingly effective at wielding
influence over many smaller states through patronage and the creation of
parallel institutions and projects such as the Collective Security
Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO),
and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). They discuss a number of weaker
states that have begun hedging their bets by seeking patronage from
these major powers as well as the U.S. Where once America had a "near
monopoly" on such patronage, this has ceased to be the case. They also
track the role of "counter-order" movements, especially nationalist and
populist groups, in bringing pressure to bear on their national
governments and cooperating across borders to challenge international
institutions. Finally, they spell out how the U.S. itself has
contributed to the erosion of its own position through reckless policies
dating back at least to the invasion of Iraq.

The conventional response to the unraveling of America's hegemony here
at home has been either a retreat into nostalgia with simplistic paeans
to the wonders of the "liberal international order" that ignore the
failures of that earlier era or an intensified commitment to hard-power
dominance in the form of ever-increasing military budgets (or some
combination of the two). Cooley and Nexon contend that the
[[Trump]{.mark} administration]{.underline} has opted for the second of
these responses. Citing the president's emphasis on maintaining military
dominance and his support for exorbitant military spending, they say "it
[suggests an [approach to heg]{.mark}emony more dependent upon military
instruments, and thus on the ability (and willingness) of the United
States to continue extremely high defense spending. It [depends on the
wager that the United States]{.mark} both [can and should
substitute]{.mark} raw [military power for its hegemonic
infrastructure.]{.mark}" [That]{.mark} not only [points to]{.mark} what
Barry Posen has called "[illiberal hegemony]{.mark}," but [also leads
to]{.mark} a [foreign policy that is]{.mark} even more **[militarized
and unchecked]{.mark}** by international law.]{.underline}

Cooley and Nexon make a compelling observation about how Trump's demand
for more allied military spending differs from normal calls for
burden-sharing. Normally, burden-sharing advocates call on allies to
spend more so the U.S. can spend less. But that isn't Trump's position
at all. His administration pressures allied governments to increase
their spending, while showing no desire to curtail the Pentagon budget:

Retrenchment entails some combination of shedding international security
commitments and shifting defense burdens onto allies and partners. This
allows the retrenching power, in principle, to redirect military
spending toward domestic priorities, particularly those critical to
long-term productivity and economic growth. In the current American
context, this means making long-overdue investments in transportation
infrastructure, increasing educational spending to develop human
capital, and ramping up support for research and development. This
rationale makes substantially less sense if retrenchment policies do not
produce reductions in defense spending--which is why Trump's aggressive,
public, and coercive push for burden sharing seems odd. Recall that
Trump and his supporters want, and have already implemented, increases
in the military budget. There is no indication that the Trump
administration would change defense spending if, for example, Germany or
South Korea increased their own military spending or more heavily
subsidized American bases.

The coronavirus pandemic has exposed how misguided our priorities as a
nation have been. There is now a chance to change course, but that will
require our leaders to shift their thinking. [[U.S. hegemony is
**already on its way out**;]{.mark} now Americans need to decide what
our role in the world will look like afterwards. Warmed-over platitudes
about "leadership" won't suffice and throwing more money at the Pentagon
is a dead end. [The way forward is]{.mark} a strategy of
[retrenchment]{.mark}, restraint, and renewal.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--UQ[\-\--Retrenchment]{.underline}

#### Retrenchment is gradual now -- perception and consistency are key.   

**Shapiro 22**, director of research at the European Council on Foreign
Relations, nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
05-27-2022 (Jeremy, \"Getting to Restraint, Responsibly,\" World
Politics Review,

kav) 

[The right question is not whether reducing America's global commitments
should take place, but how it can be accomplished in the most
responsible manner.]{.underline} 

[This fear often expresses itself as an appeal to American
exceptionalism and its unique role in upholding world order. For many
foreign policy thinkers in the United States, the long arm of U.S.
global hegemony has become necessary for maintaining stability in the
world and even democracy at home.]{.underline} "The only hope for
preserving liberalism at home and abroad," Robert Kagan informs us, "is
the maintenance of a world order conducive to liberalism, and the only
power capable of upholding such an order is the United States." 

[A world without U.S. leadership, according to these commentators, is
therefore one that is nasty, brutish and usually dominated by
China.]{.underline} For the sake of all that is holy and democratic, the
United States must therefore maintain its policy of global leadership
and alliance commitments around the world, even if it means horning its
way into disputes in the South Caucasus that are otherwise irrelevant to
U.S. interests. 

Among the Washington foreign policy cognoscenti, this vision of
America's role in the world is something of an article of faith. An
appeal for less U.S. geopolitical involvement in the world, such as the
one I published in April 2021 in Foreign Affairs, immediately elicits
questions about whether, in the absence of the United States, stability
will persist. 

[This special U.S. role in maintaining peace and democracy in far-flung
regions would no doubt come as a surprise to the residents of many
countries that have found themselves on the wrong end of U.S.
precision-guided weapons or CIA-sponsored coups. A 2021 poll of 53
countries by the Alliance of Democracies found that globally, 44 percent
of respondents believe that U.S. influence threatens democracy in their
country, compared to 28 percent for the influence of Russia and 38
percent for that of China.]{.underline} 

But it is true that the United States is a massive presence in
international politics in almost every region of the world and that
global politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. [Any major change in U.S.
policies in volatile regions will create reactions from both U.S. allies
and adversaries]{.underline} that will be at best unsettling for those
invested in the status quo, and at worst destabilizing. 

The net effect of those changes is much more difficult to predict. One
can engage in fascinating counterfactual speculations on whether, for
example, a U.S. military withdrawal from Europe will stimulate
destabilizing Russian expansionism or inspire more effective European
defense efforts. The Nagorno-Karabakh outcome suggests that the U.S.
role in maintaining regional stability is often exaggerated or even
romanticized by American observers. But the sheer alarm of U.S. allies
at the prospect of U.S. withdrawal implies that if it is carried out too
suddenly, it could inspire all sorts of overreactions. In the end, we
cannot know. 

Regardless of the effect, however, power shifts and polarized domestic
politics have made retrenchment a geopolitical necessity. As Biden's
focus on China implies, the U.S. will want to concentrate its
geopolitical efforts in the near future on East Asia, where the rise of
China presents a direct threat to the United States that the public
seems to accept. Unfortunately, [Biden's tendency to describe that
effort as a global, ideological war against authoritarianism,
reminiscent of the Cold War, encourages the U.S. to diffuse its efforts
all around the world. This tendency to define the war in ideological
terms and exaggerate the importance of peripheral theaters was arguably
the central strategic mistake of the Cold War and led the U.S. to
disasters in Vietnam and Central America. In the geopolitical contest
with China, the United States simply cannot afford that diffusion of
effort.]{.underline} 

If [retrenchment is a political and strategic necessity domestically,
then it must happen despite the risks to stability]{.underline}. The
right question, therefore, is not whether reducing America's global
commitments should take place, but how it can be accomplished in the
most responsible manner. Specific political contexts will of course
matter, but here are a few principles for responsible U.S.
retrenchment. 

[The U.S. must be clear and declaratory in its intentions, with as
long-term a planning horizon in each region as possible. To date, the
U.S. is about as opaque and inconsistent as possible on this point,
perplexing interested observers at home and abroad.]{.underline} One can
understand their confusion. 

[The Biden administration, for instance, sometimes implies that it
intends to reduce commitments]{.underline} in the Middle East and even
Europe, and has given life to the idea of retrenchment by announcing a
withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. But at the same time, it has
made clear that the United States intends to remain and even increase
its geopolitical presence in East Asia, [even as Biden promotes the idea
of a new global competition against authoritarianism and repeats the
mantras of U.S. global leadership as if nothing fundamental is
changing.]{.underline} 

[If Biden does want to reduce U.S. commitments, he should describe
clearly what that means in the major regions of the world and for U.S.
leadership globally.]{.underline} 

This implies that Washington's will toward leadership continues
unabated, reflecting in part a difficult domestic political dynamic by
which any effort to rationalize the U.S. approach to the world,
particularly by a Democratic president, is met with charges of weakness
and appeasement. Thus, even though the Trump administration also pursued
a policy whose ultimate goal was withdrawal from Afghanistan, Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell saw a political advantage in labeling
Biden's plan "a grave mistake." 

But Afghanistan, like most foreign policy issues, is a low priority for
the voting public. If the Biden administration articulated a principled
strategy of responsible retrenchment more broadly, it would certainly
occasion howls from various think tanks in Washington and partisan
attacks from Republican hawks in Congress, but it would have little
impact on the administration's domestic political standing. If the
administration indeed does want to reduce U.S. commitments and pursue,
as Biden often claims, a foreign policy for the middle class, it should
be willing to describe clearly what that means in the major regions of
the world and for U.S. leadership globally. 

That could mean many things, but if Biden does intend to follow through
on his pivot to Asia, he should articulate a clear and certain timeline
for allies in Europe and the Middle East for when the U.S. intends to
withdraw forces and military protection in those theaters. 

[U.S. withdrawal from any of its overseas commitments should be gradual
and evolutionary, rather than revolutionary.]{.underline} [This is
related to the first principle, in that the United States can enhance
stability in the wake of its departure if, rather than announcing it
just months before it leaves, Washington articulates a glide path for a
progressive drawdown over the course of several years. The task of
removing U.S. troops from Europe or the Persian Gulf, for example, can
and should proceed at a measured pace, albeit with interim
benchmarks.]{.underline} In the end, it is closer to the work of a
decade than of a presidential term. [Such a pace will allow U.S. allies
and partners, as well as their adversaries, to adjust slowly as well,
enhancing their ability to find a new normal and maintain stability in
those regions.]{.underline} 

The U.S. should consciously and proactively promote adjustment
mechanisms for partners and allies. Even as U.S. domestic politics has
become suffused with demands for withdrawal, U.S. foreign policy---and
the foreign policy establishment---continues to show ambivalence toward
efforts by [U.S. allies to take greater responsibility for their own
security affairs. This is clearest in Europe, where movement toward
European strategic sovereignty often elicits worries from U.S.
commentators about "decoupling" and even occasionally rebukes from the
U.S. government over the issue of defense procurement.]{.underline}

true structural power in global finance", Cambridge University Press,

The nine segments discussed in this article allow for a truly
comprehensive analysis of Anglo-America's structural power in global
finance roughly from 2000 until 2014. There is no space in this article
to attribute different weights to the nine segments (if that is indeed
possible) -- however, it is clear that [financial wealth is by far the
largest segment.]{.underline} All nine segments together constitute
contemporary global finance -- the financial structure in which other
states and foreign corporations have to operate. Table 1 provides an
overview of the different segments, specifying the latest share of
Anglo-America (also split up into the share of the US and that of the
other Anglo-American jurisdictions) as well as the trajectory observed
in the period for which data have been available. [The market shares in
the different segments have to be seen against the backdrop that
**Anglo-America represents about 31 per cent of global
GDP.**]{.underline} In all segments, except inward direct investment,
Anglo-America has a much higher share than this 31 per cent.
[Anglo-American dominance has been particularly strong (and increasing)
in the first two segments of OTC trading.]{.underline} Here, NY-LON has
a very dominant position. The third segment is about foreign exchange
reserves. Here, the US dollar clearly dominates globally (being also the
leading international payments currency). [The US is the dominant
country in terms of the market capitalisation of domestic publicly
listed corporations]{.underline}, the subject of segment four. America
accounts for about 22 per cent of global GDP, yet its corporations are
responsible for 41 per cent of total global market capitalisation. Thus,
[US corporations are in a very powerful position globally]{.underline},
as also found by Starrs.Footnote 92 **[Anglo-America as a whole even
accounts for 53 per cent of global market capitalisation.]{.underline}**
Table 1 Anglo-America's dominance in nine key domains of global finance
(latest year, in percentages). Source: Author. This dominant position is
similar in segment five, external bank deposits. Again, the UK plays an
important role here, helping to increase Anglo-America's share in recent
years. Segments six, seven, and eight have to be seen together. Segment
six, inward direct investment, is the only one in which Anglo-America
(28 per cent) has a global share below 43 per cent. However, this should
not be interpreted as a weakness, because it is a manifestation of what
Schwartz has called 'global financial arbitrage';Footnote 93 the US (and
Anglo-America in general) invests more in high-yielding outward direct
investment, whereas non-Anglophone investors mostly hold lower yielding
portfolio investment (including US treasuries) and significantly less
inward direct investment into (Anglo-)America. The four novel
visualisations presented in this article show very clearly that [the
US-UK axis is the fulcrum of private global finance and that
Anglo-America as a whole has a very dominant position in cross-border
finance.]{.underline} The vast majority of non-Anglophone countries
shown in the different visualisations is profoundly integrated into
Anglo-American structures of global finance, making it extremely
difficult for them to decouple. Finally, the analysis of global
financial wealth -- a good proxy for financial power -- is very
instructive. Contrary to conventional wisdom, [Anglo-America's share in
financial wealth has increased since the financial crisis and remained
stable since the early 2000s. If we assume that hegemony in
international political economy is cyclical,]{.underline} as many
world-system analysis scholars seem to suggest, than it would be logical
to conclude that **[the US is on a trajectory of perpetual decline
vis-à-vis the rising powers]{.underline}**, such as China. Analysing the
power position of the US in isolation misses the big picture, however.
America has a 'family', so to speak, which is the group of the
Anglophone countries. The Anglo-American countries and territories have
deep common roots that manifest themselves in similar socioeconomic
systems, likewise legal systems based on common law, and comparable
overseas investment patterns. Moreover, the Anglosphere has its own
corporate community via board interlocks as well as a distinct
cross-border direct investment network.Footnote 94 Finally, the
unparalleled global intelligence cooperation of the Anglophone countries
is the most obvious indication that we should analyse Anglo-America
together and not classify the individual jurisdictions solely on
geographical grounds. Van der Pijl calls this formation the Lockean
heartland of the global political economy, in which Anglo-American
'civil society' (primarily the business and financial elites) operates
transnationally. That is arguably why Anglo-America is strongly
integrated by private financial holdings. The very nature of the Lockean
state/society complex implies that Anglo-America is not a formally
organised and politically centralised entity. Instead, integration is
more informal and often private (the Five Eyes cooperation, board
interlocks, or ownership patterns), resulting in extremely elastic and
flexible yet robust and 'deep' ties that are frequently overlooked by
conventional analyses, but nonetheless bind. Occasional disagreements
(for example, about joining the AIIB) do not contradict this. On the
contrary, they are an immanent feature of the Anglo-American 'family'
and should not be overrated. The findings of this article show that
[Anglo-America clearly dominates the structure of global
finance]{.underline} with market shares in eight key segments between 43
per cent and 75 per cent. Hence, Anglo-America exerts dominant
structural power in global finance. Arguably, today Anglo-American
global finance -- a complex amalgam of public and private authority --
permeates almost every political economy in the world and influences
political and economic decision-making. At least in the OECD-world,
finance has become the 'super-structure', increasingly dominating the
structures of production and knowledge (though not necessarily
security). **[The global financial crisis]{.underline}**, which
developed in Anglo-America and then spread internationally, certainly
**[has led to growing scepticism and even resistance against the liberal
Anglo-American model of global finance amongst citizens and politicians
in a number of countries.]{.underline}**Footnote 95 However, business
and financial elites of most countries are still strongly attracted
towards Anglo-American markets and corporations. Once countries have
integrated themselves into the open international financial order
created and dominated by Anglo-America it becomes extremely costly to
extricate themselves from it. This is comparable to what Walter Russell
Mead has called the 'sticky' power of America.Footnote 96 The eurozone
and Japan are certainly stuck to this Anglo-American global financial
order. At present, [the only conceivable challenger to Anglo-America is
China]{.underline}, which is actively trying to increase its autonomy,
for example, through the AIIB. The findings of this article suggest a
coming dilemma for Beijing: if China wants to truly challenge
Anglo-America in the global structure of finance, it eventually will
need to abolish capital controls. This, however, would diminish
Beijing's control over domestic finance significantly and the interests
of Chinese business and financial elites would, over time, increasingly
align themselves to the Anglo-American centre, which, contrary to
conventional wisdom, is not in perpetual decline but enjoys persistent
structural power in global finance. A final note is in order, though.
[**The dominance of Anglo-America in global finance is** unambiguous yet
at the same time **marked by a high degree of latent fragility. Global
finance has not been re-regulated drastically after the global financial
crisis;Footnote 97 significant imbalances, inequalities and
contradictions persist and are even likely to grow, potentially
undermining the legitimacy and the stability of the whole
system.**]{.underline} However, most OECD countries (and increasingly
China too), have integrated themselves in the open global financial
order dominated by Anglo-America and are hence not inclined to directly
challenge it -- even though [the Anglophone centre]{.underline} (NY-LON)
[seems to reap significantly larger benefits]{.underline} than them.

The Lockean heartland concept, developed by Kees van der Pijl, is an IPE
approach integrating both political and economic dimensions.Footnote 18
The approach is named after John Locke who had generally argued for the
withdrawal of the state from social and economic life and for
self-regulation of civil society. According to van der Pijl, the Lockean
state/society complex became recognisable in England in the late
seventeenth century.Footnote 19 The Glorious Revolution of 1688 led to
the constitutional limitation of state power and the protection of the
genuinely 'private'. The pattern of self-government that settlers from
Britain brought with them to North America and Australia enabled the
subsequent transnationalisation of the Lockean state/society complex.
This formed the basis for the subsequent development of a transnational
Lockean heartland spanning across the English-speaking countries: 'with
the Lockean pattern transmitted to the new areas of settlement, there
emerged, on the foundations of industrial/commercial centrality and
predominance, a heartland of the global political economy'.Footnote 20
The counter model to this Lockean state is the 'Hobbesian' state, which
is characterised by the primacy of the state. The Hobbesian state
generally has an explicit doctrine of national interest and relies on a
powerful administration to regulate economy and society. In contrast,
the Lockean state generally relies much on free markets that are largely
seen as 'self-regulating'. The mode of expansion of the Lockean state is
transnational, whereas that of Hobbesian states is international. One of
the primary purposes of the Lockean state is to foster free (capitalist)
enterprise that 'civil society' (primarily the financial and business
elites) pursues at home and abroad. The predominance of the Lockean
heartland over the international political economy has been challenged
by other states that rose to power. Such 'Hobbesian contender states'
included Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union. [China
could become the next contender in a few decades]{.underline};Footnote
21 as a Hobbesian state it seeks to steer and regulate its economy
tightly -- particularly its financial markets. In addition to
Anglosphere and Lockean heartland, there is also the term Anglo-America.
Andrew Gamble argues that Anglo-America is an 'imagined community', one
that is 'encompassing both ideals and interests, which is constructed
and sustained through various narratives and embodied in particular
institutions'.Footnote 22 Furthermore, Anglo-America has not one
distinct centre, but consists of different states and nations, such as
Australia, Britain, Canada, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the US. He
argues that ['Anglo-America is a political space constituted by wider
economic, political, ideological and cultural
relationships]{.underline}, and is as a consequence many-sided'.Footnote
23 Similarly, Peter Katzenstein argues that Anglo-America is 'fluid, not
fixed'.Footnote 24 According to Gamble, the hegemony of Anglo-America
has four main dimensions. The first is military and has arguably been
the most apparent dimension during the last century. The second and
third dimensions are political, respectively cultural in nature: the
political model advocated by Anglo-America is based on the idea of
self-government, and the importance of (transnational) civil society;
Anglo-American culture, shaped by Protestantism and individualism,
manifests today primarily as consumerism. Finally, the fourth dimension
has been **[the dominant Anglo-American model of capitalism -- which is
characterised by the primacy of markets, short-term goals, and the
confinement of the state to enabling free enterprise rather than
actively steering economic development]{.underline}** --, and
particularly the dissemination of this liberal economic order around the
world. **[Gamble summarises the position of
Anglo-America]{.underline}**:Footnote 25 [Global hegemony is how
Anglo-America appears to those outside it]{.underline}, as a hegemonic
order fashioned over two hundred years, in which the differences between
its various states are less important than what they have in common.
[Empirical evidence for the existence of an Anglo-American model of
capitalism has been found by a number of scholars.]{.underline} Peter
Hall and David Soskice as well as Bruno Amable argue that the Anglophone
economies constitute a distinct socioeconomic model -- 'liberal market
economies' or 'market-based economies';Footnote 26 whereas countries
pursuing an opposing model, such as China, have been dubbed
'state-permeated market economies'.Footnote 27 Schwartz uses the term
'Americanised Rich' to characterise the group of Anglophone countries
(plus the Netherlands, Sweden, and tentatively Switzerland). He finds
that the group of the Americanised Rich has similar housing markets and
corporate finance systems to those of the US.Footnote 28 In addition,
these countries exhibit an overseas investment pattern comparable to the
US, and their inward and outward direct investment from/to America is
disproportionately high compared to other countries, such as the
'Repressed Rich' (Germany, France, Japan, and others). The exceptionally
close transnational ties between the Anglo-American countries are
reflected in various statistics pertaining to global finance. For
example, the UK is by far the largest source of direct investment into
the US when measured by country of ultimate beneficial owner.Footnote 29
The bilateral private portfolio investment relation between the US and
the UK is the largest one in the world by far with almost US \$2
trillion. Banking claims by foreign investors on the US, and vice versa
US banking claims on foreigners, are dominated by the Anglosphere --
over 60 per cent in each category.Footnote 30 Furthermore, investment
banking, hedge funds, private equity, and burgeoning passive asset
management (for example, BlackRock) are quintessentially Anglo-American
financial industries, based around New York and London -- and virtually
nowhere else. The same is true for the top global law firms. Dariusz
Wójcik uses the apt term 'NY-LON' to capture the joint global dominance
of both intertwined financial centres.Footnote 31 Jeremy Green argues
that there has been a close interaction between the Federal
Reserve-Treasury-Wall Street nexus in the US and the City-Bank-Treasury
nexus in the UK.Footnote 32 Moreover, a 'transatlantic regulatory
feedback loop' between the US and the UK fostered international
financial liberalisation and deregulation, making Anglo-America
fundamental to the process of financial globalisation.Footnote 33 The
dominance of Anglo-America in finance is underpinned by common law,
which provides extensive freedom of contract. The legal systems of all
Anglophone countries and territories are based on common law, in which
law evolves in a bottom-up fashion from individual case decisions, thus
significantly facilitating (transnational) finance. Under civil law
(Germany, France, Japan, etc.) the state creates law in a top-down
manner, which is rather hampering finance -- this contrast between
common and civil law reflects the Lockean/Hobbesian dichotomy by van der
Pijl.

### 2NC\-\--UQ\-\--China Conflict

#### The Ukraine War has made it clear that competition between US and China for global hegemony is high now -- Taiwan is still the most likely flash point

[The war in Ukraine is part of the struggle for a new world order.
Russia and China are openly challenging the Pax Americana.]{.underline}
But the question how the next world order will look like remains open.
In Moscow and Beijing, but also in Washington, [the model of a
multipolar concert of the great powers, with exclusive zones of
influence, is finding support]{.underline}. Despite a growing
unwillingness to play the role of 'the world\'s policeman', however,
[the majority of Americans have not yet abandoned the unipolar,
American, liberal world order.]{.underline} And not only [in China,
there is still support for the Westphalian model with its emphasis on
nation state sovereignty and its condemnation of post-colonial meddling
in internal affairs. These three models envision very different ground
rules]{.underline}. Who is authorised to use force -- all states, only
the strongest, or only the hegemonic power? Does the law of the
strongest apply, or the strength of the law? Is there a historical ideal
(e.g. liberal democracy and market economy) towards which all states
will (or should) develop, or are there multiple modernities with
competing political systems and cultural civilisations that can coexist
more or less peacefully? Will there be a global showdown between an
alliance of democracies and the 'axis of autocrats'? Or is the price of
peace giving up on implementing universal human rights? [Which of these
models will prevail]{.underline} -- or from what precise mixture of old
and new elements the new world order will emerge -- [will determine not
only war and peace, but also what the global energy, production,
distribution, and financial systems of the future will look
like.]{.underline} The global energy system In the German debate, under
the immediate impact of the war, the focus is mostly on how to deny
Russia the revenue from its oil and gas exports without asking too much
of consumers who are dependent on Russian energy supplies. In the long
term, this dependence is to be reduced by accelerating the energy
transition away from fossil fuels. [Less attention is being paid to the
efforts of China and India to avail themselves of the cheapest possible
supplies on the Russian energy market without being hit by Western
sanctions.]{.underline} And [far too little attention is being paid to
the efforts of important suppliers and their customers to 'de-dollarise'
the international energy trade.]{.underline} It takes little imagination
to foresee the biggest shake-up in global energy trading since the oil
price shocks of the 1970s. What is less clear, however, is the direction
in which the global energy system will move. [Given the ongoing
geopolitical confrontation, the imperatives of climate protection and
energy security are now pointing in the same direction]{.underline}. On
the one hand, this is likely to further accelerate the exodus of global
capital from fossil industries. On the other hand, the industrialised
countries are technologically still not in a position to free themselves
from their addiction to fossil fuels. And it is precisely the bridging
technology of natural gas that has now hit a geopolitical dead end. In
the short term, Germany will hardly be able to close the looming supply
gap without committing climate policy sins involving coal and nuclear
power. In the long term, alongside renewable energies, the international
supply chains for hydrogen need to be developed at pace. The US is
trying to slow down the economic rise of its rival China. In the medium
term, however, this means having to satisfy the demand for gas by
diversifying suppliers. Surprising shifts of alliances, involving both
old enemies (e.g. the US and Venezuela) and old friends (e.g. the West
and the Arab monarchies; Russia and Kazakhstan), cannot be ruled out.
How quickly, in this competitive world, the need to secure national
energy supplies can collide with the principles of value-based foreign
policy was something the new German government had to discover in its
very first days in office. The global division of labour (production and
supply chains) Since the 2008 financial crisis, global trade and
cross-border investments have not really picked up again. [The Covid-19
crisis has made people more aware of the vulnerability of global supply
chains.]{.underline} The failure of China's Zero Covid strategy and the
drastic lockdowns in Shenzhen and Shanghai indicate that, two years now
after the outbreak of the pandemic, the risk of disruptions to global
supply chains has still not been eliminated. If parts from the Far East
are missing, the assembly lines in Europe, too, come to a standstill.
[The paradigm shift away from efficiency]{.underline} ('Just in Time')
[to greater resilience]{.underline} ('Just in Case') [is accelerating
the hidden trend towards deglobalisation that has been under way for
some time. But geo-economic as well as geopolitical motives also favour
the shortening and unbundling of supply chains, and are now driving the
separation and isolation of markets. **The US is trying to slow down the
economic rise of its rival China.**]{.underline} Behind the scenes,
pressure from both is mounting on their allies and on third countries to
choose sides. Europeans and Asians are still resisting being drawn into
this new Cold War. But [the disputes over gas pipelines, chip
manufacturers, and the 5G communications infrastructure show how quickly
companies and entire states can get caught between opposing
fronts.]{.underline} [The]{.underline} ultimate [outcome of this
development could quite possibly be rival blocs that make it difficult
or impossible for unwanted competitors to access their
markets.]{.underline} Hardly have they escaped Trump-America's
sanctions, German companies are now facing headwinds on the Chinese
market. Nevertheless, [the majority is resisting the pressure to
decouple from China, while some double down on the Chinese market
despite ever worsening conditions]{.underline}. Given the importance of
the Chinese market, the call in the Federal Government\'s Indo-Pacific
strategy paper to reduce one-sided dependencies through diversification
therefore often goes unheard. But t[he Russian war of aggression against
Ukraine might now alter this calculus. Hardly anyone would have thought
it possible that the West would react so quickly, so strongly, and with
such unity to Russian aggression. Russia's expulsion from the SWIFT
system, the sanctions against the Russian central bank, but also the
voluntary withdrawal of Western companies from the Russian market, all
this has made its mark -- not least in China.]{.underline} Even some in
Germany were surprised at how quickly even supposedly sacred cows like
[the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline were slaughtered]{.underline}. This
experience of enormous public and political pressure is likely to lead
many German companies to reassess their strategies towards other
'problematic markets'. Should the sales opportunities for German
business in global markets be closed off in the medium-term future,
Germany will have to rethink what it is willing to do to lead the vital
European home market out of its protracted crisis. Less well known is
the geostrategic motivation behind the Belt and Road Initiative. [The
realignment of the global economy according to geopolitical interests is
putting key industries]{.underline} such as the German car industry
[under pressure]{.underline}. If the engine of growth falters,
distribution conflicts within and between societies intensify. Fear of
social decline is increasing even among the middle classes. [This fear
of decline is the sounding board that populists use for their agitation
against the preconditions for the success of the export model, the free
flow of goods, capital, people, and ideas.]{.underline} T[he global
trend towards protectionism is thus driven not only by external factors
but also by internal pressure]{.underline}. In such a world, there can
no longer be any world champions in exporting. Germany above all will
therefore have to rethink its export-oriented economic model.
Infrastructure When Western critics discuss the Chinese Silk Road
project, their focus is usually on debt traps or on the creation of
political dependencies. There is a justified suspicion that the mammoth
project represents a Chinese push to become a dominant power in Asia and
in the world. Less well known, however, is the geostrategic motivation
behind the Belt and Road Initiative. Since the end of World War II, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has established bases on a
chain of islands running from Japan in the north to Indonesia in the
south]{.underline}. And since the Obama administration announced [its
'Pivot to Asia', the US has been concentrating its forces
here.]{.underline} Between the Strait of Malacca and the Strait of
Hormuz (the Americans call these straits 'choke points'), [the United
States and its allies can block Chinese trade and supply routes at any
time. **China feels encircled and reacts in an aggressively defensive
manner.**]{.underline} The aim of its arms build-up in the East and
South China Seas is to break through the 'First Island Chain', and to
drive the US out of Chinese coastal waters. [Chinese hawks go one step
further and want to force the reunification of the 'unsinkable American
aircraft carrier' Taiwan with the motherland]{.underline}. As Chinese
bombers fly over Taipei, [Chinese propaganda accuses the US of
challenging the status quo by questioning the One China policy, and thus
provoking a conflict. This is a highly dangerous poker game, not only
because Taiwan produces indispensable semiconductor chips, but also
because from the perspective of the Americans, traumatised by Pearl
Harbor, the defence of their homeland begins at the First Island
Chain.]{.underline} So **[in the Taiwan Strait lies a fuse that could
set off World War III.]{.underline}** By means of the Silk Road project,
[China is therefore trying to break out of the American stranglehold
towards the West]{.underline}. The immediate goal of the numerous ports,
corridors, and railway lines is to prevent the disruption of Chinese
supply routes. [The initial enthusiasm of the landlocked states of
Central Asia shows the high hopes held by the BRI partners that the
strategy for connectivity along the ancient Silk Road will lead to
prosperity gains for all. The real prize, however, lies at the other end
of Eurasia: the European market,]{.underline} which is supposed to
guarantee sales opportunities for Chinese products in the long run. [If
Beijing succeeds in tying Europe closer, China and Russia will have
taken a big step towards their goal of neutralising US influence in
Eurasia]{.underline}. [Chinese hawks now see in the sanctions against
Russia an opportunity to attack the supremacy of the US
dollar.]{.underline} With the start of a new Cold War, however, [a new
Iron Curtain now threatens to cut through the Chinese Silk
Road]{.underline}. From China's point of view, that would be a
geostrategic catastrophe. This is one reason why [China, despite the
only recently proclaimed 'limitless friendship', does not really provide
substantive assistance to]{.underline} its junior partner
[Russia]{.underline} (the second reason is the Russian recognition of
two breakaway provinces of a sovereign state; looking at Taiwan, a
Chinese horror scenario). [Beijing thus has a vested interest in a quick
end to the Ukraine war]{.underline} (but is reluctant to take on the
responsibility of a mediator). If this does not happen, [China is likely
to push forward with the expansion of the maritime Silk
Roads.]{.underline} Money and financial markets [From the point of view
of Chinese strategists,]{.underline} following the decline of American
industry, the remaining foundation -- and thus [**the Achilles' heel --
of US hegemony is the role of the dollar** as the reserve currency on
the international goods and financial markets.]{.underline} China has
therefore been tinkering for some time on an alternative to the SWIFT
system ('CIPS') and on a digital currency (Digital Yuan, e-CNY).
However, neither of these instruments is yet ready to pose a real threat
to the greenback**[. Chinese hawks now see in the sanctions against
Russia an opportunity to attack the supremacy of the US
dollar]{.underline}**. The freezing of Russian central bank reserves has
put all the world's central banks on high alert. In order not to be
blackmailed themselves, they are now likely to shift reserves on a grand
scale. If this is at the expense of US investments, it could destabilise
the dollar's position as the global reserve currency[. The role of the
US dollar as a transaction currency is also a source of
frustration]{.underline}. After all, the inflationary pressure emanating
from the American Federal Reserve is passed on around the globe by all
those actors who rely on the US dollar for conducting their cross-border
trades. Russia, China, India, and Iran have therefore been trying for
some time to 'de-dollarise' their economies by using a broader basket of
currencies for their foreign trade. It is therefore hardly surprising
that Russia now wants to settle its oil and gas transactions only in
roubles. [China's attempts to de-dollarise its own foreign trade also
aligns with Beijing's strategic goal of upgrading the global status of
its own currency. But if a US ally like Saudi Arabia is now seriously
negotiating to settle its oil deals with China in yuan, this shows **how
widespread is the resentment of the hegemon**.]{.underline} This is not
risk-free, because [after the abandonment of the gold standard the US
dollar was tied to the central commodity of fossil industrial capitalism
by the clearing and settlement processes for the global oil
trade.]{.underline} If other OPEC countries were to abandon the
petrodollar, [the returning greenbacks would probably further increase
inflationary pressures in the US in the short term. In the long term,
both the Chinese RMB and blockchain-based cryptocurrencies could mature
into stable transaction currencies.]{.underline} US-sceptical
strategists believe that if the US dollar's functions as a reserve,
investment, and transaction currency do indeed continue to erode, then
the position of the US currency as the global reserve currency could
actually begin to totter. American hawks want to 'bleed the Russians to
send a signal to the Chinese to keep their hands off Taiwan'. However,
even after a decade and a half, efforts aiming at 'de-dollarisation'
have not seriously jeopardised the position of the US dollar as the
global reserve currency. As recently as last year, 90 per cent of all
foreign exchange transactions continued to be settled in US dollars, and
60 per cent of all central bank reserves are invested in dollars. The
blockchain cryptocurrencies in particular are a long way from being able
to replace the dollar.And whether a Chinese (digital) currency without
open Chinese financial markets can actually take over the functions of a
reserve currency is doubtful. American experts therefore believe that
the dollar's position is even more entrenched today because foreign
central banks know that in an emergency the American Fed will do
everything to shore up the dollar-denominated part of the financial
system[. What the coming world order will look like will be decided by
global power relations]{.underline}. Russia has overestimated its own
strength. **[Even if Moscow still succeeds in winning the war in Ukraine
militarily, in geopolitical terms it will fall back into the second tier
as China's junior partner.]{.underline}** However, [the new instability
on the European continent is likely to dampen the economic outlook for
Western Europe as well.]{.underline} Following the Ukrainian reality
check, [geopolitical dreams of an independent European power pole will
therefore certainly be re-evaluated by EU member states.]{.underline}
This leaves only China and the United States as powers capable of
setting and maintaining order. This explains why Washington and Beijing
do not wish to be drawn into this 'European conflict': **[the two
superpowers read the conflict above all through the lens of their
competition over global hegemony.]{.underline}** Accordingly, American
hawks want to 'bleed the Russians to send a signal to the Chinese to
keep their hands off Taiwan'. Although this is not uncontroversial in
Washington, a bipartisan coalition for a Cold War against the 'alliance
of autocracies' has already been in place for some time. In Beijing, on
the other hand, there is still disagreement as to whether it is really
in China's interests to disappear behind a new Iron Curtain alongside a
weakening Russian pariah, or whether China would not benefit much more
in the long run from an open world order. Geopolitically, [it would
therefore be a fatal mistake to over-hastily lump the Chinese and the
Russians together in an 'axis of autocracies']{.underline}. It would be
better instead to examine together what a rules-based, multilateral
order might look like, one that provided a framework within which the
core interests and security concerns of all the powers could be
peaceably negotiated and reconciled. Those who think this is unrealistic
should remember the last Cold War: then, too, cooperation between
systemic rivals within the framework of agreed ground rules was
successful.

Much has already been said about the recent heightening of U.S.-China
tensions and its potential fallout. What gets less attention is how the
U.S. and China themselves perceive the status of their relationship, and
how that affects their plans for the future. [An analysis of prevailing
elite opinion in the U.S. and China---starting with reactions to the
Nov. 16 virtual summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese
leader Xi Jinping---can shed light on how each side understands the
**root causes of the current competition**]{.underline}, and why they
believe they can overcome them. For the United States, the rivalry is
driven by China's challenge to U.S. power and leadership, as well as its
belief that Beijing is trying to alter the international order for its
own benefit. [For Beijing, it is driven by the United States' continued
**"hegemonic" pretensions** amid what Chinese elites see as its
**inevitable decline**.]{.underline} While both Washington and [Beijing
believe that their relationship will be primarily defined by competition
rather than cooperation for the foreseeable future, there are
nonetheless indications that both states are hoping to protect
themselves by establishing new "guardrails" to provide **strategic
stability**, even as they continue to **compete with one
another**.]{.underline} But doing so will be difficult. A Study in
Contrasts Both the U.S. and China framed the Biden-Xi virtual summit of
Nov. 16 as a "polite" but "straightforward" exchange on major areas of
contention. Yet a comparison of the two sides' readouts of the
discussion also demonstrates that each country has a fundamentally
different understanding of their positioning relative to one another, in
addition to their divergent objectives. The White House statement is
brief, comprising a mere four paragraphs. It begins by noting that Biden
and Xi acknowledged the "importance of managing competition
responsibly," framed by an understanding of where their "interests
align," and where their "interests, values, and perspectives diverge."
[According to the White House, the U.S. and China align on climate
change; on regional security challenges such as those posed by
Afghanistan and North Korea; and on "managing strategic risks" in the
bilateral relationship.]{.underline} In particular, Biden emphasized the
need for "common-sense guardrails to ensure that competition does not
veer into conflict and to keep lines of communication open." From there,
the Biden team devoted far more attention to the divergences, naming
specific topics like Taiwanese sovereignty, ongoing trade disputes and
human rights violations in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. The memo is
prefaced with the statement that the U.S. would "continue to stand up
for its interests and values and, together with our allies and partners,
ensure the rules of the road for the 21st century advance an
international system that is free, open, and fair." For the United
States, then, the defense of its "interests and values" is inextricably
bound to the future of a "free, open and fair" international order.
Biden's team sees stabilizing the U.S.-China relationship as a
significant part of its broader efforts to restore U.S. global
leadership and revitalize U.S. power after the chaos of former President
Donald Trump's term. More importantly, the readout underscores the fact
that Biden sees China as an obstacle to achieving those goals.
[Beijing's readout, which is much longer, also notes areas of shared
interest like climate change and expresses a desire to establish
"guardrails." While "it is only natural that China and the United States
have differences," the statement says, both share an interest in
"constructively" managing relations to "avoid expansion and
intensification" of disagreements.]{.underline} But the Chinese readout
also bears stark contrasts to that of the Biden administration,
particularly when it comes to three issues: its view on China's current
global status, its conceptions of international order and its assessment
of U.S. intentions. First, Beijing repeatedly emphasizes a fundamental
equality of status and role between the U.S. and China. The opening
paragraph claims that "as the world's top two economies and permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council," Beijing and Washington "should
strengthen communication and cooperation," not only for the benefit of
their own citizens, but to "also shoulder our due international
responsibilities." [According to Beijing, then, both countries already
share global leadership.]{.underline} Second, Beijing disputes the
implication that China is trying to spread its authoritarian system of
government to other countries, thereby posing a challenge U.S. values
and interests, as well as the broader international order. It asserts
that while China's development and modernization is an "inevitable
historical trend," China "has no intention of selling its own path to
the world." Instead, Beijing says it would encourage other countries "to
find a path of development that suits their national conditions." Rather
than an international order defined by "interfering in the internal
affairs of other countries through human rights issues," as the Chinese
readout puts it, China's preference, according to Xi, is for both China
and the U.S. to "safeguard ... an international order based on
international law and basic norms of international relations" that
derive from the "purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter." This
reflects Beijing's historical emphasis on the U.N. Charter's guarantees
of non-interference and state sovereignty over its guarantees of human
rights, the tabling of which it portrays as an instrument by which the
U.S. is trying to stifle China's rise. Third, the Chinese readout quotes
Biden as stating: China was already a great power 5,000 years ago. I
want to reiterate clearly that the U.S. does not seek to change China's
system of governance, does not seek to counter China through alliances
and has no intention to have conflict with China. The U.S. government is
devoted to pursuing the long-standing One China policy, does not support
Taiwan independence and hopes that the Taiwan Strait will remain
peaceful and stable. This quote does not appear in the White House
version, and Biden's team has not confirmed or denied its accuracy.
[Nonetheless, its inclusion is significant, because it sheds light on
what China **would like to hear** from the United States: recognition of
China's great power status; **assurances that the U.S. does not seek to
overthrow** the ruling Chinese Communist Party or go to war with China;
and assurances that the U.S. still abides by the One China policy, which
Beijing frames as supporting Chinese sovereignty over
Taiwan.]{.underline} A Struggle for Two Orders In light of these
differences, how should tensions between the U.S. and China be managed?
[The views of each country's foreign policy specialists can provide some
clues here. What is striking is that they tend to be mirror images of
one another, suggesting that "**strategic competition**" may remain the
default posture for the **foreseeable future.**]{.underline}

[The first modern surge of Beijing's declinist narrative began in the
wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and was given a scientific
sheen by relying on metrics that measured "comprehensive national
power." It was not just a perception that America was sliding toward
second-tier status, but an empirical fact. There was yet another uptick
in declinism in 2016, after the election of Donald Trump and the rise of
anti-globalization populism. Events in the U.S. over the past 12 months
have given declinists in China a steroids shot: The U.S. mishandling of
the Covid-19 pandemic, the resulting economic recession, demonstrations
sparked by the killing of George Floyd and the chaos after Trump
disputed the outcome of the presidential election have resulted in a
**full-blown euphoria**. Two days after pro-Trump rioters stormed the
Capitol Building, an article in the People\'s Liberation Army Daily
declared, "The shocking events at \[the Capitol Building\] highlight a
grim reality: Not only has the United States been severely impacted by
Covid-19 and an economic recession, but it's political system and
society are also experiencing a deep crises."]{.underline} Then, of
course, came the power crisis in Texas last month, during which the
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson took time from a regular briefing
to crow that the [chaos]{.underline} in Houston ["made us believe more
strongly that **China is on the right path**."]{.underline} Writing in
the Beijing Daily recently, [China University of Political Science and
Law professor Qi Kai declared]{.underline}, "Texas is the second most
economically powerful state in the U.S., and is a major energy-producing
state, \[and so\] it is amazing that such a serious power outage
accident occurred. [In my opinion, this reflects American society's
chaotic ecosystem." **The message from Beijing is simple: America is
broken.**]{.underline} "America's Main Opponent is Itself," proclaimed
the headline in a recent edition of the People's Daily. The article's
author, a researcher at the China Institute for International Studies,
argued, "The United States has arrived at its current situation because
the design and operation of its political and economic system has gone
awry, the inevitable result of the short-sighted pursuit of profit." [It
would be easy --- and comforting --- to dismiss this as mere propaganda,
and of course we don't know just how deep the declinist consensus is in
China, owing to the tight constraints on open discourse and
unavailability of robust polling data. But your host believes that we've
reached a tipping point, with a growing narrative of cautious confidence
that's emboldened by data points of decline in America.]{.underline}

[In China, meanwhile, foreign policy specialists' views about engagement
with the U.S. have gone through several stages since the 1990s, each of
which corresponded to a different view on what U.S. "hegemony" means for
China]{.underline}. During the 1990s, the consensus view was that China
had to marshal its "comprehensive national power" to resist U.S.
pressure during Washington's "unipolar moment." In the subsequent
decade, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, [Chinese analysts began to see
the key inflection points of the era---the global war on terrorism, the
2003 Iraq War and the 2008 global financial crisis---as opportunities
for China to take advantage of Washington's distraction. Beijing began
to embrace a strategy of **"peaceful rise,"**]{.underline} with rhetoric
assuaging regional concerns about its intentions. The next shift, toward
a more proactive approach, came during Xi Jinping's first term as
China's president, starting in 2013. [Under the overall goal of
"national rejuvenation," Beijing sought to harness Chinese power to
build a "community of common destiny," allowing it to shape the
international order. During this time, some Chinese foreign policy
specialists claimed not only that the U.S. was in decline, but that so
too was "hegemony" as an ordering principle of international
relations]{.underline}. This view made it possible to present Xi's
proposed "community of common destiny" concept not as China's own
hegemonic project, but as a vision for a more pluralistic world that
would replace U.S. hegemony. [Finally, in the past five years, during
Xi's second term, Chinese elites have realized that Washington would not
go quietly into the night. Instead, they began to see the U.S. as a
"**declining" hegemon**]{.underline} lashing out at its supposed
challengers. [The "conventional wisdom," as the influential foreign
policy specialist Wang Jisi noted, now holds that the U.S. is "driven by
fear and envy to contain China in every possible way," making it "the
greatest external challenge to China's national security, sovereignty
and internal stability." In this sense, Chinese specialists frame their
country as being in a struggle for "two orders": the domestic order,
which would be secured through continued CCP rule, and the international
order, where China needs to defend against efforts to limit its
influence]{.underline}. This view of U.S. aggression was clearly
expressed in Chinese analysts' assessments of the Biden-Xi summit. Zhao
Minghao, for instance, described a U.S. that, "having failed to win the
trade war," is now "maliciously" playing the Taiwan card to "interrupt
China's peaceful rise through a war." Others, like Wang Honggang, note
that while Biden appears more interested in multilateralism than Trump,
the "beginning and end of the Biden administration's strategic thinking
is still to preserve American hegemony." He argues that the Biden
administration is seeking to signal that it "has strength" out of fears
that the Trump years damaged the United States' credibility and
influence. In fact, he argues, it is a "weak government." Finally, Huang
Renwei of Fudan University has argued that U.S.-China relations are
following the three phases of war identified in "On Protracted War," Mao
Zedong's 1938 treatise: strategic defense, strategic stalemate and the
strategic counteroffensive. [According to Huang, U.S.-China relations
are currently in the phase of "**strategic stalemate**" and may stay
there for some time, since the U.S. "does not have the ability and will
to devote all its resources to the confrontation with China, thus
limiting the scale of the confrontation." That gives China the upper
hand, Huang says, because if the U.S. "continues to intensify its
efforts against China over a period of time, its expended resources and
costs will overwhelm the U.S. itself, at which point the strategic
stalemate will shift in China\'s favor."]{.underline}

[There is an entire swath of literature, known as "power transition
theory," which holds that **great-power war** typically occurs at the
intersection of one hegemon's rise and another's decline.]{.underline}
This is the body of work underpinning the Thucydides Trap, and there is,
admittedly, an elemental truth to the idea. The rise of new powers is
invariably destabilizing. In the runup to the Peloponnesian War in the
5th century B.C., Athens would not have seemed so menacing to Sparta had
it not built a vast empire and become a naval superpower. Washington and
Beijing would not be locked in rivalry if China was still poor and weak.
Rising powers do expand their influence in ways that threaten reigning
powers. [But the calculus that produces war---particularly the calculus
that pushes revisionist powers, countries seeking to shake up the
existing system, to lash out violently---is **more
complex**.]{.underline} A country whose relative wealth and power are
growing will surely become more assertive and ambitious. All things
equal, it will seek greater global influence and prestige. [But if its
position is steadily improving, it should **postpone** a]{.underline}
deadly [showdown with the reigning hegemon until it has become even
stronger. Such a country should follow the dictum former Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping laid down for a rising China after the Cold War: It should
hide its capabilities and **bide its time**. Now imagine a different
scenario. A dissatisfied state has been building its power and expanding
its geopolitical horizons. But then the country peaks]{.underline},
perhaps because its economy slows, [perhaps because]{.underline} its own
assertiveness provokes [**a coalition of determined
rivals**,]{.underline} or perhaps because both of these things happen at
once. [The future starts to look quite forbidding; a sense of **imminent
danger** starts to replace a feeling of limitless possibility. In these
circumstances, **a revisionist power may act boldly, even
aggressively**, to grab what it can before it is too late. The most
dangerous trajectory in world politics is a long rise followed by the
prospect of a sharp decline. As we show in our forthcoming book, Danger
Zone: The Coming Conflict with **China**, this scenario is more common
than you might think.]{.underline} Historian Donald Kagan showed, for
instance, [that Athens started acting more belligerently]{.underline} in
the years before the Peloponnesian War because it feared adverse shifts
in the balance of naval power---in other words[, because it was on the
**verge of losing influence** vis-à-vis Sparta. We see the same thing in
more recent cases as well.]{.underline} Over the past 150 years, peaking
powers---[great powers that had been growing dramatically faster than
the world average and then suffered a severe, prolonged
slowdown---usually **don't fade away quietly**. Rather, they become
**brash and aggressive**.]{.underline} They suppress dissent at home and
try to regain economic momentum by creating exclusive spheres of
influence abroad. [They pour money into their militaries and use force
to expand their influence. This behavior commonly provokes great-power
tensions. In some cases, it touches **disastrous wars**.]{.underline}
This shouldn't be surprising. Eras of rapid growth supercharge a
country's ambitions, raise its people's expectations, and make its
rivals nervous. During a sustained economic boom, businesses enjoy
rising profits and citizens get used to living large. The country
becomes a bigger player on the global stage. Then stagnation strikes.
Slowing growth makes it harder for leaders to keep the public happy.
Economic underperformance weakens the country against its rivals.
[Fearing upheaval, leaders crack down on dissent. They maneuver
desperately to keep geopolitical enemies at bay. **Expansion seems like
a solution**---a way of grabbing economic resources and markets, making
nationalism a crutch for a wounded regime, and beating back foreign
threats. Many countries have followed this path]{.underline}. [When the
United States' long post-Civil War economic surge ended, Washington
violently suppressed strikes and unrest at home, built a powerful
blue-water Navy, and engaged in a fit of belligerence and imperial
expansion during the 1890s.]{.underline} After a fast-rising imperial
Russia fell into a deep slump at the turn of the 20th century, the
tsarist government cracked down hard while also enlarging its military,
seeking colonial gains in East Asia and sending around 170,000 soldiers
to occupy Manchuria. [These moves backfired spectacularly: They
antagonized Japan, which beat Russia in the first great-power war of the
20th century. A century later, Russia became aggressive under similar
circumstances. Facing a severe, post-2008 economic slowdown, Russian
President Vladimir Putin invaded two neighboring countries, sought to
create a new Eurasian economic bloc, staked Moscow's claim to a
resource-rich Arctic, and steered Russia deeper into
dictatorship.]{.underline} Even democratic France engaged in anxious
aggrandizement after the end of its postwar economic expansion in the
1970s. It tried to rebuild its old sphere of influence in Africa,
deploying 14,000 troops to its former colonies and undertaking a dozen
military interventions over the next two decades. All of these cases
were complicated, yet the [pattern is clear. If a rapid rise gives
countries the means to act boldly, the **fear of decline** serves up a
powerful motive for rasher, more urgent expansion. The same thing often
happens when]{.underline} fast-rising powers cause their own
[**containment by a hostile coalition**. In fact, some of history's
**most gruesome wars** have come when **revisionist powers concluded
their path to glory was about to be blocked.** Imperial Germany and
Japan are textbook examples.]{.underline} Germany's rivalry with Britain
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is often considered an
analogue to U.S.-China competition: In both cases, an autocratic
challenger threatened a liberal hegemon. But the more sobering parallel
is this: War came when a cornered Germany grasped it would not zip past
its rivals without a fight. For decades after unification in 1871,
Germany soared. Its factories spewed out iron and steel, erasing
Britain's economic lead. Berlin built Europe's finest army and
battleships that threatened British supremacy at sea. By the early
1900s, Germany was a European heavyweight seeking an enormous sphere of
influence---a Mitteleuropa, or Middle Europe­---on the continent. It was
also pursuing, under then-Kaiser Wilhelm II, a "world policy" aimed at
securing colonies and global power. But during the prelude to war, the
kaiser and his aides didn't feel confident. Germany's brash behavior
caused its encirclement by hostile powers. London, Paris, and St.
Petersburg, Russia, formed a "Triple Entente" to block German expansion.
By 1914, time was running short. Germany was losing ground economically
to a fast-growing Russia; London and France were pursuing economic
containment by blocking its access to oil and iron ore. Berlin's key
ally, Austria-Hungary, was being torn apart by ethnic tensions. At home,
Germany's autocratic political system was in trouble. Most ominous, the
military balance was shifting. France was enlarging its army; Russia was
adding 470,000 men to its military and slashing the time it needed to
mobilize for war. Britain announced it would build two battleships for
every one built by Berlin. Germany was, for the moment, Europe's
foremost military power. But by 1916 and 1917, it would be hopelessly
overmatched. The result was a now-or-never mentality: Germany should
"defeat the enemy while we still stand a chance of victory," declared
Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke, even if that meant "provoking a war
in the near future." This is what happened after Serbian nationalists
assassinated Austria's crown prince in June 1914. The kaiser's
government urged Austria-Hungary to crush Serbia, even though that meant
war with Russia and France. It then invaded neutral Belgium---the key to
its Schlieffen Plan for a two-front war---despite the likelihood of
provoking Britain. "This war will turn into a world war in which England
will also intervene," Moltke acknowledged. Germany's rise had given it
the power to gamble for greatness. Its impending decline drove the
decisions that plunged the world into war. Imperial Japan followed a
similar trajectory. For a half-century after the Meiji Restoration in
1868, Japan was rising steadily. The building of a modern economy and a
fierce military allowed Tokyo to win two major wars and accumulate
colonial privileges in China, Taiwan, and the Korean Peninsula. Yet
Japan was not a hyper-belligerent predator: Through the 1920s, it
cooperated with the United States, Britain, and other countries to
create a cooperative security framework in the Asia-Pacific. During that
decade, however, things fell apart. Growth dropped from 6.1 percent
annually between 1904 and 1919 to 1.8 percent annually in the 1920s; the
Great Depression then shut Japan's overseas markets. Unemployment
soared, and bankrupt farmers sold their daughters. In China, meanwhile,
Japanese influence was being challenged by the Soviet Union and a rising
nationalist movement under then-Chinese leader Chiang Kai-Shek. Tokyo's
answer was fascism at home and aggression abroad. From the late 1920s
onward, the military conducted a slow-motion coup and harnessed the
nation's resources for "total war." Japan initiated a massive military
buildup and violently established a vast sphere of influence, seizing
Manchuria in 1931, invading China in 1937, and laying plans to conquer
resource-rich colonies and strategic islands across the Asia-Pacific.
The goal was to build an autarkic empire; the result drew a strategic
noose around Tokyo's neck. Japan's push into China eventually led to a
punishing war with the Soviet Union. Japan's designs on Southeast Asia
alarmed Britain. Its drive for regional primacy also made it a foe of
the United States---the country from which Tokyo imported nearly all of
its oil with an economy vastly larger than Japan's. Tokyo had
antagonized an overwhelming coalition of enemies. It then risked
everything rather than accepting humiliation and decline. The
precipitating cause, again, was a closing window of opportunity. By
1941, the United States was building an unbeatable military. In July,
then-U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt imposed an oil embargo that
threatened to stop Japan's expansion in its tracks. But Japan still had
a temporary military edge in the Pacific Ocean, thanks to its early
rearmament. So it used that advantage in a lightning attack---seizing
the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and other possessions from
Singapore to Wake Island as well as bombing the U.S. fleet at Pearl
Harbor---which guaranteed its own destruction. Japan's prospects for
victory were dim, acknowledged then-Japanese Gen. Hideki Tojo, yet there
was no choice but to "close one's eyes and jump." A revisionist Japan
became most violent when it saw that time was running out. [This is the
**real trap** the United States should worry about regarding **China**
today---the trap in which an aspiring superpower]{.underline} peaks and
then [**refuses to bear** the painful consequences of
descent.]{.underline} China's rise is no mirage: [Decades of growth have
given Beijing the economic sinews of global power. Major investments in
key technologies and communications infrastructure have yielded a strong
position in the struggle for geoeconomic influence; China is using a
multi-continent Belt and Road Initiative to bring other states into its
orbit. Most alarming, think tank assessments and U.S. Defense Department
reports show China's increasingly formidable military now stands a real
chance of **winning a war** against the United States in the Western
Pacific.]{.underline}

#### The [threat]{.underline} of China is [made up]{.underline} in pursuit of US heg. 

**Swaine 20**, director of the East Asia program at the Quincy
Institute, 3-31-2020, (Michael, \"China Doesn't Pose an Existential
Threat for America,\" Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/21/china-existential-threat-america/>,
kav)

It has become a cottage industry in Washington and in parts of Europe
these days to highlight all the many ways in which China threatens U.S.,
Western, and Asian interests. [Politicians, military officers, and
pundits take turns describing the dangers posed by Beijing's
"expansionist" and "aggressive" military, "implacably hostile" ideology,
"predatory" economic and tech policies, and "insidious" overseas
influence operations]{.underline}.

Despite shunning the Trump administration's habitual use of most of
these inflammatory adjectives, U.S. President Joe Biden and Secretary of
State Antony Blinken nonetheless depict Beijing as challenging the
entire "rules-based order that maintains global stability" and as the
major focal point of a global struggle between democracy and
authoritarianism, which is now, according to Biden, at an "inflection
point."

[Such language echoes the premise]{.underline} of various strategy
documents of the Trump administration and the speeches of former
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: [that the United States is now locked in
a strategic, great-power rivalry with China that overshadows any other
foreign]{.underline} (or even domestic) [threats or concerns facing the
country.]{.underline}

There is no doubt that Beijing's behavior in many areas challenges
existing U.S. and allied interests and democratic values. Particularly
under Xi Jinping, China has used its greater economic and military power
to intimidate rival claimants in territorial disputes and punish nations
that make statements or take what Beijing views as threatening or
insulting actions. It has engaged in extensive commercial hacking and
theft of technologies and favors military intimidation over dialogue in
dealing with Taiwan. And it has employed draconian, repressive policies
in Tibet and Xinjiang and suppressed democratic freedoms in Hong Kong.

This deeply troubling behavior certainly requires a strong, concerted
response from the United States and other nations. But to be effective,
such a response also requires an accurate assessment of China's future
impact on the United States and the world.

And in this regard, [it is extremely counterproductive to U.S. interests
to assert or even imply, as many now do, that the above Chinese actions
constitute an all-of-society, existential threat to the United States,
the West, and ultimately the entire world, thereby justifying a Cold
War-style, zero-sum containment stance toward Beijing. Such an extreme
stance stifles debate and the search for more positive-sum policy
outcomes while leading to the usual calls for major increases in defense
spending.]{.underline}

[In fact, there isn't much actual evidence to support the notion of
China as an existential threat. That does not mean that China is not a
threat in some areas, but Washington needs to approach this issue based
on the facts, not dangerous rhetoric. Unfortunately, right-sizing the
challenges that China poses seems to be an impossible task for
Washington.]{.underline}

In the most basic, literal sense, an existential threat means a threat
to the physical existence of the nation through the possession of an
ability and intent to exterminate the U.S. population, presumably via
the use of highly lethal nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. A
less conventional understanding of the term posits the radical erosion
or ending of U.S. prosperity and freedoms through economic, political,
ideational, and military pressure, thereby in essence destroying the
basis for the American way of life. Any threats that fall below these
two definitions do not convey what is meant by the word "existential."

[As a military power, China has no ability to destroy the United States
without destroying itself. China's nuclear capabilities are far below
those of the United States, and its conventional military, while
regionally potentially powerful, has a fraction of the budget of that of
the United States.]{.underline}

Some argue that China could militarily push the United States out of
Asia and dominate that region, denying the country air and naval access
and hence support for critical allies. This would presumably have an
existential impact by virtue of the supposedly critical importance of
that region to the stability and prosperity of the United States. Yet
[there are no signs that Washington is losing either the will or the
capacity to remain a major military actor in the region and one closely
connected to major Asian allies, which are themselves opposed to China
dominating the region]{.underline}. In reality, the greater danger in
Asia is that Washington could so militarize its response to China that
its actions and policies become repugnant even to U.S. allies.

This leaves the unconventional threats. Here they are presumably
twofold: economic and technological, and in the realm of ideas and
influence operations within the United States and other Western
countries, including the export of China's so-called "model" of
authoritarian rule to the rest of the world.

The former threats would presumably consist of China attaining a level
of total superiority over both economic and technological levers of
influence globally and with regard to the United States (perhaps
combined with a successful military blocking of U.S. sea lines of
communication) that would so impoverish the country as to threaten its
existence as a stable and prosperous democracy and bring it under
Chinese control. Presumably, the specific basis of such leverage would
consist of near-absolute global Chinese dominance over both trade and
investment relations and supply chains with the United States and other
countries and over all the key technologies driving future growth and
military capabilities.

[It is virtually inconceivable that China could achieve such a level of
dominance over the United States. The United States possesses abundant
energy, human, technological, and other resources; a huge and dynamic
domestic market; enormous levels of accumulated wealth and capital
stocks; and the globe's financial reserve currency.]{.underline}

In contrast, [while China boasts a highly entrepreneurial and dynamic
workforce, it labors under major structural and political constraints
such as insufficient arable land, a rapidly aging society, a heavy
reliance on energy imports, and stifling ideological and state-centered
controls across society.]{.underline}

Beijing has certainly used its economic leverage (such as market access)
to pressure foreign companies and governments to support Chinese
policies or stop what it regards as unacceptable behavior, e.g.,
regarding Taiwan. While such economic coercion is by no means unique to
China, it certainly can erode freedom of speech, thus threatening one of
democracy's core principles. But this hardly rises to the level of an
existential threat to American values, given both the limited reach of
Chinese economic power and the countervailing global economic power and
political influence of democratic states.

[Some observers claim that Beijing could somehow set standards in
critical technology areas and install tech hardware around the world, to
the extent that China would be able to relegate the United States to a
permanently inferior status in both the commercial and military realms,
thus threatening the very existence of the country. This is also highly
unlikely.]{.underline}

Chinese companies are certainly participating in standard-setting in key
areas, including 5G. But this process is highly competitive globally,
and U.S., Asian, and European companies all hold major portions of the
standards and the standard-essential patents that undergird the global
technology ecosystem. [There is little if any chance that Chinese
companies could come to dominate this process. Many tech experts state
that the most likely worst-case outcome of Chinese gains regarding
standards and hardware would be a fragmented technology ecosystem that
would impoverish all countries, not give China a level of power that
would enable it to vanquish the United States.]{.underline}

[More realistically, Beijing might over time exclude high-tech companies
in the United States and other countries from its market, which might
make it difficult for them to continue to grow and innovate. And Chinese
financing power and supply chains could conceivably create a kind of
"turnkey" solution in some developing countries that lock them into a
Chinese tech ecosystem.]{.underline} But such developments would come
nowhere near to constituting an existential threat to the United States,
given the global reach of non-Chinese high-tech companies and the
overall limited reach of any Chinese high-tech ecosystem in the
developing world in the face of such competition.

Finally, the latter set of supposedly existential normative or
ideological threats consists of many elements, including Beijing's
possible overturning of the so-called global liberal international
order, Chinese influence operations aimed at U.S. society, the export of
China's political values and state-directed economic approach, and its
sale of surveillance technologies and other items that facilitate the
rise or strengthening of authoritarian states. These threats all seem
hair-raising at first glance. But while significant, they are greatly
exaggerated and do not rise to the level of constituting an existential
threat.

[Beijing has little interest in exporting its governance system, and
where it does, it is almost entirely directed at developing countries,
not industrial democracies such as the United States. In addition, there
is no evidence to indicate that the Chinese are actually engaged in
compelling or actively persuading countries to follow their
experience.]{.underline} Rather, they want developing nations to study
from and copy China's approach because doing so would help to legitimize
the Chinese system both internationally and more importantly to
Beijing's domestic audience.

In addition, the notion that Beijing is deliberately attempting to
control other countries and make them more authoritarian by entrapping
them in debt and selling them "Big Brother" hardware such as
surveillance systems is unsupported by the facts. Chinese banks show
little desire to extend loans that will fail, and the failures that do
occur are mostly due to poor feasibility studies and the incompetence
and excessive zeal of lenders and/or borrowers. Moreover, in both
loan-giving and surveillance equipment sales, China has shown no
specific preference for nondemocratic over democratic states.

[Even if Beijing were to attempt to export its development approach to
other states, the actual attractiveness of that approach would prove to
be highly limited. The features undergirding China's developmental
success are not replicable for most (if any) countries.]{.underline}
These include a high savings rate; a highly acquisitive and
entrepreneurial cultural environment; a state-owned banking system and
nonconvertible currency; many massive state-owned industries that exist
to provide employment, facilitate party control over key sectors, and
drive huge infrastructure construction; and strong controls over
virtually all information flows. Moreover, such a model (if you can call
it that) is almost certainly not sustainable in its present form, given
China's aging population, extensive corruption, very large levels of
income inequality, inadequate social safety net, and the fact that free
information flows are required to drive global innovation.

Although China's combination of economic reform policies and
authoritarian political system has been around since the early 1980s,
not a single nation has adopted that system either willingly or under
Chinese compulsion. There are certainly many authoritarian states and
fragile democracies on China's periphery, but none of them were made
that way by China.

[China's challenge to the so-called global liberal international order
is also exaggerated.]{.underline} In the first place, it is highly
debatable whether in fact a single coherent global order even exists.
What observers usually refer to as the "liberal international order" (a
relatively recent term) actually consists of an amalgam of disparate
regimes with different origins, including international human rights
pacts, multilateral economic arrangements, and an international court.

[The United States certainly plays an important or leading role in many
of these regimes. But it did not create and does not drive all global
regimes---and in fact does not support some of them, such as the
International Court of Justice, and has not ratified some critical pacts
such as the United National Convention on the Law of the
Sea.]{.underline} And many very important global regimes (e.g.,
regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, trade and
investment, climate change, and pandemics) have no deep connection to
liberal democratic values per se and are supported by Beijing, albeit
sometimes more in letter than in spirit.

[The challenge for the United States is not how to fend off the imagined
existential threats posed by China. Rather, it lies in developing a much
clearer and factually based overall understanding of the limited
challenges, threats, and indeed opportunities China poses to the United
States and the policies needed to address them. Rejecting the specious
notion that China is threatening to destroy an entire way of life will
make this task much easier.]{.underline}

Rigid [alliance structures also magnify the risks of great power
conflict]{.underline}. On the eve of the First World War, Europe was
divided between the "Dual Alliance" of Germany and Austria-Hungary, and
the "Triple Entente" of France, Russia and Great Britain. [It was the
unshakeable nature of each bloc's security commitments that transformed
Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia into a global military conflict.
The only way to avoid future conflagrations is to adopt an attitude of
radical humility. America's leaders must accept that the tectonic shifts
of geopolitical power cannot be reversed, o]{.underline}nly managed so
as to minimise friction. This is more profound than the distinction
between vital and vested interests suggested by Allison. [It requires
the ruling power to fundamentally scale down its ambitions to those of a
great power.]{.underline} The US must cease to aspire to global
hegemony, and instead aim for limited dominance. President Obama had the
foresight to appreciate this. As he explained in his 2015 NSS: "America
leads from a position of strength. But, this does not mean we can or
should attempt to dictate the trajectory of all unfolding events around
the world \[...\] our resources and influence are not infinite".\[13\]
One possible solution could be to return to the fundamentals of
nineteenth-century US grand strategy, the Monroe Doctrine. [Washington's
priority should be to preserve its strategic autonomy in the Western
hemisphere.]{.underline} Consequently, it must continue to safeguard its
security in the Pacific by maintaining its military bases and honouring
its alliance commitments there. 

#### China doesn't pose a threat -- any other ev is constructing its threats. 

**Walt 17**, columnist at Foreign Policy, the Robert and Renée Belfer
professor of international relations at Harvard University, 6-30-2017,
(Stephen, \"Everyone Misunderstands the Reason for the U.S.-China Cold
War,\" Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/30/china-united-states-new-cold-war-foreign-policy/>,
kav)

[The United States is pretty polarized these days, but nearly everyone
seems to agree that China is a big problem.]{.underline} The Trump
administration has been at odds with China on trade issues since day
one, and its 2017 National Security Strategy labeled China a
"revisionist power" and major strategic rival. (President Donald Trump
himself seems to have been willing to give Beijing a free pass if it
would help him get reelected, but that's just a sign of his own venality
and inconsistent with the administration's other policies.) Presumptive
Democratic nominee Joe Biden may have started his campaign in 2019
downplaying fears that China was going to "eat our lunch," but his
campaign has grown increasingly hawkish over time.

Not surprisingly, hard-line Republican members of Congress like Josh
Hawley and Matt Gaetz have been sounding the alarm as well, while
progressives and moderates warn of a "new cold war" and call for renewed
dialogue to manage the relationship. [Despite their differing
prescriptions, all of these groups see the state of Sino-American
relations as of vital importance.]{.underline}

[Unfortunately, discussion of the Sino-American rivalry is also
succumbing to a familiar tendency to attribute conflict to our
opponents' internal characteristics: their ruling ideology, domestic
institutions, or the personalities of particular leaders. This tendency
has a long history in the United States: The country entered World War I
in order to defeat German militarism and make the world safe for
democracy, and later it fought World War II to defeat
fascism.]{.underline} At the dawn of the Cold War, George Kennan's
infamous "X" article ("The Sources of Soviet Conduct") argued that
Moscow had a relentless and internally motivated urge to expand, driven
by the need for foreign enemies to justify the Communist Party's
authoritarian rule. Appeasement would not work, he argued, and the only
choice was to contain the Soviet Union until its internal system
"mellowed." [More recently, U.S. leaders blamed America's problems with
Iraq on Saddam Hussein's recklessly evil ambitions and portrayed Iran's
leaders as irrational religious fanatics whose foreign-policy behavior
is driven solely by ideological beliefs.]{.underline}

In all of these conflicts, [trouble arose from the basic nature of these
adversaries, not from the circumstances they found themselves in or the
inherently competitive nature of international politics
itself.]{.underline}

[And so it is with China today.]{.underline} Former National Security
Advisor H.R. McMaster maintains that China is a threat "because its
leaders are promoting a closed, authoritarian model as an alternative to
democratic governance and free-market economics." Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo agrees: In his view, relations have deteriorated because
"it's a different Chinese Communist Party today than it was 10 years
ago. ... This is a Chinese Communist Party that has come to view itself
as intent upon the destruction of Western ideas, Western democracies,
Western values." According to Sen. Marco Rubio: "Chinese Communist Party
power serves no purpose but to strengthen the party's rule and to spread
its influence around the world. ... China is an untrustworthy partner in
any endeavor whether it's a nation-state project, an industrial
capacity, or financial integration." The only way to avoid a conflict,
Vice President Mike Pence said, is for China's rulers to "change course
and return to the spirit of 'reform and opening' and greater freedom."

[Even far more sophisticated China watchers,]{.underline} such as former
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, attribute much of China's
increasingly assertive stance to President Xi Jinping's centralization
of power, and Rudd sees this behavior as "an expression of Xi Jinping's
personal leadership temperament, which is impatient with the incremental
bureaucratism endemic to the Chinese system, and with which the
international community had become relaxed, comfortable, and thoroughly
accustomed." [The implication is that a different Chinese leader would
be a much less serious problem.]{.underline} Similarly, Timothy Garton
Ash believes that the "primary cause of this new cold war is the turn
taken by the Chinese communist party leadership under Xi Jinping since
2012: more oppressive at home, more aggressive abroad." Other observers
point to rising nationalism (whether spontaneous or
government-sponsored) as another key factor in China's greater
foreign-policy assertiveness.

[Relying on categories originally conceived by the late Kenneth Waltz,
international relations scholars variously refer to such accounts as
"unit-level," "reductionist," or "second-image" explanations. The many
variations within this broad family of theories all view a country's
foreign-policy behavior as primarily the result of its internal
characteristics. Thus, U.S. foreign policy is sometimes attributed to
its democratic system, liberal values, or capitalist economic order,
just as the behavior of other states is said to derive from the nature
of their domestic regime, ruling ideology, "strategic culture," or
leaders' personalities.]{.underline}

[Explanations based on domestic characteristics are appealing in part
because they seem so simple and straightforward: Peace-loving
democracies act that way because they are (supposedly) based on norms of
tolerance; by contrast, aggressors act aggressively because they are
based on domination or coercion or because there are fewer constraints
on what leaders can do]{.underline}.

[Focusing on the internal characteristics of other states is also
tempting because it absolves us of responsibility for conflict and
allows us to pin the blame on others. If we are on the side of the
angels and our own political system is based on sound and just
principles, then when trouble arises, it must be because Bad States or
Bad Leaders are out there doing Bad Things.]{.underline} This
perspective also provides a ready solution: Get rid of those Bad States
or those Bad Leaders! [Demonizing one's opponents is also a time-honored
way of rallying public support in the face of an international
challenge, and that requires highlighting the negative qualities that
are supposedly making one's rivals act as they are.]{.underline}

[Unfortunately, pinning most of the blame for conflict on an opponent's
domestic characteristics is also dangerous. For starters, if conflict is
due primarily to the nature of the opposing regime(s), then the only
long-term solution is to overthrow them. Accommodation, mutual
coexistence, or even extensive cooperation on matters of mutual interest
are for the most part ruled out, with potentially catastrophic
consequences.]{.underline} When rivals see the nature of the other side
as a threat in itself, a struggle to the death becomes the only
alternative.

[In the beginning, Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of
Ukraine appeared to be an ideal rationale for U.S. President Joe Biden's
global democracy campaign.]{.underline} What better endorsement could
there be than the spectacle of a brave, doughty democracy fighting off a
brutal autocrat? As Biden put it in a major speech in Poland in March,
Ukraine was now "on the front lines" in "the perennial struggle for
democracy and freedom." But despite Ukraine's success on the ground
against Putin's military, [the White House's efforts in the months since
to frame the conflict as a titanic worldwide battle between democracy
and autocracy don't appear to be working very well.]{.underline} Outside
of Western European allies and longtime U.S. partners such as Japan,
[much of the rest of the world simply isn't signing on.]{.underline}
Problem one: [Most of these countries either aren't democracies or are
so deeply flawed as democracies that they're less than inspired by the
rhetoric.]{.underline} Problem two: [In the eyes of much of the world,
the country that's doing the preaching---**the U**nited
**S**tates---**is a badly broken democracy** that ought to heal itself
first.]{.underline} These problems were evident at the White House this
week, when Biden welcomed leaders from the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), most of whom are autocrats or represent one-party
states that show no signs of going democratic. Among them: Cambodia's
longtime strongman Hun Sen; Thai Prime Minister Pravuth Chan-ocha, a
former general who seized power in a 2014 coup; and the authoritarian
leaders of Vietnam, Laos, and Brunei. To Biden's relief, the head of
Myanmar's junta, Min Aung Hlaing, another ASEAN member, was not among
them. On Wednesday, Kurt Campbell, Biden's lead White House advisor on
East Asia, acknowledged that the talks would be "maybe a little bit
uncomfortable at times" but did not directly address the issue of
flagging democracy in the region. "I do think we will have a full
exchange and we acknowledge that [there are differences of
view,"]{.underline} he said at a forum at the United States Institute of
Peace. Most of these [countries]{.underline} have indicated they are
[nonaligned in the struggle between Russia and the West]{.underline};
Indonesia, another leading ASEAN member and a democracy, has even
invited Putin to the G-20 summit it is hosting in November. The ASEAN
countries are joined by nations across the Middle East, South Asia,
Latin America, and Africa---[countries]{.underline} that
[include]{.underline} a number of [democracies]{.underline} but also a
quasi-rogue gallery of autocrats and dubious democrats who represent the
majority of the world's population. And [they are not persuaded that
Russia, a major source of oil and gas supplies, needs to be cut off from
the global system.]{.underline} ["Their attitude is, 'Who are you to be
telling us what to do or telling us what our rights are?]{.underline}
People in your country who win the popular vote don't even get elected
president. So don't preach to us!'" said Michael Coppedge, an expert in
democratization at the University of Notre Dame who is one of the
managers of an exhaustive international study by the Varieties of
Democracy (V-Dem) Institute, released last month. According to a report
by Freedom House, "Reversing the Decline of Democracy in the United
States," "\[A\]mid a 16-year decline in global freedom, democracy in the
United States has suffered serious erosion." The report found that the
United States had dropped to level of flawed democracies like Panama,
Romania, and South Korea and concluded, ["The weakening of American
democracy did not start with \[former U.S.\] President \[Donald\]
Trump's direct pressure on democratic institutions and rights, and his
departure from the White House has not ended the crisis."]{.underline}
Critics say that while the Biden administration's framing of the
conflict is working well within NATO and the West---joined by firm U.S.
allies such as Japan and South Korea---[**the U.S. president needs to
rethink his approach if he wants to corral more allies** in his efforts
**to isolate and weaken Russia.**]{.underline} The real issue being
tested, they say, is not democracy per se but rather an issue that most
countries can identify with more readily: the sanctity of their borders
under post-World War II norms upheld by United Nations-sanctioned
international law. ["This is about territorial integrity and non-use of
force to change borders]{.underline}, along with international norms.
Those are the core issues," said Bruce Jentleson, a political scientist
at Duke University and a former senior foreign-policy advisor to former
U.S. Vice President Al Gore and the State Department's Policy Planning
Staff. "In that respect, it's akin to Kuwait 1990," when then-U.S.
President George H.W. Bush won a broad international consensus against
then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. In an email, Jentleson added that
while he has "great admiration" for Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky's wartime leadership, Ukraine itself has long been known to be
a "questionable democracy" and one of the world's most corrupt
countries. Chas Freeman Jr., a former senior U.S. diplomat who helped to
frame George H.W. Bush's "new world order" concept during the 1990-1991
Persian Gulf crisis, agreed with this assessment. And Biden has indeed
condemned Russia's invasion as ​"a flagrant violation of international
law." But Freeman said [the **U**nited **S**tates **would have to work
hard to restore its credibility**]{.underline} on that front [in the
wake of its own more recent violations of international norms, including
the use of torture and the invasion of Iraq. "We need to return to the
basic principles of international law that we foolishly set
aside]{.underline}, but that's going to be a problem," Freeman told
Foreign Policy. "The United States sponsored, created, and enforced what
is now called the liberal international order after World War II. So you
have the U.N. Charter, which lays out the basic principles of
international law. You can't go to war without a justification from the
U.N. Security Council, which we had \[in 1990-91\]. But that was the
last time we observed those norms. After that, **[every principle of
international law that we pioneered, we violated."]{.underline}**
[Returning to those basic principles]{.underline}, with appropriate mea
culpas, [may be the only course forward if the United States is to win
over much of the world]{.underline}, Freeman said. What won't work, he
added, is evangelizing about the glories of democracy---an old American
habit, and one that he believes the Biden team is resorting to for
largely domestic political benefit. "I've thought from the beginning
that frankly this is a load of crap," Freeman said. "It's a very
American conceit. And it's particularly ironic that it should come to
the fore during a period when our own democracy is manifestly in deep
trouble and we're not even sure we're going to have a peaceful
transition in 2024." [Biden's credibility problem extends to other major
nations that have not gone along with Biden's campaign---and which
continue to temporize over the Russian invasion.]{.underline} For India,
the issue has little to do with democracy and everything to do with
border security, said Rani Mullen, a scholar at the College of William &
Mary. Its increasingly autocratic leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
is a populist fanning sectarian hatred between Hindus and Muslims while
on the international stage, he pursues relations with both Moscow and
Washington. Since the beginning of the year, India has dramatically
stepped up its purchases of discounted Russian oil---which Modi
desperately needs to shore up India's weakening economy. Modi's stance
is entirely about realpolitik, said Mullen, an expert in South and
Central Asia. And that means maintaining workable relations with Russia
so as not to encourage a deeper partnership between Moscow and China,
the Indians' most feared potential aggressor along with Pakistan, which
has a cozy relationship with Beijing. For New Delhi, the most paramount
issue is border integrity under the 1954 Panchsheel Agreement (which the
Chinese call the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence") between
India and China. "Ultimately, India's stance is driven by thinking that
alienating Russia will undermine its security," Mullen said. "Democracy?
What does it care? That's the reality of it. It's all about China. So
framing Russian actions in a way that would guarantee mutual respect for
each other's territorial integrity---that would strike a different
chord." More broadly, the stark fact Biden must confront is that
**[democracy has been in retreat since the Cold War.]{.underline}** "The
level of democracy enjoyed by the average global citizen in 2021 is down
to 1989 levels. The last 30 years of democratic advances are now
eradicated," a report by the V-Dem Institute said. "Dictatorships are on
the rise and harbor 70% of the world population---5.4 billion people."
The study found that liberal democracies can now be found in only 34
nations, down from its peak of 42 in 2012, which are home to only 13
percent of the world's population. A key fence-sitter in this global
struggle over international norms is authoritarian China, which has
sought to find a middle ground between Russia and the West. Chinese
President Xi Jinping is sticking by his partnership with Putin, yet
Beijing has mostly observed economic sanctions against Russia. Chinese
officials say their country is loath to choose sides, but Washington has
made that difficult by portraying the conflict as one that is primarily
about Western-style democracy rather than global norms. As Robert
Manning, a former U.S. intelligence official and senior fellow at the
Atlantic Council, wrote in Foreign Policy this week: "The logic of
'democracies only' could lead to a bifurcated or maybe trifurcated
world." China covets Taiwan much as Russia does Ukraine, but even
Washington still officially embraces its long-time "one China" policy,
acknowledging that Taiwan is part of a single China. Beijing is angry
that this diplomatic mainstay is also fraying, with Biden's State
Department removing such language from its official guidance website,
which no longer states that Washington "does not support Taiwan
independence." Nor has the Biden administration offered up any new
initiatives to wean Beijing away from Moscow. Other major nations, even
those that are democratic, also are making calculations based on factors
that have little to do with the threat to democracy. Brazilian President
Jair Bolsonaro recently said he would continue to support Russia's
participation at international forums, such as the G-20, the
International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. Some experts say the
inconsistencies in Biden's approach to democracy have hurt him as well.
The president's virtual democracy summit at the end of last year was
widely criticized for the seemingly arbitrary way some countries were
invited while others were snubbed. The Philippines' anti-U.S. president,
Rodrigo Duterte, was welcomed for example despite his violent campaign
of extrajudicial executions, whereas Washington-aligned Singapore, which
was rated "partly free" in Freedom House's annual study of rights and
liberties worldwide, was excluded. Singapore's Freedom House ranking was
also higher than some other invitees, such as Angola, Iraq, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Lebanon. In the
Philippines, Duterte will soon be replaced by Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the
son and namesake of the country's long-time dictator, who has said he
wants to draw closer to Beijing. "Countries that are not democratic are
being treated as democratic. It's completely a fool's errand," said
Raffaello Pantucci, a visiting senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School
of International Studies in Singapore. "It alienates people on the
ground." Yet for all that, [Ukraine]{.underline} is also not Kuwait
circa 1990-1991: a state ruled by monarchs. It [is]{.underline}
genuinely [a democracy in peril.]{.underline} And Biden appears unready
to compromise on an agenda that he has embraced since the beginning of
his presidency, when he declared in his first State of the Union address
that "In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are
rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of
peace and security." Biden administration officials like to point to the
economic weight of the United States and its Western allies, which make
up "50 percent-plus of global GDP" while "China and Russia are less than
20 percent," as U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in
February.

#### American attempts to expand hegemony through Ukraine prompts Russian retaliation -- that exacerbates conflicts and leads to nuclear war

THE WAR in Ukraine is the most dangerous international conflict since
the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Understanding its root causes is
essential if we are to prevent it from getting worse and, instead, to
find a way to bring it to a close. There is no question that Vladimir
Putin started the war and is responsible for how it is being waged. But
why he did so is another matter. The mainstream view in the West is that
he is an irrational, out-of-touch aggressor bent on creating a greater
Russia in the mould of the former Soviet Union. Thus, he alone bears
full responsibility for the Ukraine crisis. But that story is wrong.
[The West, and especially America, is principally responsible for the
crisis]{.underline} which began in February 2014. It has now turned into
a war [that not only threatens to destroy Ukraine, but also has the
potential to escalate into a nuclear war between Russia and
NATO.]{.underline} The trouble over Ukraine actually started at NATO's
Bucharest summit in April 2008, when George W. Bush's administration
pushed the alliance to announce that Ukraine and Georgia "will become
members". Russian leaders responded immediately with outrage,
characterising this decision as an existential threat to Russia and
vowing to thwart it. According to a respected Russian journalist, Mr
Putin "flew into a rage" and warned that "if Ukraine joins NATO, it will
do so without Crimea and the eastern regions. It will simply fall
apart." [America ignored Moscow's red line, however, and pushed forward
to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia's border. That strategy
included two other elements: bringing Ukraine closer to the eu and
making it a pro-American democracy.]{.underline} These efforts
eventually sparked hostilities in February 2014, after an uprising
(which was supported by America) caused Ukraine's pro-Russian president,
Viktor Yanukovych, to flee the country. In response, Russia took Crimea
from Ukraine and helped fuel a civil war that broke out in the Donbas
region of eastern Ukraine. The next major confrontation came in December
2021 and led directly to the current war. [The main cause was that
Ukraine was becoming a de facto member of NATO. The process started in
December 2017, when the Trump administration decided to sell Kyiv
"defensive weapons". What counts as "defensive" is hardly clear-cut,
however, and these weapons certainly looked offensive to Moscow and its
allies in the Donbas region. Other NATO countries got in on the act,
shipping weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}, training its armed forces and
allowing it to participate in joint air and naval exercises. In July
2021, Ukraine and America co-hosted a major naval exercise in the Black
Sea region involving navies from 32 countries. Operation Sea Breeze
almost provoked Russia to fire at a British naval destroyer that
deliberately entered what Russia considers its territorial waters. The
links between Ukraine and America continued growing under the Biden
administration. This commitment is reflected throughout an important
document---the "us-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership"---that was
signed in November by Antony Blinken, America's secretary of state, and
Dmytro Kuleba, his Ukrainian counterpart. The aim was to "underscore ...
a commitment to Ukraine's implementation of the deep and comprehensive
reforms necessary for full integration into European and Euro-Atlantic
institutions." The document explicitly builds on "the commitments made
to strengthen the Ukraine-u.s. strategic partnership by Presidents
Zelensky and Biden," and also emphasises that the two countries will be
guided by the "2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration." Unsurprisingly,
[Moscow found this evolving situation intolerable and began mobilising
its army on Ukraine's border last spring to signal its resolve to
Washington. But it had no effect, as the Biden administration continued
to move closer to Ukraine.]{.underline} This led Russia to precipitate a
full-blown diplomatic stand-off in December. As Sergey Lavrov, Russia's
foreign minister, put it: "We reached our boiling point." Russia
demanded a written guarantee that Ukraine would never become a part of
NATO and that the alliance remove the military assets it had deployed in
eastern Europe since 1997. The subsequent negotiations failed, as Mr
Blinken made clear: "There is no change. There will be no change." A
month later Mr Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine to eliminate the
threat he saw from NATO. This interpretation of events is at odds with
the prevailing mantra in the West, which portrays NATO expansion as
irrelevant to the Ukraine crisis, blaming instead Mr Putin's
expansionist goals. According to a recent NATO document sent to Russian
leaders, "NATO is a defensive Alliance and poses no threat to Russia."
The available evidence contradicts these claims. For starters, the issue
at hand is not what Western leaders say NATO's purpose or intentions
are; it is how Moscow sees NATO's actions. Mr Putin surely knows that
the costs of conquering and occupying large amounts of territory in
eastern Europe would be prohibitive for Russia. As he once put it,
"Whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart. Whoever wants it
back has no brain." His beliefs about the tight bonds between Russia and
Ukraine notwithstanding, trying to take back all of Ukraine would be
like trying to swallow a porcupine. Furthermore, Russian
policymakers---including Mr Putin---have said hardly anything about
conquering new territory to recreate the Soviet Union or build a greater
Russia. Rather, since the 2008 Bucharest summit Russian leaders have
repeatedly said that [they view Ukraine joining NATO as an existential
threat that must be prevented.]{.underline} As Mr Lavrov noted in
January, "the key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not
expand eastward." Tellingly, Western leaders rarely described Russia as
a military threat to Europe before 2014. As America's former ambassador
to Moscow Michael McFaul notes, Mr Putin's seizure of Crimea was not
planned for long; it was an impulsive move in response to the coup that
overthrew Ukraine's pro-Russian leader. In fact, until then, NATO
expansion was aimed at turning all of Europe into a giant zone of peace,
not containing a dangerous Russia. Once the crisis started, however,
[American and European policymakers could not admit they had provoked it
by trying to integrate Ukraine into the West. They declared the real
source of the problem was Russia's revanchism and its desire to dominate
if not conquer Ukraine.]{.underline} My story about the conflict's
causes should not be controversial, given that many prominent American
foreign-policy experts have warned against NATO expansion since the late
1990s. America's secretary of defence at the time of the Bucharest
summit, Robert Gates, recognised that "trying to bring Georgia and
Ukraine into NATO was truly overreaching". Indeed, at that summit, both
the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Nicolas
Sarkozy, were opposed to moving forward on NATO membership for Ukraine
because they feared it would infuriate Russia. The upshot of my
interpretation is that [we are in an extremely dangerous situation, and
Western policy is exacerbating these risks. For Russia's leaders, what
happens in Ukraine has little to do with their imperial ambitions being
thwarted; it is about dealing with what they regard as a direct threat
to Russia's future.]{.underline} Mr Putin may have misjudged Russia's
military capabilities, the effectiveness of the Ukrainian resistance and
the scope and speed of the Western response, but [one should never
underestimate how ruthless great powers can be when they believe they
are in dire straits. America and its allies, however, are doubling down,
hoping to inflict a humiliating defeat on Mr Putin and to maybe even
trigger his removal. They are increasing aid to Ukraine while using
economic sanctions to inflict massive punishment on Russia, a step that
Putin now sees as "akin to a declaration of war".]{.underline} America
and its allies may be able to prevent a Russian victory in Ukraine, but
the country will be gravely damaged, if not dismembered. Moreover,
t[here is a serious threat of escalation beyond Ukraine, not to mention
the danger of nuclear war. If the West not only thwarts Moscow on
Ukraine's battlefields, but also does serious, lasting damage to
Russia's economy, it is in effect pushing a great power to the brink. Mr
Putin might then turn to nuclear weapons.]{.underline} At this point it
is impossible to know the terms on which this conflict will be settled.
But, if we do not understand its deep cause, [we will be unable to end
it before Ukraine is wrecked and NATO ends up in a war with
Russia.]{.underline}

Pax Americana vs. inclusive security While Washington warms to the idea
of an inclusive security dialogue, circumstances in the region remain
problematic. Though the conditions and norms necessary to make a
security arrangement successful and durable are largely missing, most of
these cannot be expected to exist prior to constructing this
architecture. Instead, they will come into existence through the
deliberations that establish the new security arrangement. For instance,
norms such as noninterference in other states' internal affairs, or a
taboo against the pursuit of regime-change in neighboring countries, are
notoriously weak in the Middle East. Similarly, virtually all major
powers in the region engage in funding and supporting armed nonstate
actors in other countries, though few as extensively and successfully as
Iran. The strengthening of norms of noninterference cannot constitute
preconditions for the pursuit of a new security architecture. Instead,
the adoption and strengthening of these norms should be on the agenda,
together with mechanisms to regulate and limit military buildups and
expenditures, as the security arrangement is negotiated. Such an arms
control component of the agreement would have to address ballistic
missile programs as well as the use of paramilitary groups. Other
necessary changes in the conduct of Persian Gulf states do not pertain
to particular activities but rather to the very conception of security
and the principles for ordering the region. A common perspective in
Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates is to divide the region between Arab
and non--Arab states. Statements critical of Iran and Turkey often focus
on their alleged interference in Arab affairs. "The Turkish interference
in the internal affairs of Arab countries is a clear example of negative
interference in the region," the UAE's foreign minister, Anwar Gargash,
recently charged.\[17\] The Saudi foreign minister, Ibrahim al--Assaf,
and other Saudi officials regularly make similar charges about Iran.
"One of the most dangerous forms of terrorism and extremism is what Iran
practices through its blatant interference in Arab affairs," al--Assaf
told the Arab League in 2019.\[18\] The emphasis on Arab affairs may
appear benign but has profound implications. It suggests that Saudi
Arabia --- which kidnapped, Saad al--Hariri, the Lebanese prime
minister, in 2017, has contributed in Yemen to what the United Nations
considers the world's worst humanitarian disaster, intervened militarily
in Bahrain to crack down on dissidents, and was on the verge of invading
Qatar to overthrow its government --- can engage in these activities
legitimately by virtue of its ethnic Arab makeup.\[19\] At the same
time, Turkey and Iran are, by definition, rendered illegitimate actors
by virtue of their non--Arab composition. (Going forward, Riyadh may
have to make an exception for Israel, which otherwise would fall into
the same category as Turkey and Iran.) Under this mindset, a shared
history, cultural ties, borders, and trade do not provide avenues for
influence (positive or negative) --- only the ethnic identity of the
state does. While such a racist division of the region may serve Saudi
Arabia's bid for regional leadership by disqualifying its non--Arab
rivals by default, the refusal to recognize the legitimacy of other
states based on ethnicity is not conducive to the creation of an
inclusive security arrangement. Iran's refusal to recognize Israel
presents a similar dilemma. These conceptions add to a reluctance among
some Persian Gulf states to support an inclusive security architecture
for the region. For many of these states, the continuation of Pax
Americana offers a far more attractive option: The United States tips
the regional balance in their favor, affords them a security umbrella,
contains and weakens their regional rivals, obviates any need for
compromise with their regional foes --- and, all the while, hands the
bill to the American taxpayer. In the words of Robert Gates, the former
U.S. defense secretary, the Saudis want to "fight the Iranians to the
last American."\[20\] Binding the United States to their own security
and political ambitions has, as a result, been imperative. These states
watch with trepidation the shifting of political winds in Washington
away from the United States acting as a world policeman and sustaining
an infrastructure of more than 800 military bases and facilities
worldwide. "Bringing the troops home" is equivalent to a call to abandon
America's Persian Gulf security partners, in their view. Their harsh
reactions to any sign or measure that could conceivably weaken
Washington's commitment to their security and ambitions are revealing.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE (along with Israel) viewed the 2015 Iran
nuclear accord, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, less as an arms
control agreement and more as a measure that would allow the United
States to pivot to Asia and cease its three-decades-old role as a
counterbalance to Iranian power. American officials were baffled to hear
some Arab officials view the agreement as a first step toward abandoning
the Sunni states of the Persian Gulf in favor of a renewed U.S.--Iran
alliance, akin to what existed during the time of the shah. After all,
the agreement would end Iran's political and economic isolation and
terminate Washington's policy of containing Iran, all the while
facilitating an American military withdrawal from the Persian Gulf. The
details of the nuclear agreement were not their primary concern. In the
words of Michael Morell, acting director of the Central Intelligence
Agency under President Obama: "If I was going to put my finger on the
single most important factor that explains the largest number of actions
that are taking place in the region today, it is the widespread
perception of American withdrawal."\[21\] These Saudi, Emirati, and
Israeli fears have not been limited to the presidency of Barack Obama,
under whose watch the JCPOA was negotiated and concluded. President
Trump, who took American deference toward these autocratic regimes to
new levels, further intensified nervousness in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi
about America's commitment to their security. Two events in the summer
and fall of 2019 confirmed their fears. [Recognizing that the U.S.
military was no longer at their disposal, Saudi Arabia and the UAE began
exercising diplomatic options they had earlier shunned.]{.underline}
After a tense summer with mysterious attacks against oil tankers in the
Persian Gulf, most likely at the hand of Iran, Tehran shot down an
American spy plane it claimed had entered its airspace. At first, Trump
approved retaliatory strikes against targets in Iran, but he reversed
his order at the last moment and instead directed a cyberattack against
Iran. The reversal stunned the world as well as America's security
partners in the region. John Bolton, the hawkish U.S. national security
advisor and ardent supporter of war with Iran, was devastated by Trump's
decision.\[22\] Three months later, a spectacular drone attack against
Saudi refineries in Abqaiq and Khurais, in the eastern part of the
country, disrupted more than half of Saudi Arabia's oil production for
several weeks. Though a U.N. investigation could not confirm Iran's
involvement in the attack, Saudi officials had no doubt about the
culprit's identity. They expected the United States to come to their
defense.\[23\] Once again, [Trump showed little interest in starting a
war with Iran on behalf of the Saudis, causing Middle East officials and
much of the Washington foreign policy establishment alike to accuse him
of having abandoned the Carter Doctrine.]{.underline}\[24\] [Rather than
the Middle East descending into chao]{.underline}s, as proponents of Pax
Americana had predicted, [Persian Gulf states began exploring regional
diplomacy.]{.underline}\[25\] Recognizing that the U.S. military was no
longer at their disposal, Saudi Arabia and the UAE began exercising
diplomatic options they had earlier shunned. [Saudi officials quietly
reached out to Iran via intermediaries seeking ways to ease tensions.
Tehran, in turn, floated a peace plan based on a mutual Iranian--Saudi
pledge of nonaggression.]{.underline} Riyadh also stepped up direct
talks with Houthi rebels in Yemen to ease tensions with their backer,
Iran.\[26\] Abu Dhabi went even further. [The UAE started withdrawing
troops from Yemen and opened direct talks with Tehran over maritime
security.]{.underline} [It even released \$700 million in funds to
Iran]{.underline} in contradiction to the Trump administration's maximum
pressure strategy.\[27\] While the calculation behind these measures
might have been tactical, it is nevertheless noteworthy that as the
United States showed military restraint, its erstwhile allies tilted
toward diplomacy. The Saudis and Emiratis simply had no choice but to
reverse their rejection of diplomacy because they could no longer
presume they operated under the protection of the United States. With
the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020,
however, the pendulum once again swung in the direction of confrontation
and away from diplomacy, courtesy of American military intervention.
These developments suggest that Saudi and Emirati opposition to an
inclusive regional dialogue can be allayed. As long as the United States
remains committed to intervening in the region militarily, Riyadh and
Abu Dhabi tend to prefer an aggressive posture intended to direct U.S.
power toward weakening and defeating Ira[n. Once Washington convincingly
demonstrates its disinclination to get involved in an armed
confrontation with Tehran, the Saudis and Emiratis adjust accordingly
and begin exploring diplomacy to secure their interests through more
peaceful coexistence with their northern rival.]{.underline}
Consequently, openness to and readiness for an inclusive security
architecture is likely to emerge only when the United States clearly has
abandoned all ambitions to dominate the Persian Gulf. Sullivan and
Benaim recognize this as well and view it as an opportunity. The
realization that the Americans are "not going to be our saviors" is
compelling Saudi Arabia and the UAE to take regional diplomacy much more
seriously and "to take matters into their own hands to a more
significant degree," according to Sullivan.\[28\] [As long as the United
States remains committed to intervening in the region militarily, Riyadh
and Abu Dhabi tend to prefer an aggressive posture intended to direct
U.S. power toward weakening and defeating Iran]{.underline}. The recent
normalization agreement between Israel and the UAE is best understood in
this context --- as a counter to this trend. It is not so much a peace
deal as it is an arms deal --- and an implicit defense pact. The UAE
gets access to the United States' most advanced fighter jet, the F--35,
in return for normalizing relations with Israel while further binding
the United States to Abu Dhabi's security. Arab states in the Gulf
Cooperation Council have long treated American weaponry purchases as
informal defense arrangements that oblige the United States to protect
them militarily. Of course, positioning the Emirati--Israeli accord as
an anti--Iran move also reinforces America's status-quo military
commitment to the Middle East. The notion that the threat from Iran is
so overwhelming that it compelled the UAE to strike a deal with Israel
is belied by the fact that Abu Dhabi is far more embroiled in countering
Ankara's regional ambitions and Turkish support for the Muslim
Brotherhood, which the Emiratis define as their primary political
enemy.\[29\] Iran, in turn, poses a different set of challenges. Its
official rhetoric calls for the United States to exit the region
altogether. A security architecture should be created and sustained by
the Persian Gulf alone, Tehran maintains. To the other states in the
Persian Gulf, this is a nonstarter for the same reason Tehran finds it
preferable: With the United States removed from the Persian Gulf, the
path will open for Iran to become the dominant power in these waters (as
it was during the time of the shah). However, given the Persian Gulf's
importance in the global economy, [Tehran has little choice but to
accept a role for outside powers in any inclusive security
architecture.]{.underline} Getting to this point may prove less arduous
than Iran's official statements suggest. Senior Iranian officials
privately concede that the architecture will have dim chances of success
without the support and approval of the United States and possibly other
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. However, the proposition
has not been tested, since a serious effort at creating an inclusive
security arrangement has yet to be undertaken. A truly inclusive
security architecture Given the will to move forward, the vital issues
that Persian Gulf states would initially need to agree on are whether to
build on existing organizations and structures or set up an entirely new
institution. They would also have to determine the organization's scope,
ambition, and, finally, its membership. Starting with humble ambitions
limited to kickstarting diplomacy without any formal structures, as
Sullivan and Benaim suggest, may be wise in the interim. But in the
longer term, [diplomatic activity needs to be
institutionalized.]{.underline} The diplomacy deficit in the Persian
Gulf region is notorious. Except for the Gulf Cooperation Council, there
are no multinational security organizations. But building upon the GCC
may be unwise, if this is even possible, as it suffers from numerous
flaws. It was conceived as a defense pact against Iraq and Iran rather
than an inclusive organization with a cooperation-oriented mission and
purpose. Its raison d'être has been premised primarily on the existence
of an external threat that member states unite against. Moreover, it is
paralyzed by internal conflicts, mainly the standoff between Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, and their partners on the one hand, and Qatar on the
other. Though the blockade against Qatar imposed in mid--2017 has been
lifted, the underlying causes of their dispute remain unresolved. [A new
security architecture has a better chance of succeeding if it instead is
inspired by successful, security-enhancing institutions in other
regions, such as the O]{.underline}rganisation for
[S]{.underline}ecurity and [C]{.underline}ooperation in
[E]{.underline}urope [or]{.underline} the [A]{.underline}ssociation of
[S]{.underline}outh[e]{.underline}ast [A]{.underline}sian
[N]{.underline}ations. Though these are vastly different organizations,
they are inclusive and cooperation-oriented rather than premised on the
need to balance a common threat. Moreover, by sidestepping the GCC, the
new initiative will also evade much of its divisive baggage. In terms of
scope and purpose, ASEAN's more soft-security focus --- disaster-relief
cooperation and humanitarian assistance --- might be an easier lift
initially for the Persian Gulf states but is likely to prove
insufficient in the long run. Equally, the OSCE's all-encompassing
approach --- from confidence-building measures to human rights promotion
to hard security issues --- may be too ambitious at first. Still, it
should be the organization's long-term objective to promote cooperation
on all such issues. Combating drug trafficking and pandemics,
environmental issues, maritime security, and pilgrimage-security
agreements are all challenges on which collaboration may be relatively
forthcoming. Eventually, however, the region's hard security challenges
must be addressed: defense expenditures, weapons acquisition, foreign
bases, limits on ballistic missiles, and the use and arming of militias,
to name a few such questions. The composition of the new security
organization is another crucial issue. For the [Persian Gulf states to
have a sense of ownership, which is essential to the success of any such
endeavor, they have to lead it themselves rather than rely on the United
States or other major powers to drive it.]{.underline} However,
curtailing Washington's instinct to always lead and control diplomatic
mechanisms will be challenging. Simultaneously, without buy-in and
support from major powers, regional powers will likely prove unable to
negotiate the new security architecture successfully. Including the
United States risks pushing Iran to opt out; not including the United
States will compel most GCC monarchies to disengage. This new approach
would not mean disengaging from the Persian Gulf but would instead
prioritize diplomatic and economic involvement over military hegemony,
military interventions, and arms sales. The solution may lie in
expanding external involvement beyond the United States. One option
would be to provide observer status to all permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, the P5. This approach would anchor the security
architecture in the international system's existing structures and
likely reduce objections and hesitation from all sides. Sullivan and
Benaim have signaled openness to this idea.\[30\] Another option would
be to anchor it in a combination of the P5, some EU member states in the
form of "lead groups," and the Asian powers with the most significant
stake in Persian Gulf security due to their dependence on its energy
supplies. On the one hand, coordination on the Iran nuclear file between
the EU's foreign policy institutions (e.g., the European External Action
Service) and the so-called E3 --- France, Germany, and the United
Kingdom --- could represent a form of European involvement in and
contribution to the new security organization. On the other hand, India,
Japan, and South Korea (in addition to China) are the most significant
importers of Persian Gulf gas and oil. Their own tensions and rivalries
risk turning the Persian Gulf into an arena for their geopolitical
competition in coming decades. Including them in the security
architecture can help strengthen the arrangement and dilute the
influence of the U.S. and China while protecting the region from
inter--Asian geopolitical rivalries in the future.

"Everybody who has touched the Middle East has gotten bogged down."
Candidate Donald Trump rightly pointed this out in October 2015 as he
laid out his vision for a foreign policy that would end America's
forever wars and extract America from its Mideast quagmires. Trump not
only tapped into public anger toward Washington's indifference to the
American people's pain and suffering, but he also pointed to America's
indisputable interest in ending misguided foreign adventures and refocus
on domestic needs. President Trump, however, speaks of leaving the
region while doing precious little about it. Nowhere has his policy
contradicted his promise to get out of the Middle East more than his
maximum pressure strategy on Iran. "Our brave troops have now been
fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years," Trump complained in
his State of the Union address in February 2019. \"In Afghanistan and
Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than
52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than \$7
trillion in the Middle East\... As a candidate for President, I pledged
a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.\" On this,
Trump is right. The United States has spent trillions of dollars
maintaining military dominance in the Middle East while often fighting
other countries' wars for them. It has done so in the name of
establishing stability in the region and security for America. Neither
of those objectives has been achieved. [U.S. interventions in the Middle
East have destabilized the region while incentivizing U.S. allies to
forego regional diplomacy]{.underline} and instead spend lobbying
dollars in Washington to convince the United States to fight their wars
for them. In the meantime, the trillions of dollars spent on weapons
systems have left the American people naked and vulnerable to far more
likely non-military threats such as COVID-19. Mindful of the dwindling
importance of Middle East oil to the U.S. and the U.S.'s lack of
resources and expertise to "fix" dysfunctional states in that region,
[the cost-benefit analysis of retaining military hegemony in the Middle
East no longer makes sense]{.underline}. As Trump correctly quipped last
year, "Let someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand." As a
Presidential candidate, Trump often pointed to the alternative cost of
America's Middle East wars. \"We\'ve spent \$4 trillion trying to topple
various people that, frankly, if they were there and if we could have
spent that \$4 trillion in the United States to fix our roads, our
bridges, and all of the other problems --- our airports and all the
other problems we have --- we would have been a lot better off," Trump
argued back in 2015. The American public - and Trump's base in
particular - continue to share these views. A survey of Trump voter
attitudes by The Tarrance Group last month revealed that 86% of his base
support pulling out of Syria while 58% want troops to leave Iraq as
well. An overwhelming majority (66%) prefer diplomacy with Iran, and
only 25% favor war with the country. This is why Trump\'s policy on Iran
is so baffling. True, Trump has not ended any of the endless wars thus
far. His agreement with the Taliban will likely only bring down U.S.
troop levels to Trump's own pre-surge levels. In Iraq, the government
asked the U.S. to leave, and instead of treating it as an opportunity to
bring the troops home, Trump rejected the request and even threatened to
sanction Iraq. [On Iran, however, Trump has not only failed to end
confrontational policies - he has actively pursued a path that has put
the U.S. on the verge of a new war in the Middle East]{.underline}. [The
policy of maximum pressure has inflicted massive pain on the Iranian
economy]{.underline} - its GDP had contracted more than 15% even before
the COVID pandemic. Yet, three years after reimposing sanctions, Trump
has not only failed to achieve a single one of his objectives, in most
cases[, Tehran has intensified the very policies Washington has sought
to change. Maximum pressure has not compelled Iran to end uranium
enrichment. Instead, Iran has expanded its nuclear activities. It has
not ended its ballistic missile program, rather, Tehran has continued
and intensified its ballistic missile testing as well as its support for
allied groups in Iraq, Palestine, Lebanon, and Yeme]{.underline}n. [Nor
did the assassination of]{.underline} General Qassem [Soleimani,
arguably Iran's most important military commander, "deter Iran from
conducting or supporting further attacks against United States forces
and interests." In the past few weeks, we have seen more attacks against
U.S. troops in Iraq, including several deaths,]{.underline} prompting
Trump to issue a threat of war over Twitter on April 1, 2020. Not
surprising, the logical conclusion of economic warfare is military
warfare. Rather than securing Iran's capitulation, maximum pressure has
drawn the U.S. closer to yet another war in a region Trump had promised
to leave. None of this is to deny that [Iran positions itself as an
enemy of the United States, that it has targetted U.S. troops, or that
it is entangled in a rivalry with the United States for influence in the
Middle East.]{.underline} But so are the Taliban. And for the sake of
the higher goal of extracting the U.S. from Mideast quagmires, Trump
rightfully moved to bury the hatchet with the Taliban in order to bring
U.S. servicemen and women home. On Iran, Trump has done the opposite
even though discarding the reckless rivalry with Tehran is a critical
step towards withdrawing from the Middle East. Indeed, why engage in a
rivalry for the control of a region you don't want to control -
particularly when the accusations of Iran seeking hegemony in the Middle
East are questionable at best and advanced by the very same U.S.
"allies" who have their own beef with Tehran and need the U.S. to be
entrapped in the region so that it will be forced to fight the Iranians.
As former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates said, the Saudis want to fight
the Iranians till the last American. Reality is that all of Trump's
promises to free America from its Mideast misadventures will come to
naught if he continues his economic warfare against Iran. He can either
leave the region or have war with Iran. He can't have both.

**[The negative economic consequences of America's ambitious foreign
policy objectives were echoed by prominent voices]{.underline}**
(Calleo, 1982; Kennedy, 1987). **[Providing a stable and secure
environment was seen as]{.underline}** especially **[damaging to the
hegemonic power because it allowed others to divert resources to
economically profitable activities.]{.underline}** The financial
implications of security commitments formed the backbone of Kennedy's
"military overstretch" hypothesis (Kennedy, 1987). [**Kennedy posited
negative feedback between hegemonic commitments and the economy**.
Specifically, he argued that the military spending required to finance
security guarantees drains the economy and reduces the resource base to
fund overseas engagements in a downward spiral, putting hegemony at
risk.]{.underline} Security scholars started worrying about the
"Lippmann gap"---the political stalemate resulting from the difference
between America's increasingly broad commitments and its means to
fulfill those commitments (Lippmann, 1943). Perspectives on whether U.S.
security undertakings entail economic burdens that undermine long-term
economic prospects, and eventually U.S. hegemony, figure prominently in
the debate. In discussions of U.S. grand strategy, authors argue that
the **[military spending needed to finance America's security
engagements is economically debilitating, thus driving debt and
decline]{.underline}** (Drezner, 2013; Gholz, Press, & Sapolsky, 1997;
Layne, 1997, 2002; MacDonald & Parent, 2011; Pape, 2009; Posen, 2007;
Posen & Ross, 1996; Schweller, 2014; Walt, 2005, 2011; Williams, 2016).
This near consensus view has produced massive support for a diminished
U.S. role, with a minority questioning the theory and evidence informing
a reorientation of U.S. hegemony (Brooks, Ikenberry, & Wohlforth, 2013;
Brooks & Wohlforth, 2016; Norrlof & Wohlforth, 2016; Nye, 1995).

#### Focusing on hegemony diverts attention away from the economy

relations at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. Before

For one thing, I think the [popular impression of America as the world's
economic hegemon is overstated.]{.underline} Yes, the United States has
many economic advantages. Its domestic market is still the destination
of choice for manufacturing exports. It has the world's reserve currency
(which means it enjoys the "exorbitant privilege" of running crazy
deficits). It has veto rights at the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund (which it shouldn't have, but that's a separate argument).
And it has unique control over the "pipes" of the international
financial system.

But in Asia --- the world's wealthiest and most populous region ---
China established economic centrality years ago. America's economic
throw-weight in Asia is far less than China's, in part because of trade
volume, but also because America's large investments in Asia are not
state-backed or centrally coordinated, which makes them somewhat
un-leverageable. And US exclusion from Asia's dense financial
architecture makes it likely that things will continue trending in that
direction. [That means what's going on is the economic equivalent of
"uni-multipolarity" or "multi-multipolarity"]{.underline} --- system
level hegemony, perhaps, but regional level contested hierarchy for
sure.

Nevertheless, pointing out that the [United States isn't as dominant as
we think d]{.underline}oesn't answer the why-no-strategy question. It
might be that the [United States has a habit of **overemphasizing the
military as a tool of policy**, which has **diminished policymakers'
ability to think seriously** **about** connections between security and
**political economy**]{.underline}. As somebody who was a maker of
strategy in the Obama era, I think there's something to this.

Since World War II, **[the U.S. dollar has become the world\'s
unchallenged reserve currency.]{.underline}** The monetary functions
literally [affords the U.S. the ability to print and spend as much money
as it wants without repercussions]{.underline}. If a state wants to
\"cash in\" its U.S. dollar dominated financial assets (i.e. the U.S.
Treasury), all America has to do is print the Treasury\'s face value. In
short, **[U.S. dollar hegemony is the source of American
hegemony]{.underline}**, because money is power, affording [America the
ability to build as many weapons as it wants and buy influence around
the world.]{.underline} With an \"endless\" supply of money, the U.S.
could likewise enjoy \"unlimited\" power over other countries.

However, the **[U.S. has been misusing]{.underline}**, if not abusing
the privilege, using **[it to build a formidable military force in
enforcing in maintaining American supremacy]{.underline}**. Any nation
-- Iran, the DPRK, China and Russia, etc. -- seen as a threat to its
global hegemony would be threatened with military force or sanctions.

**[Taking away the source power would erode America\'s ability to
interfere in other countries\' internal affairs and benefit the
world.]{.underline}**

Why ending U.S. dollar dominance would benefit the world

First, **[not relying on the U.S. dollar could promote global economic
growth in that international trade and investment will likely
increase]{.underline}**. Not having to exchange local currencies for the
greenback would [reduce transactional costs and exchange rate risks,
necessary conditions for promoting trade and investment]{.underline}.
Should a country wishing to trade with China, for example, it could set
up a currency swap of using each other\'s currency to settle the
transactions.

Since 2009, [**China has reached currency swap agreements with many
countries**, including U.S. allies such as South Korea, Canada, the UK,
etc.]{.underline} The latest is with Japan, with both countries agreeing
to a nearly 30 billion U.S. dollars swap presumably for the purpose of
increasing trade between the two countries. The number would likely
increase because of China\'s fast-expanding trade relationship with
countries participating in its Belt and Road Initiative.

Nations that are threatened by U.S. sanctions should particularly be
pleased with the erosion in the importance of the greenback. Iran, for
example, could see its oil export rise by reaching an agreement with
buyers using each other\'s currency or some other mutually acceptable
medium of exchange.

Second, **[declining importance of the U.S. dollar would expand and
strengthen the multinational financial system.]{.underline}** At
present, the vast majority of **[foreign loans are made by the
U.S.-controlled IMF and WB]{.underline}**. The U.S. has **[imposed harsh
loan conditions]{.underline}** on countries borrowing from the two
multinational financial institutions.

Perhaps [the harshest condition is loans must be repaid before the
borrowing nations can spend the funds on economic and social
development]{.underline}, the very reason why developing nations need to
borrow in the first place. Since most, if not all, of the developing
nations do not have the means to boost economic growth and revenue,
**[the condition keeps borrowing nations underdeveloped,]{.underline}**
and increases their debt burden, forcing the borrowing nations to ask
for another loan just to repay the previous one like in Sri Lanka,
Pakistan and other countries.

In many ways, **[harsh U.S. loan conditions]{.underline}**, in part,
have **[forced increasing number of developing countries to look to
China]{.underline}** and its backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
(AIIB) for loans, thereby increasing the utilization of the yuan and
less use of the greenback. One reason would be that neither imposes
preconditions, perhaps with the exception of financial viability or
ability of borrowers\' ability to service the debt.

The growing importance of China and the AIIB as alternative sources of
funding might be a reason why the U.S.-controlled institutions are
working closely with the AIIB in funding infrastructure projects. The
**[cooperative stance]{.underline}** **[could lead to the expanding and
strengthening of the world financial system]{.underline}**

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Conflict 

#### **U.S. heg fuels unnecessary conflict by creating tensions with and intimidating other nations**

**Kelly 19** \[6 Aug 2019, Kelly, Robert E., Robert E Kelly is a
professor of international relations in the Department of Political
Science and Diplomacy at Pusan National University., "US foreign policy:
restraint without retrenchment", The Interpreter,
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/us-foreign-policy-restraint-without-retrenchment\]//AA

[US foreign policy]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War [has come
under growing criticism for its expansive, even aggressive,
character.]{.underline} Despite its name, [**"liberal hegemony" often
seems illiberal, belligerent, even militaristic.** The US has used force
regularly over the last 30 years, often with dubious
results.]{.underline} Iraq 2003 is the most obvious example, but
Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and (through its Saudi proxy) Yemen also
spring to mind. The current US President Donald Trump has also
threatened force against North Korea, Venezuela, and Iran. In response
to these excesses, [a clutch of realist critics have argued variously
for restraint or retrenchment]{.underline} -- Barry Posen, Daniel
Larison, and Stephen Walt immediately spring to mind. I found this
H-Diplo review of Walt's recent book nicely summarises the issues at
hand. The primary argument is that [the United States does far too much
overseas]{.underline}, especially when it does not need to. [The US
faces no existential threats.]{.underline} Its geography -- its distance
from the contentious theatres of Eurasia -- is generous. [It is the
wealthiest country in the world]{.underline}, with an unmatched
military. Before the First World War, it restricted itself mostly to the
Western hemisphere. [Its expansion in the 20th century was driven by
threats emanating from Eurasia, first fascism, then
communism.]{.underline} [Yet since the "end of history" and the
dissipation of those threats in 1989, there has been no
pull-back.]{.underline} Instead, [the US has been ever more sucked into
places around the world. **This expansion produces unnecessary tension
with China, Russia, and the Islamic world.**]{.underline} Worse, [the US
now fights more often than it did during the Cold War.]{.underline}
These interventions often take far longer than the public is led to
expect. **[They kill far more people and cost far more money than
admitted.]{.underline}** At home, a massive national security state has
emerged, confirming President Dwight Eisenhower's famous warning of the
"military-industrial complex". US military interventions have often
taken far longer than the public is led to expect (Photo: US Central
Command/Flickr) The policy response to this sprawl is some mix of
retrenchment and restraint. [A US grand strategy of "offshore balancing"
would husband American resources at home. Intervention would only occur
when facing a genuine hegemonic challenger]{.underline} -- most
obviously China. But [the "small wars" which have characterised US
intervention in recent decades would stop]{.underline}, for we now know
that they do not stay small. Diplomacy would be properly funded; US
foreign policy would be de-militarised. Multilateralism and
international organisations would be given a chance where the US today
disdains them. From an American point of view, it is hard to argue with
a lot of this. [The country is pretty clearly exhausted with "forever
wars"]{.underline} such as Afghanistan or Iraq. Trump openly ran against
"dumb wars" in America's traditionally hawkish party and still won
easily. [That is a powerful signal for change from the
public.]{.underline} It is also hard to see wars with Iran, Venezeula,
or North Korea staying "regional contingencies", because as with other
US ground conflicts, they would almost certainly explode in size and
duration. Similarly, it is hard to argue against US allies doing more.
US presidents have complained for decades about allied free-, or more
accurately cheap-, riding. Trump has unfortunately tarnished this
concern with his otherwise reprehensible conduct, but **[the notion of a
more balanced, less hegemonic American alliance network is rather
appealing.]{.underline}** [So restraint -- fewer wars, less
"omni-directional belligerence", more diplomacy -- is not too
controversial.]{.underline} I imagine [most US allies would actually
like this, too.]{.underline} Many US partners were dismayed at getting
chain-ganged into the Iraq war, for example, agreeing to it only to
retain US friendship. Similarly, Trump was nearly alone in pushing for
war with North Korea in 2017. Donald Trump openly ran against "dumb
wars" (Photo: US Central Command/Flickr) It is important to distinguish
this restraint from retrenchment though, which I do not think this
literature does well. [Restraint ultimately means better US
judgment]{.underline} -- less paranoia, less worst-case-scenario
thinking, less willingness to describe every unfriendly government or
far-off region as "strategic" to the US, less activism and jumpiness. No
one disagrees with greater US perspicacity, except perhaps America's
most irresponsible partners such as the Saudi royals or Israel's Likud
party. Give a child a hammer, and everything is an upraised nail --
[give a superpower a massive military and global basing, and threats
become an easy recourse.]{.underline} Retrenchment is more than this
though. It is actual withdrawal of US forces back to the Western
hemisphere from forward bases in Eurasia, specifically from Europe, the
Persian Gulf, and East Asia. Given China's rise however, retrenchment
would like fall on Europe and the Middle East first. Europe, most
observers would agree, has the wealth and state strength to do far more
for its own security, while US policing of the Middle East is simply
beyond even its superpower reach. Restrainers' argument for retrenchment
is temptation. It is formally possible, as I am arguing, that [US forces
could stay forward]{.underline} -- that is, in Eurasia -- [without
fighting more unnecessary wars.]{.underline} But as long as they are
there, as long as there are US forces near countries such as Iran, North
Korea, and Venezuela, it will be hugely tempting for US policy-makers to
militarily threaten those states. This is akin to the "law of the
hammer" -- give a child a hammer, and everything is an upraised nail.
Give a superpower a massive military and global basing, and threats
become an easy recourse. [A full-blooded restraint argument would claim
greater US foreign policy discipline is possible only when the US is
physically out of the way.]{.underline} I[deally though, the US could
stay where it was wanted]{.underline} -- eastern Europe, Australia,
South Korea, Japan -- [without actually leaping therefrom into
wars.]{.underline} The advantages of staying forward are clear. [US
presence bolsters alliances. It helps solidify liberal
democracy]{.underline} in places which might otherwise backslide. It
builds democratic solidarity around the world among otherwise disparate
states to push back concertedly on authoritarians such as Russia or
China. [It builds interoperability]{.underline} with local partners
should future military needs arise and gives the US a location from
which to operate should local geopolitics worsen. [Even a small US
presence can reinforce positive trends]{.underline}, such as
democratisation or the deterrence of Sino-Russian meddling, without,
hopefully, being large enough to invoke the law of the hammer. And [the
financial assistance from allies could offset the cost of US forward
stationing.]{.underline} In South Korea and Japan, the US, Japanese, and
South Korean governments frequently repeat that is actually cheaper to
keep US forces there than bring them home. [Allied support]{.underline},
plus the costs to the US to build new facilities back in the US,
[offsets the expense]{.underline} -- although hard data to substantiate
these claims is not forthcoming. Eastern Europe is an obvious example.
US retrenchment from Europe would almost certainly encourage more
Russian meddling from Vladimir Putin and worsen democratic backsliding
in those new democracies. Those would be moral and strategic costs to
the United States. In response, could the US keep a small local presence
that both provides the "reinforcement effects" described above without
so much combat power as to encourage unnecessary war-making? Can we have
restraint without full-blown retrenchment? Or would even small US
presences encourage so much allied free-riding or intervention
temptation that they are not worth it? ["Places not bases", in which the
US retains "lily pads" for possible operations in the future without
large contingents of men and material, are one possibility]{.underline}
to square this circle.

#### Only hegemonic restraint can prevent conflict -- its key to alliances

[Liberal internationalism as a grand strategic paradigm has created a
resistance to--- or perhaps more bluntly, a rejection of---a realist
balance of power thinking]{.underline}. As such, [the advancement of a
liberal international order has led to discrepancies between American
power and the resources available to it. The 'shining city upon a hill'
finds itself increasingly overstretched through its involvement in
endless Middle Eastern wars, its self-proclaimed duty to promote
democracy abroad, the reality of a resurgent Russia and China, and
global democratic relapsing, all in the face of domestic turmoil at
home]{.underline}. A strategy of liberal internationalism has resulted
in a costly foreign policy approach in which freedom and liberty have
become the linchpin of American creed. Rallying against this
conventional wisdom, Trump's 'America First' strategy aimed to repudiate
some of the core tenets of liberal internationalism and implicitly
rejected the United States' role as 'world policeman'. His
administration confronted American allies as 'free-riders', entered
negotiations with adversaries without preconditions and showed hostility
towards free trade and international cooperation. This is not to say
Trump had a coherent or effective foreign policy, or that he completely
abandoned the use of military force and steered away from a goal of
regime change---quite the opposite---but his condemnation of the narrow
Washington consensus provided a unique opportunity for American policy
elites to question the underlying logic of its traditional trajectory.
Nevertheless, President Joe Biden has committed not only to rebuilding
America, but also to "building back better". While the new
administration is likely to pursue a rigorous restoration of American
exceptionalism and liberal internationalism, [a return to the pre-Trump
status quo ante is not likely to improve US foreign policy in a way that
is able to effectively address the contemporary challenges it faces
today.]{.underline} The prevailing path-dependencies that exist around
the forward leaning military posture in which the United States must
attempt to tackle tyranny all over the world is one of the biggest
problems in American foreign policy. [The alliance structures and force
postures of the bygone Cold War era are incompatible with emerging
shifts in the global balance of power.]{.underline} The Biden
administration must steer away from the inclination to conflate global
leadership with military force and it must refrain from intervening in
the internal affairs of others to its own detriment. America no longer
enjoys unfettered unipolar primacy and can therefore no longer rely on
business-as-usual policies that are ill-suited to the complexities of
the 21st century. [It is precisely the preponderant power of the United
States that has accelerated the process of its own relative decline
whereby excessive military adventurism has resulted in an inability to
distinguish between vital national security interests and those things
that America can live without. By seeking to restore American primacy,
President Biden is likely to miss the opportunity to build a more
constructive, less militarised foreign policy that is better suited to
the world America finds itself in today]{.underline}. Where America must
go from here After four years of Trumpism, if the Biden administration
wants to successfully begin the task of self-restoration at home, it
should practice restraint abroad. The United States is not in danger of
conquest; thus, US territorial integrity is secure. As such, a grand
strategy of restraint would force policy elites to rethink its
assessment of the national interest based on the reality that presents
itself as opposed to being founded upon idealistic ambition. Broadly,
[restraint seeks to revise existing alliance structures and to encourage
responsibility among them in order to shift regional defence burdens
away from the United States. It emphasizes the danger of threat
inflation, reduces existing US defence commitments and minimizes the
forward-deployment of troops along with the frequent use of
force]{.underline}. In particular, [it would see a reduction of
investment in the Middle East and a careful withdrawal of troops; a
shifting of defence burdens to allies in Europe as a result of reduced
US commitments in the region and an end to NATO expansion; and the
maintenance of a stable balance of power in Asia, namely achieved
through alliance commitments.]{.underline} Restraint drives home the
point that the United States is not here to come to the rescue as has
often been assumed---it must rely on regional actors to maintain
regional balances of power and intervene only when American national
interest is at stake, using military force as a very last resort. [The
results of such a grand strategy would see global tensions eased, direct
threats to American personnel reduced, the burden on US forces in
regions of peripheral interest lessened, progress on areas of mutual
concern come to fruition, and, perhaps most importantly, it will allow
the new administration to more effectively combat the coronavirus
pandemic and allow for a degree of economic recovery.]{.underline}
Supporters of liberal hegemony wrongly conflate a grand strategy of
restraint with isolationist tendencies which is, in part, why it has
existed on the margins of an acceptable elite opinion. But restraint in
no way advocates that the United States should retrench entirely from
the global stage---military power still remains central to US national
security---it merely suggests that America has the ability and
opportunity to preserve its security at a lesser cost than that of
liberal internationalism. Restoring the foreign policy toolkit to focus
on creative diplomacy, international institutions and cooperative
engagement to deal with collective threats should be coupled with a
demilitarisation of US foreign policy. Such a strategy requires a
self-control that recognises not everything and anything is in the
interest of the United States[. Overall, a grand strategy of restraint
would reject the need for global hegemony and refute the idea that a
safe world is only one that is remade in America's image]{.underline}

Far from contributing to American security, the [plan of global military
superiority has made America --- and Americans --- less
safe.]{.underline} 

I have a great deal of sympathy for the architects of US military
dominance. I think they faced difficult circumstances. How could I not
sympathize with wanting to rid the Axis powers from the Earth and make
sure nothing like that happened again? I have complete sympathy with
that goal. 

But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the reason that brought
forth US global supremacy has ceased to exist. [There was an original
argument for the United States shouldering the immense burdens of global
military dominance:]{.underline} Without it, totalitarian powers would
conquer much of the Earth. That would be terrible for the world, the
thinking went, and it could be bad for the United States. 

The [problem, though, is the pursuit of military dominance since then
has created a lot of enemies of the US that didn't need to be enemies of
the US.]{.underline} We've engaged in bad behavior ourselves and
stimulated it in others. 

I worry that [--- in a world where the foremost threats to the American
people are pandemic disease and climate change --- America will continue
to define its biggest threats in military terms, even if they
aren't.]{.underline}

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) --- [Iran's new president slammed U.S.
sanctions imposed on his nation as a mechanism of war]{.underline},
using his first U.N address since his swearing-in to forcefully [call
out Washington's policies in the region and the growing political schism
within America.]{.underline}

President Ebrahim Raisi on Tuesday delivered a far more critical and
blunt take on American foreign policy than his moderate predecessor,
Hassan Rouhani, had done in previous speeches to the U.N. General
Assembly. Raisi, who was sworn in last month after an election, is a
conservative cleric and former judiciary chief seen as close to Iran's
Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

His speech espoused Iran's Islamic political identity and where the
Shiite-led nation sees its place in the world, despite crushing U.S.
sanctions that have hurt its economy and ordinary Iranians.

"[Sanctions are the U.S.' new way of war with the nations of the
world]{.underline}," Raisi said, adding that such economic punishment
during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic amounts to "crimes against
humanity."

[U.S. sanctions, while allowing for humanitarian aid, have made
international purchases of medicine and equipment much more difficult.
Iran has endured multiple waves of the coronavirus, with nearly 118,000
deaths recorded --- the highest in the region.]{.underline}

In taking aim at the United States, Raisi also referenced the shocking
Jan. 6th insurrection on Capitol Hill by supporters of then-President
Donald Trump, and the horrific scenes at Kabul airport last month as
desperate Afghans plunged to their deaths after clinging to a U.S.
aircraft evacuating people.

"[From the Capitol to Kabul, one clear message was sent to the world:
the U.S.' hegemonic system has no credibility, whether inside or outside
the country]{.underline}," Raisi said.

[The Iranian president said "the project of imposing Westernized
identity" had failed, and added erroneously that "today, the U.S. does
not get to exit Iraq and Afghanistan but is expelled."]{.underline}

[The U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan amid a hasty and chaotic
airlift of more than 100,000 Afghans and foreigners, and has largely
withdrawn from Iraq. Iran shares long borders with Afghanistan to its
east and Iraq to its west, where Shiite militias are
powerful.]{.underline}

The perseverance of nations, he said, is stronger than the power of
superpowers. In a dig at the political slogans used by Trump and his
successor President Joe Biden, Raisi said: "Today, the world doesn't
care about "America First" or "America is Back."

Speaking remotely via video from Tehran, Raisi wore a black turban on
his head that identifies him in the Shiite tradition as a direct
descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. He praised Iran's Islamic Revolution
of 1979 as the fulfilment of "religious democracy" and linked the growth
of "indigenous terrorism in the West" to a decline in spirituality.

Despite the criticism aimed at Washington, [Raisi appeared not to rule
out a return to the negotiating table for the nuclear accord, saying
Iran considers talks useful if their ultimate outcome is the lifting of
all sanctions.]{.underline} Still, he stated: "We don't trust the
promises made by the U.S. government."

A senior U.S. State Department official said Washington had taken note
of Raisi's speech but was looking to Iran for actions, rather than
rhetoric.

In that context, the official said [the U.S. also noted an Iranian
foreign ministry statement earlier Tuesday that said Iran is willing to
return to the indirect nuclear talks in Vienna in the coming
weeks.]{.underline}

"We continue to believe that we need to re-engage in the Vienna context
as soon as possible," said the official, who was not authorized to
publicly discuss the matter and spoke to reporters on condition of
anonymity.

Tensions peaked last year between the U.S. and Iran after the Trump
administration's assassination of powerful field commander, Qassim
Soleimani, and a top Iraqi Shiite militia leader by a U.S. drone strike
in Iraq. Raisi mentioned the men in his speech, saying they helped fight
Sunni extremists of the Islamic State Group from "becoming neighbors of
Europe".

[Biden has made clear he wants to salvage the nuclear deal with Iran
that Trump withdrew the U.S. from, but indirect talks between Washington
and Tehran in Vienna have stalled as tensions in the Persian Gulf
persist.]{.underline} The Biden administration and allies like Israel
and Gulf Arab states also want to see Iran's missile development and
support for regional militias addressed.

"[The United States remains committed to preventing Iran from gaining a
nuclear weapon]{.underline}," Biden said in his own U.N. speech,
delivered in person earlier Tuesday.

When asked about Iran, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told
reporters aboard Air Force One that "[the door remains open to
diplomacy]{.underline}" and that U.S. negotiators believe the best path
forward is to pursue talks, but she had no update on when the parties
might meet again.

Raisi insisted that [atomic weapons have no place in Iran's defense
doctrine and deterrence policy.]{.underline}

[The early successes of the United States and its allies in building a
liberal international order notwithstanding, the order contained the
seeds of its own ruin. Even if Western policymakers had been wiser
stewards of that order, they could not have extended its longevity in
any meaningful way]{.underline}. It was doomed to fail because it
contained three fatal flaws. [First, **intervening in the politics of
countries to turn them into liberal democracies is extremely
difficult**, **and** attempting such ambitious social engineering on a
global scale **is virtually guaranteed to backfire and undermine the
legitimacy of the enterprise itself**. Nationalism is almost certain to
cause significant resistance inside the countries targeted for regime
change]{.underline}. Balance of power politics will also help impede the
enterprise in particular cases. [**States that fear** regime change---or
other **forms of U.S. interference**---**will band togethe**r for mutual
support and seek **ways to thwart the United States' liberal
agenda**]{.underline}. Thus, Syria and Iran aided the Iraqi insurgency
after the 2003 U.S. invasion, and Russia and China have backed each
other economically, militarily, and within international forums such as
the UN Security Council. [Second, the liberal international order
ultimately creates conditions that lead to serious political problems
regarding sovereignty and national identity within the liberal
democracies themselves]{.underline}, and [all the more so when efforts
at regime change fail and produce large-scale refugee flows into liberal
countries]{.underline}. Again, the principal cause of the problem is
nationalism, which is far from dead even in avowedly liberal societies.
[Third**, hyperglobalization has produced significant economic costs**
for large numbers of people inside the liberal democracies, including
the sole pole. Those costs, **including lost jobs, declining** or
stagnant **wages, and** marked **income inequality, have** serious
**domestic political consequences, which** further **undermine the
l**iberal **i**nternational **o**rder.]{.underline} Moreover, the open
international economy helped fuel the rise of China, which, along with
Russia's revival, eventually undermined unipolarity, an essential
condition for creating a liberal international order.

The attempt by the United States and its allies to create a [liberal
international order]{.underline} faced [three main
problems]{.underline}. First[, it required the **liberal states** in the
system]{.underline}, especially the United States, [to **pursue** a
highly **revisionist** and wildly ambitious **policy** of regime
**change** **that was** almost **certain to fail in an era** **in which
nationalism**]{.underline}, with its emphasis on sovereignty and
selfdetermination, **[remains a]{.underline}** remarkably **[powerful
force]{.underline}**. The policy was also stymied by balance of power
politics at both the global and regional levels. Second, by pushing for
the free movement of people across borders and [the delegation of
substantial decisionmaking authority to international institutions, the
expanding liberal order caused significant political problems inside the
liberal states themselves]{.underline}. The results often clashed with
beliefs about national identity and sovereignty, which matter greatly to
most citizens in modern nation-states. Third, although some people and
countries benefited from [**hyperglobalization**, it ultimately caused
major economic and political problems inside the liberal democracies,
which **eventually led to a serious erosion of support for the liberal
international order.**]{.underline} At the same time, the economic
dynamism that comes with hyperglobalization helped China rapidly turn
itself into a great power at roughly the same time Russia was
reestablishing itself as a great power. That [shift in the global
balance of power put an end to unipolarity, which is a prerequisite for
a liberal world order]{.underline}. In the emerging multipolar world,
there is likely to be a realist international order that will be
concerned with managing the world economy and also fostering and
maintaining arms control agreements. The emphasis in that order will be
on facilitating interstate cooperation. In addition, there are likely to
be Chinese-led and U.S.-led bounded orders that will help prosecute the
security competition that is almost certain to arise between China and
its allies, on the one hand, and the United States and its allies, on
the other. That rivalry will have both economic and military dimensions.

[**Liberal internationalism** promised to promote democracy and
strengthen a "rules based international order" with other countries.
Rather than turning inwards, it **envisioned** an active role for **the
West, as a champion of human rights abroad**.]{.underline} But its
signature projects, military intervention and nation-building, have
failed in Afghanistan, just as they did in Syria and Libya. [As a
painful demonstration of the limits of American military might, liberal
internationalism's collapse has accelerated the decline of Washington's
global power too.]{.underline} What went wrong? [At its heart, **liberal
internationalism suffered from a democratic deficit**.]{.underline} It
was a product of what the political scientist Stephen Walt has called
"the blob", the bipartisan foreign policy elite that dominated
policymaking during the Cold War and beyond. But "the blob" forgot that
power-projection overseas depended ultimately on the willingness of
Americans to fight and pay for it[. **American domestic support**, never
robust anyway, **drained away** as body counts mounted in Afghanistan
and the "forever war" blundered on without end.]{.underline} When
divorced from the pursuit of vital American security interests, which
might have carried the backing of the electorate, **[liberal
internationalism degenerated]{.underline}** into boutique virtue
signaling[,]{.underline} social work in places we understood poorly and
had no essential reason to be in, anyway. [Alongside its lack of
domestic support, li**beral internationalism suffered from** a fatal
case of "mission creep"---**the tendency to expand objectives beyond
their initial parameters**]{.underline}. If the U.S. had limited its
aims in Afghanistan to countering the terrorist threat and had withdrawn
when the threat had been contained, military operations there would have
served American vital interests and maintained sufficient domestic
support. Instead[, the U.S. and its allies let themselves be drawn into
an objective---a stable and democratic Afghanistan---which was never
realizable. Both **the U.S. military** and the international civil
society that flooded in to "rebuild" Afghanistan failed]{.underline} to
grasp the political canniness of their Taliban foe or [confront
the]{.underline} inveterate [corruption of their Afghan political
friends. American aid **agencies and NGOs raised the hopes of their
Afghan partners**, and **then**, once the game was up, the **United
States abandoned them all.**]{.underline} In the bleak clarity of
hindsight, nation building in Afghanistan was worse than a mistake. It
was a side-show. The main strategic challenge was China. Instead of
developing a long-term strategy to deal with its first serious
competitor since the end of the Cold War, America wasted time, money and
lives on a peripheral enterprise that could only end in failure.

Agnostic orders also tend to have substantial staying power, because the
unipole accepts the heterogeneity that is inherent in political and
social life and does not try to micromanage the politics of nearly every
country on the planet. That kind of pragmatic behavior helps preserve,
if not augment, the hegemon's power. An agnostic order is likely to meet
its end when unipolarity gives way to either bipolarity or
multipolarity, making the order realist; or if the sole pole experiences
a revolution at home and adopts a universalistic ideology, which would
surely lead it to forge an ideological order. By contrast, any
ideological international order based on a universalistic ideology, such
as **[liberalism]{.underline}** or communism, [**is destined to have a
short life span**,]{.underline} mainly [because of the domestic and
global difficulties that arise **when the unipole seeks to remake the
world in its own image**. Nationalism and balance of power politics work
to undermine the requisite social engineering in countries targeted for
regime change]{.underline}, while nationalism also creates significant
problems on the home front for the sole pole and its ideological allies.
[**When** such **problems emerge, the unipole is likely to give up
trying to remake the world in its own image, in effect abandoning its
efforts to export its ideology abroad**. It might **even** **forsake
that ideology altogether.** When that happens, the order stops being
ideological and becomes agnostic.]{.underline} An ideological order can
also come to an end in a second way. [**New great powers could emerge,
which would undermine unipolarity** and lead to either a bipolar or a
multipolar system]{.underline}. In that event, the ideological order
would be replaced by bounded and international realist orders.

The most important requirement for building a liberal international
order is to spread liberal democracy far and wide, which was initially
seen to be an eminently feasible task. It was widely believed in the
West that politics had evolved to the point where there was no sensible
alternative to liberal democracy. If so, then it would be relatively
easy to create a liberal international order, because spreading liberal
democracy around the world would meet little resistance. Indeed, most
people would welcome the idea of living in a Western-style democracy, as
appeared to be the case in Eastern Europe after the collapse of
communism. This endeavor, however, was doomed from the start. [To begin,
**there** never has been and **never will be universal agreement on**
what constitutes **the ideal political system**.]{.underline} One can
argue that liberal democracy is the best form of government (I would),
but others will invariably favor a different governing system. It is
worth remembering that [during the 1930s, many people in Europe
preferred communism or fascism to liberal democracy.]{.underline} One
might then point out that liberal democracy ultimately triumphed over
those two "isms." Although that is true[, the history of the 1930s is a
reminder that liberal democracy is not the preordained order of things,
and it is not unusual for elites and their publics to opt for
alternative political systems.]{.underline} Thus, it should not be
surprising that illiberal democracies are appearing in Eastern Europe,
while China and Russia have embraced authoritarian rule, North Korea is
a dictatorship, Iran is an Islamic republic, and Israel increasingly
privileges its Jewish identity over its democratic character.51 Nor
should it be surprising that there has never been a time when more than
50 percent of the countries in the world were liberal democracies.52
[This diversity of opinion about what constitutes the best governing
system combines with nationalism to make the process of spreading
liberal democracy around the world extremely difficult]{.underline}.
Nationalism, after all, is a remarkably powerful political force that
places great emphasis on self-determination and sovereignty.
[**Nation-states**, in other words, do not want other nation-states
telling them how they should order their political system. Thus,
**trying to impose liberal democracy** on a state that prefers an
alternative form of government **is almost certain to provoke fierce
resistance**.]{.underline}

In recent years, however, [the **liberal order has** **begun** **to**
weaken and **fracture at the core**]{.underline}. As a result of many
related factors---difficult economic conditions, the recrudescence of
nationalism and tribalism, weak and uncertain political leadership and
unresponsive mainstream political parties, a new era of communications
that seems to strengthen rather than weaken tribalism---there has
emerged a crisis of confidence in what might be called the liberal
enlightenment project. That project tended to elevate universal
principles of individual rights and common humanity over ethnic, racial,
religious, national, or tribal differences. It looked to a growing
economic interdependence to create common interests across boundaries
and the establishment of international institutions to smooth
differences and facilitate cooperation among nations. Instead, the past
decade has seen the rise of tribalism and nationalism; an increasing
focus on the "other" in all societies; and a loss of confidence in
government, in the capitalist system, and in democracy. We have been
witnessing something like the opposite of the "end of history" but have
returned to history with a vengeance, rediscovering all the darker
aspects of the human soul. That includes, for many, the perennial human
yearning for a strong leader to provide firm guidance in a time of
seeming breakdown and incoherence. **[This crisis of the enlightenment
project may have been inevitable]{.underline}**. It may indeed have been
cyclical, due to inherent flaws in both capitalism and democracy, which
periodically have been exposed and have raised doubts about both---as
happened, for instance, throughout the West in the 1930s. Now, as then,
moreover, this crisis of confidence in liberalism coincides with a
breakdown of the strategic order[. In this case, however, the key
variable has not been the United States as the outside power and its
willingness, or not, to step in and save or remake an order lost by
other powers. Rather it is **the U**nited **S**tate**s'** own
**willingness to continue upholding the order that it created** and
which depends entirely on American power. That willingness has been **in
doubt for some time.** Increasingly in the quarter-century after the end
of the Cold War, **Americans have been wondering why they bear such an
unusual and outsized responsibility for preserving global order when
their own interests are not always apparently served and** when, indeed,
**the U**nited **S**tates **seems to be making sacrifices while others
benefit**.]{.underline} The reasons why the United States took on this
abnormal role after the calamitous two world wars of the 20th century
have been largely forgotten. As a consequence[, the **American public's
patience with the difficulties and costs inherent in playing such a role
has worn th**]{.underline}**in**. Thus, whereas previous unsuccessful
wars, in Korea in 1950 and Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s, and previous
economic downturns, such as in the mid- to late 1970s, did not have the
effect of turning Americans against global involvement, the unsuccessful
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the financial crisis of 2007--09 have
had that effect. President Obama pursued an ambivalent approach to
global involvement, but the main thrust of his approach was
retrenchment. His actions and statements were a critique of previous
American strategy and reinforced a national mood favoring a much less
active role in the world and much narrower definition of American
interests. [With the election of Donald Trump, a majority **of Americans
have signaled their unwillingness to** continue **uphold**ing **the
world order**]{.underline}. Trump was not the only candidate in 2016 to
run on a platform suggesting a much narrower definition of American
interests and a lessening of the burdens of American global leadership.
"America First" is not just an empty phrase but a fairly coherent
philosophy with a long lineage and many adherents in the American
academy[. It calls for viewing American interests through a narrow lens.
It suggests no longer supporting an international alliance structure, no
longer seeking to deny great powers their spheres of influence and
regional hegemony, no longer attempting to uphold liberal norms in the
international system, and no longer sacrificing short-term
interests---in trade for instance---in the longer-term interest of
preserving an open economic order.]{.underline}

The 2007--08 global financial crisis not only did enormous damage to
many peoples' lives, but it also called into question the competence of
the elites who manage the liberal international order.47 In addition to
the deterioration in relations between Russia and the West, there are
worrying signs of potential conflict with China, which is determined to
change the status quo regarding the East China Sea, the South China Sea,
Taiwan, and the China-India border. Unsurprisingly[, the United States
is now more interested in containing rather than engaging
China.]{.underline} In fact, the Trump administration recently said that
admitting China into the WTO was a mistake, as Beijing's protectionist
policies clearly show that it is unwilling to play by that institution's
rules.48 Finally, [the number of liberal democracies has been declining

[Finally, **the crusader mentality** that underpins the attempts to
build a liberal international order **leads to the poisoning of
relations** between the unipole and any major power in the system that
is not a liberal democracy]{.underline}. Although the dominant state
will be strongly inclined to make war on minor powers to promote liberal
democracy, it will rarely ever attack major powers for that purpose,
especially if they possess nuclear weapons.56 The costs would be too
great, and the likelihood of success would be especially low. Hence,
U.S. policymakers in the post--Cold War period have never seriously
considered invading China or Russia, even though the United States is
far more powerful than either of those countries. Nevertheless[, th**e
United States has been committed to turning China and Russia into
liberal democracies and absorbing them into the U.S.-dominated liberal
world order**]{.underline}**.** [U.S. leaders have]{.underline} not only
made their intentions clear, but they have also relied on
nongovernmental organizations and [various subtle strategies to push
Beijing and Moscow toward embracing liberal democracy]{.underline}. In
effect, the aim is peaceful regime change. Predictably, [**China and
Russia have resisted** the unipole's **efforts** for the same reason
that minor powers have contested U.S. efforts to shape their domestic
politics]{.underline}, and indeed for the same reason that Americans now
recoil at the idea of Russia interfering in their country's politics. In
a world in which nationalism is the most powerful political ideology,
self-determination and sovereignty matter hugely for all countries.
[China and Russia have also resisted the spread of the liberal order for
realist reasons, **because it would allow the United States to dominate
the international system economically, militarily, and
politically**.]{.underline} Neither Beijing nor Moscow, for example,
wants U.S. military forces in its neighborhood, much less on its
borders. Thus, it is hardly surprising that China talks about pushing
the U.S. military out of the Western Pacific and that Russia has long
been deeply opposed to EU and NATO expansion into Eastern Europe.
Indeed, moving those institutions toward Russia eventually led to the
Ukraine crisis in 2014. [That **ongoing conflict has not only poisoned
relations between Russia and the West, but** it has **incentivized
Moscow to find ways to weaken** both **the EU and NATO**]{.underline}.
In short, [both nationalist and realist calculations caused the two
major powers in unipolarity to contest the unipole's efforts to build a
robust liberal international order.]{.underline}

## AT: Transition

### AT: Collapse = War

**US heg collapse doesn't cause war** -- power disparities and a shared
contentment regarding status quo contentment between the US and other
major powers such as China prove

**Paudel 20** \[September 3, 2020, Paudel, Sirish, Sirish Paudel is
currently studying B. Sc. CSIT (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
and Information Technology) at New Summit College., "Decline in US
Hegemony: Will this Result in Hegemonic War or not?", Modern Diplomacy,

One of the contemporary issues in international relations is that [the
current hegemon, the United States, has undergone a relative
decline.]{.underline} It is argued that American hegemony that emerged
aftermath the Second World War is undergoing a decline and with the rise
of a potential challenger in China looming, one major issue concerning
IR scholars is whether or not the relative decline of US hegemony will
result in a hegemonic war. [Hegemonic wars occur when a rising
challenger]{.underline} -- revisionist power -- isn't content with the
current international order and wants to change it so as to [become a
preponderant force and dictate terms of a new world order.]{.underline}
This article assumes that [although the US is in a relative decline it
is still a dominant power and the rising power is content with the
current status quo so no war occurs between the dominant and the rising
power.]{.underline} In order to support the argument that a hegemonic
war does not occur, this article provides explanation using several
theoretical perspectives. Structural Realism and Balance of Power To
begin with, prominent neorealist Kenneth Waltz contends that [the end of
the Cold War has changed the structure of international
politics]{.underline} from bipolar to unipolar with the US being the
dominant power. According to Waltz, days of US being unipolar force in
world politics is numbered and slowly the world is moving towards
bipolarity or multipolarity because changes in the structure of
international system brings about changes in state behavior. It does not
matter how much self-restraint and self-control a preponderant power is
in its conduct of international relations; states are always wary and
fear the dominant power and thus he maintains that balancing is
universal. \[1\] In order to explain why, he has resorted to the Balance
of Power (theory). In most basic sense, international politics is a
state of anarchy where there is no central government and [states rely
on themselves to protect their autonomy and perpetuate their
survival.]{.underline} Balance of Power contends that states involve in
a balancing act to check the powers of preponderant force so that no any
single state has enough power to become a global hegemon. \[2\] [With
the relative decline of US, China and America can enter into bipolar
relationship]{.underline} much like the US and the USSR during the Cold
War. Since [Waltz]{.underline} himself [posits bipolarity as the most
stable of international configurations]{.underline}, it can be argued
that [act of balancing between the US and China brings the international
distribution of power into an equilibrium and averts the risk of
war.]{.underline} Socialization of Hegemonic Power Most scholars posit
that hegemons use threats and rewards to get compliance from secondary
states. Contrary to popular wisdom, scholars Ikenberry and Kupchan have
contended that in addition to material power, hegemons also have the
power of socialization to achieve compliance from secondary states. They
call this the socialization process which involves 'altering of the
belief systems' of elites. Basically, hegemons project their vision of
international order through normative principles (norms and values) and
not by material incentives; elites in secondary states internalize them,
and devise policies that are compatible to the hegemon's ideal of the
international order. The authors contend that [the world order thus
created can sustain even when hegemon undergoes a decline because the
world order created is relatively inexpensive to maintain in the sense
that altering of states preferences are by virtue of ideals]{.underline}
rather than use of coercion. Thus, by virtue of socialization of
hegemonic power, [relative changes in hegemon's distribution of material
power]{.underline} (military and economy) [does not put strain on the
international system.]{.underline} So, on viewing the world from the
lens of socialization, it can be argued that the expansion of US
normative principles on liberal economic norm to its former allies and
enemies aftermath the second world war that led to the formation of the
current liberal economic world order provides an explanation as to why
in spite of US' relative decline there is continuity for America's
liberal economic order. \[3\] The rising challenger China can be
considered to have been socialized -- it has accepted US led
international norms, and participates in various International
Organizations. Thus, [it makes less sense for China to wage war against
the hegemon whose ideals it has internalized.]{.underline} Hegemonic
Stability Theory According to this theory, a hegemon creates a stable
international economic order characterized by market openness but its
decline results in global instability. This hegemonic effect of open
trade benefits all participants, especially, weaker states that do not
have any burden of public goods. In this sense, global economic
stability is born out of hegemony and provides provision of collective
public goods and in doing so facilitates a stable international system.
The motivation to create an economic openness lie in the interest of the
hegemon -- it has the largest economy and so benefits most from open
markets. In addition, only hegemons have the material capability
(political and military) to provide public goods and induce other states
to embrace open trade. \[4\] By virtue of the Hegemonic Stability
Theory, the hegemon is an important element in creation and maintenance
of the international system. As stated earlier, open trade benefits all
participants, even the rising challengers that are accommodated in the
system. In contemporary world politics, China is the fastest rising
power and it is also reaping the benefits of the open economic order
created by the US. By participating in the globalized economy, China has
earned a comparative advantage in labor-market and its economy has been
growing. On top of that China is an export-based economy and thus, it
has very little incentive to jeopardize this benefit by engaging with
the hegemon and thereby disrupting the order. In his article, Artur
Stein has argued that decline in hegemony does not bring about a
complete collapse of the trade regime as long as hegemonic power is
committed to economic openness. Taking these two points in
consideration, it can be argued that [it is not in the interest of China
to challenge US hegemony.]{.underline} On account, likelihood of war is
averted. \[5\] Robert Keohane and Institutionalist Approach In After
Hegemony, Robert Keohane uses an institutional approach to explain
inter-state cooperation. He posits that [states have common interest and
in order to realize it requires achieving mutually beneficial agreements
which is where international regimes come in.]{.underline} These regimes
foster cooperation by making it easier to reach mutually beneficial
inter-state agreements. They help overcome the problem of lack of
qualitative and asymmetrical information, through institutional
embeddedness reduces transaction costs, legal costs reduce incentive to
cheat thereby reducing uncertainty and building confidence among states.
Since hegemonic leadership is required to create regimes in the first
place, even after the erosion of hegemony, they have high stakes and
play important role in fostering cooperation (US role in the IMF and
WTO). Because cooperation fosters absolute gain, all participants are
benefitted. \[6\] By this approach, [states see cooperation more
beneficial than conflict.]{.underline} Thus, it can be argued from
institutionalist approach that [international regimes foster cooperation
thereby reducing likelihood of conflict in the event of hegemonic
decline.]{.underline} Conclusion The article provided four distinct
perspectives with regards to declining US hegemony and potential of a
hegemonic war. Using these approaches the article concludes that [in
spite of decline in American hegemony there will not be a significant
change in the current structure of the international system mainly due
to power differentials between the US and its nearest challenger China.
The US]{.underline} is undergoing a relative decline but still, it [is
the largest economy boasts strongest military and has highest political
leverage.]{.underline} In sum, [prospect of a hegemonic war in
contemporary world politics is only a far-fetched dream.]{.underline}

### AT: Transition Wars

**Transition wars are peaceful**

**White 08** \[2008, White, Lynn T., Lynn T. White III is Professor of
Politics and International Affairs at Princeton, and in 2007-08 he was
the Acting Director at Princeton of the China and the World Program.,
"Steve Chan, China, the U.S., and the Power- Transition Theory: A
Critique", China Perspectives,
<https://journals.openedition.org/chinaperspectives/4789>\]//AA

1Is a future Sino-American war probable or not? If it began, would it
likely be started by China as a rising power, or by America as a
declining hegemon? 2Many theorists of power transitions have seen the
twentieth century's world wars as conflicts started by Germany seeking
to replace Britain as a world hegemon. Contemporary application of that
paradigm suggests that America, while still strong, might muster
resources to resist China's rising power. [Steve Chan argues, however,
that this version of power-transition theory is inaccurate as a
description of the past and self-fulfilling as a prophesy of war. He
likens **the future Sino-American power shift to smoother transitions,
such as that from Britain to the US.**]{.underline} 3Although "officials
and scholars construct realities (\...) the U.K. chose to appease the
U.S. and oppose Germany." Chan suggests Britain's motives were not
cultural: "The argument for \[Anglo-American\] affinity will hardly
suffice to explain London's decision to recruit Japan as a junior
partner in the Asia Pacific during the late 1800s (\...)" (p. 4). He
claims that Germany's main fears in the 1910s and 1930s were of a rising
Russia, and that Berlin's efforts to keep London (and then Washington)
neutral failed when smaller allies' interests in war trumped the
interests of larger powers in peace. [Tails wag dogs before major
conflicts.]{.underline} 4Chan suggests that **[rising states are
rational enough not to go to war merely because of past humiliations or
current regime-type differences.]{.underline}** Instead, [they become
violent when they expect the result of war may be a net gain for
them.]{.underline} "Wars happen because there are discrepancies between
states' power shares and their benefit shares" among either newcomers or
hegemons. Danger arises when national leaders believe they do not
receive a "'fair' share of benefits in proportion to their power" (p.
75). For example, if a dissatisfied state has prospered from exports (as
China has, at least until 2009), a keen sense of past insults may shape
rhetoric without creating violence. 5Chan predicts that [a Sino-American
power transition "is unlikely to materialize in the next three or so
decades at the earliest, if at all"]{.underline} (p. 9). Taiwan, if it
declared independence, could threaten this peace. But Chan expects (and
joins this reviewer in hoping) that [American policy can avoid a war by
continuing to assure both Beijing and Taipei that the US will not defend
such a declaration.]{.underline} 6To make his critique, Chan parses both
logical categories and empirical evidence. While commending Chan's
variety of styles of argumentation, this reviewer prefers the specific
histories to the incorporeal logics. It is possible to object to some of
the ways the book mixes them. For example, Chan notes that most
power-transition theorists in Germany before either world war saw the US
as a non-central contender in world politics because of Berlin's overly
exclusive attention to the European continent. But it might be simpler
to say that Berlin underestimated the reactions of both London and
Washington and overestimated Germany's power. Greater immunity to the
lure of the abstract could lead a writer to express more direct hope
that Beijing does not act externally until its power is enough for
peaceful Chinese success. 7To take another example, it is hard to
estimate the truth of a sentence such as "A severe sense of insecurity,
rather than overconfidence, was the impetus behind Japan's military
planning \[before Pearl Harbor\]" (p. 56). Insecurity and overconfidence
are both documentable as factors in this mistake. Social scientists,
including many whom Chan rightly criticises, tend to like the kind of
monocausal explanation that could have been avoided here. 8Chan
organises a convincingly full panoply of historical similes and
theorised causations (including several versions of realism,
institutionalism, and constructivism). To make a long story short, he
concludes as an optimist. Big wars can occur when rising powers
underestimate extended deterrence by hegemons that do not make their
interests clear. But Chan does not think this will happen any time soon
in the Sino-American case, where both major powers are nuclear, and
where the most relevant deterrence is of an attack on Taiwan, presuming
the island does not legally renounce its option to be part of China.
9[The danger of Sino-American war would come from US indecision over
whether to deter a conflict if it could, or to make concessions if it
could not.]{.underline} Chan says [the PRC's neighbours, including
Taiwan, are more likely to engage China's prosperity than resist
it.]{.underline} He argues that [if China receives adequate net benefits
from its overall relations with America, **there will be
peace.**]{.underline} He guesses that "current trends favour an eventual
settlement of Taiwan's status" (p. 119). Severe economic depression,
more nationalist definitions of "benefit" among Beijing leaders, and/or
a resurgence of Taiwanese nationalism might suggest less optimism---but
Chan suggests that politicians can continue to avert a war. 10This
reviewer guesses [Chan is right]{.underline}, even though some of his
interpretations are expressed in unnecessarily complex forms. He claims,
"For a policy of pivotal deterrence to be credible, Taipei must be made
to believe that Washington does not really intend to abandon it should
it declare formal independence" (p. 101). This sentence depends on an
involuted discussion of differences between "pivotal" and "extended"
deterrence, but that framework omits consideration of factors such as
American naval capabilities or internal politics in Taiwan or the
PRC---and after Chan introduces such factors, the discourse becomes
convincing. Some theory is always needed before empirical data are
gathered, but Chan is all too faithful to contemporary political science
on the unusual occasions when he puts deduction prior to induction
without noting the iterative feedback between them. 11Important
prospective readers of this book are in China. Some, apparently
including the Peking University Dean Wang Jisi, would believe Chan's
opinion that no power transition may take place soon. Their foreign
policy is thus careful. But the most important readers of the book are
American, if they see Chan's evidence that declining hegemons (often
spurred to war by much smaller allies) have made crucial decisions that
led to world wars. 12A power transition point is evidenced if one
nation's power surpasses that of another. Yet there are big problems
with criteria such as a "composite index of national capability," which
has been used by researchers in the Correlates of War Project, and also
with criteria developed by the CIA and others. Chinese social scientists
such as Tsinghua Professor Yan Xuetong have been avid surveyors of
national power, and Yan includes a subjective factor: the degree of will
to use objective capabilities. "Soft" cultural power has also been
subject to surveys: numbers of tourists or foreign students or movies.
Dangers of unnecessary tragic war lurk in the wide grey-area ranges (not
points) in which asymmetric conflict is possible and the crossover of
effective power is uncertain. 13A problem of power-transition theory,
which Chan mentions but does not stress, is that [power is meaningless
when separated from the goals for which it is exerted.]{.underline} The
current global "superpower" has not been all that super in places such
as Somalia, or in serving its own interests in the Middle East. Chan's
criticisms of power transition are cogent, and he might have extended
them by stressing that it is hard to interpret measures of power
abstracted from its purposes.

#### Chinese hegemony is impossible -- no one else wants it 

**Ikenberry 18** -- is the Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and
International Affairs at Princeton University, 3/9/18 (John, \"Why the
Liberal World Order Will Survive\", *Ethics & International Affairs*,

Competitive Order Building [Even if we were to assume that China, as the
leading non-Western state, wanted to undermine and replace the existing
liberal international order, the constraints on doing so are
overwhelmin]{.underline}g. Presumably, an alternative order would be
less open and less rule-based. Historically, such orders have been
organized into various illiberal political formations: regional
groupings, imperial zones, spheres of influence, and closed autarkic
blocs. How might China and other rising states build a comprehensive
alternative to the existing order? [As a start, China would need to be
able to come forward with some alternative set of rules and
institutions, presumably reflecting an alternative model of political
and economic organization. T]{.underline}his might be a so-called
"Beijing Consensus," an international order that accommodated (and even
promoted) illiberal and authoritarian polities and statist economic
relations. China does have its own statist approach, but it is not clear
how this approach might work as a wider model of global order. First,
[China's mercantilist strategy seems to work best when the rest of the
world is relatively open and liberal in orientation.]{.underline} A
closed world in which great powers carve out spheres of influence cuts
off China from markets and investment opportunities. [If all the
countries of the world adopted the Chinese model, this would restrict
China's market space and leadership opportunities.]{.underline} Second,
[a Chinese-led illiberal international order would require some buy-in
by other states, and this is also problematic. C]{.underline}hina is the
largest and leading non-Western developing country, but it is the only
rising state that is genuinely illiberal and authoritarian[. It is not
clear that Brazil, India, South Africa, or even Turkey is eager to
embrace and operate within a Beijing consensus.]{.underline} If China
were to try to promulgate [a Sino-centered order]{.underline}---a
hegemonic/imperial order that did not immediately rest on the consent
and cooperation of other states---it [would face very steep costs. If
these potential partner states did not experience substantial material
benefits from participating in the Chinese-led order, China would need
to spend resources to entice and bully these states into
cooperation.]{.underline} This would be a very huge task for a
developing country with mid-range per capita income. Over the longer
term, the success of a Chinese-centered order would depend on its
ability to "outcompete" liberal internationalism. But the less the rival
order is open and negotiated, and the less that China---as a rival
hegemon ---is willing to exercise restraint and provide public goods,
the greater the difficulty it will have in establishing a viable and
legitimate alternative.

A Kindleberger Trap as a Strategic Challenge?

As China's power grows, many observers worry the United States and China
are destined for war, but few consider an opposite disruptive danger in
hegemonic transitions. Rather than acting like a revolutionary power in
the international order, [China might decide to be a free rider like the
United States was in the 1930s.]{.underline} I have called this a
"Kindleberger Trap" after the renowned MIT economist who attributed [the
depths of the Great Depression and the instability of that decade to a
rising America's failure to contribute to global public goods at time
when Great Britain could no longer do so alone.25 In this version of the
failure of hegemonic power transition, China may act too weakly rather
than too strongly and refuse to contribute to an international order
that it did not create.]{.underline} Some Sinologists say that this fear
overstates the "not invented here" problem and that China knows it
benefited from the overall post-1945 international order. As Iain
Johnston has shown, one can distinguish at least eight different orders
related to eight areas of interdependence, and China's support for the
orders is medium to high in most.26

[A Kindleberger Trap is a free rider, or failure by a rising power to
contribute to global public goods.]{.underline}

To date, [China has been quite active in supporting institutions that
facilitate world order and interdependence]{.underline}. [In the UN
Security Council]{.underline}, China is one of five countries with a
veto. [China is now the second largest funder of UN peacekeeping
forces]{.underline}, participating in UN programs related to Ebola and
climate change. China has also benefited greatly from economic
institutions like the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). On the other hand, China has started
its own Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and a "Belt and
Road" initiative (BRI) of international infrastructure projects that
some see as an economic offensive against the existing order. China has
not practiced full reciprocity as a market economy, and its rejection of
a 2016 Hague tribunal ruling regarding the South [China]{.underline} Sea
[raised questions about whether China would treat its legal
obligations]{.underline} a la carte (as the United States has sometimes
done). US and allied navies' freedom of navigation operations in the
South China Sea remain essential to maintain this point. (It would also
help if the US Senate would ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty.)

Thus far, [China has not tried to overthrow the world order from which
it benefits---rather, it has tried to increase its influence from
within---but this could change as Chinese power grows.]{.underline} The
Trump administration labeled China a revisionist power, but so far [it
is moderate revisionism]{.underline}, unlike extreme revisionist powers
such as Hitler's Germany. [China is interested not in kicking over the
card table but in tilting the table so it can claim a larger share of
the winnings. At the same time, China's growing economic power and its
tilt will create problems for the United States and the international
order.]{.underline} In other words, it may act as a free rider as the
United States did in the 1930s.

[As Chinese power grows, the American "liberal international order" will
have to change]{.underline}. It was never all liberal, orderly, or
global, and [China has little interest in liberalism or American
domination.]{.underline} Therefore, Americans would be wise to discard
the terms "liberal" and "American" and think in terms of an "open and
rules-based" world order to manage the various types of interdependence.
This would mean [framing an open international order in terms of
institutional cooperation. Ideological differences will persist, and
there will be sharp differences over values like human
rights]{.underline}, but this does not prevent negotiations and
institutions to manage interdependence.27 [The US approach to an open
international economy will need to be adjusted for greater oversight of
Chinese trade and investments that threaten our technological and
national security objectives]{.underline}, but there is still a basis
for fruitful interdependence and negotiation of rules of the road to
govern it.

#### **US and China decouple [now]{.underline}, but China won't [catch up]{.underline} for decades.**

Managing Interdependence

[Some degree of decoupling is bound to increase, particularly in areas
related to technology that directly affect national security. Both sides
will wish to limit vulnerabilities that endanger critical infrastructure
or have important implications for military postures]{.underline}. Some
measures will be unilateral, such as those Beijing has been undertaking
for more than a decade. [As for US measures to restrict sensitive
technology transfer via trade, investment, and scientific exchanges,
"developing a control regime that reduces risk without imposing undue
costs will not be easy."]{.underline}28

[Intricate supply chains are not easily undone. But bilateral and
multilateral negotiations can help to prevent partial technological
disengagement from degenerating into a stampede toward full
protectionism.]{.underline} One example is provided by a group of
American and Chinese [economists who have suggested a framework for
trade policy between divergent nations that distinguishes the areas
subject to bilateral negotiations from those where countries are allowed
to undertake well-calibrated domestic policy adjustments that minimize
harm to its domestic economy or security.]{.underline} Other policies
that involve damage spilling over to third countries could be handled by
multilateral arrangements.29

Negotiations can help prevent partial technological disengagement from
degenerating into a stampede.

As China, India, and other economies grow, [the US share of the world
economy will be less than it was at the beginning of this
century]{.underline}, and the rise of other countries will make it more
difficult to organize collective action to promote global public goods.
But [no other country---including China---is about to replace the United
States in terms of overall power resources in the next few decades. The
United States will continue to lead in production of global public
goods, but it will need to increasingly share that role with
China.]{.underline} Since the Nixon administration, China and the United
States have cooperated despite ideological differences. Various forms of
interdependence have grown, and efforts toward total decoupling would
involve enormous costs. While interdependence has created new strategic
vulnerabilities, it has also produced strategic opportunities.

[Rapid Asian economic growth has encouraged a power shift to the region,
but Asia has its own internal balance of power. Chinese power is
balanced by Japan, India, and Australia, among others.]{.underline} None
want to be dominated by China, though none wants to see a Cold War-style
containment strategy that would force them into an economic divorce from
China, either. [The United States will remain crucial to that Asian
balance of power. If the United States maintains those alliances, the
prospects are slight that China can drive the United States from the
Western Pacific, much less dominate the world.]{.underline} The United
States has high cards for managing the traditional competitive parts of
our cooperative rivalry with China and does not need to seek to sever
the relationship entirely by completely decoupling in a fit of panic.

[The more difficult question for an effective strategy will be whether
the United States and China can develop attitudes that allow them to
cooperate in producing global public goods and managing interdependence
while competing in other areas]{.underline}. Worst case analyses may
make such a balanced policy impossible. The US-China relationship is a
cooperative rivalry where a successful strategy of "smart competition,"
as advocated by Orville Schell and Susan Shirk, will require equal
attention to both aspects of that description.30 But such a future will
require good contextual intelligence and careful management of all
dimensions of our interdependence, both negative and positive.
[Exaggerated fears will make such a balanced policy difficult, and hasty
efforts to decouple will lead to a failed strategy that reduces US
power.]{.underline}

### [AT: China Heg Bad]{.underline}

#### Chinese regional hegemony compatible with American interests. 

**Haynes, PhD, 17**

(Kyle, Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at
Purdue University, Would China Be a Benign Hegemon?

https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/would-china-be-a-benign-hegemon/)

The 1901 Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, in which Britain abjectly caved to
American demands to build and fortify the canal, facilitated a "great
rapprochement" between the two Anglo-Saxon powers and laid the
groundwork for a the "special relationship" that continues today. But
this happy precedent offers little solace to contemporary observers of
U.S.-China relations. [China's militarized island-building campaign in
the South China Sea and aggressive pursuit of territorial claims
elsewhere in the region have convinced many that China's intentions are
fundamentally incompatible with America's interests in East Asia. In
response, they claim, the United States should implement a more
confrontational strategy to counter China's efforts and sustain
America's regionally hegemonic position. I argue that these
**conclusions are premature**. China's grand strategy is clearly aimed
at supplanting the United States as the dominant military power in East
Asia. But this alone **does not mean** that **Chinese and American
interests are incompatible**.]{.underline} The real question is what
China plans to do with its emerging regional preponderance. Would [China
use its hegemony to maintain an **economically open,
institutionalized,** and **rule-based regional order**,]{.underline}
even if one that is tilted in its own favor? Or would it seek to
fundamentally overthrow these decades-old rules and norms in ways that
effectively exclude outside economic engagement and threaten the
territorial integrity of America's regional allies? If the latter, then
the costs and risks of a more confrontational policy of "containing"
China's rise may be justified. If the former, then [Chinese regional
hegemony is **perfectly compa**tible with America's **substantive
interests**, and may even help r**educe** the **burden** **of** the
**U**nited **S**tates' expansive global commitments. To date, there are
surprisingly **few** **indications** that a Chinese-led regional order
would be antithetical to core American interests in the
region.]{.underline} Why Hegemony? Greater levels of military power
allow states to secure their borders and impose favorable political or
economic outcomes in their own backyard. But critically, power is still
a means to an end. Power itself is of little use except as a means of
attaining substantive strategic goals. Given the uncertainty inherent in
international politics, states understandably covet the capacity to look
after their own interests. Dependence on others inherently entails
vulnerability. But this capacity is only valuable insofar as it enables
a state to achieve outcomes of more substantive value. The United States
has occupied a hegemonic position in East Asia since the end of World
War II. This preponderance has allowed the United States to guarantee
vital regional interests through its own efforts for over 70 years. It
is thus understandably jarring for many Americans to imagine a world
where core national security interests in East Asia are dependent upon a
foreign power's acquiescence. But maintaining military preponderance
should not be considered a core American interest in East Asia. To
reiterate, hegemony is only valuable if it helps a state achieve more
substantive interests. It would be foolish to incur the massive costs
and risks of containing China in order to maintain U.S. regional
hegemony if Washington were confident that a Chinese-dominated regional
order would uphold core American interests. [As such, American policy
toward China should be guided by signals of what exactly Chinese leaders
would seek to do with their emerging regional hegemony, not the fact
that they're pursuing this hegemony in the first place.]{.underline}
Assertive or Incompatible? Charting a course for U.S. grand strategy in
East Asia requires asking three key questions. First, what are the
United States' vital substantive interests in the region? Second, how
costly will it be for the United States to maintain its longstanding
regional dominance in the face of China's rise? And third, how likely
are its interests to be maintained within a regional order dominated by
China? First, with respect to core regional interests, the United States
fundamentally seeks to maintain an open, liberal economic order and to
maintain the territorial and political security of its regional allies.
This would necessitate upholding the freedom of navigation throughout
the region's international waters, including the South and East China
Seas. Second, given China's enormous population, geographic location,
and economic dynamism, it will be impossibly costly for the United
States to sustain its regionally dominant position over the coming
years. With declining economic clout and a military dispersed across the
globe, U.S. containment of Chinese influence in East Asia is futile.
[So, if containing China would be immensely costly and probably futile,
how badly are America's core regional interests likely to suffer under a
Chinese-led regional order? Pessimistic observers point to the recent
"assertive shift" in China's foreign policy, along with the expansion of
China's military capabilities, as indications that leaders in Beijing
harbor deeply revisionist ambitions in the region. After all, why would
China be seeking to deny the U.S. military access inside the first
island chain if it didn't anticipate taking actions directly contrary to
vital American interests there? This interpretation overlooks the simple
fact that great powers do not tolerate competitors possessing the
military capacity dominate their home region. As a rising great power,
China would seek to **control its immediate periphery** irrespective of
any revisionist intentions.]{.underline} During the 1996 Taiwan Strait
crisis, the USS Nimitz battle group sailed through the Taiwan Strait,
effectively intimidating Beijing into deescalating the crisis. Imagine
the American response if a Chinese aircraft carrier sailed between Cuba
and Florida during a Sino-American crisis. Even satisfied great powers
will not allow foreign competitors to militarily control their
near-abroad. That China would seek to deny the United States this
capacity is entirely predictable, and not necessarily an indication of
revisionist intentions. Implications of Assertiveness China's assertive
shift has challenged the territorial claims of key American allies, but
[there is **little indication** that Chinese leaders harbor territorial
ambitions beyond what was claimed in the immediate post-World War II
period]{.underline} (including the nine-dash line, which dates back to
1947). The more aggressive pursuit of longstanding claims does not
necessarily portend new, more expansive claims down the road.
Furthermore, China's recent push to supplant the United States has
revolved around a series of alternative institutions to guide regional
economic integration. These institutions will surely tilt toward
Beijing, but they also bind China into a rules-based order that will
constrain its ability to bully and coerce its neighbors. In short, a
[China-led regional order may entail some Chinese expansionism, but
there is little indication that it would threaten the **core territorial
security of American allies.**]{.underline} Furthermore, China's vision
for the regional economic order seems to be premised on an alternative
set of institutions geared toward maximizing Beijing's economic returns.
This may undercut some American economic interests in the region. But it
will broadly retain an institutionalized framework built on the rules
and norms established under U.S. hegemony after World War II.

#### China's economic hegemony will sustain developing countries.

and growth in the global South

https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/206617/1/1681792362.pdf)

[Our article quantifies the impacts of exports to and imports from China
on GDP in major developing economies. We find the positive contributions
of imports from China to GDP,]{.underline} although such positive
contributions are still lower than that of EDE and AdE. However, impacts
of China on growth becomes much more significant since the financial
crisis while EDE and AdE show decreasing or almost unchanged role in
pushing growth in the global South. [These findings seem to confirm the
arguments of international studies scholars on **China as a new and
benign hegemon** on the horizon. The **developing world's growth** is
increasingly **dependent on Chinese goods**. Strengthening trade with
China might be indispensable for the global South to **sustain growt**h
in the future. This puts more serious pressure on policy makers in, on
the one hand, achieving short-run growth goals through **promoting**
imports from **China**]{.underline} and, on another hand, ensuring the
competitiveness of the domestic production in longer-run. Our analysis
shows the insignificant contributions of the exports to China on growth
in its developing partners. Most of the exports to China from the
developing world are raw materials or low-technological products, which
contribute marginally to growth. Moreover, the rise of China might not
create opportunities for developing countries to upgrade considerably
its production. However, with the coming transformation of the Chinese
economy from export led to consumption‐led growth, EDE might see a more
significant role of China as a major importer for goods and services in
the near future. Lee et al. (2017) show that economies that have a small
share of consumption goods in their exports to China might suffer a
significant decrease in their exports to China. At the same time,
China's transformation also creates valuable opportunities for countries
that satisfy growing consumption demands of the Chinese population.
Similarly, Park and Shin (2011: 160) indicate that China becomes "more
of consumer and less of an assembler", which heralds the potential of
higher exports to China, as a new source of growth, in the coming time
for the developing world. In addition, China is becoming a more
important producer of sophisticated goods with higher labor costs and an
aging labor force, leaving some opportunities for other developing
economies to materialize their potentials, either by replacing China or
being a part of the production chain led by China.

### AT: Thucydides Trap

#### The U.S. and China won't fall into the Thucydides trap and will find a way to peacefully coexist

**Jayathilaka 4/11**/22 \[11 Apr 2022, Jayathilaka, Aruna, Department of

Political Science, "Are China and the USA Heading for a War ? (Can they
Avoid the \'\'Thucydides Trap\'\'?)", SSRN,
<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4075526>, AA\]

[Thucydides]{.underline} (460- 404 BC), finest of historical Greek
historians and writer of the History of the Peloponnesian War, which
recounts the war among Athens and Sparta within side the fifth century
B.C. He [was also named as the father of the school of political
realism\', which views the political behavior of people and the
resulting effects of relations between states as ultimately mediated and
based on \"fear and self-interests\'.]{.underline} As he explained, \"It
was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that
made war inevitable.\" (Allison, 2015). Thucydides recognized key
drivers of this dynamic: the growing power\'s developing entitlement,
experience of its importance, and call for more say and sway, on the
only hand, and the fear, insecurity, and resolution to protect the
popularity quo this engenders within side the mounted power, at the
other (Allison, 2017). 3.1 Graham Allison on the Thucydides' Trap Graham
Tillett **[Allison]{.underline}**, an American political scientist and
the Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at the John F. Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard University, **[recognized Thucydides Trap as
the best framework to understand why there is potential for conflict
between the United States and China.]{.underline}** (Allison, The
Thucydides Trap, 2017) The Harvard Thucydides\' Trap Project has
identified **[sixteen cases over the last 500 years in which a major
rising power threatened to dethrone a major ruling
power.]{.underline}**( Figure 01) Figure 01 : Thucydides' Trap in the
history Power struggle between China and USA Source : (Allison, 2015)
Source: ( Harvard Kennedy School of Government, 2021)
**[Twelve]{.underline}** of these sixteen contenders **[resulted in
warfare.]{.underline}** Allison uses the cases to demonstrate how [the
tension between rising and ruling powers frequently leads to
war]{.underline} and how the war was avoided in the four rivalries that
did not result in violence. Allison views that [China\'s attempt to
challenge the US hegemony will create an avenue for a war.]{.underline}
According to Allison, the Chinese government\'s action plan for
achieving this goal includes: revitalizing the Party, restoring its
sense of mission, and reestablishing its authority in the eyes of the
Chinese people; reviving Chinese nationalism and patriotism to inculcate
pride in being Chinese; engineering a third economic revolution, and
reorganizing and rebuilding China\'s military so that it can \'fight and
win.\' (Allison, Avoiding the Thucydides Trap, 2018) In addition,
Allison revives Samuel Huntington\'s classic thesis about the clash of
civilizations. He argues that [China\'s pursuit of its goals resulted
from \'deep cultural\' differences.]{.underline} (Table:01) Table 01 :
\'Deep Cultural\' differences between USA and China Source: (Allison,
The Thucydides Trap, 2017) 04. Reponses on the 'Thucydides Trap' The
concept of the \"Thucydides Trap\" and the debates around it have
influenced academics, international media, including Chinese official
media, and American and Chinese politicians. 4.1 Scholars views on
'Thucydides Trap' In comparison, international scholars are more
diversified in the concept. There are generally three views; Pessimistic
Views, optimistic, and Realistic Views. 4.1.1 Pessimistic Views The
first view, mainly from Western and American scholars, is quite
pessimistic. They believe that U.S.-China relations have fallen into or
are about to enter the "Thucydides' Trap." For instance, in May 2015,
American scholar David Lampton, who used to express much hope for a
sound and lasting U.S.-China relationship, delivered a speech at the
World Forum on China Studies, stating that "tipping point in U.S.-China
relations is upon us. and that we are witnessing the erosion of some
critical underlying supports for predominantly positive U.S.-China ties"
(Lampton, 2015). Analysts and officials in Washington are fretting over
"worsening tensions between the United States and China and the risks to
the world of two superpowers once again clashing rather than
cooperating". (Michael Beckley and Hal Brands 2021). According to these
analysis, a cold war with Beijing is already under way. Hence, it is not
surprising that the Chinese continue to see the USA's 'hegemony,'
military presence, and alliances with others as major stumbling blocks
for China's attempts to maintain its sovereignty and territorial
integrity (To, 2003) 4.1.2 Optimistic Views However, most Chinese
analysts believe that **[the \"Thucydides\' Trap\" cannot adequately
characterize Sino-US ties.]{.underline}** They have explored strategies
for both countries to escape the trap by deconstructing the notion\'s
flaws. Professor Qin Yaqing, for example, discovers that the Chinese
philosophical paradigm of \"Yin and Yang Dialectics\" differs markedly
from Western concepts of \"conflict and confrontation.\" As a result,
[rather than viewing China\'s ascent as a zero-sum game, it should be
seen holistically and historically.]{.underline} Professor Qian Shengdan
stated unequivocally that [the \"Thucydides\' Trap\" was incompatible
with historical events]{.underline} and may not apply to Sino-US
relations. Several Western academics share this viewpoint. For example,
Henry Kissinger claims no \"Thucydides\' Trap\" between China and the US
until individuals make it a \"self-fulfilled prophecy\" (Coker, 2015).
In his essay \"Beware the Thucydides Trap\'s Trap,\" James Holmes argues
that the Sino-US relationship is fundamentally different from the
Athenian-Spartan relationship and the Anglo-German alliance before World
War I. Richard Lebow similarly disputes the inevitability of conflict
between Athens and Sparta, arguing that the Peloponnesian War might have
been averted if both sides had shown greater empathy and therefore taken
a more moderate posture (Lebow, 2021). 4.1.3 Realistic Views Rather than
agreeing or disagreeing with the concept, the third point of view is
concerned with finding a replacement parallel to represent Sino-American
ties. For example, Professor Yan Xuetong suggests that [the battle
between China and the United States is]{.underline} \"more like a
football game than a boxing fight,\" implying that it is [not always a
zero-sum game that ends in a knockout.]{.underline} Indeed, the term
\"new type of major-country relations\" has become more widely used in
recent years; **[despite their current trade disputes and increasingly
intense competition, both China and the United States are aiming for a
reciprocal relationship of \"no conflict, no confrontation, mutual
respect, and win-win cooperation.\"]{.underline}** (Bondaz, 2015) 4.2
Responses of the Leaders As the \"Thucydides\' Trap\" concept grows in
popularity, it is frequently discussed by prominent Chinese and American
leaders and officials. [Both Chinese and American leaders are hopeful
about their countries\' ability to avoid the \"Thucydides\'
Trap.\"]{.underline} China\'s President Xi Jinping declared in 2014 that
\"we all need to work together to avoid the \'Thucydides\' Trap.\" In
his address in Seattle on September 24, 2015, he said unequivocally that
\"\[t\]here is no such thing in the world as the so- called Thucydides\'
trap.\" However, if powerful countries repeatedly commit strategic
miscalculation errors, they may build such traps for themselves.\" (Ling
Shengli and Lv Huiyi, 2018) In response, then-US President Barack Obama
stated in 2015 that he did not agree with the concept of \"Thucydides\'
Trap\" and its significance to US-China ties. Although President Trump
has not said firmly if there is a \"Thucydides\' Trap\" between China
and the United States, he has often stated that both nations should
preserve cooperation while managing their disagreements. President Trump
stated at his meeting with President Xi at Mar-a-Lago in April 2017 that
the US \"is eager to further deepen cooperation with China in business,
military issues, and people-to- people exchanges\... \". He also stated,
\"\[i\]n the next months and years, I look forward to developing an even
stronger partnership between our two nations, China and the United
States of America, as well as even deeper friendships and interactions
amongst our people. Clearly, neither the Chinese nor the American
leaders believe their country will fall into the \"Thucydides\' Trap\"
(Ling Shengli and Lv Huiyi, 2018). Even though Chinses and American
leaders have been shown an optimistic viewpoint on the Thucydides\'
Trap, some world leaders have shown a pessimistic view on it. President
Lee Kuan Yew is a case in point. As he stated, "Unlike other emergent
countries, China wants to be China and accepted as such, not as an
honorary member of the West. The Chinese will want to share this century
as co-equals with the United States." ( Allison, Lee Kuan Yew: The Sage
of Asia, 2015). Further he views that China "is the biggest player in
the history of the world," and the United States and others will have to
adjust to this reality. But this adjustment may not be peaceful.
(Richard N. Rosecrance and Steven E. Miller, 2014) 05. Pushing and
Pulling Factors of the Thucydides Trap Analysts have warned that the
South China Sea could be the tipping point for a military conflict
between the two. As always, the USA is seeking military dominance and
superiority in Asia- Pacific and elsewhere. Notably, while supporting
the US-led war on terror for its reasons, China still criticized the USA
for increasing its military presence across the world after the
terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 (Straits Times, 2002). It appears
that the Trump administration is conscious of the unfavorable aspects of
its foreign policy (\"interventionism\" and \"unilateralism\" in
international politics), notably in the Middle East. However, [the
United States cannot alter the global system]{.underline} as China seeks
to grow its strength and influence globally and reform the old liberal
international order (Yahuda, 2019). Some analysists view that [the
military tension between US and China was declining under the Joe Biden
administration.]{.underline} These analyses show that, after former
President Donald Trump launched his trade war with China, indications
are that President Joe Biden's administration is continuing his
confrontational approach to the bilateral relationship while rallying
Western and regional allies around calling out Beijing for its flouting
of international norms (Yang X. , 2021). Nevertheless, agreements as,
AUKUS will enhance the war tension between US and China while providing
a fertile ground for a 'Thucydides Trap'. On September 15, 2021,
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States signed AUKUS, a
trilateral security treaty for the Indo-Pacific region. According to the
deal\'s provisions, the United States and the United Kingdom will assist
Australia in deploying nuclear-powered submarines (Biscop, 2021).
Cooperation in \"cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum
technologies, and more subsea capabilities\" is also included in the
pact. Australia\'s air force, navy, and army would all gain enhanced
long-range attack capabilities as part of the arrangement. Instead of
the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing cooperation, which includes New
Zealand and Canada, the alliance will focus on military capability
(Oxford Analytica, 2021). China has criticized the new agreement as
\"extremely irresponsible.\" Zhao Lijian, a foreign ministry spokesman,
stated that this agreement \"seriously undermines regional peace and
stability and intensifies the arms race.\" In Washington, the Chinese
embassy accused the countries entering this agreement of having a \"Cold
War mentality and ideological prejudice\" (BBC, 2021). Nevertheless,
some analysts argue that **[neither China nor the United States intends
to reorder the world by winning a decisive war.]{.underline}** Because
they both know that a confrontation of this magnitude might be
disastrous, they are attempting to win without fighting, relying on
international laws and rule-making to confine their opponents and mold
the world in their favor. Unlike previous great power competitions, the
United States and China are competing over the content of international
laws. As a result, [both camps will rely on \"new global norms and
agreements"]{.underline} (Scott, 2021) 5.1 Is the Thucydides Trap a
replacement of Churchill Trap? Winston Churchill made his now famous
\"Iron Curtain\" speech at Westminster College, Fulton, March 5, 1946,
an event that many have seen as the symbolic inauguration of the Cold
War. (Kluge, 2003). The term "iron curtain" had been employed as a
metaphor since the 19th century, but Churchill used it to refer
specifically to the political, military, and ideological barrier created
by the U.S.S.R. following World War II to prevent open contact between
itself and its dependent eastern and central European allies on the one
hand and the West and other noncommunist regions on the other (Trust,
2021). US diplomat George Kennan came to a similar conclusion and became
the architect of the "containment" policy. He argued that the Soviet
Union was determined to spread of communism throughout the world and was
fundamentally opposed to coexistence with the West. Kennan doubted the
potential effectiveness of attempts to reconcile and pacify the Soviet
Union, but Kennan was confident that the Soviet Union would understand
the logic of military power and temper its ambitions in the face of
strong Western opposition (George Frost Kennan and John Lukacs, 1997).
According to some experts, **[the\' Thucydides trap exaggerates the
possibility of war between emerging and dominant powers in the modern
era.]{.underline}** The most significant difficulty for China and the
United States, according to this viewpoint, is to avoid falling into the
\'Churchill trap.\' By repeating the follies of the Cold War between the
US and the Soviet Union, both camps will be involved in a long-term
struggle. The \'old\' history of the ancient East Asian bipolar system,
as well as modern Sino-US interactions in East Asia, suggest that, in
addition to hegemonic war and the cold war, the two poles have a \'third
type of great power relationship.\' This third kind is known as
\'co-ruling .\' The two superpowers jointly lead most small and
medium-sized states rather than being geographically divided according
to their separate domains of influence. (Yang Y. , 2018). 06. Is there a
Way Out? According to Graham Allison, [there are some possible avenues
for both the China and USA to avoid possible war-tension.]{.underline}
Firstly both the camps should realize that the \'War between nuclear
superpowers is madness\'. Both China and the USA own robust nuclear
arsenal; hence leaders must recognize that war would be suicidal. The
second lesson for both parties is to \'Leaders must be prepared to risk
a war they cannot win\'. It is clear that if war occurs, both nations
lose, and millions die --- an option no rational leader could choose.
(Allison, The Thucydides Trap, 2017). Nevertheless, if a nation is
unwilling to risk war, its opponent can win any objective by forcing the
more reliable power to yield. Consequently, leaders must be willing to
select paths that threaten destruction. The third lesson defines the new
\"precarious rules of the status quo.\" These rules include arms-
control treaties and precise road conventions for air and sea. The
fourth lesson is that parties should understand that \'Domestic
performance is decisive.\' Domestic issues of a country will have an
impact upon international matters. (Allison, The Thucydides Trap: Are
the U.S. and China Headed for War?, 2015). **[By establishing
compromises on problematic areas, the US and China might clear the way
for cooperation on challenges like global terrorism and climate change,
where the two countries\' shared national interests outnumber their
differences.]{.underline}** Overall, leaders must recognize that [their
existence is contingent on]{.underline} prudence, communication,
limitations, compromise, and [cooperation]{.underline}. As Allison
points out, dwindling civic involvement, institutionalized corruption,
and a general lack of faith in politics are all concerning indicators of
the American democracy. Both countries\' leaders would do well to
emphasize their domestic issues by improving residents\' quality of
life. Finally, parties need to understand that hope is not a strategy.
Allison views that if the USA hopes to avoid catastrophic war with China
while protecting and advancing American national interests, lessons of
the Cold War should be well studied. Both the camps need to be aligned
with strategic thinking rather than relying on hope. (Allison, Avoiding
the Thucydides Trap, 2018) Most of the scholars view that, a new
structure for the bilateral relationship is required, taking into
account key areas of rivalry and collaboration. Harvard Professor Joe
Nye expressed hope that the United States will have enough time to
handle China\'s ascent without falling into the second element of the
trap: overreaching out of fear (Coker, 2015). According to Allison,
**[the US and China have significant national interests in preserving
the survival of their respective countries and must work together to
resolve concerns that have clouded the economic
relationship.]{.underline}** This means coming up with new laws to
account for China\'s unparalleled economic growth and global power
status. In addition, policymakers should consider the appeal for a world
that is \"safe for variety\" followed by the \' Cuban Missile Crisis \'.
This development would allow countries with diverse political systems,
economic development methods, and philosophies to peacefully coexist
(Allison, Avoiding the Thucydides Trap, 2018). 07. Summarizing the
Findings The first research question of the paper was: \'is the
\'Thucydides Trap\' a correct metaphor to examine the present global
power structure?\' The study finds diverse viewpoints on the validity of
the \'Thucydides Trap\' for a proper analysis of the US-China
relationship. The \'Pessimistic\' scholars recognize Thucydides Trap as
an accurate metaphor for analyzing the present tension between USA and
China. Nevertheless, \'Pessimistic\' and \'realistic\' **[scholars have
not identified \'Thucydides Trap\' as an ideal metaphor to examine the
current development between USA and China.]{.underline}** According to
some analysts, [other metaphors are more suitable]{.underline} to
elaborate US-China relations than the \'Thucydides trap.\' For an
intense some analysts\' view that the \'Churchill trap\' is a more
present risk to China and the US than the \'Thucydides trap,\' and
consequently one to which both should pay due to heed and take
precautions to avoid (Yang Y. , 2018). Nevertheless, Graham Alison
provides a strong argument for using the \'Thucydides Trap\' to explain
several scholars later admitted US-China relations and this notion.
Consequently, the paper finds that the Thucydides trap provides an
avenue to examine the current development between the USA and China with
data analysis. The second research question was: \'Can China and USA
escape the Thucydides Trap?'. Avoiding the trap might be difficult
indeed, yet not impossible. As being describe by Graham Alison,
\'Thucydides Trap\' can be avoided with huge and painful adjustments by
the super powers. Hence, \'pessimistic\' and \'realistic\' scholars have
shown some of the avenue for avoiding the trap. Further, as being states
by the \'Thucydides Trap\', when Sparta attacked Athens, it forced the
other Greek city-states to pick a side, and a massive Greek war ensued
that lasted for decades. Great power dynamics may undoubtedly cause
tensions, but the judgment is still on whether a \'conflict in Asia is
unavoidable\'. Smaller states play disproportionate roles at times, but
not always. For example, during the conflict, Athens subdued Melos, a
city-state that had wanted to remain neutral in the Peloponnesian War.
Based on these findings, it is clear that the \'Thucydides Trap\' is not
an 'unavoidable\' circumstance. Graham Allison suggests that the main
five lessons that both superpowers should learn to avoid the trap are:
\'realizing the destructiveness of nuclear superpower war\', \'preparing
to risk a war they cannot win\', defining the new \"precarious rules of
the status quo\", realizing that \'domestic performance is decisive\',
and understanding that hope is not a strategy. Most other scholars also
suggest that drastic changes should be made by both the camp to escape
from the trap. Hence, \'the USA and China need to make serious
adjustments to avoid the trap\'. 08. Conclusion **[War]{.underline}**,
as Thucydides explains, **[is preventable.]{.underline}** Since
individuals can do little to address power imbalances, [the only
obstacle they face is poor decision making.]{.underline} So suppose war
can be prevented. In this case, it implies that in making decisions,
individuals, leaders, and people avoid interpersonal interactions
creating the \"real trap\" that the ancient thinker warned us. As for
the future of Sino- American relations, no one knows precisely. However,
we can predict the future based on the current development of the two
great powers. The United States has used hard power in several world
crises. However, China has only used soft power at the most critical
moments. This trend reduces the risk of war between the two countries.
To deal with China\'s ascent, it appears the United States will employ a
mix of commitment and containment. Similarly, a military clash with the
United States will negatively impact China\'s economic progress. But, on
the other hand, limitations and flaws in China\'s regional accent,
notably its rising reliance on Middle Eastern oil, will push Beijing to
stick to its \"peaceful development\" approach. All in all, **[in a
bipolar system, the United States and China will find a way to coexist,
thus avoiding the \'Thucydides trap.\']{.underline}**

## AT: Retrenchment Bad

### AT: Europe Rentrenchment

#### Europe's NATO military can handle Russia alone -- it's more efficient and money-wise than the US.  

**Posen 20**, Ford International Professor of Political Science in the
Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
author of numerous articles and three books, 12-2-2020, (Barry, \"Europe
Can Defend Itself,\" Global Politics and Strategy, 62(6), p. 7-34,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/00396338.2020.1851080>, kav)  

The main security problem for Europe is Russia. We should be curious as
to how Europe's situation could be so bad, given that Europe's main
military inputs -- people and money -- exceed Russia's. [Including
Turkey and Canada, and excluding the US, NATO has nearly 1.9 million
military personnel. Excluding Turkey and Canada, NATO has nearly 1.4m
military personnel.7 Russia has about 900,000 troops in the active
forces, and another 500,000 in paramilitary units, the main purpose of
which is internal security, for a total of 1.4m]{.underline}.8 The
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute assesses that Russia
spent perhaps \$65 billion on defence in 2019, measured at market
exchange rates.9 The non-US NATO members spent roughly \$300bn on
defence that year, about \$280bn without Turkey and Canada. Indeed,
combined German and French defence spending alone is \$100bn, which
exceeds that of Russia. In crude terms, then, [the Europeans
out-resource Russia in military inputs.]{.underline} Furthermore[,
Europe draws its inputs from a much larger and more diverse
base.]{.underline} The pre-Brexit GDP of the EU (which excludes NATO
members Canada, Norway and Turkey, and includes neutrals such as Finland
and Sweden) was about \$16 trillion, compared with Russia's \$1.7trn.
The pre-Brexit population of the EU was 513m, while Russia's is about
145m. Overall, then, [any inability on the part of European members of
NATO to muster the military wherewithal to oppose Russian aggression
involves more than a mere incapacity to allocate sufficient national
resources to the challenge. It would be a defence-management failure of
truly heroic proportions.]{.underline} 

Two reasons are generally offered to explain why Europe would logically
get less for its total defence spending than would a single country.
Firstly, whether counting NATO members or EU members, every European
state has its own defence ministry and its own array of military
headquarters, schools, depots and bases. Given that some of these
countries are quite small, considerable duplication of effort is
plausible. [The superficial evidence does not support the argument that
superfluous European civilian employees are the problem, however. The
ratio of civilians employed by EU ministries of defence to the number of
troops under arms is considerably lower than that of the United States.
The US has 758,000 direct-hire civilians, 1,363,000 active troops and
804,000 reservists. Even if all reservists are included, the ratio of
civilians to military personnel is 0.35. Europe employs 372,000
civilians to manage 1,400,000 troops, for a ratio of 0.25. Thus, by the
numbers, Europe appears to be more efficient at management and support
than the US.10 This may seem off base intuitively, but the similarity in
the ratio of civilians to uniformed personnel is
suggestive.]{.underline} 

Secondly, European spending might yield suboptimal results due to a lack
of standardisation in the acquisition of weaponry and the consequent
loss of scale economies of production. This too seems plausible. A
frequently cited, though methodologically opaque, study by the European
Parliament suggested that in the early part of the last decade,
eliminating such inefficiencies would save \$26bn a year.11
Nevertheless, there is reason to question the extent of Europe's
inefficiency. [European sources are fond of claiming that the Europeans
collectively field 17 different types of main battle tank to the United
States' one.12 This is a false comparison, as it arrays many different
types of European armoured vehicle against only one US
type]{.underline}, the M1 Abrams main battle ank. More tightly comparing
like to like, [European militaries field five types of modern tank,
almost half of them the excellent German-designed and -manufactured
Leopard II tanks.]{.underline}13 Many former members of the Warsaw Pact,
now in NATO, still field some of the Soviet-designed T72s, which are
still widely in service in Russia.14 The same kind of argument is often
advanced with respect to combat aircraft. [Europe is credited with 20
types and the US with six, which again exaggerates the disparity: most
EU combat aircraft are US-designed F16s and European Tornados, Typhoons
and Rafales]{.underline}. And only the latter two were acquired since
the end of the Cold War. Tornados and Typhoons were produced by European
consortia in reasonably long production runs. European military
procurement may be less efficient than the United States' because higher
US spending enables longer production runs. But how much less efficient
is unclear. All modern fighter aircraft are wildly expensive, no matter
where they are produced. [European militaries would doubtless profit
from greater standardisation from the standpoint of both efficient
acquisition and ease of maintenance and supply on the battlefield.
However, these shortfalls seem insufficient to explain the general
pessimism about Europe's autonomous military capabilities.]{.underline} 

 

#### Europe can handle Russia without the US -- their ev doesn't account for Europe's vast types of units.  

**Posen 20**, Ford International Professor of Political Science in the
Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
author of numerous articles and three books, 12-2-2020, (Barry, \"Europe
Can Defend Itself,\" Global Politics and Strategy, 62(6), p. 7-34,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/00396338.2020.1851080>, kav)  

If the IISS front-wide 1.5--2:1 force-ratio heuristic is valid, [NATO
European forces seem competitive]{.underline}. NATO's publicly announced
rapid-reinforcement objective for ground forces is 30 mechanised
battalions in 30 days.38 In Western militaries, this would typically
imply ten brigades. If ten brigades is NATO's official solution to the
Russia problem, and if the IISS heuristic roughly captures the thinking
of NATO planners, then NATO is unlikely to have assessed the plausible
Russian force in theatre as larger than 15 brigades. 

[Changing the mission from offence to defence, however, also permits
NATO Europe to take advantage of the large number of 'light' infantry
units in Western armies]{.underline} (see Table 3). These units
typically have no tanks, and though they can have light armoured
vehicles, these are not well suited to offensive operations. Some are
airborne units, which in most Western armies are considered elite
troops. While these units are often among the readiest in any army,
'Defending Europe' rightly does not count them as useful for the
counter-attack scenario. [Most NATO European armies maintain one or more
additional infantry brigades. Some of these specialise in mountainous
terrain and are considered elite. There are also many infantry brigades
that travel by truck or light armoured vehicle, and fight on foot. For
defensive operations, especially where urban or forested areas are
available for cover and concealment, these units can be effective, even
against mechanised forces. Indeed, they are sometime
preferable]{.underline}.39 Such brigades are not the equal of armoured
brigades in open country, but assigning them half the combat power of
their heavier brethren when fighting defensively on ground of their
choosing seems fair. France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and
the UK collectively have at least another dozen of these types of
brigades.40 If half are assumed ready, then six more brigades are
available to fight, and even [if their combat power is discounted by
another 50%, three brigade equivalents can be added to the NATO total,
bringing the Russia--NATO force ratio down to 14:14, or one to
one.]{.underline} 

Airpower and air defence 

[Whether NATO's objective is to recapture territory taken by Russia, or
to defend Poland, airpower will be a critical element of the
campaign]{.underline}. This has been true of modern ground-force
operations since the advent of combat aircraft early in the First World
War. [Airpower is particularly important in mechanised warfare, in which
the responsiveness of airpower can be a useful counter to the sudden
changes on the battlefield that armoured and mechanised clashes often
produce.]{.underline} This dynamic could prove particularly salient in
any campaign in Eastern Europe under present conditions, because, in
contrast to the Second World War and the Cold War, the ratio of ground
units to space is low, producing a greater possibility of fast-moving
battles of manoeuvre. 

'Defending Europe' uses the same front-wide force-ratio heuristic to
assess European airpower as it does to assess land power. 'All other
things being near equal', say the authors, 'platform numbers around
parity favour the defender strongly. A force structure 50% larger than
that assessed to be currently deployable would offer an uncertain
outcome, while a deployed force double the size of the current estimate
would provide a generally favourable outcome.'41 They cite no source for
this statement and I could find none myself. After counting available
Russian and European aircraft, they conclude that NATO needs an
additional 264 top-quality tactical fighters in combat units to achieve
a 2:1 superiority and thus be able to take the offensive with hope of
success.42 The study offers a narrative about the kind of air operations
that would attend a NATO counter-offensive. Quite rightly, it notes that
they would be complex and demanding, as modern Russian surface-to-air
missile systems are quite good, and Russian forces would be fighting on
their own ground, with hardened and redundant communications systems and
an integrated air-defence system. These assets would need to be
suppressed in order to operate aircraft against ground targets while
avoiding potential losses that could be high enough to scuttle the
operation. If we apply the IISS heuristic that the attacking air force
should outnumber that of the defender by 2:1, [NATO would experience no
shortage of aircraft for a major defensive operation in Poland.
'Defending Europe' credits Russia with roughly 296 combat aircraft, and
NATO with 400, a ratio of 1.35:1 in NATO's favour, which would be
defending]{.underline}.43 By the very criteria of the IISS analysis,
Russian air forces are plainly inadequate to support a ground offensive
deep into Poland. This is not to say that Russia could not attempt such
a ground offensive. Russia has many assets to put in play, including
cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.44 And Russian ground
forces typically drag along with them mobile air-defence assets that
would give NATO's supporting aircraft a tough time. [Nevertheless,
establishing a NATO defensive umbrella over Poland, and employing
tactical aircraft to directly support NATO's ground forces in that
country, are much easier tasks than trying to crack open prepared
Russian air and ground defences in Belarus, Kaliningrad and Lithuania.45
Indeed, NATO's air forces should, in some measure, be able to compensate
for the mobile surface-to-air missile systems largely missing from
NATO's ground forces.]{.underline}46 

### AT: Generic Retrenchment

#### Only retrenchment can solve inter-state conflict in the Middle East -- proven by partial withdrawal under Trump

As the scholars Hal Brands, Steven Cook, and Kenneth Pollack wrote
endorsing [the Carter Doctrine]{.underline} and its continuation, "the
United States established and upheld the basic rules of conduct in the
region: the United States would meet efforts to interfere with the free
flow of oil by force; uphold freedom of navigation; demand that regional
powers give up their irredentist claims on other states or face grave
consequences; and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction." This account is accurate enough (although the last rule on
the list always exempted Israel), but the story glosses over how the
policy also [gave cover to U.S. allies for some fairly destabilizing
behaviors of their own]{.underline}. That's an omission Brands makes in
a Bloomberg article, too, where he points to Saudi Arabia's slaughter of
the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi to argue that a
"post-American Middle East will not be stable and peaceful. It will be
even nastier and more turbulent than it is today." And in the words of
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2018, "If it weren't for the United States,
they'd be speaking Farsi in about a week in Saudi Arabia." All this
without a nod to the fact that, if anything, [the United States'
protection of the Saudi regime has enabled its promotion of terrorism
and its destabilizing activities in the region, which have, in turn,
prompted further Iranian response.]{.underline} Assertions about the
United States' pivotal role in the Middle East, no matter how often
repeated, have not been proved true. Iran, ravaged by sanctions,
corruption, and economic mismanagement, is nowhere near establishing
hegemony in the region. Saudi Arabia spends more than five times as much
on its military than does Iran; the entire Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC)---Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and the
UAE---outspends Iran by a factor of eight. Meanwhile, whereas [Iran has
no nuclear weapons yet undergoes more inspections than any other
country, Israel has a nuclear weapons program with no international
transparency whatsoever.]{.underline} Iran may have been adept at taking
advantage of U.S. overextension and missteps in the last few decades,
but establishing hegemony is a different matter altogether. Further,
[the region did not fall into deeper chaos as a result of Trump's
earlier refusal to get into a shooting war with Iran after attacks by
Iranian proxies against Saudi oil installations in September
2019.]{.underline} Critics lamented the president's decision as an
abandonment of the Carter Doctrine, calling it a disaster for the GCC
and warning that it may even prompt Saudi Arabia to seek nuclear
weapons. [Recognizing that the U.S. military was no longer at their
disposal, Saudi Arabia and the UAE began exercising the diplomatic
options that had always been available to them.]{.underline} Instead,
recognizing that the U.S. military was no longer at their disposal,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE began exercising the diplomatic options that
had always been available to them. For its part[, Saudi Arabia stepped
up direct talks with Houthi rebels in Yemen as a way to ease tensions
with their backer, Iran.]{.underline} [The level of violence on both
sides declined as a result, and more than 100 prisoners of war were
released. In November, the United Nations' Yemen envoy, Martin
Griffiths, reported an 80 percent reduction in Saudi-led airstrikes, and
there were no Yemeni deaths in the previous two weeks.]{.underline}
Recognizing that the U.S. military was no longer at their disposal,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE began exercising the diplomatic options that
had always been available to them. [Riyadh also opted to reduce tensions
with Qatar, a former ally that had become a nemesis. T]{.underline}he
Saudi government seemingly ordered its notorious Twitter army to tone
down the insults against Qatar and its emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani,
and some sporting events between the two countries resumed, according to
the New York Times. [Saudi officials also claimed that they had quietly
reached out to Iran via intermediaries seeking ways to ease tensions.
Tehran, in turn, welcomed the prospective Saudi-Qatari thaw and,
according to the New York Times, floated a peace plan based on a mutual
Iranian-Saudi pledge of nonaggression.]{.underline} An even stronger
change of heart occurred in Abu Dhabi. In July, [the UAE started
withdrawing troops from Yemen. The same month, it participated in direct
talks with Tehran to discuss maritime security. It even released \$700
million in funds to Iran in contradiction to the Trump administration's
maximum pressure strategy.]{.underline} Some of these measures may have
been more tactical than strategic. Saudi Arabia may have reduced
tensions with Qatar and the Houthis in order to better situate itself
for a confrontation with Tehran down the road or to offset international
condemnation of its killing of Khashoggi, human rights abuses at home,
and brutal tactics in Yemen. The UAE, too, may have felt that a tactical
reduction of tensions was warranted. Nevertheless, [as the United States
appeared poised to back out of the region, its erstwhile allies'
calculations tilted toward diplomacy. The Saudis and Emiratis simply had
no choice but to cease some of their recklessness because they could no
longer operate under the protection of the United States. If stability
in the Middle East is the United States' main goal, Washington should
have celebrated rather than bemoaned these developments.]{.underline} In
the wake of the U.S. assassination of Suleimani---which some former U.S.
officials have called an act of war---the calculations may change once
more. According to Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi, Suleimani was
in Iraq to bring him Tehran's response to a message from Riyadh on how
to defuse regional tensions, presumably as part of the House of Saud's
renewed interest in diplomacy. The Iraqis, according to him, were
mediating between the two rivals, an initiative that has now been thrown
into question[. Iran may very well conclude, rightly or wrongly, that
Saudi Arabia and the UAE conspired with Washington to assassinate
Suleimani and as a result not only end the recent diplomacy but also
target Riyadh and Abu Dhabi as part of the revenge for Suleimani's
death. This is yet one more instance, it seems, in which U.S. activities
in the region have brought more turmoil than stability.]{.underline} To
be sure, there is no guarantee that recent diplomatic efforts would have
been successful. A more responsible Riyadh might not have begotten a
more responsible Tehran. But it is noteworthy that diplomacy did not
even begin in earnest until Washington clearly demonstrated its
unwillingness to entangle itself in a war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
And by returning to the region in a show of military force, Trump may
once again disincentivize the United States' allies from taking
diplomacy seriously. They may even interpret Suleimani's killing as a
license to resume their recklessness---activities like Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman's purported kidnapping of the Lebanese prime
minister and ordering of the dismemberment of Khashoggi; Saudi Arabia
and the UAE's imposition of a blockade on Qatar; and the two countries'
further destabilization of Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, and Yemen. As
in the past, in other words, it seems as if the Middle East's descent
into chaos is more likely with the United States than without it. 

#### Only retrenchment can avoid the worst effects of US hegemonic collapse 

**Paul 20 --** has a M.A. in English from Jadavpur University and is the
senior editor at Open Magazine, 2/21/20 (Sudeep, "Who's Afraid of Pax
Americana?", Open Magazine,

The backdrop to American power is now this re-emerging world island. And
[in a time when the US is largely seen to be 'in decline', even by the
American public (a March 2019 Pew Survey said that 60 per cent of
Americans think the US' stature in the world will shrink over the next
30 years), what matters, as much for America as for the world, is the
choices Washington makes in the near future.]{.underline} In Twilight of
the Titans: Great Power Decline and Retrenchment (2018), Paul K
MacDonald and Joseph M Parent, analysing the cases of Britain, France
and Russia, contend that '[declining states perform comparatively well
in militarized disputes'.]{.underline} But their most significant find
is that, when in decline, ['states that retrench recover their prior
rank with some regularity, but those that fail to retrench never
do'.]{.underline} This can be explained by understanding the truism that
what matters is not a state's own trajectory but 'how the trajectory
changes its position relative to others'. [Retrenchment is the commonest
response to decline and it reduces costs. A retrenching great power
switches to a foreign policy 'less active, less ambitious, and less
burdensome'. In this line of argument, challenging theories of grand
strategy and war, the 'biggest danger may not be the impending
Sino-American transition itself, but the widespread belief that it makes
war more likely'.]{.underline} So, how does Donald Trump's withdrawal
from Syria square with the assassination of Qassem Soleimani or the
Middle East peace plan? To understand US foreign policy in the Trump
era, a medium-term background is necessary. The most significant
breakthrough for Cold War US foreign policy was under the arch-realist
Richard Nixon and his National Security Advisor-cum-Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger when the détente with China was established. Ronald
Reagan, not a realist in the Nixon mould, reacting to Jimmy Carter's
shock at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the bungling of the
Iranian hostage crisis, abandoned the Nixon-era caution and got away
with it. But two things still took America by surprise: the fall of the
Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. That
surprise, however, soon led to elation and the brief return to realism
evidenced in the George HW Bush presidency (who built a coalition of 39
states to eject Iraq from Kuwait and limited the war's objectives) was
replaced by [the pursuit of what has been called 'liberal
hegemony'.]{.underline} Building on the Cold War's culture war,
combining hard and soft power through institutions and individuals, this
[was American foreign policy at its most ambitious and arrogant and it
made the three presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack
Obama a continuum, notwithstanding the divergences in detail. Under
Clinton, the US sought to remake post-Soviet Russia in America's
image---economically, culturally and politically. The failure was
epic.]{.underline} In a March 2018 essay in American Affairs, former
State Department Russia advisor James Carden wrote: 'The failure of this
project has contributed to the present animus towards Russia and
continues to hinder more reasonable diplomatic relations.' This was a
long way from George F Kennan's 1947 article in Foreign Affairs with
which America's Cold War foreign policy had begun, an article that had
called for a firm containment of the Soviet Union, not motivated
ideologically but strategically. Managing the post-Cold War was
America's second failure on the world stage (bigger than the hot war in
Vietnam). In 1992, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had stopped a military
modernisation plan, the need for which was felt soon after.
Nevertheless, America did not retrench after the Soviet collapse. In The
Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities (2018),
political scientist John J Mearsheimer battles for a new realism because
'\[l\]iberal states have a crusader mentality hardwired into them that
is hard to maintain'. But while he proposes a policy of restraint,
Mearsheimer is an 'offensive realist' as opposed to 'defensive realists'
who want to have nothing to do with hegemony. MacDonald and Parent might
counter the assumption of defensive realism that a hegemonic power would
sooner or later be reduced by a coalition of its rivals, because what
matters is the relative trajectory of the declining state. But to extend
the idea, even if it somewhat contradicts their thesis on retrenchment,
it could also be argued that a reduction in the defence budget and
curtailing alliance engagements would not reduce the risks for America.
[Mearsheimer's belief that 'a foreign policy based on realism is likely
to be less warlike than one based on liberalism' was nearly proved by
Nixon but while the offensive realist finds the defensive realist
proposal of mere 'offshore balancing' inadequate and dangerous, there is
agreement that the US needs to abandon the crusading liberal hegemony in
place since the Clinton years.]{.underline}

According to LIO theorists, the order is characterized by hierarchy, not
anarchy---that is[, the lack of an international institution or state
that can prevent the use of military force and enforce international
agreements.]{.underline} In the international relations theory
literature, hierarchy has a variety of meanings and logics. [The **LIO
is grounded in** a narrow conception of the term: **hierarchy** is
manifest in legitimate political authority between superordinate and
subordinate states]{.underline}.[23](javascript:;) John Ikenberry
explains that in hierarchical systems, "order is established or imposed
by a leading state wielding concentrated power and authority ...
hierarchical orders can vary widely in terms of the degree to which
superordinate and subordinate roles are established and maintained by
such factors as coercive power, legitimate authority, institutionalized
relations, and a division of labor."[[24](javascript:;) In a liberal
hegemonic order, legitimate authority plays a large role, whereas
coercion plays a limited role.]{.underline} The legitimacy of the most
powerful state reflects its willingness to rely on bargaining to achieve
consensus.[25](javascript:;) [**The LIO is built on negotiated rule**s
that all states, including the most powerful state, accept.
Consequently, **the weaker states consider the most powerful state\'s
overwhelming influence** in establishing the terms of the consensus **to
be legitimate**.[26](javascript:;) Accordingly, **the weaker states are
less likely** to **try to overturn the agreement or regime**, which
increases the most powerful state\'s prospects for maintaining its
position over the long run. Nevertheless, **the structural relationship
between the states is hierarchical,** **because the most powerful state
disproportionately influences the terms** of the agreement.]{.underline}
David Lake offers a different understanding of hierarchy, based on a
concept of "relational authority." He states that "in a relational
approach, authority is understood to rest on an exchange relationship
between dominant and subordinate states, in which the former provides a
social order in return for compliance and legitimacy from the
latter."[27](javascript:;) [Legitimacy conferred by the subordinate
(weaker) power to the superordinate (stronger) power distinguishes the
product of relational authority from standard bargained
agreements.]{.underline} Central to Lake\'s understanding of legitimacy
is duty: "It is the duty to comply with the ruler\'s commands---or
alternatively the legitimacy of those commands---that renders authority
and coercion conceptually distinct."[28](javascript:;)

## Offshore Balancing

### 2NC\-\--Generic\-\--Ext: Offshore Balancing Good

#### Offshore balancing is empirically proven to be successful -- past instances of onshoring have only ended in failure

**Walt '20 -- Professor of International Affairs** \[Stephen; STEPHEN M.
WALT is Robert and Renée Belfer Professor of International Affairs at
the Harvard Kennedy School; 5-5-20; \" The United States Forgot Its
Strategy for Winning Cold Wars?";
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/05/offshore-balancing-cold-war-china-us-grand-strategy/;
Foreign Affairs; accessed 7-7-2022; AH\]

Gady's article is an interesting historical narrative, and it reminds us
that U.S. strategy in the early Cold War was not preordained. But like
other contemporary critics of offshore balancing, Gady does not fully
grasp the underlying logic behind this strategy. As a result, [he
mistakenly believes that Cold War containment was at odds with offshore
balancing. This is wrong: Containment during the Cold War was a clear
application of **offshore balancing's** central principles.]{.underline}
Gady's account portrays offshore balancing as something of a halfway
house between true isolationism---the position long identified with Taft
that he had abandoned by the early 1950s---and the policy of containment
that the United States pursued throughout the Cold War. [This view is
clearly reflected in his claim that "\[a\]t the core, an offshore
balancing strategy for the United States means maintaining regional
hegemony in the Western hemisphere while maintaining a balance of power
in Asia and Europe, chiefly through allied nations buoyed by U.S.
military aid, thus preventing any other great power from dominating
these geo-strategically important regions" (my emphasis). This
description might sound correct at first glance, but Gady misses an
essential feature of the strategy: Whether the United States can safely
remain offshore depends on the configuration of power in the
"geo-strategically important region" in question.]{.underline} Although
the United States may be able to rely on "allied nations buoyed by U.S.
military aid" in some circumstances, this policy is not possible if the
states in the relevant region are too weak to balance a potential
hegemon on their own. Under these conditions, [an offshore balancer must
commit its own power---including its own military forces---in that key
region to ensure that no single power is able to **dominate and control
it.** This principle explains why Britain---the original offshore
balancer---sent its own troops onto the European continent against
Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany and its allies, Nazi Germany, and
the Soviet Union. The United States acted similarly in the **two world
wars** and in the **Cold War** too. This prescription follows directly
from offshore balancing's core logic.]{.underline} It is a realist
strategy, which views a favorable distribution of hard power (economic
capacity, scientific prowess, military strength, etc.) as the primary
source of U.S. national security. [Spreading democracy, building
institutions, expanding trade, etc., may be worthy goals in their own
right and can sometimes help at the margin, but at the end of the day
U.S. security is determined largely by the balance of power in areas of
**critical strategic importance.** This belief was the basis for
Manifest Destiny and the Monroe Doctrine, policies that eventually
established the United States as the only great power in the Western
Hemisphere. By expanding across North America and driving the European
powers out, the United States was able to keep dangerous adversaries at
a distance, thereby maximizing its own security and freedom of
action.]{.underline} Every other major power has either been invaded or
suffered sustained attacks at home on one or more occasions during the
past 200 years---but not the United States. [Being the world's only
regional hegemon has not only made Americans safer. It eventually made
it possible for them to intervene abroad without having to worry much
about defending their own soil.]{.underline} Since becoming a great
power, the United States has also sought to prevent any other great
power from singlehandedly dominating Europe, East Asia, or the Persian
Gulf. These regions are important because Europe and East Asia are the
key centers of industrial power, while the Gulf is the source of much of
the oil and gas that fuels the world economy. Were any single country
able to dominate Europe or East Asia, it might eventually control
greater economic resources than the United States and be able to outpace
it in an arms race. That superpower might form alliances with other
countries in the Western Hemisphere and bring its own power to bear
close to the U.S. homeland. Similarly, a hostile hegemon in the Persian
Gulf (or an outside great power that moved into and dominated that
region) might be able to manipulate oil supplies in ways that could
damage the U.S. economy. Preventing a hegemon from emerging in these key
regions provides an additional benefit: It ensures that the major powers
in Eurasia will tend to worry more about each other than about the
United States. As a result, some of these states are usually eager for
U.S. support and thus more willing to do Washington's bidding. For all
of these reasons, it makes good sense for the United States to maintain
a dominant position in the Western Hemisphere and help prevent another
great power from establishing a similar position in its own
neighborhood. Several implications follow directly from this logic.
[First, the proper role and size of the U.S. national security
establishment depend on the distribution of power in the key regions. If
there is no potential hegemon in sight, there is **little reason to
deploy U.S. ground or air forces** in distant areas and less need for a
military establishment that far outstrips those of the other great
powers. The United States should still maintain a first-class military
and keep a watchful eye on developments around the world, but it **does
not need to garrison much of the planet** or use force to spread liberal
principles far and wide If a potential hegemon does appear, the United
States should rely on local forces in the threatened region as the first
line of defense, calibrating its support for these local actors with the
level of the challenge and their own capabilities.]{.underline} If these
regional states cannot contain a potential hegemon on their own, then
the United States must commit its own military power to the region to
make sure the potential hegemon cannot overawe and dominate its
neighbors while at the same time making sure that its local partners
bear a fair share of the costs of containment. [During the Cold War, the
essential features of **containment followed this basic logic
perfectly**. U.S. leaders did not believe that the local powers in
Europe or East Asia could stand up to the Soviet challenge on their own,
which is why Washington deployed substantial U.S. forces to these
critical regions in peacetime.]{.underline} Of course, it might have
been preferable in the abstract for the United States to pass the buck
to others, but the distribution of power in Europe and Asia at the time
made buck-passing infeasible. There was no potential hegemon in the
Persian Gulf, however, and the Soviet Union did not seriously threaten
to invade that region during the Cold War. [Nevertheless, to maintain
the local balance of power and limit Soviet influence, the **United
States relied on Britain** (until the mid-1960s) and on local clients
such as Iran. After the Shah of Iran was overthrown in 1979 and Iran
became an adversary, Washington created the Rapid Deployment Force. But
it kept this force offshore and over the horizon and did not send
significant forces into the region until Iraq seized Kuwait in 1990.
This clear and obvious threat to the regional balance of power led the
United States to organize a large coalition---in which its own forces
played the predominant role---to expel Iraq from Kuwait. This operation
was fully consistent with offshore balancing: The first Gulf War was an
occasion when it made sense for the United States to go
"onshore."]{.underline} Most importantly, [whenever the United States
has abandoned offshore balancing and pursued a different strategy, the
results have invariably been **disastrous**.]{.underline} The [Vietnam
War was not consistent with offshore balancing]{.underline}, for
example, because, as realist critics such as Walter Lippmann, Hans
Morgenthau, and Kenneth Waltz emphasized, Indochina was not a vital
strategic region and its fate could not alter the global balance of
power in any meaningful way. [The Clinton administration's adoption of
"dual containment" in the Gulf and the recent U.S. wars in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and Libya were also misguided departures from offshore
balancing, as they had little to do with maintaining a favorable balance
of power. Indeed, in the case of Iraq, it shattered the local balance in
the Persian Gulf to the benefit of Iran]{.underline}.

#### Switching to offshore balancing is the best way to remedy current foreign policy issues and prevent war

American Engagement Initiative at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft

Both approaches to the world are still problematic. A [rebooted liberal
internationalism may succeed at rehabilitating the United States' image,
but it is unlikely to advance democracy or build a unified liberal order
through nonmilitary means when military ones have failed. And as the
global balance of power shifts, liberal internationalism simultaneously
overestimates the contributions that U.S. allies can make to collective
defense and underestimates the differences they have with
Washington.]{.underline} The "America first" approach, for its part, may
yield short-term dividends---Trump, after all, was able to force U.S.
allies to abide by sanctions on Iran and renegotiate the North American
Free Trade Agreement---but it has diminishing returns. [The more the
United States uses coercive tools against other countries, the more they
will look for ways to blunt those tools. And both approaches lean
heavily on a forward U.S. military presence in ways that could all too
easily **trigger** an unplanned **conflict**, particularly in Asia. The
remaining alternative, **restraint**, comes from outside the Washington
policymaking world and is largely focused on these
**flaws**.]{.underline} It is far more ideologically diverse than the
other two, but most restrainers agree on several core principles. They
share a conviction that the United States is a remarkably secure nation,
that unlike many great powers in history, it faces no real threat of
invasion, thanks to geography and nuclear weapons. [They argue that U.S.
foreign policy has been characterized in recent years by overreach and
hubris, with predictably abysmal results. And they think U.S. foreign
policy is overmilitarized, with policymakers spending too much on
defense and too quickly resorting to force. Most important, advocates of
restraint strike directly at the notion of the United States as the
indispensable nation, considering it instead as but one among many
global powers.]{.underline} RESTRAINT'S MOMENT The most common slap at
restrainers is that they focus too much on criticism without offering
plausible policy alternatives. That is not an entirely accurate
evaluation; individual proponents of restraint have offered detailed
prescriptions for everything from the war in Afghanistan to U.S.-Russian
relations. But it is true that restrainers have often focused on what
draws them together---namely, their shared criticisms of the status
quo---rather than what would pull them apart: the question of which
specific policies to implement instead. As restraint enters the
mainstream conversation, the distinctions within this group are coming
to the surface. [Restraint contains several different overlapping
ideas.]{.underline} The first (and best defined) of these is an academic
theory of grand strategy formulated by the political scientist Barry
Posen in his 2014 book, Restraint. His version of restraint envisages a
much smaller military based primarily within the United States. [Other
restrainers---such as the international relations theorists John
Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt---advocate a grand strategy of **offshore
balancing**, a distinct but related approach that also calls for
downsizing the United States' global military role. (The distinction
between the two is one of degree: Posen backs an entirely offshore
military presence, whereas Mearsheimer and Walt admit that the United
States may occasionally need to intervene to keep a hostile state from
dominating a key region.) As grand strategies, both leave many granular
policy details unstated, but they present **internally coherent** and
**fully formulated** approaches to the world.]{.underline} There is also
a looser definition of "restraint." Increasingly, the term is Washington
shorthand for any proposal for a less militarized and activist foreign
policy. That includes those put forth not just by academic realists but
also by progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans in Congress,
as well as various antiwar groups (such as Code Pink and the Friends
Committee on National Legislation) and newer entrants into the antiwar
space (such as the veterans' group Common Defense). Thus, the term
"restraint" is now used as often to signify this broader political
movement as it is to describe a grand strategy. Any movement that
includes Mearsheimer and Code Pink is by necessity a big tent, and
indeed, there are many motivations for restraint. For some, it might be
a moral consideration: many libertarians believe that [war grows the
state, and anti-imperialists want to rein in what they see as an
overbearing military-industrial complex. For others, the motivation is
financial: although conservative deficit hawks are far less vocal on
defense than on other issues, they exist, and many progressives and even
some mainstream Democrats view cuts to military spending as an easy way
to **free up resources** for infrastructure or social programs. For
others in the restraint community, it is personal: some of the recent
activism around ending the **war on terrorism** has been driven by
veterans who are concerned about what the conflict has done to their
fellow soldiers and to American society writ large. Then there are the
strategists, for whom the pursuit of restraint is largely about
**avoiding the failures** and risks of the current
approach.]{.underline} There are even those who might be called
"restraint-curious," people who are open to a more restrained foreign
policy on specific issues but reject the broader notion.

### 2NC\-\--China\-\--Offshore Balancing Good

#### Offshore balancing checks Chinese revisionism -- it helps redirect resources to enable effective US containment

The situation in Asia is dramatically different. [China is a potential
hegemon in Asia, and it will remain one long after the COVID-19 pandemic
is behind us. Although Asia contains a number of capable medium-sized
powers, such as Japan, South Korea, and India, it will not be easy for
them to form an effective balancing coalition.]{.underline} In this
case, the United States needs to coordinate this effort and commit its
own forces. Buck-passing will not work. [Although U.S. military forces
will have to be onshore in a number of places in Asia, this policy is
still **fully consistent with the grand strategy of offshore
balancing.**]{.underline} To be sure, preventing China from establishing
regional hegemony in Asia cannot stop Beijing from trying to build
influence through its Belt and Road Initiative or stop it from engaging
in other efforts to expand its diplomatic reach. [But it would help
limit Chinese influence by maintaining an active U.S. presence in Asia
and forcing China to focus most of its attention closer to home. By
reducing the U.S. commitment to Europe and ending its costly military
involvements in the Middle East, **offshore balancing would also free up
resources** that will be needed to meet a future Chinese challenge, a
problem that may be increasingly acute in the post-coronavirus fiscal
environment.]{.underline} Why is it a problem when people misrepresent
offshore balancing? Because we are finally having a serious and long
overdue debate about the proper grand strategy for the United States.
[The **stakes are high**, as the many failures that flowed from liberal
hegemony---the flawed grand strategy that U.S. leaders pursued during
the unipolar moment---make clear. Protagonists often try to win policy
debates by distorting their opponents' views, by falsely associating
their own recommendations with past successes, and by denying any
responsibility for repeated failures. Deciding which strategic options
should guide U.S. policy in the future depends first and foremost on a
proper understanding of the different alternatives. An accurate
understanding of **offshore balancing** will reveal that it provided the
foundation most of America's foreign-**policy successes**, while
departures from that strategy lie at the root of some of the **country's
biggest missteps.**]{.underline}

## Multipolarity 

### Multipolarity is Peaceful 

#### Multipolarity is the only way to ensure world peace. Pursuing hegemony is detrimental, emboldening aggression and chaos. 

**Köchler, PhD, 17**

(Hans, professor of philosophy at the University of Innsbruck, Austria,
Peace in a multipolar world, April 20,

http://hanskoechler.com/Koechler-Peace-Multipolar-World-Current_Concerns_2017-25-07.pdf)

[Multipolarity: **power parallelogram of peace**]{.underline}? Perhaps
we should pause here briefly and make sure we understand the nature of
order in relations between states. In the era of globalization, it is an
ever more complex system of interaction and dependence on different
levels. As a multidimensional framework of interaction, including the
economic, political, socio-cultural and military dimensions, it is
dynamic from the outset. It exists in no other than the dynamic form. In
this sense, the stability of world order is always to be understood as
relative. Stability sensu stricto is an unattainable ideal. The
respective world order is a parallelogram of forces that results from
the complex interaction of the interests of state actors and -- in our
increasingly globalized world -- non-state actors alike. This
necessarily implies a perpetual struggle for influence, in fact a
struggle for power that results from the collective will of the citizens
of all states. As I have indicated earlier, this collective will is not
per se ethically motivated -- oriented, for example, at the principle of
mutuality, or mutual respect. Rather, it is guided by the natural
pursuit of advantage, aimed towards the benefits the respective
governments promise their citizens in order to legitimize their rule.
Whether we like it or not, the reality of international relations is
such that normative considerations are of secondary importance. [Only
when more and more people become aware that the **reckless pursuit of
interests** by each state, acting in isolation, is ultimately
**detrimental** to all, will normative ideas gain traction.]{.underline}
Acknowledging the constraints of realpolitik, but without giving up on
the ideal, one thus might be resigned to the wisdom of "better late than
never." [The aspect of **mutuality is essential** for international law
as well. Mutuality is, above all, the normative foundation of the
**sovereign equality** of states. Philosophically speaking, the
principle of sovereign equality can, in theory, also be derived from the
**universal validity of human rights.** In actual fact, however, the
continually changing world order, centered on the state as sovereign
agent, is the result of the articulation and assertion of interests by a
multitude of actors and on multiple levels.]{.underline} It is not a
deliberately created system of inter-state relations based on rules on
the normative validity of which all would agree. If this were the case,
the history of conflicts would have come to an end with the entry into
force of the United Nations Charter in 1945. [Since its very foundation,
the ultimate goal of the world organisation has been the safeguarding of
world peace.]{.underline} According to the binding norms and strict
procedural rules of the Charter, especially the provisions of collective
security under Chapter VII, a state of peace should thus have prevailed
from this point onwards. It is also an undeniable fact that world order
is often the result of a war which reconfigures, or redefines, global
power relations, at least for a certain time. The creation of the League
of Nations after the First and the United Nations Organization after the
Second World War are testimony of this. Both organizations came into
existence as result of global armed conflict, and their statutes
reflected -- resp. reflect -- the power constellation after the
preceding war. With regard to the UN, this notably applies to the veto
privilege of the five states that were the victorious powers of World
War II. Writing that privilege into the organisation's Charter (Article
27),6 they aimed to eternalise the position of power they enjoyed at the
time, trying, as it were, "to stop time." (The Charter cannot be amended
without the consent of those states.) However, the actors, as ambitious
as they may be, here too have come to the bitter realization -- I say
this not without irony -- that time cannot be brought to a halt. Today's
power constellation is no longer that of 1945. The community of states
has entered a phase of radical change, indeed global interregnum. The
transition from a unipolar to a multipolar order has become more and
more obvious -- as "unintended consequence" of an unrestrained, often
militarily enforced, assertion of power. Collective security in a
multipolar world In these times of global change, the United Nations
Charter might gain new relevance nevertheless: namely as normative
framework, or body of rules, for the emerging multipolar balance of
power. [The UN system of collective security could well serve as a
**blueprint of a future order of peace**.]{.underline} However, progress
in that direction will only be possible if the structure of the Security
Council is adapted to the new realities. Vested with almost unlimited
powers, the supreme executive organ of the UN -- of which Hans
Morgenthau spoke as the "Holy Alliance" of our time -- is indeed
construed along the lines of a multipolar balance of power. The five
veto-wielding permanent members were meant to hold each other in check
in all decisions on the maintenance or restoration of peace. The Charter
of the United Nations does not provide a framework for unipolar rule,
but embodies the multipolar constellation of 1945, with the five great
powers of the time as permanent members (United States, France, Great
Britain, China \[initially: Republic of China\], Soviet Union \[now:
Russia\]). Because of the veto, the Council is only able to act on the
basis of consensus among those states between which there should ideally
exist a balance of power. This was the expectation of the founders of
the organization in the final phase of the Second World War. In the
course of the Cold War, however, the multipolar architecture of the
Charter became outdated rather quickly. The development of military
technology led to an arms race between the United States and the Soviet
Union. This resulted in a bipolar balance of power between these two
antagonists, which, in turn, meant the marginalisation of the role of
the other permanent members and, ultimately, a paralysis of the Security
Council due to the mutual blockage of these two veto-wielding states.
What was conceived in 1945, albeit with different intention (for the
sake of perpetuating the power constellation of the moment), is,
nonetheless, still relevant today. [" Peace between a multitude of
sovereign actors, i.e. in a multipolar framework, can **only be secured
cooperatively** and **not through** an unrestrained **competition for
power** and privilege.]{.underline} This is, I believe, the essence of
the system of collective security according to Chapter VII of the UN
Charter. [Decisions on the maintenance of peace, i.e. the enforcement of
the prohibition of the threat or use of force between states, must be
reached by way of unanimity between the permanent members.]{.underline}
The real meaning of the "veto" -- a word nowhere to be found in the
Charter -- is consensus among the most powerful states who bear special
responsibility because they possess the means of enforcement. 7 In
statutory terms, the veto is certainly not about bolstering an agenda of
power politics in the interest of each of the permanent members. In
order not to create false hopes, one must emphasize here that the rule
that prescribes unanimity among the permanent members in matters of
collective security only makes sense if a party to a dispute is obliged
to abstain from voting. This is not the case under the present statute.
(Most observers of international affairs are not in any way aware of
it.) According to the Charter, a permanent member that launches
aggression against another country can prevent a decision of the Council
in this matter by simply vetoing it. Would the basic legal principle of
bias be ignored in such a way at the domestic level, any person having
committed a violation of the law could be judge in his own cause.
Whichever way you look at it, this is actually the case under the
decision-making rules of the UN, according to the wording of Article 27
of the Charter.8 The idealists who expect nothing but good of the UN
easily tend to overlook the so-called fine print in the text of the
Charter. After all, the UN is not as perfect as one would wish it to be
-- and it never will be, even if the provisions of the Charter were
implemented up to the last comma. Because of the dictates of power
politics, the text contains serious normative contradictions that
undermine the very system that the UN is supposed to promote.9 In view
of this systemic inconsistency it is of particular importance that the
Charter -- reflecting the power balance between the victors of World War
II -- should be adapted to the newly emerging multipolar constellation.
[The development towards multipolarity has become more and more apparent
in the wake of the regional crises we mentioned earlier; for the time
being at least, it is not a result of World War III. One can only hope
that this will remain so in the future.]{.underline} The adaptation of
the Charter would mean that decisions of the Security Council on the
maintenance or restoration of peace are reached on the basis of
consensus among the global regions. [In a multipolar world it will no
longer be possible to **exclude entire continents** -- Africa, Latin
America, Southeast Asia -- from the decision-making
processes.]{.underline} Should this continue to be the case, systemic
instability in the emerging multipolar framework will further increase
and the United Nations Organization will, so to speak, abolish itself,
i.e. make itself obsolete. Accordingly, the United Nations Organization
must undertake a process of reform that will give regional
intergovernmental organizations the status of permanent members in the
Security Council. Possible candidates would be the African Union or the
European Union (the latter replacing France and the United Kingdom as
state members). If one were to keep the veto rule, decisions on war and
peace, i.e. coercive measures under Chapter VII of the Charter,
including the use of armed force, would have to be taken by way of
consensus among the global regions. Such a procedure might also better
protect the interests of a weaker state party, being part of a larger
regional grouping, in a bilateral confrontation with another state,
whether within or outside that grouping. Whatever the system of
intergovernmental rules or procedures may be, one has to admit that
[genuine peace cannot be established by **executive fiat**. In
conformity with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations
Charter, orientation towards the **consensus principle is decisive**. It
is also more realistic in a multipolar framework than in a unipolar one
where stability is achieved by pressure and coercion.]{.underline}

[Cooperative Multipolarity is **Achievable**]{.underline} Former US
National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski has spoken of the current
geopolitical configuration as one without historic precedent, with [none
of the three top military powers in a position to assume a hegemonic
role.]{.underline} In this respect Simon Reich and Richard Ned Lebow
(2014, 183) correctly point out that "ultimately, [**hegemony** is
**difficult to reconcile with democracy**".]{.underline} It is
undeniable that in the emerging multipolar configuration of power
divergent agendas and world views will continue to collide and could
well lead to open hostility and destructive competition. [But it is also
true that cooperative, and increasingly inclusive forms of interaction
are happening every day on important, unifying issues, through
multilateral arrangements which -- although described as "American led"
by some -- in reality reflect an evolutionary path paved with the
**engaged** **participation** of many nations large and small.
Cooperative multipolarity is therefore achievable and can be seen as the
next, **more** **democratic** and just stage in the evolutionary path of
the international system. Important achievements, brought about
through]{.underline} the active leadership of the victors of [World War
II, provide a **firm foundation** for our future efforts. These include
the ruling out of the use of military force, except in situations of
self-defense or in accordance with specific multilateral authorization,
respect for the universality of human rights, as well as compliance with
a vast body of international law establishing rights and
obligations]{.underline} in a wide range of topics -- from trade,
finance and social justice, to health, education and culture. Of the
three "pillars" that compose the triad of the UN's field of activity --
namely, development, human rights, peace and security -- it is possible
to affirm that a process of modernization and adaptation to new
contemporary realities has been successfully advancing with respect to
the first two. Such is the meaning of the universally applicable 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted in 2015; such is the sense of
the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council created ten
years ago. In the peace and security realm, however, there is
considerable room for improvement. But the situation is not hopeless.
The militarism of the first years of the 21st century has come to
illustrate the limitations of the use of force to confront new
challenges posed by violent extremism conducive to terrorism, opening
opportunities for cooperation on prevention. [An effective combination
of multilateral and bilateral diplomacy has produced **constructive
outcomes** in dealing with **thorny issues** such as the **Iranian
nuclear file.**]{.underline}

#### Layne was right---US primacy failing new strategy is necessary

Where I suspect that **[Layne and I might agree is on the need for a new
American strategy]{.underline}** in a world marked by "the rise of the
rest." We should learn from the prudence of Dwight Eisenhower. [The
number-one power **does not have to man every boundary** and be strong
everywhere. The attempt]{.underline} to do so [would violate Ike\'s
prudence in resisting direct intervention]{.underline} on the side of
the French in Vietnam in 1954. Also relevant today is Ike\'s conviction
that it is essential to preserve the strength of the American economy to
undergird our military strength. Applied to today\'s world, an Ike-like
strategy would avoid involvement of ground forces in major wars on the
Asian continent, even if there was not a fiscal deficit.
Counterinsurgency is attractive as a military doctrine in the way that
it pays careful attention to the tactical balancing of hard and soft
power, but in a strategic sense, it should not lead us into imperial
occupation of weak states and "nation building" in places that are
beyond our limits. The maxim of avoiding major land wars in Asia or
other poor countries does not mean withdrawing a forward military
presence from places like Japan and Korea, or ending military assistance
of various types to countries like Pakistan or Egypt. Some analysts call
this a strategy of "[off-shore balancing]{.underline}," but that term
must mean more than just naval and air force activity. An [American land
presence that is welcome and supported by allies should not be ruled out
by a slogan.]{.underline} Eisenhower also understood the limits of what
is possible in terms of American domestic institutions and public
attitudes. The British historian Niall Ferguson, an enthusiast for
empire, lamented at the time of the Iraq War that the United States
lacked the capacity for empire because of three domestic deficits:
manpower (not enough boots on the ground); attention (not enough public
support for long-term occupation); and financial (not enough savings and
not enough taxation relative to public expenditure). He was correct. A
stomach for empire or colonial occupation is one of the important ways
in which American political culture differs from that of imperial
Britain. Whether worthy of applause or lament, such are our domestic
limits. At the same time, [universalistic values are also in the nature
of our political culture, but we often promote these values best by
being]{.underline} what Ronald Reagan called ["**a shining city on a

### Kagan

#### Robert Kagan is a warmonger and wrong about Ukraine 

**Bacevich 22 -** is Professor Emeritus of International Relations and
History at Boston University. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy,
and received his PhD in American Diplomatic History from Princeton
University, 4/13/22 (Andrew J, "Robert Kagan's Selective Memory", *The
American Conservative*,
<https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/robert-kagans-selective-memory/>,
accessed 6/26/22)//jd 

In the pages of Foreign Affairs, the indefatigable Robert Kagan recently
weighed in with yet another fervent appeal on behalf of empire. Ever the
true-blue American, Kagan avoids using the offensive E-word, of course.
He favors the term hegemony, which, he explains, is benign, involving
neither domination nor exploitation but willing submission---"more a
condition than a purpose." Scratch the surface, however, and "The Price
of Hegemony" offers a variation on Kagan's standard theme: the
imperative of militarized U.S. global primacy, whatever the price and
with little regard for who pays. [Few would charge Kagan with being a
deep or original thinker. As a writer, he is less philosophe than
pamphleteer, albeit one possessing a genuine gift for
packaging]{.underline}. Recall, for example, his famous assertion that
"Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus." Once deemed to
express a truth of Lippmannesque profundity, this warriors vs. wimps
formulation has since lost much of its persuasive appeal, not least
because the warriors, a.k.a. "the troops," have not fared especially
well when dispatched to liberate, pacify, or depose. So rather than
being enshrined alongside Walter Lippmann, Kagan will likely share the
fate of Scotty Reston or Joe Alsop, once prominent Washington-based
columnists who are now totally forgotten. Of course, much the same fate
awaits the entire gaggle of commentators (this writer included) who
pontificate on America's role in the world under the mistaken impression
that senior officials in the White House, Foggy Bottom, or the Pentagon
seek their counsel. Rarely do they do so. That said, [Kagan stands out
from the rest of the pack in one respect: His knack for combining
consistency with flexibility is matchless. He is nothing if not nimble.
Whatever may occur in the real world, he is ready with an explanation
for how events affirm the indispensability of assertive American
leadership.]{.underline} In Washington (and in the pages of Foreign
Affairs), this is always a welcome conclusion. [This nimbleness is
vividly on display in his most recent essay, its subtitle posing this
question: "Can America Learn to Use Its Power?" Kagan arrives at his own
answer---the United States not only can learn but must---even as he
ignores altogether what the vigorous expenditure of American power over
the past two decades has achieved, and at what cost. So his essay
contains various dark references to Russian misbehavior, along with a
handful to objectionable actions by China. Perhaps inevitably, Kagan
also throws in a few ominous allusions to Germany and Japan in the run
up to World War II, in Washington circles the go-to source of
authoritative historical instruction. As to post-9/11 U.S. wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, however, he is silent.]{.underline} They qualify
for not a single mention---none, zero, null, nada. [According to Kagan,
the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War occurred at least in part due to
American passivity. Successive post-Cold War U.S. administrations fell
down on the job. Put simply, they did not exert themselves to keep
Russia in check.]{.underline} While it would be "obscene to blame the
United States for Putin's inhumane attack on Ukraine," Kagan writes, to
"insist that the invasion was entirely unprovoked is misleading." The
United States had "played a strong hand poorly." In doing so, it gave
Vladimir Putin cause to think that he could get away with aggression.
Thus did Washington---as if sitting on its hands during the first two
decades of the present century---provoke Moscow. By "wielding U.S.
influence more consistently and effectively," presidents beginning with
the elder Bush could have prevented the devastation that Ukrainians have
suffered. From Kagan's point of view, the United States has been too
passive. Today, he writes, "the question is whether the United States
will continue to make its own mistakes"---mistakes of inaction, in his
view---"or whether Americans will learn, once again, that it is better
to contain aggressive autocracies early, before they have built up a
head of steam." [The reference to containing aggressive autocracies
early requires decoding. Kagan is dissimulating. What he is actually
proposing is further experiments with preventive war, which in the wake
of 9/11 became the centerpiece of U.S. national security policy. Kagan,
of course, supported the Bush Doctrine of preventive war. He was all in
on invading Iraq. Implemented in 2003 in the form of Operation Iraqi
Freedom, the Bush Doctrine produced disastrous results. Now, even two
decades later, Kagan cannot bring himself to acknowledge the grotesque
immensity of that mistake, nor its side effects, to include the rise of
Trumpism and all of its ancillary evils.]{.underline} "Can America Learn
to Use Its Power?" That this rates as an urgent question is certainly
the case. Yet to fancy that Robert Kagan possesses the qualifications to
offer an intelligible answer is a delusion. 

### Brooks and Mejier

#### Brooks and Mejier underestimate Europe.

Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,

Reply: To Repeat, Europe Can Defend Itself,\" Global Politics and
Strategy, 63(1), p. 41-49,
https://doi.org/10.1080/00396338.2021.1881252,  kav) 

Brooks and Meijer: alliance management and C4ISR 

[It is not news that military coalitions face management problems.
Stephen Brooks and Hugo Meijer believe that a European alliance unaided
by the US would face insurmountable difficulties, and Heisbourg seems to
agree. Military coalitions work for four main reasons: shared interest,
discussed above; a unified command structure; the experience and habits
of cooperation; and the sufficiency of a command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
(C4ISR) infrastructure for the type of war that the coalition plans to
fight. Although shortfalls and obstacles surely exist in these areas,
the European alliance would be well placed to address
them.]{.underline} 

Both the IISS team's scenario and my own posit that [the European
alliance would inherit NATO's existing command structure, though without
American officers or US military equipment]{.underline}.5 Brooks and
Meijer seem to assume that a US departure would produce the dissolution
of the entire extant command structure, and that the Europeans would
have to start from scratch. Why they assume this is unstated. In any
case, their fight, as they admit, is with the IISS team as much as it is
with me, as our analyses share this assumption, though the defensive
scenario I advance is likely less demanding on the C4ISR front than the
rapid counter-offensive that the IISS team deems essential. 

[Europeans have also been working together as allies for 70 years. The
habits of cooperation, knowledge of one another's strengths and
weaknesses, skills needed to surmount language barriers, and deeper
knowledge of one another's military commanders have been laboriously
developed. And there has been a sustained, if constantly challenging,
effort to produce common doctrine and standard
procedures]{.underline}.6 

In addition, Brooks and Meijer intimate that the Europeans lack the
autonomous C4ISR capability to run a war. The 'military satellite'
ledger they offer is somehow meant to convey the parlous state of Europe
relative to Russia. But [it tells us nothing especially useful, because
what we would like to know is what each side needs to address its
particular military problems. Overall, Russia has much more challenging
C4ISR problems than Europe, partly because its nuclear deterrent,
especially its land-based intercontinental-ballistic-missile force,
lives in the gunsights of the US military, which is postured to try to
eliminate them in the event of a nuclear war. The Russian military also
has to cover a vast landmass.]{.underline} In any case, the IISS's
Military Balance 2020, and Brooks and Meijer's own source, the Union of
Concerned Scientists, tell a more nuanced story than the summary table.
Europeans have invested in autonomous capability. According to the IISS,
the European states deploy nearly as many intelligence-gathering
satellites as Russia.7 Furthermore, [the authors include in the Russian
count the GLONASS navigation satellites but oddly exclude from the
European count the Galileo constellation of two dozen navigation
satellites in commission.8 Russia does have many more
military-communications satellites than Europe, but one suspects that
its very different strategic situation is the explanation.]{.underline} 

### Heisbourg

#### Heisbourg uses bad methods with inferior inputs, and he critiques the wrong part of Posen's idea.  

**Posen 21**, Ford International Professor of Political Science in the
Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
author of numerous articles and three books, 2-10-2021, (Barry, \"In
Reply: To Repeat, Europe Can Defend Itself,\" Global Politics and
Strategy, 63(1), p. 41-49,
https://doi.org/10.1080/00396338.2021.1881252,  kav) 

Heisbourg: relative inputs and nuclear deterrence 

[It is hard to know what to make of Heisbourg's ironically mistitled
contribution, 'Europe Can Afford the Cost of Autonomy'. After his
confirmatory review of the usual factors that make Europe particularly
inefficient, one wonders what resources Europe would need to muster to
defend itself. Europe already outmatches Russia in key military inputs,
including spending and personnel]{.underline}. Sceptics about Europe's
potential for military autonomy obscure or explain away these facts. In
addition to the standard arguments, Hei[sbourg embraces the newly
popular admonition that we must compare defence inputs on the basis of
purchasing power parity, not exchange rates, bringing European NATO's
favourable spending advantage down from roughly 4:1 to 1.7:1, or \$266
billion for Europe to \$160bn for Russia.]{.underline}9 [Even if we
accept this adjustment, a major gap favouring Europe remains. Europe
would need to be wildly inefficient to turn this into a net deficiency
so grave that it would, in the apparent view of the IISS team and Brooks
and Meijer, take 20 years of significantly increased military spending
to rectify. Heisbourg concludes that 'Europe's starting point is
arguably somewhat weaker' than I suggest, and on account of this he
shares the 'general pessimism' that I observe in the other commentators.
He may be as pessimistic as he wishes, but not on the basis of inferior
inputs.]{.underline} 

Insofar as my article is titled 'Europe Can Defend Itself', [Heisbourg
is free to introduce the subject of nuclear deterrence. At the same
time, I stated clearly that I would not discuss the issue even though it
does indeed require serious discussion. My only reference to nuclear
weapons was the comment that France and Britain are both nuclear-weapons
states, and that Russia would need to take this into account in a
decision to launch a war, and in its strategy for the conduct of
war.]{.underline} Does 'existential extended deterrence' exist in an
alliance that includes nuclear and non-nuclear states? What would it
deter? Would the members of such a coalition need to take any special
steps to make extended deterrence more credible? These are all questions
of judgement, which can be informed by theory and experience, but there
are no clear and comfortable answers. The extended-nuclear-deterrence
relationship between the US and Europe has itself always been a fraught
proposition. 

Looking beyond my original article, I venture two observations. Firstly,
Europeans would be unwise to attempt to revive the original US--NATO
strategy of substituting the threat of nuclear escalation for resilient
conventional forces. Under US pressure, the Alliance gradually abandoned
this strategy between 1960 and 1975, and built up its power of
conventional resistance. Once the Soviet Union developed the credible
ability to strike the US mainland under most conditions, nuclear first
use began to look less attractive to the United States. When the
guarantor is vulnerable, it is difficult to make believable the
commitment to fire first on another's behalf. 

Furthermore, as Heisbourg correctly argues, Europeans have to consider
how they can make extended deterrence credible. This has a diplomatic
component and a military one. Europeans should stress that nuclear
attacks by aggressor states deserve nuclear responses. If the United
Kingdom and France remain the sole nuclear-weapons states in the
European alliance, their nuclear diplomacy must regularly communicate
why such a response, however risky, could still be in their interests.
Observable military measures may also be necessary. Heisbourg offers
several creative ideas. The most obvious measures are those employed
today involving NATO's 'tactical nuclear weapons', which are owned by
the US but often slung under European aircraft. A turn of the US 'key'
turns the ally into a new nuclear power, and Russia can never know the
conditions under which this would occur, which adds considerable
uncertainty to any decision for war. France, the UK or both could
consider using similar 'dual key' arrangements with some of their
European partners.10 

 

 

### Ikenberry

#### Ikenberry and liberal primacists are wrong about global leadership and China -- the policy they promote is what drives China escalation in the first place 

**Shidore 21 --** is the Director of Studies at the Quincy Institute,
and is a senior non-resident fellow at the Council on Strategic Risks.
His areas of research and analysis are geopolitical risk, grand
strategy, and energy/climate security, with a special emphasis on Asia
and a senior research scholar at the University of Texas at Austin and

primacy",
<https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/08/04/calling-liberal-internationalism-what-it-is-american-primacy/>,
accessed 6/23/22)//jd 

Deudney and [Ikenberry greatly stress liberal primacy to achieve global
economic equity and avert environmental catastrophe. However, under
liberal primacy's long innings in Washington, these challenges have only
multiplied at home and abroad.]{.underline} The United States, under the
major influence of primacists of all shades, did not by itself create
all these problems. But its disproportionate power and wealth means that
it is more responsible than any other single actor. Moreover, [when
liberal and other primacists make extraordinary claims of global
leadership and explicitly seek to preserve unipolarity, they should also
accept a corresponding level of responsibility for all that has gone
wrong under their watch.]{.underline} Liberalism is also by no means
necessarily tied to U.S. primacy. The work of scholars such as Stephen
Wertheim (a co-founder of the Quincy Institute) and Michael Kazin has
cogently highlighted a very different American internationalism in the
pre-WW II era that opposed primacy in the long national tradition
(notwithstanding a few exceptions) of staying away from foreign wars and
advocating diplomacy to resolve disputes in extra-hemispheric conflicts.
[Nowhere do Deudney and Ikenberry seriously engage the core argument of
restrainers of armed dominance detracting from domestic priorities and
raising risks of regional and global conflict.]{.underline} Liberal
primacists have belatedly come around to reducing (though not
eliminating) the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East. But, as
Quincy Institute president Andrew Bacevich has laid out, few lessons
appear to have been learned from the Iraq war, which was not so much a
"blunder" as a flagrant violation of international law and American
values. Nearly two decades after that fateful step, primacists (liberal
and otherwise) show little desire for accountability from actors who
supported and executed this war ridden with illegal actions, a
reluctance that severely undermines their justifications for prosecuting
violations of other states. It is on China, however, that liberal
primacists flirt with the greatest danger to the international order[. A
rising China is framed as a threat, predominantly due to its
authoritarian system as also its recent actions in the region. Domestic
and foreign policies of most states are indeed linked, but they may
manifest in apparently inconsistent ways.]{.underline} For example,
powerful, authoritarian states may not necessarily seek global conquest
or even dominance (for example, China in the 15th century) just as major
democratic states may disavow global hegemony (the United States itself
from the late 19th century until World War II). Democratic powers may
also empower tyranny, as was seen with Israel's export of the
cyber-weapon Pegasus to several authoritarian governments recently[.
Liberal primacy has a deterministic, inflated view of Chinese power and
threat and little space for the major uncertainty in Chinese
capabilities and intentions two or three decades in the
future.]{.underline} Whereas Washington is stepping up on framing China
in stark cold war-type language, much of the world, including many U.S.
partners, has a much more nuanced viewpoint of the competition. The
reluctance of Southeast Asia or treaty ally South Korea to join the
U.S.-led Quad and the general lack of support across much of the world
for the monochromatic view of China's Belt and Road Initiative as an
exploitative debt trap are two examples. Prominent Southeast Asian
voices in particular are increasingly worried at the turn liberal
primacists' China strategy is taking. [Whittling away at the time-tested
One-China policy, over-militarization of relations with the Quad states,
and aggressive, publicly announced military FONOPs close to the Chinese
coast are only some of the ways in which liberal and other primacists
are helping raise risks of great power conflict]{.underline}. China is
not an existential threat to the United States. This is not to say that
China's excessive claims in the South China Sea, coercive pressure on
U.S. partners including Taiwan and India, exploitative deep-sea fishing,
cyber-attacks on the homeland, and certain trade practices should not be
of major concern. But it takes two hands to clap. When it comes to
China[, liberal primacy's reign in Washington feels as escalatory as the
Trump era.]{.underline} 

### IISS

#### Throw out any evidence by the IISS -International Institute for Strategic Studies, it makes too many baseless assumptions.   

**Posen 20**, Ford International Professor of Political Science in the
Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
author of numerous articles and three books, 12-2-2020, (Barry, \"Europe
Can Defend Itself,\" Global Politics and Strategy, 62(6), p. 7-34,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/00396338.2020.1851080>, tables abridged, kav)  

The IISS approach 

'Defending Europe' assesses NATO's military power absent the US. To test
NATO Europe's capability versus Russia, it selects a demanding scenario.
Lithuania and Poland get themselves into a war with Russia that starts
with little warning, and ends with Russia's conquest of Lithuania and
parts of northwest Poland. NATO Europe is compelled to reconquer this
lost territory. [The IISS analysts infer this requirement to liberate
from NATO's Article V commitment to its members and the assumption that
if NATO could not liberate these territories, other member states would
lose confidence in the Alliance, whereupon it would dissolve.
Presumably, the possession of such a counter-offensive capability is
taken to be essential to deter Russian attack.]{.underline} 

[The scenario is demanding for two reasons. Firstly, the Baltics are
inherently hard to defend.]{.underline} They became members of NATO and
the EU prior to the resurgence of geostrategic competition. Little
thought was given to the grave difficulty of successful defence against
an even moderately well-resourced Russian effort to retake them. These
states constitute a long, narrow finger of land, with the northernmost
states bordering Russia and access to Lithuania constricted to a narrow
land corridor -- the Suwalki Gap -- between Kaliningrad, a heavily armed
Russian exclave, and Belarus, which is often regarded as a Russian
satellite. [Secondly, the Baltic states have small populations relative
to Russia, and could put up only limited resistance on their
own.]{.underline} 

Although the Estonian border provides some natural defences in the form
of lakes, ponds and swamps, [the Baltic states simply cannot hope to
defend themselves successfully. And unlike Finland, which has the
strategic depth to support a strategy of delay and extended attrition,
Baltic military forces have no space to which they could withdraw so as
to regroup and continue the fight]{.underline}. Because of the
geography, NATO would have to station very large forces in the Baltics
along a 700--800-kilometre border to have a hope of defending them.17
But given the area's geography and topography, even large NATO forces
would be highly vulnerable to catastrophic failure because a single
Russian success could cut them off from assistance. The maritime
approaches to the Baltic states do not solve the problem because Russian
[bases are so close to them.]{.underline} Forces in Russia proper and in
Kaliningrad could exploit the full panoply of the country's
coastal-defence weapons, including modern naval mines, anti-ship
missiles and land-based air-defence missiles, to make naval operations
along the coast quite costly.18 Th[e authors of the IISS study seem to
accept that the Baltics are indefensible, but then assess NATO Europe's
capabilities against a mission almost as hard as defending them:
retaking the lost territory]{.underline}.19 Furthermore, [Russia is
credited with completing its conquest and occupation of Lithuania,
settling militarily into conquered terrain in Poland and building out a
powerful military occupation of Belarus. NATO is then tested against the
requirement to counter-attack these positions 90 days later. In this
case, it is reasonable to attribute, as the authors do, a significant
advantage to the defender, in this case Russia.]{.underline} 

[Russia is also assumed to have a significant advantage in military
forces available for this contingency]{.underline}. Half of all the
ground forces of the Russian army are committed to the theatre, which
comes to 75 'battalion tactical groups' (BTGs).20 [Russia withholds a
third of these units for a variety of security missions]{.underline},
and, at the time the scenario unfolds, 51 BTGs are in Belarus,
Kaliningrad and Lithuania. These forces, equivalent to 18 NATO brigades,
are assumed to be well armed, well trained and in a high state of
readiness (see Table 2).21 [The scenario invokes a series of special
measures that Russia undertakes, including drawing personnel from across
Russia to fully man combat units and airlifting an entire airborne
division]{.underline} into Kaliningrad.22 [These activities are either
unnoticed or ignored by NATO,]{.underline} which does not increase the
readiness of its own forces. Russia does have the initiative in this
scenario, and has worked for several years to improve the readiness of
its forces. And the Russian army has done well recently in small,
carefully controlled fights against markedly inferior forces in Donbas
and Syria, as well as in the slow-motion, largely unopposed seizure of
Crimea. But it has not geared up for even a minor operation against
serious resistance since its unimpressive performance in Georgia in
2008. In this light, the IISS's assumptions seem very favourable to
Russian forces. 

Overall, [NATO's available forces are assumed to be limited. The study
does make one assumption that some would consider advantageous to NATO
Europe, however. Although the US has exited the Alliance in this
scenario, the NATO command structure -- staffs, communications hardware
and plans -- has passed intact to the Alliance (less the US complement)
and is available to coordinate the operation.]{.underline} The authors
rightly observe that without this assumption, the Europeans would have a
difficult time managing a large operation, as the 'shadow' structures
maintained by the EU probably are not sufficiently developed to run a
large operation. With regard to available European forces, however, the
IISS study is very pessimistic. While it attributes to NATO's European
members nearly 100 armoured and mechanised brigades, it asserts that
about 75% of them could not contribute to the operation because they are
equipped with 'obsolescent tank, infantry-fighting-vehicle, or
armoured-personnel-carrier designs'.23 Of the 22 remaining adequately
equipped mechanised brigades, the IISS observes that under normal
conditions, European units are not particularly 'ready', and therefore
assumes that only 50%, or 11 brigades, could deploy to Poland and be
ready to fight within 90 days.24 

Thus, [the study casts Russia as working hard, creatively and
effectively to ready its forces for combat in short order, and Europe as
far less determined.25 One-third of all Russian ground combat units,
indeed the best third, are assumed to be on the front line, whereas
perhaps 10% of European units are judged available for the campaign. No
wonder things look bleak.]{.underline} 

[Simulating combat is not a simple matter.]{.underline} The IISS adopted
some rules of thumb to assess the adequacy of NATO Europe's forces to
the task of liberating Lithuanian and Polish territories conquered by
Russia. 'Defending Europe' posits that offensive success becomes
plausible when the attacker enjoys a material superiority in the theatre
of 1.5:1, and more certain at 2:1.26 The authors apply this ratio to
major ground-force elements and to tactical air forces. No source is
provided for the origin of these rules of thumb, but one can find such
ratios cited frequently in Cold War-era assessments for ground forces.27
The 1.5:1 theatre-wide force ratio emerged from many different analyses
of the same problem: what it would take to break through on a front that
was thickly defended, a problem that first emerged during the First
World War on the Western Front. [A possible criticism of the use of that
ratio in this hypothetical theatre is that neither Russia nor NATO has
sufficient brigades to thickly defend the entire front.]{.underline}
Thus, it is quite possible that the scope for manoeuvre is greater than
assumed, in which case the requirements for offence and defence might be
better assessed through a series of war games.28 

The IISS analysts calculate the forces required for NATO Europe by
multiplying the Russian force by 1.5 and 2. They then subtract their
estimate of available European forces to come up with NATO Europe's
force deficit. To meet the 1.5:1 criterion, Europe would need 27
mechanised brigades, and for the 2:1 criterion 36 brigades.29 Given that
Europe only has 11 ready mechanised brigades, the shortfall is between
17 and 26 brigades. (Strikingly, the entire active US Army could now
provide only another 10--14 armoured or mechanised brigades.30 So the
IISS analysis implicitly holds that NATO's ground forces would be
inadequate even with active US participation.) Based on their
pessimistic view of the general level of readiness (50%) achievable in
European military units, the authors have to double the brigade
shortfalls to generate their hypothetical overall shortfall and the
budget necessary to remedy it. Europe needs to either stand up, or
thoroughly re-equip, between 34 and 52 brigades, at an initial capital
cost of \$150--200bn.31 Finally, the analysis rightly calls attention to
often overlooked combat-support assets that European countries
effectively liquidated from their armies after the Cold War. The most
notable of these are short-, medium- and long-range surface-to-air
missile batteries to defend against combat aircraft, drones, cruise
missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.32 European ground forces have
none of these assets, and would certainly require some to mount a
counter-offensive. 

 

#### Ext: IISS doesn't make any sense; they assume bandwagoning -- an unlikely and empirically disproven theory.

The IISS team: bandwagoning versus balancing 

[The IISS team says that, should the European alliance lose control of
one or more states in the east and not be able promptly to restore the
situation, the alliance would collapse. Thus, a massive infusion of
offensive armoured striking power into the present order of battle is
required -- at least 32 additional armoured brigades, or roughly the
equivalent to the late Cold War German Army but fully modernised.3 The
picture the IISS analysts paint is both dark and strange.]{.underline}
If one or more Baltic states were to fall to Russian aggression, other
Eastern European countries whose citizens know what it is like to live
under the Russian boot, and who clamoured for NATO and European Union
membership, would quickly abandon their sole protector. [The larger
European states such as Germany, which in particular benefits greatly
from not having Russian troops on its immediate border, would instead
stand down, allowing Russia to dominate Eastern Europe again. Other
European states further afield would simply shrug, ignoring the stark
evidence of Russia's aggressive intent.]{.underline} 

[Students of international politics have a term for this feared cascade
of falling political dominoes: bandwagoning with the aggressor. The
phenomenon is not unknown, but it is uncommon. If bandwagoning were the
rule, Europeans would all speak French or German or Russian, as at least
one of these aspiring European hegemons would have succeeded in its
day]{.underline}. Far more common is balancing against the aggressor --
that is, joining with other threatened states to build a coalition of
resistance against aspiring hegemons.4 States value their sovereignty
and those that can will often fight for it. Even small and isolated
states often balance if they think there is a chance of success.
[Europeans today do prefer passing the buck to the US to get their
protection on the cheap. But absent that option, balancing is
likely.]{.underline} The existence of an up-and-running European
military coalition makes balancing a reasonable option. One cannot rule
out the possible political collapse on which the IISS team built its
military scenario and force requirements. But, [if this is their
considered and expert assessment of the actual commitment of Europeans
to defend their independence and liberties, US supporters of the
transatlantic relationship should sombrely take note.]{.underline} In
the eyes of the IISS team, the European allies are, per Thomas Paine,
summer soldiers and sunshine patriots. 

### Beckley

#### Michael Beckley provides an inaccurate picture of US-China relations

**Shifrinson 13** \[Winter 2012/13, Shifrinson, Joshua R. Itzkowitz,
Joshua R. Itzkowitz Shifrinson's teaching and research interests focus
on the intersection of international security and diplomatic history,
particularly the rise and fall of great powers and the origins of grand
strategy. He has special expertise in great power politics since 1945
and U.S. engagement in Europe and Asia., "Debating China\'s Rise and
U.S. Decline", The MIT Press,
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/41804177?seq=3>\]//AA

[Michael **Beckley's**]{.underline} article deserves attention for
challenging the view that the United States is declining because China
is rising.\' Its **[ambiguous definition of decline, how- ever, sends
the wrong impression about the distribution of economic and military
power between the United States and China.]{.underline}** Without being
explicit, Beckley implies that the United States is not declining
because the absolute difference of economic, mili- tary, and
technological capabilities between the United States and China is
growing. In contrast, both theory and history suggest that it is more
important that the relative dis- tribution of economic and military
capabilities between the United States and China is falling: as I
propose below, decline is best defined as a decrease in the ratio of
economic and military capabilities between two great powers. As a
result, even if the United States maintains a large advantage in
absolute capabilities, the fact that U.S. capabilities are decreasing
relative to China's means that (1) China will find it easier to advance
its interests where U.S. and Chinese goals diverge, while (2) the United
States' ability to pursue its own interests in world affairs will be
increasingly constrained by Chinese power. The remainder of this letter
proceeds in four sections. First, [I challenge Beckley's definition of
decline]{.underline} and emphasize the need to analyze the relative
distribution of ca- pabilities when assessing the decline phenomenon.
Using historical examples, I next demonstrate that the relative
distribution of power better captures the ability of states to compete
with one another. Subsequently, I show that the United States is
declining relative to China across several measures of economic and
military power. Finally, I propose that [the United States' relative
decline suggests a different response to China's rise, namely, U.S.
retrenchment.]{.underline} DEFINING DECLINE AND MEASURING POWER In his
article, **[Beckley does not define what he means by
"decline."]{.underline}** He implies, how- ever, that decline occurs
when the absolute difference in capabilities between two states falls
(pp. 44-55). For example, Beckley states that it is "significant that
the average Chi- nese citizen is more than \$17,000 poorer relative to
the average American than he was in 1991" (p. 59). Particularly
important for [Beckley]{.underline} is the difference in per capita
gross domestic product (GDP) and measures of technological
sophistication: larger absolute differences between the United States
and China in these indicators mean an economi- cally and militarily
stronger United States (pp. 58---59, 63---65). This
[definition]{.underline}, however, [sets an artificially high bar by
which to assess decline, one that mischaracterizes the debate over
American decline and makes limited theoretical sense.]{.underline}
Instead, decline is better defined in terms of the relative distribution
of economic and military capabili- ties between two great powers:
decline occurs when one state's economic and military capabilities
increase at a faster rate than the other's, such that the ratio of
capabilities between the two falls. As such, it is more important for
assessing the current distribu- tion of power that the ratio of American
per capita GDP to Chinese per capita GDP fell from 67:1 in 1991 to 9:1
in 2011, than it is that the difference in per capita GDP rose from
\$37,300 in 1991 to \$41,600 in 2011 (in constant 2010 dollars).° Few
participants in the decline debate argue that China is likely to
overtake the United States across all measures of economic and military
power.3 More representative of mainstream views in the debate is the
National Intelligence Council's Global 2025 re- port, which argues,
"Although the United States is likely to remain the single most powerful
actor, the United States' relative strength \[\...\] will decline and US
leverage will become more constrained. 4 In other words, the policy
discussion centers on whether China's growth is making it relatively
harder for the United States to pursue its interests without other
states opposing its actions---not whether the United States is losing
out to China in absolute terms. Furthermore, for purposes of
international relations theory, [scholars usually distin- guish between
decline as an absolute loss of power and decline as a relative loss of
ca- pabilities.]{.underline}5 Many also assume that there is a threshold
above which a state is a great power, defined as an actor with
sufficient aggregate economic, military, technological, and geographic
resources to influence others' behavior on an international scale. De-
cline occurs when a state above this threshold increases its
capabilities at a faster rate than another state, such that the ratio of
capabilities between the two shrinks. This change matters in two ways.
First, the relative loss of capabilities between states A and B requires
A to struggle to maintain its international position by improving
economic performance or building military forces. Second, B's improved
capabilities make it more difficult for state A to challenge state B's
interests than had previously been the case-A is constrained by B's
growing power---while B can more readily compete with A if their
interests conflict.

//KS)

Rather unbelievably (or believably, depending on where you sit)
[Mearsheimer has written an endorsement of Atzmon\'s new
book]{.underline}, \"The Wandering Who?\" Here is what Mearsheimer says
about Atzmon: Gilad Atzmon has [written a fascinating and provocative
book on Jewish identity in the modern world.]{.underline} He shows how
assimilation and liberalism are making it incredibly difficult for Jews
in the Diaspora to maintain a powerful sense of their \'Jewishness.\'
Panicked Jewish leaders, [he argues, have turned to]{.underline} Zionism
([blind loyalty to Israel]{.underline}) and scaremongering (the threat
of another Holocaust) to keep the tribe united and distinct from the
surrounding goyim. As Atzmon\'s own case demonstrates, this strategy is
not working and is causing many Jews great anguish. The Wandering Who?
Should be widely read by Jews and non-Jews alike.\' [In this new book,
Atzmon suggests, among other things, that scholars should reopen the
question of medieval blood libels leveled against Jews-]{.underline}-
accusations that Jews used the blood of Christian children to make
matzo, and which [provoked countless massacres of Jews in many different
countries.]{.underline} If you recall from the fight over \"The Israel
Lobby,\" which Mearsheimer wrote with Stephen Walt, of Harvard, the
authors claimed that they were simply writing a critique of American
foreign policy, and of certain American citizens who, they said,
\"distorted\" foreign policy. Many of us disagreed. Here is a bit of
what David Rothkopf wrote about [**Mearsheimer** a]{.underline}nd Walt:
\"W)hatever the pale intellectual merits of his hackneyed argument may
be (the authors) know full well that their prominence on this issue has
come not because they have had a single new insight but rather because
they were willing and one can only [believe inclined to play to a crowd
whose \'views\' were **fueled by prejudice** and worse.]{.underline}
They may not be anti-Semites themselves but [they made a cynical
decision to cash in on anti-Semitism]{.underline} by offering to dress
up old hatreds in the dowdy Brooks Brothers suits of the Kennedy School
and the University of Chicago.\" Now, [Mearsheimer is endorsing the
writing of a man who espouses neo-Nazi views]{.underline}. In other
words, he\'s not even bothering to make believe anymore \-- [he\'s moved
**from a self-described critic of Israel to a corrosive critic of Jewry
itself**.]{.underline} The blogger Adam Holland, like yours truly,
didn\'t quite believe that Mearsheimer would endorse such a crude
anti-Semite, so he asked him to confirm: I had trouble believing that [a
distinguished professor at one of the world\'s greatest universities
would link himself to a hatemonger like Atzmon]{.underline}. So I sent
Professor Mearsheimer an email quoting the blurb and asking him to
verify it\'s accuracy. I also gave him an opportunity to amend it or add
to it. Here\'s what he wrote back: \"The blurb below is the one I wrote
for \"The Wandering Who\" and I have no reason to amend it or embellish
it, as it accurately reflects my view of the book.\" Gliad
[Atzmon]{.underline}, by the way, is also [on record saying
this]{.underline}: [\"I believe that from certain ideological
perspective, **Israel is actually far worse than Nazi
Germany**.\"]{.underline} Perhaps Mearsheimer has found a new co-author.

### Brands and Feaver

#### Brands is wrong and ignores historical examples that support offshore balancing -- offshore balancing is the best way to ensure US interests

MEARSHEIMER is R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of
Political Science at the University of Chicago. STEPHEN M. WALT is

MEARSHEIMER AND WALT REPLY In "The Case for Offshore Balancing," we
argue that if a potential hegemon emerges in Europe, Northeast Asia, or
the Persian Gulf, Washington should commit resources to preserve a
favorable balance of power and, if necessary, fight to defend it. [If no
potential hegemon is present, however, the United States should remain
offshore and let regional powers uphold the balance. Hal Brands and
Peter Feaver reject this recommendation and contend that the United
States should continue its **failed pursuit** of its existing grand
strategy, liberal hegemony. But they repeatedly **misrepresent** our
argument and offer a **dubious account** of the relevant
history---unwittingly underscoring the superiority of offshore
balancing.]{.underline} Brands and Feaver begin by claiming that we want
the United States to remain offshore in Europe, Asia, and the Gulf,
intervening in those regions only after war has broken out and a hegemon
is about to win. [This assertion allows them to accuse us of wanting to
roll back current U.S. alliances in all three areas and to suggest that
had U.S. policymakers adopted our approach in the late 1940s, there
would have been no NATO, no strategy of containment, and no Cold War
victory. This predictable attempt to make us sound like isolationists is
wrong. In our article, we make it clear that the United States should
deploy forces onshore before war breaks out if the regional powers
cannot check a rising hegemon, and we describe the United States' Cold
War alliances as a clear-cut example of this policy.]{.underline}
Moreover, we recommend the continued deployment of U.S. forces in Asia
to counter any future Chinese attempt to dominate that region. [Contrary
to what Brands and Feaver say, Washington's alliances and force postures
during the Cold War and in Asia today are **wholly consistent** with
offshore balancing.]{.underline} In effect, [**Brands** and Feaver
**portray U.S. policy** in much of the first half of the twentieth
century as textbook offshore balancing but claim that Cold War
containment represented the "reverse" of that policy.]{.underline}
[**Not so**: the United States followed the core logic of offshore
balancing from 1900 to 1990 and embraced liberal hegemony only after the
Soviet Union collapsed. Under offshore balancing, the United States
exploits its **favorable location** and **calibrates** its overseas
commitments according to what is happening in key regions. Under liberal
hegemony]{.underline}, by contrast, those factors hardly matter. [The
United States is supposed to deploy forces around the globe under any
and all circumstances, whether it faces a single peer competitor, a
complex multipolar world of contending great powers, or no serious
enemies at all.]{.underline} No matter what the world looks like, the
recommendation is always the same: the United States should try to run
it. [But as the past 25 years have shown again and again, this approach
leads to **costly quagmires** and repeated foreign policy
failures.]{.underline} Indeed, it is telling that [**Brands** and Feaver
**never say what U.S. interests are** or attempt to specify priorities
among them. Instead, they justify the deployment of U.S. forces almost
everywhere by assuming that doing so guarantees peace. Again, **Brands
and Feaver are mistaken**.]{.underline} [They suggest that the United
States could have prevented World War II had it committed troops to
Europe before the conflict started.]{.underline} [But Europe was a
simmering cauldron of great-power rivalry in the interwar
period]{.underline}, and in all likelihood, even an enormous [**U.S.**
military presence there would not have calmed the
continent]{.underline}. It's hard to believe that U.S. troops would have
proved sufficient to deter Hitler or put an end to the suspicions
between Berlin and Moscow. Moreover, [committing a large army to Europe
would have ensured that the United States was involved in the
**bloodbath** of World War II from the beginning. From an American
perspective, it was better to enter that conflict as late as possible
and let others bear the brunt of the fighting. Events since 1945 provide
abundant evidence that a large U.S. military presence does not always
ensure peace.]{.underline} Such a [presence in East Asia failed to keep
the United States out of two bloody wars there during the Cold War
(Korea and Vietnam), and despite the tens of thousands of troops in the
region today]{.underline}, few would deny that there is a serious
possibility of military clashes between China and the United States over
the East China and South China Seas, Taiwan, or the Korean Peninsula.
[Nor did a major U.S. military presence in Europe prevent the Balkan
wars in the 1990s or the current war in Ukraine, which could escalate
into a broader conflict involving the United States. And in the Middle
East, repeated U.S. military engagement since the end of the Cold War
has not kept the region from becoming engulfed in wars---and in fact
caused many of those wars.]{.underline} This is no accident, because
[pursuing liberal hegemony, as Brands and Feaver advocate, not only
fails to guarantee peace around the world; it also leads to **foolish
wars**.]{.underline} The belief that the United States should be
committed all over the world produced the Vietnam War, a clear departure
from offshore balancing. [That same thinking lay behind the disastrous
2003 invasion of Iraq---which Feaver supported and we opposed---as well
as the failed U.S. interventions in Afghanistan and Libya. The United
States has also interfered in Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, among
other places, with little to show for it. **Brands and Feaver
trivialize** these **costly failures** as "a few undeniable
setbacks,"]{.underline} but they were in fact an inevitable consequence
of the misguided attempt to garrison the world and spread democracy by
force. [Brands and Feaver also reject offshore balancing by saying that
"although the right moment for intervening can sometimes be seen in
hindsight, identifying it in real time, amid enormous uncertainty, is
far harder." But deciding whether and when to intervene is much easier
under our strategy, since offshore balancers, unlike liberal hegemonists
such as Brands and Feaver, provide clear criteria to inform that
decision.]{.underline} But if the United States has vital interests
everywhere and U.S. intervention guarantees peace, as they maintain,
then it should have intervened to prevent every Arab-Israeli war, all
three Indo-Pakistani wars, the Iran-Iraq War, the First and Second Congo
Wars, and so on[.]{.underline} By their logic, Washington should keep
expanding its overseas military presence until the entire world is at
peace. [Lastly, Brands and Feaver write that offshore balancing makes
the United States "more dependent on morally bankrupt regimes,"
insisting further that "Americans expect their allies to abide by
minimum humanitarian standards." **History shows
otherwise**.]{.underline} The United States allied with Joseph Stalin in
World War II and tacitly with Mao Zedong in the 1970s---both of whom
murdered millions of their own citizens. [Washington has also propped up
numerous Latin American dictators, today backs a military regime in
Egypt and a harsh theocracy in Saudi Arabia, and continues to turn a
blind eye to, if not support, Israel's brutal treatment of the
Palestinians.]{.underline} International politics is a dangerous
business, and moral tradeoffs are sometimes necessary. [By committing
U.S. power more selectively, however, offshore balancing requires such
compromises only when the United States faces imminent threats to its
vital interests. By encouraging the U.S. military to get involved
everywhere, Brands and Feaver's approach often forces Washington to rely
on dubious allies in far-flung regions]{.underline}. Once committed to
defending them, of course, it has little leverage over their behavior.
[Given liberal hegemony's many flaws, it is no wonder U.S. foreign
policy has failed so often in recent years. One does wonder, however,
**why Brands and Feaver continue to defend it.**]{.underline}

**The U.S.'s declining heg allows other nations to model more prosporous
democracies which revitalizes the global economy and checks
environmental harm**

\'**[The declining global hegemony of the United States will be an
opportunity to build better lives everywhere]{.underline}**\' Recently,
some of the "talking heads" on the news have been worrying about the
demise of US global hegemony. We are told that the "American empire" is
in decline and our influence and status around the world are falling. We
are told that this bodes poorly for both the people of the United States
and the rest of the world. That is not how I see it. While I tend to
agree that the United States is losing its hegemony, I believe that
**[all of us]{.underline}** (in the USA and elsewhere) [**will be better
off if the United States is no longer the "leader" of the world.** Our
decline has been going on since the time of Richard Nixon]{.underline},
through Carter, the Bushes, Clinton, Obama, and has accelerated under
Trump. [The President's favoritism for the white and the rich, his
erratic destruction of the administrative and diplomatic state, his
complete inability to address COVID-19, his rejection of reason, science
and expertise, his cultural ignorance, his meanness and cruelty, his
selfish disregard for others (nations and peoples) all have underscored
and advanced our national decline. We have been taught to think that our
country's position in the world stems in part from our status as the
world's one true democracy, but it is now very clear that is not the
case.]{.underline} Especially since Citizens United, **[political power
in this country has prioritized wealth and those who have
it.]{.underline}** The United States is now a county "of the rich, by
the rich, and for the rich." We have tax laws that favor capital over
income; we have civil and criminal justice systems that protect property
more than people; our public institutions routinely criminalize
immigrants, the poor, and people of color. [If the new global "role
models" are places like Denmark, Norway, or Costa Rica, surely the world
would be headed towards fewer threats to peace, less military spending,
fewer attacks on local democracies, more concern for human rights, less
environmental destruction, more environmental protection, and more
democracy.]{.underline} Our national elections are not decided by the
popular vote, but instead by an archaic process based an
unrepresentative group called the "electoral college." Our laws and
policies reflect the interest of the wealthy as communicated to wealthy
legislators by the lobbyists of big business. We have voting laws that
make it a burden to vote for many. As a result, too often public policy
does not reflect the opinions or interests of the majority. If it did,
we would be like other developed countries and adopt national health
care, paid parental leave, stronger controls on guns and weapons, free
higher education, reproductive rights, and a higher minimum wage. If we
are honest with ourselves, we must admit that **[there are many more
democratic nations in the world today. Their influence inevitably rises
as ours falls and this is a good thing for everyone.]{.underline}** Much
of the U. S. hegemony has stemmed from the fact that [the United States
is surely the most heavily armed and most militarily active country in
the world.]{.underline} The national myth is that we use military force
reluctantly and only when it is necessary to insure human rights, peace,
and security. But let's look at the record: Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Cuba, Grenada, Dominican Republic, Chile, Central America,
Libya, Congo, Iran, Iraq, Panama, Afghanistan. Are any of these places
were made better as a consequences of our covert and overt actions? We
spend more on weapons of war than any other country in the world.
Researchers at Brown University have found that since the horror of
9/11, the so-called "war on terrorism" has killed 800,000, displaced
37,000,000, and cost taxpayers \$6.4 trillion. [We are told that the
United States is the greatest, most productive and fairest economy in
the world. It isn't.]{.underline} Over the last several years, **[our
share of world production has declined significantly. Increasingly our
economy is characterized by wide inequalities, environmental
destruction, and decreasing life chances for the many.]{.underline}**
The earnings ratio between CEOs and their employees has widened
dramatically. Bosses now earn as much as 400 times the incomes of their
employees. Ordinary Americans no longer believe that future generations
will have more comfortable lives than current ones. People of color in
the United States face significant economic damage just because of their
heritage and ethnicity. President Trump did not create this situation,
but he is making it worse. His administration's mishandling of COVID has
driven down the lives of ordinary Americans. Unemployment is up; incomes
are down; mass evictions are looming; GDP has collapsed; and all this is
doubly true for persons of color. The only folks doing well are a few
tech bosses and those who live off the stock market. In addition, **[the
American economy is not sustainable environmentally.]{.underline}**
Since we no longer can claim any kind of real commitment to
environmental protection, [we can not even pretend to be an
international leader in this area. Out tax system is notoriously unfair
and confusing. It favors the wealthy over the middle and working
classes]{.underline}; it favors growth over maintenance and endurance;
it favors corporations over families. We rescue banks from their unwise
and sometimes criminal investments while allowing health care expenses
to bankrupt ordinary people, who already live without paid medical or
parental leave, decent vacations, or old age pensions (all commonplaces
in developed and developing nations around the world). [Americans live
shorter and less healthy lives than people do in most developed
nations.]{.underline} Our schools are nowhere near the best in the
world, and many schools in poor and working class areas are so
underfunded and under-resourced that they look more like tenements than
campuses. They test and segregate more than they build and educate.
Classes are large, standardized testing proliferates, teachers are
underpaid, armed cops patrol the halls, and facilities are crumbling.
Simply put, **[we have nothing to teach the rest of the world about how
to build an economy that serves the people.]{.underline}** Many nations
already know how to do it and hopefully, as we decline, they will become
ready international examples of "best practices." We have long believed
we are the proverbial "city on the hill," a place that is home to a life
so rewarding that it is a model for all. That emperor, too, has no
clothes. A supposed "nation of immigrants," we do not welcome newcomers.
Instead, we attempt to deter migrants through practices of harassment,
detention, and family separation. The Coronavirus and the continuing
trauma of police brutality have revealed that [our society and its
communities are unhealthy.]{.underline} Too often, residents have no
trust in their government and see the police and other agencies as the
agents of an occupying power. And people around the world recognize that
we are a violent nation. [Gun violence rages and mass
shootings]{.underline} in schools, churches, nightclubs, and movie
theaters [have become distressingly common.]{.underline} Deadly police
repression and practices of mass incarceration impact our communities,
particularly neighborhoods of color. Guns and violence even characterize
our entertainment media, which we export around the globe. "Hollywood"
gets rich by displaying false and elaborately decorated images of fear,
violence and anger. [What does such an unreflectively violent place have
to teach the rest of the world? The cultural spread of a violent breed
of radical individualism and the acceptance of deep inequalities are
destroying the foundations of our society.]{.underline} ¨Looking out for
number one" cannot form the basis of a livable, functioning community.
Norms of reciprocity and equity suffer when people must struggle against
each other to fulfill even the most basic needs such as food, clothing,
housing and medical care. While many countries define the collective
provision of basic needs as the necessary social infrastructure of a
good society, we worry about something called the "nanny state." The few
such programs we do have are inefficient and inadequate by design, rife
with unnecessary administrative costs, bureaucratic means testing, and
minimal resources. In many, if not most, developed nations ordinary
people earn better wages, have better schools, live healthier lives, and
are more secure and comfortable in communities where they feel
respected, valued, and cared for. So, it is very likely that [the
declining global hegemony of the United States will be an opportunity to
build better lives everywhere.]{.underline} If the new global "role
models" are places like Denmark, Norway, or Costa Rica, surely the world
would be headed towards fewer threats to peace, less military spending,
fewer attacks on local democracies, more concern for human rights, less
environmental destruction, more environmental protection, and more
democracy. And, [if America uses this opportunity to change what we
spend on and how we care for each other, life will be better here at
home too.]{.underline}

### Threat Inflation

#### American hegemony leads to threat inflation

It seems to run in the American DNA. For as long as I've been involved
in U.S. foreign policy --- as a CIA operations officer and a long-term
CIA forecaster, and later at a prominent think tank --- I perceive
remarkably little change in that one deep-seated, almost unconscious
presumption of basic American innocence, that the U.S. mission in the
world is fundamentally benign. It pervades all our public utterances. It
is dangerous. I have no wish to launch into a litany of American sins,
failures, or mistakes by omission, or more often commission, that have
by almost any measure been disastrous for so many foreign countries
"visited" by U.S. military operations. The list is long and well known
--- Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, indirectly in
Yemen in most recent times. Acts of omission include neglect of the
half-century running sore of Israel's occupation of Palestine and
friendship with unsavory dictators because they "serve the U.S. national
interest," while publicly stressing America's (cherry-picked) commitment
to democracy overseas. China oppresses Uighurs, bad. India oppresses
Muslims in Kashmir, no comment. Hypocrisy abounds. But I'm writing about
something even simpler. I am baffled by the kind of American mindset
that, seemingly without guile, simultaneously maintains two quite
incompatible views of the U.S. role in the world. Premise One: With the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Washington boastfully proclaimed
itself the "world's sole superpower." The United States at once gained
the ability --- even the right --- to exercise unrestricted
intervention, and with military force, anywhere in the world. No region
is ever deemed too insignificant, too distant, too small not to fall at
some point within the framework of a "major U.S. national security
interest." Unsurprisingly, it is probably this self-arrogated license,
this global sheriff's badge, that marks the beginning of the disastrous
decline of U.S. foreign policy ever since. But it's the second
accompanying belief or premise that is the stunner: [The United States,
so goes the self-narrative, has simply been working steadfastly to
maintain global stability and a global "order" --- an order that is
supposed to represent a global good for all. While engaged in this
selfless task, crocodiles have been nipping at our legs wherever we go.
Consequently, as we engage in this self-appointed task, we find
ourselves constantly being "challenged," or "threatened" by other states
or groups that do not seem to recognize or acquiesce in the universal
goodness of Pax Americana.]{.underline} So, think about it: how can the
United States exercise supreme and unchallengeable power around the
world on the one hand, and yet simultaneously not provoke negative
reactions from others? You can't be the most powerful player on the
block --- or what the U.S. military often tellingly calls its global
footprint" --- and yet not expect strong reactions from those affected
by it. Again, I'm not even trying to assess how good or bad, how
generous or harsh, how wise or foolish U.S. actions have been. [It's
simply the perception in our eyes that we are nearly always the
aggrieved party facing negative or ungrateful reactions.]{.underline}
So, we read again and again about the endless array of challenges we
face: [our media talks non-stop about how Washington must meet the
"Russian challenge," "the Iranian threat," "the Chinese threat," "the
Islamic extremist challenge," etc.]{.underline} But how often do we ask
the question, why do they present a threat? Some political scientists
might simply suggest that any two major powers are destined to clash.
Yet any such clash still represents a choice by their national
leaderships. Why were Britain and France sworn enemies for centuries
until one day they weren't? Why were France and Germany seen as "natural
enemies" for over a century and then suddenly decide after World War II
they didn't have to be? Some might respond that the game changed because
new "enemies" cropped up to replace old ones. Maybe so. But we must
acknowledge that we are always making conscious choices and decisions
about who we select as the enemy du jour based on our assessment of what
serves our "national interest," a phrase routinely invoked by foreign
policy specialists and politicians. But "national interest" tends to be
a highly subjective affair that is eminently debatable. In fact,
determining just what are our true national interests is what foreign
policy debate is all about. And the answer depends on your worldview,
your ideology. One problem with being the "world's sole superpower" is
that any challenge to one's hegemony from any quarter identifies the
challenger as an enemy, or potential enemy[. Hegemony finds any
challenge insufferable.]{.underline} It has been an integral part of
Washington's worldview for many decades now. [Any government that
resists U.S. hegemony should ideally be intimidated, overthrown or
eliminated. Cuba, Nicaragua, Iran, Syria, Egypt in the day, China,
Russia, Venezuela --- it's hard to get off that enemy list when you
actively assert your independence from Washington.]{.underline} For
these reasons, then, I find myself deeply disturbed when, within
President Biden's brand-new foreign policy team, we find officials still
darkly invoking the "threats" posed by other countries. Mere invocation
of the word "threat" is all it takes. The charge eventually becomes
axiomatic. China? Sure, obvious threat, no need to think about it.
Everybody knows Russia is a black hat. Everybody knows that Iran is a
"malign" actor. But we seem unwilling to consider for a moment just how
we arrived at these assessments, however accurate or inaccurate. A[s the
world's greatest military power, should we even wonder whether U.S.
policies towards Russia since the Soviet collapse had anything to do
with Moscow's policies and views of the United States? This question
seems out of bounds in the mainstream media]{.underline}. And, in our
tensions with China, is it worth considering what a timeline of
relations might show about a possible two-way street of provocation? Is
Iran inherently anti-American, a stereotype that has been perpetuated
over decades? Was there no earlier formative background worth
considering? This is why our diplomats, armchair strategists and pundits
should at least be reading the "enemy press" for a more nuanced view of
how we appear to others. (Or do we instinctively know it's all
propaganda or "fake news?") Might not our nation be served by
periodically reprinting editorials from the Russian, Chinese, or Iranian
media --- just out of curiosity as to how they see things? Or do we fear
contamination of our supposed purity of vision and beneficence?
Strikingly, [Washington's latest favorite interpretation of why
relations with China are poor is because we were somehow guilty of an
"overgenerous assumption" that, if we were nice to Beijing, then they
would become just like us.]{.underline} We deceived ourselves; we were
naïve. It's a fairly self-serving argument: if we bear any blame for bad
relations with Beijing, it is because we were too nice. Well, no more
Mr. Nice Guy. I'm not suggesting that the answer to all these questions
invariably comes down to "blame America." I'm just suggesting that maybe
we should be a little less utterly self-absorbed, self-righteous and
self-referential to consider that maybe it takes two to tango, or not
tango. [Sadly, sole superpowers are never going to welcome the rise of
any competitor in any arena; it nearly automatically becomes an official
"threat."]{.underline} There seems to be no other way to look at the
world except through this lens of American exceptionalism and the divine
right of American leadership. Not to mention the massive
military-industrial complex and the Beltway security bureaucracy that
have a vested interests in sustaining this worldview. How do we ever
wriggle out of these deeply ingrained habits of sole superpowerdom?
Frankly, I'm not sure it can be done, short of a massive shock to the
system that compels a rearrangement of our perceptions and priorities,
including budgets. I'm not holding my breath.
