MARY LAW REVIEW, Vol. 53:389. 2011\]

This Essay argues that [[politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} may sometimes
[**strategically [manipulate]{.mark}** the contours of the
**President's** constitutional **[authority]{.mark}** in order [to
achieve **partisan objectives**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [At first
glance]{.underline}, the notion that societal groups may ever stake out
conflicting visions of presidential authority seems puzzling. After all,
[it is difficult to envision how any view of presidential authority can
systematically confer one-sided benefits]{.underline} on any partisan or
interest group, because presumably each group will sometimes lose and
gain from any particular constraint on presidential authority. Thus,
given the implicit veil of ignorance that underpins the separation of
powers, one may think that the incentives of judges and elected
officials to embrace visions of presidential authority that advance the
specific objectives of any political party will be blunted.
Unsurprisingly, [much]{.underline} of the [contemporary
[scholarship]{.mark} on presidential power has **[ignored partisan
factors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and has instead focused on how
incentives **inherent** in the **institutional nature** of]{.underline}
the various [branches]{.underline} of government [shape]{.underline}
preferences for expansive [presidential authority]{.underline}.2

[This Essay suggests a **contrary view**]{.underline}: if certain
conditions hold, [[partisan power holders]{.mark} can often [calculate
how]{.mark} an **expansive or narrow** view of presidential [authority
over]{.mark} **discrete [issues]{.mark}** [is likely to affect their
electoral]{.mark} and ideological [objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. More
specifically, [staking out partisan positions on the allocation of
presidential authority is likely to be rational when such [authority can
be **unbundled**]{.mark} on an **[issue-by-issue]{.mark}
basis**]{.underline}.3 Under these conditions, [[parties]{.mark} are
likely to **[favor]{.mark}** a vision of **presidential
[authority]{.mark}** [that will **enable them** to **carry out**
]{.mark}those [**issues** in which **they have** an **electoral
advantage**]{.mark} over the opposition]{.underline}, [but that make it
**more difficult** for the **opposition** to **carry out** its favored
**issues**]{.underline}. For instance, [when]{.underline} the
presidential [[authority to negotiate]{.mark} human rights [**treaties**
can be]{.mark}]{.underline} effectively [**[unbundled]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**-[making
**[power]{.mark}**, [Republicans]{.mark} [may prefer more
**constraints**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the President's treatymaking
authority in human rights, [[but less on]{.underline}]{.mark} his
[**[war]{.mark}**-making]{.underline} authority.4 By contrast, Democrats
or left-leaning constituencies will likely adopt the opposite set of
preferences regarding presidential authority on war and human rights.
Similarly, Democratic administrations may be more willing to indulge a
greater role for courts in adjudicating human rights controversies even
at the expense of the President's interpretive discretion over
international law, whereas Republican administrations are more likely to
view such adjudications as interfering with the President's flexibility
to conduct foreign affairs.5

Pennsylvania (Michael, with Sarah Kreps and Matthew Fuhrman, "Separating
Fact from Fiction in the Debate over Drone Proliferation," International
Security, Vol. 41, No. 2 (Fall 2016), pp. 7--42, dml)

This article assesses the consequences of current-generation drone
proliferation, concluding that both of the above perspectives are
misguided. Examining the effects of UAVs in six different
contexts---counterterrorism, interstate conflict, crisis onset and
deterrence, coercive diplomacy, domestic control and repression, and use
by nonstate actors for the purposes of terrorism---we show that,
[[although]{.mark} current-generation [drones]{.mark} will [introduce
**some**]{.mark} **[unique capabilities]{.mark}** into conflicts around
the world, [they are **unlikely to produce**]{.mark} **the [dire
consequences]{.mark}** that some analysts fear]{.underline}. In
particular, drone proliferation carries potentially significant
consequences for counterterrorism operations and domestic control in
authoritarian regimes. Drones lower the costs of using force by
eliminating the risk that pilots will be killed, making some states---
especially democracies, which may be especially casualty
sensitive---more likely to carry out targeted attacks against suspected
militants. In addition, using drones could provide autocratic leaders
with a new tool to bolster their domestic regime security.8

Yet, [in general, current-generation drones [are likely to have a
**minimal impact** on interstate relations]{.mark}. Armed or advanced
unarmed drones are **[unlikely to provoke]{.mark} international
[crises]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} **incite regional
[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition, [current-generation
drones [offer **little utility for coercion**]{.mark} against other
governments]{.underline}. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, moreover,
[drones [might **enhance security** in disputed border regions by
providing]{.mark} states with a **greater [ability to monitor contested
regions]{.mark}** persistently at lower cost. Monitoring can [help to
**reassure states** that]{.mark} potential [adversaries are not
attempting to change the status quo]{.mark} through force]{.underline}.
The limited significance of current-generation drones in interstate
contexts beyond monitoring stems from a key technological limitation:
drones currently in operation are vulnerable to air defense systems, so
they are much less likely to be effective when operating in hostile
airspace.9

[With]{.underline} President-elect Donald [Trump]{.underline} poised to
become commander-in-chief, a number of [debates have arisen
about]{.underline} the legacies that will be left behind by his
predecessor and the ways those legacies shape the options available to
Trump. Last month in an interview, President Obama outlined five moments
that he believed defined his presidency. One of them involved the use of
[drones]{.underline} to track and kill suspected militants. In a world
where a U.S. president has an arsenal of drones at his or her disposal,
Obama recalled, America will soon find itself with a president who can
carry on perpetual wars all over the world, "and a lot of them covert,
without any accountability or democratic debate."

The notion that drones make it easier for leaders to use military force
has raised questions about the proliferation of drones globally, from
groups like Human Rights Watch concerned about illicit uses of force to
debates in the U.S. government about how to balance proliferation
concerns and export policy choices. Discussion of these issues is
understandable --- [the United States is perceived as having been
relatively unconstrained with its use of drones around the
world]{.underline}. President Obama stated that drones have become a
ubiquitous ingredient in our strategy for combatting counterterrorism
and are likely to remain so.

What would the world look like if drones played a similarly large role
for all modern militaries? This is an important question not just
because of the recent U.S. election -- which produced a president-elect
who will begin formulating a vision for American foreign policy -- but
also global trends.

Almost a dozen countries now have armed drones. Countries like China and
Israel have become major drone exporters. Armed drones are becoming an
increasingly mainstream capability.

[There are two major schools of thought]{.underline} on the impact of
drone proliferation. The first, primarily made up of
[skeptics]{.underline} about drone strikes outside the U.S. government,
[suggests that the consequences would be dismal]{.underline}. This view
holds that other countries would extrapolate from the U.S. experience
and be more inclined to carry out drone strikes of their own, leading to
enormous ripple effects -- especially in East Asia and the Middle East.

[Another perspective]{.underline}, however, [is]{.underline} somewhat
[more sanguine about drone proliferation. [Drones]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to this view, [[do not change]{.mark} the
[decision]{.mark}-making [calculus]{.mark} [for]{.mark} states
contemplating the use of [force]{.mark}]{.underline}. As former Director
of Central Intelligence and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated in
his memoirs

[To call our campaign against Al Qaeda a "drone program" is a little
like calling World War I a "machine gun program."]{.underline}
Technology has always been an aspect of war...what is most crucial is
not the size of the missile or the ability to deploy it from thousands
of miles away" \[but how the munitions are used\].

In a newly-published article in International Security, we evaluate
these two competing perspectives. It turns out, the reality is more
context-specific than either side in the drone debate has acknowledged.
We examine the consequences of current-generation drone proliferation in
six different contexts --- counterterrorism, interstate conflict, crisis
onset and deterrence, coercive diplomacy, domestic control and
repression, and use by non-state actors for the purposes of terrorism --
to see how the increasing use of drones might change military outcomes,
or even the global balance of power.

Counterterrorism: The operational advantages of drones, including their
precision and low risk to their operators, have made drones invaluable
to the United States for counterterrorism, and they will likely prove
useful to other countries for similar purposes. Drones are effective
here in part because regions where counterterrorism strikes are most
active, whether Gaza, the tribal regions of Pakistan, or Yemen, lack
sophisticated air defenses that are otherwise quite lethal against
drones that fly low and slow.

Interstate conflict: [[Because of]{.mark} their [vulnerability to
anti-air defenses]{.mark}, current-generation [drones are likely to have
a minimal impact on]{.mark} interstate relations (or [internationalized
disputes]{.mark}]{.underline} like the one against the Islamic State).
Indeed, as Micah Zenko and Sarah Kreps point out, [drones [will be
unable to take and hold foreign territory]{.mark} because of limits to
current drones' range, speed, and lethality]{.underline}. And because
[they, like other forms of airpower, cannot take and hold territory on
their own.]{.underline}

Crisis onset and deterrence: There are reasons to think that [drones
[could be a stabilizing force in]{.mark} some types of [border
disputes]{.mark}, especially those among interstate rivals. Drones could
[give both sides in a crisis real-time information]{.mark} about the
situation at lower cost]{.underline} than inhabited intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets -- especially for
countries without the extensive ISR capabilities of the United States --
[[and]{.mark} with [lower risk to personnel]{.mark}, than is possible at
present]{.underline}. Similarly, [drones [could decrease the ability of
potential aggressors to conduct surprise attacks]{.mark}. [With the aid
of surveillance drones]{.mark}, potential [targets may]{.mark} be more
likely to [see attacks coming and prepare accordingly]{.mark}.
Drones]{.underline}, then, [may be useful for deterrence by denial: If
the potential aggressor is dependent on the element of surprise, but
knows that drones flying near the border would give the other side
adequate notice, it may be less likely to launch an attack]{.underline}.

**Drone collisions/crashes don't escalate**

**Horowitz, et al, 16**---associate professor of political science and
associate director of Perry World House at the University of
Pennsylvania (Michael, with Sarah Kreps and Matthew Fuhrman, "Separating
Fact from Fiction in the Debate over Drone Proliferation," International
Security, Vol. 41, No. 2 (Fall 2016), pp. 7--42, dml)

The concerns outlined above certainly have merit. Still, [[it is
important not to overstate the risk]{.mark} of drone deployments for
regional or international stability]{.underline}. For example, [[none of
the]{.mark} aforementioned [incidents led to armed military
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the contrary, [emerging [norms
regarding]{.mark} the [consequences of shooting]{.mark} down [a
drone]{.mark}, though clearly still in the early stages,
[suggest]{.mark} that [states distinguish between]{.mark} the shooting
down of [manned and unmanned systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [even
if there is an accident and a drone is brought down, [it is less likely
to trigger a crisis or]{.mark} military [escalation]{.mark} than those
in the pessimistic camp imply]{.underline}. For example, [when Pakistan
shot down an Indian surveillance drone]{.underline} in the Kashmir
region in the summer of 2015 that it said strayed beyond the line of
control, [India did not escalate the long-simmering conflict to
war]{.underline}.106 Similarly, [compare the muted international
discussion when Turkey shot down a drone]{.underline} flying on its
border with Syria in the fall of 2015 [with the diplomatic crisis
between Turkey and Russia that erupted when Turkey brought down a manned
SU-24]{.underline}.107 [[Countries]{.underline}]{.mark} appear to
[[know]{.mark} that [opponents will value drones differently]{.mark}
from manned aircraft, [and behave accordingly]{.mark}. Thus, drones
carrying out surveillance and reconnaissance missions need not be
destabilizing]{.underline}. This may not always be the

"The Jurisprudence Of American National Security Presiprudence",
<http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&context=vulr>\]

Supreme Court [Justices]{.underline}---along with legal
advocates---[need to]{.underline} conceptualize and
[prioritize]{.underline} big theoretical matters of institutional design
and form and function in the American [national security]{.underline}
tripartite constitutional system. By way of an excellent introduction to
these vital issues of legal theory, the Justices should pull down from
the library shelf of the sumptuous Supreme Court Library in Washington,
D.C. (or more likely have a clerk do this chore) the old chestnut, The
Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law by
the late Harvard University law professors Henry M. Hart and Albert M.
Sacks.7 Among the rich insights on institutional design coupled with
form and function in the American legal system that are germane to the
Court's interpretation of national security law-making and
decision-making by the President are several pertinent points. First,
"Hart and Sacks' intellectual starting point was the interconnectedness
of human beings, and the usefulness of law in helping us coexist
peacefully together."8 By implication, therefore, [the Court should be
mindful]{.underline} [of the **unique**]{.underline} constitutional
**[role]{.underline}** [played by the POTUS \[president of the United
States\] in **preserving peace**]{.underline} [and should
prevent]{.underline} [imprudent judicial actions that would]{.underline}
**[undermine]{.underline}** American **[national
security.]{.underline}** Second, Hart and Sacks, continuing their broad
insights of social theory, noted that legal communities establish
"institutionalized\[\] procedures for the settlement of questions of
group concern"9 and regularize "different procedures and personnel of
different qualifications . . . appropriate for deciding different kinds
of questions"10 because "every modern society differentiates among
social questions, accepting one mode of decision for one kind and other
modes for others---e.g., courts for 'judicial' decisions and
legislatures for 'legislative' decisions"11 and, extending their
conceptualization, an executive for "executive" decisions.12 Third,
Professors Hart and Sacks made seminal theoretical distinctions between
rules, standards, principles, and policies.13 While all four are part of
"legal arrangements in an organized society,"14 and all four of these
arrangements are potentially relevant in [judicial review of
presidential national security decisions]{.underline}, principles and
policies15 **[are of special concern]{.underline}** [because of the
sprawling,]{.underline} inchoate, **[and rapidly changing]{.underline}**
[nature of]{.underline} national **[security threats]{.underline}** [and
the]{.underline} **[imperative]{.underline}** [of
hyper-energy]{.underline} [in the Executive]{.underline} branch **[in
responding]{.underline}** to these threats.16 The Justices should also
consult Professor Robert S. Summers's masterful elaboration and
amplification of the Hart and Sacks project on enhancing a flourishing
legal system: the 2006 opus, Form and Function in a Legal System: A
General Study. 17 The most important points that Summers makes that are
relevant to judicial review of American national security presiprudence
are three key considerations. First, a \"conception of the overall form
of the whole of a functional \[legal\] unit is needed to serve the
founding purpose of defining, specifying, and organizing the makeup of
such a unit so that it can be brought into being and can fulfill its own
distinctive role\"18 in synergy with other legal units to serve
overarching sovereign purposes for a polity. [The]{.underline} American
[constitutional system]{.underline} of national security law and policy
[should be appreciated for its]{.underline} **[genius]{.underline}** [in
making the POTUS the national security sentinel with vast,]{.underline}
but not unlimited, [powers to protect the Nation from
**hostile**]{.underline}, potentially **[catastrophic]{.underline}**,
**[threats]{.underline}**. Second, \"a conception of the overall form of
the whole is needed for the purpose of organizing the internal unify of
relations between various formal features of a functional \[legal\] unit
and between each formal feature and the complementary components of the
whole unit.\"19 Thus, Supreme Court Justices should have a thick
understanding of the form of national security decision- making
conceived by the Founders to center in the POTUS; the ways the POTUS and
Congress historically organized the processing of national security
through institutions like the National Security Council and the House
and Senate intelligence committees; and the ways the POTUS has
structured national security process through such specific legal forms
as Presidential Directives, National Security Decision Directives,
National Security Presidential Decision Directives, Presidential
Decision Directives, and National Security Policy Directives in
classified, secret documents along with typically public Executive
Orders.20 Third, according to Summers, \"a conception of the overall
form of the whole functional (legal\] unit is needed to organize further
the mode of operation and the instrumental capacity of the \[legal\]
unit.\"21 So, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Supreme [[Court should be aware
that **tinkering** with]{.underline} **[national security decisions of
the]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**POTUS** \[[president]{.mark} of the United
States\]]{.underline} ---unless clearly necessary to counterbalance an
indubitable violation of the text of the Constitution---[[may lead

**[second-order]{.underline}** **[[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[in the ability of the POTUS]{.underline} (with or without the help of
Congress) [to]{.underline} preserve, protect, and **[defend the
Nation]{.underline}**.22 \[\*886\] B. Geopolitical Strategic
Considerations Bearing on Judicial Interpretation Before the United
States Supreme Court Justices form an opinion on the legality of
national security decisions by the POTUS, they should immerse themselves
in judicially-noticeable facts concerning what national security expert,
Bruce Berkowitz, in the subtitle of his recent book, calls the
\"challengers, competitors, and threats to America\'s future.\" n23 Not
that the Justices need to become experts in national security affairs,
n24 but every Supreme Court Justice should be aware of the following
five basic national security facts and conceptions before sitting in
judgment on presiprudential national security determinations. (1)
\"[[National security]{.underline}]{.mark} policy . . . [[is
harder]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} the
issues that are involved are more numerous and varied. [[The
problem]{.underline}]{.mark} of the [day [can change at a moment\'s
notice]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" n25 While \"\[y\]esterday, it might have
been **[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration; today,
[**[terrorism]{.underline}**;]{.mark} tomorrow, **[hostile [regional
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" n26, the twenty-first century reality is
that [\"\[t\]hreats are also more likely to be
intertwined\--proliferators use the same networks as narco-traffickers,
narco-traffickers support terrorists, and terrorists align themselves
with regional powers]{.underline}.\" n27 (2) \"Yet, as worrisome as
these immediate concerns may be, the long-term challenges are even
harder to deal with, and the stakes are higher. Whereas the main Cold
War threat\--the Soviet Union\--was brittle, most of the potential
adversaries and challengers America now faces are resilient.\" n28 (3)
\"The most important task for U.S. national security today is simply to
retain the strategic advantage. This term, from the world of military
doctrine, refers to the overall ability of a nation to control, or at
least influence, the course of events.\" n29 Importantly, \"\[w\]hen you
hold \[\*887\] the strategic advantage, situations unfold in your favor,
and each round ends so that you are in an advantageous position for the
next. When you do not hold the strategic advantage, they do not.\" n30
(4) While \"keeping the strategic advantage may not have the idealistic
ring of making the world safe for democracy and does not sound as
decisively macho as maintaining American hegemony,\" n31 [maintaining
the]{.underline} American \"**[strategic advantage is
critical]{.underline}**, [because it is essential for just about
everything else America hopes to achieve]{.underline}\--promoting
freedom, protecting the homeland, defending its values, **[preserving
peace]{.underline}**, and so on.\" n32 (5) **[[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[requires national security \"agility]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" n33
It not only needs \"to refocus its resources repeatedly; it needs to do
this faster than an adversary can focus its own resources.\" n34
\[\*888\] As further serious preparation for engaging in the
jurisprudence of American national security presiprudence in hotly
contested cases and controversies that may end up on their docket, our
Supreme Court Justices should understand that, as Walter Russell Mead
pointed out in an important essay a few years ago, n35 the average
American can be understood as a Jacksonian pragmatist on national
security issues. n36 \"Americans are determined to keep the world at a
distance, while not isolating ourselves from it completely. If we need
to take action abroad, we want to do it on our terms.\" n37 Thus, recent
social science survey data paints \"a picture of a country whose
practical people take a practical approach to knowledge about national
security. Americans do not bother with the details most of the time
because, for most Americans, the details do not matter most the time.\"
n38 Indeed, since the American people \"do know the outlines of the big
picture and what we need to worry about \[in national security affairs\]
so we know when we need to pay greater attention and what is at stake.
This is the kind of knowledge suited to a Jacksonian.\" n39 Turning to
how the Supreme Court should view and interpret American presidential
measures to oversee national security law and policy, our Justices
should consider a number of important points. First, given the robust
text, tradition, intellectual history, and evolution of the institution
of the POTUS as the American national security sentinel, n40 and the
unprecedented dangers to the United States national security after 9/11,
n41 [national security presiprudence should be accorded **wide
latitude** by the Court]{.underline} in the adjustment (and tradeoffs)
of trading liberty and security. n42 Second, Justices should be aware
that different presidents \[\*889\] institute changes in national
security presiprudence given their unique perspective and knowledge of
threats to the Nation. n43 Third, **[[Justices should be restrained in
second-guessing the]{.mark} POTUS \[[president]{.mark} of the United
States\]]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} his subordinate [national
security experts]{.underline} concerning both the existence and duration
of national security emergencies and necessary measures to rectify them.
\"[During emergencies, the institutional advantages of the executive are
enhanced]{.underline}\", n44 moreover, \"\[[[b\]ecause of the importance
of]{.underline} **[secrecy, speed, and flexibility]{.underline}**,
**[courts, which are slow]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, open, [and
rigid]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [have less to
contribute]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the formulation of national policy
than they do during normal times]{.underline}.\" n45 Fourth, Supreme
Court Justices, of course, should not give the POTUS a blank
check\--even during times of claimed national emergency; but, how much
deference to be accorded by the Court is \"always a hard question\" and
should be a function of \"the scale and type of the emergency.\" n46
Fifth, [the [Court should be]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[extraordinarily
deferential]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to the POTUS]{.underline} and his
executive subordinates [regarding]{.underline} questions of [executive
determinations]{.underline} [of the international laws of war and
military tactics]{.underline}. As cogently explained by Professors Eric
Posner and Adrian Vermeule, n47 \"the United States should comply with
the laws of war in its battle against Al Qaeda\"\--and I would argue,
other lawless terrorist groups like the Taliban\--\"only to the extent
these laws are beneficial to the United States, taking into account the
likely response of \[\*890\] other states and of al Qaeda and other
terrorist organizations,\" n48 as determined by the POTUS and his
national security executive subordinates.

it is only because Congress has chosen not to exercise its easy check.
We should not confuse a desire to escape political responsibility for a

to the aforementioned governments, the U.S. may be compelled to fight
wars similar to the war in Afghanistan. [[Conflict with another state

potential threat posed by a **non-state actor**]{.mark} acquiring such
weapons,]{.underline} [form conditions that indicate a strong
possibility of war.]{.underline} In particular, Iran's nuclear program
presents a potentially ominous window. Should diplomacy, sanctions, and
cyber attacks fail to sidetrack Iran's nuclear program, [the U.S. will
be presented with an ever-narrowing window to act with
force]{.underline} to deny Iran this capability. This could result in
conflict with Iran. While false optimism is a potent and pervasive cause
of war, [recent experience with war and the nature of these and likely
future conflicts will diminish leaders support for initiating
war.]{.underline} Similarly, [the current economic conditions and
concern over the national debt will dampen leaders' enthusiasm for
wars]{.underline}. But [existing theories that discuss these factors
fail to consider the impact of non-state actors]{.underline}.
[Thus]{.underline}, **[conflict is still possible despite

indicate]{.underline} [continuing conflict with nonstate
actors]{.underline} [and]{.underline} potential [conflict with states

nuclear weapons. [[These factors]{.mark} identify specific circumstances

As horrible as this would be, such a pandemic is by no means the worst
attack one can imagine, for several reasons. First, [most]{.underline}
of the [[classic bioweapons are based on]{.underline}]{.mark} 1960s and
[[1970s tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology because the 1972 treaty halted
bioweapons development efforts in the United States and most other
Western countries. Second, the Russians, although solidly committed to
biological weapons long after the treaty deadline, were never on the
cutting edge of biological research. Third and most important, [the
science]{.underline} and technology [of [molecular bio]{.mark}logy have
[made enormous advances]{.mark}]{.underline}, utterly **[[transforming
the field]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the last few decades. High school
biology students routinely perform molecular-biology manipulations that
would have been impossible even for the best superpower-funded program
back in the heyday of biological-weapons research. The biowarfare
methods of the 1960s and 1970s are now as antiquated as the lumbering
mainframe computers of that era. [Tomorrow's [terrorists will have
vastly more deadly bugs]{.mark} to choose from]{.underline}. Consider
this sobering development: in 2001, Australian researchers working on
Mousepox, a nonlethal virus that infects mice (as chickenpox does in
humans), accidentally discovered that a simple genetic modification
transformed the virus.10, 11 instead of producing mild symptoms, the new
virus killed 60% of even those mice already immune to the naturally
occurring strains of Mousepox. The new virus, moreover, was unaffected
by any existing vaccine or antiviral drug. a team of researchers at
saint Louis University led by mark Buller picked up on that work and, by
late 2003, found a way to improve on it: Buller's variation on Mousepox
was 100% lethal, although his team of investigators also devised
combination vaccine and antiviral therapies that were partially
effective in protecting animals from the engineered strain.12, 13
Another saving grace is that the genetically altered virus is no longer
contagious. Of course, it is quite possible that future tinkering with
the virus will change that property, too. Strong reasons exist to
believe that the genetic modifications Buller made to Mousepox would
work for other poxviruses and possibly for other classes of viruses as
well. Might the same techniques allow chickenpox or another poxvirus
that infects humans to be turned into a 100% lethal bioweapon, perhaps
one that is resistant to any known antiviral therapy? I've asked this
question of experts many times, and no one has yet replied that such a
manipulation couldn't be done. This case is just one example. Many more
are pouring out of scientific journals and conferences every year. Just
last year, the journal Nature published a controversial study done at
the University of Wisconsin--Madison in which virologists enumerated the
changes one would need to make to a highly lethal strain of bird flu to
make it easily transmitted from one mammal to another.14
[[Biotech]{.mark}nology [is advancing so rapidly that it is hard to keep
track of]{.mark} all the new [potential threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Nor is it clear that anyone is even trying. In addition to lethality and
drug resistance, many other parameters can be played with, given that
the infectious power of an epidemic depends on many properties,
including the length of the latency period during which a person is
contagious but asymptomatic. Delaying the onset of serious symptoms
allows each new case to spread to more people and thus makes the virus
harder to stop. This dynamic is perhaps best illustrated by hiv, which
is very difficult to transmit compared with smallpox and many other
viruses. Intimate contact is needed, and even then, the infection rate
is low. The balancing factor is that hiv can take years to progress to
aids, which can then take many more years to kill the victim. What makes
hiv so dangerous is that infected people have lots of opportunities to
infect others. This property has allowed hiv to claim more than 30
million lives so far, and approximately 34 million people are now living
with this virus and facing a highly uncertain future.15 [[A
virus]{.mark} genetically [engineered to infect]{.mark} its host
[quickly,]{.mark} to [generate symptoms
slowly]{.mark}]{.underline}---say, only after weeks or months---and to
spread easily through the air or by casual contact would be vastly more
devastating than hiv. It could silently penetrate the population to
unleash its deadly effects suddenly. This type of epidemic [[would be
almost impossible to combat]{.mark} because most of the infections would
occur before the epidemic became obvious]{.underline}. A technologically
sophisticated terrorist group could develop such a virus and kill a
large part of humanity with it. Indeed, terrorists may not have to
develop it themselves: some scientist may do so first and publish the
details. Given the rate at which biologists are making discoveries about
viruses and the immune system, at some point [in the near future,
someone may create artificial [pathogens]{.mark} that [could **drive the
human race to extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, a detailed
species-elimination plan of this nature was openly proposed in a
scientific journal. The ostensible purpose of that particular research
was to suggest a way to extirpate the malaria mosquito, but similar
techniques could be directed toward humans.16 When I've talked to
molecular biologists about this method, they are quick to point out that
it is slow and easily detectable and could be fought with biotech
remedies. If you challenge them to come up with improvements to the
suggested attack plan, however, they have plenty of ideas. [Modern
[biotech]{.mark}nology [will soon be capable]{.mark}]{.underline}, if it
is not already, [[of bringing about the demise of the human race--- or
at least]{.mark} of killing a sufficient number of people to
[end]{.mark} high-tech [civilization]{.mark} and set humanity back 1,000
years]{.underline} or more. That terrorist groups could achieve this
level of technological sophistication may seem far-fetched, but keep in
mind that it takes only a handful of individuals to accomplish these
tasks. Never has lethal power of this potency been accessible to so few,
so easily. Even more dramatically than nuclear proliferation, modern
biological science has frighteningly undermined the correlation between
the lethality of a weapon and its cost, a fundamentally stabilizing
mechanism throughout history. [[Access to extremely lethal
agents]{.underline}]{.mark}---lethal enough to exterminate Homo
sapiens---[[will be available]{.mark} to anybody with a solid background
in biology terrorists included]{.underline}.

The [[tensions stoked by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[assertive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square [[could
**spark a**]{.mark} **political or [military incident]{.mark}** [that
might set off a chain reaction leading to a]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[large-scale wa]{.mark}r]{.underline}**. Historically, powerful
rivalries nearly always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown
war. [The anomalous Cold War era]{.underline} **[spared]{.underline}**
the United States and Soviet Russia a direct conflict, largely from
concerns that one would trigger a **[nuclear exchange

repetition **might** reoccur in the unfolding]{.underline}
three-cornered [geopolitical world]{.underline}. It seems safe to
acknowledge that an ascendant China and a resurgent Russia will persist
in their geo-strategic ambitions. What Is To Be Done? The first marching
order is to dodge any kind of perpetual war of the sort that George
Orwell outlined in "1984," which engulfed the three super states of
Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania, and made possible the totalitarian Big
Brother regime. A long-running Cold War-type confrontation would almost
certainly take another form than the one that ran from 1945 until the
downfall of the Soviet Union. What prescriptions can be offered in the
face of the escalating competition among the three global powers? First,
[[by **staying militarily**]{.mark} **and economically
[strong]{.mark}**[, the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will]{.mark} have the resources to

**Unrestrained SOF solves all impacts, restricting it wrecks
effectiveness**

5 Multiscale Military Theory and the Functional Role of SOF [Much like
an organism, our [global civilization is composed of]{.mark} a set of
[distinct social tissues]{.mark}, each with unique character, mode of
internal operation, and interfaces with other tissues. [Healthy]{.mark},
well-functioning social [tissues have internal behaviors that
**sustain**]{.mark} **the individuals composing [them]{.mark}**[, such
as **ag**]{.mark}**riculture**, **goods
[production]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[trading]{.underline}** and
[**[markets]{.underline}**, **[health]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[services]{.underline}**, **[social]{.underline}**
[gatherings]{.underline} and celebrations, [as well as fruitful external
interactions with other social systems such as the [buying and
selling]{.mark} of **commodities, products, and services**.
[When]{.mark} healthy and functional [social tissue is disrupted,
opportunities are created for **malignant forces**]{.mark} to gain
footholds and grow. This dynamic can be seen,]{.underline} for instance,
[in the unintended consequences of the invasion of **Iraq**, which
created the opportunity for terrorist networks and other harmful actors
to increase their power and influence as normal life was disrupted and
power vacuums were created]{.underline}. Moreover, the harm and risks
generated by the growth of malignant forces are not confined to the
local area where they first manifest. [Because of our global
interconnectedness and interdependence, [effects cascade causing
**disruption in other tissues**]{.mark}, [leading to a **domino effect**
with]{.mark} no straightforward mechanism to halt the **[expanding
impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[11,12\]. [The recent and ongoing
**migrant crisis in Europe and beyond** provides an example of one form
such cascading effects can take. Global [interdependency means
any]{.mark}]{.underline} **[large-scale]{.underline}** military
[[intervention]{.mark}, by virtue of disrupting the normal functioning
of society, [will generate]{.mark} both local and **[non-local
unintended consequences]{.mark}** even when desired effects are
achieved]{.underline}. This is not to suggest that large-scale action is
never necessary, but the potential for generating new crises must be
weighed carefully whenever it is considered as an option. In many cases,
action that does not disrupt local, healthy social behavior is possible,
but it requires the right action and agent. The parallels of the effects
of tissue disruption in organisms and in sociocultural systems
highlights the need for a 'sociocultural immune system'---a finegrained
system for sensing and acting on environmental disturbances at scales
smaller than conventional forces are able. [In this regard, conventional
forces can be likened to the large-scale neuromuscular system in
organisms]{.underline}. Acting instead at a small-scale presents the
possibility of maintaining healthy social tissue and allowing it to
flourish. [Just as for the immune system, this is not a matter of
differentiating 'native' and 'foreign', but understanding whether an
agent is disruptive to overall health. [SOF are **uniquely
positioned**]{.mark} to fulfill this role, possessing the requisite
**personnel**]{.underline}, **[skills]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
[**training**. For this to be realized, policies that impact SOF must be
such that they enable their **unique capabilities** in meeting the high
complexity demand of **local cultural systems**]{.underline}. We
identify three conditions that must be satisfied in order for SOF to
serve such a role: special operators with advanced training and
distinctive capabilities, persistent presence and enduring engagements,
and local autonomy and decision-making. We discuss each in turn. 5.1
Distinctive Capabilities [Much like the cells in the immune system have
special forms and functions to fulfill their roles, the distinctive
capabilities of special operators enable them to operate in **highly
complex sociocultural environments**. Advanced **language and cultural
training** allows **unmediated interaction with local peoples**. Special
operators' experience in making decisions in the face of uncertainty
allow them to operate in ill-defined 'gray zone'
conditions.]{.underline} The need to produce special operators with
distinctive capabilities highlights the role of SOF's
high-selectiveness, and emphasizes the necessity of advanced training in
language and culture in addition to combat. These values are articulated
in the SOF truths "Humans are more important than hardware" and "SOF
cannot be mass produced" \[13\]. Preparing special operators to interact
directly and make difficult decisions in complex psychosocial,
sociocultural, and kinetic environments must be a priority of SOF and
their enabling agencies. 5.2 Persistent Presence [The immune system is
embedded throughout the tissues of the body to develop and maintain
sensitivity to the character of local tissue and respond rapidly to
disruptors]{.underline} \[14\]. Similarly, [**persistent presence** of
SOF allows for **nuanced relationships to unfold over time**, and for
**cultural attunement**]{.underline} [to be developed at both the
individual and institutional levels. SOF embeddedness engenders an
understanding of normal conditions and a sensitivity to
changes]{.underline} in those conditions and whether they pose a threat.
[Moreover, presence is necessary for applying **rapid and effective
action** to achieve desired effects with minimal
disruption]{.underline}. Just as SOF must recognize 'self' in multiple
contexts, local cultures must not react to SOF as a foreign entity, i.e.
mutual trust must be present, developed through shared history. Policies
should enhance continuity of interaction between SOF and a given
sociocultural system even, or especially, when there is no immediate or
visible threat. The only way to prevent the growth of malignancies is to
be present and active before they grow. This is reflected in the SOF
truth "competent SOF cannot be created after emergencies occur" \[13\]
and Admiral William McRaven's oft-cited comment that one "can't surge
trust" \[15\]. 5.3 Local Autonomy and Decision-Making [As the cells of
the immune system sense, decide, and act locally in a decentralized
manner, being fine-tuned to the character of their local tissues, so too
must [**SOF** have the ability to **sense, decide, and act
locally**]{.mark} using their nuanced understanding and experience. The
[semi-**autonomy** of SOF is **necessary**]{.mark}]{.underline} for
requisite variety to be achieved in interfacing with high-complexity,
fine-grained environments and disruptors. In human systems, these
disruptors manifest at the psychosocial and sociocultural scales. [It is
possible to take effective action at these scales to eliminate harmful
agents without disrupting healthy social tissue
functioning.]{.underline} This becomes impossible as the scale of a
malignancy grows larger: social tissue will inevitably be damaged by
both the malignancy itself and any large-scale force applied in
response. [[When the **decision-making agent** is]{.mark} both
**[far]{.mark} removed [from]{.mark}** and **insensitive** to the [local
context]{.mark}, as well as receiving multiple information streams about
which decisions must be made, [the **sensitivity**, **nuance**, and
**understanding**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **local** [SOF is
lost]{.mark}.]{.underline} Consequently, the ability to stem malignant
forces while they remain small in scale is diminished, and the
likelihood of disrupting a social system either accidentally or out of
necessity as the scale of harmful actors grows larger increases. [To
enable SOF to act without disrupting social tissue, the
**[institutions]{.mark} overseeing SOF [must not over-constrain their
behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As policy- and decisionmakers look
increasingly to SOF to overcome complex challenges, it is critical that
they do not become overly-bureaucratized. Imperatives that are
communicated to SOF must be guided by their role as a protector of local
tissue function. Protections from the potential for harm to local
tissues, i.e. by civilian collateral damage from operations, must be
instituted in a way that retains local autonomy. Detailed instructions
on how to carry out missions will prevent them from behaving as
necessary for success in highcomplexity environments. In technical
terms, placing too many constraints on their behavior will reduce their
variety below the (requisite) threshold for sensing and acting on
fine-grained disruptors. The consequences of this are twofold: (1) SOF
will lack the ability to sense and eliminate threats while they remain
small, and (2) disruption and destruction of healthy social tissue
becomes inevitable as malignant forces grow and large-scale intervention
becomes the only means of engagement. 6 Challenges and Implementation
While SOF are uniquely positioned to fulfill an immune-system-like
function, there remain significant challenges to successful
implementation. Here we summarize some of these challenges. [Developing
SOF who are]{.underline} both culturally and [**linguistically
competent**, as well as able to execute reconnaissance and surveillance
and direct action missions demands significant investment in training
and preparation]{.underline}. Moreover, for any individual operator
there is a tradeoff in developing proficiency in any given domain.
However, SOF must be able to perform the entire range of activities,
from sensing nuanced changes in social conditions to taking actions to
eliminate harmful disruptors, to preserving social tissue health.
Fundamental limitations on individual capabilities lead to a need for
diversification of roles of SOF. This is manifest already in different
types of SOF, as it is in the immune system which uses cells of various
types, each of which serves particular roles that complement one
another. The relative levels of activity for the different cell-types
vary depending on circumstance; some cells primarily sense tissue
conditions and detect disruptors, while others act to confine and
eliminate harmful agents once they are identified. During an infection
rapid clonal reproduction (replication) of effective types occurs.
Similarly, SOF may embrace and develop specialization of expertise, and
should be flexible enough to adapt force size and composition in
response to changing circumstances. Maintaining the mental health of
special operators must be a priority, and appropriate support systems
should be put in place for this. The high complexity of tasks translates
into the psychological symptoms of stress, depression and burnout,
common in a high complexity society more generally but surely for SOF.
Moreover, adapting to diverse local contexts creates challenges when
switching to home and family environments, a potential component of post
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is a challenge for both the SOF
and their families. Giving special operators a significant degree of
autonomy presents challenges and risks that are distinct from those of
conventional command-and-control systems. Care must be taken to ensure
social tissue is not damaged by unintentional friendly fire, collateral
damage or intentional 'rogue operators'. The potential for disfunction
is not unlike auto-immune disorders in complex organisms and the immune
system has developed mechanisms for prevention, though no mechanism is
failure proof. Local feedback systems including multiple specialized
roles rather than centralized control ones must be in place that put
checks on the actions of operators.The structure of these feedback
mechanisms must be the subject of intensive study. Rapid growth in
recent years has led to institutionalization of SOF using concepts that
may be incorrectly adopted from command control military traditions.
Bureaucratization runs counter to the ability of SOF for performing the
functions we have identified. Rather then enabling SOF function as it
grows, institutionalization may result in undermining the effectiveness
of SOF as it becomes more like conventional forces. Alternative
structures must be developed. They may be inferred from fundamental
complex systems analyses, including correspondence with immune system
functions or well designed experimentation. Institutional structures and
relationships between SOCOM and other enabling agencies, including those
within DoD, and other departments of the executive branch such as the
State Department, need to be carefully considered. For example, how the
agenda of an ambassador of a given region and local SOF should
interrelate is an open question. If command and control structures do
not appropriately interface with SOF, their unique capabilities will not
be utilized effectively. This includes knowing when and, crucially, when
not to utilize SOF to achieve a desired effect. This article is intended
to contribute to this clarification. 7 SOF in the 21st Century [There is
no doubt that as a global civilization we will continue to face
fine-grained, **[high-complexity disruptors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that
have the potential to **[grow into larger-scale malignancies]{.mark}**.
The only way to combat this is to promote and enable the flourishing of
healthy **social tissues**]{.underline}. [Multiscale control systems
theory makes clear the need for an immune-like system embedded within
human social systems. It must be sensitive to and embedded within
**high-complexity psychosocial and sociocultural environments** to make
decisions locally based on understanding of a given social system, its
nuances, and distinctive qualities. Like the various tissues arranged
into functional organs throughout the body, cultures and social systems
do not all look, behave, or function alike. Part of a global strategy
for the 21st century must be the recognition that cultures **can not
simply be 'exported' or 'projected' onto others without pushback**, and
that behavioral diversity at the collective scale is a natural and
healthy part of our human civilization]{.underline}. SOF possess the
unique organizational capabilities to be sensitive to the healthy
behavior of these diverse 'social tissues', while providing the direct
and indirect action capabilities to neutralize malignant forces when
identified. [Moving forward, a major part of the SOF repertoire must
include relationship building. **Interpersonal relationships with local
individuals**]{.underline} [form the **basis** of understanding
necessary to **discern between harmful and beneficial (or neutral)
forces to social health**. The ability to perceive and understand local
tensions, grievances, typical and atypical interactions, customs, and
other nuanced features can serve to generate solutions before the normal
functioning of healthy social tissue is threatened. The highly-complex
and fine-grained nature of this endeavor makes it an unsuitable role for
**conventional** forces -- they can not sense nor act on such a fine
scale. A focus on direct action is important when specific disruptors
have been identified, and not otherwise. [SOF is uniquely positioned to
serve as a **global immune system**]{.mark}, **keeping the diverse set
of social tissues healthy**, and reserving large-scale intervention for
when it is necessary.]{.underline}

**Bork and Rivkin, 5** - Robert H. Bork, a senior fellow at the Hudson
Institute, was solicitor general of the United States from 1973 to 1977
and later a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia. David B. Rivkin Jr. is a Washington lawyer who served in the
Justice Department in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations
("A War the Courts Shouldn\'t Manage" Washington Post, 1/21,

As speculation mounts about President Bush\'s nominees to the federal
judiciary, and particularly to the Supreme Court, one factor that should
be of paramount importance is too often overlooked. Curbing or reversing
the Supreme Court\'s usurpation of so many domestic issues is crucial.
But perhaps even [more important is avoiding judicial micromanagement of
America\'s war against]{.underline} radical Islamic [terrorists. Already
there are disturbing signs of [judicial overreaching]{.mark} that
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} constitutionally illegitimate and, in practical
terms, [[potentially debilitating]{.underline}]{.mark}. The vast
majority of war opponents and attorneys for captured terrorists are
pressing for a full-fledged criminal law model never before applied to
enemy combatants. Realizing that Congress and the president will not
adopt their position, these litigants are resorting to the federal
courts. Real abuses that inevitably occur in war, as well as in
peacetime prisons, are being punished by our military, but that does not
assuage critics who have an agenda other than justice. They allege that
the abuses stem from the administration\'s legal analysis and that the
analysis is contrary to the Constitution and to international norms.
That is wrong on both counts. A pair of confusing Supreme Court
decisions handed down June 28 plowed the ground for astounding
lower-court activism. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, involving a petition for habeas
corpus on behalf of a U.S. citizen held by the military as an enemy
combatant fighting in Afghanistan, was a qualified victory for the
government. The court approved the use of military tribunals but held
that Yaser Esam Hamdi must have an opportunity to contest his status as
an enemy combatant. It left unclear how that opportunity could be
exercised, and it is difficult to see how it could be without calling
witnesses from the combat zone, a procedure that would divert American
soldiers from waging war. Rasul v. Bush, on the other hand, was a
disaster for the war effort. Aliens held at Guantanamo Bay, not a part
of the United States or within the jurisdiction of any federal court,
were held to have a right to a habeas petition. The result would seem to
be that captured alien combatants held by the U.S. military anywhere in
the world can henceforth litigate their status in federal courts. [Some
[lower federal courts]{.mark} have [not resisted the temptation to
insert themselves further into the conduct of the war]{.mark}. In doing
so, they have interfered with the war effort]{.underline} while
fostering the false impression that the executive branch is trampling on
constitutional liberties. The district court\'s decision in Hamdan v.
Rumsfeld (2004) is a prime example. The judge applied the Geneva
Conventions in contradiction of the legal framework laid down in Hamdi,
misread the conventions and severely encroached upon the president\'s
war powers. In Omar Abu Ali v. Ashcroft (2004), another district court
outdid the Supreme Court by finding that it had, at least potentially,
authority to determine the legality of a foreign government\'s detention
of an accused dual-nationality terrorist because of an allegation that
the United States had prompted the detention. Nearly 70 years ago, the
court held in a famous decision (Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. v. United
States) that the executive branch\'s extensive prerogatives in foreign
affairs are grounded in its unique expertise, information and unitary
nature. [[Courts have neither the constitutional authority nor the
expertise an]{.mark}d information [to override the president\'s
determinations o]{.mark}n issues [such as whether we are in armed
conflict or what]{.mark} kind of [anti-terrorist cooperation we should
engage in wit]{.mark}h foreign governments]{.underline}. For obvious
reasons, [[the executive cannot share all the relevant information with
judges]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nor has the judiciary the necessary unitary
nature, unless every case is decided by the Supreme Court. Thus, in
addition to fighting legal battles in court, the administration would be
well-advised to make a far stronger public case for its detention
policies, which are designed not only to prevent enemy combatants from
returning to fight against us but also to obtain intelligence that might
save the lives of American soldiers and civilians as well as shorten the
war. Although current detention and interrogation procedures can surely
be improved, and additional safeguards against abuses should be adopted,
these ought to be matters for the political branches. Freezing policies
through constitutional rulings should be a last resort. The executive
and Congress, as circumstances change and experience accumulates, can
debate and resolve in a flexible manner the policy imperatives of
individual liberty and America\'s reputation overseas, on one hand, vs.
the demands of collective safety. But in doing so they must avoid
trampling on the president\'s constitutional prerogatives. Congress
should not lay down detailed prescriptions on what interrogation
techniques are appropriate. And it should resist the temptation to
grandstand; passing exhortations against torture is not the way to
proceed. Sensitivity to these matters and the crucial but limited role
of the judiciary should be taken into account in the choice of nominees
to the courts and in the confirmation process. [Too much is riding on
the outcome of this war]{.underline} \-- ultimately, perhaps, [the
survival of Western societies \-- to choose judges who are unaware of
the complexities of what is at stake]{.underline}.

controversies often requires immediate attention]{.mark}, and it may
prove costly for the political branches to await the outcome of a
judicial determination]{.underline}. Second, to the extent that a
determination will turn on whether the executive branch has produced
sufficient evidence to warrant the commencement of military hostilities
without congressional authorization, [the consequences of judicial error
can be]{.underline} extremely high, if not
**[catastrophic]{.underline}**. Imagine, for instance, that the Supreme
Court sets forth a standard for war powers controversies that requires
the President to demonstrate that a foreign country imposes an imminent
threat to national security before he can commence military hostilities
without congressional authorization[. [If]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the
Court errs in its assessment]{.mark} of the severity of an external
threat[, its judgment could leave the country]{.mark}
**[defenseless]{.mark} in the event of an attack.**]{.underline} Such
difficulties underscore an important difference \[\*993\] between
domestic controversies and foreign controversies. In a domestic
controversy, the costs of judicial error are rarely so immediate and
guaranteed to impact a wide number of the U.S. citizenry. It is also
true that in the domestic context, the courts often have ample
opportunity, over time, to correct any prior interpretive errors. This
risk of judicial error is implicit in the decisions that treated the
legality of the Vietnam War as a political question. For example, with
respect as to whether the President\'s decision to mine the harbors of
North Vietnam constituted an unauthorized escalation of war under the
War Powers Act, the Second Circuit articulated the risk of that court\'s
involvement in these terms: Judges, deficient in military knowledge,
lacking vital information upon which to assess the nature of battlefield
decisions, and sitting thousands of miles from the field of action,
cannot reasonably or appropriately determine whether a specific military
operation constitutes an \"escalation\" of the war or is merely a new
tactical approach within a continuing strategic plan \... Are the courts
required to oversee the conduct of the war on a daily basis, away from
the scene of action? In this instance, it was the President\'s view that
the mining of North Vietnam\'s harbors was necessary to preserve the
lives of American soldiers in South Vietnam and to bring the war to a
close. History will tell whether or not that assessment was correct, but
without the benefit of such extended hindsight we are powerless to know.
n225 Using this framework, the court concluded that political branches
were better equipped to handle the foreign affairs and war strategy
questions before it. One might object and argue that the circumstances
described above would only apply when war or imminent threats to
national security issues are at stake. While national security concerns
best illustrate the dangers of judicial intervention, framing this
factor exclusively in terms of war is not appropriate. First, as
explained in Section A above, it is often difficult to separate national
security issues from other soft diplomacy concerns. n226 Second, and
more importantly, [[the costs of judicial intervention stem n]{.mark}ot
so much [from the fact that]{.mark} war may be a factor, but that [the
courts are incapable of predicting]{.mark} whether foreign nations may
be affected by a judicial decision, or [how **such nations may react to
such a decision**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This latter consideration
extends to issues affecting international trade and commerce, as well as
international security. As explained by Justice Brennan in Container
\[\*994\] Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Board, n227 a case involving
a tax dispute, \"this Court has little competence in determining
precisely when foreign nations will be offended by particular acts.\"
n228 In the absence of a more precise understanding of the foreign
interests that may be adversely affected by a judicial determination,
the courts have appropriately left the resolution of such foreign
affairs disputes to the political branches. An objection to this
explanation might be that concerns regarding the effects of litigation
on unrelated parties often arise in the domestic context, but that
courts do not necessarily defer to the political branches in such cases.
For instance, some commentators have described the judicial role in the
prison reform litigation that started in the late 1960s as involving
complex and multifaceted consequences that extended beyond the
traditional adjudicatory model. n229 The late Abram Chayes aptly
characterized these proceedings as one \"which had widespread effects on
persons not before the court and required the judge\'s continuous
involvement in administration and implementation.\" n230 These domestic
affairs controversies are significantly different from those affecting
foreign affairs, however, because the non-party entities affected by
judicial decisions in the domestic context operate largely within the
same legal framework as the courts. On the other hand, in the foreign
affairs context, the affected entities lie outside the jurisdiction of
the domestic courts. Unlike in the domestic context, considerations of
power often weigh as heavily as legal factors in determining the norms
of inter-state behavior. n231 Therefore, there is greater risk that a
court\'s determination in a foreign affairs dispute could have an impact
on a wider range of actors outside the court\'s jurisdiction than it
would in a domestic dispute. The significance of the complex
interactions of political, security, and economic power at work in the
realm of international relations also underscores another reason why the
involvement of courts in foreign affairs might be detrimental to foreign
policy. This rationale involves the inherent \[\*995\] limitations of
the various remedial tools available to the courts when they confront
foreign affairs controversies. For instance, in many international
disputes or controversies, an approach that focuses on power-based
diplomacy and negotiation may be more advantageous to the states
involved than rule-based adjudications. n232 Even one of the leading
proponents of a rule-based approach in international affairs admits that
\"in practice the observable international institutions and legal
systems involve some mixture of both \[rule-based and power-based
diplomatic approaches\].\" n233 Given the continuous relevance of power
as a factor in international relations, the remedial devices available
to the courts - such as injunctions, writs, and declaratory relief - are
inadequate and often inapplicable to foreign affairs controversies. This
is because [[judicial remedies are often designed to addre]{.mark}ss the
concerns of [conventional adjudication]{.mark}]{.underline}, which as
Professor Fuller has explained, almost always involve \"claims of right
or accusation of faults.\" [n234 [In the international
system]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [iss[ues]{.mark} [cannot be neatly
broken down into legally cognizable]{.mark} wrong or right
[answers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such circumstances, [the affected
actors may prefer a more flexible and open-ended resolution of a problem
than would be achieved through a decision based on rules and
standards]{.underline}. Understandably, courts have occasionally invoked
this non-rule based aspect of international diplomacy to justify
abstaining from foreign affairs controversies. n235

Nonetheless, foreign relations remain special, and [[courts must treat
them differently in one important respect]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the
twenty-first century, [[speed matters]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the
[[executive branch alone possesses]{.mark} [the ability to articulate
and implement foreign policy]{.mark} quickly]{.underline}. Even
non-realists will acknowledge that the international realm is much more
susceptible to crisis and emergency than the domestic realm. But speed
remains more important even to non-crisis foreign affairs cases. ^n391^
[It is true that **the stable nature of American hegemony will prevent
truly destabilizing events**]{.underline} from happening without great
changes in the geopolitical situation - the sort that occur over
decades. The United States will not, for some time, face the same sorts
of existential threats as in the past. ^n392^ Nonetheless, [in foreign
affairs matters]{.underline}, [it is [only the executive branch that has
the capacity successfully to conduct]{.mark} \[\*150\] treaty
negotiations,]{.underline} for example, [which depend on adjusting
positions quickly]{.underline}. [The need for speed is particularly
acute in crises]{.underline}. [Threats from]{.underline} transnational
[terrorist groups and]{.underline} loose **[[nuclear weapons are among
the most serious problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** facing the United
States today. The United States maintains a \"quasi-monopoly on the
international use of force,\" ^n393^ but [the [rapid pace of change and
improvements in weapons technology mean that the executive branch must
respond to emergencies long before the courts have an opportunity to
weigh in]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even if a court was able to respond
quickly enough, it is not clear that we would want courts to adjudicate
foreign affairs crises without the deliberation and opportunities for
review that are essential aspects of their institutional competence.
Therefore, [[courts should grant a higher level of deference]{.mark} [to
executive branch determinations]{.mark} in deciding whether to grant a
temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction in foreign
affairs matters]{.underline}. Under the super-strong Curtiss-Wright
deference scheme, the court should accept the executive branch
interpretation unless Congress has specifically addressed the matter and
the issue does not fall within the President\'s textually-specified
Article I powers.

flexibility**

DEFERENCE TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH" lexis)

As Chevron recognized, n73 [the [executive]{.mark} branch
[possesses]{.mark} two institutional [characteristics that make it
superior to courts]{.mark}]{.underline} in the interpretations of
certain kinds of laws. First, [executive [agencies]{.mark} usually
[possess expertise]{.mark} in the administration of certain
statutes,]{.underline} particularly those in complex areas. Second,
[[the]{.mark} executive [branch is subject to greater political
accountability than the judiciary]{.mark}, and the electorate could
ultimately change unwanted interpretations]{.underline}. n74 As Justice
Stevens himself explained in Chevron, \"Judges are not experts in the
field, and are not part of either political branch of the Government.\"
n75 While agencies are not directly accountable to the people, the Chief
Executive is, and it is entirely appropriate for this political branch
of the Government to make such policy choices - resolving the competing
interests which Congress itself either inadvertently did not resolve, or
intentionally left to be resolved by the agency charged with the
administration of the statute in light of everyday realities.

\[\*202\] One way to think about the executive branch\'s comparative
advantage is in terms of the likelihood of errors. [Agencies which
possess greater expertise over a complex and technical statute are less
likely to depart from Congressional intent]{.underline} in their
interpretations of those statutes, especially ambiguous provisions in
those statutes. While agencies may well incur greater costs in making
those decisions, such costs reflect the likelihood that they will seek a
broader set of information about their legal interpretation than that
presented to courts. Indeed, [[unlike courts, the executive]{.mark}
branch [is designed to develop specialized competence. In]{.mark} the
area of [foreign policy, the executive]{.mark} branch [is composed of
large bureaucracies solely focused on designing and implementing foreign
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The more common criticism]{.mark} of the executive branch [is that it
is likely to manipulate]{.mark} its [expertise]{.mark} in the service of
political goals]{.underline}. While [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} may seem
like a criticism, it [[is actually a virtue in the context of resolving
ambiguities in laws implicating foreign affairs]{.mark}. Such laws
nearly always implicate broad policy decisions or political values and
the political nature of the executive branch gives it advantages in
making such decisions]{.underline}. If Congress leaves ambiguities in a
foreign affairs statute, for instance, it is reasonable to assume it
would prefer such ambiguities to be resolved by the more politically
responsive institution. Indeed, it is doubtful that there is substantial
popular support for transferring authority to the judiciary in cases
where the law relates to how to deal with a serious external threat. n76

disastrous decisionmaking**

the University of Chicago Law School AND \*\*professor at Harvard Law
School (Eric and Adrian, [Terror in the Balance: Security, Liberty, and

As against this view, we suggest that the standard Carolene Products
approach comes unglued during times of emergency. [[Judges]{.mark} face
a risk of committing errors]{.underline} in two directions: they may
erroneously validate policies that stem from democratic failure, or
[they [may erroneously invalidate measures necessary for]{.mark}
national [security]{.mark}]{.underline}. The risks and costs of the
first type of error are constant across both normal times and
emergencies, but in emergencies the risks and costs of the second type
of error spike upward. [[In times of emergency, the judges' information
is especially poor]{.mark}, their ability to sort justified from
unjustified policies especially limited, and the cost of erroneously
blocking necessary security measures may be disastrou]{.underline}s.
[[Included among those costs is the cost of delay, which amounts to a
temporary blockage]{.mark} of new policies and which is especially
serious during emergencies, where time is all.]{.underline} In general,
[the difference in the stakes between emergencies and normal times makes
the limited capacities of judges decisive]{.underline}. Historically,
the judges themselves have recognized this, remaining quiescent until
the emergency decays and passes by. [In times of emergency, [judicial
deference is both desirable and predictable, given the high stakes and
the judges' limited information and competence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Justice Field, of course, does wind up treating the political branch's
conclusions, in this particular setting, as conclusive on the judiciary
--- but he does not rest that outcome on the idea that immigration
control is a sovereign power outside the reach of the Constitution.
Instead, he offers a statement about institutional roles seen as
appropriate for the respective branches of government in this specific
domain. [In the foreign arena]{.underline}, he writes, [as a matter of
"self-preservation,"]{.underline}34 [the government has the]{.underline}
"highest [duty" to "preserve . . . independence, and]{.underline} give
[**security against foreign aggression** and
**encroachment**]{.underline}."35 To achieve these ends, [the government
is **clothed with authority** to determine the occasion on
which]{.underline} the [powers shall be called forth]{.underline}; and
its determinations, so far as the subjects affected are concerned, are
necessarily conclusive upon all its departments and officers. . . . [The
**existence of [war]{.mark}**]{.underline} would [[render the
necessity]{.underline}]{.mark} of the proceeding only [more obvious and
[pressing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The same necessity, in a less pressing
degree, may arise when war does not exist, and the same authority which
adjudges the necessity in one case must also determine it in the other.
In both cases its determination is conclusive upon the judiciary.36 In
other words, [in 1888, the political branches judged
necessary]{.underline} the application of [a new]{.underline} absolute
[rule excluding Chinese laborers]{.underline}, in order [to **achieve
security** against]{.underline} what Congress deemed a type of [foreign
encroachment]{.underline}.37 [Even with misgivings]{.underline} about
the justice or fairness of the action, [[the courts **will not
second-guess**]{.mark} that judgment]{.underline} of necessity.
[[In]{.mark} realms touching]{.underline} upon [**[foreign
relations]{.mark}** and]{.underline} potential **[national
self-preservation]{.underline}**, Field indicates, [[the nation must
**speak with one voice**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [it is not
for]{.underline} the [courts to introduce a discordant
sound]{.underline}. B. Complexity, Prophecy, and Experimentation in
Foreign Affairs Decisionmaking [Some critics]{.underline} of the plenary
power doctrine [question this]{.underline} asserted [**linkage** between
immigration and foreign affairs]{.underline}. Chinese exclusion was not
a foreign affairs decision, they assert, but one driven by domestic
political considerations --- and in fact it worsened our relations with
China.38 The invocation of foreign affairs is seen as a pretext covering
up uglier motives, and the plenary power doctrine prevents courts from
looking behind the mask.39 Therefore, [some assert that courts
should]{.underline} simply [provide]{.underline} the ordinary measure of
**[constitutional scrutiny]{.underline}** --- to smoke out invidious
motives or at least [to provide an appropriate evaluation
of]{.underline} the weight of [the governmental interest]{.underline} in
light of the individual stake.40 This kind of pre-textual invocation
certainly can occur. But [here is the difficulty: We should not
assume]{.underline} that [pretexts in]{.underline} the [foreign
affairs]{.underline} arena [are readily identifiable]{.underline}. As
Justice Breyer observed in a recent political question case:
[[Decisionmaking in]{.underline}]{.mark} \[the [[foreign
affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}\] area typically [[is]{.mark} highly
political]{.underline}. It is ["[**delicate**" and
"**complex**."]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[[rests upon information]{.underline}]{.mark} readily [[available to the
Executive]{.underline}]{.mark} Branch [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
[intelligence committees]{.underline} of [[Congress]{.underline}, [but
**not**]{.underline}]{.mark} readily **[available to [the
courts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It frequently is highly dependent upon
what Justice Jackson called "prophecy." And [the creation of wise
[foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline} typically [[lies]{.mark} well
**[beyond]{.mark}**]{.underline} the experience or professional capacity
of **[[a judge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At the same time, [where foreign
affairs is at issue, the]{.underline} practical [need for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to speak "with one voice and
ac\[t\] as one," is]{.underline} particularly [important]{.underline}.41
Many of [the nation's policy]{.underline} tools [in [the foreign
arena]{.mark} are crude and imprecise, with uncertain impact.
This]{.underline} very [uncertainty may [require
**trial-and-error**]{.mark}]{.underline} application, [[with]{.mark} a
need for **[quick]{.mark}**]{.underline} policy
**[[changes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially **[[in times of
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Therefore, [**[deference]{.mark}** to the
political branches [is called for]{.mark}]{.underline}, not because we
can always be sure that their motives are pure and nondiscriminatory ---
we cannot --- but [because [subjecting these]{.mark}]{.underline}
measures [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} detailed [[litigation would
**interfere with**]{.mark} **the [flexibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}
often [necessary to act beyond our borders]{.underline}. A too-ready
[[judicial interference would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[**impair our
ability** to deploy]{.underline}]{.mark} uncertain [[tools ---]{.mark}
deriving from **immigration**]{.underline} control, [trade regulation,
or]{.underline} other [components of]{.underline} our [international
relations --- [according to a single]{.mark}]{.underline} unified
[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}.42 C. An Example: The Contrast to
Domestic Measures [Consider the **seizure of U.S.
diplomats**]{.underline} by militants [[in Tehran]{.mark} in
1978]{.underline}. After the embassy invasion was ratified and defended
by the new Iranian government, [[the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}
government [[turned to]{.mark} a disparate variety of countermeasures
to]{.underline} try to [win release]{.underline} of the American
hostages, [including the [seizure of]{.mark} billions]{.underline} of
dollars [in [assets]{.mark} of Iran]{.underline} and of its companies
and nationals, litigation in [the International Court of Justice,
a]{.underline}n ill-fated [military rescue attempt]{.underline} after
Iran defied the International Court, [[diplomatic
overtures]{.underline}]{.mark} through Algeria,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} certain [[immigration]{.mark}-law-based
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline} imposed on Iranian nationals in the
United States.43 There were even proposals at the time to use
immigration or other powers to intern large numbers of Iranian nationals
so they could perhaps be part of an exchange that would bring the
diplomats home.44 Thankfully, such internment was never put into motion.
[Contrast]{.underline} the trial-and-error use of [these]{.underline}
generally **[crude and scattershot measures]{.underline}** [with how the
government would respond to a domestic]{.underline} kidnapping and
potential [hostage situation]{.underline}. The police could deploy
quickly to investigate who seized the victims and where they were
currently located. In that process the authorities could use judicial
search warrants to facilitate the inquiry, plus arrest warrants and
compulsory grand jury subpoenas as appropriate. They could call on a
wide range of assistance and technical support from a host of fully
empowered domestic agencies, state and federal. Once the kidnappers were
located, the police would establish perimeter control around the hostage
site. [No hostile militias would stand in the way]{.underline} (or if
such appeared, other governmental power, including the National Guard,
could be deployed). [In a]{.underline} protracted [standoff, judicially
issued search warrants might help legitimate a]{.underline} forcible
[rescue operation]{.underline}. And [the full weight of]{.underline}
criminal [punishment]{.underline}, imposed [through]{.underline}
efficiently functioning [courts, could be expected]{.underline} for the
kidnappers or hostage takers. [This]{.underline} comparison [helps
reveal why courts are positioned to apply close]{.underline}
constitutional **[scrutiny of]{.underline}** official **[domestic
action]{.underline}**, whenever it is credibly challenged,
[but]{.underline} properly [feel]{.underline} more **[constrained [in
the international arena]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the international
arena, U.S. actors generally cannot invoke compulsory process or other
reliable coercive means under their own government's control. Moreover,
[[the **stakes are**]{.underline}]{.mark} typically
[[**higher**,]{.mark} as is the number]{.underline} of people
[potentially affected]{.underline} --- not only by the immediate outcome
but also by downstream effects, as the resolution either deters similar
adverse actions in the future or instead stimulates them because the
U.S. effort failed. [With a domestic operation, judges can be
confident]{.underline} that [the government will]{.underline} still
[have plenty of capacity to deal with]{.underline} public safety
[threats, even in the presence of]{.underline} robust [judicial review.
One cannot have such confidence]{.underline} [about]{.underline} the
efficacy of alternative policy tools in [the **global arena**
if]{.underline} domestic [judicial action begins to]{.underline} prevent
or **[second-guess or slow down]{.underline}** the use of those
initially chosen by [the political branches]{.underline}. Another
difference between the two settings is relevant. In [the domestic arena,
we do not tolerate]{.underline} individuals using **[tit-for-tat
responses]{.underline}** to remedy wrongful behavior. I cannot justify
seizing and carrying away my neighbor's television on the ground that he
borrowed my riding mower months ago and never returned it. But this
prohibition on messy self-help obtains precisely because efficient
hierarchical legal mechanisms, involving professional police and a
developed court system, stand available to redress my neighbor's
wrongful act. In recent decades, the world has taken limited but hopeful
steps toward investing transnational institutions with comparable
powers, but progress remains quite uneven across different policy
domains. [[The plenary power doctrine **manifests**]{.mark}
**the**]{.underline} Supreme [**Court's [judgment]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} the]{.underline} kind of [detailed constitutional
[scrutiny]{.mark} appropriate for the]{.underline} mature and developed
[domestic public order [is **not workable in the**]{.mark}]{.underline}
more primitive [**[international]{.mark} legal [system]{.mark}**,
marked]{.underline} primarily [by]{.underline} horizontal
[action-and-response to]{.underline} try to [rectify
breaches]{.underline}. D. The Nongovernmental Component of Foreign
Affairs Decisionmaking [Foreign affairs are involved in **immigration
decisionmaking** for another]{.underline}, more [entangling
reason]{.underline}, even when there is no clear effort to retaliate
against or to influence a foreign government. Most [high-level
immigration decisions]{.underline} --- by Congress or by the executive
branch --- [are designed]{.underline}, at least in part, [to **influence
or shape behavior overseas**]{.underline} by individuals and nonstate
actors, including both prospective immigrants (contemplating either
legal or illegal channels) and smuggling organizations. For example, the
decision (part of Operation Streamline45) to prosecute a high percentage
of simple entrants without inspection caught along the southern border,
causing them to spend some time in jail or prison before being
repatriated, has been criticized as disproportionate to the inherent
nature of this misdemeanor offense.46 But this critique misunderstands
the policy decision. [Operation Streamline is]{.underline} primarily
[meant to send a **deterrent**]{.underline} message [to others
contemplating a]{.underline} future [clandestine
crossing]{.underline}.47 The same is true of decisions to repatriate
violators to a distant part of the land border rather than back to the
border town from which they entered and where their coyote may be
waiting to help them try again to enter.48 To take another example, [in
1994, the Clinton administration decided to decouple]{.underline} the
grant of [work authorization from]{.underline} the simple act of [filing
for asylum]{.underline}, as had been provided under earlier regulations,
[though this]{.underline} change [would mean that]{.underline} many
[applicants would be without]{.underline} a means of
[support]{.underline}, other than private or family charity,
[for]{.underline} as long as [180 days. This]{.underline} austere step
[was taken]{.underline}, in significant part, [to **discourage people**
planning to come to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
file an ill-founded claim that]{.underline} previously [would have
secured]{.underline} several [years of residence and lawful
work]{.underline} while they awaited a hearing.49 Changes to the
treatment or opportunities of noncitizens in the United States, whether
in the direction of restriction or liberalization, almost inevitably
affect the decisions of people and organizations abroad who are thinking
about organizing or participating in migration to the United States.
Smuggling organizations, in fact, often build their business plans
around finding and exploiting weak spots in immigration laws or
processes.50 As a result, [some]{.underline} U.S. government [measures
take on a more **severe or restrictive aspect** than]{.underline}
[might]{.underline} [initially]{.underline} seem to [be warranted by
the]{.underline} acts of the [individuals most immediately
affected]{.underline}. This is because the policymakers mean the action
not just for those who are the direct object of enforcement on U.S. soil
but also for the message sent to others they want to deter. [This
dynamic appears to explain]{.underline}, in significant part, [the Obama
administration's decisions to respond to the]{.underline} southwest
[border migration surge]{.underline} in summer of 2014 [with
a]{.underline} surprisingly **[severe set of measures]{.underline}**,
including sustained detention, even though the subjects were mainly
children traveling with a mother or other relative. [The
executive]{.underline} branch [also implemented accelerated removal
processing]{.underline} where the law permitted such action, and assured
substantial publicity for the flight whenever recent migrants were
deported by airplane to their home country.51 Despite sharp criticism,
[these practices]{.underline} persisted, and they [seem to have
had]{.underline} much of [the **desired deterrent impact** in
the]{.underline} foreign [nations at issue]{.underline}. In fact,
monthly arrivals of unaccompanied minors from these countries declined
from 10,631 in June 2014 to 2,432 in September.52 [This]{.underline}
kind of [deterrence-based action]{.underline}, focused on overseas
individuals and nongovernmental players, [is]{.underline} also [an
**aspect of foreign affairs**]{.underline}, even though it falls below
the plane of high-level geopolitics. [It]{.underline} likewise [may need
to take the form of]{.underline} rough-hewn [trial-and-error,
like]{.underline} the more [traditional foreign-relations
actions]{.underline} directed at governments. [The]{.underline} Supreme
[Court's case law]{.underline} over the years [appears to consider such
policy]{.underline} choices **[equally worthy of foreign-affairs
deference]{.underline}**.53 [This]{.underline} analysis [is not meant as
advocacy for]{.underline} the quick or expansive use of [immigration
restrictions to respond to objectionable]{.underline} or unwelcome
[actions]{.underline} of foreign governments or nonstate actors. For
reasons of both policy and proportion, immigration sanctions of this
type should be sparingly deployed. [But the Court's **doctrine of
deference**]{.underline} in Chae Chan Ping and later cases [is based on
the recognition that even for]{.underline} relatively [liberal
foreign-affairs decisionmakers, **rough-hewn actions** that]{.underline}
initially [seem outsized]{.underline} or individually unfair [might need
to be in the mix to **respond to**]{.underline}, or to help shape,
**[actions]{.underline}** that others are taking
**[abroad]{.underline}**.54 III. Why the Court Resists Even Moderate
Proposals for a More Active Judicial Role [A]{.underline} more nuanced
[branch of]{.underline} the Chae Chan Ping [criticism accepts that
foreign affairs considerations may]{.underline} well [be at stake
in]{.underline} some [immigration decisions, but would **modify the
doctrine** to allow for a]{.underline} carefully structured **[closer
judicial look]{.underline}**.55 [The courts]{.underline}, such observers
contend, should not take political branch assertions as controlling, but
instead [should perform an initial judicial probe]{.underline} of the
asserted reasons, [to decide whether the]{.underline} challenged
[immigration restriction rests on]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
significant [foreign affairs foundation]{.underline}. If the answer is
yes, then the reviewing court should treat the political branches'
decision as dispositive --- essentially, as a political question not
subject to judicial review. But if not, then the court should apply
ordinary modes of constitutional review, which might well bring a form
of heightened scrutiny. At first glance, this kind of proposal would
seem to offer an attractive middle ground to the Supreme Court. Yet [the
Court]{.underline} in practice [has **manifested great resistance** to
these]{.underline} scholarly [invitations]{.underline}. Why? In my view,
a majority of the [[Justices harbor]{.underline}]{.mark} a [deep
**[skepticism that lower courts can]{.mark} be trusted** to [give
sufficient weight to foreign policy]{.mark} concerns in making any
such]{.underline} threshold [assessment. The]{.underline} very [nature
of immigration litigation]{.underline} in the courts of appeals, with an
actual and often sympathetic human being front and center, [makes
a]{.underline} reviewing [judge]{.underline} far more [likely to
overvalue the]{.underline} individual [interests at stake and undervalue
the]{.underline} more subtle and complex [reasons why a]{.underline}
particular [measure may be **needed for**]{.underline} system
[**stability** or to **influence**]{.underline} behavior [**beyond our
borders** --- connections that]{.underline} often [would not
become]{.underline} fully [apparent until]{.underline} broader damage is
manifested [months or years after an interventionist judicial
decision]{.underline}.56 Anna Law's book, The Immigration Battle in
American Courts, documents this disparity in outlook between the Supreme
Court and the lower courts quite revealingly. She describes "how \[lower
court\] judges can disregard congressional edicts limiting their scope
of review in order to reach a desired result,"57 and can usually get
away with it because the Supreme Court can review only a tiny fraction
of their decisions.58 Professor Law regards this stance by the courts of
appeals as a virtue, but the Supreme Court doubtless views it otherwise.
[[Keeping the]{.mark} plenary power [doctrine **categorical**
gives]{.mark} the]{.underline} Supreme [Court greater [assurance that
lower courts will **preserve**]{.mark} **the space** needed for
government actions to meet]{.underline} real **[[foreign affairs
imperatives]{.underline}]{.mark}** (even if this stance inevitably also
leaves room for some ill-motivated actions adopted by the political
branches). If this symposium were being held at the time of Chae Chan
Ping's centennial, in 1989, we might have had greater reason to expect
some softening by the Supreme Court regarding the deference doctrine in
the foreign affairs arena. Exactly twenty-five years before the week
when this symposium convened in Norman, Oklahoma, the Berlin Wall fell,
signaling that the Soviet bloc was coming apart, about to be replaced,
in many instances, by democratic governments. Lengthy wars were ending
in Latin America, and dictators were being forced from office. [It
appeared we were on the cusp of a]{.underline} far more [**benign world
order** --- one that might permit]{.underline} the rapid flowering of
more [protective international legal institutions and]{.underline}
thereby [reduce reliance on **crude action-and-response**]{.underline}
in the international arena. **[[Today's global scene
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** far more [**[grim]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Not
only has [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[experienced]{.underline} the trauma of [al Qaeda's September 11

immigration screening, but [democratic [nations are]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [[facing]{.underline}]{.mark} new [**global threats**
from]{.underline} other [**[nongovernmental actors]{.mark}**
who]{.underline} actually [glorify]{.underline} the use of [beheadings,
crucifixion, and slavery, in addition to]{.underline} other players
using more old-fashioned forms of [**[terrorism]{.mark}** directed at
civilians. **[Failed states]{.mark}** are]{.underline} more
[common]{.underline}, and [well-armed [insurgencies have
**proliferated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The march of [[**democracy** has
slowed]{.mark} and]{.underline}, in several countries, [reversed.

While courts are the primary institutions in the U.S. system for
interpreting and applying laws, some of their key institutional
characteristics undercut their ability in the foreign affairs law
context. In particular, [courts have access to limited information in
foreign affairs cases and are unable to take into account the broader
factual context underlying the application of laws in such
areas]{.underline}.

These limitations are not a failing. They are part of the inherent
design of the federal court system, which is intended to be independent
from politics, to allow parties to drive litigation in particular cases,
and to receive information in highly formal and limited ways. While
these characteristics are helpful for the purposes of neutral
decisionmaking, they also may render courts less effective tools in
resolving ambiguities in laws designed to achieve national goals in
international relations.

[Courts do not actively gather information]{.underline} about a
particular case or a particular law. Rather, that information is
provided to them by the contending parties, in many cases through the
expensive process of discovery. [Any information provided to the court
for evidentiary purposes must survive rules that impose tests for
relevance, credibility, and reliability that are designed to ensure
fairness toward the contending parties.]{.underline} In the criminal
\[\*200\] context, such information is further limited to prevent
violating a defendant\'s constitutional rights.

[By contrast, the executive branch itself collects a wide variety of
information through its own institutional experts and a wide global
network of contacts without the necessity of strict rules of evidentiary
exclusion]{.underline}. While this information may be presented to the
executive branch at any time, a court generally cannot account for new
information except in the context of a new case. n71 [Courts also cannot
update statutory mandates to reflect new information, but instead must
continue to enforce policies even when they are no longer
appropriate.]{.underline} For instance, once the political branches have
enacted a statute or approved a treaty, the courts cannot alter or
refuse to execute those laws, even if the original circumstances that
gave rise to the statute or treaty have changed or even if the national
interest would be harmed. n72

Aside from the judiciary\'s information-gathering limitations, [there
are strong reasons to doubt the ability of the members of the federal
judiciary to resolve effectively foreign affairs laws ambiguities.
Judges are not chosen based on their expertise]{.underline} in a
particular field. Federal judges, with a few minor exceptions, handle a
wide variety of cases without any subject matter specialties. None, for
instance, is chosen because of his or her expertise on matters relating
to foreign affairs or foreign affairs laws.

comparatively [more]{.underline} likely to do so**

[None of this analysis, it bears repeating, suggests that the executive
cannot make mistakes]{.underline} or poor judgments in the
interpretations of laws relating to foreign affairs. [The question is
whether it will make more mistakes or poorer judgments and whether it is
less costly to correct its mistakes]{.underline}. [Both institutions can
make mistakes, but our analysis suggests courts are more likely to make
mistakes and that the costs of reversing those mistakes will be

[[The idea that Congress will]{.underline}]{.mark}, on net, [[weed out
bad policies rests on an institutional comparison]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The president is elected by a national constituency on a winner-take-all
basis (barring the remote chance that the Electoral College will
matter), whereas Congress is a summation of local constituencies and
thus affords more voice to political and racial minorities. At the level
of political psychology, [decisionmaking within the executive is prone
to]{.underline} group polarization and other forms of [groupthink or
irrational panic]{.underline},51 [whereas the internal diversity of
legislative deliberation checks these forces]{.underline}. At the level
of political structure, Congress contains internal veto gates and
chokepoints---consider the committee system and the fi libuster
rule---that provide minorities an opportunity to block harmful policies,
whereas executive decisionmaking is relatively centralized and unitary.

[The contrast is drawn too sharply, because [in practice **the executive
is a they, not an it**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Presidential
oversight is incapable of fully unifying executive branch policies,
which means that **[[disagreement flourishes]{.mark} within the
executive as well, [dampening panic and
groupthink]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and providing minorities with
political redoubts]{.underline}.52 Where a national majority is
internally divided, [the structure of presidential politics creates
chokepoints that can give racial or ideological minorities
disproportionate influence, [just as the legislative process]{.mark}
does]{.underline}. Consider the influence of Arab Americans in Michigan,
often a swing state in presidential elections.

[It is not obvious]{.underline}, then, [that statutory authorization
**makes any difference at all**]{.underline}. One possibility is that a
large national majority dominates both Congress and the presidency and
enacts panicky policies, oppresses minorities, or increases security in
ways that have ratchet effects that are costly to reverse. If this is
the case, a requirement of statutory authorization does not help.
Another possibility is that there are internal institutional checks,
within both the executive branch and Congress, on the adoption of
panicky or oppressive policies and that democratic minorities have real
infl uence in both arenas. If this is the case, then a requirement of
authorization is not necessary and does no good. Authorization only
makes a difference in the unlikely case where the executive is
thoroughly panicky, or oppressively majoritarian, while Congress resists
the stampede toward bad policies and safeguards the interests of
oppressed minorities.

Even if that condition obtains, however, the argument for authorization
goes wrong by failing to consider both sides of the normative ledger. As
for majoritarian oppression, the multiplicity of veto gates within
Congress may allow minorities to block harmful discrimination, but it
also allows minorities to block policies and laws which, although
targeted, are nonetheless good. As for panic and irrationality, [[if
Congress is more deliberative,]{.mark} one result will be to prevent
groupthink and slow down stampedes toward bad policies, but
[a]{.mark}nother [result will be to delay necessary]{.mark} emergency
[measures and **slow down stampedes toward good
policies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Proponents]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the authorization requirement sometimes [[assume
that]{.underline}]{.mark} quick action, even [[panicky action,
**always** produces bad policies. But]{.mark} there is no necessary
connection between these two things; [expedited action is sometimes
good, and panicky crowds can stampede either]{.mark} in the wrong
direction or in the right [direction]{.mark}. Slowing down the adoption
of new policies through congressional [oversight retards]{.mark} the
adoption [not only]{.mark} of [bad policies, but also]{.mark} of [good
policies]{.mark} that need to be adopted quickly if they are to be
effective]{.underline}.

**4\-\--No groupthink- studies**

Anthony **[Hempell 4]{.underline}** \[User Experience Consulting Senior
Information Architect, "Groupthink: An introduction to Janis\' theory of
concurrence-seeking tendencies in group work.,
http://www.anthonyhempell.com/papers/groupthink/, March 3\]

[In the thirty years since Janis first proposed the groupthink
model,]{.underline} **[there is still little agreement as to the
validity of the model in assessing decision-making
behaviour]{.underline}** (Park, 2000). **[[Janis\'
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}** is often criticized because it **[[does
not present a framework that is suitable for empirical
testing]{.underline}]{.mark}**; instead, the evidence for groupthink
comes from largely qualitative, historical or archival methods
(Sunstein, 2003). Some critics go so far as to say that **[Janis\'s
[work relies on \"anecdote, casual observation, and intuitive appeal
rather than rigorous research]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" (Esser, 1998,
cited in Sunstein, 2003, p.142). [While some studies have shown support
for the groupthink model,]{.underline} the **[support tends to be mixed
or conditional]{.underline}** (Esser, 1998); some studies have revealed
that a closed leadership style and external threats (in particular, time
pressure) promote groupthink and defective decision making (Neck &
Moorhead, 1995, cited by Choi & Kim, 1999); **[the effect of group
cohesiveness is still inconclusive]{.underline}** (Mullen, Anthony,
Salas & Driskel, 1994, cited by Choi & Kim, 1999). [[Janis\'s]{.mark}
model tends to be supported by [studies]{.mark} that [employ a
qualitative case-study]{.mark}]{.underline} [[approach **as opposed to
experimental research**]{.mark}**, which tends to either partially
support or not support Janis\'s thesis**]{.underline} (Park, 2000). The
lack of success in experimental validation of groupthink may be due to
difficulties in operationalizing and conceptualizing it as a testable
variable (Hogg & Hains, 1998; Park, 2000). Some **[researchers have
criticized Janis for categorically denouncing groupthink as a negative
phenomenon]{.underline}** (Longley & Pruitt, 1980, cited in Choi & Kim,
1999). Sniezek (1992) argues that **[[there are instances where
concurrence-seeking may promote group
performance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When used to explain behaviour in a
practical setting, **[groupthink has been frames as a detrimental group
process; the result of this has been that many corporate training
programs have created strategies for avoiding groupthink in the
workplace]{.underline}** (Quinn, Faerman, Thompson & McGrath, 1990,
cited in Choi & Kim, 1999). Another criticism of groupthink is that
Janis overestimates the link between the decision-making process and the
outcome (McCauley, 1989; Tetlock, Peterson, McGuire, Chang & Feld, 1992;
cited in Choi & Kim, 1999). [Tetlock et al argue that there are many
other factors between the decision process and the outcome. [The outcome
of any decision-making process]{.mark}]{.underline}, they argue, [[will
only have a certain probability of success due to]{.mark} various
[environmental factors]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as luck). A
large-scale study researching decision-making in seven major American
corporations concluded that [decision-making worked best when following
a sound information processing method]{.underline}; however these groups
also showed signs of groupthink, in that they had strong leadership
which attempted to persuade others in the group that they were right
(Peterson et al, 1998, cited in Sunstein, 2003). Esser (1998) found that
groupthink characteristics were correlated with failures; however
[cohesiveness did not appear to be a factor:]{.underline} groups
consisting of strangers, friends, or various levels of previous
experience together did not appear to effect decision-making ability.
[Janis\' claims of insulation of groups and groups led by autocratic
leaders did show that these attributes were indicative of groupthink
symptoms. [Moorhead & Montanari conducted a study]{.mark} where [they
concluded]{.mark} that [groupthink]{.mark} symptoms [had no]{.mark}
significant [effect on group performance]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that
\"the relationship between groupthink-induced decision defects and
outcomes were not as strong as Janis suggests\" (Moorhead & Montanari,
1986, p. 399; cited by Choi & Kim, 1999). [Overall, the
[groupthink]{.mark} hypothesis appears to be valuable as a
descriptive,]{.underline} analytic and heuristic tool (Esser, 1998)
[**but [is not a good model for empirical testing]{.mark};** it attempts
to explain a complex phenomenon but is **difficult to operationalize
into testable variables**]{.underline}. While some areas of Janis\'
theory have been supported by empirical or experimental, others remain
ambiguous or even contradictory (Sunstein, 2003). When reading the
assessments of others, [it begs the question of whether groupthink is
suited to being used as a model for empirical analysis:]{.underline} is
it fair to measure groupthink theory on the basis of laboratory tests,
when in real life groupthink occurs within a complex and volatile
environment? Janis\'s original method was one of inductive reasoning
from archival records and case studies; perhaps it is better left as a
qualitative model that can help illuminate the inexact spheres of
organizational behaviour and communications theory.

it more likely**

\"Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\'s views on executive power may
stir controversy\", USA TODAY,
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/12/supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-fan-presidential-powers/776292002/

WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh argued in 1998 that
President Bill Clinton could be impeached for lying about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky. For much of the next decade he worked inside the
White House for President George W. Bush, where he came to the
conclusion that \"the job of president is far more difficult than any
other civilian position in government.\" Thus it was that in 2009, after
Barack Obama won the presidency, he suggested that presidents should be
immune from criminal investigations and prosecutions, as well as
personal civil suits, until after leaving office. \"I believe it vital
that the president be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as
few distractions as possible,\" he wrote. [[Kavanaugh\'s]{.mark}
evolving [views on executive power]{.mark}]{.underline} through the past
three presidencies **[[are]{.mark} [supported by mainstream
conservatives]{.mark}]{.underline}** today. But they are viewed with
suspicion by some who believe the presidency has grown more powerful
than the framers of the Constitution intended. And Democrats are
concerned that President Donald Trump\'s nomination of Kavanaugh for the
Supreme Court is a reward for his espousal of presidential powers.
Should he win confirmation, some of them say, he should recuse himself
from cases involving Trump. \"The president of the United States should
not be above the law. The president of the United States should not be
beyond a criminal investigation,\" said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. \"The
president of the United States should not be able to pick the judge that
will preside over questions involving his investigation.\" While Senate
Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said the focus of his party\'s
effort to defeat Kavanaugh will be the judge\'s views on abortion and
health care, his position on executive power is quickly emerging as a
third front in the confirmation war. More: Will Brett Kavanaugh deliver
the change conservatives crave? More: Brett Kavanaugh is President
Trump\'s nominee for the Supreme Court More: For Trump, nomination may
hinge on Kavanaugh\'s risks and rewards Like many conservatives,
including most of those on the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh objects to one
form of executive branch power: that exercised by federal regulators
and, in particular, independent agencies. He is wary of green-lighting
most agency rules under a 1984 Supreme Court decision, a process that
has come to be known as \"Chevron deference.\" Just this year, Kavanaugh
dissented from a U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit ruling that upheld the structure of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, an independent agency created by Congress in 2010 in
the wake of the financial crisis on Wall Street. He called such agencies
\"a headless fourth branch of the U.S. Government\" that \"hold enormous
power over the economic and social life of the United States.\"
[Protecting the president]{.underline} For a primary author of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr\'s occasionally explicit report
detailing Clinton\'s transgressions, Kavanaugh traveled a long way to
his 2009 article in the Minnesota Law Review recommending that
presidents be free from prosecution. \"This is not something I
necessarily thought in the 1980s or 1990s,\" he wrote. But \"looking
back to the late 1990s, for example, the nation certainly would have
been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin
Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case
and its criminal-investigation offshoots.\" [Kavanaugh]{.underline} did
not [suggest]{.underline} that judges treat presidents differently,
however. He said Congress should pass a law providing that civil suits
and criminal investigations be deferred while the president is in
office. If the president acts \"dastardly,\" he said, \"the impeachment
process is available.\" The law review article -- which also included
recommendations for making agencies more accountable to the president
and, interestingly, streamlining the judicial confirmation process -- is
certain to be a focus when Kavanaugh goes before the Senate Judiciary
Committee later this summer or fall. Former Attorney General Alberto
Gonzales, who supervised Kavanaugh in the White House counsel\'s office,
said the nominee is \"probably right\" that a sitting president should
be immune from indictment and prosecution while in office. \"If
appointed and this issue were to come before the court, I think it
likely Brett would recuse on this issue,\" Gonzales said. [\'Enormous
concentration of power\' In hundreds of opinions and dissents at the
powerful appeals court, [Kavanaugh]{.mark}]{.underline} **[has
[backed]{.mark} the [president\'s national security powers]{.mark} and
has defended the use of military tribunals]{.underline}** for terrorism
suspects. "[Especially on national-security-related areas, [he is likely
to be]{.mark} with the more [pro-executive power]{.mark} folks on the
current court]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} Jonathan [Adler, an
expert on administrative law at Case Western Reserve University School
of Law. That would not represent much of a change at the high court,
where [conservative justices **usually**]{.mark} **[support]{.mark} the
[president on matters involving national security]{.mark}**.

**WSJ 10**, citing DOJ senior ethicist and Associate Deputy Attorney
David Margolis, "Vindicating John Yoo",
https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704757904575078182303405948

So [[after **five years of investigation**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[**partisan accusations** and **unethical media leaks**]{.underline},
[[the]{.mark} [Justice Department\'s **senior
ethicist**]{.mark}]{.underline} [has [concluded]{.mark} that Bush
Administration lawyers John [Yoo]{.mark} and Jay Bybee [committed **no
professional misconduct**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The issue now is whether
the proteges of Attorney General Eric Holder who led this exercise at
Justice\'s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) should themselves
be in the dock. That\'s our reading of the analysis by Associate Deputy
Attorney General David Margolis, a career official who reviewed both the
Bush-era legal memos on interrogating terror suspects and their review
by the lawyers at OPR. Remarkably, [his report is far more scathing
about OPR than it is about]{.underline} Messrs.
[[Yoo]{.underline}]{.mark} and Bybee, [who he says [made legal
errors]{.mark} but did so [in good faith]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[out of
honest legal analysis,]{.mark} and in the ethical service of their
clients in the executive branch]{.underline} at a time of war. Mr.
Margolis\'s review overrules both a draft OPR report whose contents were
leaked to the media last year and a final OPR report that was released
along with the Margolis review late Friday. Those OPR reports
recommended disciplinary action and potential disbarment for Messrs.
Bybee and Yoo for their advice while working in the Office of Legal
Counsel in the frantic months after September 11. [The [leaks
were]{.mark} themselves an [**unethical attempt** to smear]{.mark} the
[reputations of]{.mark} the [lawyers]{.mark} while they were under a gag
order and unable to reply.]{.underline} House Judiciary Chairman John
Conyers nonetheless leapt to praise Friday\'s release of earlier drafts,
touting them as evidence that the OLC memos were \"legally flawed and
fundamentally unsound.\" Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy promptly
called for Judge Bybee to resign from the federal bench. Both Democrats
have scheduled more grandstanding, er, hearings, for the coming days.
Justice is defending its pre-weekend document dump by saying that it had
to release the entire record. But notably, Justice failed to release a
14-page January 19, 2009 letter from then-Attorney General Michael
Mukasey and Deputy AG Mark Filip that eviscerated the first OPR draft.
The Mukasey-Filip memo has since appeared on media Web sites, and its
withering analysis clearly made an impression on Mr. Margolis. The
selective disclosure by Mr. Holder suggests the political nature of this
entire exercise. \-\-- Readers can review the documents for themselves,
but two OPR judgments deserve particular scorn. The first is the claim
that Messrs. Yoo and Bybee were so close to their client, i.e., the
White House, that they knew what the President and CIA wanted to hear.
But it is perfectly appropriate for a lawyer to know what his client
wants, and, by OPR\'s standard, 99% of professional lawyers could be
considered guilty of misconduct. The ethicists at OPR also claim the
Bush attorneys were wrong to stick to a legal analysis of interrogation
practices and should have also considered their moral and policy
implications. But [[the duty of the O]{.mark}ffice of [L]{.mark}egal
[C]{.mark}ounsel [is]{.mark} precisely [to offer]{.mark} [legal
advice]{.mark}, [not]{.mark} to [render]{.mark} [policy
judgments]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Interrogation policy was determined by
the **CIA and the White House**, as it should have been]{.underline}.
The last thing the country needs is for lawyers to tell the CIA how to
get actionable intelligence from enemy combatants. What\'s more, as Mr.
Mukasey\'s memo makes clear, the legal canons of Washington, D.C. and
many states expressly prohibit lawyers from offering such policy advice
to sophisticated clients such as the U.S. government. This is precisely
so lawyers don\'t muddy their legal counsel with policy bias. The rotten
quality of the OPR efforts \-- and Mr. Margolis\'s repudiation of them
\-- raises real questions about the lawyers who produced this work. H.
Marshall Jarrett, who supervised the first OPR draft, is a protege of
Mr. Holder who managed not to produce his draft report until the Bush
Administration was preparing to leave office. After Mr. Mukasey
\"memorialized\" his concerns, as his letter put it, the Jarrett draft
was leaked without the Mukasey response. Mr. Holder reassigned Mr.
Jarrett in April 2009 to lead the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys,
an arguably more powerful post. His OPR effort makes him unfit for such
a job. Mr. Holder replaced Mr. Jarrett at OPR with Mary Patrice Brown,
who tried to salvage OPR\'s original conclusions with a new but equally
deficient argument. After abandoning OPR\'s earlier specific allegations
that Messrs. Yoo and Bybee had violated D.C. Rule of Professional
Conduct 1.1 to provide competent representation and rule 2.1 to exercise
independent legal judgment, Mr. Margolis writes, Ms. Brown\'s final
report \"did not specify the rule or rules of professional conduct that
were violated.\" Instead, she added consideration of a \"best
practices\" memo and guiding principles. Mr. Margolis writes that these
documents raise several concerns, not least that \"neither of them
existed at the time Yoo and Bybee worked at OLC.\" Ms. Brown is
reportedly in line for a judicial nomination, and Republicans ought to
keep her embarrassing performance in mind when they vote on
confirmation. \-\-- Mr. Margolis deserves credit for his independent
analysis, but we also can\'t help but notice the striking change of tone
in the last few pages of his report. [Mr. Margolis\'s only duty was
determining whether the Bush attorneys had adhered to proper ethical
standards]{.underline}. **[On that question, he is unequivocal in saying
they did.]{.underline}** However, at the end of his 68-page review he
indulges in some superfluous commentary that Messrs. Yoo and Bybee
exhibited \"poor judgment\" and that some of their legal analysis was
mistaken. This is a matter of opinion \-- akin to writing an op-ed piece
\-- unrelated to the question of whether they behaved unethically, and
it is precisely the kind of judgment that Mr. Margolis says earlier in
the report that he will not render. His change of tone is notable enough
that it raises a question of whether Mr. Margolis decided to add this
concluding rhetoric as a way to propitiate Mr. Holder and to save at
least some face for the AG\'s proteges. Republicans should ask Mr.
Margolis about this if Democrats proceed with their hearings. [[The
larger story]{.mark} here [is the **vindication of**]{.mark} **Mr.
[Yoo]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and the other Bush attorneys, [who]{.mark}
[were **pilloried unfairly**]{.mark} **[over
ethics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in what was really a **policy
dispute**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the war on terror]{.underline}.
[[Democrats wanted to appease the anti-antiterror left]{.underline},
[and they fixed on **punishing mid-level
officials**]{.underline}]{.mark} as prominent enough to get public
at:tention but not so prominent as to seem like a banana republic
seeking revenge against a former President or Vice President. **[[Their
campaign has now been exposed as a partisan, and unethical,
smear.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**Their indicts amount to naked partisanship**

**Eastman, 9** - dean at Chapman University School of Law and a
professor of constitutional law (John, "His views spark important
debate" Los Angeles Times, 4/9,
<http://www.latimes.com/la-oe-eastman9-2009apr09,0,2922332.story>)

[As the dean of the law school]{.underline}, I welcome his presence and
the debate it has provoked. The opportunity to confront positions with
which one disagrees is the hallmark of a first-rate education. As a
constitutional law scholar, [I should]{.underline} also [note my
disagreement with Yoo\'s detractors.]{.underline} In my view, [the legal
positions Yoo advanced in the post-9/11 memos are supported]{.underline}
\-- some well supported; others at least arguable \-- [by constitutional
text, historical understanding and legal precedent]{.underline}. In
fact, [many of those positions were shared by Clinton administration
officials now serving in the Obama administration]{.underline}. For
example, one memo argued that the Geneva Convention does not apply to
unlawful combatants, such as members of Al Qaeda, who target civilian
populations and otherwise violate the rules of war. That position was
shared at the time by Eric H. Holder Jr., now the U.S. attorney general.
In 2002, in a CNN interview, Holder stated: \"It seems to me that given
the way in which they have conducted themselves, however, that they are
not, in fact, people entitled to the protection of the Geneva
Convention. They are not prisoners of war.\" Another controversial legal
position advanced in the memos was that provisions of the Bill of Rights
did not apply beyond the shores of the United States, particularly to
wartime conduct. For authority, the memo cited the case of Harbury vs.
Deutch, in which a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of
Appeals held in 2000 that the 5th Amendment does not apply abroad to
claims of torture by CIA-paid agents against foreign nationals. At issue
were allegations of torture that occurred over an 18-month period \--
half of it during the first year of the Clinton administration and that,
according to the complaint, included this: \"They chained and bound him
naked to a bed, beat and threatened him, and encased him in a fullbody
cast to prevent escape.\" The appeals court accepted the arguments made
by Wilma Lewis, a U.S. attorney during the Clinton administration, that
the 5th Amendment does not apply to claims of torture involving \"an
alien rebel commander leading an attempt violently to overthrow a
foreign government,\" even when the torture was alleged to have been
committed by paid agents of, and at the request or at least full
knowledge of, the CIA. The opinion was written by Judge David S. Tatel,
a Clinton appointee, and joined by Judge Harry T. Edwards, a Carter
appointee, and Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee. Even the
controversy about the 4th Amendment in the most recently released memo
is not as clear-cut as Yoo\'s opponents would have it. The 1972 Supreme
Court decision they rely on in their arguments indeed held that the 4th
Amendment requires a warrant for electronic surveillance of U.S.
citizens in domestic security matters. But the opinion for the court by
Justice Lewis F. Powell expressly left open the question of whether
those requirements would apply to domestic surveillance of agents of
foreign powers. Powell strongly suggested that they would not, favorably
citing a District Court decision that drew such a distinction because
the Supreme Court had long recognized the president\'s \"inherent power
with respect to foreign relations.\" In other words, whether the 4th
Amendment limited the president\'s commander-in-chief power to conduct
surveillance of enemy agents on our soil, in time of war, was a close
enough question that the Supreme Court had not resolved it. Yoo\'s
position was therefore hardly incompetent and indefensible, as some of
his detractors claim. Indeed, it would be incompetent and indefensible
for Yoo to have ignored Powell\'s caveat and concluded that the case
resolved a question the court explicitly left open. [After 9/11, the
lawyers at the Justice Department faced unprecedented legal questions.
They had been given the task of identifying the executive powers that
could legally be brought to bear]{.underline} [to prevent future
attacks. That they were aggressive in their legal interpretations should
come as no surprise]{.underline}, given the circumstances. [In the end,
the president\'s options were more thoroughly vetted by lawyers than at
any wartime era in our nation\'s history]{.underline}. There were no
wholesale detentions based on race, such as occurred under President
Roosevelt in World War II. No systematic suppression of antiwar speech,
such as under President Wilson in World War I. [That there is a great
deal of disagreement about the constitutionality of the lines the
lawyers drew is also no surprise \-- the Constitution deliberately keeps
the lines between congressional and executive wartime
powers,]{.underline} and between those branches and the courts,
deliberately [ambiguous. But disagreement about closely contested issues
hardly supports the exaggerated claims that Yoo]{.underline} and his
colleagues [shredded the Constitution, or that he should not be teaching
law]{.underline}.

Q. When I refer to the government of the United States in text, should
it be U.S. Federal Government or U.S. federal government? A. [The
[government]{.mark} of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[is **not a single**]{.mark} **official
[entity]{.mark}**. Nor is it [when]{.mark} it is [referred to as
the]{.mark}]{.underline} federal government or the U.S. government or
the [U.S. [federal government]{.mark}. It's just a
[government]{.mark}]{.underline}, which, like those in all countries,
[[has some]{.mark} official [bodies]{.mark} that act and **[operate in

"The Tulane Speech: What I Meant", Washington Post, 11-13, Lexis)

[The burden]{.underline} of The Post\'s editiorial
[concerned]{.underline} what I believe [about the force of Supreme Court
decisions]{.underline}. Does a ruling have general applicability beyond
the case itself? May public officials and private citizens choose to
ignore them at will? Putting the worst construction on what I did not
say, The Post wondered whether the speech might be \"an invitation to
constitutional chaos and an expression of contempt for the federal
judiciary and the rule of law.\" I believe it is important not only to
put these concerns to rest but also to emphasize again the point of the
speech \-- that our Constitution is the supreme or paramount law of the
land. [Supreme [Court decisions]{.mark} do, of course, [have general
applicability. In addition]{.mark} to **[binding]{.mark} the
[parties]{.mark}** in the case [at hand, a decision is binding precedent
on]{.mark} lower [federal]{.mark} courts [as well as state
courts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further, such decisions, as Lincoln once
said, are \"entitled to very high respect and consideration in all
parallel cases\" by the other departments of government, both federal
 \[\*1004\]  and state. Arguments from prudence, the need for stability
in the law, and respect for the judiciary will and should persuade
officials of these other institutions to abide by a decision of the
Court. It would be highly irresponsible for them not to conform their
behavior to precedent. I quite agree with The Post that, for example,
the general principle laid down in Brown v. Board of Education

struck down Texas abortion law, but also contained a principle that
officials in other states were obliged to apply. Constitutional
[[decisions by the Court]{.underline}]{.mark} are not \"the supreme law
of the land\" in the sense that the Constitution is. But they [[are
**law**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as I said at Tulane, and they are the law
of the land in the sense that they do indeed have general applicability
and deserve the greatest respect from all Americans.
