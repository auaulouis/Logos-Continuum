The [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can't
**fall**]{.mark} **[back]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} [**deterrence**]{.mark}
in **space**]{.underline}, whether by denial or punishment. [No
one]{.underline} today [finds U.S. space assets too
**daunting**]{.underline} to think of attacking. Satellites follow
predictable orbits --- the lowest of which can be reached by a missile
within five to 15 minutes --- and they and their ground stations are
equally vulnerable to non-kinetic attacks such as laser dazzling,
electronic jamming, and cyber attacks. Countries like [[China]{.mark}
and [Russia]{.mark} are exploiting this]{.underline}, which is why
they've developed arsenals of anti-satellite systems.
[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [and
[Iran]{.mark} are also in the **hunt**]{.underline}. [With [so few
sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark} [of their]{.mark} [own]{.mark} to
protect]{.underline}, [[they can]{.mark} [**focus on** **playing
offense**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Deterrence by punishment, [the [threat of U.S.]{.mark}
[retribution]{.mark} after an attack]{.underline}, also [seems
**[feeble]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [first problem is
**attribution**]{.underline}. Although early warning systems would
likely spot the heat flares accompanying an anti-satellite missile
attack, [[determining]{.mark} the [source of]{.mark} a]{.underline}
sophisticated [cyber [attack]{.mark} [is]{.mark} **far more
[challenging]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Absent a "smoking gun"
anti-satellite missile launch, [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would find it **difficult** to make a **persuasive
case** for **retaliation**]{.underline} should a sensitive (or
classified) space asset suddenly go offline, particularly if officials
were uncertain why. [There are tens of millions of pieces of **space
debris too small to track**]{.underline} already in Earth's orbits. [How
do you prove that space litter was not guilty]{.underline}?

[[Assuming]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} persuasively
[[attribute]{.mark} the attack]{.underline}, then [it [must]{.mark}
**convincingly [defend]{.mark}** [against it]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[America [has **limited means** of doing so]{.mark}]{.underline} but
[they are **highly classified** and would seem abstract]{.underline} and
hard to believe [to the world's citizens]{.underline}. Forget the pretty
pictures of the Rover on Mars --- space attacks involve tracking bullets
or lasers. [America must be able to **show** its **strength** without
**compromising** its **sources**]{.underline}. The U.S. House Armed
Services Committee is already focusing on reducing such
over-classification.

#### Space governance [fails]{.underline}.

Dr. Steven **Lambakis 18**, Director of Space Studies and Senior Defense
Analyst at the National Institute for Public Policy, Ph.D. at Catholic
University, and Managing Editor of Comparative Strategy, "Foreign Space
Capabilities: Implications for U.S. National Security", Comparative
Strategy, Volume 37, Issue 2, p. 135

A recent unclassified national security space strategy report provides
no indication that the Obama Administration was preparing to actively
counter the space capabilities of adversaries; rather, the Obama
Administration apparently was attempting to balance its highly
idealistic language with the potential realities of conflict. Yet it
must be pointed out that [U.S. leadership]{.underline} in the world
today [is predicated heavily on its **military might**. Leading by
**example without strength**]{.underline} to bear against those who
would transgress U.S. interests [would most likely lead the nation to
**retreat** from the defense of its interests]{.underline}. Moreover,
[such a **display of weakness** could **lead to attacks** on the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. [[**History** does
**not** tell us]{.mark} that merely [leading by example]{.mark} through
living responsibly and peacefully [is]{.mark} the [best]{.mark} way to
defend the nation. Why would we expect this tactic to work in
space?]{.underline} Today, counter-space operations against U.S. assets
are getting attention, but there seems to be no attention given to
providing the United States with capabilities to counter the hostile
space activities of other nations.

[There is significant discussion]{.underline} in official circles today
[about bolstering behavioral norms in space. But [to **whose "norms"**
will nations adhere?]{.mark}]{.underline} As the U.S. Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Space, Doug Loverro put it, "we don't want
people shooting at satellites, we don't believe that's a good thing for
mankind."280 It has also been said that the establishment of norms
"serves as a reminder that any battle for control over the use of space
to support military operations begins well before forces begin to
mobilize on Earth."281

[[We **cannot assume**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [that the
[norms]{.mark} which [other states adopt will be **those**]{.mark}
**norms [we deem appropriate]{.mark}** to ensure peaceful actions and
safe behavior in space. The last decade is **replete** with examples of
other countries]{.underline}, some of which are potential adversaries of
the United States, [practicing direct ascent ASAT
maneuvers]{.underline}; one of these was destructive, demonstrating
co-orbital ASAT operations, and practicing reversible interference
through jamming of radio signals or dazzling infrared sensors. [The norm
of [**self-serving behavior** that **advances national goals** is **the
norm**]{.mark} that has been **[most obvious]{.mark}** in international
relations for centuries. And, this norm has been **reflected [in
space]{.mark}** over the past 10 years. [Are]{.mark} efforts to create
benign ["rules of the road"]{.mark} likely [to **replace** this]{.mark}
norm[?]{.mark}]{.underline} While possible in principle, [it seems
**[extremely unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and would be highly
imprudent to assume as a basis for defense planning.

[Another norm]{.underline} that characterizes the current age and should
inform our thinking about space [is invasion of sovereign
nations]{.underline}. In February 2014, Russia's president Vladimir
Putin invaded Ukraine, starting with the [annexation of
[Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline} (part of Ukraine). Since the invasion, more
than 10,000 Ukrainians have been killed. This [has [happened
**despite**]{.mark} international [norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, treaties,
and agreements that condemn such aggressive behavior and consider it to
be politically shameful; indeed, [international [agreements and
shaming]{.mark} speeches [have been]{.mark} **entirely
[ineffectual]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Ukrainians either did not
consider that such a transgression could occur, or believed that the
world would rally to their side to push back the invasion. Neither
belief, of course, was based in reality. All that matters today are the
facts on the ground---i.e., the nature of the regimes confronting us and
the strategies they are pursuing.

There are broad national security implications of not having access to
space. On land, at sea, and in the air, the United States customarily
strives for peaceful, safe, and responsible behavior to avoid accidents,
ensure international tensions do not flare up, and essentially
collaborate with other states to ensure a stable, predictable
environment---but it does so armed all the same, prepared to defend
interests in each of those environments. Why? [Because [**history is
replete** with]{.mark} **violations** of **[broken]{.mark}** conventions
and international **[agreements]{.mark}**, and because **peace does not
last**]{.underline}.

Michael **Listner 18**, JD, Attorney and Founder and Principal of Space
Law and Policy Solutions, President and CEO of the International Space
Safety Foundation, "The Art of Lawfare and the Real War in Outer Space",
The Space Review, 9/17/2018,
http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3571/1

[**[Lawfare]{.mark}** in space [continued]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
intervening years between Sputnik-1 and the signature and ratification
of the Outer Space Treaty and afterward. [[The weapon of choice:
disarm]{.mark}ament [proposals]{.mark} for outer space]{.underline}.
Provisions for banning so-called space weapons in the Outer Space Treaty
were rejected by the Soviet Union in favor of separate arms control
measures.10 These measures included proposals, some of which related to
the proscription of ASATs, designed to not only gain an advantage in
outer space but to gauge political intent and resolve.11

The lawfare offensive escalated after the proposed Strategic Defense
Initiative with an effort curtail space-based missile defense technology
through a ban on so-called space weapons and a proverbial arms race in
outer space. The Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS),
introduced in 1985, continues to seek a legally binding measure to place
any weapon in outer space, including those designed for self-defense.
[It spawned measures [such as]{.mark} the]{.underline} Prevention of the
Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force against
Outer Space Objects [[(PPWT)]{.mark}, co-sponsored [by Russia and
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. This and other measures have met resistance
as unverifiable and certainly are not likely to gain the advice and
consent of the US Senate for ratification. The end game of the use of
lawfare in the form of efforts like PAROS---the latest attempt at which
was defeated in Geneva---is to propose legally binding measures that
proponents would ignore to their advantage in any event. The sponsors
and advocates of these hard-law measures recognize they will not come to
fruition but, in the process of promoting them, will enhance their soft
power and moral authority, which can be applied to entice their
adversary down.

Non-binding resolutions and measures in the form of political agreements
and guidelines are being used concurrently in the lawfare engagement in
outer space, where proposals for legally binding measures alone fall
short of the goal of creating hard law and challenging dominance in
outer space. These resolutions and measures, which emphasize
sustainability, are designed to perform an end run around the
formalities of a treaty to entice agreement on issues that would
otherwise be unacceptable in a hard-law agreement. These measures have
the dual effect to create soft-power support on the one hand and hard
law on the other. [[This]{.mark} tool of lawfare, [which uses **clichés
of cooperation**]{.mark} and sustainability, [is a **ploy** that
applies]{.mark} the [ambiguous]{.mark} nature of **[c]{.mark}**ustomary
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[l]{.mark}**aw to achieve what cannot be
done through treaties: [to]{.mark} "entice the adversary away" and
[create]{.mark} legal and political [constraints to]{.mark} bind and
[degrade]{.mark} its [use]{.mark} of outer space [or prevent it from
maintaining]{.mark} its [superiority]{.mark}, all the [while allowing
others to play **catchup**]{.mark} and replace one form of dominance
with another]{.underline}. While lawfare is by nature asymmetric, this
indirect approach could be considered a subset an irregular tactic of
lawfare, as opposed to the use of formal treaties in lawfare.

The crux is that, like space objects used in outer space, international
law and its implements are dual-use in that they can be used for
proactive ends or weaponized, with those using the appliances of lawfare
to encourage cession of the high ground choosing the latter rather than
the former. [[The decision]{.mark} to weaponize international law and
its institutions to prosecute this war in space **[brings into question
the efficacy of new]{.mark} rules or [norms]{.mark}**. Indeed, [the idea
of expanding]{.mark} the jurisprudence of outer space [through custom,
as]{.mark} being [suggested by]{.mark} the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [and more recently gap-filling rules being
suggested by [academia]{.mark} that could become custom, [presents the
real chance that, **rather than**]{.mark} **the [creation of]{.mark} the
ploughshare of [sustainability]{.mark}**[, **new**]{.mark} **and [more
effective swords]{.mark}** for lawfare [will be
**forged**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Max **Boot 11**, Senior Fellow in National Security Studies at the
Council on Foreign Relations, MA in History from Yale University, BA in
History from UC Berkeley, Columnist for the Washington Post, "We Cannot
Afford to Stop Drone Strikes", Commentary Magazine, 10/9/2011,
https://www.commentarymagazine.com/american-society/military/drone-arms-race/

The New York Times engages in some scare-mongering today about a drone
ams race. Scott Shane notes correctly other nations such as China are
building their own drones and in the future U.S. forces could be
attacked by them--our forces will not have a monopoly on their use
forever. Fair enough, but he goes further, suggesting our current use of
drones to target terrorists will backfire:

> If China, for instance, sends killer drones into Kazakhstan to hunt
> minority Uighur Muslims it accuses of plotting terrorism, what will
> the United States say? What if India uses remotely controlled craft to
> hit terrorism suspects in Kashmir, or Russia sends drones after
> militants in the Caucasus? American officials who protest will likely

> most."

This [[is a]{.mark} **familiar [trope]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} liberal
[critics who]{.mark} are always [claim]{.mark}ing [we should **forego
"X"**]{.mark} **weapons system or [capability]{.mark}**, otherwise our
enemies will adopt it too. We have heard this with regard to ballistic
missile defense, ballistic missiles, nuclear weapons, chemical and
biological weapons, land mines, exploding bullets, and other fearsome
weapons. Some have even suggested the U.S. should abjure the first use
of nuclear weapons]{.underline}--and cut down our own arsenal--[to
encourage similar restraint from Iran]{.underline}.

[The argument falls apart rather quickly because it is [founded on a
**false premise**: that **other nations**]{.mark} **will [follow our
example]{.mark}**. In point of fact, [Iran is **hell-bent**]{.mark} on
getting nuclear weapons **[no matter what we do]{.mark}**; China is
hell-bent on getting drones; and so forth]{.underline}. Whether and
under what circumstances they will use those weapons remains an open
question--but [[there is **little reason** to think
self-restraint]{.mark} on our part [will be **matched** by]{.mark} equal
self-restraint on [theirs]{.mark}. Is Pakistan avoiding nuking India
because we haven't used nuclear weapons since 1945? **Hardly**. The
reason is that India has a powerful nuclear deterrent to use against
Pakistan]{.underline}. If there is one lesson of history it is a strong
deterrent is a better upholder of peace than is unilateral
disarmament--which is what the New York Times implicitly suggests.

Imagine if we did refrain from drone strikes against al-Qaeda--what
would be the consequence? [If we were to stop]{.underline} the strikes,
[would China]{.underline} really decide to [take a softer
line]{.underline} on Uighurs [or Russia]{.underline} on Chechen
separatists[? That seems **unlikely** given the viciousness those states
already employ]{.underline} in their battles against ethnic
separatists--which at least in Russia's case already includes the
suspected assassination of Chechen leaders abroad. What's the difference
between sending a hit team and sending a drone?

While [[a decision on **our part**]{.underline}]{.mark} to stop drone
strikes [[would be **unlikely to alter Russian or Chinese
thinking**]{.underline}]{.mark}, it would have one immediate
consequence: al-Qaeda would be strengthened and could regenerate the
ability to attack our homeland. Drone strikes are the only effective
weapon we have to combat terrorist groups in places like Pakistan or
Yemen where we don't have a lot of boots on the ground or a lot of
cooperation from local authorities. We cannot afford to give them up in
the vain hope it will encourage disarmament on the part of dictatorial
states.

### SSA ADV\-\--Space Governance Turn\-\--1NC

#### The perception of US space governance leads to [unchecked escalation]{.underline} and triggers an [arms race]{.underline}.

Theresa **Hitchens, 8** (Theresa Hitchens is the president of the Center
for Defense Information, February 2008, accessed on 7-1-2022, Scientific
American, \"Space Wars - Coming to the Sky Near You?\",
http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you,
HBisevac)

Perhaps of even [greater concern is that [several]{.mark} other
[nations]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} one of China's
regional rivals, [India]{.underline}, [[may feel **compelled** to
**seek**]{.mark}]{.underline} ­[[**offensive** as well as]{.mark}
**[defensive capabilities in space]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.S.
trade journal Defense News, for instance, quoted unidentified Indian
defense officials as stating that their country had already begun
developing its own kinetic-energy (nonexplosive, hit-to-kill) and
laser-based antisatellite weapons.

[If India goes down that path]{.underline}, its [archrival Pakistan
will]{.underline} probably [**follow suit**.]{.underline} Like India,
[Pakistan has a well-developed ballistic missile program, including
medium-range missiles that could launch an antisatellite
system]{.underline}. [Even Japan,]{.underline} the third major Asian
power, [might join such a **space race**]{.underline}. In June 2007 the
National Diet of Japan began considering a bill backed by the current
Fukuda government that would permit the development of satellites for
"military and national security" purposes.

As for Russia, in the wake of the Chinese test President Vladimir Putin
reiterated Moscow's stance against the weaponization of space. At the
same time, though, he refused to criticize Beijing's actions and blamed
the U.S. instead. The American efforts to build a missile defense
system, Putin charged, and the increasingly aggressive American plans
for a military position in space were prompting China's moves. Yet
[Russia]{.underline} itself, as a major spacefaring power that has
incorporated satellites into its national security structure, [would be
hard-pressed to forgo entering an **arms race in space**.]{.underline}

[Given the proliferation of spacefaring entities]{.underline},
[proponents of a **robust space warfare strategy** believe that
***arming the heavens*** is inevitable and that it would be best for the
U.S. to get there first]{.underline} with firepower. Antisatellite and
space-based weapons, they argue, will be necessary not only to defend
U.S. military and commercial satellites but also to deny any future
adversary the use of space capabilities to enhance the performance of
its forces on the battlefield.

Yet [[**any arms race in space** would]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
[inevitably **destabilize** the **balance of power** and thereby
**[multiply]{.mark}** the [**risks** of **global
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such headlong competition---whether
in space or elsewhere---[equilibrium among the adversaries would be
**virtually impossible** to maintain]{.underline}. [Even if]{.underline}
the [major powers did **achieve stability**]{.underline}, [that reality
would still provide **no guarantee** that both sides would perceive it
to be so]{.underline}. [[The moment one side saw itself]{.mark} to be
[slipping]{.mark} behind the other]{.underline}, [the first side [would
be strongly tempted to launch a **preemptive
strike**]{.mark}]{.underline}, before things got even worse. Ironically,
the same would hold for the side that perceived itself to have gained an
advantage. Again, [[there would be strong temptation to **strike
first**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[before the adversary could catch
up]{.underline}]{.mark}. Finally, a [space weapons race would ratchet up
the chances that a mere [technological mistake could **trigger a
battle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, in the distant void, [reliably
[distinguishing an intentional act from an accidental one would be
**highly problematic**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Hit-to-Kill Interceptors

According to assessments by U.S. military and intelligence officials as
well as by independent experts, the Chinese probably destroyed their
weather satellite with a kinetic-energy vehicle boosted by a two-stage
medium-range ballistic missile. Technologically, launching such
direct-ascent antisatellite weapons is one of the simplest ways to take
out a satellite. About a dozen nations and consortia can reach low Earth
orbit (between roughly 100 and 2,000 kilometers, or 60 to 1,250 miles,
high) with a medium-range missile; eight of those countries can reach
geostationary orbit (about 36,000 kilometers, or 22,000 miles, above
Earth).

But the real technical hurdle to making a hit-to-kill vehicle is not
launch capacity; it is the precision maneuverability and guidance
technology needed to steer the vehicle into its target. Just how well
China has mastered those techniques is unclear. Because the weather
satellite was still operating when it was destroyed, the Chinese
operators would have known its exact location at all times.

Ground-Based Lasers

The test of China's direct-ascent antisatellite device came on the heels
of press reports in September 2006 that the Chinese had also managed to
"paint," or illuminate, U.S. spy satellites with a ground-based laser
\[see lower box on page 83\]. Was Beijing actually trying to "blind" or
otherwise damage the satellites? No one knows, and no consensus seems to
have emerged in official Washington circles about the Chinese intent.
Per­haps China was simply testing how well its network of low-power
laser-ranging stations could track American orbital observation
platforms.

Even so, the test was provocative. Not all satellites have to be
electronically "fried" to be put out of commission. A 1997 test of the
army's MIRACL system (for midinfrared advanced chemical laser) showed
that satellites designed to collect optical images can be temporarily
disrupted---dazzled---by low-power beams. It follows that among the
satellites vulnerable to such an attack are the orbital spies.

The U.S. and the former Soviet Union began experimenting with
laser-based antisatellite weapons in the 1970s. Engineers in both
countries have focused on the many problems of building high-power laser
systems that could reliably destroy low-flying satellites from the
ground. Such systems could be guided by "adaptive optics": deformable
mirrors that can continuously compensate for atmospheric distortions.
But tremendous amounts of energy would be needed to feed high-power
lasers, and even then the range and effectiveness of the beams would be
severely limited by dispersion, by attenuation as they passed through
smoke or clouds, and by the difficulty of keeping the beams on-target
long enough to do damage.

During the development of the SDI, the U.S. conducted several laser
experiments from Hawaii, including a test in which a beam was bounced
off a mirror mounted on a satellite. Laser experiments continue at the
Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico.
Pentagon budget documents from fiscal years 2004 through 2007 listed
antisatellite operations among the goals of the Starfire research, but
that language was removed from budget documents in fiscal year 2008
after Congress made inquiries. The Starfire system incorporates adaptive
optics that narrow the outgoing laser beam and thus increase the density
of its power. That capability is not required for imagery or tracking,
further suggesting that Starfire could be used as a weapon.

Yet despite decades of work, battle-ready versions of directed-energy
weapons still seem far away. An air force planning document, for
instance, predicted in 2003 that a ground-based weapon able to
"propagate laser beams through the atmosphere to \[stun or kill low
Earth orbit\] satellites" could be available between 2015 and 2030.
Given the current state of research, even those dates seem optimistic.

Co-orbital Satellites

Recent advances in miniaturized sensors, powerful onboard computers and
efficient rocket thrusters have made a third kind of antisatellite
technology increasingly feasible: the offensive microsatellite. One
example that demonstrates the potential is the air force's experimental
satellite series (XSS) project, which is developing microsatellites
intended to conduct "autonomous proximity operations" around larger
satellites. The first two microsatellites in the program, the XSS-10 and
XSS-11, were launched in 2003 and 2005. Though ostensibly intended to
inspect larger satellites, such microsatellites could also ram target
satellites or carry explosives or directed-energy payloads such as
radio-frequency jamming systems or high-powered microwave emitters. Air
force budget documents show that the XSS effort is tied to a program
called Advanced Weapons Technology, which is dedicated to research on
military laser and microwave systems.

During the cold war the Soviet Union developed, tested and even declared
operational a co-orbital antisatellite system---a maneuverable
interceptor with an explosive payload that was launched by missile into
an orbit near a target satellite in low Earth orbit. In effect, the
device was a smart "space mine," but it was last demonstrated in 1982
and is probably no longer working. Today such an interceptor would
likely be a microsatellite that could be parked in an orbit that would
cross the orbits of several of its potential targets. It could then be
activated on command during a close encounter.

In 2005 the air force described a program that would provide "localized"
space "situational awareness" and "anomaly characterization" for
friendly host satellites in geostationary orbit. The program is dubbed
ANGELS (for autonomous nanosatellite guardian for evaluating local
space), and the budget line believed to represent it focuses on
acquiring "high value space asset defensive capabilities," including a
"warning sensor for detection of a direct ascent or co-orbital vehicle."
It is clear that such guardian nanosatellites could also serve as
offensive weapons if they were maneuvered close to enemy satellites.

And the list goes on. A "parasitic satellite" would shadow or even
attach itself to a target in geostationary orbit. Farsat, which was
mentioned in an appendix to the \[Donald\] Rumsfeld Space Commission
report in 2001, "would be placed in a 'storage' orbit (perhaps with many
microsatellites housed inside) relatively far from its target but ready
to be maneuvered in for a kill."

Finally, the air force proposed some time ago a space-based
radio-frequency weapon system, which "would be a constellation of
satellites containing high-power radio-frequency transmitters that
possess the capability to disrupt/­destroy/disable a wide variety of
electronics and national-level command and control systems."

Air force planning documents from 2003 envisioned that such a technology
would emerge after 2015. But outside experts think that orbital
radio-frequency and microwave weapons are technically feasible today and
could be deployed in the relatively near future.

Space Bombers

Though not by definition a space weapon, the Pentagon's Common Aero
Vehicle/Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (often called CAV) enters into
this discussion because, like an ICBM, it would travel through space to
strike Earth-bound targets. An unpowered but highly maneuverable
hypersonic glide vehicle, the CAV would be deployed from a future
hypersonic space plane, swoop down into the atmosphere from orbit and
drop conventional bombs on ground targets. Congress recently began
funding the project but, to avoid stoking a potential arms race in
space, has prohibited any work to place weapons on the CAV. Although
engineers are making steady progress on the key technologies for the CAV
program, both the vehicle and its space plane mothership are still
likely decades off.

Some of the congressional sensitivity to the design of the CAV may have
arisen from another, much more controversial space weapons concept with
parallel goals: hypervelocity rod bundles that would be dropped to Earth
from orbital platforms. For decades air force planners have been
thinking about placing weapons in orbit that could strike terrestrial
targets, particularly buried, "hardened" bunkers and caches of weapons
of mass destruction. Commonly called "rods from God," the bundles would
be made up of large tungsten rods, each as long as six meters (20 feet)
and 30 centimeters (12 inches) across. Each rod would be hurled downward
from an orbiting spacecraft and guided to its target at tremendous
speed.

Both high costs and the laws of physics, however, challenge their
feasibility. Ensuring that the projectiles do not burn up or deform from
reentry friction while sustaining a precise, nearly vertical flight path
would be extremely difficult. Calculations indicate that the
nonexplosive rods would probably be no more effective than more
conventional munitions. Furthermore, the expense of lofting the heavy
projectiles into orbit would be exorbitant. Thus, despite continued
interest in them, rods from God seem to fall into the realm of science
fiction.

Obstacles to Space Weapons

What, then, is holding the U.S. (and other nations) back from a
full-bore pursuit of space weapons? The countervailing pressures are
threefold: political opposition, technological challenges and high
costs.

The American body politic is deeply divided over the wisdom of making
space warfare a part of the national military strategy. The risks are
manifold. I remarked earlier on the general instabilities of an arms
race, but there is a further issue of stability among the nuclear
powers. Early-warning and spy satellites have traditionally played a
crucial role in reducing fears of a surprise nuclear attack. But if
antisatellite weapons disabled those eyes-in-the-sky, the resulting
uncertainty and distrust could rapidly lead to catastrophe.

One of the most serious technological challenges posed by space weapons
is the proliferation of space debris, to which I alluded earlier.
According to investigators at the air force, NASA and Celestrak (an
independent space-monitoring Web site), the Chinese antisatellite test
left more than 2,000 pieces of junk, baseball-size and larger, orbiting
the globe in a cloud that lies between about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
and 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) above Earth's surface. Perhaps
another 150,000 objects that are a centimeter (half an inch) across and
larger were released. High orbital velocities make even tiny pieces of
space junk dangerous to spacecraft of all kinds. And ground stations
cannot reliably monitor or track objects smaller than about five
centimeters (two inches) across in low Earth orbit (around a meter in
geostationary orbit), a capability that might enable satellites to
maneuver out of the way. To avoid being damaged by the Chinese space
debris, in fact, two U.S. satellites had to alter course. Any shooting
war in space would raise the specter of a polluted space environment no
longer navigable by Earth-orbiting satellites.

Basing weapons in orbit also pre­sents difficult technical obstacles.
They would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all kinds of
outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic signals, even
natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against such threats
would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is bulky and adds
mass, thereby greatly increasing launch costs. Orbital weapons would be
mostly autonomous mechanisms, which would make operational errors and
failures likely. The paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to
predict, which would make hiding large weapons problematic. And because
satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a
time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many
weapons.

Finally, getting into space and operating there is extremely expensive:
between \$2,000 and \$10,000 a pound to reach low Earth orbit and
between \$15,000 and \$20,000 a pound for geostationary orbit. Each
space-based weapon would require replacement every seven to 15 years,
and in-orbit repairs would not be cheap, either.

Alternatives to Space Warfare

Given the risks of space warfare to national and international security,
as well as the technical and financial hurdles that must be overcome, it
would seem only prudent for spacefaring nations to find ways to prevent
an arms race in space. The [U.S. focus has been to reduce the
vulnerability of its satellite fleet]{.underline} and explore
alternatives to its dependence on satellite services. [Most other
space-capable countries are instead seeking multilateral diplomatic and
legal measures]{.underline}. The options range from treaties that would
ban antisatellite and space-based weapons to voluntary measures that
would help build transparency and mutual confidence.

The Bush administration has adamantly opposed any form of negotiations
regarding space weapons. Opponents of multilateral space weapons
agreements contend that others (particularly China) will sign up but
build secret arsenals at the same time, because such treaty violations
cannot be detected. They argue further that the U.S. cannot sit idly as
potential adversaries gain spaceborne resources that could enhance their
terrestrial combat capabilities.

Proponents of international treaties counter that [**[failure to
negotiate]{.mark}** such [agreements]{.mark} entails real opportunity
costs]{.underline}. An [arms race in space [may end up **compromising
the security of all nations**]{.mark},]{.underline} including that of
the U.S., while it stretches the economic capacities of the competitors
to the breaking point. And whereas many advocates of a space weapons ban
concede that it will be difficult to construct a fully verifiable
treaty---because space technology can be used for both military and
civilian ends---effective treaties already exist that do not require
strict verification. A good example is the Biological Weapons
Convention. Certainly a prohibition on the testing and use (as opposed
to the deployment) of the most dangerous class of near-term space
weapons---destructive (as opposed to jamming) antisatellite
systems---would be easily verifiable, because earthbound observers can
readily detect orbital debris. Furthermore, [any party to a treaty would
know that all its space launches would be tracked from the
ground]{.underline}, and [any suspicious object in orbit would promptly
be labeled as such]{.underline}. The [**[international outcry]{.mark}**
that [would ensue from **such overt treaty violations**]{.mark} could
deter would-be violators]{.underline}.

Since the mid-1990s, however, [progress on establishing a new
multilateral space regime has lagged]{.underline}. The U.S. has blocked
efforts at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to
begin negotiations on a treaty to ban space weapons. China, meanwhile,
has refused to accept anything less. Hence, intermediate measures such
as voluntary confidence-building, space traffic control or a code of
responsible conduct for spacefaring nations have remained stalled.

Space warfare is not inevitable. But the [recent policy shift in the
U.S. and China's provocative actions have highlighted the fact that the
world is approaching a **crossroads**]{.underline}. Countries must come
to grips with their strong self-interest in preventing the testing and
use of orbital weapons. The nations of Earth must soon decide whether it
is possible to sustain the predominantly peaceful human space
exploration that has already lasted half a century. The [likely
alternative would be **unacceptable to all**.]{.underline}

#### Space arms racing spills over to South Asia\-\--escalates the nuclear security trilemma.

[The peculiar nature of]{.underline} [bilateral [relations between the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
China in space is the **triggering point** of a]{.mark} **space
[security trilemma in South Asia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The spillover
effect of]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[misperception]{.underline}]{.mark}**-misunderstanding dynamic
[[between the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and China in]{.underline}]{.mark}
outer [[space]{.underline}]{.mark} has brought strategic
[[transform]{.underline}]{.mark}ation between the [bilateral [relations
among India]{.mark}-[China]{.mark}, India-Pakistan, [and]{.mark} China
[Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline}, accentuating a security trilemma. All
three states give high importance to their national space programs to
achieve socio economic goals and to fulfil their national security
needs. All three states also recognize the strategic importance of space
as a new arena of war. However, the power asymmetry in South Asia has
highlighted space-related capabilities as a potent medium of progress
and power accumulation. As a result, the challenges in space have
triggered and magnified the security trilemma for the South Asian
rivals, interconnecting China, India, and Pakistan in the context of an
international security complex.

The concept of a security trilemma was primarily conceived by Linton
Brooks and Mira Rapp-Hooper in their scholarly work titled, 'Strategic
Asia 2013-2014: Asia in the Second Nuclear Age.' Brooks and Rapp-Hooper
argue that the concept is applicable to South Asia, where the three
nuclear powers of China, India, and Pakistan interact in a triangular
security matrix that is formed around the imperative of an
offense-defence security environment. [The theme of a security trilemma
is based on the relations among India and Pakistan, China and India,
China and Pakistan, and China and the United States.]{.underline}

[South Asia has remained a region of concern for the international
community]{.underline}, [particularly for the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates in the past, [and]{.underline} it [is likely to
remain so in the future]{.underline}. This reflects the importance of
the South Asian region in the world politics and U.S. foreign security
policy calculus, primarily due to its political, strategic, and economic
significance, as well as the interests of other states associated with
the region. [The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
India]{.underline} presently [have a convergence of
geostrategic]{.underline} [interests]{.underline} in the region that has
led to realignment of their strategic relations. On the other hand, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and Pakistan have
unstable relations]{.underline} due to multiple factors, including the
presence of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, and due to
terrorism. The most interesting factor is **[U.S.]{.underline}**
rebalance [policy]{.underline} in the region, [which envisions
containing the rise of China]{.underline} and where India is playing an
instrumental role in helping the United States to achieve its strategic
interests in the region. This [constitutes a strategic chain reaction
when China tries to balance its relations with the United
States]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, [in turn]{.underline},
[negatively impacts its relations with India]{.underline}, [which
disturbs its relations with Pakistan]{.underline}. [This causes a
**ripple effect** in the bilateral relations between China-India,
India-Pakistan, and China-United States]{.underline}.

**[Space is a strategic domain]{.underline}**. It is also one of the
most important global commons, most notably in the twenty-first century
technologically driven security world where the future of geostrategic
affairs is expected to be largely determined by the technological,
cyber, and space capabilities of competing states. Strategically, space
has become the fourth medium of warfare, in addition to land, sea, and
air mediums. Concomitantly, space is analogous to these more traditional
mediums. Overall, the strategic importance of space for the major powers
has increased substantially since the launch of the first satellite into
outer space in 1957. Hence,the value and reliance on space capabilities
and their applications in the realms of communication networking,
navigation, intelligence gathering, photographic reconnaissance,
surveillance, and early warning purposes have increased manifold for the
major powers and other state actors.

In the twenty-first century, states aspire to accumulate power and
influence over economic, political, and technological areas, as well as
military power and space power. All of this is considered synonymous
with the symbols of power and prestige for technologically advanced
states. The desire to gather power is akin to technological advancement.
However, technological advancement cannot be achieved without
exploration of space for peaceful, strategic, and military uses to
achieve states' national security goals. Space has strategic
connotations for both spacefaring and non-spacefaring states because
space related capability has emerged as a potent medium of progress and
power. [The uses of the global commons of space for various conflicting
objectives are emerging as a potential cause of future
conflicts]{.underline}. In addition, **[space politics]{.underline}**
[at the global level among the major spacefaring states impacts
international and **regional security** environments]{.underline},
particularly in South Asia. The **[ongoing [space
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[between the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
China]{.underline}]{.mark} has created a space security trilemma for
Pakistan and India. This is primarily [[due to]{.underline}]{.mark}
international and regional geostrategic transformations that are rooted
in [[the Indo-U.S. space]{.underline}]{.mark} and strategic
[[partnership]{.underline}]{.mark}s. This, in turn,
[impacts]{.underline} the [security dynamics]{.underline} of South Asia,
and **[[negatively affects Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which is at
a power disadvantage in comparison to]{.underline} India.

The utilization of space power for states' national defence has become
an integral part of the national security strategy for India and
Pakistan. In this regard, [[India]{.underline}]{.mark} is also focusing
on [[expanding]{.underline}]{.mark} the orbit of its
[[space]{.underline}]{.mark} program for national defence and [[power
projection]{.underline}]{.mark} goals. This **[[will prompt Pakistan to
follow suit]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The **primary
factor**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[behind India's]{.underline}]{.mark}
growing [[space progress is]{.underline}]{.mark} partly due to
[[its]{.mark} perceived [fear of China's expanding space]{.mark}
program]{.underline}, and the latter's growing militarization and
[[weaponization]{.underline}]{.mark} [capabilities]{.underline}. On the
other hand, [[China's primary concern is **U.S. space
weaponization**]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities. The concerns,
vulnerabilities, and challenges in space trigger and magnify the
security trilemma for these South Asian rivals, interconnecting China,
India, and Pakistan in the context of an international security complex.
[This]{.underline} causes geopolitical dynamics and predicaments, such
as China versus the United States, India versus China, and Pakistan
versus India. Moreover, India has accelerated its space cooperation with
the United States and other countries that will complement its BMD
systems, which, from a Pakistani perspective, is a potent security
threat and a destabilizing development that [undermines]{.underline} the
**[strategic stability]{.underline}** [of South Asia]{.underline}. Such
developments place Pakistan under the sway of India's increasing
military and space dominance in the region. In sum, the space and
technological programs of the United States, China, and India magnify
the security trilemma between the regional states in South Asia.

[[The strategic environment of South Asia is]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[complex]{.underline}**, **[[ambiguous]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[volatile]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
**unpredictable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. South Asia is an important
region geostrategically and geopolitically. The [stability and security
of the region are dependent on Indo--Pakistani relations]{.underline},
[which have been strained for many years]{.underline}. The
[**[conventional asymmetry]{.underline}** [led to Pakistan's reliance
on]{.underline}]{.mark} [**nuclear** weapons and a **[first-use]{.mark}
policy**]{.underline}. The [[nuclear deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}
[between the two **[has been successful]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [no
major war has occurred since nuclearization]{.underline} (aside from the
Kargil standoff). Through its nuclear posture Islamabad has been able to
achieve objectives like dissuading the enemy from considering
aggression, deterring potential enemies, reducing dependence on allies,
and militaryindependence.46 [Pakistan has been trying to preserve the
credibility of its minimum nuclear deterrent since 1998]{.underline}.
Pakistan's proposed Strategic Restraint Regime would ban anti-ballistic
missiles and submarinelaunched missiles in the region.47
**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** India rejected the proposal, wanting to
balance the growing Chinese military muscle and engaging Pakistan in an
expensive arms race.

[[India's space weapons program]{.underline}]{.mark} will solidify its
defense and increase its options. It [[will]{.mark} also [have serious
repercussions for]{.mark} Indo--Pakistani]{.underline} relations and
**[[strategic stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in South Asia. [It will
heighten]{.underline} the [**asymmetry** between the declared
rivals]{.underline}, India and Pakistan. Further advancement and
deployment of Agni V will give New Delhi second-strike capability. This
will obviously have a negative effect on Pakistan's security. Pakistan's
space program is only in its initial phases. India is very far ahead,
and its rapid advancement in the field of space is alarming for
Pakistan.

To preserve its space assets, [[India]{.mark} has showed interest in
building [satellite killer devices]{.mark}, lasers, and military
satellites to support Indian forces]{.underline}. Space weapons are
unpredictable and fragile. [It [will be
**disastrous**]{.mark}]{.underline} for mankind [[if]{.mark} these
weapons are [placed in]{.mark} outer [space]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
attain space dominance by [[developing]{.mark} such dangerous [weapons
would]{.mark}]{.underline} not be a rational approach. It is therefore
recommended that alternative options be considered. India's space
weapons would have direct implications for Pakistan in particular.
Indian activities in space will **[[force Pakistan to make changes in
its nuclear posture]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[imperiling
stability]{.mark} and security]{.underline}.

**[[Indian space weaponization]{.underline}]{.mark}** will force
Pakistan to take measures to strengthen its defense forces. India's
having information about silos and the movement of troops, along with
the ability to hit them, will require precautionary measures from
Pakistan. Technological developments in the Indian space program could
be a great threat to Pakistan, so the Pakistani government must now pay
full attention to its space satellite program, to counter the Indian
hegemonic space threat, and not always rely on the US and China.
Pakistan receives technology from the US and China and does not possess
indigenous technology production. Pakistan's F-16s were provided by the
US, and Pakistan's space program is largely contingent on China's help.
Plansshould be made to speed the development of Pakistan's space
program. India has always impelled Pakistan to take defensive security
measures, as it did in 1998, when Pakistan had to test nuclear weapons
in the aftermath of India's nuclear tests.

Pakistan doesn't have its own launch vehicles or a launch pad for space
vehicles. Pakistan needs to have its own launch vehicle and a
geographically suitable place to build a launch pad. It is time for
Pakistan to have an indigenous space program, not reliant on anyone
else. Given the changing geostrategic environment, Pakistan must focus
on internal balancing.

India is working on expanding its conventional and nonconventional
military might, as is evident in its rising defense budget allocations.
Pakistan needs to pay special attention to this trend. Pakistan needs to
work on a more robust nuclear triad with the development of nuclear
submarines. Pakistan has made a significant development in this regard,
with the successful test of its Nasr solid-fueled multi-tube tactical
ballistic missile. Pakistan should go for nuclear submarines, which are
hard to detect and can remain underwater for long periods. It must
devise ways to overcome the economic challenge, to meet these increasing
defense demands. And Pakistan can take this issue to the United Nations
with the collaboration of other states, as its adversarial relations
with India endanger the security of all states.

The prevailing strategic environment will force Pakistan to take
measures to counter the threats to its security. The measures [[will
trigger an arms race]{.mark} in outer space [and]{.mark} will create
further instability]{.underline} in an already vulnerable South Asia.
[Efforts should be made at the global level to curb]{.underline} the
[proliferation of weapons in space]{.underline}, which is a global
common and should be prevented from becoming a battleground.

India's space program is growing at a very brisk pace. The main regional
issues of South Asia pivot around India--Pakistan rivalry. Space
weaponization in South Asia will have dire implications for strategic
stability. India's quest for space weaponization is motivated by
aspiration for supremacy and regional hegemony. India also wants to
balance its capabilities with those of China to counter China's growing
influence in South Asia. Closer analysis of the issue suggests that
given the historical relations between India and Pakistan, [India's
quest for space weaponization will [threaten]{.mark} the
[security]{.mark} of the region]{.underline}.

### SSA ADV\-\--Space Governance Turn\-\--2NC

#### Outweighs on [scope]{.underline} and [magnitude]{.underline} -- space weapons wipe out [all life in the universe]{.underline}.

Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and founder of the X-Risks Institute;

'Maxipok Rule'," vol. 100 p. 74-85; kp\]

[Another possibility involves [weaponizing "]{.mark}**minor
[planets]{.mark}**[" like **asteroids**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This hints
at the deflection dilemma discussed by Sagan (1994), among others,
whereby [the very same technology that could deflect an asteroid away
from Earth could also be used to **[redirect]{.mark} one** toward
it]{.underline}. The [resultant "**[planetoid bombs]{.mark}**" could be
launched in the direction of target civilizations at **extremely high
velocities** and [inflict far **greater destruction** than
**all**]{.mark} the [**nuclear arsenals** on Earth]{.mark}
**combined**]{.underline} (see Cole and Cox 1965; Deudney forthcoming).
Even more, [asteroids are **extremely numerous** in the solar system and
have a wide range of sizes, with estimates of 1.1 to 1.9 million that
have greater-than-1-kilometer diameters in the asteroid belt between
Mars and Jupiter]{.underline}. (A 1- kilometer impactor striking Earth
would likely annihilate humanity by causing an impact winter.)

Thus, [[**asteroids** constitute]{.mark} an [**abundant** source
of]{.mark} **easily obtainable**, [**civilization-ending**
weaponry]{.mark}]{.underline}---a particularly worrisome fact given that
the technological capabilities to redirect aster- oids will likely
emerge at an early stage in our diaspora "out of Earth," as it were (see
Deudney forthcoming).

[Other futuristic space weapons include **military [drones]{.mark}**
that either initiate attacks or engage in clandestine surveillance of
other civilizations]{.underline}. Such [drones could hide themselves
from counter-surveillance detectors by employing metamaterial
**invisibility cloaks** and propagate themselves through the [**von
Neumann process** of **self-replication**]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is,
by converting raw ma- terials into clones of themselves. [There is also
the possibility of using "**[heliobeams]{.mark}**," or "**sun guns**,"
to destroy targets by **concentrating** large amounts of **solar
radiation** via a **concave mirror** on a satellite. Even more
catastrophic are direct-energy weapons (**[DEWs]{.mark}**) like
**lasers** and **particle-beams** that use highly focused energy to
**superheat** their targets]{.underline}. In fact, the US government has
already developed weapons of this sort---they are science fact rather
than fiction---although fu- ture breakthroughs could enable them to
become immensely more destructive. If this is the case, they will offer
yet another mechanism for wreaking unprecedented harm (see Deudney
forthcom- ing). Along these lines, Anders Sandberg (forthcoming)
suggests that [technologically advanced civilizations could potentially
use **[gravitational waves]{.mark}** to **[create black
holes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Generating waves of sufficient intensity
would be energetically inefficient, according to current physics, but
they have the advantage that they can interact with dark matter objects,
unlike electromagnetic-energy weapons.

Even more, [the universe appears to be in a "**metastable**" energy
state. This suggests that one could tip it into a **more stable**,
**lower-energy state**, perhaps by concentrating huge quantities of
energy in tiny regions of spacetime]{.underline}, as occurs in some
high-powered physics experiments. In other words, [a [**particle
collider** could]{.mark} be weaponized to intentionally [**nucleate** a
"**vacuum bubble**,"]{.mark} or sphere of "true vacuum" spreading in all
directions at the **speed of light** and **[destroying
everything]{.mark}** with which it comes into contact]{.underline}. Who
might weaponize a particle collider? First, [there could be actors who
use the threat of a vacuum bubble for **blackmail**
purposes]{.underline}. Second, [there could be **madmen** (like Hitler)
who create a vacuum bubble to avoid defeat]{.underline}. That is to say,
a predatory actor could hold the following preference ordering: (i)
triumphant victory over, say, its Local Group, (ii) total annihilation
of the universe, and (iii) defeat. Third, **[particle
colliders]{.underline}** would also be the ideal WTD for RNUs, since it
[would enable them to **[obliterate]{.mark}** not only **[all]{.mark}
extant [life]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the **[universe]{.mark}** but the
very **potential for life to arise**]{.underline}---and it would do this
without inflicting any suffering whatsoever.xviii Another possibility is
that Tuckerian actors create a vac- uum bubble for the purely defensive
reason of eliminating all potential attackers in the universe. As
Sandberg (2017) speculates, it might be possible for "certain
configurations of matter, energy, black holes, etc. \[to\] induce a
post-transition structure that can act as an assembler." This "as-
sembler" would enable "some information \[to\] be transmitted into the
new state," thus making it possible for a civilization to "survive," in
some sense, the universe settling into a lower-energy configuration. On
the other side of this transition, the "structure" can recrudesce into a
daughter new civilization with the certitude that it is completely alone
and, therefore, safe.

Finally, [it is crucial to note that **[future
beings]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[some of whom may have hugely augmented
cognitive capacities]{.underline}---[[will]{.mark} almost certainly
[invent **new weapons**]{.mark} that are **[more]{.mark} powerful** and
[**effective** than **anything we could imagine**.]{.mark} Such weapons
could enable civilizations]{.underline}---or per- haps lone wolves, of
which there could be, once again, trillions and trillions and
trillions---[to cause **unprecedented injury** to other
civilizations]{.underline}. Consider the following passage from Bostrom
(2013):

[One can readily imagine a class of **existential-catastrophe
scenarios**]{.underline} in which some tech- nology is discovered that
puts immense destructive power into the hands of a large num- ber of
individuals. If there is no effective defense against this destructive
power, and no way to prevent individuals from having access to it, then
[**civilization cannot last**, since in a sufficiently large population
there are bound to be some individuals who will use any destructive
power available to them.]{.underline}

[Scale this up from the individual level to the **cosmopolitical level**
and the same conclusion fol- lows: [**Life in the universe** **cannot
last**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### [Turns case]{.underline}.

Gareth **Dorrian &** Ian **Whittaker, 19** (Gareth Dorrian; PhD in Solar
Terrestrial Physics and writer of public outreach articles for The
Conversation, Ian Whittaker; Senior Lecturer at the School of Science &
Technology at Nottingham Trust University, 10-21-2019, accessed on

that would work", <https://phys.org/news/2019-10-space-war-zone.html>,
HBisevac)

But [how would **sabotage** and **warfare** happen]{.underline} exactly?
One method involves [firing an **intense beam** of **microwave
radiation** at an object]{.underline}. In fact, such concepts have been
tested before by the police as a means of bringing a speeding car to a
halt by disabling electrical devices on the vehicle.

[Such a concept deployed on satellites]{.underline} would
[constitute]{.underline} a \"**[directed-energy weapon]{.underline}**\",
[enabling nations to disable other countries\' satellites]{.underline}
without creating large clouds of orbital debris. You could potentially
make such an attack look like an accident and deny involvement.

The [use of]{.underline} \"**[radio jamming]{.underline}**\" [to disrupt
radar and communications]{.underline} dates back to World War II. By
[swamping a radio receiver with]{.underline}, effectively, [radio
noise]{.underline}, one can [obscure the reception of genuine signals
and render the system **inoperative**]{.underline}. This is a little
like trying to spot the light from a candle against the glare of car
headlights.

Satellites are thoroughly tested for self generated radio noise before
going into space. But if a \"hostile\" satellite nearby were to
deliberately direct broadband radio transmissions at the target
satellite, then communications could be completely disrupted.

Space-based electronic warfare is likely to become an increasing concern
for military planners. In fact, many military services on Earth now
depend on space technology to work.

Kinetic kills and lasers

By far the most obvious method of interfering with a satellite is a
solid projectile. Moving [satellites have very high **kinetic energy**
and **momentum**]{.underline}. [If a slower moving object can be placed
briefly in the path of a satellite]{.underline}, then [the resultant
**collision** will be]{.underline} particularly
**[devastating]{.underline}**.

These so called \"kinetic kills\" have previously only been used to take
satellites out of commission at the end of their life, with the US,
Russia China, and India demonstrating their ability to perform this.
This type of removal consists of a ground-launched missile aimed at the
satellite. If aimed at an adversary satellite, such a missile would be
fairly obvious and could be tracked by other nations using radar.

A more subtle method would be to destroy a satellite owned by the
country or company launching the missile and aim to produce as much
debris as possible, which then lies in the orbital path of the intended
target. This could look like an accident and actually accidently
occurred in 2007.

As far as kinetic weapons in space are concerned, machine guns are
generally problematic due to the recoil involved. If the weapon is fired
at any angle which is not in the exact direction of the orbital path the
satellite is travelling along, then a torque will be applied, rapidly
changing the direction of it. The idea of kinetic weapons has been
attempted before. The Soviet space station Salyut-3, for example, was
armed with a rapid fire cannon in the mid 1970s.

**[Lasers]{.underline}** are also being considered as defensive weapons,
with the idea being to take out attacking satellites\' solar panels.
[With no power]{.underline}, the [satellite will be **unable** to
**communicate**]{.underline} with the ground station and is essentially
lost. The [**recoil** from a laser is **much smaller** and the lack of
atmosphere]{.underline} would [allow them to perform **better** than on
the Earth\'s surface]{.underline}.

A [laser could be used to blind instrumentation on an opposing
satellite]{.underline} thereby [reducing the efficacy of either
**rendezvous** or **aiming software**]{.underline}.

The [most likely satellites to be targeted would be those dedicated to
**communication** or **observing**]{.underline}. With the newest
research satellites able to take images down to a 30cm resolution,
military versions are likely to be even better. A nation with no
communication facilities or ability to observe others will never know
who has launched an attack against them.

But what would a space war look like from Earth? While sci-fi films have
conditioned us to believe that space lasers would use visible light,
shorter wavelengths actually produce more power. Any observers on the
surface would be unlikely to directly see any effects from space
warfare, unless a kinetic kill actually breaks a spacecraft up---with
debris lighting up as it re-enters the atmosphere. That said, attacks
could still affect our lives on Earth, disturbing GPS, television
services and even cash withdrawals.

Nuclear weapons?

The use of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in space is
currently banned under the Outer Space Treaty and the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty. But not all nuclear armed nations have ratified
the latter, including the US and North Korea.

A small number of nuclear tests in space were conducted in the 1960s
including Starfish Prime. These resulted in artificial radiation belts
forming around the Earth which were still detectable decades after the
event---posing a danger for astronauts.

These **[radiation belts]{.underline}** also [disabled half a dozen
satellites in]{.underline} **[l]{.underline}**ow **[E]{.underline}**arth
**[o]{.underline}**rbit. If the results of Starfish Prime are anything
to go by, then [clearly it would take only a **handful** of nuclear
detonations to make space **unusable**]{.underline} for any satellites
for decades to come.

[It would be easy to become pessimistic about Arctic military stability;
we are not]{.underline}. [International [conflict]{.mark} in the region
is [unlikely because]{.mark} **the Arctic [nations]{.mark} are
[committed to]{.mark} a [rules-based approach]{.mark} to
security**.]{.underline} [Worries]{.underline} [about the potential for
conflict]{.underline} over seabed rights in the Arctic [are
misplaced.]{.underline}6 **[War is far less likely above the Arctic
Circle than in nearly any other part of the world.]{.underline}**7
[[Cooperation]{.mark} is breaking out [everywhere]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}; international law is followed; there is no
political vacuum.8 [While elsewhere Russia is exhibiting its propensity
toward military displays, in the Arctic, Russia is playing a
constructive role in maintaining regional stability]{.underline}.
[[Russia]{.mark} is intently [focused on regional security]{.mark} in
part because it sees in the Arctic an opportunity [to]{.mark}
[recapture]{.mark} the former [influence]{.mark} and superpower standing
that it enjoyed during the Cold War]{.underline}. Russia strategically
and successfully takes advantage of its dominant geographic posi- tion
surrounding 170 degrees of the Arctic Circle, and its energy and
economic presence in the region dwarfs that of all other Arctic states
combined. [The United States and Russia enjoy a **pragmatic working
relationship** in managing the security of the Bering
Strait]{.underline}.9 [The U.S. Coast Guard and Russian Border Patrol
have cooperated for nearly two decades under a bilateral treaty to
manage safety and security in the 53-mile-wide strait]{.underline}.10
[The neighbors also jointly led negotiations among all eight Arctic
states to adopt binding agreements on search and rescue and oil spill
preparedness and response]{.underline}. Now the United States and Russia
are leading efforts to adopt agreements on marine pol- lution prevention
and marine scientific research in the region. [The
[**remoteness**]{.mark} and **physical isolation** of the Arctic region
also [reduces]{.mark} military [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Arctic
states find comfort in their exclusive and shared geogra-
phy]{.underline}. [They are united to resist efforts from outside the
region that might erode,]{.underline} let alone upend, [the contemporary
order]{.underline}. The one thing all Arctic states have in common is a
rather circumspect view of states from outside the region that seek to
play a greater role in the Arctic. Furthermore[, all Arctic
[states]{.mark} are [invested in a rules-based approach]{.mark} to
stability and security,]{.underline} based principally on the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).[11 The
consensus]{.underline} among Arctic states that UNCLOS [is the framework
for distribution of rights and duties in the region minimizes risk of
conflict over maritime boundaries. Every Arctic nation is a party to the
treaty except the United States, which]{.underline}, since 1983, [has
made a commitment to adhere to most provi- sions of the
treaty]{.underline}.12 [Finally, the likelihood of [conflict]{.mark}
breaking out over the region's vast offshore resources is also [remote
since Arctic states are pursuing]{.mark} their [maritime claims
through]{.mark} the]{.underline} multilateral Commission on the Limits
of the Continental Shelf ([[CLCS]{.underline}]{.mark}), an independent
international technical body estab- lished by UNCLOS. [Every Arctic
coastal state except the United States has submitted at least partial
information for consideration of a claim to sovereign rights over seabed
riches of oil, gas and minerals]{.underline}. To the extent that
overlapping maritime claims exist, the four other Arctic Ocean coastal
states, including Russia, are proceeding with deliberate professionalism
in appropriate bilateral forums and with the CLCS to resolve them.13 I[n
2010, Russia and Norway, for example, signed a treaty to resolve their
40-year disagreement over maritime resource boundaries in the Barents
Sea]{.underline}. More recently, Denmark and Canada established maritime
delimitation in the Lincoln Sea, north- west of Greenland. Similarly,
Canada and the United States are exploring a way ahead to resolve a
benign disagreement over a single boundary line in the Beaufort Sea.

A Battle for Resources?

[Most of the resources in the Arctic are to be found in countries within
**territorial seas** or **exclusive economic zones**]{.underline}.
[Since all the Arctic States have pledged to respect UNCLOS]{.underline}
in the Illulissat Declaration, [[there is **very little chance of
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The principle of precaution seems to be
the reason explaining the disputes about the delimitation of the
extended continental shelves, in case something would be found even if
it is unlikely. [Some feared that [a]{.mark} "**[resources driven
conflict]{.mark}**" would occur]{.underline} in the Circumpolar North
after the outbreak of the Ukrainian Crisis; [the phenomenon [did **not
occur**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reason is that [for its own
development, [Moscow **needs the region to remain
peaceful**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Käpylä & Mikkola 2015;
Rahbek-Clemmensen 2015). Given Gazprom's earlier decision to involve the
Norwegian StatoilHydro in the development phase of its Arctic Shtokman
gas field, it can even be argued that [Russia will **need to cooperate**
with its Arctic neighbours to develop its Arctic resources
successfully]{.underline}.

Currently, the main producer of petroleum in the Arctic is Russia, where
the offshore Prirazlomnoye field in the Pechora Sea is operated by
Gazprom Neft. This field, which began commercial production in 2013, had
an output of 2.1 million tons of Arctic oil in 2016. In March 2016, the
Goliat field in Norway, a joint venture between Eni and Statoil, started
production of Arctic oil. This field will produce 100,000 barrels of oil
per day. With regards to natural gas, the Snøhvit gas field operated by
Statoil represents the first and primary offshore development in the
Arctic Barents Sea. The giant Russian natural gas field of Shtokman has
dealt with several setbacks mostly from technological challenges, cost
overruns and low gas prices. The cooperation agreement with European
partners Total and Statoil expired in 2012 and further project
development and production start is delayed until further notice.
Another major Arctic Russian natural gas field, Yamal, has experienced
similar setbacks in development. However, as of April 2014, the field
operated by Novatek plans to start producing gas condensate.

In the North American Arctic, increased Arctic natural gas production
can become a reality with the proposed investments in the 'Alaska
Pipeline Project' through a consortium involving ExxonMobil,
ConocoPhillips, BP and TransCanada. This major infrastructure project
would make it possible to transport the natural gas in Alaska's large
Arctic reserves to markets in Canada and the United States. However, the
planned continuation of this high investment project depends for a large
part on high oil and gas prices. A prolonged period of low oil and gas
prices could lead to a delay of the project which is proposed to begin
transporting natural gas by 2025. The largest oil field in the American
Arctic, in Prudhoe Bay, already reached peak production more than two
decades ago. A second field in the Alaskan Arctic is the 'Alpine field',
developed by ConocoPhillips and which has produced oil since 2000. The
extent to which new production fields are to be developed in the Arctic
is to a large extent dependent on a recovery of oil prices and domestic
policies making a trade-off between environmental objections and the
benefits of domestic resource production. In 2015, Royal Dutch Shell,
one of the major players in the American Arctic, decided to abandon its
drilling operations in the Arctic amid sustained low oil prices and
rising pressure about environmental consequences. In October 2016, a
large oil discovery was made in the Alaskan Arctic by Caelus Energy.
This project, expected to start producing oil by 2022, could potentially
offset some of the production declines from the other Arctic oil fields.

In Greenland, oil and gas development is a potential road towards full
independence from the Kingdom of Denmark. To that purpose, a national
oil company, Nunaoil, has been established; it has an automatic 12.5
percent stake in new oil exploration projects and an option to become a
shareholder in oil projects which move to the development phase. Among
the companies which have actively engaged in exploration activities in
the Greenlandic Arctic are ExxonMobil, Chevron, Statoil, Husky Energy
and Cairn Energy. However, also in Greenland, the drop in the oil price
in 2014 has had a large effect on prospective Arctic oil exploration
activities. Total petroleum prospecting, exploration and exploitation
licences (in force) have decreased from nine in 2014 to three in 2015
and zero in 2016 (Mineral Licence and Safety Authority, 2017). The
Scottish energy company Cairns Energy, one of the major players in
Greenland's petroleum exploration, is evaluating its Greenlandic
portfolio as no commercial oil players have been found yet. In 2014,
Statoil decided not to extend three of its four Greenlandic exploration
licences.

[Asian emerging powers have expressed their interest in Arctic
resources]{.underline}. However, [their contribution to Arctic economic
development **remains modest**]{.underline}. China, Japan and South
Korea are investing in resources exploration in Greenland (Tonami,
2016). Both [China and Japan have expressed their will to cooperate with
Russian companies]{.underline} and have also expressed their will to
invest in the Yamal's liquified natural gas exploitation. However, [the
discussions are advancing at a **really slow pace**]{.underline}.
(Pollmann, 2016; Sorensen and Klimenko, 2017).

Arctic Militarisation?

If we analysed the numbers provided by the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (Wezeman, October 16), we can see that Russia is
leading in terms of air and sea capacities, while Canada has the
strongest land capabilities but strongly lacks specific Arctic
capacities such as icebreakers.

It is interesting to draw a comparison between the current military
activities and the Cold War to get some more insight about what happens
today in the Arctic. The numbers gathered by Lassi Heininen, Alexander
Sergunin and Gleb Yarovoy:

If one observes the data closely, one can draw the following conclusion:

USSR's presence in the 80s outnumbers the current Russian presence. The
same can be said for the US.

NATO has more submarines, lager ships and aircraft that are Arctic
capable than Russia. The mention "Arctic capable" is important; these
forces can be elsewhere and are not permanently stationed in the region.
Russia, thus, remains the strongest Arctic power.

[Although there is a military presence, we cannot speak about a military
theatre like the region has witnessed during the **Cold
War**.]{.underline} The reason behind the Russian military presence in
the region is threefold: 1) to assert Moscow's sovereignty over the
region 2) to protect the Russian companies operating in the region and
3) to show the entire world that Russia is still an Arctic power. Thus,
the [[Russian military presence in the region is tied to]{.mark}
**prestige**, [**economics** and **energy
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike, the Cold War, the logic is
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} grounded in a [**[bloc-to-bloc
conflicts]{.mark}** and **deterrence**]{.underline} (Heininen et al.,
2014).

A few [scholars have used the expression]{.underline} "**[Arctic
exceptionalism]{.underline}**" [to speak about the lack of
conflict]{.underline} in the Arctic. According to them, [[the]{.mark}
Arctic's current [stability is explained by the **lack of resources in
contested areas**]{.mark} or in the high seas]{.underline}3 [[and the
capacity of]{.mark} **regional fora**, such as [the **Arctic Council**,
to **defuse tension**]{.mark}]{.underline}4 (Käpylä and Mikkola, 2016).

[The Red Planet is a **cold**]{.underline}, **[dead
place]{.underline}**, [with an atmosphere]{.underline} about [**100
times thinner** than Earth's]{.underline}. The paltry amount of air that
does exist on [[Mars]{.underline}]{.mark} is primarily composed of
noxious carbon dioxide, which [[does]{.mark} [little to
**protect**]{.mark}]{.underline} the surface [[from]{.mark} the
**[Sun's]{.mark}** harmful **[rays]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Air pressure
on Mars is very low; at 600 Pascals, it's only about 0.6 percent that of
Earth. You might as well be exposed to the vacuum of space, [resulting
in]{.underline} a severe form of the bends---including ruptured lungs,
dangerously swollen skin and body tissue, and ultimately
**[death]{.underline}**. The thin atmosphere also means that heat cannot
be retained at the surface. The average temperature on Mars is -81
degrees Fahrenheit (-63 degrees Celsius), with temperatures dropping as
low as -195 degrees F (-126 degrees C). By contrast, the coldest
temperature ever recorded on Earth was at Vostok Station in Antarctica,
at -128 degrees F (-89 degrees C) on June 23, 1982. Once temperatures
get below the -40 degrees F/C mark, people who aren't properly dressed
for the occasion can expect hypothermia to set in within about five to
seven minutes. Mars also has less mass than is typically appreciated.
Gravity on the Red Planet is 0.375 that of Earth's, which means a
180-pound person on Earth would weigh a scant 68 pounds on Mars. While
that might sound appealing, [this [low-gravity]{.mark}]{.underline}
[environment would]{.underline} likely [[wreak **havoc** to]{.mark}
human health]{.underline} in the long term, [and]{.underline} possibly
have negative impacts on human **[[fertility]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Yet
despite these and a plethora of other issues, there's this popular idea
floating around that we'll soon be able to set up colonies on Mars with
ease. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is projecting colonies on Mars as early as
the 2050s, while astrobiologist Lewis Darnell, a professor at the
University of Westminster, has offered a more modest estimate, saying
it'll be about 50 to 100 years before "substantial numbers of people
have moved to Mars to live in self-sustaining towns." The United Arab
Emirates is aiming to build a Martian city of 600,000 occupants by 2117,
in one of the more ambitious visions of the future. Sadly, this is
literally science fiction. While there's no doubt in my mind that humans
will eventually visit Mars and even build a base or two, [the notion
that we'll soon set up colonies inhabited by]{.underline} hundreds or
[thousands of people is pure **nonsense**]{.underline}, and an
unmitigated denial of the tremendous challenges posed by such a
prospect. Pioneering astronautics engineer Louis Friedman, co-founder of
the Planetary Society and author of Human Spaceflight: From Mars to the
Stars, likens this unfounded enthusiasm to the unfulfilled visions
proposed during the 1940s and 1950s. "Back then, cover stories of
magazines like Popular Mechanics and Popular Science showed colonies
under the oceans and in the Antarctic," Friedman told Gizmodo. The
feeling was that humans would find a way to occupy every nook and cranny
of the planet, no matter how challenging or inhospitable, he said. "But
this just hasn't happened. We make occasional visits to Antarctica and
we even have some bases there, but that's about it. Under the oceans
it's even worse, with some limited human operations, but in reality it's
really very, very little." As for human colonies in either of these
environments, not so much. In fact, not at all, despite the relative
ease at which we could achieve this. After the Moon landings, Friedman
said he and his colleagues were hugely optimistic about the future,
believing "we would do more and more things, such as place colonies on
Mars and the Moon," but the "fact is, [[no]{.underline}]{.mark} human
[spaceflight **[program]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whether Apollo, the
Space Shuttle Program, or the International Space Station," [has
[established]{.mark} the]{.underline} necessary
**[[groundwork]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for setting up
colonies]{.underline} on Mars, [such as building the required
**[infra]{.mark}structure**]{.underline}, [finding **[safe]{.mark}** and
**viable [ways]{.mark}** [of **sourcing food**]{.mark} and
**water**]{.underline}, [[mitigating]{.underline}]{.mark} the
deleterious effects of [**[radiation]{.mark}** and **low
gravity**]{.underline}, among other issues. Unlike other fields,
development into human spaceflight, he said, "has become static."
Friedman agreed that we'll likely build bases on Mars, but the "evidence
of [history]{.underline}" [suggests]{.underline}
[colonization]{.underline} [is **unlikely**]{.underline} for the
foreseeable future. Neuroscientist Rachael Seidler from the University
of Florida says many people today fail to appreciate how difficult it'll
be to sustain colonies on the Red Planet. "People like to be optimistic
about the idea of colonizing Mars," Seidler, a specialist in motor
learning and the effects of microgravity on astronauts, told Gizmodo.
"But it also sounds a bit pie-in-the-sky," she said. "A lot of people
approach it as thinking we shouldn't limit ourselves based on
practicalities, but I agree, [there are a lot of]{.underline} potential
[negative physiological **consequences**]{.underline}." Seidler said
NASA and other space agencies are currently working very hard to create
and test countermeasures for the various negative impacts of living on
Mars. For example, astronauts on the ISS, who are subject to tremendous
muscle and bone loss, try to counteract the effects by doing strength
and aerobic training while up in space. As for treating the resulting
negative health impacts, whether caused by long-duration stays on the
ISS or from long-term living in the low-gravity environment of Mars,
"we're not there yet," said Seidler. In his latest book, On the Future:
Prospects for Humanity, cosmologist and astrophysicist Martin Rees
addressed the issue of colonizing Mars rather succinctly: [By
2100]{.underline} thrill seekers\... [may have established]{.underline}
'[bases']{.underline} [independent from]{.underline} the
[Earth]{.underline}---on Mars, or maybe on asteroids. Elon Musk (born in
1971) of SpaceX says he wants to die on Mars---but not on impact. [But
don't ever expect mass **emigration**]{.underline} from Earth. And here
I disagree strongly with Musk and with my late Cambridge colleague
Stephen Hawking, who enthuse about rapid build-up of large-scale Martian
communities. It's a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an
escape from Earth's problems. We've got to solve these problems here.
[Coping with climate change may seem daunting]{.underline}, [but
it's]{.underline} a [doddle]{.underline} [compared]{.underline} [to
**terraforming Mars**]{.underline}. No place in our solar system offers
an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest.
[There's no '**Planet B**' for ordinary]{.underline} risk-averse
[people]{.underline}. Indeed, [there's the whole terraforming
issue]{.underline} to consider. By terraforming, scientists are
referring to the hypothetical prospect of [[**geoengineering**]{.mark} a
planet to make it habitable]{.underline} for humans and other life. For
Mars, that [would [mean]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[injection of]{.mark}
**oxygen** and]{.underline} other [**[gases]{.mark}** into the
atmosphere]{.underline} to raise surface temperature and air pressure,
among other interventions. A common argument in favor of colonizing Mars
is that it'll allow us [[to]{.mark} begin the process of
[transform]{.mark}ing the [planet to]{.mark} a **[habitable]{.mark}
state**]{.underline}. This scenario has been tackled by a number of
science fiction authors, including Kim Stanley Robinson in his acclaimed
Mars Trilogy. But as Friedman told Gizmodo, "that's thousands of years
in the making at least." Briony Horgan, assistant professor of planetary
science at Purdue University, said Martian [terraforming is a
**pipedream**]{.underline}, a prospect that's "[way beyond any kind of
**technology** we're going to have **any time soon**]{.underline}," she
told Gizmodo. When it comes to terraforming Mars, there's also the
logistics to consider, and the materials available to the geoengineers
who would dare to embark upon such a multi-generational project. In
their 2018 Nature paper, Bruce Jakosky and Christopher Edwards from the
University of Colorado, Boulder sought to understand how much carbon
dioxide would be needed to increase the air pressure on Mars to the
point where humans could work on the surface without having to wear
pressure suits, and to increase temperature such that liquid water could
exist and persist on the surface. Jakosky and Edwards concluded that
[there's [not]{.mark}]{.underline} nearly [[enough CO2]{.mark} on Mars
required for **terraforming**]{.underline}, and that future geoengineers
would have to somehow import the required gases to do so.

Settlement of Mars---is it a dream or a necessity? [From scientific
publications to public forms, there is certainly [little]{.mark}
[consensus on whether colonization]{.mark} of Mars [is]{.mark}
**necessary** or even **[possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with a rich
diversity of opinions that range from categorical It is a necessity!20
to equally categorical Should Humans Colonize Other Planets? No.21 A
strong proponent of the idea, [Orwig puts forward five reasons for Mars
colonization, implicitly stating that establishing a permanent colony of
humans on Mars is no longer an option but a real
necessity]{.underline}.20 Specifically, [these arguments
are]{.underline}: **[Survival of humans as a species]{.underline}**;
Exploring the potential of life on Mars to sustain humans; Using space
technology to positively contribute to our quality of life, from health
to minimizing and reversing negative aspects of anthropogenic activity
of humans on Earth; Developing as a species; Gaining political and
economic leadership. [The first argument captures the essence of what
most space colonization proponents feel---our ever growing environmental
footprint threatens the survival of human race on]{.underline}
[Earth]{.underline}. Indeed, a large body of evidence points to human
activity as the main cause of extinction of many species, with shrinking
biodiversity and depleting resources threatening the very survival of
humans on this planet. [Colonization of other planets could potentially
increase the probability of our survival.]{.underline} While being at
the core of such ambitious projects as Mars One, [a **self‐sustained
[colony]{.mark} of any size**]{.underline} on Mars **[[is hardly
feasible]{.mark} in the foreseeable future]{.underline}**. Indeed,
[[sustaining]{.mark} even a **small number**]{.underline} [of [colonists
would require]{.mark} a **[continuous supply of]{.mark} food, oxygen,
water and [basic materials]{.mark}**. At this stage, [it is not
clear]{.mark} whether [it would be possible to establish]{.mark} a
system that would generate [these resources]{.mark} **locally**, or
whether it would at least in part rely on the **delivery** of these
resources]{.underline} ([or]{.underline} **[essential
components]{.underline}** [necessary for their local production) [from
**Earth**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Beyond the supply of these very basic
resources, [it would be]{.mark} quite challenging if not
[impossible]{.mark} for the colonists [to]{.mark} independently
[produce]{.mark} **hi‐tech but vitally [important
assets]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[such as medicines, electronics and
robotics]{.mark} systems, or advanced materials that provide us with a
decent **quality of life**. In this case, would their existence become
little more than the **jogtrot of life**, as compared with the standards
expected at the Earth]{.underline}?22

Worries about refuges [To be refuges where humans can survive
catastrophe on Earth, [colonies]{.mark} on other planets [must]{.mark}
of course contain and **sustain humans**]{.underline}. That is the
point. They must [also [be highly
**technological**]{.mark}]{.underline}: surviving in an environment less
hospitable than anywhere on Earth would need powerful resources. Mars
does not have an atmosphere that we can breathe, does not support plants
that we can eat, is very cold, has little usable water, and receives
much less solar energy. It is hard to make an analogy with anywhere on
Earth: combine the light levels of the deep ocean with the cold of the
Antarctic, add radiation, and then exaggerate. (The pictures from the
Martian Rovers are accurate as far as colour and illumination go, but we
tend to project familiarity onto them, taking the atmosphere to be like
air on Earth and reading the absence of snow and ice as warmth rather
than the frozen desert that it really is. I know this is my own tendency
until I catch myself.) [[The colony must]{.mark} from early on [produce
all its own food, water, and oxygen]{.mark}. [This is not]{.mark} at all
[impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}, given sophisticated equipment, which
has been tried out under desert and arctic conditions [[on **Earth**.
But these conditions are **not really** ]{.mark}**that much [like
Mars]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [especially with respect to cold,
dark, and radiation. The [equipment must]{.mark} continue to [function,
**indefinitely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So [[it must be possible to
**repair**]{.mark} it [**without** using supplies]{.mark} brought [from
Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}. So, [until]{.underline} **[local
manufacturing]{.underline}** [can take over, [repair equipment]{.mark}
and spare parts [must be]{.mark} added to the list of things that must
be [sent **with the colonists**]{.mark} **in the first
place**]{.underline}. And, [easy to overlook, [it adds to the **number
of people** who must be sent]{.mark}. A modern technological society of
a kind that can create and repair the kind of equipment we are talking
about involves thousands of **specialized skills**]{.underline}. Some
combinations of these can be compressed into a smaller number of people,
but many are still needed. **[Robinson Crusoe would not last long on
Mars]{.underline}**. [Questions about the number of people in a colony
are crucial. [Selfsufficiency requires a **large
number**]{.mark}]{.underline} of people -- say several hundred at the
least. [And]{.underline} [**[long-term survival]{.underline}**
[requires]{.underline} **[genetic diversity]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [If
population sizes are too small, then inbreeding makes **hereditary
defects** and infectious **diseases** more **common**]{.underline}.
[Moreover, with a small population size, random fluctuations can result
in imbalanced numbers of males and females, leading to both a smaller
number in the following generation and yet more reduced
diversity]{.underline}. (A shortage of females is obviously more
serious. A bias towards females would have obvious advantages. Perhaps
in fact an ideal colony should be all female plus a genetically diverse
sperm bank.) It has been estimated that in wild quadrupeds a population
size of 500 to 1,000 is needed for long-term survival of a species,
while the crews for the simulated Mars habitats on Earth have typically
had six people! [Humans **already** have a very low genetic
diversity]{.underline}: pairs of chimpanzees in the same troops have on
average more genetic diversity than pairs of humans on Earth. The crews
would have to be carefully chosen. A very special psychological makeup
is needed. Crew members must endure close quarters with a small number
of others, a very basic life, the knowledge that one has left one\'s
family and friends behind, and a high risk of death. They must also be
chosen so that there is a range of technical knowledge, improvisational
skills, and the emotional and cultural makeup needed for something like
Earth civilization to continue. And this must reproduce itself for
generations. It is unlikely that, even if an optimum mix of people were
achieved in the initial crew, the same mix would be preserved in
subsequent generations. This too argues for larger population sizes. But
the more people there are, the greater the expense and resources needed
to establish the colony in the first place. A disturbing fact about the
production of food on Mars has recently emerged. [The [soil on Mars
is]{.mark} rich in compounds called perchlorates. They react with
ultraviolet light, to which the **Martian atmosphere** is largely
**transparent**, in a way that is **[fatal to many
cells]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [There is]{.underline}]{.mark} [thus a
lot of [doubt]{.mark} whether **[plant crops]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
the symbiotic bacteria that many of them need,
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in
Martian soil. This complicates ambitions for indoor farming
considerably.]{.underline} Because of the effects on both living cells
and human health, **[[perchlorate]{.underline}]{.mark}** contamination
is regarded as pollution on Earth. Perchlorates also [[have a risk of

heated]{.underline}, [[complicating plans to produce **oxygen**]{.mark}
by heating the Martian soil]{.underline}. They are, however, a source of
oxygen and of other basic chemicals; although dangerous they could have
their uses. There are surely high-tech solutions to this problem, but
equally surely they raise the stakes for transport and technology and
increase the danger. The complexity of technological society [There is a
fundamental fact behind many of these problems: the large **scale** and
**interdependence of our society**]{.underline}, with its complex web of
manufacturing techniques and expertise held in the minds of many people.
It [is]{.underline} **[extremely hard to duplicate]{.underline}** this
in a small population with restricted resources, especially [in a
hostile and unfamiliar environment]{.underline}. So [[dependence on the
**mother culture** is **hard to avoid**]{.underline}]{.mark}. (This was
true in the past, also. The early European colonies in North America did
not make their own muskets until they had grown quite large, and
European agricultural styles took a lot of adapting. This may not seem
advanced technology. But could you make a musket? For that matter, could
you make a stone axe?) This means that [the [high-tech]{.mark} [devices
needed]{.mark} to survive in the Martian environment [are **not going to
be designed there**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The designs are going to come
from home. And it is likely that at least a proportion of the devices
themselves will also. 3D printing from transmitted designs may solve
some problems, though, if the raw materials can be obtained and refined
on Mars. (I would imagine that supplies of direct and indirect
biological material, such as the petroleum and oil products that are
used to make plastics, might pose a serious problem.) [If imported
equipment is unsuitable or does not work because of some unexpected
**quirk**]{.underline} of the faraway environment, [much of it will have
to be **redesigned**]{.underline} and manufactured not where it is
needed but where the techniques and expertise are to be found. [The more
advanced the apparatus (the higher the tech), the more will need to be
**transported** to the colony]{.underline}, adding to the transport
costs and creating a need for spares. For all these reasons **[[I am
extremely sceptical that a colony of the size that we could send to Mars
in the next]{.mark} decades, perhaps in the next [century, could sustain
itself without frequent supplies and reinforcements from
Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [The obvious reply to this is to
drop the requirement that the colony be able to survive
without]{.underline} the supplies and [reinforcements. But this
would]{.underline} **[undercut]{.underline}** one of [the]{.underline}
**[main purpose]{.underline}**s -- that of [providing a remnant of
humanity on Mars with a reasonable chance of **surviving an earthly
catastrophe**]{.underline}. The colony would then be a scientific
expedition and the beginning of a preparatory project that might take
centuries.

system, hearing and eyesight are also significant and related to the
physiological adaptation/stress to microgravity (Cassady et al., 2016;
Ertl et al., 2002; Strewe et al., 2012). The life-supporting environment
of a Martian colony won't facilitate astronaut recovery to a necessary
healthy status, and is likely to require the most of astronauts'
physical capacities. Mars gravity is 0.38g (Lacquaniti et al., 2017),
which indicates that [[astronauts]{.mark} will [remain in hypogravity
for the whole mission]{.mark}, or lifetime]{.underline}. [Without the
opportunity to return to an environment]{.underline} at 1 g (Earth
gravity), we assume that most [[astronauts will **never

have to adapt to new parameters of health and well-being, as made
possible in the Mars colony infrastructures. Moreover,
[[astronauts]{.mark} will have to tolerate **lower oxygen
tension**]{.underline} (Fogg 1995) and the [[risk]{.mark} of chronic
[exposure to **radiation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. NASA's human habitats
on Mars are being designed to prevent or mitigate most of the health
hazards associated with long-duration missions, and are invested with
new technologies for health monitoring and diagnostics, in association
with exercise systems (NASA's Journey to Mars -- Pioneering Next Steps
in Space Exploration, 2015). Other governmental and private enterprises
have not detailed their efforts to maintain a healthy environment for
astronauts, and have focused on the primordial aspect of transporting
the first colonizers to Mars and providing a minimal environment
compatible with human life. Overall, it is unknown how pregnancy would
be influenced by microgravity symptoms, for better or worse.

This [**dark scenario** of solar **space expansion** produced
by]{.underline} the [[application of **geopolitical theory** has
profound implications]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the argument that
[colonization]{.mark} of other bodies in the solar system is necessary
to **alleviate** or escape the **formidable catastrophic** and
**existential risks** facing **Earth-bound humanity**]{.underline}. Both
riskologists and space expansionists strongly believe, with Hawking,
that "once we establish independent colonies, our entire future will be
safe."25 If all humanity's eggs are in one fraying and vulnerable
basket, then it stands to reason that spreading viable colonies of
humans to other celestial bodies will help ensure the survival of the
human species. [While the role of existing space capabilities in
amplifying the]{.underline} (p.357) [dangers of the great technogenic
threat of nuclear war belies the astro-optimism of space advocates, what
of their cherished larger vision of making humanity a multiworld
species]{.underline}? While [space advocates]{.underline} propose a
variety of ways space expansion might alleviate or escape existing
risks, they [give]{.underline} almost [no attention to whether expansion
might generate **new risks** or help **re-activate already regulated
ones**]{.underline}. The list of major threats facing humanity is
dauntingly long, and the expansionist agenda for solar space has many
parts, making assessment a complex undertaking. But there are **[[six
major ways]{.underline}]{.mark}** in which the realization of the
[[space expansion]{.mark}ist agenda for solar orbital space is likely to
**[generate]{.mark}**]{.underline} or activate [**[catastrophic
and]{.mark} e[x]{.mark}istential [risks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Taken in
combination these arguments provide a strong basis for putting ambitious
space expansion on the list of megathreats potentially confronting
humanity, and for making every effort to relinquish it. [Large-scale
space expansion must be viewed as something [akin to a full-scale
**nuclear war**]{.mark} and assiduously avoided. Unlike many of the
other threats humanity faces, addressing those created by ambitious
space expansion is now extremely simple: **just say no**]{.underline}.

The realization of the space expansionist program for solar orbital
space enlarges the probability and scope of catastrophic and existential
risks confronting humanity in six ways: male!c geopolitics, natural
threat ampli!cation, restraint reversal, hierarchy enablement, alien
generation, and monster multiplication (see Table 10.3).

First, arge-scale solar [space expansion]{.underline} will [produce a
radically novel political and material landscape that is extremely
inauspicious for **security**]{.underline}, freedom, [and **human
survival**]{.underline}, a perfect storm of unfavorable possibilities
and tendencies. With a new word for a new phenomenon, borrowed from
astrology for a conjunction of negatives, solar space patterns can be
characterized as geopolitically malefic. Just as [the [space]{.mark}
environment creates terrestrially inconceivable extremes of frigid and
torrid temperatures on opposite sides of the same object]{.underline},
so too the prospective solar landscape combines geopolitical extremes in
ways unknown to terrestrial experience. Most ominously, solar space
geopolitics combines the extreme diversities and high effective
distances experienced on Archipelago Earth with system-wide levels of
intense violence interdependence found on Planetary Earth. [Polities
will be extremely different and spatiotemporally remote but will be
[capable]{.mark} of readily inflicting **[massive levels of
destruction]{.mark}** on one another. [Add]{.mark} shifting
[distribution, wide accessibility, and low distinctiveness]{.mark}, and
the contours of the violence-material [landscape becomes **even more
prone** to **large-scale destruction**]{.mark}. With system-wide common
government and mutual restraints very difficult to **create** and
**sustain**, solar [space]{.mark} [comes]{.mark} close [to]{.mark}
[be]{.mark}ing **[maximally suboptimal for positive outcomes]{.mark}**,
a nightmarish worst of all possible worlds in **geopolitical
conjunction**.]{.underline} Extensive mutual restraints will be vitally
necessary, but they will be nearly impossible to realize. While
humanity's (p.358) eggs might be scattered among many baskets,
egg-smashing with large rocks will be easy---and likely.

Facing this extensive list of major factors disposing the system toward
large-scale violent conflict in solar space will require humanity's
transmutation into Tsiolkovskian angels to avoid catastrophic and
existentially threatening warfare. Perhaps the only saving grace of this
key conclusion of geopolitical analysis is that the demons loosened by
opening the Pandora's box of space colonization might start to wreak
their damage early enough to throttle the colonial enterprise before it
gets too fatally under way.

[A [second]{.mark} way]{.underline} in which colonizing solar space
poses catastrophic and existential threats [[is]{.mark} through
**[natural threat amplification]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Because
[[**asteroids** and **comets** collide with]{.mark} [the
Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [the **[total energy]{.mark}** contained
within the population of near-Earth objects **[vastly exceeds]{.mark}**
that contained in all **nuclear arsenals**, they pose the inevitable
prospect of **terrestrial calamities**]{.underline}. The rate at which
these objects strike the Earth is now solely a function of natural
forces. Space [expansionists advance human movement into space to
**avert** this threat and promote their]{.underline} (p.359) [solution
to this problem as a principal space contribution to **reducing**
catastrophic and existential threats]{.underline}. But because the
technologies to divert away from the Earth are essentially identical to
those needed to direct objects toward the Earth, [the rate at which
these objects strike the Earth could **increase** if they become
**instruments of interstate rivalry** and become **weaponized** as
**planetoid bombs**]{.underline}. This prospect leads Sagan to recommend
delaying the full mapping of asteroid orbits and development of
diversion techniques until after some form of effective world government
has been established on Earth. But with the [[spread of
colonies]{.underline}]{.mark} across the solar system, the [writ of any
government on Earth will be severely limited]{.underline}. The same
anarchical political configurations that Sagan views as incompatible
with security from intentional asteroid bombardment on Earth will almost
certainly be reproduced on a vastly larger, and more severe, scale in
the Solar Archipelago. If, as seems extremely likely, systemic anarchy
returns with the diaspora of humans across the solar system, [then
militarized rivalries are very [likely to ensue]{.mark}, producing
[asteroidal weaponization]{.mark}. If this happens, a natural threat
will have been amplified, enlarging the potential for the occurrence of
a catastrophic event.]{.underline}

The [[third way]{.underline}]{.mark} in which ambitious space expansion
could increase the catastrophic and existential risks confronting
humanity [[is]{.mark} through **[restraint
reversal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Barring civilizational collapse, the
cornucopia of [technological [innovation]{.mark} will [continue to
**pour**]{.mark} **forth** its prodigies]{.underline}. If the
monstrosities and menaces of the ever-widening technological cone of
possibility can be thwarted only by staying within a narrow path of
human preservation and enhancement, [then space expansion must be
assessed for its effects on the reversals, regulations, and
relinquishments constituting the barriers of restraint]{.underline}. The
record with nuclear weapons demonstrates that institutional
architectures of restraint are not easy to erect and sustain on Earth.
If space expansion makes the creation and preservation of restraints
even more difficult, the probability of otherwise unrelated catastrophic
and existential outcomes will rise, making it a potent **[[catalyst for
multisided disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Instead of mitigating the
effects of multiple catastrophic and existential risks, [large-scale
space expansion promises to **multiply them**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There are many reasons to anticipate that restraints established on
Earth will be reversed if space colonization occurs. [[Restraints are
**unlikely to survive**]{.mark} transplantation into diverse and
demanding off-world environments. If humans are living on multiple
worlds subject to different governments]{.underline}, regulation and
relinquishment will be [more difficult to establish, there will be more
places for potential breakdowns]{.underline}, and verification of
[[compliance]{.mark} will be **vastly more [difficult]{.mark}**.
If]{.underline}, as seems extremely likely, [the many different
worlds]{.underline} in the Solar Archipelago in systemic anarchy [have
violently hostile relations, establishing and sustaining restraints will
become nearly impossible. Surveillance in]{.underline} the vast reaches
of solar [space will be vastly difficult. And if the human species
radiates into multiple]{.underline} (p.360) [species, the barriers to
regulation and relinquishment will become even more
formidable.]{.underline}

A [particularly **dangerous case**]{.underline} of restraint reversal
[may be]{.underline} technologies leading to [**a**rtificial
super**i**ntelligence]{.underline}, a particularly potent technogenic
threat. [[Space activities are]{.mark} already heavily [dependent
on]{.mark} advanced **[computing]{.mark}**]{.underline} and robotic
technologies, and peoples living in space are likely to be far more
cyber-dependent than those on Earth. [Living in harshly inhospitable
environments, spacekind will have strong incentives to [push]{.mark} the
[development of **cybernetic**]{.mark} **capabilities**.]{.underline} If
a robust regime for the restraint and relinquishment of ASI is not
established, [human [extinction]{.mark} might [occur before]{.mark}
significant space [colonization]{.mark} occurs]{.underline}. If an
effective ASI-restraint regime is developed on Earth before extensive
space colonization takes place, it seems unlikely that such restraints
would survive the expansion of humanity across the solar system.

It might be objected that the breakout of an ASI in some remote world in
solar space would not pose a general existential threat to humanity once
all of humanity's eggs are no longer in one basket. If, however, we take
seriously the standard scenarios of what an ASI would do once it
emerges, [the [dispersion of humanity]{.mark} across multiple worlds
[would afford **no**]{.mark} **[protection]{.mark}** whatsoever [because
an **uncontrolled A**]{.mark}S**[I]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it is widely
anticipated, [[will]{.mark} in short order [expand]{.mark} not just on
the planet of its origins but [**across the solar system**,]{.mark}
indeed the
galaxy]{.underline}.[26](https://oxford-universitypressscholarship-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/view/10.1093/oso/9780190903343.001.0001/oso-9780190903343-chapter-10#oso-9780190903343-miscMatter-9-note-818)
[To the extent uncontrolled ASI is deemed something to avoid at all
costs, large-scale space expansion must be viewed
similarly.]{.underline}

[Terrestrial arrangements to [restrain **nuclear, genetic, and
nanotech**]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} are also [likely to be
**[reversed]{.mark}** as humanity expands to other worlds.]{.underline}
The prospects of interworld and interspecies wars will provide large
incentives for maintaining weaponized nuclear capabilities and for
[[pursuing research into military genetic]{.mark} and nanotechnology
applications. Any restraint regime for genetic technologies is unlikely
to survive extensive human expansion into space, given the
attractiveness of directed and **accelerated species alteration** in
off-worlds.]{.underline} Solar space contains a vast number of islands
for potential Doctors Moreau to work their alchemy, as memorably
envisioned in Robinson's 2312. If self-replicating nanomachines are
possible and built on Earth, human existence will be threatened. But if
a relinquishment regime is established on Earth, it is unlikely to
survive in a solar diaspora. [While interplanetary [distances]{.mark}
will afford a buffer from runaway replicators on other celestial bodies,
this is unlikely to be permanently effective, thus [delaying]{.mark}
rather than foreclosing the [gray-goo]{.mark}ization of the
Earth.]{.underline}

[[Fourth]{.mark}, **[solar expansion]{.mark}** poses catastrophic and
existential risks to humanity [through **hierarchy enablement**]{.mark}.
The emergence of totalitarian world government,]{.underline} nearly
[universally viewed as deeply undesirable]{.underline}, [is]{.underline}
reasonably [judged a catastrophic threat to humanity]{.underline}. As we
have seen, [[space expansion]{.mark} is likely to]{.underline} (p.361)
[[produce hierarchies]{.mark} in several significant ways.]{.underline}
Many space advocates view large-scale space expansion as freedom
insurance and anticipate that various forms of freedom and plurality
deemed in jeopardy on Earth can be recovered and preserved in space. But
anticipations of a freedom dividend from space expansion are largely
illusory because [large-scale space expansion into Earth orbital space
is very likely to enable the erection of a highly hierarchical world
government, either from [one-state]{.mark} military [dominance]{.mark}
of the entire planet or from the control of a major infrastructure for
resources or energy. The further large-scale expansion of human activity
into solar space is likely to facilitate the emergence of a highly
hierarchical world government on Island Earth that could then be [prone
to become **totalitarian**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [fifth way]{.mark} in which ambitious space expansion poses
catastrophic and existential risks [is through **alien
generation**.]{.mark} The [human]{.mark} species [radiation]{.mark}
anticipated by expansionists will [generate]{.mark} significantly
different forms of **[intelligent life]{.mark}** suited to other
worlds]{.underline}. If these anticipations are realized, [there will be
multiple intelligent species]{.underline}, all descendants from
terrestrial Homo sapiens, [in this solar system and eventually across
the galaxy.]{.underline} While space expansionists celebrate this as an
expansion of life, they rarely dwell on its implications for the future
of human life. If ascentionist assumptions about moral improvement
resulting from vertical expansion are true, humanity and its descendant
species will live in harmony. But if ascentionist assumptions are
unfounded, then [the generation of alien intelligent species in this
solar system should be viewed as a catastrophic and existential threat
to humanity]{.underline}. As the cyber visionary Hans Moravec observes,
"biological species almost never survive encounters with superior
competitors."[27](https://oxford-universitypressscholarship-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/view/10.1093/oso/9780190903343.001.0001/oso-9780190903343-chapter-10#oso-9780190903343-miscMatter-9-note-819)
While habitat space expansionists embrace the Darwinian proposition that
life inevitably expands, they do not seem to have thought through the
implications of the corollary proposition that life forms often lethally
compete.

[The mechanisms for the [annihilation]{.mark} of humans [by]{.mark}
advanced forms of [extraterrestrial]{.mark} life, long a staple of
dystopian SF, are easy enough to imagine. While it might be possible for
humanity, mobilized and directed by a centralized world government
devoted to planetary and species defense, to survive for a while,
eventually the [sheer number]{.mark} and variety of alien species [with
advanced tech]{.mark}nology [is sure to prevai]{.mark}l.]{.underline}
Fictional accounts of alien threats to humanity are typically about life
forms originating on other planets, and their eventual defeat commonly
results from improbable expedients and heroics. [The more realistic
threat is probably from humanity's descendants]{.underline}, and this
threat can simply be prevented from arising by relinquishing space
colonization.

[[The sixth way]{.mark} in which ambitious space expansion is related to
catastrophic and existential risk [is through]{.mark} **[monster
multiplication]{.mark}**. The number of "monsters," threats that are
unknown, has,]{.underline} we are told by riskologists, [been steadily
growing]{.underline} (p.362) [with the development of powerful new
technologies]{.underline}. Some monsters are in principle knowable, but
others may be unknowable to humans. [Ambitious space expansion will
clearly entail the development of [**powerful new
tech**nologies]{.mark}, and the actors developing these technologies
will be spread in multiple worlds across the solar system. Therefore it
stands to reason that the number of monsters [posing]{.mark} potential
**[terminal threats]{.mark}** will inevitably increase as ambitious
space expansionist projects are realized.]{.underline}

Taken together, [these six ways]{.underline} in which the realization of
the space expansionist program for solar space pose catastrophic and
existential threats [demolish the core proposition of space advocates
that large-scale expansion is desirable]{.underline}. Space
expansionists start with the persuasive proposition that technological
capabilities for destruction are rapidly enlarging, while the Earth
remains spatially finite. They then reason that expanding the spatial
range of human activities through expansion into outer space will dilute
dangers and bring the ratios between the powers of destruction and the
spatial domain of human activity into safer proportions. But they fail
to recognize or acknowledge that the potency of the destructive
potentials inherent in space expansion also increases, and these
capabilities can potentially be brought to bear on the finite and
fragile Earth and its human populations, thus [making the survival
problem, at least for the Earth and humanity, much greater. If humans,
or their alien progeny, occupying this vaster spatial realm behave in
the same manner as they have on Earth, all that will have changed is
that [the magnitude of the threats will]{.mark} have been
[enlarge]{.mark}d.]{.underline} For large-scale space expansion, there
is no plausible human path of preservation bypassing its many very
likely menaces and monstrosities. For humanity in space, there is only
darkness at the end of the tunnel.

So, [what happens in]{.underline} the unlikely [event]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} those [measures fail]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
the first crewed [[mission]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to
Mars]{.underline}]{.mark} [[sets]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[alien
microbes]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[loose]{.underline}]{.mark} [on
Earth]{.underline}? We don't know, and that's what makes containment so
important. The whole thing could play out like a microscopic version of
H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds, where terrifying Martian invaders are
killed off by Earth viruses. If extraterrestrial microbes escape from
containment, they might not last long out in the world, where they have
to compete with Earth's own battalions of bacteria and viruses. Of
course we might see the opposite scenario. [Extraterrestrial
[microbes]{.mark}]{.underline} might [thrive]{.underline} [in Earth's
environment]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} they might
**[[out-compete]{.underline}]{.mark}** many [Earth
**microbes**]{.underline}, [just like]{.underline} today's terrestrial
**[invasive species]{.underline}** --- which are problematic enough
without help from other worlds. [[Humans]{.underline}]{.mark} [would
[have no]{.mark}]{.underline} natural
**[[immunity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to **Martian
pathogens**]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[whole
species]{.underline}]{.mark} [might be [**wiped**
**out**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So you might think of extraterrestrial
microbes as the potential next version of Ebola, which explains the
Biohazard Level 4 recommendation. But [humans]{.underline}
[aren't]{.underline} [the only ones]{.underline} [in
danger]{.underline}. [Extraterrestrial]{.underline}
[[microbes]{.underline}]{.mark} [could]{.underline} rapidly **[[wipe
out]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Earth's]{.underline} [other]{.underline}
**[[animal]{.mark} [species]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[plants]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
**microbes**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That might actually be a more
horrific scenario: humanity survives, but [[all]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[animals]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [plants]{.underline}
[[we]{.underline}]{.mark} [[depend on]{.underline}]{.mark} for
sustenance **[[die off]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [or]{.underline} all [the
microbes]{.underline} that play such a vital role in our environment
[are displaced]{.underline} [by alien microbes that don't fill the same
roles]{.underline}. There's probably an excellent post-apocalyptic novel
waiting to be built around that scenario.

#### Mars colonization causes [infectious diseases]{.underline} AND [turns the case]{.underline}.

**Lackey '18** (Katherine; Money NOW Editor @ USA Today; December 18;
"Dangerous life on Mars? Humans could be infected and we could kill
microbes on the Red Planet";
<https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/12/18/humans-could-kill-life-mars-could-infected/2216930002/>;
accessed 7/27/19; MSCOTT)

Throughout history, [[every time humans have explored new places, one of
the biggest issues we have faced is **inf(e)ctious
diseases**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- on both sides.

[Not only did **explorers bring pathogens**]{.underline} [to local
populations whose immune systems couldn\'t fight off an unfamiliar
disease, but those **[locals also harbored bacteria and viruses that
infected the adventurers]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

So what happens if there\'s life on Mars and humans travel there?

\"Anytime there\'s a new introduction, on both sides, there\'s a lot of
risks. We all can be harboring things that can create risk for the other
side,\" said Pardis Sabeti, professor of immunology and infectious
diseases at Harvard University. \"[There\'s all sorts of ways that when
different life forms interact for the first time, all sorts of
intentional and **[unintentional destruction can
happen]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

NASA has been sending rovers to Mars for decades, including InSight,
which recently landed there, but the landers get throughly scrubbed
before they\'re launched into space. And none of the vehicles have made
a return trip to Earth.

[With human travel to Mars on the horizon -- NASA recently put the
timetable at least 25 years -- we must be prepared for the potential
that a **[Martian microbe could harm us]{.mark}**]{.underline}, said
Sabeti, who speaks about that possibility on National Geographic\'s
\"MARS\" series.

\"There\'s not a high reason to think that [there\'s an infectious
disease there that can infect us and become problematic to us, but if it
could, then it [could **rapidly become really
problematic**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" she said.

[But a bigger issue could be us: Human bodies contain trillions of
bacteria, and those [could]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[infect the Red
Planet]{.underline}**]{.mark} instead, said Casey Dreier, chief advocate
and senior pace policy adviser at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit
organization that promotes space exploration.

\"Every spacesuit is just leaking off viruses and bacteria that just are
coming from the microbiome of the astronauts,\" Dreier said. \"[If we
**introduce microbes to Mars**, would those inadvertently consume or
wipe out or **[take over these potential habitable niches on the surface
of Mars]{.mark}** or in the subsurface of Mars, and actually destroy any
life potentially hanging out on the Red Planet]{.underline}?\"

[The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is causing [COVID]{.mark} 19
disease, has [taught us]{.mark} unexpected lessons [about]{.mark} the
**[dangers of]{.mark} human [extinction through]{.mark} highly
contagious and lethal [diseases]{.mark}.**]{.underline} As the [COVID 19
pandemic is now being controlled by various isolation measures,
therapeutics and vaccines, it became clear that [our current
lifestyle]{.mark} and societal functions [may not be sustainable]{.mark}
in the long term.]{.underline} **[[We]{.mark} now [have to start]{.mark}
thinking and [planning on]{.mark} how to face [the next]{.mark}
dangerous [pandemic,]{.mark}]{.underline}** not just overcoming the one
that is upon us now[. [Is there]{.mark} any [evi]{.mark}dence that even
[worse pandemics]{.mark} could [strike]{.mark} us [in the]{.mark}
[**near future** and threaten the **existence of the human
race**?]{.mark} The answer **is [unequivocally
yes]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [It is not necessary to get infected by
viruses of bats, pangolins and other exotic animals that live in remote
forests in order to be in danger. Creditable scientific evidence
indicates that [the human gut]{.mark} microbiota **[harbor billions of
viruses]{.mark}** which are [capable of affecting]{.mark} the function
of [vital]{.mark} human [organs]{.mark} such as the immune system, lung,
brain, liver, kidney, heart etc.]{.underline} It is possible that the
development of pathogenic variants in the gut can lead to contagious
viruses which can cause pandemics, leading to destruction of vital
organs, causing death or various debilitating diseases such as
blindness, respiratory, liver, heart and kidney failures. **[These
[diseases could result \[in\]]{.mark} the complete [shutdown]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} our [civilization and probably]{.mark} the
[extinction]{.mark} of human race]{.underline}**. In this essay, [I will
first provide a few independent pieces of scientific facts and then
combine this information to come up with some (but certainly not all)
hypothetical scenarios that could cause human race misery, even
extinction.]{.underline} [I hope that these scary scenarios will trigger
[preventative measures]{.mark} that [could reverse or delay]{.mark} the
projected [adverse outcomes]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Space is a [breeding ground]{.underline} for [adaptive]{.underline} and [lethal microbes]{.underline} -- space colonization [increases]{.underline} the risk of [disease spread]{.underline}.

**[[Influenza]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[[microbes]{.mark}
[like]{.mark} [coronavirus]{.mark}]{.underline}** could **[[quickly work
their way through]{.underline}]{.mark}** a [**[crew]{.mark}** isolated
together **[in]{.mark}** the depths of **[space]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
"The [**[absence of gravity]{.mark}** [precludes **particles**]{.mark}
[settling down]{.mark}]{.underline}, so [they stay suspended in the air,
and **could be [more easily transmitted]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To
prevent this, compartments are ventilated and the air HEPA filters would
remove particles," Jonathan Clark, a former six-time crew surgeon for
NASA's Space Shuttle program, stated. A 2012 study examining health
records of [742 astronauts who flew on 106 flights revealed [29 cases of
disease transmission]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including
fungal]{.underline}, urinary tract, and skin [infections]{.underline},
as well as the [flu]{.underline}. "For reasons scientists have not quite
figured out, the immune system can go on the fritz in space: wounds heal
more slowly; [**[infection-fighting T-cells]{.mark}** send signals
[**less** **efficient**]{.mark}ly]{.underline}; [bone marrow replenishes
itself less effectively; **[killer cells]{.mark}** --- another key
immune system player --- **fight [less
energetic]{.mark}ally**]{.underline}. At the same time, the
**[[pathogens grow stronger]{.underline}]{.mark}**, developing [thicker
cell walls]{.underline}, [greater resistance to antimicrobial
agents]{.underline} and a [greater ability to [form]{.mark} so-called
[biofilms]{.mark} that cling to surfaces]{.underline}," Jeffrey Kluger
reported in Time Magazine. [Physical changes]{.underline} caused by
**[[radiation]{.underline}]{.mark}** may [**[present problems]{.mark}**
[keeping]{.mark} astronauts and [space colonists
healthy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Another challenge for space travelers is
that **[[dormant viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like [herpes
simplex]{.underline}, can [**[reawaken]{.mark}** **[during space
travel]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Visitors have spent a year or more aboard
the International Space Station. Colonists on the Moon or Mars would
stay even longer, [increasing health issues]{.underline} including sleep
deprivation, even without an epidemic. Without proper sleep, and
suffering from high stress levels, space travelers could be even more
[susceptible to infections their bodies]{.underline} may have fought off
at home. "The types of problems you may encounter are a decline in mood,
cognition, morale, or interpersonal interaction. You could also develop
a sleep disorder because your circadian rhythm might be thrown off due
to the 38 extra minutes each day on Mars, or by a small, noisy
environment, or the stress of prolonged isolation and confinement,"
NASA's Human Research Program suggests.

Just as on Earth, isolation and containment of those potentially
infected by a disease. The International Space Station is equipped with
high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and containment masks
are available for infected residents of the ISS. Following any sort of
infection, space travelers could be quarantined after returning to
Earth, as they were in the early days of human space travel. Future
colonies on the Moon or Mars will, almost certainly, have similar
facilities for lessening the reach of outbreaks like the one currently
engulfing our planet. [Answers to the challenges of]{.underline}
epidemics on Earth --- [much less on lunar or Martian
colonies]{.underline} --- [remains unanswered]{.underline}. And,
[viruses are more likely to spread, and be harder to treat, in space
than they are on Earth]{.underline}. But, many of the same treatments
and procedures that we employ on Earth to limit the spread of disease
and to flatten the curve of infections would also likely play
significant roles in protecting colonists exploring the Solar System.
**[[As we expand]{.mark} out [into]{.mark} the [solar system]{.mark},
[epidemics]{.mark} are [bound to follow us]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But,
even today, we are already protecting the explorers who are pioneering
our quest to reach beyond the confines of our planet.

#### Going to space linearly increases risk of alien contact

[[The human race **will** find life elsewhere]{.mark} in the Universe
**[as it pushes ahead with space exploration]{.mark}**]{.underline},
reported astronauts of the space shuttle Endeavour. The US space shuttle
Endeavour prepares today to undock from the International Space Station
and jet back to Earth, wrapping up its final journey before entering
retirement, NASA said. \"[**[If we push back boundaries far
enough]{.mark}**, I\'m sure **[eventually we\'ll find something out
there]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" [said Mike Foreman, a mission
specialist]{.underline} on the Endeavour, \"[Maybe not as evolved as we
are, but [it\'s **hard to believe that there is not life somewhere
else**]{.mark} in this great Universe]{.underline},\" he added. "I
personally believe that [[we are **going to find
something**]{.underline}]{.mark} that we can\'t explain,\" said another
astronaut, Gregory Johnson. \"[There is probably something out
there]{.underline} but I\'ve never seen it,\" he said. Dominic Gorie,
the crew commander and veteran of four space flights, points out that
[explorers in past eras did not know what they would find **before
setting off across the ocean**]{.underline}. \"[As we travel in the
space, **we don\'t know what we\'ll find**]{.underline}. That\'s the
beauty of what we do. I hope that someday we\'ll find what we don\'t
understand.\" Takao Doi, a Japanese astronaut on past Endeavour
missions, agreed \"[[life like us **must** exist]{.underline}]{.mark}\"
elsewhere in the Universe. The comments come after a surprisingly
high-level debate in Japan about UFOs. Japan\'s Foreign Minister,
Nobutaka Machimura said in 2007 that he personally believed aliens
existed, in an unusual rebuttal to a government statement that Japan had
no knowledge of UFOs. Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba went as far as to
say that he was studying the legal ramifications of responding to an
alien attack in light of Japan\'s post-World War II pacifist
constitution. At the celebration marking the 50th anniversary of NASA,
[**[Stephen Hawking]{.mark}**, Newton\'s heir as the Lucasian Professor
of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, [answered the question,
"Are we alone?"]{.mark} His answer is short and simple; **[probably
not!]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Extinction!

Brent **Swancer 18**, citing Stephen Hawking, one of the smartest people
to ever live, \"First Contact: Would Aliens Be Our Friends or
Enemies?\", Mysterious Universe,
https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2018/11/first-contact-would-aliens-be-our-friends-or-enemies/

Of course, not everyone has a rosy view of alien contact, and there are
just as many people, if not more, who firmly believe that
[[extraterrestrial intelligences]{.mark} [would]{.mark} almost certainly
**[be malevolent towards us]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[could]{.mark} even **[spell the end of life
as we know it]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The sinister rationale here is
that [one need only look at how [we **humans on earth**]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} exploited resources and other peoples and **[wiped each
other out]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In this scenario, [[aliens would
be]{.underline} **[nefarious]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [**[resource
hungry]{.underline}**, **[aggressive beings]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and
[here to]{.mark} either [**enslave us** or **exterminate us**]{.mark}
for whatever reasons]{.underline}. [If they are anything like us, then
the idea is that [we should be **very worried**]{.mark} **about meeting
them**]{.underline}. [One of the most well-known proponents of the idea
that aliens will be hostile was **[legendary physicist Stephen
Hawking]{.mark}**, who famously once [said]{.mark}: [If aliens visit
us]{.mark}, [the outcome would be much as **when Columbus
landed**]{.mark} in America]{.underline}, [which didn't turn out well
for the Native Americans]{.underline}. **[We only have to look at
ourselves]{.underline}** [to see how intelligent life might develop into
**something we wouldn't want to meet.**]{.underline}

### SSA ADV\-\--SC Bad\-\--Interstellar War

#### Space colonization causes [existential]{.underline} wars -- [secessionist movements]{.underline}, [reactionist colonies]{.underline}, and [inter-colonial]{.underline} conflict [outweigh]{.underline} every [terrestrial war in history]{.underline}. 

**Kovic '21** \[Marko; February 2021; independent researcher and PhD at
Institute of Mass Communication and Media Research, University of
Zurich; Futures, "Risks of space colonization," vol. 126; kp\]

5 **[Conflict risks]{.underline}**

[Conflict risks are risks that are created by the prospect of **hostile
actors** or powers in the context of **space colonization**. Conflict
risks are in principle not unlike conflicts that humankind has
experienced throughout its Earth-based history, but they are **much
greater** in **scope and severity**]{.underline}. The four conflict
risks I focus on are depicted in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Conflict risks of space colonization.

I identify two catastrophic and two existential conflict risks.

5.1 [**Secession** and **independence conflicts**]{.underline}

[**Human habitats** beyond Earth are **likely**]{.underline} to remain
modest in the near- term future. The International Space Station,
humankind's most advanced habitat-like project so far, can accommodate
six people and is dependent on supplies from Earth. More ambitious
colonization projects such as SpaceX's plan for Mars colonies typically
envision what amounts to very small and simple camps \[39\]. Managing
such simple colonization projects should be doable legally and
politically. With more mature colonies, however, the pic- ture changes.

Imagine, [for example]{.underline}, the [large, **self-sustaining
habitat** on **Venus** that consists of 2 billion people]{.underline}
that I mentioned in a thought experiment before. [That hypothetical
habitat is truly **self-sustainable**, in the sense that survival on
Venus is not contingent in any way on resources or other kinds of
support from Earth. [If **prior**]{.mark} **human [history]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} an **[indication]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it is conceivable
that [the **[Venusians]{.mark}** could at some point seek to **change**
their **political status**. They might want to **no longer** be
**governed by Earth** or Earth-based governements and instead have
sovereignty to **autonomously** and freely shape Venus' future. They
[might]{.mark}]{.underline}, in other words, seek to
[**[seceede]{.mark}** and become an independent political
entity.]{.underline}

[[Given]{.mark} prior human [history of **secession**]{.mark} and
independence movements, such a claim to [**independence** in]{.mark} the
context of **[space col]{.mark}onization** could **easily
[result]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **violent [conflict]{.mark}**, and given
the scale of the conflict parties in this scenario, the **bloodshed**
could be **much [greater]{.mark}** [than **all**]{.mark} **the
[wars]{.mark}** that happened [in]{.mark} **Earth's [history]{.mark}**
so far]{.underline}. Of course, we do not know what the dominant
political philosophy of the future will be. Perhaps popular sovereignty
and the wish for autonomy will be fully respected and met with
unconditional, enlightened understanding. But that prospect is, at best,
uncertain, and the prospect of catastrophic violent conflicts seems at
least possible.

5.2 **[Reactionary colonies]{.underline}**

[Let us assume for the sake of argument that]{.underline} the risks
surrounding secession- ist claims of extraterrestrial colonies will
eventually have been overcome and that [there are colonies which have
attained a **country-like** or world-like status. What should the
**political systems** in and the **moral foundations** of those
independent colonies look like? **Ideally**, they would be at least as
democratic, liberal, and generally morally progressive]{.underline} as
the most democratic, liberal, and morally progressive countries today.
[More specifically, independent fu- ture colonies should have
socio-political systems that do not **lower** average **wellbeing** or
**create**]{.underline} (disproportionately) **[more
suffering]{.underline}** compared to their pre-existing peers such as
Earth-based countries (Or whatever the dominant polity on Earth in that
future might be.). [**However**, [there is **no guarantee**]{.mark} that
independent [colonies will meet]{.mark} that **socio-political** and
**[moral bar]{.mark}**. It is possible that [there will be colonies
whose]{.mark} socio-political [systems are **regressive**]{.mark} in one
way or another, marked by a **relative moral decay** compared to the
baseline of political systems and moral frameworks. I call
such]{.underline} potential [undesirable entities **reactionary
colonies**.]{.underline}

The [emergence of reactionary colonies **might seem implausible** given
that humankind has, very roughly speaking, so far morally improved over
the course of its history]{.underline}8. [But reactionary colonies might
actually be a **fairly common** future development]{.underline}. If
humankind at some point achieves the tech- nological means for creating
colonies with relative ease, [creating new [colonies might be an
**attractive**]{.mark} **option** [for **extremist**]{.mark}
**group[s]{.mark}** and **beliefs**. Imagine]{.underline}, for example,
[a **religious group** that believes in the fundamental **superiority**
of men over women. Such a religious group might find it difficult
adhering to their flawed moral principles in a pluralistic society.
Opting for **colonial exodus** might represent an attractive opportunity
for that religious group to build a society from scratch which is based
on their notions of female **inferiority** and
**subjugation**.]{.underline}

The specific risk posed by reactionary colonies ist twofold.
[[Reactionary colonies would]{.mark} by definition **lower** the
**average happiness** and **wellbeing** of humankind and [create]{.mark}
unnecessary, preventable **[suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Reactionary colonies would also represent potential rogue actors that
could greatly amplify the aberration risks described in section 4. For
example, [a **[dictatorial regime]{.mark}** that causes great suffering
to its population might be tempted to expand its dictatorial
**ideology** to other colonies. Or that dictatorial colony could be [led
by]{.mark} a [**psychopathic elite** that enjoys]{.mark} letting
**[sentient simulations suffer]{.mark}** as much as
possible]{.underline}. The [potential catastrophic and even
**[existential]{.mark}** **multiplicator [effects]{.mark}** of
reactionary colonies [are]{.mark}, unfortunately,
**[numerous]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

5.3 **[Inter-colonial conflict]{.underline}**

[Let us, again for the sake of the argument, assume that the previous
problem of reactionary colonies has somehow been solved or avoided.
Humankind has]{.underline} continued its path of technological
development, and it has [established several large clusters of colonies
beyond the Solar system]{.underline}. Assuming that the fundamental
problem of faster-than-light communication has not been solved yet,
[**communication** between the clusters **lags months** or even
**years**, and physical contact between the clusters is rare since
travel takes even longer than communication.]{.underline}

The [**inevitable [consequence]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} such a
**[splintering]{.mark}** of human [civilization is]{.mark} that the
different clusters of colonies would over time develop [**distinct
cultures**, and]{.mark} with only scarce and delayed contact with other
clusters, a form of **[intergroup bias]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[40\],
[the **moral preference** of one's own **in-group** over the
**out-group**, would likely start to **manifest**]{.underline}. Over
time, [that **[us-versus- them]{.mark}** heuristic could help [create
**distinct**]{.mark} and **solidified** **social [identities]{.mark}**
within the colony clusters]{.underline} \[41\], [and the beliefs and
preferences about the outgroup colonies could become more **overtly
negative**]{.underline}. Given enough time and great enough
idiosyncratic development within each colony cluster, [the cultural and
moral connections between the colony clusters could **further
erode**]{.underline}, and in their place, [a sense of **dread** and
**looming danger** about the others' goals and preferences could take
hold]{.underline}. Over a long enough period of time and great enough
separation, [the perception that other colonies are a threat could grow;
so much so that taking **[preventative action]{.mark}** and attacking
and suppressing them [might seem]{.mark} like the most
**[rational]{.mark}** course of action]{.underline} \[42\].
[[Given]{.mark} the **scale** and the likely **technological
sophistication** of **[future weapons]{.mark} systems**, a violent
[conflict]{.mark} between advanced colonies and colony clusters [would
create **suffering** on a]{.mark}n [**astronomical
scale**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Of course, the prospect of inter-colonial conflict is somewhat
speculative \[43\]. But [given humankind's **past experiences**, violent
conflict clearly seems within the realm of the possible]{.underline}.
That does not mean that such an almost immeasurably terrible conflict is
unavoidable. [[Even]{.mark} the **[slightest probability]{.mark}** of
such conflict, however, [means **immense**]{.mark} potential expected
**[disvalue]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### That causes [nanobots]{.underline}, [pathogens]{.underline}, and [asteroid terrorism]{.underline}\-\--there all [independent extinction scenarios]{.underline} that happen at [lightspeed]{.underline}\-\--means [deterrence and rationality are impossible]{.underline}.

**Torres '18** (Phil; Project for Future Human Flourishing; *Space
colonization and suﬀering risks: Reassessing the "maxipok rule"*;
Futures 100 (2018) 74-85; MSCOTT)

[One might surmise here that a balance of terror could establish bipolar
stability, just as MAD did during the Cold War. Yet this appears
**implausible given the weapons**]{.underline} [mentioned
above]{.underline}. For example, [if [one side could release
**self-replicating nanobots that disarm**]{.mark}]{.underline}
~~cripple~~ **[[the target civilization before it can
retaliate]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the result would be a terror
imbalance that, under certain circumstances, [would **make a ﬁrst strike
game theoretically rational**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [Kurzweil
outlines a scenario in which [ecophages destroy the entire biosphere of
Earth within ∼90 min]{.mark}]{.underline}. This would involve a
two-stage attack: ﬁrst, [a small population of nanobots would spread
around the globe, and second, at an "optimal" time this population would
begin to self-replicate at an exponential pace]{.underline}. To put this
in perspective, signal delays between Earth and Mars range from 4 to 24
min, depending on where each planet is in its orbit, and travel times
range from 150 to 300 days. [Add to [this]{.mark} the inevitable lag of
bureaucracies and the outcome [is a **serious credibility-of-deterrence
problem**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even more, some future genius could
invent a far more eﬀective way of weaponizing nanobots in the next 100
years, at which point humanity will probably have established martian
colonies]{.underline}.19 Related scenarios involving designer pathogens
that initiate "engineered global pandemics" or planetoid bombs capable
of obliterating whole metropolises---or perhaps an entire ecumenopolis,
if one ex- ists---could also be imagined, although I will leave this
task for the reader.

But the [situation is far worse than this, because
**[ecophages]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[pathogens]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and]{.underline}
**[[asteroids]{.underline}]{.mark}** [won't pose the greatest risks to
inter- planetary peace: [**heliobeams**,]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[DEWs]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[gravity
waves]{.underline}**]{.mark} [not only [could inﬂict catastrophic
damage]{.mark} on their targets but they could do this at or **[near
lightspeed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In a ﬂash, one civilization could
cripple the other's key military and/or civilian infrastructure, thus
rendering it unable to eﬀectively respond to an attack]{.underline}.
Furthermore, since the speed of light imposes an upper bound on
information transfer, [[there could be]{.mark}, in principle, **[no
early-warning systems to alert the target civilization]{.mark} that an
attack has commenced**]{.underline}, [which would severely compromise
its ability to initiate defensive measures]{.underline}. One might here
wonder: perhaps the attackee could overcome this defensive vulnerability
by stationing counterstrike military drones throughout the solar system.
They could be programmed to launch a coordinated attack if they fail to
receive a "no-strike" signal that is ordinarily sent to them every few
minutes. Thus, the destruction of key military infrastructure would
result in the cessation of this signal and therefore the initiation of a
counterstrike. But [this too appears otiose since a ﬁrst strike using,
say, DEWs could simply target these drones as well. The result is that
**[threats of retaliation]{.mark} from each civilization [would be
literally in-credible and the balance of terror would
collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Here we should also not overlook the **[potential for accidents to
cause conﬂicts when inter-civilizational tensions are suﬃciently
high]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The disturbing historical fact is that
"pure dumb luck" played a critical role in preventing nuclear war from
occurring during the Cold War. Individuals like Vasili Arkhipov and
Stanislav Petrov more or less single-handedly averted nuclear
holocausts, and an interpretation error in 1995 led Boris Yeltsin to
become "the ﬁrst Russian president to ever have the 'nuclear suitcase'
open in front of him" (Cirincione, 2013). Although intelligence is
negatively correlated with accident proneness, and presumably our
(post)human descendants will be cognitively enhanced to some extent,
[even a small probability of error could make disaster almost
certain]{.underline} (see Torres, forthcoming). For example,
[[imagine]{.mark} that [a mere 500 people have access to a
"button"]{.mark} that, if pushed, would initiate a catastrophic ﬁrst
strike against the other civilization. If each of these individuals has
a mere 0.01 chance per decade of accidentally pushing this button, [the
result is a staggering 99.3 percent probability that, within 10 years,
the strike will occur]{.mark}]{.underline}. So, perhaps Earth and
Mars---whose civilizations could potentially coexist for another 10
million centuries, until the sun burns out---won't be quite as lucky as
the US and Soviet Union were for the slightly more than four decades
between 1947 and 1991.

The ﬁnal step in the present argument is to project this bi-planetary
predicament into the vast reaches of outer space. [Consider the
**[billions and billions and billions of populations that could come to
occupy a universe with 10 trillion galaxies and 1024
stars]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [each with its own traditions, boasting of
weapons that could destroy entire galaxies or even the entire universe,
and embedded [in a **cosmo-political system of lawless
anarchy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There is no supreme governing system to
provide security and no policies of deterrence to reliably prevent ﬁrst
strikes. It is [hard to imagine how such a predicament could avoid
**constant and catastrophic wars between
civilizations**]{.mark}]{.underline} [both near and far]{.underline}.
Indeed, theorists like Waltz (1979) have argued that multipolar state
conﬁgurations are less stable and more prone to conﬂict than bipolar
conﬁgurations. The reason is that uncertainty increases with the number
of actors, and as uncertainty increases, so does distrust of everyone
else's intentions. [Hence, the more civilizations there are in the
universe, the greater the incentive for Tuckerian actors to preventively
or preemptively strike their neighbors]{.underline}---or to induce a
vacuum bubble in the hope that an "assembler" on the "other side" can
enable some form of post-transition survival[. The point is that [the
future will be marked by **radical multipolarity**, and this will
greatly increase the probability of violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet
[the diﬃculty of establishing Earth-independent colonies on Mars without
catastrophic wars---as outlined above---suggests that our descendants
might not make it beyond the solar system]{.underline}. In fact, Deudney
(in press) argues that attempts to colonize space could constitute the
Great Filter that explains why we see no evidence of intelligent aliens
crying out for cosmic companionship in a universe slowly sinking into
thermodynamic equilibrium.20

### SSA ADV\-\--SC Bad\-\--AT: Bostrom

#### Bostrom [agrees]{.underline} stopping [existing existential risks]{.underline} outweigh [space colonization]{.underline}. 

**Kovic '21** \[Marko; February 2021; independent researcher and PhD at
Institute of Mass Communication and Media Research, University of
Zurich; Futures, "Risks of space colonization," vol. 126; kp\]

3.1 **[Neglecting existential risks]{.underline}**

[**Space colonization** is]{.underline}, as I argue in the introduction,
[a generalized strategy for the **mitigation** of **existential risks**:
If we manage to establish permanent and sustainable habitats beyond
Earth, there is a chance that existential risks would either become
**less probable**]{.underline} or cease to be existential at all because
not all proverbial eggs are in the same basket. [Given this premise, [it
is **tempting** to **extrapolate**]{.mark} it into real-life policy: If
space colonization is a **hedge** against existential
risks]{.underline}, then [achieving [space col]{.mark}onization
capabilities [must be]{.mark} our **top
[priority]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The [**[problem]{.mark}** with this prioritization strategy [is]{.mark}
that while it might]{.underline}, on its own, [increase the probability
of space colonization, [it ignores]{.mark} the probabilities of
**[existing ex]{.mark}istential [risks]{.mark}**. If we want to create
as **positive a future** for humankind]{.underline} (in the sense of
increasing humankind's future moral expected value), [then we need to
weigh the benefits of achieving space colonization capabilities
**sooner** **rather than later** against the benefits of reducing
**existential risks**. When we compare the benefits of these two
approaches, as **[Bostrom]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[2, 5\] [[argues,
it]{.mark} **quickly [becomes obvious]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} that the
[benefits of]{.mark} even [**marginally reducing**
**ex**]{.mark}**istential risks** over a given time period [are]{.mark}
probably **much [greater]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} the **damage** of
**[delaying space col]{.mark}onization**]{.underline} by that same time
period.

### SSA ADV\-\--SC Bad\-\--AT: Extinction Inevitable

#### Extinction not inevitable\-\--we can save Earth but only if we focus solely on it

Amitai **Etzioni, 18**, 8-25-2018, University Professor at The George
Washington University and author, most recently, of Happiness is the
Wrong Metric, \"Humanity Would Be Better off Saving Earth, Rather Than
Colonizing Mars\",

AVD

Second, [if the [colonization]{.mark}]{.underline} of Mars [moves beyond
the subject of workshops]{.underline} and cocktail party chit-chat into
a major project, [it [brings]{.mark} with it an [unavoidable]{.mark}
subtext of **[despair]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite the fact that what
Musk, Hawking, and others propose it as a backup plan, [[it
suggests]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} may well [fail to save]{.mark} Mother
[Earth and]{.mark} that [it is time to search for another]{.mark}
planetary [home]{.mark}, to save the species, even if not mankind. But
what the [droughts]{.mark}, the fires, the hot summers, [and]{.mark} the
melting [glaciers call]{.mark} for is not an escape from Earth, but [a
redoubling of the efforts]{.mark} to save it. Some hold that [**the next
decade is**]{.mark} a [**critical**]{.mark} period, [**as the
window**]{.mark} of opportunity [to save]{.mark} the [earth is]{.mark}
rapidly [narrowing.]{.mark}]{.underline} Others hold that we have more
leeway. However, there is wide agreement that merely dialing down
economic activity may be neither sufficient nor politically feasible.
[[What is needed are major tech]{.mark}nological [breakthroughs]{.mark}
that will allow for protecting earth while sustaining a healthy level of
economic activity]{.underline}. Developing artificial leaves, that can
turn carbon dioxide into oxygen, and be mass-produced much more quickly
than their natural counterparts, is a telling example. [[To make such
breakthroughs we need major concentrations of]{.mark} research and
development [resources]{.mark}, talent, and leadership, all of which are
in short supply. [Hence, any]{.mark} serious [Mars endeavor will]{.mark}
inevitably [cut into the drive to save]{.mark} Mother
[Earth.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The risk of extinction [isn't high enough]{.underline} to justify settlement.

**Szocik '18** (Konrad; University of Information Technology and
Management in Rzeszow, Department of Philosophy and Cognitive Science;

4.5. **[There is [no risk]{.mark} on Earth [suﬃcient to justify]{.mark}
the expense of a [space]{.mark} refuge]{.underline}**

[Space refuge is justiﬁed only when there is at least one kind of
catastrophe on Earth which will lead to extinction of the entire human
species]{.underline}. Baum (2015) and [Baum et al. (2015) **do not
believe that [space settlement oﬀers advantage over terrestrial
refuge]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [If terrestrial refuge (**aquatic and/or
subterranean**]{.underline}) [is able to protect against the strongest
catastrophes including asteroid impact, the unique serious rationale
accepted by public opinion for space human mission fails]{.underline}.
As Turchin and Green (2017) show, aquatic refuges based on adaptation of
nuclear submarines may eﬀectively play their role. They may be surface
independent, which is the basic criterion of any refuge (Baum et al.,
2015). [They are cheaper and easier in engineering terms when compared
with Mars settlement]{.underline}.

A **[[space refuge would not be able to cope with
current]{.mark}ly-occurring [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, e.g.
overpopulation and climate change. [Human overpopulation can be limited
only on Earth by terrestrial policy and, if this can be done, no space
base is necessary]{.underline}. If it is not possible, then no space
base can solve this problem. For example, [space settlement is not able
to alleviate **global warming**]{.underline}, against Milligan's
suggestion. [The unique way to do that on Earth is to reduce methane
emission and/or to cool Earth by turning sunlight into space, as Solar
Radiation Management proposes]{.underline} (Farquhar et al., 2017).
There is only indirect, not direct applicability of space exploration.
For instance, space technology might be applied to cope with asteroid
impact or increasing the Sun temperature (Crawford). But these
[[exogenous catastrophes caused by **cosmic events** ]{.mark}**are
[unlikely in lifespan of]{.mark} current and [future
generations]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Tegmark & Bostrom, 2005, p. 754),
[and for this reason they oﬀer poor incentive for human space
program]{.underline}. The unique rationale for space refuge mission
could be future development of the Sun which will be getting more and
more warmer in next billions years. But [this threat does not justify
human space settlement due to its high risk and high
costliness]{.underline} (Jebari, 2015).

#### Extinction isnt inevitable as long as we don't rely on [unrealistic optimism]{.underline} and [short term solutions]{.underline}

Jody **Berger, 19** (Jody Berger is a writer for Stanford Earth
magazine, citing Steve Luby, MD, an epidemiologist and the director of
research for Stanford's Center for Innovation in Global Health,
2-19-2019, accessed on 12-20-2021, Stanford Earth, \"What\'s likely to
cause human extinction -- and how can we avoid it?\",

As part of the center's Planetary Health lecture series, [[Luby gave a
talk titled]{.mark}, "**[Can our]{.mark} collective [efforts avert
imminent]{.mark} human [extinction]{.mark}?**"]{.underline}

[In the end, [Luby comes down firmly on the side of **yes**]{.mark}, we
can. [But]{.mark} along the way and **[without intervention]{.mark}**,
the [future]{.mark} [looks]{.mark} pretty
[**grim**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[By 2100]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a
short 81 years in the future -- [[he sees three potential outcomes:
**human extinction**]{.mark}, the [collapse of civilization]{.mark} with
limited survival, [or a **thriving human society**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The first two outcomes could be the result of population growth coupled
with the increasing destruction of our planet.

[The growth in global population follows a flat line for most of human
history and then]{.underline}, at the turn of the industrial revolution,
[the line shifts to nearly vertical]{.underline} -- like a hockey stick
-- as the population explodes. The same shape show growth in technology
and innovation --flat for thousands of years and then suddenly germ
theory, telephones, airplanes and the internet, all within a few hundred
years.

[Sadly, a graph showing the [**increasing destruction** of our
environment]{.mark} would have the same shape and [would lead to our
**demise**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"[Without a thriving biosphere, there is no human future]{.underline},"
Luby said.

[[Also]{.mark} threatening that future]{.underline}? Our [[recently
acquired abilities]{.mark} to destroy each other [with
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}** [and **lethal
synthetic**]{.mark} **[biology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As an example,
[CRISPR]{.underline}, a gene-editing technology, could be a force for
good used to help eradicate disease or it [could potentially be used to
cause harm, such as by genetically modifying bird flu to become
airborne]{.underline}. And, as Luby sees it, "There's no shortage of
sociopaths."

[[Potential danger]{.mark} also [lurks in]{.mark} the **[acceleration of
a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**. [AI]{.mark} [doesn't need to
turn evil, just competent, to threaten a]{.mark} [human
future]{.mark}]{.underline}, Luby said. As an example, [a machine that
is indifferent to human survival could be programmed to create as many
paperclips as possible]{.underline}. [It may decide to transform the
entire biomass into paperclips]{.underline}, he said.

To stick around and survive all these hazards, [[humans need to become
more than competent at **looking past our own
biases**]{.underline}]{.mark}, he said. [**[Short-term thinking,
unrealistic optimism]{.mark}** and the **search for a
panacea**]{.underline} --- the Greek goddess of universal remedies ---
**[[won't]{.mark} [ensure a thriving future]{.mark}]{.underline}.**

### SSA ADV\-\--SC Bad\-\--AT: Asteroids

**No asteroids [impact]{.underline}**

Mike **Wall 16** (Mike Wall has been writing for Space.com since 2010.
His book about the search for alien life, "Out There," was published on
Nov. 13, 2018. Before becoming a science writer, Michael worked as a

But, mission officials stressed, that [[chance]{.mark} is
**[slim]{.mark}**, and the **space [rock]{.mark}** is [not]{.mark}
nearly **[big enough]{.mark}** to pose an **existential threat** to the
**planet**]{.underline}, despite what some media reports claimed over
the weekend. \[Potentially Dangerous Asteroids (Images)\] \"[We\'re [not
talking about]{.mark} an [**asteroid** that could **destroy the
Earth**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" OSIRIS-REx principal investigator Dante
Lauretta, of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of
Arizona, told Space.com. \"[We\'re not anywhere near that kind of
**energy** for an **impact**]{.underline}.\" SAMPLING AN ASTEROID If all
goes according to plan, the \$800 million OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral
Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer)
mission will lift off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from
Florida\'s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Sept. 8. The spacecraft
will spend two years chasing Bennu down, finally rendezvousing with the
near-Earth asteroid in August 2018. OSIRIS-REx will then study the space
rock from orbit for another two years before grabbing at least 2.1
ounces (60 grams) of surface material in July 2020. In 2023, this
relatively hefty sample should make it back to Earth, where researchers
in laboratories around the globe will analyze the material in a number
of ways. The mission team is chiefly interested in learning the role
that asteroids like Bennu --- dark, primitive and apparently carbon-rich
objects --- may have played in helping life get a foothold on Earth,
Lauretta said. \"Did these kinds of bodies deliver organic material and
water, in the form of hydrated minerals like clays, to the surface of
our planet that created the habitability and the environments that may
have led to the origin of life?\" Lauretta said. \"That\'s the prime
mission,\" to investigate that question, he added. There are secondary
objectives as well, including learning more about the valuable resources
that Bennu-like asteroids may harbor, Lauretta said. And then there\'s
the planetary-defense angle, which has gotten a lot of attention in the
last few days. A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS ASTEROID Bennu is officially
classified as a potentially dangerous asteroid. In fact, [there\'s an
[0.037 percent]{.mark}]{.underline} (or 1-in-2,700) [[chance]{.mark}
that [it will **strike Earth**]{.mark} in the last quarter of the 22nd
century]{.underline}, NASA scientists have calculated. Specifically,
that\'s the probability that, during an Earthy flyby in 2135, Bennu will
hit a special orbit-altering \"keyhole\" that will send it on a
collision course with the planet later in the century. OSIRIS-REx will
help scientists refine those odds, by refining their understanding of
Bennu\'s orbit. (That orbit, by the way, is already the best-known of
any asteroid, Lauretta said; thanks to extensive observations since
Bennu\'s 1999 discovery, astronomers have nailed the space rock\'s
orbital radius down to within 20 feet, or 6 m.) \"[Our
[uncertainties]{.mark} will [shrink]{.mark}, so that will [allow us to
recalculate]{.mark} the **[impact probability]{.mark}**]{.underline},\"
Lauretta said. \"We don\'t know which direction it\'ll go. It could go
down, because we just eliminated a bunch of possible keyholes that Bennu
may hit. Or it may go up, because in the area that\'s left we have a
higher concentration of keyholes compared to the overall area of the
uncertainty plane.\" OSIRIS-REx\'s work will also help researchers
better understand the Yarkovsky effect, which describes how absorbed
sunlight, when radiated away as heat, affects an object\'s trajectory.
Such information will improve knowledge not only of where Bennu is
headed, but where it came from, Lauretta said. But to focus on where
it\'s headed---what if Bennu does hit one of those keyholes in 2135, and
the space rock squares Earth up for an impact in 2185 or thereabouts?
What should humanity expect? [Such an impact would likely devastate the
local area but fall short of wiping out **civilization** or **causing a
mass extinction**]{.underline}, experts have said. [Astronomers estimate
that a space rock must be at least 0.6 miles]{.underline} (1 kilometer)
[wide to cause a global catastrophe]{.underline}. (For perspective: The
asteroid thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs---or at least to have
finished them off---was probably about 6 miles, or 10 km, across.) [But
an [impact]{.mark} would [not]{.mark} be
**[inevitable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even if Bennu had Earth in its
sights. [[Given]{.mark} a decade or so worth of **[lead
time]{.mark}**]{.underline}, researchers say, [an incoming [asteroid
could]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[be **nudged off course**
using]{.mark} fly-along \"**[gravity tractor]{.mark}**\"
**[probes]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}/or \"**[kinetic impactors]{.mark}**.\"
And if time is not on humanity\'s side, [there\'s always the **nuclear
option**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

6\. Public opinion [[**Public opinion** is]{.underline}]{.mark}, at
least [in the near future, the [**main sponsor** of]{.mark}]{.underline}
space research and [[space exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bertrand,
Pirtle, and Tomblin, (2017) show that [the public is interested
in]{.underline} human mission to Mars. The most preferred [space
mission]{.underline} is a **[crew in orbit]{.underline}** [and a robot
mission]{.underline} on Mars surface. In other words, [[**public
criteria**]{.mark} is **[low risk]{.mark} and low cost**]{.underline}.
The German space agency follows public opinion and social interest
because is focused on duty for society and oriented to social purposes
as "climate change, mobility, communication and security" (Zypries,
2017). [[Politicians are prone to]{.mark} **reduce** **space budgets**
or to [**not invest** in]{.mark} long-term human [**settlement
missions** due to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[public
opinion]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Consequently, progress in space
technology is still ~~retarded~~ \[slow\]. State of art in space
transport means did not change qualitatively since the Space Race
between the US and the Soviet Union. Impact of public opinion may differ
in various countries. Max Grimard (2012), p. 6) shows how important is
space program for public opinion in the US. Public sympathy for American
presence in space is counterbalanced by the unpredictability of
politician authorities, the tensions between presidents and the Congress
(Grimard, 2012, p. 12), and the important role played by competition
with Russia and China (Grimard, 2012, p. 6). Grimard adds that
**[Russia]{.underline}** is similar case but it [is]{.underline}
currently entire [focused on]{.underline} stability of space programs,
including [**renovation** of old infrastructure than on new
space]{.underline} exploration [programs]{.underline}. According to
Grimard (2012), p. 13), [this]{.underline} fact
**[excludes]{.underline}** [Russia from being the leader of
international collaboration in space policy despite its historical
advantages. **China**]{.underline}, according to Grimard,
**[repeats]{.underline}** [space policies of the]{.underline}
**[US]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Soviet Union]{.underline}**.
By contrast, [in]{.underline} **[Japan and Europe]{.underline}**,
[prestige does not play role. Japan and Europe are focused on scientific
and technological contexts. [Space]{.mark} program [is not]{.mark} a
[part of national policy]{.mark}. [Due to]{.mark} its]{.underline}
[[**costs**, politicians]{.mark} may [decide to **not risk
negative**]{.mark} **approach of [public opinion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
But public opinion does not threaten private investors which can
consider space as object of their investment. 7. Commercial exploration
of space is not a workable alternative [Risk of funding the wall might
be]{.underline} **[avoided]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} **[commercial
exploration]{.underline}** of space (Crawford, 2016). According to
Crawford, some space projects such as next generation of large
telescopes or crewed mission to Mars are non-profitable. While they are
a governmental duty, they could be funded partially by profits from
commercial exploration of space (for instance, space mining). [[Hope for
private exploration]{.mark} sounds reasonable but
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[counterbalanced]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline}]{.mark} [**commercial [focus on profits]{.mark}**.
Because mission to Mars has only scientific profits, **only public
sponsors** will be invested in this project]{.underline}. James S. J.
Schwartz (2014) adds that two of the possible reasons for human space
mission, such as improving human welfare and progress in scientific
exploration, are well beyond interests of private companies. Newman and
Williamson (2018) quite similarly expect that private space exploration
will be focused on financial profits more than on environmental
sustainability. [[Private investors are not obliged to act
altruistically]{.mark} and to sacrifice their business for uncertain
idea.]{.underline} W. Henry Lambright (2017) adds that [[private
companies]{.underline}]{.mark} at least [at]{.underline} **[first
stages]{.underline}** [of Mars space program [will not be able to fund
it]{.mark}. For this reason, [Mars]{.mark} space program [requires
**multi-generational effort**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[and]{.underline} **[political stabilization]{.underline}**.
[The challenge of]{.underline} **[safety]{.underline}** [works against
private investors]{.underline} in space program. Public space agencies
have achieved high standards of safety. They behave in careful and
conservative ways. [Commercial, private projects do not have the same
**advanced tech**]{.underline}nology, [the large number of]{.underline}
**[scientists]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**support staff**,
and]{.underline} the [**generous budgets**. **Catastrophe**]{.underline}
[would]{.underline} likely **[break]{.underline}** [a private space
program. The [lack of experience]{.mark} of private companies in space
exploration [is]{.mark} partially responsible for [higher risk
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}nological
**[[failures]{.underline}]{.mark}** even in relatively easy tasks as
crash of Momo-2 rocket launched by Japanese start-up on 30 June 2018
several seconds after launch. [This does not mean that [private
investors are]{.mark} not able to explore space, but they [are able to
do that **only** when]{.mark}]{.underline} [[they]{.underline}
**[receive profits]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. In scenario of commercial
exploration of space, we should wait for some point in the future when a
human space base appears as byproduct of **commercial
activity**]{.underline}. A human base on Mars might be a by-product of
hotels on LEO or space mining. Some investors who want to build space
hotels may try to settle space regions beyond LEO and build hotels on
the Moon and/or Mars. From touristic point of view, staying in the Moon
or Mars hotel may be more attractive than on LEO. Investors working in
asteroid mining may extend their business to the Moon and/or Mars. Both
enterprises even if focused on purely commercial purposes, will not be
easy (perhaps impossible) to achieve by private companies alone. Elvis
(2012), p. 549) argues that asteroid mining will be challenging due to,
among others, difficulties in detection of appropriate asteroids. He
shows that among about 1200 analyzed meteorites only 13 of them contain

that NASA should reorient its strategy from focus on exploration to
support for commercial utilization of space. Exploration will appear as
a consequence of commercial profitable activity (Elvis, 2012, p. 549).

so-called the paradox of technological progress discussed in the last
section, [[further]{.mark} putative [progress in space

**anthropogenic risks**]{.mark}]{.underline} including, among others,
overpopulation and limited resources (these anthropogenic threats are
unavoidable in near future, in contrast to other risks that are only
more or less probable but not unavoidable). Permanent lack of strong
rationale for human mission to Mars -- both now and in the near future
-- leads to paradoxical situation. [**[Even if]{.mark}** in some point

from]{.mark} these kinds of [risks]{.mark} that are [**rooted** in
**their way of thinking**, **style of life**, and **population

human species can try to protect against natural disaster but not
against deleterious effects of its own technological progress. In regard
to possible future existential risks, I assume that their deleterious
power is a little bit exaggerated, and, in any event, human space
settlement is not a right way to cope with them. However, in any case,
it is hard to speculate if any human space settlement must repeat the
same path of human expansion as it was the case on Earth. It is unclear
if human technological expansion and exploration must always lead to
deleterious and self-destructive effects. In this paper, I do not
discuss ethical and moral concerns which are traditionally considered
when discussing the human place in space. They include such topics as
the human right to explore space (it means both right to intervene in
any extraterrestrial object, and human duty and rationale for space
expansionism, mostly in the context of the idea of space refuge and
possible catastrophic scenarios on Earth), or the value of human life
and space objects.

In its 2018 'vision', the US Cyber Command built implicitly on the
dominant intelligence norm. Here, the objective is to become more agile
and act as close to the adversary as possible ('defend forward').70 The
United States considers 'constant contact' and 'persistent engagement'
as the necessary guiding principles to achieve superiority in cyberspace
and to take full advantage of the broader potential for pursuing its
political objectives through cyberspace. During the 2018 US midterm
elections, for example, the US Cyber Command worked closely with the NSA
to disrupt servers operated by the Russian Internet Research Agency
aiming to spread fake news and stir up tension in the United States.71
More recently, the US Cyber Command responded with various cyber effects
against Iran after the Iranian Revolutionary Guards apparently placed
mines on ships in the Strait of Hormuz.72 These practices illustrate
that, for the United States, cyber effects provide political options
when one does not want to escalate existing tensions into military
confrontation. Defensive coordination between allies through CYOC
supports such defensive use of cyber effects, increasing the possibility
that US Cyber Command will be allowed to 'defend forward' and work
persistently through allied networks.73 [A [more
**cyber-active**]{.mark} **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, [risks
being [**counterproductive** to]{.mark} the [ambition]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} '[[**defend** **forward**]{.underline}]{.mark}'
[[through allied]{.mark} [networks]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Unintended [**conflict escalation** from]{.mark} ongoing [cyber]{.mark}
activity is]{.underline} mainly [a [risk if]{.mark} [military]{.mark}

### Misc\-\--Turkey-Russia Space Collab

#### Turkey is collaborating with Russia [now]{.underline} on space tech to [piss off]{.underline} NATO.

"Regional rivalries and Nato tensions -- defining Turkey's military
space ambitions",

Over the past decade, [Turkey has launched its defense industry into the
space domain]{.underline}, in an attempt [to match the **fast-developing
capabilities** of its]{.underline} regional and global
[counterparts]{.underline}. The oft used term 'space race' does not
represent global industrial activities in the domain, but it does hint
at the growing pressure for countries who previously were not involved
in extra-terrestrial activities to catch up and participate. Turkey's
goals include a plan for a hard landing of a domestically produced
rocket on the moon by 2023, with a soft landing and rover launch by
2028, the construction of a Turkish space port, and plans to send a
Turkish citizen to the ISS.

Madeline Wild, Associate Defense Analyst, comments: "[Turkey's ambitious
aim]{.underline} to have launched a rocket that can reach the moon by
2023 reflects the overall nature of its space program. Rather than
purely being necessitated by the desire for sovereign use and control of
satellites, it [revolves around the **power** and **political
superiority** that **headline grabbing achievements**]{.underline} (such
as reaching the moon) [can bring]{.underline}. The introduction of
Turkey's space program in 2021 came shortly after Turkey's longtime
rival the UAE, announced that its space probe had entered Mars' orbit.
President Erdogan's speech in February 2021, launched the Turkish space
program and reinforced the geopolitical importance of the space program,
much of which was rhetorically charged with ideas of domain leadership
and the 'space race'.

"Last year NATO made space the fifth domain to be covered by the
collective security principles set out in the organizations charter.
Subsequently it is unsurprising that members such as Turkey are boosting
their space programs, in order to fulfil their commitments in the event
of any potential incident in this domain. This will have been noted by
TUA, the Turkish Space Agency, but [it will **not** be the desire to
uphold NATO's **collective security principle** driving Turkish space
development]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, [Turkey's fractious
relationship with certain NATO members will fuel **the desire** to
become a **regional leader** in the domain]{.underline}."

Wild continues: "In the Strategic Plan 2019-2023, Turkey set out its
aims to produce and procure 75% of all goods domestically by 2023. In
order to do so whilst still meeting its space related targets, Turkey's
aerospace industry will have to rapidly upskill. Whilst Turkey will
benefit from the fact that its domestic industry (namely state-owned
company Rokestan) has already launched a sounding rocket, much of the
current space activities are reliant on international cooperation. For
example, US-based SpaceX is currently responsible for the launch of
Turkish satellites, Türksat 5A being the most recent of these. Elon Musk
and President Erdogan have had direct communication to discuss future
cooperation and collaboration."

"[Turkey is]{.underline} also [collaborating with **Russia** on
**space-based tech**]{.underline}nology, [a move which could
**heighten**]{.underline} already [**tense relationships** between
**NATO** and the Black Sea state]{.underline}. [Russia will help Turkey
construct two launch platforms]{.underline}, one on land and one on sea.
This [forms part of a **wider package** of **defense cooperation**
between the states]{.underline}, [after the US **denied** the sale of
the **F-35** to Turkey]{.underline}, pushing President Erdogan further
into the President Putin's sphere of influence."

There is a [conflict]{.underline} at present [between the military's

clearly **[emphasizes diplomacy]{.mark}** to promote space
security]{.underline}. To this end, Washington ought to take concrete
steps toward securing a moratorium on debris-producing anti-satellite
testing and advocating transparency for proximity operations in orbit.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should signal to Russia
and China that it]{.underline} truly [seeks solutions to space security
problems]{.underline}, [rather than only portraying Moscow and Beijing
as destabilizing space actors]{.underline}. At the same time, the
Department of Defense and the intelligence community need to invest more
in capabilities that will increase the resiliency of national security
space systems.

An examination of [Cold War American and Soviet space activities reveals
that **[restraint]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [even when faced with
increasingly sophisticated space threats]{.underline}, [[promoted
**security**]{.mark} [and **stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Deviation]{.mark} from this policy]{.underline} in the 1980s
[[became]{.mark} a [source of]{.mark} **substantial [tension]{.mark}**
between]{.underline} the [superpowers]{.underline} in the final decade
of the Cold War. The lessons of this period, therefore, are important
for considering how the United States should approach space security as
the number of actors and threats continues to expand.

U.S. Space Strategy from the Cold War to the Present

U.S. government claims that only recently has space become contested,
and that Beijing and Moscow are the main drivers behind space
insecurity, overlook the realities of the Cold War and its legacy.
Policy analysts oftentimes argue that the United States was pursuing a
policy of space as a sanctuary through the early 1970s. The word
"sanctuary" was not, however, officially used until the mid-1970s, and
this term can obscure the nuances of U.S. views on space security.
According to noted space historian Walter McDougall, American space
policy emphasized its peaceful "rather than explicitly non-military'
purposes."

An overriding concern of the Dwight Eisenhower administration was
establishing the principle of freedom of space (i.e., having ability to
overfly foreign territory from space without it being considered a
violation of sovereignty). Promoting this concept was especially
critical because the U.S. government needed reconnaissance satellites to
peer behind the Iron Curtain to gather intelligence on the Soviet Union.
With the first successful launch of a U.S. photographic reconnaissance
satellite in August 1960, the majority of what U.S. intelligence knew
about Soviet and Chinese ground military forces was "attributable to
satellite intelligence." Consequently, peace in space was essential for
the viability of space reconnaissance.

Despite the emphasis on peaceful intent, the U.S. military did conduct
the world's first anti-satellite test in 1959, in addition to
high-altitude nuclear detonations that reached into space. Space
historian Asif Siddiqi has shown that early U.S. anti-satellite
activities served as the "first major catalyst for the Soviet
anti-satellite program." The John F. Kennedy administration furthermore
approved a very limited nuclear anti-satellite capability called Program
437 that was designed to defend against a Soviet nuclear orbital
bombardment system. At this point, American anti-satellite weapons were
believed to be a necessary hedge against the perceived Soviet orbital
nuclear threat, and U.S. officials de-emphasized anti-satellites in U.S.
public diplomacy on space. By the early 1970s, Program 437 was placed in
a limited operating status. More expansive U.S. military anti-satellite
proposals, like Project Spike (a non-nuclear air-launched anti-satellite
concept), were also denied. Space security expert Clay Moltz has argued
that "military-space restraint became institutionalized during the
1962-1975 period."

It became clear in the early 1970s that the Soviet Union's
anti-satellite weapon was increasingly sophisticated. The consensus
among U.S. officials was that a new U.S. anti-satellite would not,
however, have a deterrent effect or enhance the survivability of
American satellites. Strategic restraint was still the overriding
objective. This situation changed in the Gerald Ford administration.
With détente crumbing and tensions on the rise between Washington and
Moscow, Ford endorsed the idea that "treating space as a sanctuary,
\[was\] neither enforceable nor verifiable." As a result of this, he
approved a new anti-satellite program, not to respond to the Soviet
Union's anti-satellite, but rather to be able to destroy Soviet
satellites used to support tactical military operations.

The Jimmy Carter administration was convinced that arms control overrode
the military arguments in favor of a new anti-satellite. Furthermore,
Carter himself believed that restraint was necessary but only possible
if the Soviet government agreed to constrain its own anti-satellite
program. The president wanted to secure a comprehensive ban on
anti-satellites and he used the U.S. anti-satellite effort to place
greater pressure on the Kremlin. There were nevertheless significant
concerns about being able to verify an anti-satellite ban, but Carter
maintained that important steps, like a "hostile acts" agreement and
anti-satellite testing moratorium, could reduce tensions. These talks
fell apart, however, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

President Ronald Reagan believed that strategic restraint in space
hampered U.S. national security interests. He endorsed using
anti-satellites for space control, (i.e., having the ability to deny
adversaries the use of space). Reagan also created U.S. Space Command,
which was eliminated in 2002 and then revived in 2019. He even
considered a separate military service for space. Most significantly,
his Strategic Defense Initiative --- a program for a missile defense
system with land, sea, air, and space components --- called for the
permanent deployment of weapons in space. Because a ban on
anti-satellites would have limited the development of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, the Reagan White House eschewed space weapons arms
control with the Soviet Union. In 1985, the United States destroyed,
moreover, an American satellite in space using its miniature homing
vehicle anti-satellite system.

Much like President Donald Trump's space ideas, Reagan's were met with
skepticism by many senior officials in the national security
establishment. Even though Reagan's military space agenda did not come
to fruition, it signaled that U.S. strategic restraint in space was not
necessarily a permanent state of affairs. As a consequence, Russia began
developing systems like its Avangard hypersonic missile in response to
the Strategic Defense Initiative.

By the end of the Cold War, there was a growing group of space zealots
who advocated the expanded use of spacepower to achieve military goals.
These space advocates wanted to use space systems for power projection,
deterrence, and offensive action, rather than just military support. The
collapse of the Soviet Union, however, largely re-instated a U.S.
emphasis on restraint in space. The United States did continue research
into anti-satellites and missile defense, but both were significantly
scaled down. Additionally, by 1990, the United States began to
officially recognize that debris-producing anti-satellite tests were
highly problematic.

The post-Cold War lull in space security concerns did not last long.
After the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite test that produced significant
debris, the United States shot down one of its own satellites using a
Standard Missile-3. Even though this was not a dedicated anti-satellite
capability, Washington demonstrated once again that it had the means to
execute offensive action against satellites. The Chinese test in
particular contributed to the establishment of President Barack Obama's
policy that identified space as increasingly congested, contested, and
competitive. Since that time, U.S. concerns about space have only grown.
Despite the increased anxiety about space security since 2007 in
particular, the United States has still, on the whole, exercised
restraint in its pursuit of anti-satellite weapons capabilities and has
primarily focused on non-kinetic electronic warfare systems.

The [creation of the U.S. Space Force]{.underline}, while officially a
response to adversary behavior in orbit, [has not adequately furthered
U.S. and allied interests in space]{.underline}. On the positive side,
the new service has placed greater attention on the importance of space
systems and the requirement to address their vulnerabilities, in
addition to the need to streamline U.S. defense space acquisition. [It
has]{.underline} also, however, [created a lobby for the pursuit of
**military space superiority**]{.underline}, [which is]{.underline}
poorly defined, not easily measurable, and
**[destabilizing]{.underline}**.

Toward a New U.S. Strategy for Space Security

At present, [security challenges in space are only becoming more
complex]{.underline}, but U.S. space strategy is not postured to promote
security and stability. [The [Biden]{.mark} administration [should
**restrain**]{.mark} U.S. military [goals that]{.mark}
[emphasize]{.mark} **offensive action** and
**[superiority]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The space lessons of the Cold War
suggest that a [continued [emphasis on space superiority]{.mark} will
only [lead to]{.mark} a [more]{.mark} [**intense** **military-space
competition**]{.mark} [with Moscow]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. objective should be the
promotion of strategic stability primarily through diplomatic
engagement. The Department of Defense should focus on measures to
increase the resiliency of U.S. space systems and thereby reduce
vulnerabilities. As Heather Venable has argued, the Space Force in
particular should focus on traditional missions (i.e., space support
functions) rather than "futuristic views of spacepower employment."

In the immediate term, the United States should change the way it talks
about space security. Senior leaders ought to stop making ahistorical
statements like "over the past five years, space has become contested."
These factually incorrect declarations, which are repeated time and time
again, make Space Force leadership look out of touch with reality.
Additionally, accusing Beijing and Moscow of having "weaponized space"
ignores how U.S. actions have contributed to space insecurity. Strategic
messaging needs to emphasize U.S. intent to promote security and
stability in space rather than military space superiority, which would
be especially difficult to achieve given the threat environment and
might be impossible to measure. Most importantly, there needs to be
greater attention on establishing norms of behavior that promote
security in the space domain through diplomatic engagement.
Consequently, the State Department ought to play a much more prominent
role in promoting U.S. national security space interests, both in terms
of messaging and foreign engagement to secure a more stable situation in
space.

In 2020, the Pentagon released its Defense Space Strategy. This document
identifies space as a "distinct warfighting domain" along with the need
to maintain "superiority" in space. It falls short in several key areas.
It does not, for instance, effectively explain how the United States is
going to deter adversary activity in space or how it is going to be
capable of "winning wars that extend into outer space." In 2019, when he
was still chief of staff of the Air Force, Gen. David Goldfein talked
about the need to be able to "hit back \[in space\]." Similar references
to offensive action have been made by other officials without any
specific details regarding capabilities.

It is very well possible that senior military leaders believe that these
statements about potential offensive action enhance space deterrence.
This idea is not, however, compelling, at least in part due to the
asymmetry in dependence on space between the United States and its
adversaries. In 1972, Amrom Katz, a RAND Corporation analyst who was an
expert on strategic reconnaissance, argued that a U.S. anti-satellite
would not have a deterrent effect, which was a view shared by Brent
Scowcroft, Ford's national security advisor. Scowcroft believed that,
since the United States was still considerably more dependent than the
Soviet government on space, an anti-satellite weapon would not have
deterrent value. Thinking only in terms of space deterrence is too
limited anyway. British space security expert Bleddyn Bowen warns
against the danger of "adhering too narrowly to the concept of 'space
deterrence' \[which\] can mislead analysis to isolate space from Earth."
Any space deterrent proposals, therefore, should be placed within a
larger deterrence framework.

Many U.S. diplomats agreed during the Cold War that even rhetoric about
offensive strikes in space could be destabilizing. Similarly, a 2010
RAND study stated that

a national space policy more conducive to deterring attacks on U.S.
space systems would avoid provocative rhetoric about denying others the
use of space and would, instead, explicitly condemn any use of force to,
from, or in that domain, except in retribution for attacks on one's own
space systems.

Consequently, bellicose language about military action in space should
be excised from official U.S. government pronouncements on space policy.

The Defense Space Strategy does identify the need to promote "favorable
standards and norms of behavior in space." This statement, however,
raises the following question: favorable standards according to whom? In
February, Maj. Gen. DeAnna Burt, the commander of U.S. Space Command's
combined force space component, announced that the United States is
going to take a more direct role in establishing norms of behavior in
space. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also said that the United
States will focus "on developing standards and norms of responsible
behavior in outer space." The ability of the Department and Defense, the
State Department, and the intelligence community to arrive at a
consensus on the details of norms development will, however, be a
substantial challenge. Despite the policy obstacles, it is in the U.S.
interest to take a leading role in working with international partners
to define norms of behavior in two especially important areas:
rendezvous and proximity operations, and debris generation. Defining
limits and constraints for both can significantly promote greater
stability among spacefaring nations.

Rendezvous and proximity operations involve one satellite getting close
to another for a wide variety of benign or potentially hostile reasons.
For example, satellites are being developed to service and repair
malfunctioning space systems. Additionally, the same techniques for
benign proximity operations can be used to carry out observation of
other countries' satellites or to attack them. According to space
security expert Brian Weeden, "any time you have militaries operating
near each other without a lot of transparency or clarity \[there is\]
the opportunity for misperceptions that could lead to something very
bad."

The [U.S. government should determine]{.underline}, internally, [what it
should]{.underline} or should not [allow with regard to **proximity
operations**]{.underline} (i.e., how close is too close). Subsequently,
[the [State Department]{.mark} [should determine]{.mark} if the
**[identified limits]{.mark}** would be acceptable to]{.underline} other
spacefaring nations, especially [China and Russia]{.underline}. [There
is [going to be]{.mark} [**resistance** to]{.mark} [defining]{.mark}
[constraints]{.mark}]{.underline}, out of fear that it could box in
future U.S. military freedom of action, [but the [threat of not doing
so]{.mark} is **[even]{.mark} [greater]{.mark}**]{.underline} because a
mishap involving two military spacecraft of different nationalities
could lead to a crisis. [[**Even if** Beijing]{.mark} [and
Moscow]{.mark} **[resist]{.mark} defining limits**]{.underline}, then
[the]{.underline} [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can use]{.underline}]{.mark} its own
[[proposed]{.mark} [boundaries]{.mark} [to place **diplomatic
pressure**]{.mark} [on]{.mark} both [countries to
**cooperate**]{.mark}]{.underline} in developing an acceptable
framework.

Even more pressing than proximity operations is the problem of debris
generation. The 2007 Chinese and the 2019 Indian anti-satellite tests
demonstrated that testing kinetic weapons against objects in space can
create significant hazards. It is imperative therefore that the United
States leads the way in banning kinetic weapons tests against space
objects. The United States should, however, differentiate more clearly
between debris and non-debris producing tests. Comments by the U.S.
government on Russia's most recent anti-satellite tests highlight them
as destabilizing, but it should be noted that Moscow has not executed a
debris-producing anti-satellite test since the Cold War. Not making this
distinction only adds to current tensions in Washington's relationship
with Moscow. The primary focus needs to be on preventing tests that
produce debris. Placing restrictions on non-debris generating tests
would be especially difficult because there are too many dual-use
systems that are regularly tested (e.g., ground-based and sea-deployed
missile defense).

A common argument against arms control on kinetic anti-satellites is
that it won't be possible to verify. This is due to the fact that it is
relatively easy to hide offensive weapons on satellites and because so
many space systems are dual-use. A moratorium on anti-satellite testing
can, however, be verified. Debris cannot be hidden --- any test against
an object in space resulting in debris would be immediately detectable.
In light of this, the Biden administration should make a moratorium on
testing that generates debris in space a high-priority arms control
objective.

Diplomatic engagement is not the only solution to promoting greater
security in space. Resiliency of space systems and their supporting
architecture needs to be a high priority for the Department of Defense
and the intelligence community. This is both a technological and a
diplomatic task. Amrom Katz said over 30 years ago that the United
States was investing in satellites that were highly sophisticated, but
very few in number, and that had become a "juicy target" in space. The
U.S. government needs to continue to invest in more space systems that
are hardened for dealing with both physical and non-kinetic threats.
Anti-satellite countermeasures could involve protecting optical sensors
from directed energy weapons, employing decoys, and increasing satellite
maneuverability (among others). The United States can also invest in
proliferated low earth orbit constellations. This involves putting up
more satellites, which creates more targets and, therefore, increases
survivability. Additionally, more fully integrating allies into the U.S.
space architecture would be an important step toward ensuring the
resiliency of national security space systems that any American-led
coalition will need.

Finally, the United States needs to more thoroughly explore rapid
reconstitution capabilities (i.e., having the ability to launch new
systems quickly). This would also involve looking at alternative launch
facilities. The United States primarily relies on Vandenberg in
California and Cape Canaveral in Florida for launches, but, in the
1980s, for example, the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization
examined using submarines to launch satellites under the name Project
Janus. Examining new ways to be able to ensure access to space if
Vandenberg or Cape Canaveral become unusable due to a natural or
man-made catastrophe is essential. As more allies develop spaceports,
they too can provide support for launch resiliency.

Looking Ahead

The Space Force will likely remain intact with the Biden administration.
Certainly, space security challenges are only going to become more acute
as countries expand their civil and military activities in orbit.
Consequently, the Biden team should make substantial modifications to
the U.S. approach to space security. Its [overarching [space framework
should]{.mark} [emphasize]{.mark} **[diplomacy]{.mark}** to achieve a
more **stable** situation]{.underline}. Rather than just highlighting
what the U.S. government sees as destabilizing Russian and Chinese space
actions, the United States needs to take the initiative in developing
norms of behavior that can lead to a more secure space environment for
all nations. This [[different approach]{.mark} to space will
[require]{.mark} a **[less]{.mark} [militarized agenda]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} [gives]{.mark} a much more **[prominent]{.mark}
[role]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **[State Department]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} developing and implementing [U.S.]{.mark} national security
[space]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. It will also require a
return to emphasizing space support rather than offensive action.

While space systems have been enabling combat effects for several
decades, [there has never been a war that has extended into outer
space]{.underline}. It would be derelict on the part of the Pentagon not
to prepare for space warfare, but [it should not be treated as an
inevitability]{.underline}. The U.S. government should, therefore,
continue to pursue a more resilient space architecture, while
emphasizing diplomatic solutions to space security problems.
Additionally, the way in which U.S. space priorities are communicated is
especially important. Words matter and can have strategic consequences.
Messaging can promote deterrence, order, and stability, or it can lead
to chaos and crises. [The pursuit of stability through
**diplomacy**]{.underline}, [rather than **military
superiority**]{.underline}, [should be at the **heart** of U.S. national
security space strategy]{.underline} to better ensure that space
continues to be a conflict-free environment.
