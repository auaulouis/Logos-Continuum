Since its founding in 1973, [[the Office of Net Assessment]{.mark} (ONA)
[has]{.mark} continually [provided long-term comparative
assessments]{.mark} of trends, key competitions, risks, opportunities,
and future prospects of U.S. military capability to the Secretary of
Defense and Deputy Secretary of Defense.]{.underline} ONA's work is
conducted in accordance with written guidance by the Secretary of
Defense, as well as DOD Directive 5111.1. ONA's mission and worldview
have remained largely unchanged in its 40+ year history. ONA products
include internally-produced assessments which represent years of
detailed analysis. [[These assessments]{.mark} are highly classified,
tightly controlled in distribution, and [provide strategic-level
management]{.mark} insights for the Secretary of Defense and other
senior DOD leaders. Several such assessments have been completed since
2017. The office also produces and commissions shorter studies, less
formal assessments, and topical memos, to support its research or in
response to requests from the Secretary or senior DOD or Congressional
leadership]{.underline}. These studies include historical analysis,
alternative futures, and more speculative work about the possible
character of military conflict in the future. ONA research on the
character of future warfare since 2000 formed the diagnostic basis of
the most recent National Defense Strategy. An ONA-sponsored study helped
inform Congress' decision to reverse the Budget Control Act in 2017. [On
several occasions since 2016, ONA work has been used in briefings to the
President. Though the Department does not publicly disclose the entire
scope and nature of [ONA]{.mark}\'s research, the office [has produced
and distributed hundreds of unique works]{.mark} to individuals across
the U.S. government since 2015.]{.underline} ONA products, both
externally commissioned and internally written, are read by or briefed
to the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and Under Secretaries of Defense,
the Chairman and Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Combatant Commanders.
[[ONA work is]{.mark} also [shared widely]{.mark} with other government
agencies, including with the National Security Council staff, the
National Intelligence Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the
State Department]{.underline}.

[The art of [net assessment helped the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited

analysts including [Andrew
Marshall](https://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R862.html) and [Eliot

used it to identify points of leverage for U.S. strategy. [[In
the]{.mark} Cold War's [aftermath]{.mark}, [Andrew
Krepinevich's](https://issues.org/krepinevich/) outstanding [net
assessments revealed the emerging Revolution in Military Affairs and
its]{.mark} precision-guided [weapons regime]{.mark}.]{.underline} But
in the years since, net assessment has largely fallen into disuse as a
tool to publicly guide defense planning. As an approach that looks for
potential opportunities by holistically exploring a competition, net
assessment would seem well-suited to the combination of capable
adversaries and looming budget constraints facing the United States.
Yet, outside a few

The British Empire's withdrawal from the Indian subcontinent in 1947
left unresolved issues of statehood and borders --- and the Himalayan
frontiers of [[China, India and Pakistan]{.mark} have since formed a
persistent, unhealed wound. The three nations [have clashed in dozens of
confrontations]{.mark}, from full-scale, conventional wars to Himalayan
border skirmishes and armed standoffs, terrorist attacks or air strikes.
[India-Pakistan conflicts have escalated]{.mark} since Pakistani
terrorists [attacked
Mumbai](https://www.britannica.com/event/Mumbai-terrorist-attacks-of-2008)
in 2008, killing or injuring hundreds of Indians. The [India-China
border]{.mark} conflict [has flared]{.mark} since 2020, including its
worst violence [in 45
years](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/first-time-in-45-years-soldiers-lost-lives-on-india-china-border-850264.html)]{.underline}.
The risks of sudden violence in the region [were
dramatized](https://www.usip.org/node/146241) in March when India's
military accidentally launched an unarmed, supersonic missile 75 miles
into Pakistan. Luckily, the missile's crash killed no one, and it came
in a moment of relative calm in the two countries' volatile relations[.

of Indian troops to to that zone. While the rivalries, [periodic clashes
and armed capacity]{.mark} of the three nations [have sharpened over 15
years]{.mark}]{.underline}, policies to protect strategic stability
"didn't really move along with the changes," said [Vikram
Singh](https://www.usip.org/node/112856), an Asia security policy
specialist at USIP[. Fundamentally, "[there is]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n
absolute [lack of]{.mark} strategic [engagement]{.mark} among the three
powers [about how they would manage escalation]{.mark}," and rising
uncertainty about "how crises might spiral,"]{.underline} he said. "I
think what we've seen in Russia and Ukraine gives us reason to think
hard about the unthinkable." Singh [spoke at USIP alongside
others](https://www.usip.org/node/145661) among 19 Asia and nuclear
security specialists who conducted [the study, published this
week](https://www.usip.org/node/145701). The report analyzes recent
years' evolution of the conflicts and offers recommendations for U.S.
policymakers. "[[We see an evolution,]{.mark} both [in terms of the
capabilities]{.mark}" of the rival states, notably "more and different
types of weapons of technology," [and]{.mark} perhaps more importantly,
[in deteriorating relationships,]{.mark} "particularly between India and
China, and India and Pakistan]{.underline}," said [Daniel
Markey](https://www.usip.org/node/141261), a scholar and policy
practitioner on South Asia and USIP advisor. [[These]{.mark} evolutions
[lead]{.mark} "[to]{.mark} possibilities for even [the potential of
nuclear use]{.mark} in the region that are very worrisome,"]{.underline}
he said. Analysts from the USIP-convened [Senior Study Group on
Strategic Stability in Southern Asia](https://www.usip.org/node/146161)
discussed specific evolutions that are increasing the risks. One is that
[[China]{.mark} [is]{.mark} significantly [expanding its nuc]{.mark}lear
[arsenal]{.mark}, which is expected to reach "up to 700 deployed
warheads within the next five years,"]{.underline} said [Lynn
Rusten](https://www.nti.org/about/people/lynn-rusten/), who leads
efforts to reduce the dangers of nuclear weapons at the nonpartisan
[Nuclear Threat Initiative](https://www.nti.org/). [[Another problem
is]{.mark} that the return to power of Afghanistan's Taliban creates new
space for [violent extremist groups bent on attacking India]{.mark}
through Pakistan. [Such attacks have been a frequent trigger]{.mark} for
India-Pakistan military clashes. [Southern Asia has]{.mark} gradually
[become a theater of rival alliances]{.mark} --- between [the United
States and India]{.mark} [on one hand and China and Pakistan on the
other]{.mark}, [a polarization that has been accelerated by the global
strategic rivalry between China and the United
States]{.mark},]{.underline} noted [Yu n

Interoperability,\" United States Army Strategy Research Project,

[The EUCOM Posture Statement refers to the Joint Multinational Training
Center ([JMTC]{.mark}) in Grafenwohr, Germany as [a "strategic asset"
and the "linchpin for achieving vital theater objectives]{.mark} meeting
the comprehensive security cooperation mission".]{.underline} Further it
"enables a broad range of multinational training events that ensures
U.S. and partner nation forces are well-prepared\...for global
contingencies."42 [The Joint Multinational Readiness Center
([JMRC]{.mark}) at Hohenfels Germany, [subordinate to the JMTC, is the
U.S. military's only combat training center in
Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline} Located in eastern 18 Bavaria, it has been
a maneuver training center since 1938 when it was first used to train
German units preparing for combat. Since the 1950's, the JMRC trained
American infantry and armor maneuver battalions to combat the threat of
the Warsaw Pact. Most recently, the JMRC has hosted Maneuver Rehearsal
Exercises (MRXs) for units preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and
Iraq.43 These units have comprised a mix of NATO forces. Other training
exercises have included 1200 personnel from 18 different counties
conducting Operational Mentor Liaison Team (OMLT) and Police Mentor
Liaison Team (POMLT) training for deployment to Afghanistan.44 According
to Mr. Chris Irwin, the JMRC Protocol Officer, since 2005 the
installation alone has hosted over 170 foreign flag officers, Chiefs and
Ministers of Defense, and parliamentary level civilians. In that same
time representatives from nearly 50 countries visited the center to
observe some aspect of the training environment.45 [Although each visit
had a separate agenda [the number of foreign visitors demonstrates JMRCs
importance]{.mark} as America's allies strive [for]{.mark} greater
[interoperability]{.mark}. [A critical aspect]{.mark} of any training
event at the JMRC [is the feedback facilitated by the]{.mark} eight
Observer Controller ([OC]{.mark}) [Teams]{.mark} assigned to the
Operations Group]{.underline}. Each team is comprised of hand selected
American commissioned and non-commissioned officers who have
successfully served in tactical unit of the same type and size of the
organization they are tasked to observe. Feedback is provided to units
in the form of both informal and formal AARs and is designed to allow
the rotational unit to learn from their actions. [**[The goal is that a
unit]{.mark}, regardless of nationality, [departs]{.mark} the JMRC
[better trained]{.mark} than when it arrived [and prepared to fight and
win in]{.mark} a [combat]{.mark} zone.**]{.underline} The AAR is a
sensitive event: the unit members should feel that they can learn from
their 19 mistakes without feeling as if they are being belittled,
humiliated, or at risk of being relieved. It is particularly sensitive
for foreign armies who have not experienced AARs in the past. For the
AAR to be an effective learning tool requires rapport building and
proficiency across a broad range of technical and tactical skills. [[As
foreign units rotate]{.mark} through the training center [it]{.mark}
also [requires a greater degree of cultural empathy]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
an [understanding of foreign weapons and tactics]{.mark}. OCs develop
themselves professionally through interaction with rotational units and
through discussion with other officers and NCOs assigned to the center.
[Most OCs]{.mark} depart the JMRC to re-join regular Army units where
their [expertise often sets them apart]{.mark} from their
peers.]{.underline} Many OCs depart having initiated relationships with
their rotational counterparts that endure.46 **[[Currently OC teams are
comprised of only American personnel:]{.underline}]{.mark}** there are
limited opportunities for other countries to integrate into the existing
teams. [[To further develop interoperability]{.mark} and subject matter
expertise amongst our NATO allies [there needs to be **more
multinational representation**]{.mark} on the OC teams.]{.underline} [A
[gradual integration of our NATO allies]{.mark} into the teams
[would]{.mark} develop deeper understanding, cultural awareness, [and
ensure interoperability]{.mark} into the future. [It is also mutually
beneficial]{.mark} for the United States Army and any army that
participates: allied [officers]{.mark} and non-commissioned officers
[will leave the training center with a greater understanding of how to
integrate]{.mark} into the planning and execution process of the U.S.
Army. [The first phase]{.mark} of this integration [would assign NATO
officers to key billets]{.mark} within the organization. This would
include the Deputy Commander of the Operations Group, a position
normally held by an Army senior lieutenant colonel. This assignment
would place him as second in command of JMRC, and should be for a period
of not less than 2 years. [Integration would continue to the OC
teams]{.mark} where alliance officers would assume executive officer
positions, normally reserved for senior Army majors]{.underline}. Figure
2: Example of Key Position Integration. [[The second phase]{.mark} of
this integration [is the creation of a multi-national OC team]{.mark}
where American commissioned and non-commissioned officers man only half
of the authorized positions available. [Over time,]{.mark} as countries
see the benefit of this integration, [NATO officers and NCOs could fill
any position]{.mark} within any team. NATO observer controllers would
have the opportunity to develop lifelong relationships, understand the
complexities of developing training exercises, facilitate learning
through the AAR process, and gain greater understanding of operating in
a multinational force]{.underline}. 21 Figure 3: Example of Integrated
Maneuver Observer Controller Team. [**[Service]{.mark} as an OC**
**[should be recognized]{.mark} throughout NATO [as a career enhancing
assignment]{.mark}** for those selected. Attendance and successful
graduation from the required OC Training Academy training should serve
as NATO professional military education for junior officer and senior
non-commissioned officers. Two years of successful service on an OC team
should result in the award of a skill identifier and NATO qualification
badge. [Future assignments should, as much as feasible, include service
in NATO integrated units]{.mark} like those assigned to the NATO
Response Force (NRF). [Integration]{.mark} of the best officers and
non-commissioned officers by our NATO allies [into the existing
structure]{.mark} at JMRC [is a great investment in the future of NATO,
and **builds interoperability from the bottom up**]{.mark}**.** [This
investment]{.mark} of officers and NCOs]{.underline} 22 [demonstrates
commitment to the alliance that later [translates to resolve, trust, and
**more effective operations when deployed
together**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Technology not key to interoperability -- consensus and agreement first -- unified command structures solve best

[[Interoperability problems]{.mark} may [occur at all levels]{.mark} of
warfare---strategic, operational, tactical, and technological. [Military
planners tend to think of interoperability as a technical]{.mark} and
tactical [concern]{.mark}. However, [interoperability]{.mark} may
[also]{.mark} be [affected by disagreement over the political
objectives]{.mark} of a military operation,]{.underline} such as whether
to pursue total destruction of an adversary or some agreed-upon level of
damage to his forces. Problems at one level can affect interoperability
at other levels. For example, the absence of secure communication among
allies can increase the risk of aircraft attrition. This problem can
exacerbate political differences over the number of acceptable
casualties. [[Allies must recognize and address the fundamental
sources]{.mark} of interoperability problems. In cases where political
motives are misaligned, [no amount of technological improvement will
mitigate the problem.]{.mark}]{.underline} [For example, [in Somalia,
disagreement between allies over the purpose]{.mark} of the mission [led
to a chain of command that proved incapable of]{.mark} preventing or
[mitigating the consequences of a downed
helicopter]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Consensus]{.mark} at the strategic
and operational levels [will make]{.mark} tactical and technical
[problems less likely and easier to resolve]{.mark} when they
arise.]{.underline} Successful operations require flexible
organizational structures, doctrines, and procedures. [NATO
[allies]{.mark} often [face uncertainty]{.mark} about what missions will
be needed, which countries will participate, and what types of forces
each country will contribute. Potential **[disruptions]{.mark} in
interoperability [can be mitigated through a unified command structure
to coordinate the roles]{.mark} of various countries.** [Standing
organizations]{.mark} devoted to planning, training, and exercising
coalition forces [can provide continuity between
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. These elements should be lubricated by
the ready availability of liaison officers to overcome cultural and
linguistic barriers and to facilitate information flow between allies.
These case studies have supported PAF work to improve U.S.-NATO
interoperability in the areas of command, control, communications,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.

## Ukraine Intervention

#### The USFG should work with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to... - increase supplies to Ukraine while preventing escalation - establish a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace - bolster forward presence around Ukraine - take a strong nuclear deterrence posture towards Russia - increase economic sanctions against Russia

### Solvency - Russia

#### Plan is key to end Ukraine quickly and stop escalation

[Richard D. **Hooker**,
Jr.](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/richard-d-hooker-jr/),
4-21-20**22**, \"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation
in Ukraine and beyond,\" Atlantic Council,
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/managing-escalation-in-ukraine/>
GH-PJ

What can NATO and the European Union do to prevent Russia from
escalating the conflict to unacceptable levels? What follows are a few
principles to guide NATO's assessment of preventing and avoiding
escalation. [**Keep Ukraine in the fight.** The first, and most
immediate, curative is to keep Ukraine in the war. This means continued
financial assistance, shipments of lethal aid, and real-time
intelligence sharing, as well as humanitarian assistance and help with
absorption and resettlement of refugees.]{.underline} The United States
and Europe have shown unity and concerted action in responding swiftly
to Russian aggression in Ukraine and this must continue, even as Putin
seeks to find and drive wedges between transatlantic allies and
partners. [In this struggle, a coherent narrative, shared and
articulated in common, will be critical. In this regard, continuous
references to the [danger of escalation to "World War
III"](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-u-s-deterrence-failed-ukraine-putin-military-defense-11647794454)
and a steady drumbeat of measures not to be taken can only serve to
reassure Putin that he has a free hand in Ukraine]{.underline}. A degree
of strategic ambiguity and the possibility of US and NATO intervention
should he go too far can be helpful in moderating Russian excesses and
controlling escalation. [An "all measures on the table" approach will
force Russian planners to consider, and prepare for, multiple response
scenarios]{.underline}, complicating resource allocation and inducing
uncertainty. While deterrence is more art than science, signaling to
one's opponent that one is too frightened to engage is more likely to
encourage than to deter. [The most effective way to prevent spillover
onto NATO territory and other forms of future Russian aggression is to
[help defeat Russian forces in the field inside
Ukraine](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/ukraine-is-winning-war-russia/627121/).]{.underline}
[**Supplying Ukraine** with food, fuel, spare parts, and modern
equipment is the best way to do that, **while still avoiding direct
intervention by NATO.**]{.underline} This means combat aircraft, main
battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled and rocket
artillery, mobile air defense, secure radios, unmanned aerial vehicles,
target-acquisition radars, spare parts, and ammunition, including
precision-guided munitions. Many of these combat systems [exist in
storage](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sierra-army-depot) in great
numbers in the United States and in Europe. [The Ukrainian military has
shown remarkable versatility in adapting to unfamiliar systems such as
the Javelin and Stinger, but exportable training packages, and even
training sites in Europe for selected specialists, also warrant
consideration. **If NATO intervenes, do it decisively.**]{.underline}
[Several European nations, including Poland, Denmark, and Belgium, are
considering some form of ["peacekeeping"
intervention](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polands-kaczynski-calls-peacekeeping-mission-ukraine-2022-03-15/)
in Ukraine, while calls for a no-fly zone are mounting as the civilian
death toll rises]{.underline}. This suggests a critical mass of support
may be forming for outside intervention under certain circumstances.
Strong material and financial aid may enable Ukraine to hold on, and
even advance to retake occupied territory, but Russia remains a far
larger and stronger opponent. If the logic that it is better to defeat
Putin in Ukraine than on NATO territory is sound, intervention to
prevent the fall of Ukraine or its dismemberment must be considered. The
prospect of actual genocide of Ukrainian civilians, or use of weapons of
mass destruction, might also trigger NATO intervention. [This can take
several forms.]{.underline} [A no-fly zone would mean that NATO, or a
coalition of the willing, employs combat aircraft based outside Ukraine
to ground Russian military aviation, leaving ground combat to the
Ukrainians]{.underline} (an analogy is the Kosovo air campaign). Unified
command and control would be essential. The effort would fail if all
targets required approval by thirty nations, so allowing discretion to
military commanders acting within political guidance would be required.
All Russian aircraft entering Ukrainian airspace would be engaged.
Russian air defenses must be suppressed (perhaps even inside Russia),
forward air controllers must be embedded with ground units to prevent
fratricide, and target lists may be expanded quickly to include attack
of Russian missile and rocket systems that are destroying Ukrainian
cities. [A no-fly zone is, of course, an escalation itself, but one
intended to lead to a Russian defeat in Ukraine to prevent follow-on
aggression in Europe.]{.underline} Entering the conflict from the air is
a serious and sober step. Some aircrew would be lost. [Putin could
retaliate by launching ballistic missiles against Polish, Romanian, or
other European targets. To do so, however, would mean expanding the
conflict against a much stronger and wealthier NATO, at a point at which
almost all of Russia's available combat power is deployed in
Ukraine.]{.underline} Intervention from the air also provides a clear
firebreak. Introduction of large NATO ground forces would be an even
more dramatic step Russia would surely seek to avoid if possible.
[Introduction of "peacekeeping forces" or establishing a "[humanitarian
no-conflict
zone](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/why-nato-should-establish-a-humanitarian-no-conflict-zone-in-ukraine/?mkt_tok=NjU5LVdaWC0wNzUAAAGDV5I__mUy8Bvuqb528TF10EQUMRoQl3cbvKrCOqy2gfKr4APMKCqz3KcSj9Shugio412CYGt93rRXjzKS5__Y8fjP4PiS5bYEPNG8PfMwaA)"
in western Ukraine, use of NATO special forces and trainers, and
deployment of "niche" specialists with critical skills such as
communications, targeting, and computer-network defense are also forms
of intervention that could contribute to success in Ukraine. Unlike air
operations, however, these could make only marginal contributions that
may not be worth the added risk of bringing the Alliance into the
war.]{.underline} Should the campaign mature, and a no-fly zone
materialize, these additional measures could augment Ukraine's defense
in helpful ways, but they should not precede air intervention. Direct
intervention is a major step. It should not be undertaken except to
achieve a decisive result. **[Bolster forward presence.]{.underline}**
As a hedge against further Russian aggression and to reassure allies,
the US deployed two additional heavy brigades to Poland in February and
early March, along with an airborne brigade, bringing the US rotational
"heel-to-toe" brigade there to divisional strength. US divisional and
corps-level headquarters were also sent. The US 2nd Cavalry Regiment
based in Germany (actually a Stryker brigade) was relocated to Romania
at the same time. Additional air units and ground troops from a number
of allies have also been deployed to NATO's eastern flank, while the
forty-thousand-soldier NATO Response Force (NRF) has been alerted for
the first time in its history. [Putin's rhetoric and aggressive
disinformation and subversion efforts have, for years, targeted the
Baltic States, which stand between Kaliningrad and contiguous Russia and
extend almost to the suburbs of St. Petersburg. To forestall future
aggression and cement firm deterrence, these forces should remain in
eastern Europe at least for the near term]{.underline} (i.e., 3--5
years). As the campaign in Ukraine unfolds, Putin should understand
clearly that NATO is postured to respond strongly to further escalation.
For many years, [policymakers have [argued strenuously
against](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/Kuhn_Baltics_INT_final_WEB.pdf)
providing the Baltic States, and NATO's eastern flank in general, with
an adequate defense for fear of "provoking" Russia and to "maintain
Alliance unity." Measures to build up Ukraine's defensive capacity were
resisted for the same reasons; the Barack Obama administration opposed
lethal aid, even after the invasions of Crimea and the Donbas, while the
Donald Trump administration provided only a trickle. The invasion of
Ukraine has demonstrated the pitfalls of this thinking.]{.underline}
[Putin's threats were intended to keep his neighbors weak, but recent
events have proven that it is the perception of weakness, not strength,
that provokes him most.]{.underline} Accordingly, a [firm
defense](https://jamestown.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-to-Defend-the-Baltic-States-full-web4.pdf?x48497)
from the borders of Finnmark to the Black Sea can prevent spillover or
regional escalation, communicate resolve, and reassure host-nation
publics that the conflict in Ukraine will not land on their doorstep.
[This is under way with the recent announcement that NATO battlegroups
will be posted in [Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and
Slovakia](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2975977/stoltenberg-expects-nato-leaders-to-strengthen-alliance-posture/).
Meanwhile, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), Denmark, and others have
also pledged to increase their forces in the Baltic States. To further
strengthen deterrence and head off escalation, NATO should thoughtfully
consider how best to help the Baltic States help
themselves.]{.underline} Though proud members of the 2-percent club,
their small economies prevent them from acquiring the air defense and
heavy forces they need to deter future Russian aggression. [Estonia and
Latvia field only a single light brigade each, while Lithuania fields a
mechanized brigade with no tanks and a motorized brigade]{.underline}.
[Using security-assistance
funds](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10946) (such as
the European Deterrence Initiative), [the United States and NATO could
equip existing Baltic formations with modern tanks, self-propelled
artillery, and air defense from reserve stocks, along with the training,
spare parts, and ammunition needed to make them viable.]{.underline} The
Alliance should also strengthen the enhanced Forward Presence (eFP)
formations in the Baltic States, as Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg
has suggested](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193610.htm).
[These forces are too small to pose a credible offensive threat, but can
defend long enough for other NATO forces, such as the NRF and US armored
units in Poland, to move up to assist.]{.underline} In the maritime
domain, NATO's naval strength clearly outmatches Russia's, but
operations in confined waters like the Baltic or Black Seas [are
complicated by land-based air and missile
threats](https://www.fpri.org/article/2020/07/maritime-security-issues-in-the-baltic-sea-region/),
as well as sea mines. Russian anti-ship missiles also outrange NATO's.
Should Russian naval forces begin to attack commercial shipping in
international waters, NATO can respond with standoff weapons, but should
exercise caution within range of land-based systems until they are
suppressed. If Turkey agrees, stronger NATO naval forces should enter
the Black Sea to provide flexible response options to counter Russian
maritime aggression. [**Take an unambiguous stance on nuclear policy.**
To relieve the threat of a Russian first-use nuclear strike and regain
freedom of action, the United States and NATO must return to core
deterrence principles.]{.underline} [As it has for many decades, nuclear
deterrence rests on both capability and credibility. NATO nuclear
forces, though much reduced since the Cold War]{.underline} (especially
with respect to theater nuclear systems) [are redundant, survivable, and
absolutely capable of destroying Russia from end to end.]{.underline}
[NATO's credibility, on the other hand, is [constantly
undermined](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-putin-exploits-americas-fear-of-nuclear-war-nato-ukraine-invasion-attack-russia-11647982092)
when leaders publicly express palpable fears that Putin will employ his
nuclear arsenal, for unclear reasons and in unclear ways, and that they
must at all costs avoid pushing him into a corner. A resolve not to be
bullied is essential]{.underline}. Deterrence works best when leaders
are direct, unambiguous, resolute, and calm, as John Kennedy was during
the Cuban Missile Crisis. As President Emmanuel [Macron reminded his
public](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1571786/ukraine-news-Vladimir-Putin-nato-france-nuclear-weapons-russia-invasion)
recently, the West has nuclear weapons, too. **[Use economic tools as a
primary "offensive" weapon.]{.underline}** [As the military campaign
progresses, sanctions will continue to strangle the Russian economy.
This pressure must continue---and, if possible, intensify---in order to
force Russia, not just to the negotiating table, but to withdraw
altogether from Ukrainian territory. To date, not all Russian banks have
been banned from SWIFT, and many oligarchs remain
unsanctioned]{.underline}. [Though painful and difficult, weaning Europe
from Russian energy, divesting from Russian businesses, and closing
European markets are powerful weapons the EU can wield in its own right.
(While 37 percent of Russian trade is with Europe, only [4 percent of
the EU's goods exports go to
Russia](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Russia-EU_%E2%80%93_international_trade_in_goods_statistics).)]{.underline}
[Today, Russian energy remains exempt from EU sanctions.]{.underline}
Developing alternate sources of energy, in particular, will take time
and investment, but [continued reliance on Russian oil and natural gas
can only enable Putin to continue to finance the war in
Ukraine.]{.underline} In March 2022, the EU imposed its [fourth tranche
of trade
sanctions](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/restrictive-measures-ukraine-crisis/)
on Russia, tightening export restrictions on dual-use technologies,
expanding the list of sanctioned persons related to defense industries;
imposing further trade restrictions for steel, iron, and luxury goods;
and prohibiting transactions with specific state-owned enterprises. The
challenge now will be to maintain the full range of sanctions until they
bear fruit. Global food shortages, rising energy prices, and scarcities
among certain commodities will challenge the sanctions regime. [Much
depends on the persistence and resolve of Western leaders. Properly
understood, comprehensive economic sanctions against Russia---what the
French finance minister has called "total economic and financial war on
Russia"---can be a major tool, denying Putin the financial resources to
carry on the war and generating internal pressures on elites that could
lead to his removal.]{.underline} By themselves, however, they [will
probably not end the
war](https://jacobinmag.com/2022/03/putin-ukraine-russia-sanctions-us-eu-economy).
China, Brazil, and India remain open markets and suppliers, if not
active supporters, while Hungary and Serbia retain close ties. As former
Deputy National Security Adviser General Rick Waddell has pointed out to
the author, "An economy that is self-sufficient in energy and food takes
a lot of killing." In concert with diplomacy, aggressive information
operations, and the military instrument of power, sanctions can be a
vital component of an overall strategy to control and limit escalation
and drive conflict termination by draining Russia of the financial
resources it needs to carry on the war.

The People's Republic of China, the French Republic, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
and the United States of America consider the avoidance of war between
Nuclear-Weapon States and the reduction of strategic risks as our
foremost responsibilities. We affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won
and must never be fought. As nuclear use would have far-reaching
consequences, we also affirm that nuclear weapons---for as long as they
continue to exist---should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression,
and prevent war. We believe strongly that the further spread of such
weapons must be prevented. We reaffirm the importance of addressing
nuclear threats and emphasize the importance of preserving and complying
with our bilateral and multilateral non-proliferation, disarmament, and
arms control agreements and commitments. We remain committed to our
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) obligations, including our
Article VI obligation "to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective
measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date
and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete
disarmament under strict and effective international control." We each
intend to maintain and further strengthen our national measures to
prevent unauthorized or unintended use of nuclear weapons. We reiterate
the validity of our previous statements on de-targeting, reaffirming
that none of our nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or at any
other State. We underline our desire to work with all states to create a
security environment more conducive to progress on disarmament with the
ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished
security for all. We intend to continue seeking bilateral and
multilateral diplomatic approaches to avoid military confrontations,
strengthen stability and predictability, increase mutual understanding
and confidence, and prevent an arms race that would benefit none and
endanger all. We are resolved to pursue constructive dialogue with
mutual respect and acknowledgment of each other's security interests and
concerns.

Moreover, [industrialized]{.mark} [ag]{.mark}riculture like CAFOs,

[is]{.mark} actually [a]{.mark} [significant]{.mark} [cause of]{.mark}
the [decline in]{.mark} the rural [standard of living and quality of

protein are more widely understood, consumers will be less and less
willing to see their tax dollars used to prop up activities that damage
their rivers and lakes, poison their drinking water and air, and sicken
their children. The impact of these consumer shifts should not be
underestimated; changes to agricultural practices are already happening,
from humane standards for egg production to increased demand for organic
food and plant-based proteins. Additional changes are imminent. For
instance, although milk production has been increasing, U.S. dairy
consumption is down---one of the factors in the record-setting 1.4
billion-pound U.S. cheese surplus.100 Samantha Raphelson, Nobody Is
Moving Our Cheese: American Surplus Reaches Record High, NAT'L PUB.
RADIO (Jan. 9, 2019, 5:58 AM), https://perma.cc/JQU7-ZXGC. States are
also recognizing that **[[the damages]{.mark} caused by CAFOs [outweigh
the benefits]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Oregon considered two bills to
increase permitting requirements and environmental enforcement of air
and water emissions from dairies with at least 2,500 cows.101 Tracy
Loew, Oregon Bills Seek Nation's Toughest Dairy Recommendations,
STATESMAN J. (Dec. 12, 2018, 4:55 PM), https://perma.cc/C92D-XYLZ. The
bills gained traction after a dairy farm with 30,000 cows was found to
have more than 200 violations of its wastewater permit, including
overflowing manure lagoons, improper application of manure to fields,
and failure to report spills and leaks.102 Tracy Loew, Oregon Megadairy
Lost Valley Farm Fined \$187,320 for 224 Environmental Violations,
STATESMAN J. (Oct. 16, 2018, 3:34 PM), https://perma.cc/J69X-TQ6Z. Of
particular interest is that both bills "declare large dairies to be
industrial, rather than agricultural or farming operations," which would
eliminate their ability to qualify for certain state agricultural
exemptions and would subject them to local siting and health and safety
requirements.103 One of the bills would also require new dairy CAFOs to
post bonds "as security against environmental, health or animal welfare
costs, such as costs due to manure spills, improper disposal of animals,
excessive manure applications, cleaning up 100. 101. 102. 103. Loew,

703 abandoned facilities, or relocating animals after a facility
closure."104 In another notable development, Wisconsin appears to be
taking a bipartisan interest in increasing CAFO permitting fees to
account for their role in the widespread contamination of drinking water
in the State.105 Steven Verburg, Tony Evers, Republicans Both Looking to
Get Factory Farms to Pay for Cleaner Water, WIS. STATE J. (Mar. 17,
2019), https://perma.cc/WL95-GMDG. Although these state-level efforts
are notable, they do not provide a comprehensive solution to what is a
national problem. As stated by the Executive Director of the Pew
Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, "The present system of
producing food animals in the United States is not sustainable and
presents an unacceptable level of risk to public health and damage to
the environment, as well as unnecessary harm to the animals we raise for
food."106 The FARM SAFE Act proposed in this Article would tackle the
negative consequences of industrialized agriculture while providing
federal support where it is needed most---to promote proven sustainable
agricultural practices that protect the environment and public health
and help to ensure long-term food security and safety. The FARM SAFE Act
is about much more than eliminating bad practices of large agribusiness;
it would commit the resources of the federal government--- taxpayer
funds and agency efforts---to assisting agricultural operations that
grow food sustainably. Moreover, the FARM SAFE Act would provide support
exclusively to small and midsized agricultural producers whose success
or failure dramatically impacts their rural communities. Over time, the
changes would restore contaminated watersheds, create new jobs, and
revitalize rural America. [**[Sustainable]{.mark} [ag]{.mark}riculture

The British chancellor will tell a panel of experts at an IMF meeting in

## Collision Warning System

### Solvency -- Satellite Collisions

#### The USFG should... - work with the NOAA to develop OADR collision warning systems - subsidize the development and implementation of OADR

[**[A new]{.mark} [c]{.mark}ollision-[w]{.mark}arning [s]{.mark}ystem
[could help sat]{.mark}ellite [op]{.mark}erator[s]{.mark} [sleep]{.mark}
a little [easier.]{.mark}** [The]{.mark} prototype
[system]{.mark},]{.underline} [[developed]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ([NOAA]{.mark}), [is
designed to alert op]{.mark}erator[s]{.mark} [when their]{.mark}
space[craft]{.mark} [may be on a collision course]{.mark} with another
object.]{.underline} That\'s a real and growing concern, given how
[crowded Earth orbit is
becoming](https://www.space.com/space-junk-threat-satellites-guidelines-reduce-orbital-debris.html).
[The system,]{.underline} which was demonstrated in a [webcast press
conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAJE7VpOelo) on Feb. 11, [is
called the Open-Architecture Data Repository ([OADR]{.mark}).
[I]{.mark}t\'[s]{.mark} [a cloud database that keeps tabs]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} [the]{.mark} growing [population in
[Earth](https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html)
orbit and warns]{.mark} if there\'s a danger [of a collision]{.mark},
[just as you might get a weather warning]{.mark} if you\'re in the path
of a storm]{.underline}. It works like this: [The [OADR collects data on
space conditions from]{.mark} a number of different [scans from ground
sensors that together cover much of the globe]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[The OADR is linked]{.mark} both [to US]{.mark}-government-[affiliated
ground stations and to a]{.mark} network of [commercial
stations]{.mark}]{.underline} (especially in the Southern Hemisphere).
[The data also includes [space
weather](https://www.space.com/space-weather) observations and other
satellites\' live telemetry and maneuvering plans. [The OADR]{.mark}
takes in all that data and [creates a picture]{.mark} [of the orbital
environment]{.mark}, which [it]{.mark} then uses to [assess]{.mark} [if
there are any looming \"conjunctions]{.mark}\" --- close encounters
between orbiting objects. If there are any, the [OADR]{.mark} [can relay
that]{.mark} data back [to sat]{.mark}ellite [op]{.mark}erator[s]{.mark}
as a sort of weather forecast, [giving]{.mark}
[them]{.mark}]{.underline} (ideally) **[[several days to move]{.mark}
their satellite out of the way.]{.underline}** \"A hurricane
notification displays a probability cone that continually changes as new
data is obtained,\" Scott Leonard, Special Advisor to the Director of
NOAA\'s Office of Space Commerce, said in the Feb. 11 press conference.
\"A conjunction is similar.\" OADR is still under development; the newly
unveiled system is a prototype. According to Leonard, the OADR team
still needs to iron out some kinks with automating data collection and
prediction processes. If all goes according to plan, the OADR will see
initial public operation by 2024 and be fully operational by 2025. There
are already a number of commercial firms providing these sorts of
space-tracking services, but the OADR\'s creators hope that it will
ultimately have more data than those services --- and better predictive
capabilities to boot. It\'s hardly a secret that Earth orbit is getting
quite crowded. There are already [at least 23,000
objects](https://www.space.com/space-junk-growing-problem-complicated-solution)
in space with a diameter of 4 inches (10 centimeters) or greater. That
number really began to explode in the 21st century, and it isn\'t
slowing down. "We expect on the order of 57,000 new satellites by the
year 2030,\" Stephen Volz, assistant secretary of commerce for
environmental observation at NOAA, said in the press conference. And
in-space collisions aren\'t just the stuff of nightmare fantasy. Last
year, for example, a [Chinese military satellite
collided](https://www.space.com/space-junk-collision-chinese-satellite-yunhai-1-02)
with a piece of a 25-year-old Russian rocket. The satellites of
SpaceX\'s Starlink broadband constellation, which may someday consist of
more than 40,000 spacecraft, seem to be [a particular cause for
alerts](https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellite-collision-alerts-on-the-rise).
In its stewards\' eyes, [the [OADR]{.mark} [is intended to preemptively
keep track of]{.mark} all the [biggest threats]{.mark}. But [it]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} likely [be some time before any system can keep track of
the ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[[millions of tiny
objects]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/Space_debris_by_the_numbers)
[in orbit --- [everything from rubbish to shards of metal to flecks of
paint]{.mark} --- all of which can cause catastrophic damage, given how
fast everything moves up there.]{.underline}

In short -- yes. [**[Government subsidies assist]{.mark} the tech
[industry]{.mark}** [by covering]{.mark} the costs of [production
research and]{.mark} the [distribution]{.mark}]{.underline} of goods or
services. They can do this by offering tax credits, grants, loans, or
reimbursements as is seen in the CARES Act. [These [subsidies make it
possible]{.mark}]{.underline} for the tech industry [[to
increase]{.mark} the overall [supply]{.mark} of goods or services that
they offer. [This]{.mark} in turn [increases]{.mark} the [demand]{.mark}
for the good or service, [which lowers]{.mark} the overall
[price]{.mark} of the service.]{.underline} The idea is that [when
governments give subsidies]{.underline} to the tech industry[, [it's a
win]{.mark}-win both [for the supplier and the
customer]{.mark}]{.underline}. Subsidies give the tech industry more
money to dedicate to research and development[. [Customers]{.mark} can
[enjoy life-improving products at a cheaper price]{.mark}
[since]{.mark}]{.underline} tech [[dev]{.mark}eloper[s don't need to

[**[Photosynthetic carbon capture by trees is]{.mark}** likely to be
among **[our most effective strategie]{.mark}s [to]{.mark}
[limit]{.mark} the rise of [CO2]{.mark}** concentrations across the
globe
([1](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R1)--]{.underline}[3](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R3)).
Consequently, a number of international initiatives \[such as the Bonn
Challenge, the related AFR100, and the New York Declaration on Forests
([4](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R4),
[5](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R5))\]
have established ambitious targets to promote forest conservation,
afforestation, and restoration at a global scale. [[The latest]{.mark}
special [report]{.mark}
([1](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R1))
[by]{.mark} the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
([IPCC]{.mark}) [suggests]{.mark} that an increase of [1 billion ha of
forest will be necessary]{.mark} to limit global warming to 1.5°C [by
2050.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, it remains unclear whether these
restoration goals are achievable because we do not know how much tree
cover might be possible under current or future climate conditions or
where these trees could exist. Previous efforts to estimate global tree
cover potential have scaled existing vegetation estimates to the biome
or ecoregion levels to provide coarse approximations of global forest
degradation
([6](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R6),
[7](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R7)).
However, quantitatively evaluating which environments could support
trees requires that we build models using direct measurements of tree
cover (independent of satellite-derived models) from protected areas,
where vegetation cover has been relatively unaffected by human activity.
With enough observations that span the entire range of environmental
conditions, from the lowest to the highest possible tree cover, we can
interpolate these "natural tree cover" estimates across the globe to
generate a predictive understanding of the potential tree cover in the
absence of human activity. To explore the determinants of potential tree
cover, we used 78,774 direct photo-interpretation measurements (data
file S1)
([8](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R8))
of tree cover across all protected regions of the world (fig. S1)
([9](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R9),
[10](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R10)).
Using global environmental layers (table S1)
([11](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R11)),
we examined how climate, edaphic, and topographic variables drive the
variation in natural tree cover across the globe. The focus on protected
areas is intended to approximate natural tree cover. Of course, these
regions are not entirely free of human activity
([11](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R11)),
presenting slightly lower tree cover than expected in some regions or
higher tree cover than expected in other regions because of low fire
frequency, but these ecosystems represent areas with minimal human
influence on the overall tree cover. We then used a random forest
machine-learning approach
([12](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R12))
to examine the dominant environmental drivers of tree cover and
generated a predictive model ([Fig.
1](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#F1))
that enables us to interpolate potential tree cover across terrestrial
ecosystems. The resulting map---Earth's tree carrying capacity---defines
the tree cover per pixel that could potentially exist under any set of
environmental conditions, with minimal human activity ([Fig.
2A](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#F2)).
This work is directly underpinned by our systematic dataset of direct
tree cover measurements (entirely independent of climate and modeled
remote sensing estimates)
([13](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R13))
across the globe (fig. S1)
([10](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R10)).
[Across the world's protected areas]{.underline} (fig. S2), [tree cover
ranged between peaks of 0% in dry desert and 100% in dense equatorial
forest]{.underline}, [with fewer values falling between these two
extremes]{.underline} (figs. S2 and S3). We paired these tree cover
measurements with 10 global layers of soil and climate data (table S1)
([11](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R11)).
[[Our]{.mark} resulting random forest [model had high predictive
power]{.mark}]{.underline} \[coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.86;
intercept = --2.05% tree cover; slope = 1.06\] ([Fig.
1](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#F1));
rigorous k-fold cross-validation (fig. S4A)
([11](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R11))
revealed that our model could explain \~71% of the variation in tree
cover without bias (R2 = 0.71; intercept = 0.34% tree cover; slope =
0.99) (fig. S3, B and C). Our k-fold cross-validation approach also
allows us to generate a spatially explicit understanding of model
uncertainty (figs. S5 and S6)
([11](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R11)).
Across all pixels, the mean standard deviation around the modeled
estimate is \~9% in tree cover (28% of the mean tree cover) (figs. S5
and S6)
([11](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R11)).
As such, [[these]{.mark} models [accurately reflected the distribution
of tree]{.mark} [cover]{.mark} [across]{.mark} the full range of
[protected areas]{.mark}. We then interpolated this random forest model
across all terrestrial ecosystems using all 10 soil and climate
variables to project potential tree cover across the globe under
existing environmental conditions. [The]{.mark} resulting [map]{.mark}
[reveals Earth's]{.mark} tree carrying [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline} at
a spatial resolution of 30 arc sec ([Fig.
2A](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#F2)).
[[The model]{.mark} accurately [predicts the presence of forest]{.mark}
in all existing forested land on the planet]{.underline} (fig. S7A[)
[but also reveals the extent of tree cover that could naturally
exist]{.mark} in regions beyond existing forested lands.]{.underline}
The most recent Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO) definition of "forest" corresponds to a land of at least 0.5 ha
covered by at least 10% tree cover and without agricultural activity or
human settlements
([14](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R14)).
Using this definition, our map reveals that [about two-thirds of
terrestrial land, 8.7 billion ha, could support forest]{.underline}
(table S2). [That value is 3.2 billion ha more than the current forested
area]{.underline} (fig. S7A)
([11](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R11),
[15](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R15)).
We estimate that 1.4 billion ha of this potential forest land is located
in croplands (\>99%) and urban areas (\<1%), as delineated by the
European Space Agency's global land cover model (fig. S7B and table S2)
([16](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R16)),
and 1.5 billion ha with croplands as delineated by Fritz et al. (fig.
S7C and table S2)
([17](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R17)).
[Therefore, \~1.7 billion to [1.8 billion ha]{.mark} [of
potential]{.mark} forest land]{.underline} (defined as \>10% tree cover)
[[exists in areas that were previously degraded]{.mark}, dominated by
sparse vegetation, grasslands, and degraded bare soils.]{.underline} To
avoid the pitfalls of categorical forest definitions, we also evaluated
the tree canopy cover in a truly continuous scale (fig. S8). We refer to
"canopy cover" as the area of the land that is covered by tree crown
vertically projected to the ground (for example, 50% of tree cover over
1 ha corresponds to 0.5 ha of canopy cover) (fig. S8). By accounting for
all levels of tree cover (from 0 to 100%), this approach balances the
relative contribution of different forest types (such as woodlands, open
forest, and dense forest) and of wooded lands outside forests (such as
savannas) across the globe. In total, [[4.4 billion]{.mark} ha of canopy
cover [can be supported]{.mark} on land [under existing climate
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} (pixel uncertainty = 28%; global
uncertainty \<1%) (table S2)
([11](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R11)).
[This value is [1.6 billion]{.mark} ha [more]{.mark} [than]{.mark} the
2.8 billion ha existing on land [today]{.mark}]{.underline}
([10](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R10),
[15](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R15)).
Of course, much of the land that could potentially support trees across
the globe is currently used for human development and agriculture, which
are necessary for supporting an ever-growing human population. On the
basis of both the European Space Agency's global land cover model
([16](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R16))
and on Fritz and colleagues cropland layer
([17](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R17)),
[we estimate that [0.9 billion]{.mark} hectares [are]{.mark} found
[outside]{.mark} [cropland and urban regions]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Fig.
2, B and
C](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#F2),
and table S2)
([11](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R11))
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[represent regions for]{.mark} potential
[restoration]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[More than 50%]{.mark} of the tree
restoration potential [can be found in]{.mark} only [six
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} (in million hectares[: [Russia]{.mark},
+151; [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, +103; [Canada]{.mark}, +78.4;
[Australia]{.mark}, +58; [Brazil]{.mark}, +49.7; [and China]{.mark},
+40.2]{.underline}) (data file S2), [stressing the important
responsibility of some of the world's leading economies.]{.underline} By
comparing our country-level results to the commitments of 48 countries
in the Bonn Challenge
([4](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R4)),
we can provide a scientific evaluation of the country-level restoration
targets. Approximately 10% of countries have committed to restoring an
area of land that considerably exceeds the total area that is available
for restoration (data file S2). By contrast, [over [43% of]{.mark} the
[countries]{.mark} have [committed]{.mark} [to]{.mark} restore an area
that is [less than 50% of the area available]{.mark} for
restoration]{.underline}. [These results [reinforce the need for better
country-level forest accounting]{.mark}, which is critical for
developing effective management and restoration strategies]{.underline}.
Of course, it remains unclear what proportion of this land is public or
privately owned, and so we cannot identify how much land is truly
available for restoration. However, at a global scale, [our model

[achievable under the current climate]{.mark}]{.underline}. By scaling
these forest area calculations by biome-level mean estimates of carbon
storage
([18](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R18),
[19](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R19)),
we estimate that [vegetation in [the]{.mark} potential
[restoration]{.mark} areas could **[store an additional 205 gigatonnes
of carbon]{.mark}**]{.underline} (GtC) if they were restored to the
status of existing forests (table S2). Our model accurately depicts the
regions where tree growth is possible under existing environmental
conditions. However, changing climate conditions may alter the area of
land that could support forest growth over the rest of the century, a
point that needs to be considered when developing long-term restoration
projects. We tested this possibility by rerunning our potential tree
cover model under future climate conditions, projected under three Earth
System Models
([10](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R10))
and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (RCP 4.5
and 8.5)
([1](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R1)).
Under both scenarios, the global tree carrying capacity is lower than
the present day potential because of reductions in the potential area of
tropics. This is in stark contrast to most current model predictions,
which expect global tree cover to increase under climate change
([20](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R20)).
Although warming is likely to increase tree cover in cold regions with
low tree cover (for example, in northern boreal regions such as Siberia)
or with existing open forests (such as in tropical drylands) ([Fig.
3](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#F3)),
our model highlights the high probability of consistent declines of
tropical rainforests with high tree cover. Because the average tree
cover in the expanding boreal region (30 to 40%) is lower than that in
declining tropical regions (90 to 100%), our global evaluation suggests
that the potential global canopy cover will decrease under future
climate scenarios, even if there is a larger total forest area with
\>10% tree cover. Therefore, despite potential increases in canopy cover
in boreal (\~130 Mha), desertic (\~30 Mha), montane (\~30 Mha), and
temperate (\~30 Mha) regions, the potential loss of forest habitat in
tropical regions (\~450 Mha) leads to a global loss of 223 Mha of
potential canopy cover by 2050, corresponding to 46 GtC ([Fig.
3B](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#F3)
and table S3). Such risks of loss do not account for future changes in
land use, such as pasture and cattle raising
([7](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R7)),
which might also contribute to the urgency of the situation. These
models of future changes in tree cover potential reveal insights into
how the structure of vegetation might change over time. Of course, these
models are characterized by high uncertainty because, unlike the
present-day interpolations, we rely on extrapolation of our
machine-learning models outside of the existing range of global climate
conditions. These extrapolations cannot be considered to be future
projections of potential forest extent because they do not incorporate
any of the ecological, hydrological, and biogeochemical feedbacks that
would be associated with changes in forest cover. For example, it is
possible that elevated CO2 concentrations under future climate scenarios
might enhance the growth of those existing trees, although recent
evidence suggests that increased growth rate does not necessarily
translate to increase of carbon storage
([21](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R21)).
However, our approach has a strong predictive power to describe the
potential tree cover in the absence of humans under any given set of
future climate scenarios. The global photointerpretation dataset offers
the capacity to characterize the potential tree cover under any given
set of environmental conditions. The resulting openly accessible map can
serve as a benchmark map to assess restoration opportunities (such as
tree planting and natural assisted regeneration) around the globe, with
a tree cover of reference that respects the natural ecosystem type (for
example, from wooded savannah to dense forest). However, [restoration
[initiatives]{.mark} [must not lead to the loss of existing]{.mark}
natural [ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as native grasslands,
[that can support huge amounts of natural biodiversity and
carbon.]{.underline} Using existing global land-cover layers
([15](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R15)--[17](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R17)),
our maps reveal that [[there]{.mark} is likely to be [space]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} at least an additional **[0.9 billion ha of canopy
cover]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If restored woodlands and forests were
allowed to mature to a similar state of existing ecosystems in protected
areas, [[they could store up to 205 GtC]{.underline}]{.mark}. Given that
the airborne fraction of carbon dioxide is \~45%
([1](https://www-science-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848#R1)),
[[reaching this]{.mark} maximum restoration potential [would reduce a

When someone is throwing nukes at you, you can probably tell where
they\'re coming from. There\'s only a few nuclear nations and, over the
decades of the Cold War, they have developed complex strategic
intelligence and early warning networks. But [what about a cyber
war?]{.underline} Particularly [the kind of]{.underline} intense
multi-vector [cyber attack targeting critical
infrastructur]{.underline}e that\'s been dubbed as [cyber
blitzkrieg](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyber-blitzkrieg-replaces-cyber-pearl-harbor/)?
**[Cyber attribution is hard. It\'s not impossible, but it takes

**[The [Moscow--Washington

of Cold War fame **[is the archetype]{.underline}**. During the
high-stakes nuclear [Cuban Missile
Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis) of 1962,
official diplomatic messages took up to six hours to deliver. Presidents
John F Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev had to resort to unofficial
channels, including relaying messages via TV news correspondents. The
Moscow--Washington hotline was installed the following year. This
hotline was never the iconic red telephone of TV and movies. At first it
was a teletype, then a fax machine, and now email. Initially, its
terrestrial phone lines were backed up by a radio link via Tangier in
northwestern Morocco. Today, a set of satellite links are backed up by
optical fibre. At least eight other pairs of nations have [developed
their own hotlines](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Hotlines).
**[Cyber]{.underline}** [versions of these]{.underline}

\[PDF\]. \"The **[strategic level of signaling]{.underline}** **[should

**[signaling]{.underline}** through traditional mechanisms that have

preceding or running concurrently with defend forward cyber

\"when and under what conditions the US government will voluntarily
self-attribute cyber operations and campaigns for the purposes of
signaling capability and intent to various audiences\". **[Diplomatic
tools like hotlines]{.underline}** **[are]{.underline}** examples of
what diplomats call \"**[confidence building measures]{.underline}**\".
Confidence building **[is one of]{.underline}** four **[pillars of cyber
diplomacy]{.underline}** Your writer has previously reported on
Australia\'s part in developing the so-called [11 international
norms](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyberwar-looms-as-diplomats-dither/)
for nation-state behaviour in cyberspace and last year\'s [restart of
the UN\'s stalled
process](https://www.zdnet.com/article/australia-to-keep-playing-the-un-cyberspace-norms-game/)
for negotiating such rules. Last month, the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade (DFAT) reported that it was [progressing work on the
norms](https://www.zdnet.com/article/australia-progressing-work-on-agreed-norms-of-responsible-state-behaviour-in-cyberspace/).
Norms of behaviour are only a quarter of the cyber diplomacy story,
however. \"You have binding international law, you have voluntary
non-binding norms, which complement and together set clear expectations
of behaviour,\" said Johanna Weaver, Australia\'s cyber negotiator at
the UN. \"You have **[capacity building]{.underline}**, which **[is a
really important part of it]{.underline}** \... **[to make
sure]{.underline}** that all **[countries have the ability to implement
the recommendations and agreements]{.underline}**,\" she told ZDNet.
\"Then you\'ve got **[confidence building measures]{.underline}**, which
are **[designed to increase trust and transparency]{.underline}**.\"
While the building of **[hotlines]{.underline}** **[has not yet become a
priority at the UN,]{.underline}** there has been modest progress at the
regional level in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Australia and Malaysia\'s proposal for a [regional cyber points of

Intersessional Meeting on Security of and in the use of ICTs in
Singapore back in March 2019. \"The directory will provide a means of
direct communication to prevent miscalculation and escalation, as well
as manage potential responses in the event of cybersecurity incidents
with the potential to impact regional security,\" DFAT wrote. A cyber
equivalent to the International Atomic Energy Agency? The UN\'s
Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), one of the two UN bodies negotiating
the rules for cyberspace, has stressed the importance of accurate
attribution of cyber attacks. \"It was suggested that **[developing a
common approach to attribution]{.underline}** at the technical level
**[could lead to greater accountability, transparency, and
c]{.underline}**ould help support **[legal recourse for those harmed by
malicious acts]{.underline}**,\" OEWG wrote in the [initial
pre-draft](https://unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/200311-Pre-Draft-OEWG-ICT.pdf)
\[PDF\] of its report. Australia has noted that attribution comes in two
flavours. One is factual attribution, \"the factual circumstances,
including the technical indicators that allow you to make an assessment
as to a technical assessment of attribution,\" Weaver said during a
briefing in April. \"Then there is a legal attribution assessment, which
is taking into account the considerations of state responsibility. Can
you take those technical or factual circumstances and say this is
therefore attributable to a particular government?\" Separate from that
is any political decision to act publicly or privately on both of those
attribution assessments, she said. To this end, the Geneva-based
ICT4Peace Foundation has proposed what they\'ve dubbed to be a Global
Cyber Attribution Network. \"ICT4Peace proposes the setting up of an
independent network of organisations engaging in attribution
peer-review,\" the organisation wrote in its policy brief [Trust and
Attribution in
Cyberspace](https://ict4peace.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ICT4Peace-2019-Trust-and-Attribution-in-Cyberspace.pdf)
\[PDF\]. Currently, most attribution is done by private cyber threat
intelligence organisations and national security agencies. \"**[For
international legal provisions]{.underline}** **[to be
effective]{.underline}**, and **[accountability]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** malicious **[cyber activities]{.underline}** to
**[take hold, high levels of confidence and]{.underline}** publicly
**[persuasive attribution of responsibility are
required]{.underline}**,\" ICT4Peace wrote. This new independent
attribution agency should include \"government representatives, private
sector pundits as well as proponents from civil society and academia\".
Microsoft has also suggested, in 2017, an [attribution organisation to
strengthen trust
online](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/an-attribution-organization-to-strengthen-trust-online)
as part of its Digital Geneva Convention proposal. Such an agency has
been compared with the long-established International Atomic Energy
Agency, but the cyber world is vastly different. \"Nuclear technology is
industrial by design. It is difficult, if not impossible, to develop
nuclear capabilities in hiding. Also, military use of nuclear technology
is very different from civilian use,\" ICT4Peace wrote. \"Cyber
capabilities on the other hand are software based. In contrast to
nuclear technology, cyber tools do not emit suspicious radiation and do
not require factories for their development. A handful of dedicated
individuals gathered in a room can launch a cyberattack of sizeable
magnitude.\" While an independent agency wouldn\'t be able to provide
real-time attribution during a cyber attack, its existence and its
ability to subsequently validate or refute a nation\'s claims could
provide a break on cyber escalation. ZDNet understands that the idea of
an IAEA-style cyber inspection agency is raised at the UN from time to
time, including in the OEWG intersessional multi-stakeholder
consultations, but for various reasons, it has yet to gain traction.

Russky Newsweek, the Russian-language edition of Newsweek, ran a cover
story in its November 23, 2009, is- sue on cyber crime that pointed a
very big finger at Russian hackers working from home and abroad. It used
terms like the "Evil Cyber Empire" and the "Cold Cyber War." At the same
time, NATO is trying to understand how it should deal with cybersecurity
issues. Does a cyber attack on a NATO member state trigger the Article V
commitment of the mutual defense treaty? Geopolitics during the Cold War
was about borders and defending them. **[Cyber diplomacy in the
twenty-first century]{.underline}** **[is about managing]{.underline}**
a world **[that is not just borderless]{.underline}** **[but can
function best when connectivity]{.underline}** **[is almost
seamless]{.underline}**. **[This world]{.underline}**---so dependent on
stable financial transactions and global trading---**[cannot function at
all if cyber connectivity is successfully attacked]{.underline}**. **[So
how does NATO]{.underline}**, **[a geographically defined
alliance]{.underline}** **[trying to redefine its relationship with
Russia]{.underline}**, **[understand its role in pro- moting cyber
diplomacy and cyber peace]{.underline}**? What should the institutional
structure and strategic profile of NATO look like if the biggest
security threats to it in the next ten years are from terrorists or
states with advanced cyber offensive capabilities? One big change will
be in espionage. It will continue but its fundamental character will
change. Russia will change its intelligence-gathering priorities in NATO
countries, and the United States will change its espionage priorities in
Russia. All parties will become more interested in pro- tecting at least
some of the others' secrets than in stealing them, because to do so will
buttress their own economic security. For **[NATO]{.underline}**, **[the
time has definitely arrived for it to el- evate
cybersecurity]{.underline}** to the top rank of issues **[to be dealt
with in its official relations with Russia]{.underline}**; **[the two
sides have a shared interest in seeking common solutions, not simply
looking at each other as potential threats.]{.underline}** A low-profile
speech by the vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General
James E. Cartwright, in June 2009 gave a glimpse of an emerging
strategic concept in the world's only military superpower---something he
dubbed "global strike."91 He said that the low-end capa- bility for
global strike "is probably \[the ability to be\] any place on the face
of the earth in an hour," while the "high end is any place on the face
of the earth in about 300 mil- liseconds---that's cyber." This view was
expressed during a discussion of the forthcoming quadrennial review of
the country's military planning and capability. It flowed from
Cartwright's vision of what deterrence looks like in the twenty-first
century. Citing the proliferation of ballistic missiles, Cartwright
observed that a new attack---potentially nuclear---"could be over in
minutes." This circumstance would require, he said, "something that
deters that conflict and it has to be more than nuclear." For him, part
of the argument is that his country's military bases are located "where
we fought the Indians, the Japanese and the Germans." He suggested that
current basing realities might not address the needs of deterring or
responding to new threats.

judicial agreements,\" Alliance gridlock has prevented NATO from even
initiating a relationship with Russia on issues of mutual concern.148 As
a consequence, NATO members with favorable bilateral relations with the
Russian Federation are bypassing NATO to work directly with Russia on
cybersecurity and other topics, which neutralizes the collective
influence of NATO and plays toward the Russian strategic goal of
marginalizing NATO wherever possible.149 Rather than sitting on the
sidelines as the cyber domain is evolving around it, **[NATO has the
opportunity]{.underline}** and the need now **[to match its actions to
its rhetoric by accepting Russian]{.underline}** overtures **[to
cooperate on cybersecurity]{.underline}**. It should build internal
consensus on engaging Russia with relatively low-cost, low-risk measures
where both sides can easily find agreement as first steps toward an
eventually more substantial partnership that tackles the thornier
problems where the two sides have fundamental differences. Specifically,
**[NATO should seek to cooperate with Russia to
accomplish]{.underline}** the following **[goals]{.underline}**. Add a
Cybersecurity Working Group to the NATO-Russia Council. Ideally, this
arrangement would establish a stand-alone working group on par with
working groups covering topics like missile defense, logistics, or
terrorism. If that were to provide too broad of a mandate for the
Alliance partners to agree to, it could be formed as a subgroup
underneath the Science for Peace and Security Committee with a much
narrower and more technical purview. In any case, forming a working
group at the NRC would signal the intention to work seriously with
Russia on cybersecurity and would provide an organizational venue for
doing so.150 Partner Computer Emergency Response Teams. Regardless of
the level of trust between NATO and the Russian Federation, having
contacts established between the technical experts who have the ability
to respond in the event of a crisis is invaluable.151 NATO should
collectively adopt the pragmatic stance of some of its member states and
begin a series of limited, technically-oriented exchanges between the
NATO Computer Incident Response Capability Technical Center and the
Russian CERT in order to exchange technical information and determine
how best to communicate during a crisis. Share Cyber Intel. Because
cyberspace is constantly evolving and the nefarious actors who operate
within it are continually adapting, maintaining up-to-date information
on cyber threats is an endless challenge. Likewise, **[sharing
intelligence across NATO]{.underline}** **[can be]{.underline}** a
sensitive and **[difficult]{.underline}** process, so any proposal for
trading secrets with Russia might on the surface seem dubious - except
that [during an]{.underline} [April 2013 **visit to
Moscow,**]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}** Deputy
**[Secretary-General]{.underline}** Alexander Vershbow **[proposed the
creation of two centers to allow Russia and NATO to share
intelligence]{.underline}**, conduct joint planning, and coordinate
operations on missile defense.152 While a final agreement on
establishing these centers is nowhere near, missile defense has been as
much of a source of friction between the **[U.S., NATO, and
Russia]{.underline}** as **[cybersecurity]{.underline}**, so the
proposed **[facilities]{.underline}** **[provide a template for a cyber
threat information clearinghouse as another space for NATO and Russia to

work initially on shared analysis of excellent but unclassified data
from commercial cybersecurity firms and, as trust is built, graduate to
more sensitive and classified intelligence products.153 **[Develop
Confidence-Building Measures]{.underline}**. The Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is nearing completion of a set
of **[confidence-building measures]{.underline}** (CBMs) intended to
**[prevent misunderstandings]{.underline}** **[and avert international
conflicts among its]{.underline}** fifty-seven member
**[countries]{.underline}**.154 Although the publicly available draft of
the measures reveals them to be voluntary and not particularly
robust,155 the agreement, once finalized, will be important for having
started a conversation on cybersecurity among over a quarter of the
world\'s nation-states and in facilitating the exchange of cybersecurity
terminology, doctrine, and contacts among the members. **[NATO
should]{.underline}** build on the OSCE agenda to **[pursue a
more]{.underline}** detailed and more **[ambitious set of CBMs with
Russia]{.underline}**, including joint early-warning mechanisms,
exchanges of technical cybersecurity recommendations, **[and improvement
of cyber crisis communication]{.underline}**
**[channels]{.underline}**.156 Given that all twenty-eight NATO
countries and Russia are part of the OSCE, achieving consensus on
confidence-building measures at the NRC should be attainable, and it
would go a long way to addressing Russia\'s almost paralyzing fears of
being blamed for a cyber incident in which it legitimately played no
role.157 And since NATO and Russia have a long track record of devising
CBMs related to nuclear weapons, adapting those existing procedures and
processes to cybersecurity would appear eminently achievable.

**[Cyber]{.underline}** **[and space]{.underline}** **[is a promising
arena]{.underline}** **[for NATO]{.underline}** **[to address
China]{.underline}** challenges **[by building member state
resilience.]{.underline}** Like the air and sea domains, as areas that
belong to no one state and which provide access to much of the globe,
**[they form part of the global commons]{.underline}**. Command of the
commons has been the key enabler of the US global position of power for
many
decades.[26](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
However, **[China wields]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}**
**[sufficient]{.underline}** range of sea, air, **[cyber, and space
capabilities]{.underline}** such that the global commons is now a
contested zone. In contrast to the sea and air domains, cyber and space
are sparsely regulated. This **[lack of international norms enhances the
risk of conflict based on misperception]{.underline}**, **[making NATO
cooperation pertinent]{.underline}**. Adversarial activities toward the
US and Europe in the cyber and space domain threaten transatlantic
security. These come not just from China, but also from other
adversaries such as Russia and Iran. Mechanisms for addressing these
challenges in the military sector are essentially generic and not, at
least in their basic design, established with a particular country in
mind. Thus, cyber and space provide an avenue for NATO to contribute
significantly to deterrence of China without having to combat major
internal resistance. NATO would also benefit from long-standing US-EU
cooperation on cyber and space
issues.[27](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
**[Cyber and space provide an avenue for NATO to
contribute]{.underline}** **[without major internal
resistance]{.underline}** NATO has vowed to clarify Article Five's
collective defense commitment to encompass threats to satellites in
space and coordinated cyberattacks. NATO can design this effort to
include adversarial behavior from China. The alliance already has an
array of instruments to deal with cyber and space challenges from
adversaries. These can be extended to encompass China without
pronouncing it a
threat.[28](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
This approach allows the US and Europe time to adjust their cooperation
to take into account the fact that China poses military threats to them
both without explicitly using the language of threat at a time when NATO
members do not agree if China should be defined as a challenge that can
trigger Article Five responses. Since the late 1990s, the vulnerability
of shared space assets to cyberattacks has been a concern for both the
US and Europe. For example, in 1998 a US-German satellite, used for
peering into deep space, was rendered useless after it turned suddenly
toward the sun, damaging its High Resolution Imager by exposure. NASA
later determined that the accident was linked to a cyber-intrusion at
the Goddard Space Flight Center. Coordinated cyberattacks have emerged
as a major threat to both the US and Europe since the late 1990s. For
example, for about eighteen minutes on April 8, 2010, China Telecom
advertised erroneous network traffic routes that instructed US and other
foreign internet traffic to travel through Chinese servers. Other
servers around the world quickly adopted these paths, routing all
traffic, including government and military traffic, to about 15 percent
of the internet's destinations through servers located in
China.[29](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
In the future, the need to enhance situational awareness in space is
likely to lead to further integration of space assets between the US and
its allies. Civilian entry points are likely to provide a growing
opportunity for infiltration. The weak state of cybersecurity in
civilian agencies should also be considered. Chinese military doctrine
prioritizes weaponry that targets vulnerabilities in the deployment of
US and allied power, such as the use of cyberattacks to disrupt
surveillance assets, intelligence networks, and command-and-control
systems.[30](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
These threats are significant, since next generation systems, including
fighter aircraft, destroyers, and special forces, will not function
without access to space communication and space-derived data. Although
European and US allies have indigenous space programs outside the NATO
framework, cyber security and outer space would be a useful field for
joint explorations of how to divert and manage attacks and identify an
agency which can coordinate transatlantic responses to attacks. Allies
are embedded in a range of information networks which may be disrupted,
giving rise to alliance management concerns emerging from attacks. The
**[lack of red lines]{.underline}** **[regarding behavior]{.underline}**
**[in cyber and outer space]{.underline}** **[between the US and its
allies]{.underline}** on one hand, **[and adversaries]{.underline}**
such as China on the other, **[adds to the risk of misperception and
escalation]{.underline}**, and hence also **[highlights the need for
allied coordination]{.underline}** to avoid starting a war by mistake.
**[An improved NATO dialogue on safeguards and alliance consultation
could also assist communication with China on arms control and conflict
prevention in cyber and outer space,]{.underline}** which is not
currently taking place. Looking to the future, NATO's success in
establishing transatlantic mechanisms for cyber and outer space
safeguards and consultation will be crucial to allow NATO a key role in
taking on the China challenge in ways that help restore faith in NATO's
credibility as a provider of collective defense in all domains. It will
also assist NATO in straddling the chasm between member states
prioritizing threats from either China, Russia, the Middle East, or
North Africa, since cyber and space threats potentially stem from all of
them, and the effectiveness of cyber and space defense mechanisms do not
necessarily depend on geographical origin. Cyber and space would allow
NATO a key role in the China challenge without prioritizing China
**[Improved communication]{.underline}** between NATO and the EU **[will
be essential for NATO to successfully address the military aspects of
cyber and space threats.]{.underline}** The framework for permanent
EU-NATO relations, Berlin Plus, was concluded in March 2003. It allows
for the exchange of classified information, the EU's use of NATO assets
and capabilities for EU-led crisis management operations, and the
establishment of consultation
arrangements.[31](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
Due to disagreements over responsibilities and jurisdiction, however,
meaningful coordination did not take place until July 2016. On this
occasion, NATO and the EU issued a joint declaration stating their
intention to work together on security and defense responses to
unprecedented challenges emanating from the South and East of the
Euro-Atlantic
area.[32](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)During
Biden's visit to Brussels in June 2021, NATO promised to strengthen
cooperation with the EU on promoting peace and stability including
protecting critical infrastructure, strengthening resilience,
maintaining a technological edge, and addressing challenges to a
rules-based
order.[33](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
The EU-US summit statement from the same visit merely reaffirms support
for robust NATO-EU cooperation and promises to strengthen the
partnership.[34](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
At the level of policy implementation, it is clear when talking to NATO
and EU officials that usually they do not coordinate their strategies
and tactics for countering China
challenges.[35](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)

#### China wants cyber diplomacy to maintain interdependence with the West

//DamienHS WAgustin

In absolute terms, the People\'s Republic of China is the European
Union\'s largest trading partner. China is its most significant source
of imports and second-largest export market. The EU is second only to
the United States as China\'s top trade partner.207 In the framework of
the EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation signed in 2013 - the
strategy that guides comprehensive bilateral cooperation - the EU and
China agreed to establish strategic partnership across a wide range of
issues, including sustainable development, economic prosperity, global
governance, foreign policy, security and peace.208 In 2017, China and
Europol reached an agreement known as the \"Europol-China Strategic
Cooperation Framework\" to increase law enforcement cooperation directed
at combating transnational crime. The 2016 Joint Communication on
\"Elements for a new EU strategy on China\", adopted by the High
Representative, the European Commission209 and the EU Council\'s
Strategy on China210 further clarified EU priorities vis-à-vis China. In
line with the EU\'s overarching engagement strategy, it put special
attention on human rights, the rule of law, social-economic issues,
trade and investment and market access. **[The EU]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}** repeatedly **[highlighted the need to
curb]{.underline}** industrial **[cyber espionage by intensifying
cooperation with China]{.underline}** on reforming the country\'s
\"protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights\"211
through mechanisms such as the Intellectual Property Rights Infringement
Protection212 and the EU-China Strategic Framework for Customs
Cooperation on IPR for 2018-2020.213 Underscoring the importance of
intellectual property rights protection in Europe, and building on
synergies with Japan and the USTR Section 301 Report, the EU has also
launched a case at the WTO against China\'s \"unfair \[and forced\]
technology transfers\" and discriminatory treatment of foreign
companies.214 5.2 China\'s engagement with the EU and EU member states
**[The]{.underline}** landmark 2015 [Xi-Obama]{.underline} industrial
[cyber espionage agreement]{.underline} [has served as a template for EU
member states\']{.underline} **[cyber-related bilateral partnerships
with China]{.underline}**. Both [the United Kingdom]{.underline}
(2016)215 [and Germany]{.underline} (2015)216 **[have convinced China to
formally adopt a norm against cyber espionage in bilateral
accords]{.underline}**, **[commit to hold a regular
dialogue]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}** pertinent **[cyber
issues]{.underline}** **[and cooperate in]{.underline}** the fields of
**[incident mitigation]{.underline}**, CERTs assistance, cybercrime and
CBMs. European member states\' diplomatic approach to China has
therefore been more functional and in pursuit of concrete practical
outcomes of benefit for both sides. From EU countries\' vantage point,
this type of functional cooperation with China is necessary as it
transcends unsurmountable differences between the two sides\' normative
preferences, threat perceptions and security interests. For decades,
Sino-European Union relations have been characterised by consistently
growing economic and cultural ties. Accommodating China\'s economic rise
and appetite to shape international order has given rise to greater
technological interdependence in tandem with tremendous new normative,
security and political challenges. **[China\'s growing
assertiveness]{.underline}** - particularly its growing political reach
in Europe, which is often perceived as a lever to undermine the cohesion
of the Union - has eventually **[compelled the EU to fundamentally
redefine its China strategy]{.underline}** from an accommodation-based
engagement policy tow**[ards one of balancing]{.underline}** and
\"**[managed]{.underline}** **[interdependence]{.underline}**\" in key
strategic sectors and supply chains, with an emphasis on ensuring market
reciprocity.217 2019 saw the European Union chart a new bolder course
vis-à-vis China. In March 2019, weeks before the 21st EU-China Summit,
and coming after recommendations made by the Federation of German
Industries and other European actors (member states, other industry
federations, etc.) earlier that year,218 the European Commission
published an official document (\"EU-China - A strategic outlook\")
describing a new \"EU policy shift towards a more realistic, assertive,
and multi-faceted approach\" to dealing with China.219 The **[EU
asserts]{.underline}** that despite **[China being a cooperation and
negotiating \"partner\"]{.underline}** with which the EU needs to
(re)align objectives and strike a \"balance of interests\", the PRC has
increasingly become a \"systemic rival\" and an \"economic competitor\"
that leverages economic investment to achieve geopolitical gains,
energetically pursues global \"technological leadership\" and seeks to
export norms and forms of governance at odds with neoliberalism.
Furthermore, the profoundly intertwined role of the CCP in China\'s
economy and the opaque and highly blended divisions between the public
and private spheres and the military have made Chinese technology a
security risk for the EU in the \"short to mid-term\". Overall, the
EU\'s more critical stance before the 2019 summit has helped secure
several concessions from the Chinese side. **[Concerning EU-China
cooperation]{.underline}** **[in cyberspace]{.underline}**, the **[two
sides will continue working towards implementing norms of responsible
state behaviour]{.underline}** under the EU-China Cyber Task Force
framework and within parallel UN processes. While affirming that \"there
should be no forced technology transfers\", the two sides also committed
themselves to enhancing resilience against malicious cyber activities,
including against cyber-enabled intellectual property theft. The two
sides also committed to a concrete timeline to conclude the \"EU-China
Comprehensive Investment Agreement\", for which \"decisive progress\"
from the Chinese side - i.e. substantial market-opening reforms directed
at ensuring a level playing field - will be required in 2019.225
Furthermore, China and the EU are to cooperate on reforming the WTO,
though this will be conditional on China reforming the discriminatory
effects of industrial state subsidies and other related issues.

China and Russia have opened a direct presidential hot line to improve
understanding between the former communist rivals, the Foreign Ministry
announced Tuesday. The secure telecommunications link, China's first
with a foreign capital, will allow presidents Jiang Zemin and Boris
Yeltsin to \`\`exchange views on bilateral relations and international
issues at any time,″ Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.
**[U.S. Secretary of State]{.underline}** **[Madeleine

Minister Tang Jiaxuan signed an agreement]{.underline}** **[for
a]{.underline}** **[U.S.-China hot line]{.underline}** last week, but
Zhu said he did not know when it would open. China and the former Soviet
Union engaged in a tense rivalry for the allegiances of the socialist
world during the Cold War and fought border skirmishes in the late
1960s. Relations have improved steadily over the past decade.

#### Security Cooperation is administered by the DoD, Security Assistance is DoS

[U.S. Code Title 22 provides congressional authority to conduct DoS
Security Assistance programs]{.underline}. The programs are carried out
through two basic laws, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and the
Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA).24 AECA enacted congressional
legislative controls over export of defense articles and services. The
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs
Committee are responsible for foreign assistance and Security Assistance
program authorization legislation. The Senate and House Armed Services
Committees are responsible for defense programs authorization
legislation. [The term **security cooperation** is used within DoD,
whereas the term **security assistance** is used within the
DoS]{.underline}. It is important to note that these congressional
committees play a role only in FMS authorization. Although Congress
maintains legislative control over exports, FMS is a nonappropriated
program, external to the U.S. budget, and the president is charged with
signing off on spending for the program. Through Executive Order 11958,
as amended, the President delegates selected functions in the AECA to
the secretaries of State and Defense. They are required to provide
reports to Congress and obtain specific congressional approval on
certain exports or transfers. [The DoS has responsibilities relating to
**security assistance**, which include managing the export of defense
articles, services, training, and military technology]{.underline}.25
[DoD has responsibilities relating to **security cooperation**, which
include activities to encourage and enable international partners to
work with the United States to achieve strategic
objectives]{.underline}.26 The military departments and other DoD
agencies involved in managing FMS programs are collectively called
implementing agencies (IAs). The Army, Navy, and Air Force usually have
the responsibility of being the IA in the process of FMS.27 The Air
Force agency for all security cooperation programs is the Office of the
Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs
(SAF/IA). The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition has
oversight in the execution by virtue of having responsibility for Air
Force acquisition. SAF/IA is supported by the Air Force Security
Assistance Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for most FMS
and other logistics functions. The Air Force Security Assistance
Training (AFSAT) squadron at Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is in
charge of planning and, with AETC, managing the Air Force international
military training. It is organized under the authority of AETC.

[As Russia\'s military continues to pound Ukraine with missiles and
other lethal weapons]{.underline}, **[Western nations have
responded]{.underline}** in part **[by targeting
Russia\'s]{.underline}** **[defense]{.underline}** industry **[with
sanctions]{.underline}**. The latest round came on Tuesday, when the
United States issued new sanctions on some arms makers and executives at
the heart of what it dubbed Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s \"war
machine.\" But a Reuters examination of companies, [executives and
investors underpinning Russia\'s defense]{.underline} sector [shows a
sizable number of players have yet to pay a price]{.underline}: Nearly
**[three dozen leaders of Russian weapons firms and at least 14 defense
companies have not been sanctioned by the United States, the European
Union or the United Kingdom.]{.underline}** In addition, **[sanctions on
Russia\'s arms]{.underline}** makers and tycoons **[have been applied
inconsistently by these NATO allies]{.underline}**, with some
governments levying penalties and others not, the Reuters review showed.
[Among the weapons moguls who have not been sanctioned]{.underline} by
any of those three authorities [is]{.underline} [Alan
Lushnikov]{.underline}, the [largest shareholder of]{.underline}
**[Kalashnikov Concern JSC]{.underline}**, the original manufacturer of
the well-known AK-47 assault rifle. Lushnikov owns a 75% stake in the
firm, according to the most recent business records reviewed by Reuters.
The company itself was sanctioned by the United States in 2014, the year
Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. The EU and
UK leveled their own sanctions against Kalashnikov Concern this year.
**[The company accounts for 95% of Russia\'s production
of]{.underline}** machine **[guns]{.underline}**,
**[sniper]{.underline}** rifles, **[pistols]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** other **[handheld firearms]{.underline}**, **[and
98%]{.underline}** **[of its handheld military machine
guns]{.underline}**, according to its website and most recent annual
report. Its weapons include the AK-12 assault rifle, an updated version
of the AK-47, some of which have been captured from Russian forces by
Ukrainian soldiers. **[The Kalashnikov Concern also produces
missiles]{.underline}** that can be fired from aircraft or on land. A
former Russian deputy transport minister, Lushnikov once worked for
commodities tycoon Gennady Timchenko, a longtime friend of Putin. The
United States sanctioned Timchenko in 2014 following Russia's invasion
of Crimea, naming him as a member of the Kremlin's "inner circle."
Neither Lushnikov, Timchenko or the Kalashnikov Concern responded to
requests for comment. It's the [same]{.underline} pattern [with
Almaz-Antey Concern]{.underline}, a Moscow-based defense company
specializing in missiles and anti-aircraft systems. The company has been
sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK, but [CEO Yan Novikov has not
been punished]{.underline}. **[Almaz-Antey]{.underline}**'s website
displays the motto "Peaceful Sky is Our Profession." The company
**[makes Kalibr missiles]{.underline}**, **[which Russia's Ministry of
Defense has credited with destroying Ukrainian military
installations.]{.underline}** In a statement last month, the ministry
said Russia had fired long-range Kalibr missiles at a Ukrainian command
post near the village of Shyroka Dacha in eastern Ukraine, killing what
the ministry claimed were more than 50 generals and officers of the
Ukrainian military. Reuters was unable to independently verify that
claim. Neither Almaz-Antey nor CEO Novikov responded to requests for
comment. In response to a list of questions submitted by Reuters about
Western sanctions aimed at Russia, a Kremlin spokesperson said \"the
consistency and logic of imposing sanctions, as well as the legality of
imposing such restrictions, is a question that should be put directly to
the countries that introduced them.\" The Reuters findings come as
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that **[current Western
sanctions against Russia "are not enough]{.underline}**" as Russian
troops make gains in their assault on Ukraine's eastern regions of
Luhansk and Donetsk. The Ukrainian military has been outgunned by
Russian artillery in places such as the industrial city of
Sievierodonetsk, which it ceded to Russian forces last week after weeks
of intense fighting. Putin has portrayed his military's assault on
Ukraine as a "special military operation" aimed at demilitarizing and
"denazifying" its democratic neighbor. On Tuesday, Russia's Foreign
Ministry announced it would bar Jill Biden and Ashley Biden, the wife
and daughter of U.S. President Joe Biden, from entering Russia
indefinitely in what it said was a response to "constantly expanding
U.S. sanctions against Russian politicians and public figures." U.S.
National Security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday that Russia\'s
action was not surprising because \"the Russian capacity for these kinds
of cynical moves is basically bottomless.\" The Russian invasion has
killed thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, but the exact
number is unknown. The United Nations human rights office said, as of
Monday, that 4,731 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia's
invasion began on Feb. 24, including more than 300 children, with
another 5,900 civilians injured in the conflict. The agency said most of
the casualties were caused by the use of "explosive weapons with a wide
impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch
rocket systems, and missile and air strikes," and that the actual number
of dead and wounded was likely far higher. The West has levied sanctions
on a swath of Russia's economy to punish Moscow, an effort that so far
has done little to deter the Russian offensive. Like the bans on other
Russian firms, sanctions on weapons companies are meant to hamper their
ability to sell to foreign customers. These penalties limit their access
to imported components and generally make it more costly and
time-consuming to produce weaponry. **[Levying sanctions on the people
behind those firms goes a step further to make the pain
personal.]{.underline}** **[It allows Western nations to go
after]{.underline}** any mansions, yachts and other offshore
**[wealth]{.underline}** **[of those who supply Russia's military, and
it limits where they can travel abroad.]{.underline}** "You're
demonstrating that being a regime collaborator comes with a cost," said
Max Bergmann, a former State Department official during the Obama
administration who worked on U.S. arms transfers and safeguarding U.S.
military technology. "**[They feel it very personally]{.underline}**.
You're creating a disgruntled class of people that are tied to the
Kremlin," said Bergmann, now director of the Europe program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based
national security think tank. AMMUNITION MAKERS UNSCATHED **[Other
companies in Russia's defense industry]{.underline}** identified by
Reuters **[that have not been sanctioned]{.underline}** by the United
States, EU or UK [include the V.A. Degtyarev
Plant]{.underline}[(ZDEGI.MM)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ZDEGI.MM),
a facility 165 miles northeast of Moscow that makes machine guns,
anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that are sold to the Russian
military. [Its weapons include the Kalashnikov PKM and PKTM **machine
guns**, as well as Kord]{.underline} rifles [and machine **guns**, some
of which are mounted on **armored vehicles**.]{.underline} The Degtyarev

the Klimovsk Specialized Ammunition Plant]{.underline}, south of Moscow,
[where "world-famous **cartridges**" **for pistols** **and** Kalashnikov
**assault rifles are produced**]{.underline}, according to an archived
version of its website. Neither is the Novosibirsk Cartridge Plant, an
ammunition manufacturer that calls itself "one of the leading
engineering enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia."
Neither ammunition plant responded to requests for comment. Last month,
Reuters sought comments from sanctions officials in the UK, EU and
United States regarding the news agency's findings that they had failed
to punish a raft of Russian defense firms and tycoons fueling Putin's
war effort. As part of that process, Reuters provided those Western
authorities with a detailed list of more than 20 companies and more than
three-dozen people that had escaped sanctions. The UK's Foreign,
Commonwealth and Development Office, which levies sanctions for Britain,
said it could not comment on future sanctions. It added that London and
its allies had levied "the largest and most severe economic sanctions
that Russia has ever faced, to help cripple Putin's war machine." The
European Commission and the U.S. Treasury Department, which handle
sanctions for Brussels and Washington respectively, declined to comment
on the specifics of Reuters' findings. Elizabeth Rosenberg, assistant
secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes at the Treasury
Department, said in a statement that sanctions have "made it harder for
Russia to obtain what it needs to procure and produce weapons." On
Tuesday, in conjunction with a meeting of leaders of the G7 nations in
the German Alps, the Treasury Department released a new round of
defense-related sanctions that included eight of the weapons firms and
two of the executives on the list provided earlier by Reuters. One of
those newly sanctioned executives, Vladimir Artyakov, has played key
roles in Russia's weapons industry for decades, and serves as the No. 2
executive at Rostec, a military-industrial giant with hundreds of
subsidiaries employing more than half a million people, according to its
website and annual reports. **[Artyakov]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}

[among them Russian Helicopters JSC]{.underline}, **[which builds

Artyakov and Russian Helicopters did not respond to requests for
comment. Rostec has been sanctioned by Washington since 2014. On Tuesday
the United States targeted the company again, levying sanctions on more
than 40 Rostec subsidiaries and affiliates. Among those hit was
Avtomatika Concern, a company linked to cyber warfare. It was on the
list of Russian defense firms that Reuters had submitted to the Treasury
Department last month seeking an explanation as to why the companies had
not been sanctioned. Rostec and Avtomatika Concern did not respond to
requests for comment. Other firms on Reuters' list that were sanctioned
just this week by the Treasury Department include PJSC Tupolev, a maker
of fighter jets such as the Tu-22M3 bomber. The Ukrainian military said
Tu-22M3 bombers were responsible for a missile strike at a crowded
shopping center in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday,
which killed at least 18 people and injured about 60. PJSC Tupolev and
another firm on Reuters' list, JSC VNII Signal, have not been sanctioned
by the EU or UK. JSC VNII Signal is a producer of mechanical and
navigational systems that power Russian military tanks and some of the
country's most advanced missile systems. PJSC Tupolev and JSC VNII
Signal did not respond to requests for comment. TOP BRASS UNTOUCHED
**[Executives]{.underline}** at a host **[of Russian weapons
firms]{.underline}**, meanwhile, **[have largely escaped
sanctions]{.underline}** from Western authorities. Nearly three months
after a Tochka-U ballistic missile hit a train station in the eastern
Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk on April 8, Russian weapons executives
linked to the company that makes those missiles have yet to pay a price.
The strike killed more than 50 people, including children, and injured
more than 100 others. The Russian firm JSC Research and Production
Corporation Konstruktorskoye Byuro Mashynostroyeniya, known as KBM, has
been the primary manufacturer of Tochka-U missiles, according to a U.S.
Army database of worldwide military equipment. Neither Washington,
Brussels or London have sanctioned Sergey Pitikov, KBM's chief
executive. The **[three Western allies have likewise spared Alexander
Denisov]{.underline}**, the **[CEO of NPO High Precision
Systems]{.underline}**, **[KBM's parent company]{.underline}**. High
Precision Systems **[oversees production of a wide range of missiles,
artillery, grenade launchers and machine guns used by Russian
troop]{.underline}**s **[and outfitted on military helicopters,
aircraft, tanks and warships]{.underline}**. **[Sanctions on Russia's
arms companies and tycoons have been applied inconsistently by the
Western allies]{.underline}**. The United States and EU have sanctioned
High Precision Systems, for example, while the UK has not. The United
States has sanctioned KBM, but the EU and UK have not. High Precision
Systems, Pitikov and Denisov did not respond to requests for comment.
KBM confirmed that Pitikov is its chief executive, but did not respond
to additional questions submitted by Reuters. **[Europe and the United
States have failed to coordinate sanctions]{.underline}** **[even on
makers of banned weapons.]{.underline}** Since the outset of Russia's
invasion in late February, [Western governments and human rights groups
have decried its use of cluster munitions:]{.underline} small bombs
delivered by missiles or rockets, which scatter and explode over an area
as large as a city block. A 2008 international treaty bans their use or
production under any circumstances because of the devastating effects on
civilians. **[Russia used a Uragan]{.underline}** -- which translates to
"Hurricane" -- **[rocket launcher system to fire cluster
bombs]{.underline}** in Kharkiv on March 24, killing eight civilians and
injuring 15 others, according to the U.N. human rights office and
Ukrainian officials. **[The Uragan is made by JSC Scientific and
Production Association Splav,]{.underline}** a Russian firm whose
systems have been sold abroad to countries including India. The company
has been sanctioned by the United States, but not by the UK or EU.
**[Its CEO, Alexander Smirnov, has escaped sanctions
altogether.]{.underline}** Splav and Smirnov did not respond to requests
for comment. It's much the same for Splav's parent company, NPK
Techmash. The United States and the EU have sanctioned the firm, but the
UK has not. Techmash CEO Alexander Kochkin has not been targeted by
American or European authorities. Techmash and Kochkin did not respond
to requests for comment. In a June 10 statement, the European Commission
said there is an effort to align sanctions lists "as much as legally
possible" among allies to achieve "the maximum cumulative effect of the
sanctions with all our like-minded partners." In cases where the lists
do not align, the Commission statement said, people and companies not
currently on the EU's sanctions list could be added later if there is
sufficient evidence. \"Nothing is off the table,\" the statement said.
WESTERN CONNECTIONS One of [the highest-profile Russian
firms]{.underline} [to escape]{.underline} Western [sanctions
is]{.underline} [**VSMPO-Avisma
Corp**[(VSMO.MM)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/VSMO.MM),]{.underline}
**[which is the world's largest titanium supplier]{.underline}** and 25%
owned by Rostec. **[It supplies Russia's defense
industry]{.underline}**, but also counts major Western aerospace
companies among its clients. Based in Verkhnyaya Salda, in central
Russia, VSMPO-Avisma has subsidiaries with facilities in the United
States, Switzerland and the UK, as well as sales and distribution staff
in the United States, Europe and Asia, according to its website and
annual reports. That's no doubt a factor that has allowed the company to
escape punishment, according to three sanctions and Russian defense
experts who spoke with Reuters. VSMPO-Avisma's vice chairman and
majority shareholder, Russian billionaire Mikhail Shelkov, ranked by
Forbes this year as Russia's 59th-richest person, likewise has not been
sanctioned. According to past press releases, VSMPO-Avisma has long-term
contracts to supply titanium to United Aircraft Corp, a Rostec
subsidiary that oversees production of Russian fighter jets such as the
Su-34 that have been shot down in Ukraine. United Aircraft has been
sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK. VSMPO-Avisma also sells to
Europe's Airbus[(AIR.PA)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AIR.PA), and
it supplied U.S. aerospace behemoth Boeing
Co[(BA.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/BA.N) up until March, when
the Arlington, Virginia-based company said it stopped purchasing
titanium from Russia. Boeing had announced just months earlier, in
November 2021, that VSMPO-Avisma would be its largest titanium supplier
"for current and future Boeing commercial airplanes." VSMPO-Avisma and
shareholder Shelkov declined to comment. Boeing said in a statement that
it has worked since 2014 to diversify its sources of titanium around the
world, and that its current inventory and sources \"provide sufficient
supply for airplane production.\" Airbus did not answer specific
questions about its relationship with VSMPO-Avisma. But in an emailed
statement it said potential sanctions on Russian titanium "would
massively damage the entire aerospace industry in Europe" while doing
little to harm Russia because those sales are but a small portion of
that nation\'s overall exports. In 2020, foreign sales accounted for
about two-thirds of VSMPO-Avisma's \$1.25 billion in revenue, according
to the company's most recent annual report. That puts Western officials
in a tough spot, said Richard Connolly, director of Eastern Advisory
Group, a UK consultancy that advises governments and businesses on the
Russian economy and its defense industry. Slapping sanctions on
VSMPO-Avisma would curtail its lucrative export trade, but it would also
force major players in global aviation to switch suppliers or risk
sanctions themselves. "That's the classic sanctions conundrum: If you
want to hurt somebody, you're going to hurt yourself," Connolly said

**[U.S. and British officials believe]{.underline}** that damaging
**[international sanctions slapped on Russia]{.underline}** over its
full-scale invasion of Ukraine **[are hampering its ability to restock
high-tech weapons]{.underline}**, **[such as precision-guided
munitions]{.underline}**, though Russia still has plenty of conventional
ammunition stocks at its disposal to continue to wage war. **[The impact
of Russia's sanctions-induced high-tech military
shortages]{.underline}** **[have been spotted by Western
governments]{.underline}**, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has
ordered troops into the besieged steel factory in the city of Mariupol,
Ukraine, while **[Russian pilots have rained down "dumb bombs" without
advanced precision guidance kits]{.underline}** into the city. The
**[Russian military burned through much of its stockpile of advanced
weapons in the early days of the war]{.underline}**; the United States
believes Russia may have fired as many as 12 hypersonic missiles into
Ukraine. **[U.S.-led [export

announced in late February **[sought to starve Russia of computer chips
and semiconductors]{.underline}** that could be used in advanced
military equipment. "**[Our sanctions and export controls]{.underline}**
were designed to **[deny Russia the critical inputs it needs to continue
the war]{.underline}** against Ukraine **[and to degrade its ability to
project power in the future]{.underline}**," said Wally Adeyemo, deputy
secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department. "**[We have disrupted the
Russian military supply chain and overall production]{.underline}**,
inhibited its defense sector from settling payments,
**[and]{.underline}** **[will continue to target Russia's ability to
restock, resupply, and rebuild]{.underline}**." Since late February,
when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government has
designated 147 entities, 35 individuals, and 74 vessels operating in
Russia's defense sector, according to data from the Treasury Department.
Among the top targets of U.S. sanctions is the Tactical Missiles
Corporation, known as KTRV when transliterated and abbreviated. KTRV is
a Russian state-owned defense conglomerate that produces hypersonic
weapons and technology used in radar systems and other multipurpose
missiles. The Treasury Department has sanctioned a chief executive of
KTRV, Boris Obnosov, as well as 28 subsidiaries of the conglomerate.
Within Russia, there are already signs the sanctions are starting to cut
into the country's ability to restock its high-end systems. U.S.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Congress on Wednesday that
Ukrainian officials had told her that Russia was being forced to take
semiconductors from dishwashers and refrigerators for high-tech weapons.
Raimondo said U.S. technology exports to Russia had dropped by almost 70
percent since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Moscow set up an
interdepartmental committee to sort out how to source more military
equipment domestically and if so-called friendly countries---including
China---might be willing to work around sanctions to provide
microelectronic processors and ammunition, two of Russia's biggest
military needs. "We do believe that the **[sanctions and the export
controls]{.underline}**, particularly [when it comes to components,
electronic components]{.underline}, **[has had an effect on the Russian
defense industrial base and their ability to restart]{.underline}**
\[**[precision-guided munitions\]]{.underline}**," a senior U.S. defense
official told reporters this week. "It's definitely beginning to bite
into his defense industrial capabilities." A British Foreign,
Commonwealth, and Development Office spokesperson told Foreign Policy
that international sanctions had frozen 60 percent of Russia's foreign
currency reserves, nearly \$340 billion. Up to 70,000 computer
specialists left Russia in March, and another 100,000 were expected to.
"Persistent sanctions will lead to depressed long-term GDP growth as the
country is unable to access key Western technology," the spokesperson
said in an emailed statement. (Russian GDP could fall by up to 15
percent this year.) It's difficult to track the exact extent that
sanctions are hitting Russia's ability to rearm; Western officials speak
about the matter in broad terms but have not publicly offered specific
numbers due the sensitivity of the information. "We cannot publicly
comment on the specific impact that these measures are having on the
production of particular weapons systems or munitions Russia is using to
prosecute its war against Ukraine," a State Department spokesperson
said. The bite of Western sanctions seems to have forced Moscow to begin
dusting off Soviet-era defense stocks and use munitions that are less
accurate---and thus potentially deadlier to Ukrainian civilians caught
in the crossfire of Russia's clumsy military offensives. On Monday, the
British defense ministry's intelligence arm assessed that the depletion
of Russia's precision-guided stockpiles has "forced the use of readily
available but aging munitions that are less reliable, less accurate, and
more easily intercepted." The 77-day invasion has "revealed
shortcomings" in Russia's ability to conduct precision strikes,
including subjecting Ukraine's towns and villages to intense shelling, a
trend that seems to be on the rise in the offensive in the Donbas
region. Even if such ammunition is inferior to precision-guided
munitions, Russia has plenty of it to continue its military offensives.
"They will face problems on the security of supply on their
precision-guided missiles, some other high-tech elements, and weaponry,"
said one senior Eastern European defense official. "But at the same
time, **[we shouldn't discount their ability to wage war with simpler
stuff]{.underline}**. **[They have]{.underline}** enough
\[**[ammunition]{.underline}**\] for years and years **[for fighting on
that level]{.underline}** they're doing," the official added. Much of
Russia's defense industrial base has been under harsh U.S. sanctions
since 2014, during Russia's first invasion of Ukraine and illegal
annexation of Crimea. In late March, the Biden administration also
slapped
[sanctions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/24/fact-sheet-united-states-and-allies-and-partners-impose-additional-costs-on-russia/#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20United%20States%20is,with%20the%20EU%20and%20G7.)
on dozens of Russian defense companies beyond KTRV, including High
Precision Systems, which produces surface-to-air missiles such as the
Iskander and anti-tank missile systems, and Tekhmash, the producer of
many of the Russian military's ammunition, multiple rocket systems, and
unguided bombs. The Treasury Department has also targeted neighboring
Belarus's defense sector with its own sanctions packages. Belarusian
President Aleksandr Lukashenko, which has aligned his authoritarian
government with Moscow, supported the invasion and allowed Russian
troops to use his country to launch offensives and airstrikes across the
border into northern Ukraine in the early weeks of the war, before
Russia's effort to capture Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, failed. **[The U.S.
Commerce Department rolled out new export control restrictions aimed at
stopping Russia from getting U.S.-made technology]{.underline}** that
could be used in military hardware, even if that technology is supplied
by third countries. **[This includes microelectronics,
telecommunications, information security equipment, sensors, navigation
equipment, avionics, and parts for civilian aircraft.]{.underline}** But
much of the U.S. effort to stop Russia's military supply lines from
humming relies on extensive export controls that lean on the newly made
Foreign Direct Product Rule to block almost any products made with U.S.
software or technology. The problem with depending on that rule, former
officials told Foreign Policy, is that it leans heavily on foreign
countries to make enforcement calls. And the United States has
limited---if any---visibility on products that are actually reaching
Russia. "My huge, huge concern is that we do not have end use checks in
Russia," said Nazak Nikakhtar, a former assistant secretary of commerce
during the Trump administration and now a partner at Wiley Rein, a law
firm. "We do not have U.S. officials that can go to the Russian entities
to figure out even if there's an export license that has been granted.
We have nobody to go in there and do an audit to see that that's
happened." There's another potential end-around, Nikakhtar said: China.
The U.S. rival could help supply critical minerals needed to make steel
and aluminum for military equipment as well as microchips needed to help
guide precision missiles to their targets. But even if Russia is able to
find other suppliers for military components, as some expect, it is
likely to face an increasingly steep economic cliff as the invasion of
Ukraine continues. Speaking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday,
British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said Western sanctions would pose
a "real challenge" to Russia's ability to refurbish his "worn out" armed
forces. And even though the Kremlin has managed to stabilize the ruble
with energy exports, it is not likely to be able to stave off the
financial pain for long. "Russia is probably spending almost everything
it's earning on its energy exports to prop up the ruble and, you know,
do all sorts of other B.S. to make it seem like the economy is okay when
it's not," said Brian O'Toole, a nonresident senior fellow with the
Atlantic Council think tank and a former Treasury Department official.
"They're making hard choices now," he added. "It's frustrating for folks
not to see all of the results, but this is unsustainable for the
Russians. At some point, they're just going to fall off a cliff."

**[remember]{.underline}** **[the great accomplishments achieved when

**[in]{.underline}** the field of **[technology]{.underline}** over the
past 40 years. During the rapprochement in the 1970s, cooperation in
technology spanned over fields like energy, health, basic research in
physics and chemistry, and civil industrial technology, among others
that could easily be considered sensitive areas by current standards.
Academic exchanges also thrived: the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology has hosted thousands of Chinese scientists
since the 1980s. The U.S. National Science Foundation also [sent U.S.
scholars](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/st-fact-sheet.pdf)

mistrust]{.underline}**. The U.S. [urged its
allies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-23/u-s-urges-key-allies-to-avoid-using-huawei-equipment-wsj-says)

technology crown jewel, Huawei. Renowned scholars were
[sanctioned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-28/harvard-university-professor-accused-of-lying-about-china-ties)
for involvement in technological research sponsored by the other
nation's government. **[Some people may view the deterioration of the
U.S.-China technology exchange simply as a trade-off between national
security and innovation.]{.underline}** However, **[the contesting
philosophies of technological protectionism and globalism is the more
fundamental issue at play]{.underline}**. This paper discusses the past,
present, and future of US-China technology cooperation in three
dimensions. 1.) Why has technological cooperation deteriorated? 2.) How
is reviving cooperation beneficial to both countries? 3.) Is it possible
to restore trust against the backdrop of U.S.-China competition? Why has
U.S.-China cooperation in technology deteriorated? The reasons for
deterioration lie in the rapid development of technology in both
countries. On the one hand, China's technological capacity has been
advancing rapidly. Harvard Economics Professor Richard Freeman
[accredited China
with](https://economics.harvard.edu/files/economics/files/bigger_than_you_thought_chinas_contribution_journal_china_and_world_economy_xie-freeman_jan2019.pdf)
36 percent of global scientific articles in 2016 and 37 percent of
citations to scientific articles in 2013, which is two times more than
China's share of global population or GDP. The time to turn research
into commercial applications has also shortened. In November 2019, China
had already
[launched](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/tech/5g-china/index.html) 5G
services in 50 cities. The companies that run 5G services are none other
but China's three state-run telecom giants\--China Mobile, China
Telecom, and China Unicom\--reinforcing the United States' concerns that
Chinese government is closely involved in China's cutting-edge
technologies. On the other hand, technology has also developed by leaps
and bounds in the United States. In the past, only a few high-stake,
dual-use technologies would spark national security concerns. In
addition, these technologies often had military applications. Yet as
technological applications proliferated and interfaced pervasively with
people's everyday lives, even dating applications can now collect
personal data that warrants regulators' concerns. Increasingly, the
United States finds itself vulnerable in many new technological fields
that were not formerly considered sensitive. Most fundamentally,
U.S.-China technology cooperation has shifted from unilateral to
bilateral. In the past, the U.S. was typically the provider of capital
and technological know-how while China was the receiver. For the United
States, technological assistance to China was partly an exercise in
[science
diplomacy](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Trends%20in%20US-China%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Cooperation.pdf).
Since the U.S. surpassed China in technological capacity by a wide
margin, exchanging technology assets for diplomatic objectives made
political sense for the United States. Moreover, in the past, U.S.-China
technological cooperation was often rolled out in formal settings.
Cooperation usually took place between government agencies or
government-affiliated research institutions, which enabled the U.S. to
control the extent of the technological knowledge that was transferred
to China. In recent years, however, China has started exporting capital
and talent to the United States as well. Chinese technology giants
Alibaba and Baidu established Artificial Intelligence research labs in
California, where they collaborated with U.S. scholars and institutions.
Chinese companies poured capital into U.S. technology companies. In the
first quarter of 2014 alone, Chinese investors struck [high-tech
deals](https://asiasociety.org/files/China_Hi_Tech_Report.pdf) worth
over six billion dollars, including the takeovers of Motorola Mobility
and IBM's x86 server unit. With the rise of Chinese talent and capital,
the exchange of technological know-how between the United States and
China now takes place among private businesses and between individuals:
an exchange that is impossible for the United States to fully control.
The changing nature of technological cooperation has made both countries
reconsider the political costs and benefits. Meanwhile, as nationalist
sentiments rise on a global scale, technology has become a convenient
medium to strike a political point. Hence, it comes as no surprise that
backlash against U.S.-China technological cooperation gradually comes to
the mainstream. Technological protectionism has temporarily prevailed
against technological globalism. Why is reviving technological
cooperation beneficial to both United States and China? **[The United
States and China should not let technological protectionism
persist]{.underline}**, **[as cooperation has proven valuable to both
sides]{.underline}**. [These benefits are evident whether cooperation is
organized through **government-sponsored programs** or through **private
companies and individuals**.]{.underline} Th**[e [U.S.-China Clean
Energy Research
Center](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/04/f34/1_Zhou%2C%20Nan_CERC%20Overview.pdf)
(CERC) is a quintessential example of the value of technology
cooperation through government-sponsored programs]{.underline}**.
Initiated at the presidential level in 2009, CERC aims to achieve a
large-scale adoption of energy efficient buildings backed up by
cutting-edge technologies. **[Through the collective effort of and
researchers in the United States and China]{.underline}**, **[CERC has
launched high-tech products]{.underline}** including daylight
redirecting windows, trilogy integrated heat pumps and co-axial ground
heat exchangers that are reported to consume 14 to 30 percent less
energy than conventional products. In addition, **[CERC also published
multiple copyrighted software applications]{.underline}** and are on the
path to file joint intellectual properties on behalf of research teams
from both countries. **[CERC is just one example]{.underline}** **[of
the vast potential that U.S.-China cooperation]{.underline}** **[can
unleash]{.underline}**, especially in fields that concern both
countries. As acknowledged in a [U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission
report](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Trends%20in%20US-China%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Cooperation.pdf),
the U.S. gained research access to important facilities in China and
communicated with China's leading scientists through various scientific
initiatives. Needless to say, **[China also obtained a great amount of
technological experience and know-how by collaborating with the United
States]{.underline}**. The two countries have only more to gain when
their technology cooperation is carried out on a business-to-business or
individual-to-individual level. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
[estimates](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/stem-crisis-or-stem-surplus-yes-and-yes.htm)
a need for approximately one million more Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) professionals than the U.S.
currently produces to retain its own preeminence in technology. And over
the years, **[China has consistently been the leading source of STEM
students enrolled in the United States]{.underline}**. Moreover, surveys
of U.S. National Science Foundation [shows
that](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11347) **[90
percent of Chinese scholars still work in the U.S.]{.underline}** ten
years after receiving their doctoral degrees in STEM. **[These scholars
power innovation]{.underline}** in Silicon Valley, **[expediting the
creation of technological applications that benefit millions of people
in the United States]{.underline}**. **[The benefit of cooperating with
the United States on a business-to-business or individual-to-individual
level is also obvious for China]{.underline}**. For instance, through
**[joint ventures]{.underline}**, **[medical companies]{.underline}**
**[in the United States have brought innovative treatments to China's
vast healthcare market]{.underline}** that cover a wide array of complex
diseases like influenza, diabetes, and hypertension. How do we restore
trust in technology cooperation against the backdrop of U.S.-China
competition? **[Restoring U.S.-China technological cooperation will
benefit the people of both countries]{.underline}**. As the U.S.-China
relationship is currently characterized by tension and mistrust, leaders
in each country need to firmly express their determination to restore
cooperation with their counterpart. They must co-develop strategic
solutions to achieve this shared goal. First, **[the U.S. and China need
to identify common interests,]{.underline}** search for shared problems,
and capitalize on existing relationships in those areas. For example, as
Professor Lan Xue at Tsinghua University and Denis Simon at Arizona
State University
[suggested](https://www.chinausfocus.com/2022/wp-content/uploads/Part-02-Chapter-122.pdf),
the Integrated Gas-steam Combined Cycle field could be a potential
opportunity to expand ties between the two countries. In this field,
China appears to have the strongest technology in coal-gas
transformation, while the United States ranks first in the world in
steam turbine technology. The two countries could share their
technological advantages to achieve a win-win outcome. Second, the U.S.
and China need to enhance bilateral agreements that address pressing
issues like intellectual property protection. Such agreements should
contain clear protocols that guide the handling of sensitive data,
specify the process of transferring technical knowledge, and establish
corresponding auditing procedures. In addition, **[each country needs to
do its part to address the other party's core concerns]{.underline}**.
As scholars from the Asia Society
[recommended](https://asiasociety.org/files/China_Hi_Tech_Report.pdf),
China has to further unleash its private sector and give businesses more
freedom to make investment decisions that are unconstrained by the
government. If China is willing to take bold steps to empower its
private enterprises, the United States will be less concerned about the
politicization of Chinese investments. Meanwhile, U.S. regulators should
evaluate foreign investments in technology sectors based on the
investors' compliance history rather than their nationality. While all
the aforementioned suggestions are by no means easy to achieve, each
small step in the right direction can go a long way to make
technological exchanges between the United States and China more
transparent and open. **[History reveals that technological
protectionism and globalism often take turns to dominate the mainstream
political narrative]{.underline}**. While neither is categorically
better than the other, most would agree with that rapid innovations
needs a certain level of collaboration to sprout. **[As the world awaits
the two great powers to bring more technology advancement to mankind, it
behooves the United States and China to continue close
cooperation]{.underline}**.

uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic and protectionism. The media
event comes as China's top leadership conclude an important policy
meeting aimed at setting the country's economic and social priorities
for the next five years. **[The officials particularly pushed back

by U.S. restrictions in the last two years. "[Decoupling is basically
not realistic, and there's no benefit for China or the
U.S]{.underline}., or the entire world," said Han Wenxiu, deputy
director at the Office of the Central Commission for Financial and
Economic Affairs. That's according to a CNBC translation of his
Mandarin-language remarks. "[Those who want decoupling are
few]{.underline}. **[Those who want collaboration are far
more]{.underline}**," Han said, noting that the U**[.S. and China are
only able to be the world's two largest economies since they complement
each other and operate in an open global environment]{.underline}**.
President Xi is bracing for a 'combative' period ahead with China's
five-year plan The U.S. is China's largest trade partner, but the two
countries have been locked in tensions for more than two years. Each
government has levied tariffs on goods worth hundreds of billions of
dollars from the other country. Critics say the dominance of the state
in China's economy gives it unfair advantages over American companies
and other foreign businesses. Economists expect China to become the
world's largest economy in the next few years, surpassing the U.S. In an
effort to reduce economic dependency on debt-fueled investment and
manufacturing of goods for export, China has been trying to increase its
reliance on domestic consumption. Foreign trade still accounts for about
30% of China's gross domestic product, according to Han, who noted a
decline from 60% previously. "Looking ahead, China's imports and
exports, use of foreign capital, and scale of investment overseas will
expand, and international status will rise," he said. "This is also an
important characteristic of a large country's economy." 'Self-reliance'
in technology Han and four other central government officials were
speaking a day after the [release of preliminary

also known as the 14th Five-Year Plan. This week's meeting of the
central committee of China's ruling Communist Party also addressed goals
for the year 2035. The meeting emphasized China's need to pursue
"self-reliance" in technology as a strategy for national development,
according to [state
media.](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-10/29/c_1126674147.htm)

Again, while describing China's need to pursue a new phase of
development, officials were quick to point out how the country needed to
learn from international expertise. "China's technological innovation
has never been closed innovation, and in the future it will not close
its doors to innovate on its own," Science and Technology Minister Wang
Zhigang said during Friday's press conference, according to a CNBC
translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. Aim to build a 'modern'
society In the release about goals for 2035, China's leaders said they
would focus on building a "modern socialist China" that includes
modernization of national defense and the military. The emphasis on
"modern" comes after the ruling party said Thursday it will basically
achieve its promise of building a "[moderately prosperous
society"](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1079510.shtml) by next
year, when the Chinese Communist Party celebrates its 100th anniversary.
The release also said that Beijing expects GDP to top 100 trillion yuan
(about \$14.9 trillion) this year, which would imply an increase of at
least 0.9% from 2019′s level. Longer term, authorities said China aims
to become "a strong country in culture, education, talent, sports and
health."

<https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2020/number/1/article/populism-root-causes-power-grabbing-and-counter-strategy.html>

A strategy for overcoming populism in four steps To stop support for
populists and put an end to their power is no easy task. The root
problems, which had empowered the populists, have not vanished, and the
incapacity of former mainstream parties to solve problems has not been
forgotten. Support for populists eventually fades if the economic
situation worsens -- as the electoral results in main cities in Turkey
and Hungary show. However, if there is no candidate presenting an
alternative or opposition is divided, the return to liberal democracy is
difficult, given the new majority rules and suppression of the media. A
four-stage procedure is needed. [The first step is to correct the wrong
framing on which today's populism is based]{.underline}. It is the
pessimistic interpretation that life has become bad, the economy is
approaching a collapse, and moral and social relations are worse than in
some golden era. In fact, in most countries and regions, living
conditions were not dismal at the time the populists came to power.
Incomes were higher than those of the previous generation, there was a
greater ability to choose education, training and location. The best
proof that an overly pessimistic story is incorrect is perhaps rising
life expectancy: it increases by three years for each decade after we
were born, and it is largely a healthy life expectancy that includes the
ability to work, travel and seek a partner up to an age that had
previously been unimaginable. In rebalancing the framework it has to be
acknowledged, that not everything is positive for everyone and the
potential for improvement is great. [Inequality can be decreased,
employment made fairer with less burnout, and leisure choices can
increase.]{.underline} It must be made clear that [these improvements
will never happen through protectionism,]{.underline} and that past jobs
and family structures will not return. Furthermore, it needs to be
stressed that heterogeneity is not negative and animosity towards
outsiders or foreigners does not solve problems. Redrawing the picture
without whitewashing must be the starting point of a new policy. The
second step is to [develop a vision outlining where the country or
region wants to be in the]{.underline} medium-term [future]{.underline},
for example by 2030. This includes which [jobs can be
created]{.underline}, which specialisations by industry are feasible and
advantageous, and which abilities and education levels for the young can
be attained. The vision should specify which public services are to be
provided and how living conditions can be improved. Performance should
be judged based on sustainable development
goals.[7](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2020/number/1/article/populism-root-causes-power-grabbing-and-counter-strategy.html#footnote-001)
[The vision should be ambitious but within reach, shared by citizens and
developed jointly with experts and political parties.]{.underline} The
third step is to define game-changing instruments and find partners in
the process of
change.[8](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2020/number/1/article/populism-root-causes-power-grabbing-and-counter-strategy.html#footnote-000)
Changing tax systems are all-important as they can make environmental
exploitation costly while supporting a circular economy and innovation.
Lifelong learning and retraining should be further promoted. [The
strategy should be discussed and fine-tuned in a dialogue with citizens,
NGOs, reform-minded trade unions and representatives]{.underline} of new
firms. Moreover, the skills of migrants should be utilised and their
children integrated. The increase in spatial divergence has to be
stopped. The flocking to urban centres should be curtailed through
teleworking and teleconferencing. Buying ever bigger cars fuelled by
gasoline or diesel should be discouraged through better public
transport, incentives for electric cars and car sharing, and the renting
of unused houses should replace urban sprawl. [Finally, a new strategy
requires a narrative that emotionalises and unites Europe.]{.underline}
Europe's [old peace narrative no longer moves its citizens, though each
and every day we see that peace is not a guarantee]{.underline}. Since
Europe is a small geographical region and Europe's share of the world
population is proportional in size, this [must be a narrative based on
quality, innovation and partnership.]{.underline} A probable new
narrative could be that [Europe is trying to make globalisation
responsible, taking the lead in fighting climate change and offering a
larger variety]{.underline}. It can further aspire to the lowest
inequality for its citizens, encouraging the extension of this European
way of life. Change is around the corner [Fighting populism is a
necessity]{.underline}. Populism reduces life opportunities, promising a
return to non-existent past glory. It leads to lower income and higher
expenditures for people unable to find jobs and a self-determined life.
It increases the probability of conflict with neighbours. Under
populism, government expenditures for policy, border control,
environmental degradation and health problems must increase
significantly, and this in turn leads to higher taxes and debt. It has
multiple roots which must be addressed, but there exist numerous better
solutions for these problems if they are discussed with citizens. [While
support for populism seems to have peaked, **an active policy is still
needed to ensure its continued decline.**]{.underline} Fortunately, the
new president of the European Commission and her team are addressing
these problems, with the support of new leaders at the IMF, the UN and
the ECB. Economists seem to have partly descended from their ivory tower
to include societal and environmental problems in their agenda, with GDP
substituted by Sustainable Development Goals. New interdisciplinary
think tanks are on the rise, and these are connected to international
networks stimulating discussion. Young **[people are more interested
than ever in the future of the planet]{.underline}** and infecting their
parents and teachers with their concerns. [New political parties are
being created on a basis other than that of the old
socialist-vs-conservative divide, and governments are becoming greener,
more liberal and more attentive to future opportunities
opportunities]{.underline} and partnerships with neighbours in the East
and in the South.

\[**Freedom House** **No date** \"Policy Recommendations: Strengthening
Democracy\",
https://freedomhouse.org/policy-recommendations/strengthening-democracy-abroad//
KS\]

[Recommendations for Democracies]{.underline} Democracies should work to
support their core principles at home and around the world. The
following recommendations are intended to provide a framework for
democratic countries as they pursue this goal. Strengthen and protect
core values Respect, protect, and fulfill human rights at home. Attacks
by elected leaders on democratic institutions---including the press, an
independent judiciary, and anti-corruption agencies---and on the rights
of minorities and migrants undermine faith in democracy around the
world. Democratic leaders should demonstrate respect for fundamental
norms at home by adhering to domestic legislation in line with
international human rights laws and standards, and refraining from
rhetoric that undermines these standards. Strengthen public support for
democratic principles by investing in civic education. To protect
freedom domestically and build support for a foreign policy that
protects democratic rights and values abroad, it is essential to foster
a stronger public understanding of democratic principles, especially
among young people. In the United States, new legislation could require
each state to develop basic content and benchmarks of achievement for
civic education, including instruction on the fundamental tenets of US
democracy. In the absence of new legislation, the US Department of
Education should, to the extent possible, make funding available to
states for civic education that focuses on democratic principles. Guard
against manipulation by authoritarian actors [Increase transparency
requirements for foreign state-owned propaganda outlets operating in
democratic states.]{.underline} Outlets like Russia's RT and China's
CGTN spread government-approved narratives without clearly disclosing
that they are government financed. [Measures to improve transparency
could include reporting requirements for media outlets' spending on paid
advertorials]{.underline} (advertisements designed to resemble an
independent, objective news article), ownership structures, and other
economic ties to repressive state actors. [Require social media
companies to report foreign efforts to spread online disinformation and
propaganda.]{.underline} Social media companies should be [required to
report regularly to target governments on **efforts by foreign
governments** and nonstate actors **to manipulate public opinion and
undercut democratic values by spreading disinfo**rmation and propaganda
on their platforms]{.underline}. In the United States, the government
should assess which entities would be the most appropriate to receive
these reports, since this information is of interest across
jurisdictions, including to intelligence agencies, Congress, the US
State Department's Global Engagement Center, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and the Department of Justice. The US government should
carefully decide on the types and sizes of social media companies
required to comply, the data they must submit, and appropriate penalties
for noncompliance. The entity receiving the information should report
findings regularly to the public and make the data publicly available,
while ensuring the protection of users' privacy. Address the use of bots
on social media. Bots (automated accounts pretending to be real people)
can be used to distort the online media environment by rapidly spreading
false information, fomenting discord, and drowning out independent
reporting and factual information. Democracies should address the use of
bots in social media manipulation. In the United States, the proposed
Bot Disclosure and Accountability Act (S. 2125) would authorize the
Federal Trade Commission to require the conspicuous and public
disclosure of bots intended to replicate human activity. **[Preventing
election interference.]{.underline}** Efforts should include [protecting
elections from cyberattacks through the use of paper ballots and
election audits,]{.underline} and improving transparency and oversight
of online political advertisements. In the United States, Congress
should pass and the president should sign the Honest Ads Act (S.
1356/H.R. 2592), which would modernize existing laws by applying
disclosure requirements to online political advertising. Strengthening
laws that guard against foreign influence over government officials.
Legislative proposals requiring greater transparency about officials'
personal finances and campaign donations, more rigorous standards for
the disclosure of conflicts of interest, and the establishment of a
clear code of conduct for engagement with foreign officials can help
insulate governments from foreign attempts to subvert democratic
institutions. In the United States, this could include passing
legislation to enforce the principles of the constitution's foreign
emoluments clause, closing loopholes in rules on reporting foreign
influence, and modernizing financial disclosure requirements for elected
officials. Preventing corrupt foreign officials from laundering stolen
assets through democracies. Corrupt actors steal more than \$3 trillion
annually from their home countries, the effects of which undermine
institutions critical to democracy and harm economic growth in these
countries. Stolen funds are routinely funneled through international
financial markets, laundered via seemingly legitimate purchases in
democratic nations. These practices pose a risk to the reputations of
companies unwittingly involved and to financial markets overall.
Democracies should strengthen transparency laws to ensure that accurate
identifying information about purchasers and their funding sources is
available. Governments should ensure robust enforcement of laws and
investigate and prosecute violators when necessary.

## Russian Aggression

### 1NC -- Russian Aggression - CP

#### Text: The United States federal government should completely remove Russia from The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.

[[As Western governments threaten Russia with a package of]{.mark}
unprecedented [sanctions aimed at deterring]{.mark} President Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark} from ordering an invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine[,
there\'s [one measure]{.mark} in particular [that]{.mark} [appears to
**strike fear at the heart of the Kremlin**]{.mark}: **[cutting the
country off from the global banking system.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[US [lawmakers]{.mark} have [suggested]{.mark} in recent weeks that
[Russia could be removed from SWIFT]{.mark}, a high security
network]{.underline} that connect thousands of financial institutions
around the world.

[Senior Russian lawmakers have responded by saying that shipments of
oil, gas and metals to Europe would stop if that happened]{.underline}.

\"If Russia is disconnected from SWIFT, then we will not receive
\[foreign\] currency, but buyers, European countries in the first place,
will not receive our goods --- oil, gas, metals and other important
components,\" Nikolai Zhuravlev, vice speaker of Russia\'s upper house
of parliament, said Tuesday, according to state media outlet TASS.

What is SWIFT?

[**The [S]{.mark}ociety for [W]{.mark}orldwide [I]{.mark}nterbank
[F]{.mark}inancial [T]{.mark}elecommunication** was founded in 1973 to
replace the telex and is now [used by over 11,000 financial
institutions]{.mark} to send secure messages and payment
orders]{.underline}. With **[[no]{.mark} globally accepted
[alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[it is essential]{.mark}
plumbing [for global finance]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[Removing Russia]{.mark} from SWIFT would **make it nearly impossible
for financial institutions to send money in or out of the country**,
**[delivering]{.mark} a [sudden shock to Russian companies]{.mark}** and
their foreign customers]{.underline} --- especially buyers of oil and
gas exports denominated in US dollars.

[\"The cutoff would **terminate all international transactions**,
**[trigger currency volatility]{.mark}, and cause massive capital
outflows**]{.underline},\" Maria Shagina, a visiting fellow at the
Finnish Institute of International Affairs, wrote in a paper last year
for Carnegie Moscow Center. [[Excluding Russia]{.mark} from SWIFT would
**[cause its economy to shrink by 5%,]{.mark}** former finance minister
Alexei Kudrin estimated in 2014.]{.underline}

SWIFT is based in Belgium and governed by a board consisting of 25
people, including Eddie Astanin, chairman of the management board at
Russia\'s Central Counterparty Clearing Centre. SWIFT, which describes
itself as a \"neutral utility,\" is incorporated under Belgian law and
must comply with EU regulations.

What happens if Russia is removed?

There is precedent for removing a country from SWIFT.

[\"SWIFT is a neutral global cooperative set up and operated for the
collective benefit of its community,\"]{.underline} the organization
said in a statement Wednesday. \"[Any decision to impose sanctions on
countries or individual entities rests solely with the competent
government bodies and applicable legislators]{.underline},\" it added.

It\'s not clear how much support there is among US allies for taking
similar action against Russia. The United States and Germany have the
most to lose if Russia is disconnected, because their banks are the most
frequent SWIFT users to communicate with Russian banks, according to
Shagina.

[The European Central Bank has warned lenders with significant exposure
to Russia to prepare for sanctions against Moscow]{.underline},
according to the Financial Times. ECB officials have also asked [banks
how they would respond to scenarios including a move to prevent Russian
banks accessing SWIFT.]{.underline}

The European Union is ready to respond to a Russian invasion of Ukraine
with \"comprehensive sanctions never seen before,\" Danish foreign
minister Jeppe Kofod said on Monday. EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell
said Tuesday that sanctions would be \"the most consequential leverage
that the West, or at least the European Union, has.\"

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told lawmakers on Tuesday that his
government was discussing the possibility of banning Russia from SWIFT
with the United States.

[[SWIFT unplugged Iran]{.mark}ian banks [in 2012]{.mark} after they were
sanctioned by the European Union over the country\'s nuclear
program]{.underline}. [[Iran lost]{.mark} almost [half of its oil export
revenue]{.mark} and 30% of foreign trade following the
disconnection]{.underline}, according to Shagina.

[\"**There is [no doubt that]{.mark} that [would be a very potent weapon

[One [sanction]{.mark} that [West]{.mark}ern allies were [hesitant to
impose]{.mark} on Russia]{.underline} \-- for fear of blowback to their

sanction is [cut]{.mark}ting [off]{.mark} [banks from SWIFT]{.mark}, the
messaging system used by financial institutions globally to convey
instructions to carry out tens of millions of transactions each
day]{.underline}. Most major Russian banks did end up being cut off,
underscoring Russia's isolation as a global pariah and prompting its
government to try to steer business with its remaining friends to its
own, much smaller version of SWIFT. China, too, has been trying to
develop a SWIFT alternative as part of its campaign to decrease its
dependence on the Western financial system and use of the dollar.

1\. What is SWIFT?

SWIFT \-- the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication \-- is a member-owned cooperative, based just outside
Brussels, founded in 1973 to end reliance on the telex system for
banking communications. As the Gmail of global banking, [[SWIFT]{.mark}
delivers secure messages among more than 11,000 financial institutions
and companies in over 200 countries and territories, [directing
trillions]{.mark} of dollars in transactions.]{.underline} The message
traffic \-- 42 million a day on average last year \-- includes orders
and confirmations for payments, trades and currency exchanges. SWIFT is
overseen by the National Bank of Belgium and representatives from the
U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England, the European Central
Bank, the Bank of Japan and other major central banks.

2\. Why is losing SWIFT access such a big deal?

[A [country whose]{.mark} banking [system is cut off]{.mark} from SWIFT
has a [very difficult time moving money]{.mark}, and thus goods, in or
out, and can thus **[suffer]{.mark} [significant economic
pain]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** When Western nations threatened
Russia's access to SWIFT in 2014, Alexei Kudrin, a onetime finance
minister close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, [estimated that it
could reduce Russia's gross domestic product by 5% in a
year.]{.underline} Iran's banks lost access to SWIFT in 2012 as part of
European Union sanctions targeting the country's nuclear program and its
sources of finance. Many of the banks were reconnected in 2016 after the
EU took them off its sanctions list.

3\. Who's been banned?

[In March, the [US]{.mark} and the EU [cut off]{.mark} seven [Russian
banks from SWIFT]{.mark}. They included state-controlled VTB, Bank
Rossiya and Bank Otkritie. **[Russia's biggest bank]{.mark}, Sberbank
PJSC, [was allowed to stay]{.mark} on SWIFT**]{.underline}, as was
Gazprombank JSC, a key bank for Russia's energy conglomerates. On June
3, the EU added three more banks including Sberbank, which has twice as
many assets as any other bank in Russia. Sberbank's international
operations were already heavily restricted after the U.S. and the U.K.
froze its local assets and ordered their banks to stop working with it.

4[. Why the reluctance to cut off all Russian banks from
SWIFT]{.underline}?

[Germany, which relies on Russia for more than half its gas supplies and
more than a third of its oil, in particular **resisted adding Sberbank**
to the list]{.underline}. Sberbank is a major conduit for EU-Russia
trade, and if the Russians couldn't get paid for their fuel, they could
be counted on to stop providing it.

5\. [What was the **[impact of]{.mark} the SWIFT
[cutoffs]{.mark}**?]{.underline}

[[Russia's economy and society]{.mark} are being [hit by so many
different sanctions]{.mark}, and by the war itself, that it's difficult
to disentangle their effects.]{.underline} Adding to the challenge,
Russian banks suspended monthly reporting of financial information when
the war began. According to a March 31 report by independent Russian
news agency Interfax, the [central bank estimated that [Russia]{.mark}n
banks may [lose]{.mark} as much as 5.8 trillion rubles ([\$93.8
billion]{.mark}) in 2022 due to sanctions]{.underline} and from
participating in measures to support the economy. Bloomberg News
reported in May that an internal forecast by [Russia's Finance Ministry
envisioned gross domestic product shrinking as much as 12% this year.
The **Finance Ministry called the report inaccurate.**]{.underline}

6\. [Is there an [alternative to SWIFT?]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**[Not really]{.mark}**, or at least not yet.]{.underline} Since 2014,
the Bank of Russia has run its own financial messaging system for
Russian and foreign banks, known by the acronym SPFS. Governor Elvira
Nabiullina told parliament in April that 52 institutions from 12
countries were participating. In March, Moscow was said to be urging
India, which had declined to impose sanctions on Russia, to use the
system as a way to continue making payments for oil and weapons.
[Digital currencies and their underlying technology have been touted as
a threat to SWIFT for several years, but **first they'd need to prove
they're a credible and secure alternative**]{.underline}. China has a
payment system known as the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or
CIPS, but it's mainly a settlement system for renminbi transactions that
also offers some communication functions. Most banks that use CIPS still
communicate via SWIFT.

### 2NC -- China

#### Heavier sanctions now deter Russia from [further]{.underline} attack [AND]{.underline} other deter China from initiating attack in the future

**Hufbauer 22** \[PIIE, 3-16-2022, \"How effective are sanctions against
Russia?,\"
https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/how-effective-are-sanctions-against-russia,

[[Sanctions against Russia]{.mark} for invading Ukraine are the [most
comprehensive]{.mark} imposed against a major power [since]{.mark} the
[Second World War]{.mark}. But are they effective]{.underline}? They
plainly [[have not deterred Russia]{.mark} [from]{.mark} making
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}. But answering that question in a
comprehensive way requires the distinction among four stages of
effectiveness, including whether they prevent something bad from
happening. The classic objectives of economic sanctions can be grouped
similarly to the objectives of criminal justice: do they [deter bad
behavior, but also can they be enforced, are their punishments
effective, and do they lead to changed behavior by the targeted
countries]{.underline}? [Deterrence, enforcement,
punishment]{.underline}, and rehabilitation are classic objectives of
criminal justice, and they [apply equally to economic
sanctions]{.underline}.

[Although deterrence clearly failed to stop Russia\'s aggression, the
[sanctions imposed after]{.mark} the Russian [invasion]{.mark} of
Ukraine could [still **deter other countries like China**]{.mark} **from
undermining the sanctions**]{.underline}. The sanctions may also
[**deter China [from carrying]{.mark} out its own [aggressive acts
against Taiwan]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As for effectiveness, the
[sanctions have proven among the **most powerful in modern
history**]{.underline}, largely because so many countries have gone
along with them. [The [punishment to]{.mark} the [Russian
economy]{.mark}, and to rich and poor Russians individually, has also
been [extraordinarily severe]{.mark}]{.underline}. But nearly three
weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, there is not the slightest evidence
that Moscow will change course and \"rehabilitate\" itself in the eyes
of the West.

FIRST STAGE: DETERRENCE

As Sun Tzu declared 2,500 years ago, \"[The **[greatest victory]{.mark}
is that which [requires no battle]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" Deterrence
through [threatened sanctions is a modern application of the general\'s
wisdom]{.underline}, and the first stage of effectiveness. On December
7, 2021, well before Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the
Donetsk People\'s Republic and the Luhansk People\'s Republic (carved
out of Ukrainian territory on February 21, 2022), President Joseph R.
[Biden, Jr. threatened \"**high impact\" sanctions** but did not make a
public commitment by disclosing specifics]{.underline}. Unfortunately,
Western threats failed to convey the extent and certainty of sanctions
awaiting the Russian invasion.

[Many [experts argue]{.mark} that [if]{.mark} President [Biden]{.mark}
and European leaders had **[declared in advance]{.mark},** in public,
and in detail [the]{.mark} path-breaking [sanctions]{.mark} now imposed
on Russia**, [Putin]{.mark} might have
[reconsider]{.mark}ed**]{.underline}. But advance threats from
Washington and European capitals were ambiguous and deterrence failed,
perhaps because [Putin grossly underestimated not only Ukrainian
opposition but also the worldwide condemnation and punishment evoked by
the invasion]{.underline}. The size, speed, and sweep of existing
sanctions---supported not only by the United States but also by the
entire European Union and several Asian allies---are exceptional. It is
entirely possible that Putin was unreceptive to Western threats leading
up to the invasion because unified and damaging sanctions against Russia
have little historical precedence.

[Moreover, except for canceling the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from
Russia, Western economic [sanctions]{.mark}, including the freezing of
Russian central bank assets, have **[exempted]{.mark} sales of [fossil
fuels]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Crude petroleum, refined petroleum, and
petroleum gas constitute roughly 35 percent of Russian exports, while
all fuels and minerals make up 59 percent of exports. [Putin clearly
believed that his economy could easily weather the fallout from his war
and that Europe would not risk cutting off Russian gas and oil
supplies]{.underline}. [Perhaps **[threatening to hit Russia]{.mark}
[where it would really hurt]{.mark}**---by **[sanctioning]{.mark}
exports of [fossil fuels]{.mark}**---would have made an **[effective
deterrent]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But Europe\'s energy shortages at the
height of winter made an embargo politically impossible.

[[Despite]{.mark} their [failure]{.mark} in deterring the invasion,
[current]{.mark} [sanctions]{.mark} may **[serve future
deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}: Putin might, for example, [desist
from threatening Moldova, Finland, and Sweden]{.underline} (not members
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \[NATO\]) in his quest for a
grander Russian empire. As well, [[Beijing]{.mark} might [draw]{.mark} a
sobering [lesson]{.mark} from the worldwide condemnation of Russia and
[reconsider]{.mark} military [plans for]{.mark} eventual [unification
with Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline} [China is more integrated with the
world economy than Russia]{.underline}: Two-way Chinese trade was 36
percent of GDP in 2019 while two-way Russian trade, excluding oil and
gas exports, was 25 percent.\[1\] The prospect of Russia-style sanctions
on China would entail a drastic fall in living standards.

[[Ukraine's countermoves against Russia]{.mark}'s larger military [shows

weapons]{.mark}** and a determination to resist invasion by a larger

according to a [senior US State Department official.]{.underline}

"One of the things that [everyone is thinking about [when it comes to
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, and I think a [lesson learned from this
war, is that **[asymmetric works]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Jessica Lewis,
[assistant secretary of state for political-military
affairs,]{.underline} said Wednesday at a Center for International and
Strategic Studies event on US security assistance to Ukraine.

Lewis said [[Ukraine's use of]{.mark} US-provided Javelin anti-tank
systems and Stinger anti-aircraft weapons \-- considered
[asymmetric]{.mark}]{.underline} because they can help a smaller force
battle a stronger opponent \-- [[hold lessons]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the
defense of [Taiwan, which **China has threatened**]{.mark} **with
invasion**]{.underline}.

Pointing out that [US officials have long studied how **[Taiwan should
prepare for]{.mark} a potential [Chinese assault]{.mark}**]{.underline},
Lewis said defenders against a numerically more powerful invasion force
[require more than advanced weapons.]{.underline} She said it's
[important not to "over-compare]{.underline}" the situations in Ukraine
and Taiwan [but crucial to look for lessons learned]{.underline}.

"For a long time, [when it comes to Taiwan]{.underline}, we've been
looking at this question, you know[: What does an asymmetric defense and
preparing yourself look like]{.underline}?" she said. "It's [not just a
matter of whether you have a Stinger or a Javelin]{.underline}. What
we've seen from from the Ukrainians is you have a [population that was
trained, willing and able to fight]{.underline}."

[[Taiwan]{.mark}\'s [former defense chief]{.mark} has [said]{.mark} that
the self-ruled [island\'s military **urgently needs**]{.mark} **cheap
and [asymmetric weapons]{.mark}** if it has [to counter Beijing\'s
greater firepower]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Lee Hsi-min, a retired admiral and former chief of general staff of
Taiwan\'s armed forces]{.underline}, told Nikkei Asia in an exclusive
interview that **[[Taiwan]{.mark} is [facing]{.mark} an \"[existential
threat]{.mark}\" [posed by]{.mark} an increasingly [aggressive
China.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[The former defense chief said [Taiwan should **prioritize**]{.mark}
**[weapons]{.mark} that are [cost-effective]{.mark} and harder for
Beijing to destroy**]{.underline}, rather than procuring \"conventional
weapons such as fighter jets, tanks, and warships.\" He also [stressed
the importance of forcing civilian units, much like Ukraine\'s
Territorial Defense Force]{.underline}.

Citing the [U.S. Pacific Forces former commander]{.underline} Adm.
Philip Davidson\'s warning that the [[Chinese invasion]{.mark} of Taiwan
[could happen by 2027,]{.mark}]{.underline} Lee said \"**[[time
is]{.mark} so [urgent]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" for Taiwan. \"[Taiwan
doesn\'t have a sufficient **sense of urgency to prepare for a Chinese
attack**]{.underline},\" Lee told Nikkei Asia.

That said, Lee refused to \"speculate\" whether Washington would send
troops to Taiwan in the event of a conflict. \"I\'m not a fortuneteller.
[The answer is for Taiwan to integrate its security with U.S.
interests]{.underline} \-- and how to do so is a political, not
military, question \-- on issues such as freedom, justice, human
rights,\" he said, adding that Washington would come to the rescue if it
were in its national interest.

\"But [[Taiwan]{.mark} also **needs to [show the will to defend]{.mark}
itself**]{.underline},\" he said. However, on the subject of military
cooperation between Taipei and Washington, Lee said [Taiwan should focus
on close-range defense and the U.S. on long-range battles.]{.underline}

[In countering China, Lee believes Taiwan [should embrace]{.mark} the
\"[overall defense concept]{.mark}]{.underline},\" commonly known as
\"**[porcupine\" asymmetric defense]{.underline}**. \"Given the
discrepancies in defense resources across the strait, we have no way of
competing against the People\'s Liberation Army in conventional
capabilities,\" the former defense chief said.

He said rather than raising the defense budget, which only leads to an
arms race, **[[Taiwan should adopt \"deterrence by
denial]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}**

\"[We don\'t have deterrence by alliances]{.underline}, because Taiwan
doesn\'t have formal military pacts with other countries or nuclear
deterrence. [But **deterrence by denial can deter a Chinese invasion**
by raising the cost for China **[via asymmetric
defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even if they were willing to pay the
price, the [strategy **[adds uncertainty to]{.mark} whether they could
[take over Taiwan]{.mark}**,]{.underline}\" Lee told the news outlet.

He also wants [[Taiwan]{.mark} to [copy Ukraine in]{.mark} its
**[creation of the Territorial Defense Force]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
\"The Territorial Defense Force is not about guerrilla warfare. It is to
tell the PRC: \'Even if you can defeat our air force and our navy, and
[even if you successfully land on Taiwanese territory]{.underline}, you
still [[cannot occupy]{.mark} and control [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Smart Grids

### 2NC -- Smart Grids

#### Smart grids [prevent]{.underline} large scale blackouts -- preventative technology and real time blackout isolation solve for [all]{.underline} impacts 

**Volodarsky 21** \[Now., 2-11-2021, \"The Smart Grid, A Smart
Investment,\" Risk Management and Decision Processes Center,
https://riskcenter.wharton.upenn.edu/lab-notes/smartgrid/, smarx, HHW\]

[How does [one tree create]{.mark} a [dip in America's GDP]{.mark}? It
[falls on]{.mark} a [transmission line]{.mark}, [caus]{.mark}ing a
**[2-day blackout]{.mark} for 50 million people**]{.underline}. The
[[2003]{.mark} East Coast [Blackout cost America]{.mark} approximately
[\$6.4 billion]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [that was 17 years
ago]{.underline}---[one would [assume]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} would have
[improved]{.mark} its electrical [grid by now]{.mark}.]{.underline}

According to data provided by the Department of Energy, **[that is [not
the case]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The number of major [[outages]{.mark}
in the US nearly [tripled]{.mark} from 2003 to 2018]{.underline}.
America has the highest number of outage minutes of any developed
nation, totaling around 6 hours annually. [US [outages]{.mark} are
getting [longer too]{.mark}. The average US power outage is 120 minutes
and increasing]{.underline}, while the average outage of other developed
nations is approximately 20 minutes and decreasing. This is unsurprising
considering [70% of American transmission lines and transformers are 25
years old, and the average age of US power plants is 36 years
old.]{.underline}

[Our [current system]{.mark} **doesn't just need an update, it [needs a
reconstruction]{.mark}**. **The [US should transition]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} its [current]{.mark} electrical [system to the smart
grid]{.mark}**,]{.underline} a network that utilizes [digital
communication technology to react to changes in electricity
usage]{.underline}, in order to [**[mitigate]{.mark} the
[risks]{.mark}** [associated with]{.mark} power [outages as well as
climate change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[How is a smart grid better than the current system?]{.underline}

[Blackouts occur when electricity demand exceeds supply, or equipment in
the system malfunctions]{.underline}. The current US grid delivers
electricity from the power plant through transmission lines,
substations, and transformers to homes and businesses. [This system puts
the burden on utility companies to match supply of electricity perfectly
with demand]{.underline}, since electricity generated at power stations
is not stored. If equipment fails, consumers notify the utility company
and then a utility worker must physically reroute the flow of
electricity. [By the time the electricity is rerouted, the power failure
could have escalated into a blackout, as other lines might not have
enough spare capacity to accommodate the extra current.]{.underline}

[[Smart grids integrate digital technology]{.mark} such as smart meters
[throughout the]{.mark} energy [system]{.mark}]{.underline} that feed
real-time data back to utility companies, allowing for [accurate
predictions of supply and demand. Instead of relying on consumers to
notify utilities of power failures]{.underline}, expected failures are
located by smart sensors enabling quicker responses to disruption. More
than just a data-aggregation vehicle, the [smart grid also automatically
reroutes electricity flow and prevents the overheating of transmission
lines. [When]{.mark} a [disruption occurs]{.mark}, the [smart grid
isolates]{.mark} the outage, **[containing]{.mark} it [before it
becomes]{.mark} a [large-scale]{.mark} blackout.**]{.underline}

**[Why is transitioning to a smart grid important?]{.underline}**

[[Power outages carry]{.mark} a myriad of [risks]{.mark}. **There are
[economic risks]{.mark}**, with the inflation-adjusted cost to the US of
only weather-related outages estimated at **\$25-\$70 billion
annually**]{.underline}. There are also health and public safety risks.
[Power outages cause [food spoilage and water
contamination]{.mark}]{.underline}, as electricity-powered machinery
such as refrigeration units and water pumps fail. [Although most
hospitals have emergency generators, most of these units provide back-up
power for only about 8 hours]{.underline}. The power outages that last
longer put [[hospital functionality at risk]{.mark},]{.underline} as
computer networks and medical devices are reliant on electricity. Power
outages also increase mortality risk. A [study on mortality during the
2003 blackout showed that mortality increased in New York City by 122%
for accidental deaths]{.underline} and 25% for nonaccidental
(disease-related) deaths, [culminating in about 90 excess
deaths]{.underline}.

[[Sticking to]{.mark} the [status-quo]{.mark} will only
[increase]{.mark} the aforementioned [risks]{.mark}, as [extreme
weather]{.mark} is [expected to increase]{.mark} with climate
change]{.underline}. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists,
[our current grid will **require new technologies** to withstand these
more severe conditions.]{.underline} Not only will transitioning to a
[[smart grid]{.mark} [make]{.mark} our [system more resilient]{.mark}
against extreme weather]{.underline}, but it will [[also help]{.mark}
the US [mitigate]{.mark} the [risk of climate
change]{.mark}.]{.underline} The IBM white paper reports smart grid
adoption would cause a 12% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030. The study
mentions 9 levers enabled by the smart grid, such as greater integration
of renewable energy, which contribute to that reduction.

The [obligations created under the BWC are **broad, prophylactic, and
forward-looking**.]{.underline}

B. The Biological Weapons Act Of 1989

Congress gave the BWC domestic effect in 1989 when it passed the
Biological Weapons Act.52 The statute had two principal purposes: (1)
"to implement the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, an international
agreement unanimously ratified by the United States Senate in 1974 and
signed by more than 100 other nations, including the Soviet Union"; and
(2) to "protect the United States against the threat of biological
terrorism."53 To further the latter purpose, [the law imposed criminal
sanctions for developing bioweapons]{.underline},54 [allowed the
government to seize bioweapons]{.underline},55 [and provided a cause of
action for the U.S. to seek injunctions against
violators.]{.underline}56 C. Security Council Resolution 1540 In 2004,
the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1540 to strengthen
international efforts to combat the development of biological weapons.57
As the Security Council acted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the
United Nations[, this **Resolution is binding international
law**.]{.underline} Resolution 1540 strengthened several points in the
BWC by providing: (1) an explicit focus on nonstate actors; (2)
applicability to states not parties to the BWC; (3) more specific
measures states must take to prevent bioterrorism, including measures
regarding security, physical protection, and border and export controls;
and (4) very limited verification and enforcement.58 [**The Security
Council** decided]{.underline}, that [all States, in accordance with
their national procedures, shall adopt and enforce appropriate effective
laws which prohibit any non-State actor to manufacture, acquire,
possess, develop, transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons and their means of delivery, in particular for
terrorist purposes, as well as attempts to engage in any of the
foregoing activities, participate in them as an accomplice, assist or
finance them.]{.underline}59 In my estimate, the U.S. is currently in
compliance with this Resolution with respect to biological weapons
because it adopted the Biological Weapons Act.60 [This]{.underline}
statute "prohibited" biological weapon-related activities, [**imposed
harsh criminal penalties for violations**, and]{.underline} specifically
[focused on terrorism]{.underline}.61 However, the story is not the same
for the BWC. In addition to mandating that states "prohibit" bioweapons
and related activities like Resolution 1540 does, [the BWC also mandates
**that states "take any necessary measures . . . to prevent**" bioweapon
**development and use**.]{.underline}62

III\. THE UNITED STATES IS VIOLATING INTERNATIONAL LAW

The United States is in violation of the BWC because of its failure to
meaningfully regulate synthetic biology.63 First, I will demonstrate
that the broad definition of biological weapons in the Convention
encompasses the nefarious applications of synthetic biology. Next, I
will argue [that Article IV mandates that states regulate non-state
actors.]{.underline} Finally, I will endeavor to show that the U.S. is
violating the BWC because it is not taking "necessary measures" to
"prevent" synthetic biology from being used to create biological
weapons. According to the Third Restatement of Foreign Relations Law, a
treaty is to be interpreted "in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in light
of its object and purpose."64 In Medellin v. Texas, the Supreme Court
provided that "\[t\]he interpretation of a treaty, like the
interpretation of a statute, begins with its text."65 Synthetic Biology
is Encompassed [The]{.underline} broad [language of the BWC
**encompasses synthetic biology** used for nefarious
purposes.]{.underline} Article I defines biological weapons as
"microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin
or method of production, of types and in quantities that have no
justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes .
. ."66 [DNA is surely a "biological agent\[\]," and the phrase,
"whatever their origin or method of production" ensures that man-made
DNA is no exception.]{.underline}67 [Applications]{.underline} of
synthetic biology justified by prosocial purposes [are **clearly not
forbidden**,]{.underline} while malevolent applications are.68 The BWC
purposefully used spacious language to encompass all biological entities
that could be weaponized.69 [Article VI]{.underline}, which establishes
five-year reviews to "[take into account any new scientific and
technological developments relevant to the Convention," ensures that
that the meaning of a biological weapon was not fixed at the time of the
Convention.]{.underline}70 [The definition was meant to evolve to
encompass future threats.]{.underline} Professor Sutton notes that at
the time of the Convention, the parties understood they were in the
middle of a biotechnology revolution, and that "there was a clear need
to meet every five years to assess any new technologies that were
relevant to the treaty."71 Indeed, the Final Report of the Experts at
the BWC Seventh Review Conference in [2014 explicitly determined that
synthetic biology was encompassed by the Article I
definition.]{.underline}72 In doing so, the Seventh Review Conference
reaffirmed that "Article I applies to all scientific and technological
developments in the life sciences and in other fields of science
relevant to the Convention."7 [Mandatory Duty and Non-State Actors
Article IV extends to states a mandatory duty to regulate non-state
actors to prevent bioweapon development.]{.underline} Article IV
provides that: Each State Party to this Convention shall, in accordance
with its constitutional processes, take any necessary measures to
prohibit and prevent the development, production, stockpiling,
acquisition or retention of the agents, toxins, weapons, equipment and
means of delivery specified in Article I of the Convention, within the
territory of such State, under its jurisdiction or under its control
anywhere.74 [First, the command "shall" clearly imposes a mandatory
duty. Second, the "territory, jurisdiction, or control" language applies
this duty to non-state actors. This language was not in the Geneva
protocol, which explicitly only applied to states.]{.underline}75 In
addition, Article I already prohibits states from developing bioweapons,
so if this phrase is to have any meaning, it must refer to non-state
actors.76 C. Necessary Measures to Prevent We now move to the phrase
"take any necessary measures to prohibit and prevent."77 While this is
undoubtedly forceful language, it is also quite general. However, a
plain reading suggests that it compels energetic state action to prevent
the development of bioweapons within its jurisdiction. Such a reading is
bolstered by the BWC's purpose. The BWC's preamble expressly states that
its purpose is "to exclude completely the possibility of bacteriological
(biological) agents and toxins being used as weapons" through "effective
measures," "\[c\]onvinced that such use would be repugnant to the
conscience of mankind and that no effort should be spared to minimise
this risk."[78 Accordingly, states must take their obligation under the
**BWC quite seriously**]{.underline}.79 To be clear, I am not suggesting
that the BWC mandates state parties to take every conceivable measure to
prevent bioweapon development; that would be wasteful and impossible.
This provision is more straightforwardly read as requiring states to
take reasonable, necessary measures. The crux of my argument is that the
United States is in violation of the BWC because it is failing to take
necessary measures to prevent synthetic biology from being
weaponized**[. The United States]{.underline}** currently [**employs**
two main **measures** toward compliance with the BWC. First, the
Biological Weapons Act **criminalizes bioweapon activities**, which
include the malicious manipulation of synthetic biology. 80 Second, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of
Agriculture (USDA) screen biological product orders for "select agents"
that pose severe threats.]{.underline} 81 However, this screening does
not extend to synthetic DNA orders. These measures are deeply
insufficient to meet the treaty's obligations given the rapid
democratization of synthetic biology and the threats it poses.

[**Biological weapons are considered the most dangerous** of all known
**weapons of mass destruction**. They are used to deliberately cause
epidemics among humans; destroy the environmental components, including
water, air, and soil; and target crops and livestock.]{.underline}
Examples of diseases used in biological warfare include anthrax,
smallpox, plague, cholera, and avian flu. [In addition to the
catastrophic effects of biological warfare on the biodiversity and the
environment]{.underline}, [their danger lies in their low cost and
**rapid spread**, as well as their easy preparation, transport, and
use.]{.underline} Unlike nuclear and chemical bombs[, biological bombs
are without odor or color and therefore cannot be detected.
Additionally, **bioweapons are dangerous because of their effects on
untargeted organisms** in a military attack, and the clinical symptoms
they create may be difficult to distinguish from normal
diseases.]{.underline} [Bioweapon pathogens remain in nature for several
years and are able to survive in harsh environmental conditions.
Bioweapons spread germs that contaminate air, food, water, and the
environment, causing epidemiological diseases for different living
organisms.]{.underline} Air: [A wide variety of germs can contaminate
air and are used in biological warfare]{.underline}. Fungi are the most
common, and they travel by air over long distances to infect healthy
plants. Food: [Food contamination is also one of the most powerful
methods used to carry out biological warfare attacks. Disease is
transmitted either directly to humans through contaminated food or drink
or indirectly by hosts.]{.underline} Water: [Water can spread a number
of lethal infectious agents as well. For example, one gram of
Clostridium tetani poison is able to **kill eight million people within
six hours**]{.underline}. Diseases are one of the main drivers of
extinction in endangered species; therefore, disease control is
fundamental to preserve biodiversity. [Despite the presence of vaccines
and drugs for most bioweapons, they may not be available in adequate
quantities to cope with an epidemiological disease outbreak. Biological
attacks pose a threat to naturally rare wild plants and animals and to
species whose natural habitats have been degraded by human activities.
Furthermore, diseases that humans, domestic animals, and domestic plants
have been able to develop immunity to can be fatal in wild animals and
plants. **Bioweapons** are not only having **direct effects** on the
genetic biodiversity of indigenous species but also are having direct
and indirect catastrophic effects on vital plant and animal
communities]{.underline}. Conservation of livestock breeds is essential
to maintaining genetic diversity, which in turn is vital to increasing
the ability of living organisms to adapt to environmental changes. The
danger of bioweapons regarding animal biodiversity is summarized in
three main points: 1. The direct impact of diseases on wild species Some
d[eadly diseases in humans or domestic animals can infect wild
animals.]{.underline} For instance, an epidemic destructive impact on
endangered species is reflected in the effects of Canine distemper, a
natural viral disease that infects wild dogs and wild animals belonging
to the same group. Canine distemper was also developed in bioweapon
laboratories. Over the past decade[, the spread of this disease has
resulted in habitat loss and in the extinction of a large number of wild
species in North America]{.underline}. Additionally, it led to the
elimination of about one-third of the lion population in Tanzania and
had serious impacts on the endangered leopard population. 2. Invasive
species The history of rinderpest in Africa provides a model for
predicting the potential effects of lethal diseases on wild species and
livestock. In 1887, European colonial armies introduced the rinderpest
virus to Africa through imported cattle, which led to a rinderpest
outbreak among domestic cattle breeds and wild species, killing an
estimated 90--95% of African cattle and buffaloes within three years. To
control the epidemic, African herds and buffaloes have been destroyed in
most parts of Africa. Despite efforts to combat rinderpest over the past
century, the disease is still strong, and its outbreak in the region
occurs frequently. 3. Elimination of animal species, hosts, and vectors
Threatened species may be destroyed in areas that have been subjected to
biological attacks with the aim of eradicating the disease. For example,
in the United States, programs to control brucellosis in livestock have
resulted in killing large numbers of wild animals, including the Bison
and the white tailed deer. Microbes can be used in crop destruction. For
instance, "Rice blast" is a disease affecting rice and therefore leads
to crop destruction and genetic changes in the plant. [The discussion
about controlling destructive **bioweapons** is growing, as they **pose
a vast danger to both humanity and the environment** alike. Any failure
to prevent biological attacks can lead to the deterioration of genetic
diversity in animals and plants, the extinction of endangered species,
and the destruction of human livelihoods and traditional
cultures]{.underline}. Biotechnology has increased the economical value
of genetic diversity of living organisms; hence, it has increased the
risk of eliminating genetic diversity through the use of GMO bioweapons.
[Most of all, the environment will be the silent victim of this
war]{.underline}. It is not easy to put an end to the biological arms
race, so [global efforts must be consolidated to combat these threats.
Countries must strengthen their ability to detect early
attacks.]{.underline} Biologists and economists need to communicate with
decision makers to convince them of the importance of developing defense
systems to face bioweapons and limit their environmental and
socioeconomical effects. Certainly[, it is **necessary** to raise
awareness regarding the dangers of biological warfare.]{.underline}
[Interdisciplinary and international efforts are required to increase
the surveillance, monitoring, and identification of pathogens and to
better understand the dynamics of disease transmission within human,
plant, and animal populations. This will greatly enhance our ability to
combat the effects of bioweapons and emerging diseases on
biodiversit]{.underline}y.

These planks could both be used, this one only because it is probably
generic enough to encompass the entire aff, or the top one only if
looking to only solve for BCIs. The planks aren't mutually exclusive, I
just have them in different spots

[The Russian Federation and China reaffirm their conviction that the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and
Stockpiling of]{.underline} Bacteriological ([Biological]{.underline})
and Toxin [Weapons and on their Destruction (BWC)]{.underline} is
essential as a pillar of the international peace and security, and their
determination to safeguard the authority and effectiveness of the
Convention. Today, as in 1975, its objective remains relevant: to rule
completely out the possibility of biological agents being used as
weapons. [The Russian Federation and China reiterate the need that **the
BWC should be fully complied with and further
strengthened**,]{.underline} including through its institutionalization
and the adoption of a legally binding protocol to the Convention with
effective verification mechanism, as well as through regular
consultations and cooperation in resolving any issues related to the
implementation of the Convention. [The **Russian** Federation **and
China emphasize** that the BWC functions, including in what concerns the
United Nations Security Council, should not be duplicated by other
mechanisms.]{.underline} With a view to shaping a BWC mechanism of
investigation of the alleged biological weapons incidents, [**they call
on the BWC States Parties to develop operating standards** for the
mechanism, together with technical guidelines and
procedures.]{.underline} The Russian Federation and China note with
concern that over the past two decades the BWC States Parties, despite
the wishes of the overwhelming majority, have failed to reach an
agreement on resuming the multilateral negotiations on the Protocol to
the Convention, suspended in 2001 when the United States unilaterally
withdrew from this process despite the fact that the consensus was
almost reached. Consequently, and also in the light of rapid advances in
the field of science and technology with dual-use capabilities, the risk
of biological agents being used as weapons has increased. In this
context they emphasize that the United States' and its allies' overseas
military biological activities (over 200 US biological laboratories are
deployed outside its national territory, which function in opaque and
non-transparent manner) cause serious concerns and questions among the
international community over its compliance with the BWC. The two sides
share the view that such activities pose serious risks for the national
security of the Russian Federation and China, and are detrimental to the
security of relevant regions. The Russian Federation and China further
note that the United States' and its allies' military biological
activities on their national territory also cause serious compliance
concerns. Given the fact that the United States and its allies do not
provide any meaningful information on those military biological
activities that could allay concerns of the international community, the
Russian Federation and China urge the United States and its allies to
act in an open, transparent and responsible manner, by informing
properly on its military biological activities carried out overseas and
on their national territory, and supporting the resumption of
negotiations on a legally binding protocol to the BWC with effective
verification mechanism, so as to ensure their compliance with the BWC.
In this context the [Russian]{.underline} Federation [and China note the
importance of improved confidence-building measures under the
Convention, inter alia, by including information on the overseas
military biological activities by the BWC States Parties in the
reporting form. The two sides believe that such declaration will be
conducive to filling in the blank spots and **fostering confidence among
States Parties**.]{.underline} The [Russian]{.underline} Federation and
[China also call upon the BWC States Parties to continue joint efforts
**towards strengthening the Convention** on a secure, legally binding
basis. They welcome relevant initiatives. At the same time, they support
ancillary measures to **improve the current implementation of the
Convention**.]{.underline} The BWC institutional framework would be
strengthened with the proposed mobile biomedical teams to render
assistance in cases of biological weapons use, investigate such cases
and help combat epidemics of various origins. This proposal represents a
new approach to the improved BWC implementation at the international
level, combining the principles of collective security and cooperation
for peaceful purposes. [The Russian Federation and China stress that the
rapid development of **science and technology in BWC-related areas call
for greater attention of the BWC States Parties**. There is a need to
raise awareness of the risks associated with dual-use research and,
simultaneously, **promote the full use of the latest advances in
biotechnology for peaceful purposes**. In this context, the Russian
Federation and China support the idea to establish a BWC scientific
advisory committee to analyse scientific and technological advances
relevant to the Convention and advise its States Parties
accordingly.]{.underline} At the BWC Ninth Review Conference, [the
Russian Federation and China are prepared to consider any proposals
capable of strengthening the Convention and improving its implementation
in a non-discriminatory manner.]{.underline} They call upon all BWC
States Parties to adopt a constructive approach to ensure that the
decisions taken serve strengthening the BWC regime.

\"The Biological Weapons Convention protocol should be revisited,\"
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
https://thebulletin.org/2019/11/the-biological-weapons-convention-protocol-should-be-revisited/\]//MaizeDS

After its enactment in 1975, one criticism of the major international
treaty banning biological weapons, the Biological Weapons Convention,
was that it had no provisions to monitor whether countries were
complying with it. Being, as it was, the middle of the Cold War, it was
unlikely that the Soviet Union would allow international inspectors to
visit its biodefense facilities. But [as representatives from dozens of
countries prepare to discuss the convention in Geneva this December, it
would be worth their while to revisit a long-abandoned protocol that
would address flaws in a treaty that some have even derided as a
gentleman's agreement.]{.underline} After the Soviet Union collapsed,
countries sought to address this perceived weakness in the convention by
pushing measures to enforce its terms by enacting a so-called protocol
to the convention that provided procedures for randomly selected site
visits and a rapid means to investigate weapons development,
stockpiling, and use. But supporters of the proposal had their hopes
dashed in 2001 when the United States pulled out of a UN ad hoc group
tasked with drafting the protocol, meaning the proposed provisions never
were enacted into international law. US officials were concerned that
biological weapons development couldn't be verified. Undeterred,
protocol supporters held out hopes that under President Barack Obama the
United States would change course. But Obama officials also refused to
support the protocol--for the same reasons the previous Bush
administration had cited in 2001: The legally binding additions to the
convention would not achieve meaningful verification or greater
security. This claim by both US presidential administrations about
inability to verify misses the important point that the main goal of the
protocol was transparency, not verification. [But recent events serve to
underscore that a protocol to the convention to address the treaty's
shortcomings is an idea that should be revisited. Unfounded Russian
allegations about biological weapons development in former Soviet
countries are threatening the effectiveness of the convention. This
concern along with strong arguments for the high importance of
transparency in international treaties calls for revisiting the
protocol, which had provisions for both transparency and for dealing
with allegations like Russia's.]{.underline} The Russian allegations.
Moscow made waves ahead of a meeting of countries in the convention in
late 2018 when it alleged, without evidence, that former Soviet states
harbor biological weapons laboratories. To paraphrase biosecurity
researcher Filippa Lentzos: [The unfounded allegations about biological
weapons development carried with them dangerous consequences.
Accusations like these could help sow distrust and political dissent
that could even lead to a military response. They could also erode the
convention by making countries more likely to develop their own
biological weapons. A coalition of nongovernmental groups that work on
issues related to the convention echoed these concerns in a joint
statement in]{.underline} December, [2018. These are reasons enough to
revisit the protocol.]{.underline} The main focus of Russia's
allegations was the biosafety-level-three laboratory built in the
country of Georgia to research pathogens that cause serious human
disease. Biosafety-level-three laboratories have many features designed
to protect laboratory workers from infection and to reduce the
probability of a release of pathogens into the surrounding community. In
an attempt to dispel the Russian allegations, a group of international
experts visited the Georgia facility. They concluded that it
demonstrated significant transparency, and they saw nothing that would
not be expected in a legitimate facility. [It is surprising that Russia
would take such a disruptive position and put the convention at risk.
The Soviet Union was one of three countries leading support for the
convention (depository states) and Russia had been active in and
supportive of the protocol negotiations. But under President Vladimir
Putin, the country's position has changed]{.underline}; It may now be
trying to undermine the convention. Two of the abandoned protocol's
major provisions were randomly selected transparency visits and
investigations of alleged breaches. [Had the protocol been enacted,
these measures would have provided means to either deter or dispel
unfounded accusations. During the intense debate 20 years ago over the
protocol, it seems that no one argued, at least loudly,]{.underline} for
its value as a tool to address allegations like Russia's that undermine
the convention's effectiveness. The argument for the high importance of
transparency lays the foundation for revisiting the protocol. In the
United States, the pharmaceutical industry was adamantly against visits
to their facilities, some of which manufactured antibiotics using
proprietary strains of bacteria. Some in the industry felt that stealing
a microbe was akin to stealing a whole factory's operation. There were
also concerns that visitors would demand to see rooms with proprietary
manufacturing processes or that employees would inadvertently give out
proprietary information. Furthermore, the industry was concerned about
damage to its good-will from misunderstandings about the purpose of
random transparency visits or from false accusations of bioweapons
development. But as experience with the Chemical Weapons Convention
shows, the concepts of managed access have eased some of industry's
concerns. There were US government concerns as well. Some officials
argued that convention-sanctioned international teams visiting
biodefense facilities posed a risk to classified information and
materials, especially if the delegations included foreign intelligence
agents. But the United States has already agreed to intrusive
inspections under managed access for at least three other international
treaties. John Bolton, appointed early in the George W. Bush
administration as undersecretary of state for arms control, pulled the
United States from the protocol and pressured the UN ad hoc group to
abandon it as well. Even without this overt pressure, supporters of the
protocol would have been hard-pressed to enact it without US support.
The United States withdrew at a very late stage; the ad hoc group's
chairman's text was completed and was ready to be submitted to the
United Nations for potential approval. When Obama was elected in 2008,
there was hope among protocol supporters that it would finally be
enacted, especially since its sister treaty, the Chemical Weapons
Convention, was enacted in 1997. This was a false hope. In 2009, Under
Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher told a meeting of convention members
that the Obama administration would not seek enactment of the protocol.
The administration had "determined that a legally binding protocol would
not achieve meaningful verification or greater security. It is
extraordinarily difficult to verify compliance." Subsequently, US
Ambassador Laura Kennedy and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made
almost identical arguments about the inability to verify. The US
government under Obama had become ensnared in the verification trap.
Even though discovery of hidden offensive biological weapons activities
is difficult, other aspects of compliance with the convention are
verifiable. Unfortunately, the word "verification" leads people into
drawing false parallels to nuclear arms control where weapons
development is often possible to verify. Although it actually focused on
transparency, the 2001 protocol was viewed by some as a verification
mechanism, a misguided view that helped lead to its collapse. The word
"verification" does not appear even once in the draft of the protocol
and the word "transparency" appears perhaps a hundred times. The
protocol collapsed in part due to this misunderstanding (or
misrepresentation). As the Bioweapons Monitor eloquently argued in 2011,
"Compliance with the (bioweapons) prohibition is about more than
verifying the absence of biological weapons. Perhaps more importantly,
it is also about verifying the peaceful nature of activities that could
contribute to biological weapons development efforts." The Monitor
argued that political scientists and diplomats have consistently
stressed that multilateral arms control regimes rely on transparency to
be effective. Transparency serves to reassure countries that others are
not conducting illicit work. "Excessive secrecy of activities in the
biological field, particularly if carried out in military facilities, is
likely to lead to misinterpretation and suspicion, and may result in a
new biological arms race." [A revised protocol could help counter
destabilizing efforts like those of Russia]{.underline}, whose unfounded
allegations threatened to undermine confidence in the convention. [By
dramatically increasing transparency around biological work, a new
protocol could bolster the broader convention and help stave off the
potential for a biological weapons arms race.]{.underline}

against bioweapons,\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
https://thebulletin.org/2022/03/dont-let-finger-pointing-doom-this-key-treaty-against-bioweapons/\]//MaizeDS

When the US State Department accused Russia of maintaining a biological
weapons program last year, officials were putting concerns they had been
harboring for years squarely on the record. Meanwhile Russia and China
have been accusing US partnerships in Ukraine, other former Soviet
republics, and elsewhere of being fronts for nefarious biological
activities or bioweapons programs. For some 50 years, the Biological
Weapons Convention has been the bulwark stopping countries from
including these arms in arsenals and war plans, but some experts warn
there is a new interest in the weapons or even a budding biological arms
race.

[Few doubt that the Biological Weapons Convention is languishing at a
critical time. Major world powers are accusing each other of maintaining
bioweapons programs and the fast pace of the global scientific
enterprise is making it harder for countries to find balance between
technological advances and risky biological research. Meanwhile, efforts
to strengthen the convention have been in a holding pattern for over 20
years since the United States scuttled negotiations meant to give the
treaty a means of verifying compliance. It's now generally very hard to
get anything done at treaty meetings.]{.underline}

[The world needs a stronger Biological Weapons Convention more than
ever]{.underline}, and this summer, when states meet to review the
treaty, the prospects for making progress on issues like compliance,
transparency, cooperation and verification are better than they have
been for over a decade, if acrimony over bioweapons claims, for
starters, doesn't get in the way.

Bioweapons claims. [Allegations of biological weapons programs are not a
new issue, but in the last year more claims have been made public. Some
are disinformation; others are assessments that cannot be easily
validated with publicly available data.]{.underline}

The United States has been concerned about biological weapons for years,
but the extent to which it announces these concerns publicly varies from
year to year. Back in 2001, in the wake of 9/11, the United States
identified Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya, Syria and Sudan as concerns.
Last year, in its annual arms control compliance report China, North
Korea, Iran, and Russia were named as problem states. For Iran, the
concerns were couched in terms of dual use activities, i.e. research
that could be used for peaceful or offensive purposes. For China, the
United States has been concerned with the country's biotechnology
infrastructure, activities with dual-use applications, and pursuit of
scientific cooperation with so-called "countries of concern," but the US
government has stopped short of claiming that China is non-compliant
with the convention.

But in 2021, the State Department made a somewhat startling shift.

It not only assessed North Korea as having an offensive biological
weapons program, which the department had done before, but also accused
Russia of the same.

The report unambiguously declared that Russia maintains an offensive
biological warfare program and is in violation of the convention. While
the State Department provided no new evidence to explain the shift in
language from the 2020 report, which said the United States was unable
to conclude Russia has fulfilled its obligations under the convention
and listed "concerns about Russian activities," another issue presaged
the change in the report's tenor. In August 2020, the department added
three key military biological facilities in Russia to its list of
entities subject to trade restrictions because the US government
believes they pose security risks. The 2021 report made clear that the
United States believes these same three institutes are Russian Ministry
of Defense facilities associated with the biological warfare program.
The compliance report's allegations are part of a larger US strategy to
push back on Russia's increasingly obstructionist diplomatic behavior in
arms control talks and its aggressive disinformation campaign around
biological weapons. Last November, US National Security Advisor Jake
Sullivan, in a White House statement, noted "some nations still possess
biological weapons programs" and that others seek to acquire them. The
US under-secretary for arms control and international security,
Ambassador Bonnie Jenkins, echoed these claims a few days later at a
Biological Weapons Convention meeting where she referred to countries
that possess "sophisticated, well-established biological weapons
programs."

But the US claims aren't occurring in a vacuum.

Like Russia, China has often made claims about US biological weapons
programs, most notably a repeated false assertion that the United States
used bioweapons in the 1950s Korean war. More recently, Chinese
officials have leveled the baseless claim that Fort Detrick, once the
heart of the former US offensive weapons program, is the source of the
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

The new twist is that Russia and China are now making these sorts of
claims about US biological weapons programs in unison.

In October, as a UN meeting got underway, the two governments, for the
first time, issued a joint statement that expressed "serious concerns"
about United States and its allies' overseas military biological
activities, including the claim that they operated 200 "opaque and
non-transparent" biological laboratories outside US territory and that
activities at these laboratories pose "serious risks" to Russian and
Chinese national security.

Russia and China followed this statement in November with individual
claims in the form of official Biological Weapons Convention statements.

Russia, which has been accusing the United States of establishing a
chain of biological weapons labs on Russia's borders for years, claimed
the United States and its NATO allies had significantly expanded
military biomedical activities in countries near Russia. And China
stated that US "bio-military activities" outside its territory had
caused serious concerns about whether the United States was complying
with the Biological Weapons Convention.

The United States characterized these claims as "truly appalling
distortions of fact." Chris Park, a State Department official who is
part of the US delegation to the convention, called the accusations
"pure disinformation, plain and simple." The hundreds of laboratories
Russia and China accuse of suspicious activity are not American
facilities, he explained. While the US Department of Defense's
Cooperative Threat Reduction Program helped support the labs, they are
public and animal health facilities that are owned and operated by the
countries they are located in.

In advance of the Beijing Olympics in February, Chinese President Xi
Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin released an extensive joint
statement with a vision of a "new era" of international relations that
replaced the American-led order. The "Beijing manifesto" as The
Washington Post characterized it, also covered biological security. The
pair re-iterated claims from the preceding months that "domestic and
foreign bioweapons activities by the United States and its allies raise
serious concerns and questions for the international community regarding
their compliance with the \[Biological Weapons Convention\]." They
called on the United States and its allies "to act in an open,
transparent, and responsible manner by properly reporting on their
military biological activities conducted overseas and on their national
territory." And they also pressed for renewed negotiations on a legally
binding agreement to the Biological Weapons Convention that would create
a verification mechanism. Allegations, so what? Trading allegations
about biological weapons is nothing new for the United States, Russia,
and China. While the increase in biological barbs these three states
throw at each other is concerning, it does not necessarily mean the
ninth review conference of the Biological Weapons Convention, scheduled
for August, is doomed to become a shouting match. Past allegations have
soured the tone, but not prevented meaningful work at these events.

One ray of hope is that each of the three countries has articulated
plans that address issues of compliance, transparency and
accountability. Each is different, but there is common ground to craft a
workable compromise solution if the US, China, Russia and others are
determined to make progress. The most significant reason for hope is a
change in the US approach to making the convention more robust.

Last fall, Sullivan, the US National Security Advisor, said the United
States is "determined to strengthen and revitalize the \[convention\]."
Jenkins, the US ambassador, followed by outlining a two-track approach.
Track one sees the upcoming meeting taking near-term, concrete action on
a set of proposals that have been discussed at convention meetings over
the past few years, such as creating a mechanism to review scientific
advances and establishing a voluntary fund for technical cooperation.

A second track of activity would address harder issues, particularly
that of improving ways of demonstrating and assuring compliance with the
treaty. Only about half of the states in the Biological Weapons
Convention regularly submit confidence building measures, reports that
serve as one of the main means of assuring others of compliance. They're
not a mandatory, legal requirement.

The new tracks proposed by Jenkins represent a shift in the US position.
Although the US proposal is for working groups to address future
compliance mechanisms, i.e., meetings about the issues rather than a
proposal, what gives the US second track greater potential substance is
the similar approaches proposed by Russia and China's statements in
2021.

Both Russia and China want to return to negotiations on the verification
protocol abandoned in 2001, but both are aware the protocol of 2001 is
not suitable for the future. Beyond significant changes in science and
technology, the threat and risk environments around biological weapons
are different in 2022 to those of 2001. The three countries have
different visions, but share the idea of having specialised working
groups explore how to strengthen and revitalize the treaty.

Reaching agreement on anything in the Biological Weapons Convention
these days is extremely hard. In the last three years running, countries
have not even been able to agree any substantive outcome at technically
focused, expert meetings. The procedural reports from these gatherings
simply note "no consensus could be reached"---an exceptionally poor show
for meetings aiming merely to "promote common understanding."

What chance does a new approach have of success? The United States,
unlike Russia and China, has many allies, and much will depend on them
coming on-board. If they do, and the United States, Russia and China
recognize the commonalities in their approaches, and they work with
other countries, it might be possible to break the status quo of a
moribund work program.

Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) At A Glance,\" Arms Control
Association, https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/bwc\]//MaizeDS

[The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) is a **legally binding treaty**
that outlaws biological arms.]{.underline} After being discussed and
negotiated in the United Nations\' disarmament forum starting in 1969,
the BWC opened for signature on April 10, 1972, and entered into force
on March 26, 1975. [It currently has 183 states-parties, including
Palestine, and four signatories (Egypt, Haiti, Somalia, Syria, and
Tanzania).]{.underline} Ten states have neither signed nor ratified the
BWC (Chad, Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Israel, Kiribati, Micronesia,
Namibia, South Sudan and Tuvalu). [Terms of the Treaty The **BWC bans**:
The development, stockpiling, acquisition, retention, and production of:
Biological agents and toxins \"of types and in quantities that have no
justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes;\"
Weapons, equipment, and delivery vehicles \"designed to use such agents
or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.\"]{.underline} The
transfer of or assistance with acquiring the agents, toxins, weapons,
equipment, and delivery vehicles described above. The convention further
requires states-parties to destroy or divert to peaceful purposes the
\"agents, toxins, weapons, equipment, and means of delivery\" described
above within nine months of the convention\'s entry into force. The BWC
does not ban the use of biological and toxin weapons but reaffirms the
1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibits such use. It also does not ban
biodefense programs. Verification [The treaty regime **mandates that
states-parties consult with one another and cooperate**, bilaterally or
multilaterally, to solve compliance concerns]{.underline}. It also
allows states-parties to lodge a complaint with the UN Security Council
if they believe other member states are violating the convention. [The
Security Council can investigate complaints,]{.underline} but this power
has never been invoked. Security Council voting rules give China,
France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States veto power
over Security Council decisions, including those to conduct BWC
investigations. Membership and Duration The BWC is a multilateral treaty
of indefinite duration that is open to any country. Implementation The
convention has been flagrantly violated in the past. The Soviet Union, a
state-party and one of the convention\'s depositary states, maintained
an enormous offensive biological weapons program after ratifying the
BWC. Russia says that this program has been terminated, but questions
remain about what happened to elements of the Soviet program. Iraq
violated its commitments as a signatory state with its biological
weapons program, which was uncovered by the UN Special Commission on
Iraq after the Persian Gulf War. Iraq became a state-party after the
war. In November 2001, the United States publicly accused Iraq, as well
as member state North Korea, of breaching the convention\'s terms.
Washington also expressed concern about compliance by Iran and Libya,
which are also states-parties, and by Syria. The United States itself
raised concerns in 2001 about whether some of its activities, ostensibly
being conducted as part of its biodefense program, are permitted under
the BWC. In 2002, Washington added Cuba, also a state-party, to its list
of countries conducting activities that violate the convention.
According to the U.S. State Department 2021 Compliance Report, Russia
"maintains an offensive BW program and is in violation of its obligation
under Articles I and II of the BWC." The United States certified North
Korea in noncompliance with the BWC in 2021, and assessed it "does not
have sufficient information" to determine whether China is in compliance
with its obligation to eliminate its biological weapons stockpile under
the BWC. The 2021 U.S. Compliance Report also noted that Iran's
activities continue to "raise concerns regarding its compliance with
Article I of the BWC," and that it is "unable to differentiate some of
Iran's public health research and biodefense activities from those that
are prohibited under the BWC." Review Conferences States-parties have
convened a review conference about every five years to review and
improve upon the treaty\'s implementation. Second Review Conference In
an effort to enhance confidence and promote cooperation among
states-parties, at the second BWC review conference in 1986 member
states agreed to implement a set of confidence-building measures. Under
these politically binding measures, states should: Exchange data on
high-containment research centers and laboratories or on centers and
laboratories that specialize in permitted biological activities related
to the convention. Exchange information on abnormal outbreaks of
infectious diseases. Encourage the publication of biological research
results related to the BWC and promote the use of knowledge gained from
this research. Promote scientific contact on biological research related
to the convention. Third Review Conference At the third BWC review
conference in 1991, the scope of the first measure was expanded to
include national biological defense programs and the second and fourth
measures were slightly modified. In addition, three more measures were
added to this list. States should: Declare legislation, regulations, and
\"other measures\" pertaining to the BWC. Declare offensive or defensive
biological research and development programs in existence since January
1, 1946. Declare vaccine production facilities. These endeavors have
been largely unsuccessful; the vast majority of states-parties have
consistently failed to submit declarations on their activities and
facilities. The 1991 review conference also tasked a group of
\"governmental experts\" to evaluate potential verification measures for
use in a future compliance protocol to the BWC. The group subsequently
considered 21 such measures and submitted a report to a special
conference of states-parties in 1994. Building off this report, the
conference tasked a second body, known as the Ad Hoc Group, with
negotiating a legally binding protocol to the BWC to strengthen the
convention. Ad Hoc Group The Ad Hoc Group met from January 1995 to July
2001 and aimed to finish its work before the fifth review conference,
which began in November 2001. During the course of the negotiations, the
group developed a protocol that envisioned states submitting to an
international body declarations of treaty-relevant facilities and
activities. That body would conduct routine on-site visits to declared
facilities and could conduct challenge inspections of suspect facilities
and activities as well. However, a number of fundamental issues---such
as the scope of on-site visits and the role export controls would play
in the regime---proved difficult to resolve. In March 2001, the Ad Hoc
Group\'s chairman issued a draft protocol containing language attempting
to strike a compromise on disputed issues. But in July 2001, at the Ad
Hoc Group\'s last scheduled meeting, the United States rejected the
draft and any further protocol negotiations, claiming such a protocol
could not help strengthen compliance with the BWC and could hurt U.S.
national security and commercial interests. Fifth Review Conference The
fifth BWC review conference, which many experts thought could resolve
the fate of the Ad Hoc Group, was suspended on its last day, December 7,
2001, after the United States tabled a controversial proposal to
terminate the Ad Hoc Group\'s mandate and replace it with an annual
meeting of BWC states parties. The United States was the only country
that favored revoking the group\'s mandate. The states parties resumed
the fifth review conference in November 2002, but failed to agree on any
verification measures, including the proposed protocol. Sixth Review
Conference The sixth BWC review conference, which met between November
20 and December 8, 2006, was the was the first successful review
conference since 1996, reaching agreement on a final document The
conference produced a list of four work programs held each successive
year until the next review conference in 2011. Some issues that enjoyed
broad-based support did not make it into the work program. The United
States and Russia opposed proposals to reform confidence-building
measures on the basis that participation in the existing mechanisms is
poor. Russia was the primary factor behind bio-terrorism being dropped
from the list of agenda items. States parties did agree to address the
BWC's institutional deficit through the creation of the Implementation
Support Unit (ISU), which is staffed by three permanent employees based
in Geneva. The permanent staff members will be paid by the BWC and will
be housed in the UN Department of Disarmament Affairs in Geneva.
Previously, the BWC review conference was only supported on a part-time
basis. The ISU's mandate is to provide administrative support for the
BWC as well as facilitating confidence-building measures between states
parties. The ISU will, among other things, serve to ease communication
between states parties, as well as compile and disseminate
confidence-building measures submitted from states parties. Since the
conclusion of the 2006 review conference the ISU has been strengthened
in terms of budget and staff. Despite initial U.S. opposition, an EU
proposal to allow states parties to make additional, voluntary
contributions to the ISU was accepted during the 2007 annual meeting.
The United States originally objected to the proposal on the grounds
that it would increase the responsibility of the ISU. However, this
problem was resolved through a statement stressing that the ISU has only
three staff members, and any contributions are only designed to assist
the ISU in completing its mandate. During the 2008 meeting of states
parties, the EU provided a \$2 million dollar donation to the ISU in
order to pay for two additional staff members for the following two
years. The two new staff are officially assigned to the UN Office for
Disarmament Affairs, to avoid any conflict over a perceived expansion of
ISU. Seventh Review Conference The seventh BWC review conference was
held in December 2011. [The Final Declaration document concluded that
"under all circumstances the **use of bacteriological** (biological) and
toxin weapons is effectively **prohibited by the Convention** and
affirms the determination of States parties **to condemn** any use of
biological agents or toxins other than for peaceful purposes, by anyone
at any time.\"]{.underline} Eighth Review Conference The eighth BWC
review conference took place in November 2016. At the end of the
conference, delegates agreed to a future one-week meeting of
states-parties at the end of the year and a five-year extension of the
BWC Implementation Support Unit. Ninth Review Conference The ninth BWC
review conference was repeatedly postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
It is scheduled to be held in August 2022.

Biodiversity,\" EcoMENA,
<https://www.ecomena.org/impacts-of-biological-warfare-on-biodiversity/>\]//MaizeDS

[**Biological weapons are considered the most dangerous** of all known
**weapons of mass destruction**. They are used to deliberately cause
epidemics among humans; destroy the environmental components, including
water, air, and soil; and target crops and livestock.]{.underline}
Examples of diseases used in biological warfare include anthrax,
smallpox, plague, cholera, and avian flu. [In addition to the
catastrophic effects of biological warfare on the biodiversity and the
environment]{.underline}, [their danger lies in their low cost and
**rapid spread**, as well as their easy preparation, transport, and
use.]{.underline} Unlike nuclear and chemical bombs[, biological bombs
are without odor or color and therefore cannot be detected.
Additionally, **bioweapons are dangerous because of their effects on
untargeted organisms** in a military attack, and the clinical symptoms
they create may be difficult to distinguish from normal
diseases.]{.underline} [Bioweapon pathogens remain in nature for several
years and are able to survive in harsh environmental conditions.
Bioweapons spread germs that contaminate air, food, water, and the
environment, causing epidemiological diseases for different living
organisms.]{.underline} Air: [A wide variety of germs can contaminate
air and are used in biological warfare]{.underline}. Fungi are the most
common, and they travel by air over long distances to infect healthy
plants. Food: [Food contamination is also one of the most powerful
methods used to carry out biological warfare attacks. Disease is
transmitted either directly to humans through contaminated food or drink
or indirectly by hosts.]{.underline} Water: [Water can spread a number
of lethal infectious agents as well. For example, one gram of
Clostridium tetani poison is able to **kill eight million people within
six hours**]{.underline}. Diseases are one of the main drivers of
extinction in endangered species; therefore, disease control is
fundamental to preserve biodiversity. [Despite the presence of vaccines
and drugs for most bioweapons, they may not be available in adequate
quantities to cope with an epidemiological disease outbreak. Biological
attacks pose a threat to naturally rare wild plants and animals and to
species whose natural habitats have been degraded by human activities.
Furthermore, diseases that humans, domestic animals, and domestic plants
have been able to develop immunity to can be fatal in wild animals and
plants. **Bioweapons** are not only having **direct effects** on the
genetic biodiversity of indigenous species but also are having direct
and indirect catastrophic effects on vital plant and animal
communities]{.underline}. Conservation of livestock breeds is essential
to maintaining genetic diversity, which in turn is vital to increasing
the ability of living organisms to adapt to environmental changes. The
danger of bioweapons regarding animal biodiversity is summarized in
three main points: 1. The direct impact of diseases on wild species Some
d[eadly diseases in humans or domestic animals can infect wild
animals.]{.underline} For instance, an epidemic destructive impact on
endangered species is reflected in the effects of Canine distemper, a
natural viral disease that infects wild dogs and wild animals belonging
to the same group. Canine distemper was also developed in bioweapon
laboratories. Over the past decade[, the spread of this disease has
resulted in habitat loss and in the extinction of a large number of wild
species in North America]{.underline}. Additionally, it led to the
elimination of about one-third of the lion population in Tanzania and
had serious impacts on the endangered leopard population. 2. Invasive
species The history of rinderpest in Africa provides a model for
predicting the potential effects of lethal diseases on wild species and
livestock. In 1887, European colonial armies introduced the rinderpest
virus to Africa through imported cattle, which led to a rinderpest
outbreak among domestic cattle breeds and wild species, killing an
estimated 90--95% of African cattle and buffaloes within three years. To
control the epidemic, African herds and buffaloes have been destroyed in
most parts of Africa. Despite efforts to combat rinderpest over the past
century, the disease is still strong, and its outbreak in the region
occurs frequently. 3. Elimination of animal species, hosts, and vectors
Threatened species may be destroyed in areas that have been subjected to
biological attacks with the aim of eradicating the disease. For example,
in the United States, programs to control brucellosis in livestock have
resulted in killing large numbers of wild animals, including the Bison
and the white tailed deer. Microbes can be used in crop destruction. For
instance, "Rice blast" is a disease affecting rice and therefore leads
to crop destruction and genetic changes in the plant. [The discussion
about controlling destructive **bioweapons** is growing, as they **pose
a vast danger to both humanity and the environment** alike. Any failure
to prevent biological attacks can lead to the deterioration of genetic
diversity in animals and plants, the extinction of endangered species,
and the destruction of human livelihoods and traditional
cultures]{.underline}. Biotechnology has increased the economical value
of genetic diversity of living organisms; hence, it has increased the
risk of eliminating genetic diversity through the use of GMO bioweapons.
[Most of all, the environment will be the silent victim of this
war]{.underline}. It is not easy to put an end to the biological arms
race, so [global efforts must be consolidated to combat these threats.
Countries must strengthen their ability to detect early
attacks.]{.underline} Biologists and economists need to communicate with
decision makers to convince them of the importance of developing defense
systems to face bioweapons and limit their environmental and
socioeconomical effects. Certainly[, it is **necessary** to raise
awareness regarding the dangers of biological warfare.]{.underline}
[Interdisciplinary and international efforts are required to increase
the surveillance, monitoring, and identification of pathogens and to
better understand the dynamics of disease transmission within human,
plant, and animal populations. This will greatly enhance our ability to
combat the effects of bioweapons and emerging diseases on
biodiversit]{.underline}y.

When someone is throwing nukes at you, you can probably tell where
they\'re coming from. There\'s only a few nuclear nations and, over the
decades of the Cold War, they have developed complex strategic
intelligence and early warning networks. But [what about a cyber
war?]{.underline} Particularly [the kind of]{.underline} intense
multi-vector [cyber attack targeting critical
infrastructur]{.underline}e that\'s been dubbed as [cyber
blitzkrieg](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyber-blitzkrieg-replaces-cyber-pearl-harbor/)?
**[Cyber attribution is hard. It\'s not impossible, but it takes
time]{.underline}**. Time that doesn\'t exist when your infrastructure
is collapsing and you\'re thinking about resorting to what is
euphemistically called a \"kinetic response\". **[Retaliation against
the wrong target could]{.underline}** well **[result in
disaster]{.underline}**. **[One]{.underline}** possible
**[solution]{.underline}**, at least in part, **[could be installing
direct \"cyber hotlines\" between national leaders]{.underline}**.
**[The [Moscow--Washington
hotline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow%E2%80%93Washington_hotline)]{.underline}**
of Cold War fame **[is the archetype]{.underline}**. During the
high-stakes nuclear [Cuban Missile
Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis) of 1962,
official diplomatic messages took up to six hours to deliver. Presidents
John F Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev had to resort to unofficial
channels, including relaying messages via TV news correspondents. The
Moscow--Washington hotline was installed the following year. This
hotline was never the iconic red telephone of TV and movies. At first it
was a teletype, then a fax machine, and now email. Initially, its
terrestrial phone lines were backed up by a radio link via Tangier in
northwestern Morocco. Today, a set of satellite links are backed up by
optical fibre. At least eight other pairs of nations have [developed
their own hotlines](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Hotlines).
**[Cyber]{.underline}** [versions of these]{.underline}
**[hotlines]{.underline}** **[are a key recommendation of
the]{.underline}** [[Cyberspace Solarium
Commission]{.underline}](https://www.solarium.gov)
(**[CSC),]{.underline}** a US government initiative **[to]{.underline}**
\"**[develop a consensus on a strategic approach]{.underline}**\"
**[to]{.underline}** **[defending the nation against]{.underline}**
\"**[cyber attacks of significant consequences\".]{.underline}** \"The
US government should develop **[a multi-tiered signaling]{.underline}**
\[sic\] **[strategy aimed]{.underline}** at altering adversaries\'
decision calculus and **[addressing risks of escalation.]{.underline}**
This signaling strategy should **[also effectively]{.underline}**
**[communicate]{.underline}** to allies and partners US goals and
**[intent]{.underline}**,\" says the CSC\'s [final
report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view)
\[PDF\]. \"The **[strategic level of signaling]{.underline}** **[should
involve]{.underline}** overt, public **[diplomatic]{.underline}**
**[signaling]{.underline}** through traditional mechanisms that have
already been established for other domains, **[as well as private
diplomatic communications]{.underline}** **[through]{.underline}**
mechanisms such as **[hotlines]{.underline}** and other nonpublic
channels (including third party channels in instances in which the
United States may lack robust diplomatic relationships).\" At the
operational level, **[this should include]{.underline}** \"clandestine,
**[protected]{.underline}**, **[and covert signaling]{.underline}**
(including through non-cyber means) **[that is]{.underline}**
deliberately **[coupled with cyber operations]{.underline}**,\" the CSC
wrote. \"An example of this type of signaling is tailored messaging
preceding or running concurrently with defend forward cyber
operations.\" The CSC also recommends developing a framework to guide
\"when and under what conditions the US government will voluntarily
self-attribute cyber operations and campaigns for the purposes of
signaling capability and intent to various audiences\". **[Diplomatic
tools like hotlines]{.underline}** **[are]{.underline}** examples of
what diplomats call \"**[confidence building measures]{.underline}**\".
Confidence building **[is one of]{.underline}** four **[pillars of cyber
diplomacy]{.underline}** Your writer has previously reported on
Australia\'s part in developing the so-called [11 international
norms](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyberwar-looms-as-diplomats-dither/)
for nation-state behaviour in cyberspace and last year\'s [restart of
the UN\'s stalled
process](https://www.zdnet.com/article/australia-to-keep-playing-the-un-cyberspace-norms-game/)
for negotiating such rules. Last month, the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade (DFAT) reported that it was [progressing work on the
norms](https://www.zdnet.com/article/australia-progressing-work-on-agreed-norms-of-responsible-state-behaviour-in-cyberspace/).
Norms of behaviour are only a quarter of the cyber diplomacy story,
however. \"You have binding international law, you have voluntary
non-binding norms, which complement and together set clear expectations
of behaviour,\" said Johanna Weaver, Australia\'s cyber negotiator at
the UN. \"You have **[capacity building]{.underline}**, which **[is a
really important part of it]{.underline}** \... **[to make
sure]{.underline}** that all **[countries have the ability to implement
the recommendations and agreements]{.underline}**,\" she told ZDNet.
\"Then you\'ve got **[confidence building measures]{.underline}**, which
are **[designed to increase trust and transparency]{.underline}**.\"
While the building of **[hotlines]{.underline}** **[has not yet become a
priority at the UN,]{.underline}** there has been modest progress at the
regional level in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Australia and Malaysia\'s proposal for a [regional cyber points of
contact
directory](https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/themes/cyber-affairs/Pages/building-confidence-in-cyberspace-through-the-development-of-a-regional-cyber-points-of-contact-directory)
received in-principle endorsement at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
Intersessional Meeting on Security of and in the use of ICTs in
Singapore back in March 2019. \"The directory will provide a means of
direct communication to prevent miscalculation and escalation, as well
as manage potential responses in the event of cybersecurity incidents
with the potential to impact regional security,\" DFAT wrote. A cyber
equivalent to the International Atomic Energy Agency? The UN\'s
Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), one of the two UN bodies negotiating
the rules for cyberspace, has stressed the importance of accurate
attribution of cyber attacks. \"It was suggested that **[developing a
common approach to attribution]{.underline}** at the technical level
**[could lead to greater accountability, transparency, and
c]{.underline}**ould help support **[legal recourse for those harmed by
malicious acts]{.underline}**,\" OEWG wrote in the [initial
pre-draft](https://unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/200311-Pre-Draft-OEWG-ICT.pdf)
\[PDF\] of its report. Australia has noted that attribution comes in two
flavours. One is factual attribution, \"the factual circumstances,
including the technical indicators that allow you to make an assessment
as to a technical assessment of attribution,\" Weaver said during a
briefing in April. \"Then there is a legal attribution assessment, which
is taking into account the considerations of state responsibility. Can
you take those technical or factual circumstances and say this is
therefore attributable to a particular government?\" Separate from that
is any political decision to act publicly or privately on both of those
attribution assessments, she said. To this end, the Geneva-based
ICT4Peace Foundation has proposed what they\'ve dubbed to be a Global
Cyber Attribution Network. \"ICT4Peace proposes the setting up of an
independent network of organisations engaging in attribution
peer-review,\" the organisation wrote in its policy brief [Trust and
Attribution in
Cyberspace](https://ict4peace.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ICT4Peace-2019-Trust-and-Attribution-in-Cyberspace.pdf)
\[PDF\]. Currently, most attribution is done by private cyber threat
intelligence organisations and national security agencies. \"**[For
international legal provisions]{.underline}** **[to be
effective]{.underline}**, and **[accountability]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** malicious **[cyber activities]{.underline}** to
**[take hold, high levels of confidence and]{.underline}** publicly
**[persuasive attribution of responsibility are
required]{.underline}**,\" ICT4Peace wrote. This new independent
attribution agency should include \"government representatives, private
sector pundits as well as proponents from civil society and academia\".
Microsoft has also suggested, in 2017, an [attribution organisation to
strengthen trust
online](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/an-attribution-organization-to-strengthen-trust-online)
as part of its Digital Geneva Convention proposal. Such an agency has
been compared with the long-established International Atomic Energy
Agency, but the cyber world is vastly different. \"Nuclear technology is
industrial by design. It is difficult, if not impossible, to develop
nuclear capabilities in hiding. Also, military use of nuclear technology
is very different from civilian use,\" ICT4Peace wrote. \"Cyber
capabilities on the other hand are software based. In contrast to
nuclear technology, cyber tools do not emit suspicious radiation and do
not require factories for their development. A handful of dedicated
individuals gathered in a room can launch a cyberattack of sizeable
magnitude.\" While an independent agency wouldn\'t be able to provide
real-time attribution during a cyber attack, its existence and its
ability to subsequently validate or refute a nation\'s claims could
provide a break on cyber escalation. ZDNet understands that the idea of
an IAEA-style cyber inspection agency is raised at the UN from time to
time, including in the OEWG intersessional multi-stakeholder
consultations, but for various reasons, it has yet to gain traction.

Russky Newsweek, the Russian-language edition of Newsweek, ran a cover
story in its November 23, 2009, is- sue on cyber crime that pointed a
very big finger at Russian hackers working from home and abroad. It used
terms like the "Evil Cyber Empire" and the "Cold Cyber War." At the same
time, NATO is trying to understand how it should deal with cybersecurity
issues. Does a cyber attack on a NATO member state trigger the Article V
commitment of the mutual defense treaty? Geopolitics during the Cold War
was about borders and defending them. **[Cyber diplomacy in the
twenty-first century]{.underline}** **[is about managing]{.underline}**
a world **[that is not just borderless]{.underline}** **[but can
function best when connectivity]{.underline}** **[is almost
seamless]{.underline}**. **[This world]{.underline}**---so dependent on
stable financial transactions and global trading---**[cannot function at
all if cyber connectivity is successfully attacked]{.underline}**. **[So
how does NATO]{.underline}**, **[a geographically defined
alliance]{.underline}** **[trying to redefine its relationship with
Russia]{.underline}**, **[understand its role in pro- moting cyber
diplomacy and cyber peace]{.underline}**? What should the institutional
structure and strategic profile of NATO look like if the biggest
security threats to it in the next ten years are from terrorists or
states with advanced cyber offensive capabilities? One big change will
be in espionage. It will continue but its fundamental character will
change. Russia will change its intelligence-gathering priorities in NATO
countries, and the United States will change its espionage priorities in
Russia. All parties will become more interested in pro- tecting at least
some of the others' secrets than in stealing them, because to do so will
buttress their own economic security. For **[NATO]{.underline}**, **[the
time has definitely arrived for it to el- evate
cybersecurity]{.underline}** to the top rank of issues **[to be dealt
with in its official relations with Russia]{.underline}**; **[the two
sides have a shared interest in seeking common solutions, not simply
looking at each other as potential threats.]{.underline}** A low-profile
speech by the vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General
James E. Cartwright, in June 2009 gave a glimpse of an emerging
strategic concept in the world's only military superpower---something he
dubbed "global strike."91 He said that the low-end capa- bility for
global strike "is probably \[the ability to be\] any place on the face
of the earth in an hour," while the "high end is any place on the face
of the earth in about 300 mil- liseconds---that's cyber." This view was
expressed during a discussion of the forthcoming quadrennial review of
the country's military planning and capability. It flowed from
Cartwright's vision of what deterrence looks like in the twenty-first
century. Citing the proliferation of ballistic missiles, Cartwright
observed that a new attack---potentially nuclear---"could be over in
minutes." This circumstance would require, he said, "something that
deters that conflict and it has to be more than nuclear." For him, part
of the argument is that his country's military bases are located "where
we fought the Indians, the Japanese and the Germans." He suggested that
current basing realities might not address the needs of deterring or
responding to new threats.

influence of NATO and plays toward the Russian strategic goal of
marginalizing NATO wherever possible.149 Rather than sitting on the
sidelines as the cyber domain is evolving around it, **[NATO has the
opportunity]{.underline}** and the need now **[to match its actions to
its rhetoric by accepting Russian]{.underline}** overtures **[to
cooperate on cybersecurity]{.underline}**. It should build internal
consensus on engaging Russia with relatively low-cost, low-risk measures
where both sides can easily find agreement as first steps toward an
eventually more substantial partnership that tackles the thornier
problems where the two sides have fundamental differences. Specifically,
**[NATO should seek to cooperate with Russia to
accomplish]{.underline}** the following **[goals]{.underline}**. Add a
Cybersecurity Working Group to the NATO-Russia Council. Ideally, this
arrangement would establish a stand-alone working group on par with
working groups covering topics like missile defense, logistics, or
terrorism. If that were to provide too broad of a mandate for the
Alliance partners to agree to, it could be formed as a subgroup
underneath the Science for Peace and Security Committee with a much
narrower and more technical purview. In any case, forming a working
group at the NRC would signal the intention to work seriously with
Russia on cybersecurity and would provide an organizational venue for
doing so.150 Partner Computer Emergency Response Teams. Regardless of
the level of trust between NATO and the Russian Federation, having
contacts established between the technical experts who have the ability
to respond in the event of a crisis is invaluable.151 NATO should
collectively adopt the pragmatic stance of some of its member states and
begin a series of limited, technically-oriented exchanges between the
NATO Computer Incident Response Capability Technical Center and the
Russian CERT in order to exchange technical information and determine
how best to communicate during a crisis. Share Cyber Intel. Because
cyberspace is constantly evolving and the nefarious actors who operate
within it are continually adapting, maintaining up-to-date information
on cyber threats is an endless challenge. Likewise, **[sharing
intelligence across NATO]{.underline}** **[can be]{.underline}** a
sensitive and **[difficult]{.underline}** process, so any proposal for
trading secrets with Russia might on the surface seem dubious - except
that [during an]{.underline} [April 2013 **visit to
Moscow,**]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}** Deputy
**[Secretary-General]{.underline}** Alexander Vershbow **[proposed the
creation of two centers to allow Russia and NATO to share
intelligence]{.underline}**, conduct joint planning, and coordinate
operations on missile defense.152 While a final agreement on
establishing these centers is nowhere near, missile defense has been as
much of a source of friction between the **[U.S., NATO, and
Russia]{.underline}** as **[cybersecurity]{.underline}**, so the
proposed **[facilities]{.underline}** **[provide a template for a cyber
threat information clearinghouse as another space for NATO and Russia to
cooperate]{.underline}**. Such a clearinghouse could start small and
work initially on shared analysis of excellent but unclassified data
from commercial cybersecurity firms and, as trust is built, graduate to
more sensitive and classified intelligence products.153 **[Develop
Confidence-Building Measures]{.underline}**. The Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is nearing completion of a set
of **[confidence-building measures]{.underline}** (CBMs) intended to
**[prevent misunderstandings]{.underline}** **[and avert international
conflicts among its]{.underline}** fifty-seven member
**[countries]{.underline}**.154 Although the publicly available draft of
the measures reveals them to be voluntary and not particularly
robust,155 the agreement, once finalized, will be important for having
started a conversation on cybersecurity among over a quarter of the
world\'s nation-states and in facilitating the exchange of cybersecurity
terminology, doctrine, and contacts among the members. **[NATO
should]{.underline}** build on the OSCE agenda to **[pursue a
more]{.underline}** detailed and more **[ambitious set of CBMs with
Russia]{.underline}**, including joint early-warning mechanisms,
exchanges of technical cybersecurity recommendations, **[and improvement
of cyber crisis communication]{.underline}**
**[channels]{.underline}**.156 Given that all twenty-eight NATO
countries and Russia are part of the OSCE, achieving consensus on
confidence-building measures at the NRC should be attainable, and it
would go a long way to addressing Russia\'s almost paralyzing fears of
being blamed for a cyber incident in which it legitimately played no
role.157 And since NATO and Russia have a long track record of devising
CBMs related to nuclear weapons, adapting those existing procedures and
processes to cybersecurity would appear eminently achievable.

**[Cyber]{.underline}** **[and space]{.underline}** **[is a promising
arena]{.underline}** **[for NATO]{.underline}** **[to address
China]{.underline}** challenges **[by building member state
resilience.]{.underline}** Like the air and sea domains, as areas that
belong to no one state and which provide access to much of the globe,
**[they form part of the global commons]{.underline}**. Command of the
commons has been the key enabler of the US global position of power for
many
decades.[26](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
However, **[China wields]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}**
**[sufficient]{.underline}** range of sea, air, **[cyber, and space
capabilities]{.underline}** such that the global commons is now a
contested zone. In contrast to the sea and air domains, cyber and space
are sparsely regulated. This **[lack of international norms enhances the
risk of conflict based on misperception]{.underline}**, **[making NATO
cooperation pertinent]{.underline}**. Adversarial activities toward the
US and Europe in the cyber and space domain threaten transatlantic
security. These come not just from China, but also from other
adversaries such as Russia and Iran. Mechanisms for addressing these
challenges in the military sector are essentially generic and not, at
least in their basic design, established with a particular country in
mind. Thus, cyber and space provide an avenue for NATO to contribute
significantly to deterrence of China without having to combat major
internal resistance. NATO would also benefit from long-standing US-EU
cooperation on cyber and space
issues.[27](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
**[Cyber and space provide an avenue for NATO to
contribute]{.underline}** **[without major internal
resistance]{.underline}** NATO has vowed to clarify Article Five's
collective defense commitment to encompass threats to satellites in
space and coordinated cyberattacks. NATO can design this effort to
include adversarial behavior from China. The alliance already has an
array of instruments to deal with cyber and space challenges from
adversaries. These can be extended to encompass China without
pronouncing it a
threat.[28](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
This approach allows the US and Europe time to adjust their cooperation
to take into account the fact that China poses military threats to them
both without explicitly using the language of threat at a time when NATO
members do not agree if China should be defined as a challenge that can
trigger Article Five responses. Since the late 1990s, the vulnerability
of shared space assets to cyberattacks has been a concern for both the
US and Europe. For example, in 1998 a US-German satellite, used for
peering into deep space, was rendered useless after it turned suddenly
toward the sun, damaging its High Resolution Imager by exposure. NASA
later determined that the accident was linked to a cyber-intrusion at
the Goddard Space Flight Center. Coordinated cyberattacks have emerged
as a major threat to both the US and Europe since the late 1990s. For
example, for about eighteen minutes on April 8, 2010, China Telecom
advertised erroneous network traffic routes that instructed US and other
foreign internet traffic to travel through Chinese servers. Other
servers around the world quickly adopted these paths, routing all
traffic, including government and military traffic, to about 15 percent
of the internet's destinations through servers located in
China.[29](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
In the future, the need to enhance situational awareness in space is
likely to lead to further integration of space assets between the US and
its allies. Civilian entry points are likely to provide a growing
opportunity for infiltration. The weak state of cybersecurity in
civilian agencies should also be considered. Chinese military doctrine
prioritizes weaponry that targets vulnerabilities in the deployment of
US and allied power, such as the use of cyberattacks to disrupt
surveillance assets, intelligence networks, and command-and-control
systems.[30](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
These threats are significant, since next generation systems, including
fighter aircraft, destroyers, and special forces, will not function
without access to space communication and space-derived data. Although
European and US allies have indigenous space programs outside the NATO
framework, cyber security and outer space would be a useful field for
joint explorations of how to divert and manage attacks and identify an
agency which can coordinate transatlantic responses to attacks. Allies
are embedded in a range of information networks which may be disrupted,
giving rise to alliance management concerns emerging from attacks. The
**[lack of red lines]{.underline}** **[regarding behavior]{.underline}**
**[in cyber and outer space]{.underline}** **[between the US and its
allies]{.underline}** on one hand, **[and adversaries]{.underline}**
such as China on the other, **[adds to the risk of misperception and
escalation]{.underline}**, and hence also **[highlights the need for
allied coordination]{.underline}** to avoid starting a war by mistake.
**[An improved NATO dialogue on safeguards and alliance consultation
could also assist communication with China on arms control and conflict
prevention in cyber and outer space,]{.underline}** which is not
currently taking place. Looking to the future, NATO's success in
establishing transatlantic mechanisms for cyber and outer space
safeguards and consultation will be crucial to allow NATO a key role in
taking on the China challenge in ways that help restore faith in NATO's
credibility as a provider of collective defense in all domains. It will
also assist NATO in straddling the chasm between member states
prioritizing threats from either China, Russia, the Middle East, or
North Africa, since cyber and space threats potentially stem from all of
them, and the effectiveness of cyber and space defense mechanisms do not
necessarily depend on geographical origin. Cyber and space would allow
NATO a key role in the China challenge without prioritizing China
**[Improved communication]{.underline}** between NATO and the EU **[will
be essential for NATO to successfully address the military aspects of
cyber and space threats.]{.underline}** The framework for permanent
EU-NATO relations, Berlin Plus, was concluded in March 2003. It allows
for the exchange of classified information, the EU's use of NATO assets
and capabilities for EU-led crisis management operations, and the
establishment of consultation
arrangements.[31](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
Due to disagreements over responsibilities and jurisdiction, however,
meaningful coordination did not take place until July 2016. On this
occasion, NATO and the EU issued a joint declaration stating their
intention to work together on security and defense responses to
unprecedented challenges emanating from the South and East of the
Euro-Atlantic
area.[32](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)During
Biden's visit to Brussels in June 2021, NATO promised to strengthen
cooperation with the EU on promoting peace and stability including
protecting critical infrastructure, strengthening resilience,
maintaining a technological edge, and addressing challenges to a
rules-based
order.[33](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
The EU-US summit statement from the same visit merely reaffirms support
for robust NATO-EU cooperation and promises to strengthen the
partnership.[34](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)
At the level of policy implementation, it is clear when talking to NATO
and EU officials that usually they do not coordinate their strategies
and tactics for countering China
challenges.[35](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145)

#### China wants cyber diplomacy to maintain interdependence with the West

//DamienHS WAgustin

In absolute terms, the People\'s Republic of China is the European
Union\'s largest trading partner. China is its most significant source
of imports and second-largest export market. The EU is second only to
the United States as China\'s top trade partner.207 In the framework of
the EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation signed in 2013 - the
strategy that guides comprehensive bilateral cooperation - the EU and
China agreed to establish strategic partnership across a wide range of
issues, including sustainable development, economic prosperity, global
governance, foreign policy, security and peace.208 In 2017, China and
Europol reached an agreement known as the \"Europol-China Strategic
Cooperation Framework\" to increase law enforcement cooperation directed
at combating transnational crime. The 2016 Joint Communication on
\"Elements for a new EU strategy on China\", adopted by the High
Representative, the European Commission209 and the EU Council\'s
Strategy on China210 further clarified EU priorities vis-à-vis China. In
line with the EU\'s overarching engagement strategy, it put special
attention on human rights, the rule of law, social-economic issues,
trade and investment and market access. **[The EU]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}** repeatedly **[highlighted the need to
curb]{.underline}** industrial **[cyber espionage by intensifying
cooperation with China]{.underline}** on reforming the country\'s
\"protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights\"211
through mechanisms such as the Intellectual Property Rights Infringement
Protection212 and the EU-China Strategic Framework for Customs
Cooperation on IPR for 2018-2020.213 Underscoring the importance of
intellectual property rights protection in Europe, and building on
synergies with Japan and the USTR Section 301 Report, the EU has also
launched a case at the WTO against China\'s \"unfair \[and forced\]
technology transfers\" and discriminatory treatment of foreign
companies.214 5.2 China\'s engagement with the EU and EU member states
**[The]{.underline}** landmark 2015 [Xi-Obama]{.underline} industrial
[cyber espionage agreement]{.underline} [has served as a template for EU
member states\']{.underline} **[cyber-related bilateral partnerships
with China]{.underline}**. Both [the United Kingdom]{.underline}
(2016)215 [and Germany]{.underline} (2015)216 **[have convinced China to
formally adopt a norm against cyber espionage in bilateral
accords]{.underline}**, **[commit to hold a regular
dialogue]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}** pertinent **[cyber
issues]{.underline}** **[and cooperate in]{.underline}** the fields of
**[incident mitigation]{.underline}**, CERTs assistance, cybercrime and
CBMs. European member states\' diplomatic approach to China has
therefore been more functional and in pursuit of concrete practical
outcomes of benefit for both sides. From EU countries\' vantage point,
this type of functional cooperation with China is necessary as it
transcends unsurmountable differences between the two sides\' normative
preferences, threat perceptions and security interests. For decades,
Sino-European Union relations have been characterised by consistently
growing economic and cultural ties. Accommodating China\'s economic rise
and appetite to shape international order has given rise to greater
technological interdependence in tandem with tremendous new normative,
security and political challenges. **[China\'s growing
assertiveness]{.underline}** - particularly its growing political reach
in Europe, which is often perceived as a lever to undermine the cohesion
of the Union - has eventually **[compelled the EU to fundamentally
redefine its China strategy]{.underline}** from an accommodation-based
engagement policy tow**[ards one of balancing]{.underline}** and
\"**[managed]{.underline}** **[interdependence]{.underline}**\" in key
strategic sectors and supply chains, with an emphasis on ensuring market
reciprocity.217 2019 saw the European Union chart a new bolder course
vis-à-vis China. In March 2019, weeks before the 21st EU-China Summit,
and coming after recommendations made by the Federation of German
Industries and other European actors (member states, other industry
federations, etc.) earlier that year,218 the European Commission
published an official document (\"EU-China - A strategic outlook\")
describing a new \"EU policy shift towards a more realistic, assertive,
and multi-faceted approach\" to dealing with China.219 The **[EU
asserts]{.underline}** that despite **[China being a cooperation and
negotiating \"partner\"]{.underline}** with which the EU needs to
(re)align objectives and strike a \"balance of interests\", the PRC has
increasingly become a \"systemic rival\" and an \"economic competitor\"
that leverages economic investment to achieve geopolitical gains,
energetically pursues global \"technological leadership\" and seeks to
export norms and forms of governance at odds with neoliberalism.
Furthermore, the profoundly intertwined role of the CCP in China\'s
economy and the opaque and highly blended divisions between the public
and private spheres and the military have made Chinese technology a
security risk for the EU in the \"short to mid-term\". Overall, the
EU\'s more critical stance before the 2019 summit has helped secure
several concessions from the Chinese side. **[Concerning EU-China
cooperation]{.underline}** **[in cyberspace]{.underline}**, the **[two
sides will continue working towards implementing norms of responsible
state behaviour]{.underline}** under the EU-China Cyber Task Force
framework and within parallel UN processes. While affirming that \"there
should be no forced technology transfers\", the two sides also committed
themselves to enhancing resilience against malicious cyber activities,
including against cyber-enabled intellectual property theft. The two
sides also committed to a concrete timeline to conclude the \"EU-China
Comprehensive Investment Agreement\", for which \"decisive progress\"
from the Chinese side - i.e. substantial market-opening reforms directed
at ensuring a level playing field - will be required in 2019.225
Furthermore, China and the EU are to cooperate on reforming the WTO,
though this will be conditional on China reforming the discriminatory
effects of industrial state subsidies and other related issues.

China and Russia have opened a direct presidential hot line to improve
understanding between the former communist rivals, the Foreign Ministry
announced Tuesday. The secure telecommunications link, China's first
with a foreign capital, will allow presidents Jiang Zemin and Boris
Yeltsin to \`\`exchange views on bilateral relations and international
issues at any time,″ Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.
**[U.S. Secretary of State]{.underline}** **[Madeleine

Minister Tang Jiaxuan signed an agreement]{.underline}** **[for
a]{.underline}** **[U.S.-China hot line]{.underline}** last week, but

1960s. Relations have improved steadily over the past decade.

#### Security Cooperation is administered by the DoD, Security Assistance is DoS

[U.S. Code Title 22 provides congressional authority to conduct DoS
Security Assistance programs]{.underline}. The programs are carried out
through two basic laws, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and the
Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA).24 AECA enacted congressional
legislative controls over export of defense articles and services. The
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs
Committee are responsible for foreign assistance and Security Assistance
program authorization legislation. The Senate and House Armed Services
Committees are responsible for defense programs authorization
legislation. [The term **security cooperation** is used within DoD,
whereas the term **security assistance** is used within the
DoS]{.underline}. It is important to note that these congressional
committees play a role only in FMS authorization. Although Congress
maintains legislative control over exports, FMS is a nonappropriated
program, external to the U.S. budget, and the president is charged with
signing off on spending for the program. Through Executive Order 11958,
as amended, the President delegates selected functions in the AECA to
the secretaries of State and Defense. They are required to provide
reports to Congress and obtain specific congressional approval on
certain exports or transfers. [The DoS has responsibilities relating to
**security assistance**, which include managing the export of defense
articles, services, training, and military technology]{.underline}.25
[DoD has responsibilities relating to **security cooperation**, which
include activities to encourage and enable international partners to
work with the United States to achieve strategic
objectives]{.underline}.26 The military departments and other DoD
agencies involved in managing FMS programs are collectively called
implementing agencies (IAs). The Army, Navy, and Air Force usually have
the responsibility of being the IA in the process of FMS.27 The Air
Force agency for all security cooperation programs is the Office of the
Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs
(SAF/IA). The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition has
oversight in the execution by virtue of having responsibility for Air
Force acquisition. SAF/IA is supported by the Air Force Security
Assistance Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for most FMS
and other logistics functions. The Air Force Security Assistance
Training (AFSAT) squadron at Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is in
charge of planning and, with AETC, managing the Air Force international
military training. It is organized under the authority of AETC.

## Russian Sanctions Plank

Notes:

- Read the Terrorism turn as a NB (possibility)

- This was built for PGMs

- And say no as a solvency deficit to their plan -- not ALL members of
  NATO need to impose sanctions

- Change CP plank text especially if you want to get out of PDCP trouble
  -- You can put the EU and Britain instead of NATO

#### The United States Federal Government should propose to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to multilaterally impose sanctions and export controls on Russian defense contractors and their CEOs. 

#### Plank solves. Russian defense CEOs and companies alike have avoided Western sanctions, keeping Russia's military alive -- cutting them off at the head impairs the Russian military

[As Russia\'s military continues to pound Ukraine with missiles and
other lethal weapons]{.underline}, **[Western nations have
responded]{.underline}** in part **[by targeting
Russia\'s]{.underline}** **[defense]{.underline}** industry **[with
sanctions]{.underline}**. The latest round came on Tuesday, when the
United States issued new sanctions on some arms makers and executives at
the heart of what it dubbed Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s \"war
machine.\" But a Reuters examination of companies, [executives and
investors underpinning Russia\'s defense]{.underline} sector [shows a
sizable number of players have yet to pay a price]{.underline}: Nearly
**[three dozen leaders of Russian weapons firms and at least 14 defense
companies have not been sanctioned by the United States, the European
Union or the United Kingdom.]{.underline}** In addition, **[sanctions on
Russia\'s arms]{.underline}** makers and tycoons **[have been applied
inconsistently by these NATO allies]{.underline}**, with some
governments levying penalties and others not, the Reuters review showed.
[Among the weapons moguls who have not been sanctioned]{.underline} by
any of those three authorities [is]{.underline} [Alan
Lushnikov]{.underline}, the [largest shareholder of]{.underline}
**[Kalashnikov Concern JSC]{.underline}**, the original manufacturer of
the well-known AK-47 assault rifle. Lushnikov owns a 75% stake in the
firm, according to the most recent business records reviewed by Reuters.
The company itself was sanctioned by the United States in 2014, the year
Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. The EU and
UK leveled their own sanctions against Kalashnikov Concern this year.
**[The company accounts for 95% of Russia\'s production
of]{.underline}** machine **[guns]{.underline}**,
**[sniper]{.underline}** rifles, **[pistols]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** other **[handheld firearms]{.underline}**, **[and
98%]{.underline}** **[of its handheld military machine
guns]{.underline}**, according to its website and most recent annual
report. Its weapons include the AK-12 assault rifle, an updated version
of the AK-47, some of which have been captured from Russian forces by
Ukrainian soldiers. **[The Kalashnikov Concern also produces
missiles]{.underline}** that can be fired from aircraft or on land. A
former Russian deputy transport minister, Lushnikov once worked for
commodities tycoon Gennady Timchenko, a longtime friend of Putin. The
United States sanctioned Timchenko in 2014 following Russia's invasion
of Crimea, naming him as a member of the Kremlin's "inner circle."
Neither Lushnikov, Timchenko or the Kalashnikov Concern responded to
requests for comment. It's the [same]{.underline} pattern [with
Almaz-Antey Concern]{.underline}, a Moscow-based defense company
specializing in missiles and anti-aircraft systems. The company has been
sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK, but [CEO Yan Novikov has not
been punished]{.underline}. **[Almaz-Antey]{.underline}**'s website
displays the motto "Peaceful Sky is Our Profession." The company
**[makes Kalibr missiles]{.underline}**, **[which Russia's Ministry of
Defense has credited with destroying Ukrainian military
installations.]{.underline}** In a statement last month, the ministry
said Russia had fired long-range Kalibr missiles at a Ukrainian command
post near the village of Shyroka Dacha in eastern Ukraine, killing what
the ministry claimed were more than 50 generals and officers of the
Ukrainian military. Reuters was unable to independently verify that
claim. Neither Almaz-Antey nor CEO Novikov responded to requests for
comment. In response to a list of questions submitted by Reuters about
Western sanctions aimed at Russia, a Kremlin spokesperson said \"the
consistency and logic of imposing sanctions, as well as the legality of
imposing such restrictions, is a question that should be put directly to
the countries that introduced them.\" The Reuters findings come as
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that **[current Western
sanctions against Russia "are not enough]{.underline}**" as Russian
troops make gains in their assault on Ukraine's eastern regions of
Luhansk and Donetsk. The Ukrainian military has been outgunned by
Russian artillery in places such as the industrial city of
Sievierodonetsk, which it ceded to Russian forces last week after weeks
of intense fighting. Putin has portrayed his military's assault on
Ukraine as a "special military operation" aimed at demilitarizing and
"denazifying" its democratic neighbor. On Tuesday, Russia's Foreign
Ministry announced it would bar Jill Biden and Ashley Biden, the wife
and daughter of U.S. President Joe Biden, from entering Russia
indefinitely in what it said was a response to "constantly expanding
U.S. sanctions against Russian politicians and public figures." U.S.
National Security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday that Russia\'s
action was not surprising because \"the Russian capacity for these kinds
of cynical moves is basically bottomless.\" The Russian invasion has
killed thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, but the exact
number is unknown. The United Nations human rights office said, as of
Monday, that 4,731 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia's
invasion began on Feb. 24, including more than 300 children, with
another 5,900 civilians injured in the conflict. The agency said most of
the casualties were caused by the use of "explosive weapons with a wide
impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch
rocket systems, and missile and air strikes," and that the actual number
of dead and wounded was likely far higher. The West has levied sanctions
on a swath of Russia's economy to punish Moscow, an effort that so far
has done little to deter the Russian offensive. Like the bans on other
Russian firms, sanctions on weapons companies are meant to hamper their
ability to sell to foreign customers. These penalties limit their access
to imported components and generally make it more costly and
time-consuming to produce weaponry. **[Levying sanctions on the people
behind those firms goes a step further to make the pain
personal.]{.underline}** **[It allows Western nations to go
after]{.underline}** any mansions, yachts and other offshore
**[wealth]{.underline}** **[of those who supply Russia's military, and
it limits where they can travel abroad.]{.underline}** "You're
demonstrating that being a regime collaborator comes with a cost," said
Max Bergmann, a former State Department official during the Obama
administration who worked on U.S. arms transfers and safeguarding U.S.

You're creating a disgruntled class of people that are tied to the

companies in Russia's defense industry]{.underline}** identified by
Reuters **[that have not been sanctioned]{.underline}** by the United
States, EU or UK [include the V.A. Degtyarev
Plant]{.underline}[(ZDEGI.MM)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ZDEGI.MM),
a facility 165 miles northeast of Moscow that makes machine guns,
anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that are sold to the Russian
military. [Its weapons include the Kalashnikov PKM and PKTM **machine
guns**, as well as Kord]{.underline} rifles [and machine **guns**, some
of which are mounted on **armored vehicles**.]{.underline} The Degtyarev
Plant did not respond to a request for comment. [Also not sanctioned is
the Klimovsk Specialized Ammunition Plant]{.underline}, south of Moscow,
[where "world-famous **cartridges**" **for pistols** **and** Kalashnikov
**assault rifles are produced**]{.underline}, according to an archived
version of its website. Neither is the Novosibirsk Cartridge Plant, an
ammunition manufacturer that calls itself "one of the leading
engineering enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia."
Neither ammunition plant responded to requests for comment. Last month,
Reuters sought comments from sanctions officials in the UK, EU and
United States regarding the news agency's findings that they had failed
to punish a raft of Russian defense firms and tycoons fueling Putin's
war effort. As part of that process, Reuters provided those Western
authorities with a detailed list of more than 20 companies and more than
three-dozen people that had escaped sanctions. The UK's Foreign,
Commonwealth and Development Office, which levies sanctions for Britain,
said it could not comment on future sanctions. It added that London and
its allies had levied "the largest and most severe economic sanctions
that Russia has ever faced, to help cripple Putin's war machine." The
European Commission and the U.S. Treasury Department, which handle
sanctions for Brussels and Washington respectively, declined to comment
on the specifics of Reuters' findings. Elizabeth Rosenberg, assistant
secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes at the Treasury
Department, said in a statement that sanctions have "made it harder for
Russia to obtain what it needs to procure and produce weapons." On
Tuesday, in conjunction with a meeting of leaders of the G7 nations in
the German Alps, the Treasury Department released a new round of
defense-related sanctions that included eight of the weapons firms and
two of the executives on the list provided earlier by Reuters. One of
those newly sanctioned executives, Vladimir Artyakov, has played key
roles in Russia's weapons industry for decades, and serves as the No. 2
executive at Rostec, a military-industrial giant with hundreds of
subsidiaries employing more than half a million people, according to its
website and annual reports. **[Artyakov]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
also [the chairman of at least five Russian weapons firms]{.underline},
[among them Russian Helicopters JSC]{.underline}, **[which builds
several lines of military helicopters]{.underline}** including the Ka-52
\"Alligator,\" some of which have been shot down and documented in
Ukraine. **[He has not been sanctioned by the EU or UK]{.underline}**.
Artyakov and Russian Helicopters did not respond to requests for
comment. Rostec has been sanctioned by Washington since 2014. On Tuesday
the United States targeted the company again, levying sanctions on more
than 40 Rostec subsidiaries and affiliates. Among those hit was
Avtomatika Concern, a company linked to cyber warfare. It was on the
list of Russian defense firms that Reuters had submitted to the Treasury
Department last month seeking an explanation as to why the companies had
not been sanctioned. Rostec and Avtomatika Concern did not respond to
requests for comment. Other firms on Reuters' list that were sanctioned
just this week by the Treasury Department include PJSC Tupolev, a maker
of fighter jets such as the Tu-22M3 bomber. The Ukrainian military said
Tu-22M3 bombers were responsible for a missile strike at a crowded
shopping center in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday,
which killed at least 18 people and injured about 60. PJSC Tupolev and
another firm on Reuters' list, JSC VNII Signal, have not been sanctioned
by the EU or UK. JSC VNII Signal is a producer of mechanical and
navigational systems that power Russian military tanks and some of the
country's most advanced missile systems. PJSC Tupolev and JSC VNII
Signal did not respond to requests for comment. TOP BRASS UNTOUCHED
**[Executives]{.underline}** at a host **[of Russian weapons
firms]{.underline}**, meanwhile, **[have largely escaped
sanctions]{.underline}** from Western authorities. Nearly three months
after a Tochka-U ballistic missile hit a train station in the eastern
Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk on April 8, Russian weapons executives
linked to the company that makes those missiles have yet to pay a price.
The strike killed more than 50 people, including children, and injured
more than 100 others. The Russian firm JSC Research and Production
Corporation Konstruktorskoye Byuro Mashynostroyeniya, known as KBM, has
been the primary manufacturer of Tochka-U missiles, according to a U.S.
Army database of worldwide military equipment. Neither Washington,
Brussels or London have sanctioned Sergey Pitikov, KBM's chief
executive. The **[three Western allies have likewise spared Alexander
Denisov]{.underline}**, the **[CEO of NPO High Precision
Systems]{.underline}**, **[KBM's parent company]{.underline}**. High
Precision Systems **[oversees production of a wide range of missiles,
artillery, grenade launchers and machine guns used by Russian
troop]{.underline}**s **[and outfitted on military helicopters,
aircraft, tanks and warships]{.underline}**. **[Sanctions on Russia's
arms companies and tycoons have been applied inconsistently by the
Western allies]{.underline}**. The United States and EU have sanctioned
High Precision Systems, for example, while the UK has not. The United
States has sanctioned KBM, but the EU and UK have not. High Precision
Systems, Pitikov and Denisov did not respond to requests for comment.
KBM confirmed that Pitikov is its chief executive, but did not respond
to additional questions submitted by Reuters. **[Europe and the United
States have failed to coordinate sanctions]{.underline}** **[even on
makers of banned weapons.]{.underline}** Since the outset of Russia's
invasion in late February, [Western governments and human rights groups
have decried its use of cluster munitions:]{.underline} small bombs
delivered by missiles or rockets, which scatter and explode over an area
as large as a city block. A 2008 international treaty bans their use or
production under any circumstances because of the devastating effects on
civilians. **[Russia used a Uragan]{.underline}** -- which translates to
"Hurricane" -- **[rocket launcher system to fire cluster
bombs]{.underline}** in Kharkiv on March 24, killing eight civilians and
injuring 15 others, according to the U.N. human rights office and
Ukrainian officials. **[The Uragan is made by JSC Scientific and
Production Association Splav,]{.underline}** a Russian firm whose
systems have been sold abroad to countries including India. The company
has been sanctioned by the United States, but not by the UK or EU.
**[Its CEO, Alexander Smirnov, has escaped sanctions
altogether.]{.underline}** Splav and Smirnov did not respond to requests
for comment. It's much the same for Splav's parent company, NPK
Techmash. The United States and the EU have sanctioned the firm, but the
UK has not. Techmash CEO Alexander Kochkin has not been targeted by
American or European authorities. Techmash and Kochkin did not respond
to requests for comment. In a June 10 statement, the European Commission
said there is an effort to align sanctions lists "as much as legally
possible" among allies to achieve "the maximum cumulative effect of the
sanctions with all our like-minded partners." In cases where the lists
do not align, the Commission statement said, people and companies not
currently on the EU's sanctions list could be added later if there is
sufficient evidence. \"Nothing is off the table,\" the statement said.
WESTERN CONNECTIONS One of [the highest-profile Russian
firms]{.underline} [to escape]{.underline} Western [sanctions
is]{.underline} [**VSMPO-Avisma
Corp**[(VSMO.MM)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/VSMO.MM),]{.underline}
**[which is the world's largest titanium supplier]{.underline}** and 25%
owned by Rostec. **[It supplies Russia's defense
industry]{.underline}**, but also counts major Western aerospace
companies among its clients. Based in Verkhnyaya Salda, in central
Russia, VSMPO-Avisma has subsidiaries with facilities in the United
States, Switzerland and the UK, as well as sales and distribution staff
in the United States, Europe and Asia, according to its website and
annual reports. That's no doubt a factor that has allowed the company to
escape punishment, according to three sanctions and Russian defense
experts who spoke with Reuters. VSMPO-Avisma's vice chairman and
majority shareholder, Russian billionaire Mikhail Shelkov, ranked by
Forbes this year as Russia's 59th-richest person, likewise has not been
sanctioned. According to past press releases, VSMPO-Avisma has long-term
contracts to supply titanium to United Aircraft Corp, a Rostec
subsidiary that oversees production of Russian fighter jets such as the
Su-34 that have been shot down in Ukraine. United Aircraft has been
sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK. VSMPO-Avisma also sells to
Europe's Airbus[(AIR.PA)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AIR.PA), and
it supplied U.S. aerospace behemoth Boeing
Co[(BA.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/BA.N) up until March, when
the Arlington, Virginia-based company said it stopped purchasing
titanium from Russia. Boeing had announced just months earlier, in
November 2021, that VSMPO-Avisma would be its largest titanium supplier
"for current and future Boeing commercial airplanes." VSMPO-Avisma and
shareholder Shelkov declined to comment. Boeing said in a statement that
it has worked since 2014 to diversify its sources of titanium around the
world, and that its current inventory and sources \"provide sufficient
supply for airplane production.\" Airbus did not answer specific
questions about its relationship with VSMPO-Avisma. But in an emailed
statement it said potential sanctions on Russian titanium "would
massively damage the entire aerospace industry in Europe" while doing
little to harm Russia because those sales are but a small portion of
that nation\'s overall exports. In 2020, foreign sales accounted for
about two-thirds of VSMPO-Avisma's \$1.25 billion in revenue, according
to the company's most recent annual report. That puts Western officials
in a tough spot, said Richard Connolly, director of Eastern Advisory
Group, a UK consultancy that advises governments and businesses on the
Russian economy and its defense industry. Slapping sanctions on
VSMPO-Avisma would curtail its lucrative export trade, but it would also
force major players in global aviation to switch suppliers or risk
sanctions themselves. "That's the classic sanctions conundrum: If you
want to hurt somebody, you're going to hurt yourself," Connolly said

**[U.S. and British officials believe]{.underline}** that damaging
**[international sanctions slapped on Russia]{.underline}** over its
full-scale invasion of Ukraine **[are hampering its ability to restock
high-tech weapons]{.underline}**, **[such as precision-guided
munitions]{.underline}**, though Russia still has plenty of conventional
ammunition stocks at its disposal to continue to wage war. **[The impact
of Russia's sanctions-induced high-tech military
shortages]{.underline}** **[have been spotted by Western
governments]{.underline}**, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has
ordered troops into the besieged steel factory in the city of Mariupol,
Ukraine, while **[Russian pilots have rained down "dumb bombs" without
advanced precision guidance kits]{.underline}** into the city. The
**[Russian military burned through much of its stockpile of advanced
weapons in the early days of the war]{.underline}**; the United States
believes Russia may have fired as many as 12 hypersonic missiles into
Ukraine. **[U.S.-led [export

announced in late February **[sought to starve Russia of computer chips
and semiconductors]{.underline}** that could be used in advanced
military equipment. "**[Our sanctions and export controls]{.underline}**
were designed to **[deny Russia the critical inputs it needs to continue
the war]{.underline}** against Ukraine **[and to degrade its ability to
project power in the future]{.underline}**," said Wally Adeyemo, deputy
secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department. "**[We have disrupted the
Russian military supply chain and overall production]{.underline}**,
inhibited its defense sector from settling payments,
**[and]{.underline}** **[will continue to target Russia's ability to
restock, resupply, and rebuild]{.underline}**." Since late February,
when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government has
designated 147 entities, 35 individuals, and 74 vessels operating in
Russia's defense sector, according to data from the Treasury Department.
Among the top targets of U.S. sanctions is the Tactical Missiles
Corporation, known as KTRV when transliterated and abbreviated. KTRV is
a Russian state-owned defense conglomerate that produces hypersonic
weapons and technology used in radar systems and other multipurpose
missiles. The Treasury Department has sanctioned a chief executive of
KTRV, Boris Obnosov, as well as 28 subsidiaries of the conglomerate.
Within Russia, there are already signs the sanctions are starting to cut
into the country's ability to restock its high-end systems. U.S.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Congress on Wednesday that
Ukrainian officials had told her that Russia was being forced to take
semiconductors from dishwashers and refrigerators for high-tech weapons.
Raimondo said U.S. technology exports to Russia had dropped by almost 70
percent since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Moscow set up an
interdepartmental committee to sort out how to source more military
equipment domestically and if so-called friendly countries---including
China---might be willing to work around sanctions to provide
microelectronic processors and ammunition, two of Russia's biggest
military needs. "We do believe that the **[sanctions and the export
controls]{.underline}**, particularly [when it comes to components,
electronic components]{.underline}, **[has had an effect on the Russian
defense industrial base and their ability to restart]{.underline}**
\[**[precision-guided munitions\]]{.underline}**," a senior U.S. defense
official told reporters this week. "It's definitely beginning to bite
into his defense industrial capabilities." A British Foreign,
Commonwealth, and Development Office spokesperson told Foreign Policy
that international sanctions had frozen 60 percent of Russia's foreign
currency reserves, nearly \$340 billion. Up to 70,000 computer
specialists left Russia in March, and another 100,000 were expected to.
"Persistent sanctions will lead to depressed long-term GDP growth as the
country is unable to access key Western technology," the spokesperson
said in an emailed statement. (Russian GDP could fall by up to 15
percent this year.) It's difficult to track the exact extent that
sanctions are hitting Russia's ability to rearm; Western officials speak
about the matter in broad terms but have not publicly offered specific
numbers due the sensitivity of the information. "We cannot publicly
comment on the specific impact that these measures are having on the
production of particular weapons systems or munitions Russia is using to
prosecute its war against Ukraine," a State Department spokesperson
said. The bite of Western sanctions seems to have forced Moscow to begin
dusting off Soviet-era defense stocks and use munitions that are less
accurate---and thus potentially deadlier to Ukrainian civilians caught
in the crossfire of Russia's clumsy military offensives. On Monday, the
British defense ministry's intelligence arm assessed that the depletion
of Russia's precision-guided stockpiles has "forced the use of readily
available but aging munitions that are less reliable, less accurate, and
more easily intercepted." The 77-day invasion has "revealed
shortcomings" in Russia's ability to conduct precision strikes,
including subjecting Ukraine's towns and villages to intense shelling, a
trend that seems to be on the rise in the offensive in the Donbas
region. Even if such ammunition is inferior to precision-guided
munitions, Russia has plenty of it to continue its military offensives.
"They will face problems on the security of supply on their
precision-guided missiles, some other high-tech elements, and weaponry,"
said one senior Eastern European defense official. "But at the same
time, **[we shouldn't discount their ability to wage war with simpler
stuff]{.underline}**. **[They have]{.underline}** enough
\[**[ammunition]{.underline}**\] for years and years **[for fighting on
that level]{.underline}** they're doing," the official added. Much of
Russia's defense industrial base has been under harsh U.S. sanctions
since 2014, during Russia's first invasion of Ukraine and illegal
annexation of Crimea. In late March, the Biden administration also
slapped
[sanctions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/24/fact-sheet-united-states-and-allies-and-partners-impose-additional-costs-on-russia/#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20United%20States%20is,with%20the%20EU%20and%20G7.)
on dozens of Russian defense companies beyond KTRV, including High
Precision Systems, which produces surface-to-air missiles such as the
Iskander and anti-tank missile systems, and Tekhmash, the producer of
many of the Russian military's ammunition, multiple rocket systems, and
unguided bombs. The Treasury Department has also targeted neighboring
Belarus's defense sector with its own sanctions packages. Belarusian
President Aleksandr Lukashenko, which has aligned his authoritarian
government with Moscow, supported the invasion and allowed Russian
troops to use his country to launch offensives and airstrikes across the
border into northern Ukraine in the early weeks of the war, before
Russia's effort to capture Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, failed. **[The U.S.
Commerce Department rolled out new export control restrictions aimed at
stopping Russia from getting U.S.-made technology]{.underline}** that
could be used in military hardware, even if that technology is supplied
by third countries. **[This includes microelectronics,
telecommunications, information security equipment, sensors, navigation
equipment, avionics, and parts for civilian aircraft.]{.underline}** But
much of the U.S. effort to stop Russia's military supply lines from
humming relies on extensive export controls that lean on the newly made
Foreign Direct Product Rule to block almost any products made with U.S.
software or technology. The problem with depending on that rule, former
officials told Foreign Policy, is that it leans heavily on foreign
countries to make enforcement calls. And the United States has
limited---if any---visibility on products that are actually reaching
Russia. "My huge, huge concern is that we do not have end use checks in
Russia," said Nazak Nikakhtar, a former assistant secretary of commerce
during the Trump administration and now a partner at Wiley Rein, a law
firm. "We do not have U.S. officials that can go to the Russian entities
to figure out even if there's an export license that has been granted.
We have nobody to go in there and do an audit to see that that's
happened." There's another potential end-around, Nikakhtar said: China.
The U.S. rival could help supply critical minerals needed to make steel
and aluminum for military equipment as well as microchips needed to help
guide precision missiles to their targets. But even if Russia is able to
find other suppliers for military components, as some expect, it is
likely to face an increasingly steep economic cliff as the invasion of
Ukraine continues. Speaking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday,
British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said Western sanctions would pose
a "real challenge" to Russia's ability to refurbish his "worn out" armed
forces. And even though the Kremlin has managed to stabilize the ruble
with energy exports, it is not likely to be able to stave off the
financial pain for long. "Russia is probably spending almost everything
it's earning on its energy exports to prop up the ruble and, you know,
do all sorts of other B.S. to make it seem like the economy is okay when
it's not," said Brian O'Toole, a nonresident senior fellow with the
Atlantic Council think tank and a former Treasury Department official.
"They're making hard choices now," he added. "It's frustrating for folks
not to see all of the results, but this is unsustainable for the
Russians. At some point, they're just going to fall off a cliff."

**[With rising frictions between the United States and

**[technology]{.underline}**, **[few]{.underline}** may still
**[remember]{.underline}** **[the great accomplishments achieved when
the United States and China cooperated]{.underline}**
**[in]{.underline}** the field of **[technology]{.underline}** over the
past 40 years. During the rapprochement in the 1970s, cooperation in
technology spanned over fields like energy, health, basic research in
physics and chemistry, and civil industrial technology, among others
that could easily be considered sensitive areas by current standards.
Academic exchanges also thrived: the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology has hosted thousands of Chinese scientists
since the 1980s. The U.S. National Science Foundation also [sent U.S.
scholars](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/st-fact-sheet.pdf)
to conduct scientific research in China. Yet in recent years, **[this
collaborative ethos has been increasingly replaced by
mistrust]{.underline}**. The U.S. [urged its
allies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-23/u-s-urges-key-allies-to-avoid-using-huawei-equipment-wsj-says)
to stop purchasing 5G infrastructure and equipment from China's
technology crown jewel, Huawei. Renowned scholars were
[sanctioned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-28/harvard-university-professor-accused-of-lying-about-china-ties)
for involvement in technological research sponsored by the other
nation's government. **[Some people may view the deterioration of the
U.S.-China technology exchange simply as a trade-off between national
security and innovation.]{.underline}** However, **[the contesting
philosophies of technological protectionism and globalism is the more
fundamental issue at play]{.underline}**. This paper discusses the past,
present, and future of US-China technology cooperation in three
dimensions. 1.) Why has technological cooperation deteriorated? 2.) How
is reviving cooperation beneficial to both countries? 3.) Is it possible
to restore trust against the backdrop of U.S.-China competition? Why has
U.S.-China cooperation in technology deteriorated? The reasons for
deterioration lie in the rapid development of technology in both
countries. On the one hand, China's technological capacity has been
advancing rapidly. Harvard Economics Professor Richard Freeman
[accredited China
with](https://economics.harvard.edu/files/economics/files/bigger_than_you_thought_chinas_contribution_journal_china_and_world_economy_xie-freeman_jan2019.pdf)
36 percent of global scientific articles in 2016 and 37 percent of
citations to scientific articles in 2013, which is two times more than
China's share of global population or GDP. The time to turn research
into commercial applications has also shortened. In November 2019, China
had already
[launched](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/tech/5g-china/index.html) 5G
services in 50 cities. The companies that run 5G services are none other
but China's three state-run telecom giants\--China Mobile, China
Telecom, and China Unicom\--reinforcing the United States' concerns that
Chinese government is closely involved in China's cutting-edge
technologies. On the other hand, technology has also developed by leaps
and bounds in the United States. In the past, only a few high-stake,
dual-use technologies would spark national security concerns. In
addition, these technologies often had military applications. Yet as
technological applications proliferated and interfaced pervasively with
people's everyday lives, even dating applications can now collect
personal data that warrants regulators' concerns. Increasingly, the
United States finds itself vulnerable in many new technological fields
that were not formerly considered sensitive. Most fundamentally,
U.S.-China technology cooperation has shifted from unilateral to
bilateral. In the past, the U.S. was typically the provider of capital
and technological know-how while China was the receiver. For the United
States, technological assistance to China was partly an exercise in
[science
diplomacy](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Trends%20in%20US-China%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Cooperation.pdf).
Since the U.S. surpassed China in technological capacity by a wide
margin, exchanging technology assets for diplomatic objectives made
political sense for the United States. Moreover, in the past, U.S.-China
technological cooperation was often rolled out in formal settings.
Cooperation usually took place between government agencies or
government-affiliated research institutions, which enabled the U.S. to
control the extent of the technological knowledge that was transferred
to China. In recent years, however, China has started exporting capital
and talent to the United States as well. Chinese technology giants
Alibaba and Baidu established Artificial Intelligence research labs in
California, where they collaborated with U.S. scholars and institutions.
Chinese companies poured capital into U.S. technology companies. In the
first quarter of 2014 alone, Chinese investors struck [high-tech
deals](https://asiasociety.org/files/China_Hi_Tech_Report.pdf) worth
over six billion dollars, including the takeovers of Motorola Mobility
and IBM's x86 server unit. With the rise of Chinese talent and capital,
the exchange of technological know-how between the United States and
China now takes place among private businesses and between individuals:
an exchange that is impossible for the United States to fully control.
The changing nature of technological cooperation has made both countries
reconsider the political costs and benefits. Meanwhile, as nationalist
sentiments rise on a global scale, technology has become a convenient
medium to strike a political point. Hence, it comes as no surprise that
backlash against U.S.-China technological cooperation gradually comes to
the mainstream. Technological protectionism has temporarily prevailed
against technological globalism. Why is reviving technological
cooperation beneficial to both United States and China? **[The United
States and China should not let technological protectionism
persist]{.underline}**, **[as cooperation has proven valuable to both
sides]{.underline}**. [These benefits are evident whether cooperation is
organized through **government-sponsored programs** or through **private
companies and individuals**.]{.underline} Th**[e [U.S.-China Clean
Energy Research
Center](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/04/f34/1_Zhou%2C%20Nan_CERC%20Overview.pdf)
(CERC) is a quintessential example of the value of technology
cooperation through government-sponsored programs]{.underline}**.
Initiated at the presidential level in 2009, CERC aims to achieve a
large-scale adoption of energy efficient buildings backed up by
cutting-edge technologies. **[Through the collective effort of and
researchers in the United States and China]{.underline}**, **[CERC has
launched high-tech products]{.underline}** including daylight
redirecting windows, trilogy integrated heat pumps and co-axial ground
heat exchangers that are reported to consume 14 to 30 percent less
energy than conventional products. In addition, **[CERC also published
multiple copyrighted software applications]{.underline}** and are on the
path to file joint intellectual properties on behalf of research teams
from both countries. **[CERC is just one example]{.underline}** **[of
the vast potential that U.S.-China cooperation]{.underline}** **[can
unleash]{.underline}**, especially in fields that concern both
countries. As acknowledged in a [U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission
report](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Trends%20in%20US-China%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Cooperation.pdf),
the U.S. gained research access to important facilities in China and
communicated with China's leading scientists through various scientific
initiatives. Needless to say, **[China also obtained a great amount of
technological experience and know-how by collaborating with the United
States]{.underline}**. The two countries have only more to gain when
their technology cooperation is carried out on a business-to-business or
individual-to-individual level. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
[estimates](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/stem-crisis-or-stem-surplus-yes-and-yes.htm)
a need for approximately one million more Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) professionals than the U.S.
currently produces to retain its own preeminence in technology. And over
the years, **[China has consistently been the leading source of STEM
students enrolled in the United States]{.underline}**. Moreover, surveys
of U.S. National Science Foundation [shows
that](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11347) **[90
percent of Chinese scholars still work in the U.S.]{.underline}** ten
years after receiving their doctoral degrees in STEM. **[These scholars
power innovation]{.underline}** in Silicon Valley, **[expediting the
creation of technological applications that benefit millions of people
in the United States]{.underline}**. **[The benefit of cooperating with
the United States on a business-to-business or individual-to-individual
level is also obvious for China]{.underline}**. For instance, through
**[joint ventures]{.underline}**, **[medical companies]{.underline}**
**[in the United States have brought innovative treatments to China's

diseases like influenza, diabetes, and hypertension. How do we restore
trust in technology cooperation against the backdrop of U.S.-China
competition? **[Restoring U.S.-China technological cooperation will
benefit the people of both countries]{.underline}**. As the U.S.-China
relationship is currently characterized by tension and mistrust, leaders
in each country need to firmly express their determination to restore
cooperation with their counterpart. They must co-develop strategic
solutions to achieve this shared goal. First, **[the U.S. and China need
to identify common interests,]{.underline}** search for shared problems,
and capitalize on existing relationships in those areas. For example, as
Professor Lan Xue at Tsinghua University and Denis Simon at Arizona
State University
[suggested](https://www.chinausfocus.com/2022/wp-content/uploads/Part-02-Chapter-122.pdf),
the Integrated Gas-steam Combined Cycle field could be a potential
opportunity to expand ties between the two countries. In this field,
China appears to have the strongest technology in coal-gas
transformation, while the United States ranks first in the world in
steam turbine technology. The two countries could share their
technological advantages to achieve a win-win outcome. Second, the U.S.
and China need to enhance bilateral agreements that address pressing
issues like intellectual property protection. Such agreements should
contain clear protocols that guide the handling of sensitive data,
specify the process of transferring technical knowledge, and establish
corresponding auditing procedures. In addition, **[each country needs to
do its part to address the other party's core concerns]{.underline}**.
As scholars from the Asia Society
[recommended](https://asiasociety.org/files/China_Hi_Tech_Report.pdf),
China has to further unleash its private sector and give businesses more
freedom to make investment decisions that are unconstrained by the
government. If China is willing to take bold steps to empower its
private enterprises, the United States will be less concerned about the
politicization of Chinese investments. Meanwhile, U.S. regulators should
evaluate foreign investments in technology sectors based on the
investors' compliance history rather than their nationality. While all
the aforementioned suggestions are by no means easy to achieve, each
small step in the right direction can go a long way to make
technological exchanges between the United States and China more
transparent and open. **[History reveals that technological
protectionism and globalism often take turns to dominate the mainstream
political narrative]{.underline}**. While neither is categorically
better than the other, most would agree with that rapid innovations
needs a certain level of collaboration to sprout. **[As the world awaits
the two great powers to bring more technology advancement to mankind, it
behooves the United States and China to continue close
cooperation]{.underline}**.

BEIJING --- **[As Chinese authorities prepare to build up]{.underline}**
their country **[in the next several years]{.underline}**, **[they're
keen to ensure the rest of the world will still do business with
them]{.underline}**. In a high-level press conference Friday, **[central
government officials emphasized]{.underline}** **[the need for other
countries to collaborate with China]{.underline}**, amid rising global
uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic and protectionism. The media
event comes as China's top leadership conclude an important policy
meeting aimed at setting the country's economic and social priorities
for the next five years. **[The officials particularly pushed back
against "decoupling," or a complete separation of the U.S. and Chinese
economies]{.underline}** that President Donald Trump's administration
has advocated, beginning **[with technology]{.underline}**. Chinese
telecommunications giant [Huawei has been severely
hampered](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/huawei-q3-smartphone-shipments-plunge-as-us-sanctions-continue-to-bite.html)
by U.S. restrictions in the last two years. "[Decoupling is basically
not realistic, and there's no benefit for China or the
U.S]{.underline}., or the entire world," said Han Wenxiu, deputy
director at the Office of the Central Commission for Financial and
Economic Affairs. That's according to a CNBC translation of his
Mandarin-language remarks. "[Those who want decoupling are
few]{.underline}. **[Those who want collaboration are far
more]{.underline}**," Han said, noting that the U**[.S. and China are
only able to be the world's two largest economies since they complement
each other and operate in an open global environment]{.underline}**.
President Xi is bracing for a 'combative' period ahead with China's
five-year plan The U.S. is China's largest trade partner, but the two
countries have been locked in tensions for more than two years. Each
government has levied tariffs on goods worth hundreds of billions of
dollars from the other country. Critics say the dominance of the state
in China's economy gives it unfair advantages over American companies
and other foreign businesses. Economists expect China to become the
world's largest economy in the next few years, surpassing the U.S. In an
effort to reduce economic dependency on debt-fueled investment and
manufacturing of goods for export, China has been trying to increase its
reliance on domestic consumption. Foreign trade still accounts for about
30% of China's gross domestic product, according to Han, who noted a
decline from 60% previously. "Looking ahead, China's imports and
exports, use of foreign capital, and scale of investment overseas will
expand, and international status will rise," he said. "This is also an
important characteristic of a large country's economy." 'Self-reliance'
in technology Han and four other central government officials were
speaking a day after the [release of preliminary
details](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-10/30/c_139476984.htm) on
a [plan for economic development from 2021 to
2025,](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/26/china-to-reveal-its-five-year-fyp-growth-strategy-in-xi-jinping-era.html)
also known as the 14th Five-Year Plan. This week's meeting of the
central committee of China's ruling Communist Party also addressed goals
for the year 2035. The meeting emphasized China's need to pursue
"self-reliance" in technology as a strategy for national development,
according to [state
media.](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-10/29/c_1126674147.htm)
The country has been accelerating its own development of critical
technologies such as semiconductors and a [navigation system to rival
the U.S. Global-Positioning System
(GPS).](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/22/beidou-china-aims-to-complete-gps-system-that-rivals-us.html)
Again, while describing China's need to pursue a new phase of
development, officials were quick to point out how the country needed to
learn from international expertise. "China's technological innovation
has never been closed innovation, and in the future it will not close
its doors to innovate on its own," Science and Technology Minister Wang
Zhigang said during Friday's press conference, according to a CNBC
translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. Aim to build a 'modern'
society In the release about goals for 2035, China's leaders said they
would focus on building a "modern socialist China" that includes
modernization of national defense and the military. The emphasis on
"modern" comes after the ruling party said Thursday it will basically
achieve its promise of building a "[moderately prosperous
society"](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1079510.shtml) by next
year, when the Chinese Communist Party celebrates its 100th anniversary.
The release also said that Beijing expects GDP to top 100 trillion yuan
(about \$14.9 trillion) this year, which would imply an increase of at
least 0.9% from 2019′s level. Longer term, authorities said China aims
to become "a strong country in culture, education, talent, sports and
health."

#### Buying from domestic producers creates a stockpile and solves dependency AND Japan and Australia can lead the way 

**Hui**, B.A, **'21** (Mary, B.A in Spanish and Portugese from Princeton
university, a reporter based in Hong Kong. She previously worked at New
York Times, Washington Post, and CityLab. published April 23, 2021,

"Japan's global rare earths quest holds lessons for the US and Europe",
<https://qz.com/1998773/japans-rare-earths-strategy-has-lessons-for-us-europe/>)//lexmw

As the US and Europe seek to secure their rare earths supply chains and
limit reliance on China, Japan's model may offer some guidance. One key
difference is that while Japan is scarce in mineral resources[, the **US
and Europe have sizable rare earth reserves**.]{.underline} The problem,
in the case of the US, is that it ceded its mining and processing
capabilities to China over the past decades, and must now rebuild the
industry at a time when [China is already deeply
embedded](https://qz.com/1971108/chinese-rare-earths-giant-shenghe-is-building-global-alliances/)
in global rare earth supply chains. ["**Japan and Australia have
definitely led** the way **in terms of how the US government should
approach**]{.underline} \[securing rare earths supplies\]," but it's
"not necessarily a cut-and-paste" job for Washington in terms of
emulating specific policies, said Pini Althaus, CEO of USA Rare Earth,
which is developing a mine in Texas and establishing a domestic
processing facility in Colorado. It is [expecting to go
public](https://qz.com/1969069/the-us-takes-steps-to-break-chinas-rare-earths-monopoly/)
in a New York listing this year. For example, [**the US could** use
existing federal legislation to **build up its national defense
stockpile of rare earths** **by** committing to **buying rare earths
from domestic producers** over a certain number of years, and within a
certain price band]{.underline}, explained Dan McGroarty, advisory board
member of USA Rare Earth. That would, in effect, be an offtake agreement
much like those of Jogmec with various rare earths producers. And the US
government, [by committing to buying from a particular domestic
producer, would send a strong signal to capital markets]{.underline},
said McGroarty. This would also avoid "picking winners and losers,"
which direct federal grants to specific companies would entail, possibly
at the expense of driving private capital away from other firms. Experts
also caution that rare earth mines only represent the upstream part of
the supply chain concerned with getting the ores out of the ground.
Processing those ores into high-purity rare earth metals, then using
them to manufacture magnets and batteries, is just as crucial. "A
hundred new mines can open around the world with generous public
support, but [**without investing** in value-added processing and
manufacturing, **the rest of the world will** continue to **remain
dependent on China** for refined rare earths and rare earth-bearing
technologies]{.underline}," said Julie Klinger, assistant professor in
geography at the University of Delaware.

By 2017, it was obvious that in the showdown between Molycorp and China,
the Chinese had won. Mountain Pass was now sending U.S.-mined rare earth
concentrate to China for processing. The dream of a one-stop American
rare earths solution was over, and the private sector had little
appetite for reviving it. [The history of Molycorp is littered with
"what ifs." What if the Pentagon's mid-2010s industrial policy
determined that rare earths were critical to national security, like it
does now]{.underline}? And, most importantly, [what if American
customers, including those in the U.S. government, had decided that
diversifying their rare earth supplies with an American source had been
worthwhile?]{.underline} Recently there have been stirrings of interest
in repatriating rare earth production to the United States. [**The U.S.
military has become** acutely **aware of its [dependence on
China](https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/2018/05/02/americas-critical-minerals-problem-has-gone-from-bad-to-worse/),**
**due** in part **to belligerent Chinese threats to cut rare earth
exports**. American companies, too, are realizing how dependent they are
on this single supplier]{.underline}, a country that is becoming more
expensive to work with as trade tensions rise. However, [those in the
private sector know all too well how difficult it is for companies to
take proactive supply chain steps.]{.underline} Therefore, [i**t is the
government's responsibility to set the stage for increased American rare
earth productio**n.]{.underline} There are a number of steps the U.S.
government can take to establish a more certain future for domestic rare
earth production. Reducing red tape and bureaucratic inertia will lower
costs and reduce risk --- there is no reason that permitting a mine in
the United States should take five times longer than it does in Canada
or Australia. [The **government** **can** also **protect the market,**
at little cost, **from Chinese manipulation by agreeing to purchase rare
earths from American producers** when such materials are intended for
military systems.]{.underline} Instead of funding substitution
technologies to reduce demand for rare earths, the U.S. should invest in
production technologies to increase its supply.

[**To meet growing REE demands**, future **U.S. policies should aim at**
locating and **tapping into other** promising **REE reserves in the
nation** so that Mountain Pass Mine no longer constitutes the entirety
of domestic REE mining.]{.underline} The United States Geological Survey
has recently entered a joint venture with the respective geological
survey functions of Australia and Canada in pooling data and best
practices, called the Critical Minerals Mapping Initiative (USGS 2020).
All three nations have vast tracts of land with potentially tremendous
reserves of critical minerals, and an accurate understanding of the
distribution and concentration of these reserves should precede any 10
major prospecting and development of mining facilities. The Round Top
Mountain in Texas, Bear Lodge Range in Wyoming, and the Bokan-Dotson
Ridge in Alaska have all been identified as promising deposits of REEs
in the United States, and projects to develop and exploit these sites
are underway (Borzykowski 2019; Goyal 2020). The former is expected to
begin commercial production of refined REE in 2021. Deep sea mining for
polymetallic nodules with exploitable concentrations of REE may be
considered if its drastic environmental ramifications can be justified
for value of REEs extractable[. **Sustainable development implementation
of best practices may be encouraged with** a combination of **government
funding** and environmental regulations, e.g. by putting these mines
under pilot programs in joint venture with the Department of Energy.
Regulations may further ensure that ores mined from these mines are
refined in the U.S. and fed into the domestic supply chain as opposed to
being refined overseas]{.underline}. Policies regarding domestic mining
and refining should keep in mind that, while multiple REEs are found in
the same deposit, the most critical REEs are the few that are
extensively used in permanent magnets---notably Nd and Dy. Relative
concentrations of these elements could certainly be an important
criterion in future mapping and prospecting of deposits. [**Future
government funding and incentivization may encourage the priority
purification of elements that are in high demand**. For example, the
Wheat Ridge refining facility was funded by the U.S. Department of
Defense and the latter will determine the specific elements to be
purified, ostensibly those that are essential to the defense enterprise
(Stutt 2020).]{.underline}

#### Government investment would provide certainty to investors and spills over to expand REE private investment

https://www.bu.edu/gdp/files/2018/02/Klinger-2018-Rare-Earth-Elements_Development-Policy-and-Sustainability-Issues.pdf)//lexmw

The rude awakening precipitated by the 2010 crisis stimulated an
unprecedented wave of interest in the supply chains and life cycles of
rare earth elements. Some examined these dynamics out of concern for the
environmental and health impacts of rare earth mining and processing
(Klinger, 2015a; Pagano et al., 2015; Sprecher et al., 2014; Carpenter
et al., 2015; Weng et al., 2013). Others focused on mitigating the risks
of future supply disruptions (Keilhacker and Minner, 2017; Stegen, 2015;
Mancheri, 2015), and still others capitalized on the moment to develop
proposals to "green" the rare earth supply chain (Rauer and Kaufmann,
2014). [**Despite a number of feasible proposals to improve** the
**sustainability** of the rare earths lifecycle (McLellan et al., 2014),
**there remains a** considerable **gap** between theory and practice,
**due to policy and market failures.** **Governments thus far have
failed to provide sufficient certainty to support investments in
environmentally sound rare earth production, while** **major downstream
buyers have opted not to purchase more sustainably produced rare earth
elements.** Because rare earth elements are critical to life as we know
it, they present rich and as yet, largely untapped, potential for
fertile social science research]{.underline}. Beyond policy analysis and
supply chain concerns, the integration of these elements into everyday
life in ever more intimate and mundane ways requires further analysis.

#### Revitalizing domestic supply is key to reducing dependency

U.S. policies for the time being should accept that Chinese supplies
will remain the most lucrative option for most industries, and punitive
policies to discourage their use would not be advisable. Both **[the
U.S.]{.underline}** and other countries, [**through stockpiling** **of**
key **REEs** **at** both **governmental and corporate levels**, **should
ensure** that **domestic industries are** relatively **unimpacted by**
future **fluctuations** **in** **the REE market** for a reasonable
period of a year or more]{.underline}. [In the long run, **incentivizing
the use of American REE supplies should be considered**, both **to
reduce dependency on Chinese supplies** and to help vitalize the
domestic REE market.]{.underline}

required supporting documentation for payment, [[the door is wide open
to fraud, theft and improper payments]{.mark}.]{.underline} · Without
established and documented surveillance measures for ONA service
contracts, the Office of Net Assessment may not have received all
services outlined in contractor statements of work. · At this point, the
next finding is no surprise: [the [ONA]{.mark} [didn't administer
contracts in accordance with federal]{.mark}, Defense Department and

of the ONA, "We review all deliverables to ensure they're consistent
with the statement of work. We evaluate each deliverable to assess
whether we should seek additional information or require a resubmission
of commissioned work." Based on the available evidence, his statement is
false. Here's the bottom line: [the [ONA has no clue what they're

hypersonic missiles that can travel the globe. If this unit isn't doing
the job they're supposed to do, why are we still funding it? It'd be
better to take their 20 million dollar budget and give it our service
members. At least we know they've earned it. A government slush fund
will always be a government slush fund unless the Congress steps up and

[In 2022 the world faces a new nuclear threat, with the risk that
Russian President Vladimir Putin's [invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} [could
turn into a wider war]{.mark} between NATO and Moscow [that escalates
past the nuclear threshold or]{.mark}, alternatively, Russia's use of
[a]{.mark} [[tactical]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon](https://dc.medill.northwestern.edu/blog/2018/02/09/exactly-low-yield-nuclear-weapon/#sthash.NpMxbirP.dpbs)
in Ukraine.]{.underline} CIA Director William Burns
[said](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-nuclear-weapons-burns-cia/31804539.html)
on 14 April: '[[Given]{.mark} [the]{.mark} potential
[desperation]{.mark} of President Putin and the Russian leadership,
given [the setbacks]{.mark} that they've faced so far, militarily, [none
of us can take lightly the threat]{.mark} posed [by a]{.mark}
[potential]{.mark} resort to tactical [nuc]{.mark}lear weapons or
low-yield nuclear weapons.' [A Russian]{.mark} [defeat at the
conventional]{.mark} military [level]{.mark} [would]{.mark} [increase
the likelihood of Putin going nuclear]{.mark}, perhaps as part of a
[strategy](https://thebulletin.org/2022/03/russian-military-doctrine-calls-a-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation-heres-why/)
of 'escalate to de-escalate' in which a low-yield tactical nuclear
weapon is detonated [in Ukraine]{.mark}. Such a move would either seek
to turn the tide of battle or serve as a warning shot to Kyiv and NATO
to accept Russia's terms for ending the war.]{.underline} It's also
possible that Russia could decide to escalate at a conventional level by
extending its attacks beyond Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov [has
accused](https://www.reuters.com/world/response-lavrov-comments-us-says-talk-nuclear-escalation-is-irresponsible-2022-04-26/)
NATO of engaging in a proxy war and said that weapons shipments are
legitimate targets. And [Russia is already making implied threats of
[extending the
war](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/26/moldova-ukraine-war-putin-russia/)
to the disputed Transnistria region of
[Moldova](https://olgalautman.substack.com/p/russia-sets-their-eye-on-moldova?r=k8nwv&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).]{.underline}
[That would dramatically increase the threat to Romania, a NATO member,
and destabilise the Moldovan state, many of whose residents are
ethnically Romanian. Perhaps most worryingly,]{.underline} **[[Putin
recently doubled down on the nuclear rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}**
with an [implicit
threat](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Ukraine-war/Ukraine-war-Free-to-read/Ukraine-from-April-12-to-April-28-Putin-warns-West-of-lightning-fast-retaliation):
If someone intends to intervene in the ongoing events from the outside
and create strategic threats for Russia that are unacceptable to us,
they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast. We
have all the tools for this, things no one else can boast of having now.
And we will not boast---[**[we will use them if necessary]{.mark}**. And
I want everyone to know that.]{.underline} With the West expanding its
assistance to Ukraine, the possibility that Putin could interpret it as
intervention generates another pathway to escalation. [[It's not clear
how NATO would respond to]{.mark} the use of [a]{.mark} low-yield
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon in Ukraine---[or]{.mark}, for that matter,
large-scale use of [chemical weapons]{.mark} against Ukrainian targets.
The [chemical weapons]{.mark} scenario [is]{.mark} perhaps more
[likely]{.mark}, [given that norms]{.mark} [of non-use]{.mark} of
chemical weapons [have already been eroded by Syria]{.mark}'s
large-scale use of a range of them against its own people in
2014.]{.underline} Use of such weapons by Russia might simply attract
intensified sanctions and political condemnation. [Tactical nuclear use
would be a different matter altogether. [Use of a nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon---even a low-yield tactical weapon---[would represent]{.mark}
**[a fundamental shift in global security]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[It
would shatter the norm of non-use]{.mark} of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, and absent an effective response by NATO, [would
usher in a new era in which [states would perceive such weapons as
credible options for warfighting]{.mark}, [not]{.mark} [just]{.mark} for
[deterrence]{.mark}. [Other]{.mark} nuclear-armed [states]{.mark}
[might]{.mark} move to [prioritise low-yield]{.mark} tactical
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}, [and non-nuclear states]{.mark} that
had nuclear ambitions, [such as Iran,]{.mark} [might decide that]{.mark}
participating in [non-prolif]{.mark}eration and arms control [is no
longer a priority]{.mark}]{.underline}. Negotiations on restoring the
nuclear deal with Iran could become a casualty of nuclear escalation in
Ukraine and North Korea is already well into
[developing](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/04/26/asia-pacific/north-korea-parade-kim-nuclear/)
a range of new tactical nuclear forces. Of course, not responding---or
responding weakly, such as with intensified economic sanctions and
political condemnation---isn't the only option open to NATO in the event
Russia uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine. Direct military
intervention at a conventional level, to strike at Russian
nuclear-capable delivery systems, would be one option; another would be
deployment of NATO forces on the ground to directly support Ukrainian
forces in battle. [But [any]{.mark} direct military
[intervention]{.mark} by NATO, even below the nuclear threshold,
[would]{.mark} almost [inevitably lead to a wider]{.mark} NATO--Russia
[war]{.mark}, and [with]{.mark} it, [the]{.mark} near [certainty]{.mark}
[of nuclear escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline} It's that spectre of
nuclear war---as opposed to a single detonation---that constrains NATO's
responses, even in the face of Russian atrocities in Bucha and
Kramatorsk. In particular, the prospect of such a war escalating to
strategic nuclear exchanges and devastating the planet will be in the
minds of NATO decisionmakers.

State news agency KCNA reported that Kim "gave important instructions on
further building up the defense capabilities and nuclear combat forces
of the country." "[North Koreans are really committed to shifting their
nuclear policy,]{.underline}" according to Lewis. He said the missile
looked like "yet another variant" of a short-range one and that it's
"more of the same" from North Korea --- but it's "still quite
unwelcome." According to Lewis, [North Korea is now working toward a
nuclear weapons test, more than four years since its last one in 2017.
"]{.underline}In a sense, [[the gloves are off]{.mark}," he said. "[They
don't]{.mark} really [feel bound by any of the commitments they

[North Korea closed the entrances to its nuclear test tunnels in 2018,

nuclear weapon, the professor said. "If we know one thing, we know that
there's going to be a nuclear test when Kim Jong Un feels like it," he
added.

Moreover, concluding this research, self-awareness related to

access by storing and recording transactions in the immutable ledger and
make data exchanges between distributed gadgets smooth and

[could help sat]{.mark}ellite [op]{.mark}erator[s]{.mark} [sleep]{.mark}
a little [easier.]{.mark}** [The]{.mark} prototype
[system]{.mark},]{.underline} [[developed]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ([NOAA]{.mark}), [is
designed to alert op]{.mark}erator[s]{.mark} [when their]{.mark}
space[craft]{.mark} [may be on a collision course]{.mark} with another
object.]{.underline} That\'s a real and growing concern, given how
[crowded Earth orbit is
becoming](https://www.space.com/space-junk-threat-satellites-guidelines-reduce-orbital-debris.html).
[The system,]{.underline} which was demonstrated in a [webcast press
conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAJE7VpOelo) on Feb. 11, [is
called the Open-Architecture Data Repository ([OADR]{.mark}).
[I]{.mark}t\'[s]{.mark} [a cloud database that keeps tabs]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} [the]{.mark} growing [population in
[Earth](https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html)
orbit and warns]{.mark} if there\'s a danger [of a collision]{.mark},
[just as you might get a weather warning]{.mark} if you\'re in the path
of a storm]{.underline}. It works like this: [The [OADR collects data on
space conditions from]{.mark} a number of different [scans from ground
sensors that together cover much of the globe]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[The OADR is linked]{.mark} both [to US]{.mark}-government-[affiliated
ground stations and to a]{.mark} network of [commercial
stations]{.mark}]{.underline} (especially in the Southern Hemisphere).
[The data also includes [space
weather](https://www.space.com/space-weather) observations and other
satellites\' live telemetry and maneuvering plans. [The OADR]{.mark}
takes in all that data and [creates a picture]{.mark} [of the orbital
environment]{.mark}, which [it]{.mark} then uses to [assess]{.mark} [if
there are any looming \"conjunctions]{.mark}\" --- close encounters
between orbiting objects. If there are any, the [OADR]{.mark} [can relay
that]{.mark} data back [to sat]{.mark}ellite [op]{.mark}erator[s]{.mark}
as a sort of weather forecast, [giving]{.mark}
[them]{.mark}]{.underline} (ideally) **[[several days to move]{.mark}
their satellite out of the way.]{.underline}** \"A hurricane
notification displays a probability cone that continually changes as new
data is obtained,\" Scott Leonard, Special Advisor to the Director of
NOAA\'s Office of Space Commerce, said in the Feb. 11 press conference.
\"A conjunction is similar.\" OADR is still under development; the newly
unveiled system is a prototype. According to Leonard, the OADR team
still needs to iron out some kinks with automating data collection and
prediction processes. [[If all goes according to plan, the OADR will see
initial public operation by 2024 and be **fully operational by
2025.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[There are already a number of commercial
firms providing these sorts of space-tracking
services,]{.underline}]{.mark} but the OADR\'s creators hope that it
will ultimately have more data than those services --- and better
predictive capabilities to boot. It\'s hardly a secret that Earth orbit
is getting quite crowded. There are already [at least 23,000
objects](https://www.space.com/space-junk-growing-problem-complicated-solution)
in space with a diameter of 4 inches (10 centimeters) or greater. That
number really began to explode in the 21st century, and it isn\'t
slowing down. "We expect on the order of 57,000 new satellites by the
year 2030,\" Stephen Volz, assistant secretary of commerce for
environmental observation at NOAA, said in the press conference. And
in-space collisions aren\'t just the stuff of nightmare fantasy. Last
year, for example, a [Chinese military satellite
collided](https://www.space.com/space-junk-collision-chinese-satellite-yunhai-1-02)
with a piece of a 25-year-old Russian rocket. The satellites of
SpaceX\'s Starlink broadband constellation, which may someday consist of
more than 40,000 spacecraft, seem to be [a particular cause for
alerts](https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellite-collision-alerts-on-the-rise).
In its stewards\' eyes, [the [OADR]{.mark} [is intended to preemptively
keep track of]{.mark} all the [biggest threats]{.mark}. But [it]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} likely [be some time before any system can keep track of
the ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[[millions of tiny
objects]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/Space_debris_by_the_numbers)
[in orbit --- [everything from rubbish to shards of metal to flecks of
paint]{.mark} --- all of which can cause catastrophic damage, given how
fast everything moves up there.]{.underline}

Protecting existing forests and planting new ones are surely good things
to do. However[, scientists say [**we must not place too much faith in
trees** to save us]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, last year one
research group claimed we can plant a trillion extra trees and [remove a
quarter of the carbon dioxide currently in the
air](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax0848). These figures have been
widely criticised as overhyped and unreliable. [[Trees will]{.mark}
definitely [help]{.mark} us slow climate change, [but they won't reverse
it]{.mark} on their own.]{.underline} [[The]{.mark} underlying
[problem]{.mark} [is that our society is releasing]{.mark}
[g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}ase[s]{.mark}, especially carbon
dioxide (CO2), that are warming the Earth's climate]{.underline} to
levels we have never experienced before. As a result the great ice
sheets are melting, contributing to rising seas, and extreme weather
events like hurricanes and droughts are becoming more severe. [[The
solution is to **stop emitting**]{.mark} **all greenhouse
gases,**]{.underline} for instance by replacing fossil fuels with
renewable energy sources like solar power. Deforestation is actually one
of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide, because when trees are cut
down much of the carbon stored within them escapes into the air --
especially if the wood is burned. For instance, in 2017 land use changes
-- mostly deforestation -- contributed [four billion tonnes of
CO2](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2152929-bad-news-carbon-emissions-have-suddenly-started-rising-again/)
emissions to [the global total of 41 billion tonnes of
CO2](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-2141-2018). In other words, if we
stopped cutting down trees we would cut our annual emissions by about
10%.

By some estimates, trees can be an enormous carbon sink. [[A

[Once those trees had
matured](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48870920), they
could store 752 billion tonnes of CO2. Planting trees, the team wrote,
is "[one of the most effective carbon drawdown solutions to
date](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax0848)". This finding has had
immediate, fierce pushback from other climate scientists. [In October
2019, the journal [Science]{.mark} [published
[four](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz0388)
[highly](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aay8060)
[critical](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aay7976)
[comments](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aay8334)]{.mark}. These
argued that [the researchers had overestimated the carbon trees could
store]{.mark} -- **[by a factor of five]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They
also highlighted multiple mistakes. For instance, [[much of the
land]{.mark} Crowther described as "available" for tree planting
[already has plants]{.mark} growing on it, [all of them storing

Seneviratne](https://iac.ethz.ch/people-iac/person-detail.html?persid=54778)

correction**](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abc8905)]{.mark}, in which
[they admitted that]{.mark} some of [their]{.mark} headline [claims were

**[first]{.underline}** **[step]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** the
**[military CBMs was the establishment of a hotline]{.underline}**
**[between the militaries]{.underline}** in 1971 following the model of
the United States' and USSR\'s military communications in the same
timeframe ([Ahmar
2001](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222),
87). However, **[the hotline]{.underline}** between the Director
Generals of Military Operations of both countries **[remained
symbolic]{.underline}**, **[and no practical advantages were effectively
achieved for maintaining peaceful relations]{.underline}**. The
**[hotline works well during peacetime]{.underline}** **[while it gets
suspended during crises build-ups, rendering it, in essence,
useless]{.underline}**. The sitting prime ministers of both countries,
Benazir Bhutto and Rajiv Gandhi, signed the next major CBM under the
umbrella of the Nuclear Threat Initiatives. **[This CBM aimed to prevent
attacks]{.underline}** **[on each other\'s nuclear
facilities]{.underline}** **[but does not provide any prevention against
foreign allies attacking such installations]{.underline}**. This measure
enabled the exchange of a list of nuclear facilities between both the
countries in 1992 (Shahid-ur-Rehman Khan
[1992](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222))
which helped to build trust and both the nuclear rivals respected the
arrangements during the peace as well as during times of increased
crisis. In 1991, Pakistan and India\'s CBMs progressed further as they
signed an agreement for prior notification regarding military exercises
and air space violations, especially near the LoC. This set of CBMs
opened further channels of communication in the military and diplomatic
domains to avoid the repetition of earlier crises but it could not
achieve the desired results owing to the non-availability of
implementation structures. The next CBM milestone was the 1992 agreement
on the complete prohibition of chemical weapons---both countries
declared that they do not possess any chemical weapons. However, these
CBMs suffered a considerable setback once India declared its chemical
weapons arsenal under the Chemical Weapons Convention ([Nuclear Threat
Initiative
2011a](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
Such incidents created further suspicion between both countries---which
were already having problematic relations---and halted the advancement
in the process of confidence building. Pakistan considered the incident
as a violation of the bilateral agreement which widened the gulf in
trust deficit between the two countries. In the wake of this incident,
no further progress was achieved until 1999. Later, Nawaz Sharif and
Vajpayee concluded the Lahore Accord in 1999, which was a milestone
agreement for peacebuilding following the nuclear tests in 1998. This
agreement incorporated the concept of developing and employing CBMs in
both the conventional military and nuclear domains to avoid any untoward
nuclear weapons launch situations and to reduce the prospects for future
conflicts ([Nuclear Threat Initiative
2011b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
Unfortunately, this set of CBMs was undermined by the Kargil Conflict,
which started a few months after the declaration. This time it was the
Pakistani side that undermined the peace efforts as political and
military leaderships were not on the same page. Here the political
leadership tried to put some mechanisms in place for peaceful
coexistence, but the military institution spoiled these efforts. This
problem necessitates the requirement of structures that can implement
and sustain CBMs without significant interference from any state
institution, military in particular. From 1999 to 2003, tensions
remained high between both the states due to large-scale deployments
along the LoC, plus terrorist attacks in Srinagar and on the Indian
parliament. The UN General Assembly session of 2003 carved out a route
toward a ceasefire and later on to direct negotiations between the
political leadership of both countries ([Khawaja
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222),
120--121). A new set of military and nuclear CBMs was then worked upon
which included the reduction of troops along the LoC, no further
development of military posts, and prior information regarding the
testing of ballistic missiles ([Krepon
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
The composite dialogue process constituted a major step forward which
aimed to resolve the issues between both countries through a strategy
that satisfies the demands of both countries ([Padder
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
This dialogue process provided the opportunity to discuss the peace
process through a diverse range of domains including the Kashmir issue.
However, all these CBMs halted in 2008 ([Gul
2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222))
after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai for which India blamed Pakistan.
Later, very few efforts were initiated in 2014 and 2015, but those did
not work due to pre-existing notions of trust deficit and further
accusations of terrorist attacks. [The primary issues in the
implementation of the military and nuclear CBMs]{.underline} **[are the
non-availability of a framework, transparency issues, and lack of
trust]{.underline}**. [Political aspects will also play a significant
role in the success of any military and nuclear CBMs]{.underline},
**[yet military and security concerns continue to undermine political
will]{.underline}** between these two states. While Pakistan and India
are so-called democratic countries, they do not have liberal democratic
structures and the separation of powers remains a contentious issue.
Additionally, [the policies adopted through CBMs]{.underline} **[proved
to be thoroughly incompatible]{.underline}** with follow-up actions
because the military and political leadership in both countries remained
suspicious of each other. **[These issues obstructed the implementation
of military and nuclear CBMs in both letter and spirit]{.underline}**.
The recurring crises between Pakistan and India after the Pulwama
attacks of 2019 highlight the shortfalls of the concept of nuclear
deterrence between both South Asian neighbors. Cyberspace also provides
a new domain for waging wars and there are no existing agreements
between Pakistan and India in this domain. A cyber-attack may prove
disastrous in provoking an unintentional war in the region ([Yamin
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).

## AT: Russian Sanctions

#### Sanctions fail -- They hurt the people NOT the military or leaders

Rami Al-Khalifa Al-Ali 6-5-22 Writer for Saudi Gazette \[The failure of
Western sanctions against Russia,
<https://www.zawya.com/en/world/uk-and-europe/the-failure-of-western-sanctions-against-russia-gycrd12k>\]
//DHS WAgustin

[Historically]{.underline}, **[sanctions have failed to achieve any
political goals]{.underline}**. **[It is the worst weapon]{.underline}**
that the modern and contemporary **[international system has
produced]{.underline}**. **[Every time when sanctions were
imposed]{.underline}**, **[it was the people who paid the
price]{.underline}**, **[while these sanctions failed to harm the
leaders and officials in the targeted countries.]{.underline}** With the
beginning of the Russian war on Ukraine, a series of Western sanctions
are being slapped on the Russian side, and that has covered almost all
fields. This is up to the extent that one of the Western universities
canceled a lecture on Tolstoy on the pretext that he was a Russian! [The
Western nations wished that their sanctions would be so crushing and
thus deal a fatal blow to the Russian economy, **and hence they have
frozen Russian deposits as well as Russian assets abroad, leaving no
room for the Western hand to reach unless it was punished.** The worst
scenario was the]{.underline} **[attempt to isolate Russia from the
global banking payment system called SWIFT]{.underline}** (The Society
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) **[as this makes
import and export a very complicated affair even though it would be
possible]{.underline}**. **[The Russian economy absorbed the first
blow]{.underline}**, despite the sagging ruble, but it **[quickly
recovered]{.underline}**, **[and even achieved higher gains than before
the war.]{.underline}** The obvious question that must be asked by
Western circles: what is the purpose of these sanctions? The answer, as
presented by Western politicians, is twofold: the first is the weakening
of the Russian economy, which affects the stability of the Putin
government and undermines confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin
on the Russian street. However, **[the results of these sanctions were
counterproductive and the proportion of opponents of the war is very
small on the Russian street]{.underline}**, [and President Putin's
popularity is on the rise]{.underline}. [The second aspect is the effect
on the Russian war machine]{.underline}. [It is true that there were
many difficulties experienced by the Russian forces]{.underline},
especially in the beginning of the war, and the failure to capture Kiev,
and this forced the Russian leadership to change its military plans.
**[But this has nothing to do with the Western sanctions]{.underline}**.
Rather, the armed forces, like **[the Russian economy, have regained
their solidity and seemed more capable of achieving breakthroughs and
steady military progress]{.underline}**. This does not mean victory in
the war, but it means that the **[Russian forces were not affected by
the aforesaid sanctions. The Western sanctions on Russia made the supply
of Ukrainian grain a very difficult issue]{.underline}**, even if it was
done in relatively small quantities, and **[Russia\'s isolation from the
SWIFT regime made the supply of Russian grain no less
difficult.]{.underline}** If we know that both countries export 30
percent of the grain worldwide, it can be understood that the food
crisis that the world is beginning to suffer from, and which threatens
impending famines that might afflict a large number of the third world
countries, even though these countries have no part in the Ukrainian war
or in the conflict between the West and Russia. The worst is that the
[European societies themselves have begun to suffer from the rise in the
prices of essential goods,]{.underline} as the prices of fuels increased
by up to 40 percent, and this led to a rise in most essential goods,
especially foodstuffs. After the experience of the past months, **[the
Western sanctions on Russia are like those who shoot themselves in the
feet.]{.underline}** In fact, **[Moscow has benefited from sanctions on
the energy]{.underline}** **[sector]{.underline}**. What it was unable
to export was compensated by the rise in oil prices. It is clear that
the West must change its strategy, and this can only be done by bitterly
admitting that it has failed miserably in its policy of imposing
sanctions against Russia.

// DHS WAgustin 🍞

Fifty years ago this week, former U.S. President Richard Nixon flew to
China, setting the stage for a dramatic shift in relations between the
two countries. Much has changed since that visit, not always for the
better. Despite a flurry of diplomatic activity over the past year,
U.S.-China ties remain tense. Discussions in
[Alaska](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56452471) and
[Tianjin](https://www.state.gov/deputy-secretary-shermans-visit-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)
yielded few, if any, breakthroughs. While friendlier in tone, the recent
summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden
led only to
[agreements](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/17/xi-biden-summit-us-china-policy/)
to hold yet more talks, albeit on important issues such as strategic
stability. The lone bilateral bright spot has been some cooperation on
[climate](https://www.state.gov/u-s-china-joint-glasgow-declaration-on-enhancing-climate-action-in-the-2020s/).
Since the summit, the [Biden]{.underline} [administration
[announced](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062016949/president-biden-announces-a-diplomatic-boycott-of-the-being-winter-olympics)

more Chinese companies to its trade restriction list while Congress
passed a
[bill](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-passes-bill-targeting-china-over-uyghur-forced-labor-n1286160)
aimed at countering China's forced labor abuses in Xinjiang. **[The two
sides' antagonistic stances on issues related to]{.underline}**
security, economics**[, technology,]{.underline}** and ideology **[have
largely crystalized, leaving little space for the adjustments that could
relieve simmering tensions.]{.underline}** Below, Paul Haenle and Sam
Bresnick analyze how the two countries got here and how they can move
forward. WHY ARE THE TWO SIDES STUCK? Former U.S. President Donald Trump
ushered in a more confrontational era in U.S.-China relations, and Biden
has largely maintained his predecessor's approach to Beijing, albeit
with a more equanimous tone and embrace of multilateralism. The [U.S.
government has for decades been concerned by China's
mercantilism]{.underline}, rapid military modernization, and illiberal
approach to human rights, but it had held out hope that China might
liberalize through increasingly robust contact with the rest of the
world. That has not happened, and the United States and others have lost
patience with China's state capitalist system, militarization of the
South China Sea, and increasingly [authoritarian
governance](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law.html).
But Beijing is not backing down. Despite facing pronounced international
pushback during the pandemic, Xi has become even more confident in
China's economic system, governance model, and approach to international
affairs. "Time and momentum are on China's side," he
[argued](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3117314/xi-jinping-says-time-and-momentum-chinas-side-he-sets-out)
last year at a high-level meeting, though many analysts accuse the party
of
[overconfidence](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-From-leader-to-students-overconfidence-clouds-China).
At the same time, Chinese officials are increasingly looking askance at
their U.S. counterparts. Many appear to believe that the United States,
though still a formidable power, is in the early stages of an
[inevitable
decline](https://www.economist.com/china/2021/03/31/china-is-betting-that-the-west-is-in-irreversible-decline).
Just as China resumes its rightful place atop the hierarchy of Asian
nations, Beijing's thinking goes, the United States' unresolved racial
justice issues, income inequality, and political polarization will
catalyze an irreversible diminution of U.S. power in Asia and across the
globe. Complicating matters further, the **[U.S. and
Chinese]{.underline}** **[publics]{.underline}** **[are increasingly
distrustful of each other.]{.underline}** A whopping 89 percent of
American respondents to a recent
[survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/)
from the Pew Research Center consider China a competitor or enemy, while
around [two-thirds](https://uscnpm.org/the-pulse/) of Chinese
respondents view the United States unfavorably or very unfavorably. Such
negative mutual perceptions would likely hamper each side's ability to
recalibrate its approach to the other. Finally, **[the two sides'
divergent framings of the relationship are contributing to the ongoing
[stalemate](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202107/t20210726_9134602.html)]{.underline}**.
Discussions with high-level Chinese scholars and former government
officials have revealed that Beijing prefers to define the bilateral
relationship as a peaceful coexistence guided by shared principles,
consensus, and possible cooperation. **[China is frustrated that the
United States is more focused on competing with and confronting
Beijing]{.underline}**. In Washington, however, great power rivalry,
defined more by competition and confrontation than cooperation, has
become the central framework for bilateral ties. HOW HAVE THESE
DIFFERING VIEWS AFFECTED POLICYMAKING? The pronounced turn in U.S.
policy toward China, beginning with the Trump administration, has not
led to self-reflection on the part of Beijing. Chinese scholars and
experts initially appeared somewhat
[surprised](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/asia/china-trade-war-trump.html)
that many of the economic, security, and technology policies that
Beijing has pursued for years have recently precipitated robust policy
responses from the United States. The ruling party believes that it is
merely continuing down the same path it established some years back,
which has led to its attributing the downturn in the bilateral
relationship solely to the United States. **[Chinese government
officials appear to believe the United States' goal is to
"[suppress](https://news.cgtn.com/news/3245444e77554464776c6d636a4e6e62684a4856/index.html)"
China's rise.]{.underline}** They

the Trump administration's
[policies](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202101/1213441.shtml), as
well as Biden's [AUKUS submarine
pact](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3151700/aukus-alliance-what-it-what-does-it-have-do-china-and-why)
and the Quad's [increasing
coordination](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/11/975469203/quad-summit-biden-looks-to-boost-coordination-against-china),
as evidence of Washington's desire to
[contain](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202201/1246562.shtml) China
and limit Beijing's influence in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, **[many
Chinese scholars and experts view U.S. restrictions on sensitive
technology exports to China as
[proof](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3164367/china-must-brace-digital-cold-war-us-battle-tech-supremacy)
that the United States seeks to hamper its burgeoning tech
sector.]{.underline}** Finally, they
[see](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1220502.shtml)U.S.
complaints about human rights violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and
Tibet as disingenuous, given the United States' own problems with racial
justice and homelessness, as well as its high levels of wealth and
income inequality. In short, China sees the United States as a declining
power that is attempting to keep a rising China from overtaking it. The
United States, as expected, has a very different view of bilateral
dynamics. Washington blames the downturn in relations on China's
increasing assertiveness abroad and repressiveness at home. U.S.
officials are concerned that China, through its support of authoritarian
regimes, is chipping away at the liberal international order and trying
to create "[a world safe for
autocracy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-06-11/world-safe-autocracy)";
that its continued military modernization and interest in building bases
in
[Cambodia](https://amti.csis.org/changes-underway-at-cambodias-ream-naval-base/),
[Equatorial
Guinea](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-seeks-first-military-base-on-africas-atlantic-coast-u-s-intelligence-finds-11638726327),
and the [United Arab
Emirates](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=dubai+chinese+military+bas)
will allow Beijing to challenge Washington's security primacy; and that
its state capitalist, mercantilist system threatens the rules-based
economic order. Beijing's incarceration of around [1 million Uighurs and
other Muslim
minorities](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-repression-uyghurs-xinjiang)
in Xinjiang, increasingly strict online censorship, and prosecution of
dissidents have further fueled Washington's desire to enact more
aggressive responses. WHAT DOES EACH SIDE WANT OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP?
Our conversations have revealed that China wants the United States to
afford it the space it believes it deserves as a rising power, at least
in its own backyard. Beijing, as the preeminent Asian security and
economic actor, sees the United States' military presence in East and
Southeast Asia as inherently threatening. Moreover, it hopes that
Washington will ease pressure, especially regarding economics and
technology, as well as refrain from engaging in ideological competition
in service of impugning Beijing's governance model and human rights
record. But perhaps China's most significant wish is for the United
States to acknowledge the legitimacy of its economic and political
systems. Given that the United States views China's economic and
political practices as antithetical to its own, as well as to those of
countries acting within a healthy, properly functioning international
system, Washington is unlikely to refrain from impeaching Chinese
authoritarianism, mercantilism, and treatment of ethnic minorities and
dissidents. The United States' tougher policies and more confrontational
approach are meant to push back on and defend against a range of Chinese
domestic and foreign practices that threaten to undermine the
international rules and norms that have been in place since the end of
World War II, as well as raise the costs for China to revise that very
order. In general, Washington would prefer that Beijing dial back or
eliminate its economic and innovation mercantilism, respect other
countries' sovereignties, agree to peacefully resolve disputes, and
abide by international agreements on human rights. HOW CAN THE TWO SIDES
RECONCILE THEIR DIFFERENCES? Biden has opted to use a calmer, more
restrained tone with Beijing than did his predecessor, with the aim of
avoiding escalation. Moreover, unlike some Trump administration
[officials](https://www.wsj.com/articles/secretary-of-state-pompeo-to-urge-chinese-people-to-change-the-communist-party-11595517729),
Biden's team has made it clear that Washington is not seeking regime
change in China. And though Biden
[criticized](https://www.cfr.org/election2020/candidate-tracker) Trump's
lack of a clear set of goals or a coherent interagency policy framework
for addressing the China challenge, his administration has yet to
release its long-awaited [China
strategy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-01-14/washingtons-missing-china-strategy)
(though China does figure prominently in its recently issued
[Indo-Pacific
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/U.S.-Indo-Pacific-Strategy.pdf)).
Until that document is issued, the finer points of the administration's
plans to compete with Beijing, as well as the end goal of such
competition, will remain fuzzy. A clear articulation of U.S. aims would
be helpful in Washington's efforts to secure greater international
cooperation from allies and partners in addressing the challenges China
poses. It would also provide Chinese and U.S. leaders a starting point
from which to negotiate the future of bilateral ties. In China, there is
considerable room for greater self-reflection. Chinese leaders should
closely examine how Beijing's own aggressive diplomacy, economic
statecraft, military buildup, and human rights violations have alarmed
and unsettled the United States and many other countries, especially
those in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Across many conversations,
few, if any, Chinese experts have acknowledged that Beijing's actions
have played a role in the cratering of U.S.-China relations.
Furthermore, they are reluctant to acknowledge that numerous nations'
hardening stances toward China are driven by China's activities rather
than U.S. coercion. Acknowledging its agency in harming relations, as
well as its ability to take proactive steps to put U.S.-China ties on
better footing, would constitute important initial gestures by the
Chinese side. Moreover, China's willingness to take more responsibility
for its own actions and modify its policy and rhetoric would go a long
way toward stabilizing bilateral dynamics. There is no doubt the
U.S.-China relationship will remain competitive going forward.
Preventing bilateral ties from becoming even more hostile and
adversarial, however, should constitute a common aim for both countries.
Biden understands this, as he stressed the importance of developing
guardrails and establishing strategic stability talks between the two
governments [during his virtual
summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/readout-of-president-bidens-virtual-meeting-with-president-xi-jinping-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)
with Xi. Implementing robust crisis management mechanisms would also
prove a useful step in augmenting both nations' abilities to control
escalation in the event of a military incident in the increasingly
crowded waters and air space off of China's eastern and southern coasts.
Washington and Beijing also should establish an effective
problem-solving mode for the bilateral relationship. Many observers
stress the importance of U.S.-China cooperation on transnational issues
where the two sides have common interests---[climate
change](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2021/10/28/rebuilding-us-chinese-cooperation-on-climate-change-the-science-and-technology-opportunity/),
[nuclear
nonproliferation](https://www.brookings.edu/research/revitalizing-nonproliferation-cooperation-with-russia-and-china/),
and [global
health](https://www.csis.org/analysis/advancing-us-china-health-security-cooperation-era-strategic-competition),
among others. These efforts are certainly important, but they are quite
ambitious and often hampered by Washington's and Beijing's different
approaches to managing international issues. The two countries have thus
far failed to make progress in most areas. That does not mean they
should abandon these efforts. But perhaps the United States and China
should devote more energy toward trying to create a problem-solving
approach for addressing more pointed irritants, such as limits on
journalist visas and consulate closures. Such a method has already
yielded dividends regarding the [former
issue](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/us/politics/us-china-journalists.html).
The two countries should focus on how to build on those smaller
successes to work through larger problems in other areas. By committing
to this pragmatic approach, the United States and China may be able to
find a way to put a floor under deteriorating relations, begin to build
goodwill, and lay the foundation for taking on the larger structural
issues in areas, like trade and technology, that will be key to
determining the future health and welfare of the U.S.-China relationship
over the long term. Despite the two nations' differing mindsets and
approaches to bilateral ties, starting small could prove the best method
through which to, eventually, realize large gains.

### 2AC -- Doesn't Deter Russia

#### Sanctions don't deter russia -- status quo proves

Abigail **Ng 22** \[Abigail Ng, 3-11-22, "Relying on sanctions to stop
Russia could go 'terribly wrong,' says Niall Ferguson," CNBC,

The strategy of sitting back and waiting for Russia's war machine to
grind to a halt because of sanctions could go "terribly wrong,"
according to Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution
at Stanford University.

"It's a highly risky strategy," he said.

The Ukrainian resistance cannot hold the fort for much longer, and
sanctions by the West won't be able to stop Russia in time, he told
CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Friday.

He said the U.S. is relying heavily on sanctions and "very belated arms
deliveries" to Ukraine, but he's concerned that those fighting for
Ukraine won't be able to defend the country for long.

Though the Russians have sustained more casualties than expected, they
are still "advancing steadily," he said.

"The assumption that this is going to drag out, that the United States
can sit back and watch the economic sanctions do their work may be
gravely mistaken," Ferguson said.

Anna Ohanyan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP)
echoed that sentiment.

"While the sanctions will start biting --- perhaps can change Putin's
behavior down the road --- at this point, they cannot be relied on as an
instrument to be used to stop the violence," said Ohanyan, a nonresident
senior scholar in CEIP's Russia and Eurasia program.

"It won't work fast enough to avert a Russian victory in Ukraine and I
think this is the critical problem," Ferguson said.

'Nightmare scenario'

The U.S. and its allies have imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Russia
for its invasion of Ukraine. But it appears that there's a race between
Russia's military advancements and the sanctions that are crippling
Moscow.

"There's no guarantee that Ukraine holds out, and what I dread is
steadily worse news from Ukraine, and the breakdown of Ukraine's
defenses," Ferguson said.

"We'll sit there saying, oh, well the sanctions have really hurt Russia
--- but it won't matter to Putin because he will be able to claim
victory. That for me is the nightmare scenario," he added.

Ferguson said the U.S. should help support Ukraine's defenses without
escalating it into a full-blown NATO-Russia war.

Arms deliveries to Ukraine slowed down previously, and now there is a
"frantic effort" to help Ukraine keep up the fight, he said.

That, however, may create the conditions of a proxy war, CEIP's Ohanyan
said.

"It appears that unfortunately, \[at\] this point, sanctions and the
military assistance work at cross purposes," she said.

## AT: BWC CP

### Solvency Deficits

#### There are too many problems with the BWC for it to solve -- funding, cooperation, and more are issues that it is dealing with right now

Kathryn **Millett**., 06-01-**17**, \"Financial Woes Spell Trouble for
the Biological Weapons Convention,\" Health Security,

[Strong stewardship is critical to the enduring health and strength of
international disarmament treaties and the norms they
uphold]{.underline}. Such stewardship involves significant investment of
both political will and financial capital. [Currently, the Biological
and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC)---a cornerstone of the web of
international efforts to ensure and protect global health
security---seems to have neither, and the ramifications are
significant.]{.underline} In November 2016, states parties to the BWC
gathered together for the 5-year review of the operation of the
convention. Such review conferences are opportunities to assess the
health of the treaty and take decisions and recommendations to further
strengthen its effectiveness and improve its implementation. Key issues
requiring urgent action by states parties in 2016 included the
modalities of cooperation and assistance efforts in responding to
deliberate disease events, enhanced reassurance on treaty compliance,
and a regular scientific and technological review process to ensure the
treaty keeps pace with the rapid developments in the life sciences.
[Despite considerable preparatory effort by states parties, the review
conference failed to reach consensus on any substantive issues or agree
an intersessional work program. The sole outcome of over a year\'s hard
work was agreement that the treaty would continue to function as before,
while a Meeting of States Parties (MSP) would be held in December 2017
that would "seek to make progress on issues of substance and process for
the period before the next Review Conference, with a view to reaching
consensus on an intersessional process."]{.underline} While the majority
of attention focused on efforts to reach consensus on substantive
issues---and the continuing disappointment of the failure to do
so---another issue rumbled largely ignored in the background. Just prior
to the review conference---and for the first time in the treaty\'s
history---the BWC Implementation Support Unit (ISU) distributed a
document prepared by the Financial Resources Management Service (FRMS)
of the United Nations Office at Geneva detailing the status of states
parties\' financial contributions to the convention. This document
demonstrated that 62% of states parties owed a combined total of
US\$596,519 to the treaty over the period 2001 to 2016 in unpaid
assessed contributions. Concurrently, a number of presentations by the
UN FRMS made during the review conference explicitly spelled out the
consequences to states parties of the roll-out of the UN enterprise
resource planning system, dubbed "Umoja": under UN financial procedures,
funds must be available before staff contracts can be renewed and
meetings held; if there are insufficient funds, meetings cannot be
convened and staff cannot be recruited or have their contracts renewed.
Umoja does not permit crossing budget lines to make up shortfalls in
other areas. In the run-up to a meeting, a review process will take
place where a go/no-go decision will be taken 3 months ahead of the
proposed meeting dates based on funding. While the implementation of the
financial rules are causing havoc across a number of disarmament
treaties (eg, the 5th Review Conference of the Convention on Certain
Conventional Weapons \[CCW\] was almost brought to a screeching halt in
2016, and all remaining scheduled meetings for 2017 are facing
cancellation), these rules possess a greater significance for the BWC
ISU than other similar treaty support agencies: Since the ISU is merely
hosted by the UN and is not itself a UN body, it cannot draw on the
regular budget of the UN and is thus dependent solely on the annual
assessed contributions of its states parties. The ISU\'s financial
instability is further compounded by the fact that its current funding
arrangements do not permit recruitment of temporary staff to cover gaps
in the ISU due to maternity leave or illness. Amid this new focus on
finances came an extraordinary move from the BWC depository states (the
Russian Federation, the United States, and the United Kingdom). In March
2017, the BWC depository states called on all states parties to pay
their assessed financial contributions to the treaty and settle their
arrears "without further delay," warning that failure to do so could
result in staff losses in the BWC ISU and cancellation of the
forthcoming meeting of states parties in December. While a number of
states responded rapidly to this urgent call and consequently enabled
renewal of ISU staff contracts, as of the latest FRMS report of April
31, 2017, there remains --\$473,195 in outstanding contributions shared
by 114 (or 64% of) states parties covering the years 2001 to 2017. While
a significant proportion of arrears reflects late payments of assessed
contributions for the year 2017 (--\$141,195), 4 states have not paid
their assessed contributions since 2001 and another 8 have not paid any
contributions over the past 5 years. One state party alone owns 63% of
all debts owed to the BWC, accrued over the period 2001 to 2017.
[Conversely, several states have overpaid the BWC, the most notable
among them being the United States\'s overpayment of around a quarter of
a million dollars. However, the BWC still possesses a deficit of
--\$114,344: not enough to cover the meeting costs for
2017.]{.underline} With the planned 2017 meeting of states parties being
the sole forum for making any progress on agreement of a substantive
intersessional work program prior to the next review conference
scheduled for 2021, it is of the utmost importance that states parties
dig deep and make sure that there are sufficient funds to allow the
meeting to be held. [Of equal importance are measures to ensure
financial sustainability of the convention and the ISU. There are a
number of financial solutions that have been adopted by similar treaties
and agencies that could be adapted to suit the needs of the
BWC]{.underline}. For example, the Organisation for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW) maintains a working capital fund that it uses to
cover temporary financial shortcomings, while the International Atomic
Energy Agency\'s (IAEA) Peaceful Uses Initiative solicits extrabudgetary
contributions that supplement its other funds when the need arises. Both
funds ensure that the agencies possess the financial flexibility to
quickly respond to financial shortages, requests for additional
activities by states parties, and any unexpected needs or unforeseen
emergency events. Another option would be to consider the establishment
of a voluntary revolving capital fund as adopted in January 2015 by the
United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR). UNIDIR\'s
"stability fund" has a \$1 million goal for which 1-time donations are
received from participating states on a rotating annual basis, ensuring
that the fund is replenished each year. [Extrabudgetary funding for the
BWC is not new. The ISU has often received voluntary contributions from
states parties in a position to do so, but these contributions are
usually given on a project-by-project basis to fund the convening of a
certain meeting or similar activity. The most significant of these
contributions is from the European Council, which has supported the BWC
through the adoption of 2 council decisions and which provides financial
contributions to UNODA for activities in support of the
BWC,]{.underline} including costs for 2 UNODA staff to carry out
activities mandated by the decisions. Further, the BWC administers a
sponsorship program funded by voluntary contributions from states that
enable participants from developing countries to attend BWC meetings.
The creation of a voluntary and non-earmarked fund that the ISU could
employ as needed to cover any shortfalls in meeting and staffing costs
would provide the BWC with the flexibility needed to cover urgent costs
that cannot be achieved under Umoja rules. Further, by channeling
overpayments by states parties into a central reserve, the ongoing
unpaid arrears of recalcitrant states would no longer be masked by any
overpayments and more pressure could be brought to bear on them to
resolve their debts in a timely fashion. But any such monies would need
to be held outside the Umoja system, which may not be possible. The
above options could also be supported by the adoption of sanctions
against states in arrears that would deny voting or participatory rights
to states until their debts are settled or an appropriate reduction in
arrears has been effected. Such a system has long been in use by the UN.
Under Article 19 of the Charter, a UN member state in arrears of an
amount that equals or exceeds the contributions due for 2 preceding
years can lose its vote in the general assembly. An exception is
permitted if the member state can show that conditions beyond its
control contributed to its inability to pay. As recently as May 2, 2017,
the UN invoked Article 19 to withdraw Libya\'s voting rights in the
general assembly until such time as it has made the necessary payments
to reduce its arrears below the specified amount. The OPCW has the
option to invoke a similar procedure under rule 35 of the rules of
procedure of the executive council. [However, financial woes are not the
only issue to plague the BWC. States parties have consistently shown a
lack of the necessary political will to strengthen the BWC.
Participation in BWC meetings has historically been low when compared
with other disarmament treaties, and states have regularly failed to
overcome political differences and point-scoring to agree on necessary
measures to strengthen implementation of the treaty. In fact, the
planned 2017 MSP has yet to appoint a chair, meaning that critical
preparations and discussions prior to the meeting cannot be
undertaken.]{.underline} Measures instigated by states parties such as
the cooperation and assistance database remain woefully under-used by
both states offering assistance and those seeking assistance, and the
request from the Seventh Review Conference in 2011 for "States Parties
to provide at least biannually appropriate information on how they
implement Article X of the Convention to the ISU" saw submissions from
just 10 states parties, 1 regional organization, and 1 group of states
during the intersessional period of 2012 to 2015. Perhaps the most
obvious evidence of a general lack of political will or interest in the
BWC can be found in the level of annual confidence-building measures
(CBM) returns. Despite a number of programs and efforts to enhance
participation, the number of confidence-building measures returns per
year has never risen above 45% of states parties. In fact, a third of
states parties have never submitted a return, and, when returns are
submitted, the quality of the information provided is often sorely
lacking. This is particularly significant in the BWC context as the
confidence-building measures represent the sole means by which states
parties more formally provide reassurance of compliance with the
provisions and obligations of the BWC. All across the disarmament
sphere[, treaties are under financial pressure. The continued use and
threats of use of conventional and nonconventional weapons by states and
non-state actors puts international weapons norms at risk.]{.underline}
States parties must act to positively reinforce the norms against the
use of banned weapons. Upholding the life-saving norms enshrined in
international disarmament treaties is a difficult and costly
business---one that requires considerable political commitment and
financial investment. [When states fail to invest in ensuring that
treaties remain strong and well-resourced, it is humanity that
ultimately pays the price. If BWC states parties truly value the norms
against the use of biology as a weapon, they need to demonstrate this by
putting their money where their mouth is.]{.underline}

In 1990, the U.S. political and military leadership was significantly
challenged by the possibility that Iraq, having the fourth largest
offensive chemical and biological weapons program in the world at the
time, might use those unconventional weapons against U.S. forces and its
allies massing in Saudi Arabia. For all practical purposes, there was no
real capability to rapidly detect and identify the deliberate release of
anthrax spores or other biological weapons, and the U.S. military did
not have sufficient vaccines or therapeutics for such an event. Due to
this severe neglect to biological defense, former Secretary of State
James Baker gave a formal letter to the Iraqi foreign minister stating
that Iraq would "pay a terrible price" if it used chemical or biological
weapons against the U.S.-led coalition.1 Had Saddam Hussein decided to
use biological weapons, it could have caused thousands of casualties.
Fortunately for U.S. forces, he did not have a significant biological
weapons capability and there was no use of those weapons. Despite dark
predictions of both nation-states and violent extremist organizations
planning biological attacks against the nation, there has been no test
of the U.S. military's biodefense capability. A "biological taboo"
resulting from decades of arms control discussions has held, despite the
lack of a verification regime behind the Biological Weapons Convention
(BWC).2 Concerns about Iraq's biological weapons capability in 2003
evaporated a year later, with nothing substantive to find. Despite
concerns about a domestic terrorist biological incident following the
anthrax attacks in 2001, there has never been a mass casualty attack
caused by biological organisms in the United States since then. [The
Nation's recent public health challenges in addressing the 2019
coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) have caused questions as to whether the
U.S. military is sufficiently prepared for an **adversary that might be
emboldened to use biological weapons against U.S. national security
interests**.]{.underline} Despite the lack of any biological attacks or
even threat of attacks over the past twenty years, [the potential impact
of a large-scale use of a contagious disease concerns enough people to
call for new national strategies and improved response capabilities for
biological threats.]{.underline} Current strategies aim to mitigate
natural disease, to regulate biological research associated with the
more hazardous biological diseases, and to improve the U.S. public
health system to better respond to biological threats.3 Yet despite the
development of four national strategies for national biodefense over the
past twenty years, the U.S. government has not significantly advanced
its capabilities for protecting against and responding to biological
threats, defined as including natural diseases, deliberate biological
releases, and laboratory accidents[. Despite the high-level attention to
this threat, assessments of the Nation's capability to prepare for
deliberate biological threats have **not, however, been
positive**.]{.underline} [Unclassified assessments from the State
Department and the Department of Defense (DOD) suggest **that China and
Russia** could have a **biological weapons** capability, as could North
Korea and Iran.]{.underline}4 The lack of any actual use of biological
weapons against the United States has perhaps diminished the concern
that potential weaknesses exist. [In the event of a future conflict with
great powers, there is the chance that biological warfare could emerge
as a significant threat, perhaps in a form unrecognized from Cold War
experiences.]{.underline} Prior to attempting the implementation of yet
another strategy to counter biological threats[, the Army needs to
establish the context of how adversaries would deliberately use
biological threats against U.S. national security interests. Once a
rational appreciation of the threat is developed, one can then create a
defense strategy that directly addresses deliberate biological releases.
Importantly, such a strategy needs to be resourced and implemented to
address the future challenges of a deliberate biological release,
understanding that natural infectious diseases pose a competing
priority.]{.underline} Counter to the hypothesis that the pandemic
outbreak has revealed potential vulnerabilities to biological weapons,
COVID-19 has not in fact acted like a biological weapon. As a result,
the lessons that apply from this contemporary crisis toward a biological
weapons attack are few. A pandemic outbreak, affecting the general
population over a year's time, requires a different approach than
military forces protecting themselves from a focused deliberate
biological attack. COVID-19 is not lethal enough and does not
incapacitate people quickly enough to qualify as a potential weapon,
despite the more than 750,000 deaths caused over twenty-four months
across the United States.5 A biological disease that does not
significantly impact young, healthy people and that is easily countered
by a national vaccine program is not prime material for a weapon system.
COVID-19 may have slowed down economic activities, but it is not an
existential threat to the U.S. government. Despite the potential impact
on national security, pandemic diseases are best addressed separately
from biological defense concepts. The U.S. military does anticipate the
potential use of biological weapons in combat operations. In that light,
the Department of Defense has a counter-weapons of mass destruction
(WMD) strategy and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
(CBRN) defense concept to guide its efforts to prevent, protect against,
and respond to adversaries using biological weapons.6 The ratification
of the BWC has significantly reduced the number of potential adversaries
that might use traditional biological warfare (BW) agents, allowing one
to focus on particular actors and military scenarios. The traditional
biological warfare agents such as anthrax, pneumatic plague, smallpox,
and tularemia are still potent candidates for future warfare. However,
[the employment of said weapons may look very different than envisioned
during the Cold War.]{.underline} North Korea may be the exception to
this statement, as it is unclear how that nation would use
unconventional weapons, but its operational concept for warfare appears
to be based in an industrial age, massed firepower approach, similar to
what NATO might have anticipated in the 1970s.[7 China and Iran are
assessed as not complying with the BWC, and **Russia and North Korea are
believed to have retained offensive biological weapons programs**.8
While we can understand the biological warfare model that North Korea
might employ, this does not necessarily apply to Russia's and China's
concepts of employment for biological weapons.]{.underline} The Cold War
model of using massive amounts of biological agents against troop
concentrations, major population centers, and large military sites such
as air bases and seaports requires large-scale production, storage, and
testing capability. As Russia and China have modernized their nuclear
and conventional forces, they have also changed their approach toward
military confrontations with the United States and partner nations.
While preparing for the possibility of total war, both countries have
focused on conducting regional operations against U.S. allies using
methods that fall below the threshold of open conflict.9 Their nuclear
arsenals cast a coercive shadow over regional operations that allow
those nations to aggressively push and attain their political
objectives. [As a result, a clandestine biological weapons program can
offer them a capability to perform single, small-scale chemical or
biological weapons attacks on focused targets (facilities or
individuals) while claiming to be compliant with the BWC]{.underline}.10
The former Soviet Union had a massive biological warfare program,
unmatched by any historical measure. Despite extensive documentation of
this program, the Russian Federation has not fully acknowledged the
former Soviet Union BW program. [The State Department has gone so far as
to designate specific Russian government facilities as "acting contrary
to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United
States" through their association as military defense facilities
associated with a BW research program.11 These are not recent concerns.
Analysts will point out that]{.underline} in 2012, then Prime Minister
[Vladimir Putin talked about creating "weapon systems that use different
physical principles ... (beam, geophysical, wave, genetic,
psychophysical and other types of weapons)."]{.underline}12 However, it
is unclear that this attributed quote referred to a return to developing
biological weapons to support military conflict[. In 2019, Putin
directed a budget of 220 billion rubles (or \$3.3 billion) toward the
development of genetic technologies that could support a wide range of
applications (biomedical, agricultural, or biodefense).13 At the same
time, the Russian government has claimed that the United States is
building offensive BW laboratories in countries surrounding Russia
through the Biological Threat Reduction Program.]{.underline} For
instance, the "Lugar Center for Public Health Research" in Tbilisi,
Georgia, was funded by U.S. defense funds, but its intent is to promote
health security against natural infectious disease outbreaks.14 In
response to U.S. government accusations of China's role in the COVID-19
outbreak, Chinese government officials have recently echoed the same
claims that the U.S. government has created biological weapons near
their borders.15 This type of disinformation campaign falls squarely in
the "gray zone" set of tools[. Both China and Russia **have ignored**
international efforts to prevent the proliferation of unconventional
weapons technology and materials]{.underline}. China's position as one
of the leaders of the global bioeconomy increases its potential for
realized or latent advanced biological warfare capabilities. Beijing
appears committed to becoming a leader in biotechnology, which holds the
promise of myriad public health applications. Yet, many biotechnology
applications are dual-use, capable of delivering both public health
benefits and advances in biological warfare capabilities. As one top
U.S. expert noted, China "is pursuing a very aggressive strategy to
become the world leader in biotechnology."16 Sustained public and
private investment in synthetic biology technologies needed for DNA
sequencing and synthesis as well as gene editing have enabled China to
develop a wide array of dual-use biotechnologies in the field of
synthetic biology. Many experts anticipate that synthetic biology
advances will enable the development of "new and novel biomaterials" to
include advanced bioweapons.17 As a 2020 Brookings Institution study
noted, "[The determination of China's one-party state to become a
leading player in biotechnology is reflected by the rapid growth in
investment in the sector. Some estimates claim that collectively,
China's central, local, and provincial governments have invested over
\$100 billion in life sciences research and development."18 China's
sustained and sizeable government investment in domestic biotechnology
has created an industrial base capable of developing and manufacturing a
range of extant and novel biological warfare agents]{.underline}. And
[while the possibility of developing novel biological warfare agents is
present, it is more probable that China wants to use its biotechnology
lead to produce superior commercial pharmaceuticals and to enhance its
military forces. There is always speculation that advances in the life
sciences will drive an evolution in biological weapons, **making them
more lethal, more environmentally hardy, more targeted toward specific
populations**]{.underline}, or more able to confound contemporary
detection systems. This belief used to be rooted in the 1970s rise of
biotechnology, and then it was 1990s genetics driving the concerns.
Today, it is the promise (and dangers) of synthetic biology. And while
it is true that one could always improve characteristics of certain
biological weapons, there are significant drawbacks as to such an
approach.19 Assuming that an adversary might develop altered biological
weapons to be more operationally relevant, this would still be a
violation of treaty (if it were China or Russia) and international
norms. [Modifying a biological organism to enhance its resistance to
antibiotics might in turn reduce other desired characteristics, such as
its lethality or dissemination qualities. Any use of a genetically
modified organism would run the risk of direct attribution to a
particular source]{.underline}. Western military forces lack the
capability to detect the deliberate use of biological weapons until
after exposure. In addition, U.S. forces lack vaccines for a number of
traditional biological warfare agents, let alone engineered diseases.20
Any nation with an advanced industrial capability can easily develop
biological agents that can damage or destroy crops or livestock, in
addition to targeting humans. There is no need for an overly
sophisticated engineered biological warfare agent à la the latest James
Bond movie, No Time to Die. And even if military forces had tactical
biological detectors that could identify all biological warfare agents
in a timely enough fashion to put on protective masks, traditional
biological weapons would still be an effective strategic weapon against
a civilian populace, its livestock, or cropland. There is no possibility
that the United States and its Western allies can make biological
weapons obsolete.21 At the same time, we do not need to overexaggerate
the threat of biological weapons as some Hollywood scripts portray them.
There are several options that could be explored. The traditional
approach has been to develop chemical and biological defense as a
combined operational concept. Both chemical and biological warfare
agents use similar delivery systems and target the human body's
physiological response to hazards. Under the larger construct of
countering WMD threats, [the U.S. government can engage in arms control
negotiations to limit biological weapons use, use preemptive strikes to
target a nation's WMD capability, and respond to its use with protective
equipment that limits the impedance of combat operations. None of these
options are singular to biological threats.]{.underline} A second option
is to task the medical community to identify and respond to both
biological warfare attacks and natural disease outbreaks while limiting
reliance on biological detectors and technical experts. [The U.S. Air
Force, for instance, endorses a biological defense concept that is
separate from chemical defense and that relies on the medical community
for initial detection and identification.22 This is a very specific
focus on biological threats that includes a conscious decision to limit
investments in people and equipment in response to a lower probability
of deliberate biological attacks.]{.underline} The Air Force concept is
a subset of its counter WMD operations, as the Army's CBRN defense
efforts are. The U.S. Army recently released a biological defense
strategy that calls for the "synchronized implementation" of both
biological warfare defense and infectious natural diseases across the
Army.23 Interestingly, the office responsible for implementing this
strategy is the U.S. Army Nuclear and Countering Weapons of Mass
Destruction Agency, not the Army's chemical-biological defense
specialists and not the Army's medical experts who respectively own
those areas of expertise. It is not immediately clear as to whether this
strategy calls for the development of a stand-alone biological defense
concept that combines capabilities for both infectious natural diseases
and deliberate biological releases, or just a single agency that manages
two very different concepts (counter-WMD and force health protection)
that have a common scientific origin. The strategy details four "lines
of effort" that include developing and managing talent and facilities
that address biological threats; maintaining a biological common
operating picture and awareness of biological defense forensics;
building a readiness posture that includes protection, response, and
training for biological defense capabilities; and directing
modernization efforts for biological defense concepts and doctrine. Will
this new governance structure fundamentally change how the Army does
biological defense? Given policy and budget direction, probably not.
This is not the first time a military agency has suggested moving all
biodefense activities into a portfolio for medical countermeasures for
infectious diseases. There is an almost instinctual movement toward
putting medical experts in charge of developing capabilities for
countering all biological threats; however, that does not work for two
reasons. First, given a collection of biological threats---whether
natural, deliberate, or accidental---medical leaders will always
consider infectious natural diseases the most important concerns because
of the large numbers of service members and their dependents who get
sick from natural diseases. And there are a lot of infectious natural
diseases to address. In 1990, the U.S. military found itself without
adequate vaccines for anthrax and botulin toxin when it was preparing to
face an Iraqi military force that had an active chemical and biological
weapons program. This was due to a deliberate decision to deprioritize
research and development for biological warfare agents and focus instead
on countermeasures for natural diseases such as chikungunya virus and
diarrheal diseases. [Second, while the response to biological threats
has often had a common core, the prevention and protection against
biological threats certainly does not.]{.underline} While one can try to
deter adversaries from using biological weapons, Mother Nature cannot be
deterred. [Protecting military forces from biological weapons during
combat operations requires a completely different approach than
protecting a military base's population from natural diseases. This
requires a level of nuance to understand that a single biodefense
concept cannot protect fundamentally different populations with
different requirements and facing fundamentally different biological
threats.]{.underline} There is a reason why there are different budgets
and authorities for dealing with biological warfare agents, natural
biological diseases, and biological research laboratory accidents. The
primary purposes of any strategy document are to identify a specific
mission or program, to identify policy objectives that should drive
discrete programs, and to offer a plan to achieve those objectives. In
the military, this is called "ends, ways, and means." Ideally, a
strategy will also aid decision makers in moving resources toward those
goals that require funding to achieve those objectives. So, the problem
with a biological defense strategy that aims to address all biological
threats---whether at the Army, the DOD, or national level---is that
there are multiple agencies with budget elements who are already
directed to address specific biological threats. I will argue that at
least five biological threat sectors require consideration in any
biological defense strategy: disease prevention as a function of public
health, bioterrorism response as a function of homeland security,
military biodefense as a function as countering WMD, biosurety as a
function of laboratory practices, and biosecurity and biosafety as a
function of agricultural and food industries. None of these are new
security concerns. Each has a dedicated government agency that focuses
on a distinct threat using a congressionally approved budget. Because
each biological threat sector already has a lead agency and agenda to
pursue, the question comes as to what a centralized biological defense
strategy would change or impact the direction of federal government or
military biodefense programs. Public health efforts addressing
infectious biological diseases, to include aspects of disease prevention
in the military's force health protection program, have been around for
more than one hundred years. One of the challenges in the U.S. public
health program is that it is federalized, meaning that states and local
jurisdictions implement public health programs while the federal
government provides research and funding for specific purposes. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National
Institutes of Health represent the largest government agencies in this
area, putting tens of billions of dollars against infectious disease
research, surveillance, and response. [Within the military, the Army's
Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases has a research and
development program for infectious diseases to address potential
biological threats to service members in U.S. and overseas
theaters.]{.underline} Top threats include tuberculosis, measles,
influenza, pneumonia, and malaria. Bioterrorism response is a little
more nebulous, since we have not seen a terrorist group successfully use
a biological hazard to cause mass casualties in the United States since
1984. However, following the 2001 Amerithrax incidents, the concern that
they might has thrown a few billion dollars a year toward the Department
of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services to
develop response plans for the possibility.24 [The DOD needs to consider
biological terrorism within its installation force protection plans, but
for the most part, it is not an integral part of that effort due to the
very low probability of such an incident. The DOD does have a massive
CBRN Response Enterprise that would assist states and cities in any
federal response to a biological terrorist incident.]{.underline} The
top (realistic) biological threats usually include salmonella, ricin,
botulinum toxin, sewage, and tainted body fluids. Military biodefense
has focused on protecting U.S. forces from biological warfare agents
developed by adversarial nation-states for the purpose of combat
operations. We have always envisioned biological weapons attacks as
large-area coverage, mass casualty events on the battlefield. Because of
technical challenges, military biodefense capabilities were largely
lacking during the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict, leading to a crash
program in the mid-1990s to develop biological detectors and medical
countermeasures for the services. Biological detection and vaccines were
more readily available in 2003 as U.S. forces prepared for possible
Iraqi biological weapons use. There is a central program office that
manages all DOD biological defense programs, receiving maybe a half
billion dollars a year for funding. Their top threats include anthrax,
pneumonic plague, smallpox, tularemia, and brucellosis. The DOD's
Biological Threat Reduction Program, which is more of an effort to
secure other nations' laboratories and hospitals than biodefense,
accounts for less than a \$300 million in annual funding over the past
decade.25 Biosurety addresses the security and safety of laboratory
research labs both across the United States and within the U.S.
military. Unlike traditional biodefense efforts, biosurety is more about
keeping biologicals safe from humans, as opposed to the other way
around. The threat includes both the possibility that a researcher on
the inside might deliberately or accidentally release a dangerous
biological organism, or that an outsider might try to break in and steal
them. There is also the danger of natural disasters or externally
derived accidents to consider. The U.S. Army has had biosurety failures
that resulted in CDC shutdowns at its Dugway Proving Ground (in 2015 due
to anthrax shipments) and Fort Detrick laboratories (in 2019 due to
unsafe laboratory practices). While the CDC has some oversight role for
a small set of select agents and toxins, in general, the CDC can only
provide suggestions on how the U.S. research and development community
should implement good business practices. This area is not well funded
(maybe \$500 million/year) or overseen from the federal level. The top
threats for biosurety are too varied for listing, but in general,
accidents are largely limited to individual researchers and not the
general community surrounding a biological research lab. Biosecurity and
biosafety challenges within the agricultural and food industries have
been of two parts. First, many facilities have significantly large
amounts of livestock or crops to protect against the introduction of any
foreign disease that might wipe out their livelihood. In addition,
foreign pests or animals could displace or eliminate native animals and
crops. Second, there is the challenge of regulating food products as
they are moved from the farm to the table, as the saying goes. Federal
regulations aim to ensure that agricultural products used in meal
production are both safe and accurately labeled. Both the Food and Drug
Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture have responsibilities
to oversee this area, in addition to the Customs and Border Patrol.
There is not a significant DOD equity in this area other than ensuring
that meals prepared for the field are safe and free of contamination.
Because Congress is very interested in ensuring that the public has safe
food and a variety of different foods, this area gets funded between \$3
billion and \$4 billion a year. Its biological threats of concern
include foot-and-mouth disease, swine flu, avian flu, wheat rust, and
invasive species such as Asian carp, zebra mussels, cane toads, and
brown marmorated stink bugs. This is just the tip of the challenge of
trying to address all biological threats---natural, deliberate, and
accidental---under one Army, DOD, or national strategy. There are more
complex discussions as to what would constitute a national
biosurveillance effort---surprisingly, this would not be solely focused
on infectious biological diseases to humans, but also include diseases
affecting animals and plants, as well as chemical or radiological
hazards to any biological organism. [There is the challenge of
addressing the impact of future technologies such as "gain-of-function"
and synthetic biology. Even after we identify all of the potential
issues that surround "biological threats,"]{.underline} [there is the
question of who ought to lead the effort.]{.underline} The public health
community claims that if it were better funded, it could address all
natural disease outbreaks as well as respond to biological terrorism.
[The national security community feels that it needs to have a larger
voice in this effort, given that these are foreign threats that impact
the armed forces and other U.S. national security interests. And given
the national security community's funding and ability to quickly form
new project offices, they could very well dominate the discussion, which
could result in different priorities than what the public health
community sees as important.]{.underline} Concluding Thoughts [The
military's primary concern should be on deliberate biological threats,
but there is no question that it has been distracted by COVID-19 and the
general topic of natural disease outbreaks.]{.underline} If the DOD's
Chemical-Biological Defense Program decides to move from working on
countermeasures to biological warfare agents and focus instead on
"threat-agnostic" systems that address all biological threats, the
military will not get necessary detectors, protective ensembles, medical
vaccines, or decontaminants for biological warfare agents due to the
larger number and greater impact of natural infectious diseases. This
is, in essence, what happened in the 1980s; because the military medical
community was focused on research and development for infectious
diseases and not biological warfare agents, U.S. forces were unprepared
for biological warfare in 1990.26 [Military concepts of future war
assure us that biological and nuclear warfare are expected threats to
U.S. forces.27 In the case of a conflict with North Korea, it may not
look that different than Cold War concepts of massive, large-coverage
attacks on U.S. military bases. In the case of China and Russia**, it is
less clear what the future of biological war will be**. As technology
such as drone swarms, artificial intelligence, and synthetic biology
continue to mature, the shape of **biological warfare threats will
evolve**.]{.underline} One can assume that the traditional biological
warfare agents will still be viable candidates, or possibly enhancements
on their natural forms. Terrorist use of biological hazards may be
limited to crude toxins and improvised delivery systems---still a threat
to installation force protection measures, but not necessarily a mass
casualty event. [This future operating environment requires us to focus
on enhancing the survivability of critical infrastructure---in
particular, command and control, power projection, and logistics
bases---and the resiliency of military operations while impacted by
biological weapons]{.underline}. [The only way to succeed in moving
forward in a future biological defense posture is not, then, to dilute
the Army's efforts by trying to manage the development of defensive
capabilities for all natural disease outbreaks and deliberate biological
attacks under a single general construct. There needs to be a
laser-sharp focus on both pandemic preparedness and biological defense
during combat operations.]{.underline} In addition, the DOD needs to
ensure that its biological research and development laboratories have
the best practices in place to avoid future shutdowns due to biosurety
challenges. This is not an either/or discussion nor is it the time to
radically revise how military forces accomplish biological defense.
Instead, [Army leaders need to **engage** in these discussions, despite
the complicated technical nature of the topic, and ensure that future
operations can be maintained despite the threat of biological weapons
use]{.underline}.

### AT: Bioterrorism

#### Bioterrorism is just myths -- analysis proves. And there is no impact.

G. **Greub**, 6-1-20**14**, \[(Institute of Microbiology, University of
Lausanne and University Hospital Centre, Lausanne, Switzerland and 2)
Department of Infectious Diseases, Centre for Tropical Medicine and
Travel Medicine, Division of Internal Medicine, Academic Medical Centre,
University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) \"Bioterrorism:
myth or reality?,\" Clinical Microbiology and Infection,

Interestingly, although there are no doubt many features that
distinguish the two topics, [the public's perception of bioterrorism, in
its broad sense, shares some striking features with the human interest
in viral haemorrhagic fevers, as seen during the recent ebolavirus
disease outbreak in Guinea]{.underline} \[1\]. Although the [overall
risk of disease propagation and spread beyond the immediately involved
patients is limited, interest in these phenomena rises to an almost
hysterical level during an outbreak situation, and then collapses as
quickly as it built up immediately after the worst seems to be
over.]{.underline} No matter how far away the outbreak may be, and how
remote the risk of spread is, some features (the agent striking
apparently out of the blue, and then 'disappearing' again; the disease
being gruesome and killing cruelly, at least in the beginning of an
outbreak) make the waxing and waning public response, often tinged with
sensationalism, a characteristic feature accompanying viral haemorrhagic
fever outbreaks that is not dissimilar to the reaction towards perceived
or real bioweapon threats. In this CMI theme issue, we attempt to answer
the important question of whether bioterrorism is a myth or reality,
which is of relevance for clinical microbiologists, hospital hygiene
specialists, infectious diseases clinicians, basic researchers, defence
specialists, and public health policy-makers. In this issue, we also
decided to address several key questions, listed in Table 1, with the
input of biosafety officers and bioterrorism specialists from three
different countries. We aimed at providing a concise overview on key
facts and current points of discussion, rather than providing an
exhaustive textbook-like inventory and bibliography. Consequently, we
are confident that this compilation of articles constitutes a highly
informative and also gripping read. In the first article, by Jansen et
al. \[2\], [the definitions of biological warfare, biocrime and
bioterrorism are provided, clearly separating terrorist from criminal
use of biological agents. Jansen et al. also provide a very precise and
exhaustive list of biological agents that have been involved in
bioterrorism events, and that may serve as a basis for assessing the
real threat, and thus pitching the level of awareness and preparedness
of the various stakeholders at the most appropriate level.]{.underline}
In addition, this article provides some information for infectious
disease specialists, including the main clinical syndromes, incubation
times, mortality rates and treatment options for all listed
'bioterrorism agents'. Moreover, this article highlights the fact that,
in the 20th century, only ten events were recorded during the first 70
years, whereas 17 and 153 events were recorded from 1970 to 1989 and
from 1990 to 1999, respectively. This raised another question: does the
higher number of events registered more recently reflect the reality, or
is it only the result of a strong reporting bias? If this the case, we
may wonder why, when and how our perception has become biased. To answer
the latter question, Barras and Greub \[3\] performed a detailed
historical analysis of reported events from ancient times through to the
21st century. [Although there is no doubt that, on several occasions,
biological agents have been used to cause panic and terror among civil
populations, their true frequency of use and impact remain very
difficult to appreciate, because: (i) data are largely lacking from
before the Pasteurian microbiology era; (ii) reality was often hidden
and manipulated by politicians, as the 'truth' about biological attacks
may not be openly disseminated, given its intrinsically non-ethical
nature, and because information may be classified as secret by the
authorities, as it may be considered to be sensitive;]{.underline} and
(iii) the passage of time adds an additional layer of complexity, by
distorting facts. Thus, although illustrations such as the one provided
on the cover of this special issue may suggest the dissemination of
plague by the use of infected arrows, such illustrations may also simply
represent an allegory of the contagiousness of Yersinia pestis. The
detailed historical analysis conducted by the authors includes the
contemporary period, which is a period dominated, in terms of
bioterrorism, by the anthrax letters attack, which resulted in at least
45 infections requiring hospitalization. The importance of the anthrax
letters attack led most clinical microbiology laboratories to develop
diagnostic approaches for the detection of Bacillus anthracis. As
outlined by Jaton and Greub \[4\], the level of preparedness
progressively increased, although most initial procedures were simply
based on the procedures used for suspected haemorrhagic fever. However,
as shown in Table 2, [there are major differences between a suspected
bioterrorism attack and the detection of a naturally infected
haemorrhagic fever case that should be taken into account. Also
important is the fact that most clinical microbiology laboratories
progressively decrease their preparedness when the threat decreases.
Therefore, in order to reduce the risk of not being adequately prepared,
it is important to have regular exercises using true quality
controls]{.underline} (Fig. 1) [or using plasmid-based positive
controls, as using 'real' biosafety level 3 agents may be difficult,
owing to their association with significant biological risks.
Finally,]{.underline} Wurtz et al. \[5\] highlight the [problems that
inevitably arise from the strict legislation aimed at making unlawful
access to and experimentation with potential bioweapon agents
impossible. The unwanted adverse effect is that well-intended, and much
needed, research for the 'right' reasons has also become difficult, if
not completely unfeasible, in some respects.]{.underline} The article of
Wurtz et al. will stimulate fresh debate on how best to strike the
balance between protecting the public from aggression involving
biological agents, and allowing the biomedical research that is needed
to keep the 'real-life' natural infectious agent at bay and to enable
progress in our understanding of the ecology, epidemiology and best
diagnostic, prevention and treatment options for what may constitute a
minute bioweapons threat, but a real natural threat. [We conclude that
bioterrorism and smaller-scale atrocities involving biological agents do
indeed constitute a reality---a reality surrounded by
myths.]{.underline} We hope that this series of articles will facilitate
reasoned discussion of a problem whose absolute and relative dimensions
may be limited, but that we must not ignore.

DHS WAgustin 🛏

**[Pakistan and India have]{.underline}** **[engaged in
military]{.underline}** and nuclear **[CBMs]{.underline}** [on numerous
occasions]{.underline}, despite non-cordial relations. The
**[first]{.underline}** **[step]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** the
**[military CBMs was the establishment of a hotline]{.underline}**
**[between the militaries]{.underline}** in 1971 following the model of
the United States' and USSR\'s military communications in the same
timeframe ([Ahmar
2001](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222),
87). However, **[the hotline]{.underline}** between the Director
Generals of Military Operations of both countries **[remained
symbolic]{.underline}**, **[and no practical advantages were effectively
achieved for maintaining peaceful relations]{.underline}**. The
**[hotline works well during peacetime]{.underline}** **[while it gets
suspended during crises build-ups, rendering it, in essence,
useless]{.underline}**. The sitting prime ministers of both countries,
Benazir Bhutto and Rajiv Gandhi, signed the next major CBM under the
umbrella of the Nuclear Threat Initiatives. **[This CBM aimed to prevent
attacks]{.underline}** **[on each other\'s nuclear
facilities]{.underline}** **[but does not provide any prevention against
foreign allies attacking such installations]{.underline}**. This measure
enabled the exchange of a list of nuclear facilities between both the
countries in 1992 (Shahid-ur-Rehman Khan
[1992](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222))
which helped to build trust and both the nuclear rivals respected the
arrangements during the peace as well as during times of increased
crisis. In 1991, Pakistan and India\'s CBMs progressed further as they
signed an agreement for prior notification regarding military exercises
and air space violations, especially near the LoC. This set of CBMs
opened further channels of communication in the military and diplomatic
domains to avoid the repetition of earlier crises but it could not
achieve the desired results owing to the non-availability of
implementation structures. The next CBM milestone was the 1992 agreement
on the complete prohibition of chemical weapons---both countries
declared that they do not possess any chemical weapons. However, these
CBMs suffered a considerable setback once India declared its chemical
weapons arsenal under the Chemical Weapons Convention ([Nuclear Threat
Initiative
2011a](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
Such incidents created further suspicion between both countries---which
were already having problematic relations---and halted the advancement
in the process of confidence building. Pakistan considered the incident
as a violation of the bilateral agreement which widened the gulf in
trust deficit between the two countries. In the wake of this incident,
no further progress was achieved until 1999. Later, Nawaz Sharif and
Vajpayee concluded the Lahore Accord in 1999, which was a milestone
agreement for peacebuilding following the nuclear tests in 1998. This
agreement incorporated the concept of developing and employing CBMs in
both the conventional military and nuclear domains to avoid any untoward
nuclear weapons launch situations and to reduce the prospects for future
conflicts ([Nuclear Threat Initiative
2011b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
Unfortunately, this set of CBMs was undermined by the Kargil Conflict,
which started a few months after the declaration. This time it was the
Pakistani side that undermined the peace efforts as political and
military leaderships were not on the same page. Here the political
leadership tried to put some mechanisms in place for peaceful
coexistence, but the military institution spoiled these efforts. This
problem necessitates the requirement of structures that can implement
and sustain CBMs without significant interference from any state
institution, military in particular. From 1999 to 2003, tensions
remained high between both the states due to large-scale deployments
along the LoC, plus terrorist attacks in Srinagar and on the Indian
parliament. The UN General Assembly session of 2003 carved out a route
toward a ceasefire and later on to direct negotiations between the
political leadership of both countries ([Khawaja
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222),
120--121). A new set of military and nuclear CBMs was then worked upon
which included the reduction of troops along the LoC, no further
development of military posts, and prior information regarding the
testing of ballistic missiles ([Krepon
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
The composite dialogue process constituted a major step forward which
aimed to resolve the issues between both countries through a strategy
that satisfies the demands of both countries ([Padder
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
This dialogue process provided the opportunity to discuss the peace
process through a diverse range of domains including the Kashmir issue.
However, all these CBMs halted in 2008 ([Gul
2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222))
after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai for which India blamed Pakistan.
Later, very few efforts were initiated in 2014 and 2015, but those did
not work due to pre-existing notions of trust deficit and further
accusations of terrorist attacks. [The primary issues in the
implementation of the military and nuclear CBMs]{.underline} **[are the
non-availability of a framework, transparency issues, and lack of
trust]{.underline}**. [Political aspects will also play a significant
role in the success of any military and nuclear CBMs]{.underline},
**[yet military and security concerns continue to undermine political
will]{.underline}** between these two states. While Pakistan and India
are so-called democratic countries, they do not have liberal democratic
structures and the separation of powers remains a contentious issue.
Additionally, [the policies adopted through CBMs]{.underline} **[proved
to be thoroughly incompatible]{.underline}** with follow-up actions
because the military and political leadership in both countries remained
suspicious of each other. **[These issues obstructed the implementation
of military and nuclear CBMs in both letter and spirit]{.underline}**.
The recurring crises between Pakistan and India after the Pulwama
attacks of 2019 highlight the shortfalls of the concept of nuclear
deterrence between both South Asian neighbors. Cyberspace also provides
a new domain for waging wars and there are no existing agreements
between Pakistan and India in this domain. A cyber-attack may prove
disastrous in provoking an unintentional war in the region ([Yamin
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).

// DHS WAgustin 🍞

Fifty years ago this week, former U.S. President Richard Nixon flew to
China, setting the stage for a dramatic shift in relations between the
two countries. Much has changed since that visit, not always for the
better. Despite a flurry of diplomatic activity over the past year,
U.S.-China ties remain tense. Discussions in
[Alaska](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56452471) and
[Tianjin](https://www.state.gov/deputy-secretary-shermans-visit-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)
yielded few, if any, breakthroughs. While friendlier in tone, the recent
summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden
led only to
[agreements](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/17/xi-biden-summit-us-china-policy/)
to hold yet more talks, albeit on important issues such as strategic
stability. The lone bilateral bright spot has been some cooperation on
[climate](https://www.state.gov/u-s-china-joint-glasgow-declaration-on-enhancing-climate-action-in-the-2020s/).
Since the summit, the [Biden]{.underline} [administration
[announced](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062016949/president-biden-announces-a-diplomatic-boycott-of-the-being-winter-olympics)

[bill](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-passes-bill-targeting-china-over-uyghur-forced-labor-n1286160)
aimed at countering China's forced labor abuses in Xinjiang. **[The two
sides' antagonistic stances on issues related to]{.underline}**
security, economics**[, technology,]{.underline}** and ideology **[have
largely crystalized, leaving little space for the adjustments that could
relieve simmering tensions.]{.underline}** Below, Paul Haenle and Sam
Bresnick analyze how the two countries got here and how they can move
forward. WHY ARE THE TWO SIDES STUCK? Former U.S. President Donald Trump
ushered in a more confrontational era in U.S.-China relations, and Biden
has largely maintained his predecessor's approach to Beijing, albeit
with a more equanimous tone and embrace of multilateralism. The [U.S.
government has for decades been concerned by China's
mercantilism]{.underline}, rapid military modernization, and illiberal
approach to human rights, but it had held out hope that China might
liberalize through increasingly robust contact with the rest of the
world. That has not happened, and the United States and others have lost
patience with China's state capitalist system, militarization of the
South China Sea, and increasingly [authoritarian
governance](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law.html).
But Beijing is not backing down. Despite facing pronounced international
pushback during the pandemic, Xi has become even more confident in
China's economic system, governance model, and approach to international
affairs. "Time and momentum are on China's side," he
[argued](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3117314/xi-jinping-says-time-and-momentum-chinas-side-he-sets-out)
last year at a high-level meeting, though many analysts accuse the party
of
[overconfidence](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-From-leader-to-students-overconfidence-clouds-China).
At the same time, Chinese officials are increasingly looking askance at
their U.S. counterparts. Many appear to believe that the United States,
though still a formidable power, is in the early stages of an
[inevitable
decline](https://www.economist.com/china/2021/03/31/china-is-betting-that-the-west-is-in-irreversible-decline).
Just as China resumes its rightful place atop the hierarchy of Asian
nations, Beijing's thinking goes, the United States' unresolved racial
justice issues, income inequality, and political polarization will
catalyze an irreversible diminution of U.S. power in Asia and across the
globe. Complicating matters further, the **[U.S. and
Chinese]{.underline}** **[publics]{.underline}** **[are increasingly
distrustful of each other.]{.underline}** A whopping 89 percent of
American respondents to a recent
[survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/)
from the Pew Research Center consider China a competitor or enemy, while
around [two-thirds](https://uscnpm.org/the-pulse/) of Chinese
respondents view the United States unfavorably or very unfavorably. Such
negative mutual perceptions would likely hamper each side's ability to
recalibrate its approach to the other. Finally, **[the two sides'
divergent framings of the relationship are contributing to the ongoing
[stalemate](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202107/t20210726_9134602.html)]{.underline}**.
Discussions with high-level Chinese scholars and former government
officials have revealed that Beijing prefers to define the bilateral
relationship as a peaceful coexistence guided by shared principles,
consensus, and possible cooperation. **[China is frustrated that the
United States is more focused on competing with and confronting
Beijing]{.underline}**. In Washington, however, great power rivalry,
defined more by competition and confrontation than cooperation, has
become the central framework for bilateral ties. HOW HAVE THESE
DIFFERING VIEWS AFFECTED POLICYMAKING? The pronounced turn in U.S.
policy toward China, beginning with the Trump administration, has not
led to self-reflection on the part of Beijing. Chinese scholars and
experts initially appeared somewhat
[surprised](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/asia/china-trade-war-trump.html)
that many of the economic, security, and technology policies that
Beijing has pursued for years have recently precipitated robust policy
responses from the United States. The ruling party believes that it is
merely continuing down the same path it established some years back,
which has led to its attributing the downturn in the bilateral

complaints about human rights violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and
Tibet as disingenuous, given the United States' own problems with racial
justice and homelessness, as well as its high levels of wealth and
income inequality. In short, China sees the United States as a declining
power that is attempting to keep a rising China from overtaking it. The
United States, as expected, has a very different view of bilateral
dynamics. Washington blames the downturn in relations on China's
increasing assertiveness abroad and repressiveness at home. U.S.
officials are concerned that China, through its support of authoritarian
regimes, is chipping away at the liberal international order and trying
to create "[a world safe for
autocracy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-06-11/world-safe-autocracy)";

and the [United Arab
Emirates](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=dubai+chinese+military+bas)
will allow Beijing to challenge Washington's security primacy; and that
its state capitalist, mercantilist system threatens the rules-based
economic order. Beijing's incarceration of around [1 million Uighurs and
other Muslim
minorities](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-repression-uyghurs-xinjiang)
in Xinjiang, increasingly strict online censorship, and prosecution of
dissidents have further fueled Washington's desire to enact more
aggressive responses. WHAT DOES EACH SIDE WANT OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP?
Our conversations have revealed that China wants the United States to
afford it the space it believes it deserves as a rising power, at least
in its own backyard. Beijing, as the preeminent Asian security and
economic actor, sees the United States' military presence in East and
Southeast Asia as inherently threatening. Moreover, it hopes that
Washington will ease pressure, especially regarding economics and
technology, as well as refrain from engaging in ideological competition
in service of impugning Beijing's governance model and human rights
record. But perhaps China's most significant wish is for the United
States to acknowledge the legitimacy of its economic and political
systems. Given that the United States views China's economic and
political practices as antithetical to its own, as well as to those of
countries acting within a healthy, properly functioning international
system, Washington is unlikely to refrain from impeaching Chinese
authoritarianism, mercantilism, and treatment of ethnic minorities and
dissidents. The United States' tougher policies and more confrontational
approach are meant to push back on and defend against a range of Chinese
domestic and foreign practices that threaten to undermine the
international rules and norms that have been in place since the end of
World War II, as well as raise the costs for China to revise that very
order. In general, Washington would prefer that Beijing dial back or
eliminate its economic and innovation mercantilism, respect other
countries' sovereignties, agree to peacefully resolve disputes, and
abide by international agreements on human rights. HOW CAN THE TWO SIDES
RECONCILE THEIR DIFFERENCES? Biden has opted to use a calmer, more
restrained tone with Beijing than did his predecessor, with the aim of
avoiding escalation. Moreover, unlike some Trump administration
[officials](https://www.wsj.com/articles/secretary-of-state-pompeo-to-urge-chinese-people-to-change-the-communist-party-11595517729),
Biden's team has made it clear that Washington is not seeking regime
change in China. And though Biden
[criticized](https://www.cfr.org/election2020/candidate-tracker) Trump's
lack of a clear set of goals or a coherent interagency policy framework
for addressing the China challenge, his administration has yet to
release its long-awaited [China
strategy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-01-14/washingtons-missing-china-strategy)
(though China does figure prominently in its recently issued
[Indo-Pacific
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/U.S.-Indo-Pacific-Strategy.pdf)).
Until that document is issued, the finer points of the administration's
plans to compete with Beijing, as well as the end goal of such
competition, will remain fuzzy. A clear articulation of U.S. aims would
be helpful in Washington's efforts to secure greater international
cooperation from allies and partners in addressing the challenges China
poses. It would also provide Chinese and U.S. leaders a starting point
from which to negotiate the future of bilateral ties. In China, there is
considerable room for greater self-reflection. Chinese leaders should
closely examine how Beijing's own aggressive diplomacy, economic
statecraft, military buildup, and human rights violations have alarmed
and unsettled the United States and many other countries, especially
those in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Across many conversations,
few, if any, Chinese experts have acknowledged that Beijing's actions
have played a role in the cratering of U.S.-China relations.
Furthermore, they are reluctant to acknowledge that numerous nations'
hardening stances toward China are driven by China's activities rather
than U.S. coercion. Acknowledging its agency in harming relations, as
well as its ability to take proactive steps to put U.S.-China ties on
better footing, would constitute important initial gestures by the
Chinese side. Moreover, China's willingness to take more responsibility
for its own actions and modify its policy and rhetoric would go a long
way toward stabilizing bilateral dynamics. There is no doubt the
U.S.-China relationship will remain competitive going forward.
Preventing bilateral ties from becoming even more hostile and
adversarial, however, should constitute a common aim for both countries.
Biden understands this, as he stressed the importance of developing
guardrails and establishing strategic stability talks between the two
governments [during his virtual
summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/readout-of-president-bidens-virtual-meeting-with-president-xi-jinping-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)
with Xi. Implementing robust crisis management mechanisms would also
prove a useful step in augmenting both nations' abilities to control
escalation in the event of a military incident in the increasingly
crowded waters and air space off of China's eastern and southern coasts.
Washington and Beijing also should establish an effective
problem-solving mode for the bilateral relationship. Many observers
stress the importance of U.S.-China cooperation on transnational issues
where the two sides have common interests---[climate
change](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2021/10/28/rebuilding-us-chinese-cooperation-on-climate-change-the-science-and-technology-opportunity/),
[nuclear
nonproliferation](https://www.brookings.edu/research/revitalizing-nonproliferation-cooperation-with-russia-and-china/),
and [global
health](https://www.csis.org/analysis/advancing-us-china-health-security-cooperation-era-strategic-competition),
among others. These efforts are certainly important, but they are quite
ambitious and often hampered by Washington's and Beijing's different
approaches to managing international issues. The two countries have thus
far failed to make progress in most areas. That does not mean they
should abandon these efforts. But perhaps the United States and China
should devote more energy toward trying to create a problem-solving
approach for addressing more pointed irritants, such as limits on
journalist visas and consulate closures. Such a method has already
yielded dividends regarding the [former
issue](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/us/politics/us-china-journalists.html).
The two countries should focus on how to build on those smaller
successes to work through larger problems in other areas. By committing
to this pragmatic approach, the United States and China may be able to
find a way to put a floor under deteriorating relations, begin to build
goodwill, and lay the foundation for taking on the larger structural
issues in areas, like trade and technology, that will be key to
determining the future health and welfare of the U.S.-China relationship
over the long term. Despite the two nations' differing mindsets and
approaches to bilateral ties, starting small could prove the best method
through which to, eventually, realize large gains.

## AT: Russian Sanctions

#### Sanctions fail -- They hurt the people NOT the military or leaders

Western sanctions against Russia,
<https://www.zawya.com/en/world/uk-and-europe/the-failure-of-western-sanctions-against-russia-gycrd12k>\]
//DHS WAgustin

[Historically]{.underline}, **[sanctions have failed to achieve any
political goals]{.underline}**. **[It is the worst weapon]{.underline}**
that the modern and contemporary **[international system has
produced]{.underline}**. **[Every time when sanctions were
imposed]{.underline}**, **[it was the people who paid the
price]{.underline}**, **[while these sanctions failed to harm the
leaders and officials in the targeted countries.]{.underline}** With the
beginning of the Russian war on Ukraine, a series of Western sanctions
are being slapped on the Russian side, and that has covered almost all
fields. This is up to the extent that one of the Western universities
canceled a lecture on Tolstoy on the pretext that he was a Russian! [The
Western nations wished that their sanctions would be so crushing and
thus deal a fatal blow to the Russian economy, **and hence they have
frozen Russian deposits as well as Russian assets abroad, leaving no
room for the Western hand to reach unless it was punished.** The worst
scenario was the]{.underline} **[attempt to isolate Russia from the
global banking payment system called SWIFT]{.underline}** (The Society
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) **[as this makes
import and export a very complicated affair even though it would be
possible]{.underline}**. **[The Russian economy absorbed the first
blow]{.underline}**, despite the sagging ruble, but it **[quickly
recovered]{.underline}**, **[and even achieved higher gains than before
the war.]{.underline}** The obvious question that must be asked by
Western circles: what is the purpose of these sanctions? The answer, as
presented by Western politicians, is twofold: the first is the weakening
of the Russian economy, which affects the stability of the Putin
government and undermines confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin
on the Russian street. However, **[the results of these sanctions were
counterproductive and the proportion of opponents of the war is very
small on the Russian street]{.underline}**, [and President Putin's
popularity is on the rise]{.underline}. [The second aspect is the effect
on the Russian war machine]{.underline}. [It is true that there were
many difficulties experienced by the Russian forces]{.underline},
especially in the beginning of the war, and the failure to capture Kiev,
and this forced the Russian leadership to change its military plans.
**[But this has nothing to do with the Western sanctions]{.underline}**.
Rather, the armed forces, like **[the Russian economy, have regained
their solidity and seemed more capable of achieving breakthroughs and
steady military progress]{.underline}**. This does not mean victory in
the war, but it means that the **[Russian forces were not affected by
the aforesaid sanctions. The Western sanctions on Russia made the supply
of Ukrainian grain a very difficult issue]{.underline}**, even if it was
done in relatively small quantities, and **[Russia\'s isolation from the
SWIFT regime made the supply of Russian grain no less
difficult.]{.underline}** If we know that both countries export 30
percent of the grain worldwide, it can be understood that the food
crisis that the world is beginning to suffer from, and which threatens
impending famines that might afflict a large number of the third world
countries, even though these countries have no part in the Ukrainian war
or in the conflict between the West and Russia. The worst is that the
[European societies themselves have begun to suffer from the rise in the
prices of essential goods,]{.underline} as the prices of fuels increased
by up to 40 percent, and this led to a rise in most essential goods,
especially foodstuffs. After the experience of the past months, **[the
Western sanctions on Russia are like those who shoot themselves in the
feet.]{.underline}** In fact, **[Moscow has benefited from sanctions on
the energy]{.underline}** **[sector]{.underline}**. What it was unable
to export was compensated by the rise in oil prices. It is clear that
the West must change its strategy, and this can only be done by bitterly
admitting that it has failed miserably in its policy of imposing
sanctions against Russia.

on the design, construction and operation of a [new facility to
demonstrate the commercial feasibility of a full-scale rare earth
element (REE) and critical minerals (CM) extraction and separation
refinery using unconventional resources]{.underline}. When built, this
first-of-a-kind facility, supported by [**\$140 million investment from
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will** support American manufacturing
jobs, and help **build a strong domestic supply chain for** the next
generation of clean **energy technologies**]{.underline} vital to
reaching President Biden's goal of a net-zero emissions future.
"Applying next-generation technology to convert legacy fossil fuel waste
into a domestic source of critical minerals needed to strengthen our
supply chains is a win-win --- delivering a healthier environment and
driving us forward to our clean energy goals," said U.S. Secretary of
Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. "[With **the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law's investment** in the **build** out of this first-of-its kind
critical minerals refinery, we are moving ideas from the lab to the
commercial stage **and demonstrating how America can compete for the
global supply chain to meet the growing demand** for clean energy
technology."]{.underline} Across the United States, there are billions
of tons of coal waste and ash, acid mine drainage, and produced water.
The legacy wastes left behind by coal mining and related activities all
contain a wide variety of valuable minerals and materials. Each of them
offers an untapped resource for producing a wealth of critical minerals.
REEs and CMs are essential materials that are used in a broad range of
technologies that are significant to national security and energy, such
as advanced aircraft, wind turbines, electric vehicles, semiconductors,
and hydrogen fuel cells. [Currently, even when REEs are being mined
within the U.S., they are shipped overseas for processing, before being
sold back to the U.S. in more expensive products.]{.underline}
