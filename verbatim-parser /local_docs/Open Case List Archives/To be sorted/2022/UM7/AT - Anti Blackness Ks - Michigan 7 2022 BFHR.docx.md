UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HISTORY IN THE millennia following the Agricultural
Revolution boils down to a single question[: how did humans organise
themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological
instincts necessary to sustain such networks]{.underline}? The short
answer is that [humans created imagined orders and devised
scripts]{.underline}. These two inventions filled the gaps left by our
biological inheritance.

However, [the appearance of these networks was, for many, a dubious
blessing. The imagined orders sustaining these networks were neither
neutral nor fair.]{.underline} [They divided people into make-believe
groups, arranged in a hierarchy. The upper levels enjoyed privileges and
power, while the lower ones suffered from discrimination and
oppression]{.underline}. [Hammurabi's Code]{.underline}, for example,
[established]{.underline} a pecking order of [superiors, commoners and
slaves. Superiors got all the good things in life. Commoners got what
was left. Slaves got a beating if they complained]{.underline}.

Despite its proclamation of the equality of all men, [the imagined order
established by the Americans in 1776 also]{.underline} established a
hierarchy. It [created a hierarchy between men]{.underline}, who
benefited from it, [and women]{.underline}, whom it left disempowered.
It created a hierarchy [between whites]{.underline}, who enjoyed
liberty, and [blacks and American Indians]{.underline}, who were
considered humans of a lesser type and therefore did not share in the
equal rights of men. Many of those who signed the Declaration of
Independence were slaveholders. They did not release their slaves upon
signing the Declaration, nor did they consider themselves hypocrites. In
their view, the rights of men had little to do with Negroes.

The American order also consecrated the hierarchy between rich and poor.
Most Americans at that time had little problem with the inequality
caused by wealthy parents passing their money and businesses on to their
children. In their view, equality meant simply that the same laws
applied to rich and poor. It had nothing to do with unemployment
benefits, integrated education or health insurance.

[Liberty]{.underline}, too, [carried very different connotations than it
does today]{.underline}. [In 1776, it did not mean that the
disempowered]{.underline} ([certainly not blacks or Indians
or]{.underline}, God forbid, [women]{.underline}) [could gain and
exercise power]{.underline}. [It meant simply that the state could
not]{.underline}, except in unusual circumstances, [confiscate a
citizen's private property or tell him what to do with it.]{.underline}
[The American order]{.underline} [thereby upheld the hierarchy of
wealth]{.underline}, which some thought was mandated by God and others
viewed as representing the immutable laws of nature. Nature, it was
claimed, rewarded merit with wealth while penalising indolence.

All the above-mentioned distinctions -- between free persons and slaves,
between whites and blacks, between rich and poor -- are rooted in
fictions. (The hierarchy of men and women will be discussed later.) Yet
it is an iron rule of history that [[every]{.mark} imagined [hierarchy
**disavows its fictional origins**]{.mark} and claims to be natural and
inevitable]{.underline}. For instance, [many people who have viewed the
hierarchy of free persons and slaves as natural and correct have argued
that slavery is not a human invention.]{.underline} Hammurabi saw it as
ordained by the gods. Aristotle argued that slaves have a 'slavish
nature' whereas free people have a 'free nature'. Their status in
society is merely a reflection of their innate nature.

[Ask white supremacists about the racial hierarchy, and you are in for a
pseudoscientific lecture concerning the biological differences between
the races.]{.underline} You are likely to be told that there is
something in Caucasian blood or genes that makes whites naturally more
intelligent, moral and hardworking. [Ask a diehard capitalist about the
hierarchy of wealth]{.underline}, and [you are likely to
hear]{.underline} that it [is the inevitable outcome of]{.underline}
objective [differences in abilities]{.underline}. The rich have more
money, in this view, because they are more capable and diligent. No one
should be bothered, then, if the wealthy get better health care, better
education and better nutrition. The rich richly deserve every perk they
enjoy.

People with lighter skin colour are typically more in danger of sunburn
than people with darker skin. Yet there was no biological logic behind
the division of South African beaches. Beaches reserved for people with
lighter skin were not characterised by lower levels of ultraviolet
radiation.

[Hindus who adhere to the caste system believe that cosmic forces have
made one caste superior to another]{.underline}. According to a famous
Hindu creation myth, the gods fashioned the world out of the body of a
primeval being, the Purusa. The sun was created from the Purusa's eye,
the moon from the Purusa's brain, the Brahmins (priests) from its mouth,
the Kshatriyas (warriors) from its arms, the Vaishyas (peasants and
merchants) from its thighs, and the Shudras (servants) from its legs.
Accept this explanation and the sociopolitical differences between
Brahmins and Shudras are as natural and eternal as the differences
between the sun and the moon.1 The ancient Chinese believed that when
the goddess Nü Wa created humans from earth, she kneaded aristocrats
from fine yellow soil, whereas commoners were formed from brown mud.2

Yet, to the best of our understanding, **[these [hierarchies are all the
product of human imagination]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Brahmins and
Shudras were]{.mark} not really created by the gods from different body
parts of a primeval being]{.underline}. Instead, [the distinction
between the two castes was [created by laws and norms invented by
humans]{.mark} in northern India about 3,000 years ago]{.underline}.
Contrary to Aristotle, there is no known biological difference between
slaves and free people. Human laws and norms have turned some people
into slaves and others into masters. [Between blacks and
whites]{.underline} there are some objective biological differences,
such as skin colour and hair type, but [there is no evidence that the
differences extend to intelligence or morality.]{.underline}

[Most people claim that their social hierarchy is natural and just,
while those of other societies are based on false and ridiculous
criteria]{.underline}. Modern Westerners are taught to scoff at the idea
of racial hierarchy. They are shocked by laws prohibiting blacks to live
in white neighbourhoods, or to study in white schools, or to be treated
in white hospitals. But the hierarchy of rich and poor -- which mandates
that rich people live in separate and more luxurious neighbourhoods,
study in separate and more prestigious schools, and receive medical
treatment in separate and better-equipped facilities -- seems perfectly
sensible to many Americans and Europeans. Yet it's a proven fact that
most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into
a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their
lives simply because they were born into a poor family.

Unfortunately, [complex human societies seem to require imagined
hierarchies and unjust discrimination. Of course not all hierarchies are
morally identical, and some societies suffered from more extreme types
of discrimination than others]{.underline}, yet scholars know of no
large society that has been able to dispense with discrimination
altogether. Time and again people have created order in their societies
by classifying the population into imagined categories, such as
superiors, commoners and slaves; whites and blacks; patricians and
plebeians; Brahmins and Shudras; or rich and poor. These categories have
regulated relations between millions of humans by making some people
legally, politically or socially superior to others.

Hierarchies serve an important function. They enable complete strangers
to know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy
needed to become personally acquainted. In George Bernard Shaw's
Pygmalion, Henry Higgins doesn't need to establish an intimate
acquaintance with Eliza Doolittle in order to understand how he should
relate to her. Just hearing her talk tells him that she is a member of
the underclass with whom he can do as he wishes -- for example, using
her as a pawn in his bet to pass off a jower girl as a duchess. A modern
Eliza working at a jorist's needs to know how much effort to put into
selling roses and gladioli to the dozens of people who enter the shop
each day. She can't make a detailed enquiry into the tastes and wallets
of each individual.

Instead, she uses social cues -- the way the person is dressed, his or
her age, and if she's not politically correct his skin colour. That is
how she immediately distinguishes between the accounting-firm partner
who's likely to place a large order for expensive roses, and a messenger
boy who can only afford a bunch of daisies.

Of course, differences in natural abilities also play a role in the
formation of social distinctions. But such diversities of aptitudes and
character are usually mediated through imagined hierarchies. This
happens in two important ways. First and foremost, most abilities have
to be nurtured and developed. Even if somebody is born with a particular
talent, that talent will usually remain latent if it is not fostered,
honed and exercised. Not all people get the same chance to cultivate and
refine their abilities. Whether or not they have such an opportunity
will usually depend on their place within their society's imagined
hierarchy. Harry Potter is a good example. Removed from his
distinguished wizard family and brought up by ignorant muggles, he
arrives at Hogwarts without any experience in magic. It takes him seven
books to gain a firm command of his powers and knowledge of his unique
abilities.

[Second, even if people belonging to different classes develop exactly
the same abilities, they are unlikely to enjoy equal success because
they will have to play the game by different rules]{.underline}. If, in
British-ruled India, an Untouchable, a Brahmin, a Catholic Irishman and
a Protestant Englishman had somehow developed exactly the same business
acumen, they still would not have had the same chance of becoming rich.
The economic game was rigged by legal restrictions and unoɽcial glass
ceilings.

The Vicious Circle

[All societies are based on imagined hierarchies, but not necessarily on
the same hierarchies.]{.underline} [What accounts for the differences?
Why did traditional Indian society classify people according to caste,
Ottoman society according to religion, and American society according to
race]{.underline}? [In most cases the hierarchy originated as the result
of a set of accidental historical]{.underline}
[circumstances]{.underline} and was then perpetuated and refined over
many generations as different groups developed vested interests in it.

For instance, many scholars surmise that the Hindu caste system took
shape when Indo-Aryan people invaded the Indian subcontinent about 3,000
years ago, subjugating the local population. The invaders established a
stratified society, in which they -- of course -- occupied the leading
positions (priests and warriors), leaving the natives to live as
servants and slaves. The invaders, who were few in number, feared losing
their privileged status and unique identity. To forestall this danger,
they divided the population into castes, each of which was required to
pursue a specific occupation or perform a specific role in society. Each
had different legal status, privileges and duties. Mixing of castes --
social interaction, marriage, even the sharing of meals -- was
prohibited. And the distinctions were not just legal -- they became an
inherent part of religious mythology and practice.

The rulers argued that the caste system rejected an eternal cosmic
reality rather than a chance historical development. Concepts of purity
and impurity were essential elements in Hindu religion, and they were
harnessed to buttress the social pyramid. Pious Hindus were taught that
contact with members of a different caste could pollute not only them
personally, but society as a whole, and should therefore be abhorred.
Such ideas are hardly unique to Hindus. Throughout history, and in
almost all societies, concepts of pollution and purity have played a
leading role in enforcing social and political divisions and have been
exploited by numerous ruling classes to maintain their privileges. The
fear of pollution is not a complete fabrication of priests and princes,
however. It probably has its roots in biological survival mechanisms
that make humans feel an instinctive revulsion towards potential disease
carriers, such as sick persons and dead bodies. If you want to keep any
human group isolated -- women, Jews, Roma, gays, blacks -- the best way
to do it is convince everyone that these people are a source of
pollution.

[[The Hindu caste system]{.mark} and its attendant laws of purity
[became deeply embedded in Indian culture]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Long
after the Indo-Aryan invasion was forgotten, Indians continued to
believe in the caste system and to abhor the pollution caused by caste
mixing]{.underline}. Castes were not immune to change. In fact, as time
went by, large castes were divided into sub-castes. [Eventually the
original four castes turned into 3,000 different groupings called
jati]{.underline} (literally 'birth'). [But this proliferation of castes
did not change the basic principle of the system, according to which
every person is born into a particular rank]{.underline}, and any
infringement of its rules pollutes the person and society as a whole. A
persons jati determines her profession, the food she can eat, her place
of residence and her eligible marriage partners. Usually a person can
marry only within his or her caste, and the resulting children inherit
that status.

[Whenever a new profession developed or a new group of [people]{.mark}
appeared on the scene, they had to be recognised as a caste in order to
receive a legitimate place within Hindu society]{.underline}. Groups
that failed to win recognition as a caste were, literally, outcasts --
in this stratified society, they did not even occupy the lowest rung.
They became known as Untouchables. They had to live apart from all other
people and scrape together a living in humiliating and disgusting ways,
such as sifting through garbage dumps for scrap material. Even members
of the lowest caste avoided mingling with them, eating with them,
touching them and certainly marrying them. [[In]{.mark} modern
[India]{.mark}, matters of marriage and work [are still heavily
influenced by]{.mark} the [caste]{.mark} system, despite all attempts by
the democratic government of India to break down such distinctions and
convince Hindus that there is nothing polluting in caste
mixing]{.underline}.3

Purity in America

**[[A similar vicious circle perpetuated]{.mark} the [racial hierarchy
in]{.mark} modern [America]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [From the sixteenth
to the eighteenth century, the [European]{.mark} conqueror[s]{.mark}
imported millions of African slaves to work the mines and plantations of
America]{.underline}. [They [chose to import slaves from Africa]{.mark}
rather than from Europe or East Asia due to three circumstantial
factors.]{.underline} Firstly, [[Africa was closer]{.mark}, [so it was
cheaper]{.mark} to import slaves from Senegal than from
Vietnam.]{.underline}

Secondly, **[in Africa [there]{.mark} already [existed a well-developed
slave trade]{.mark}]{.underline}** ([exporting slaves mainly to [the
Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}[), **[whereas in Europe slavery was
very rare]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[It was]{.mark} obviously **[far
easier to buy slaves in an existing market]{.mark}** than to create a
new one from scratch]{.underline}.

Thirdly, and [most importantly, [American
plantations]{.mark}]{.underline} in places such as Virginia, Haiti and
Brazil [[were plagued by malaria]{.mark} and yellow fever, which had
originated in Africa]{.underline}. [[Africans had acquired]{.mark} over
the generations a [partial genetic immunity]{.mark} to these diseases,
[whereas **Europeans**]{.mark} **were totally defenceless and [died in
droves]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[It was consequently wiser for a plantation owner to invest his money in
an African slave than in a European slave]{.underline} or indentured
labourer. [Paradoxically, genetic superiority]{.underline} (in terms of
immunity) [translated into social inferiority: precisely because
Africans were fitter in tropical climates than Europeans, they ended up
as the slaves of European masters]{.underline}! [**[Due to these]{.mark}
[circumstantial factors]{.mark}**, the [burgeoning]{.mark} new
[societies]{.mark} of America]{.underline} [[were]{.mark} to be
[divided]{.mark} into a ruling caste of white Europeans and a
**subjugated caste of black Africans**.]{.underline}

But people don't like to say that they keep slaves of a certain race or
origin simply because it's economically expedient. **[[Like]{.mark} the
[Aryan conquerors of India, white Europeans in the Americas wanted to
be]{.mark} [seen]{.mark}]{.underline}** not only as economically
successful but also **[[as]{.mark} pious, [just]{.mark} and
objective]{.underline}**. [Religious and scientific [myths were pressed
into service to justify this]{.mark} division]{.underline}. [Theologians
argued that Africans descend from]{.underline} [Ham]{.underline}, son of
Noah, saddled by his father with a curse that his offspring would be
slaves. [Biologists argued that blacks are less intelligent than whites
and their moral sense less developed]{.underline}. Doctors alleged that
blacks live in filth and spread diseases -- in other words, they are a
source of pollution.

[[These]{.mark} myths [struck a chord in]{.mark} American culture, and
in [Western culture]{.mark} generally]{.underline}. [They continued to
exert their influence long after the conditions that created slavery had
disappeared]{.underline}. In the early nineteenth century imperial
Britain outlawed slavery and stopped the Atlantic slave trade, and in
the decades that followed slavery was gradually outlawed throughout the
American continent.

Notably, this was the first and only time in history that slaveholding
societies voluntarily abolished slavery. But, even though the slaves
were freed, the racist myths that justified slavery persisted.
[[Separation]{.mark} of the races [was maintained by **racist
legislation and social custom**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The result was a **self-reinforcing cycle of cause and
effect**]{.mark}, **a vicious circle.**]{.underline}

Consider, for example, the southern United States immediately after the
Civil War. In 1865 the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution
outlawed slavery and the Fourteenth Amendment mandated that citizenship
and the equal protection of the law could not be denied on the basis of
race. However, two centuries of slavery meant that most black families
were far poorer and far less educated than most white families. A black
person born in Alabama in 1865 thus had much less chance of getting a
good education and a well-paid job than did his white neighbours. His
children, born in the 1880S and 1890s, started life with the same
disadvantage -- they, too, were born to an uneducated, poor family.

But **[economic disadvantage was not the whole story]{.underline}**.
[Alabama was also home to many poor whites who lacked the opportunities
available to their better-off racial brothers and sisters]{.underline}.
In addition, the Industrial Revolution and the waves of immigration made
the United States an extremely fluid society, where rags could quickly
turn into riches. [If money was all that mattered, the sharp divide
between the races should soon have blurred, not least through
intermarriage.]{.underline}

But that did not happen. By 1865 [whites, as well as many blacks, took
it to be a simple matter of fact that blacks were less
intelligent]{.underline}, more violent and sexually dissolute, lazier
and less concerned about personal cleanliness than whites. They were
thus the agents of violence, theft, rape and disease -- in other words,
pollution. If a black Alabaman in 1895 miraculously managed to get a
good education and then applied for a respectable job such as a bank
teller, his odds of being accepted were far worse than those of an
equally qualified white candidate. [The stigma that labelled blacks as,
by nature, unreliable, lazy and less intelligent conspired against
him.]{.underline}

You might think that people would gradually understand that these
stigmas were myth rather than fact and that blacks would be able, over
time, to prove themselves just as competent, law-abiding and clean as
whites. In fact, the opposite happened -- [these [prejudices became
**more**]{.mark} **and more [entrenched as time went by]{.mark}**.
[Since all the best jobs were held by whites]{.mark}, [it became easier
to believe that blacks really are inferior]{.mark}. 'Look,' said the
average white citizen, 'blacks have been free for generations, yet there
are almost no black professors, lawyers, doctors or even bank tellers.
Isn't that proof that blacks are simply less intelligent and
hard-working?]{.underline}' [Trapped in this vicious circle, blacks were
not hired for whitecollar jobs because they were deemed unintelligent,
and the proof of their inferiority was the paucity of blacks in
white-collar jobs.]{.underline}

The vicious circle did not stop there. [**[As anti-black stigmas grew
stronger]{.mark}, [they were translated into]{.mark} a system of '[Jim
Crow']{.mark} [laws]{.mark} and norms** that were meant to safeguard the
racial order]{.underline}. [Blacks were forbidden to vote in elections,
to study in white schools, to buy in white stores, to eat in white
restaurants, to sleep in white hotels.]{.underline} The justification
for all of this was that blacks were foul, slothful and vicious, so
whites had to be protected from them. Whites did not want to sleep in
the same hotel as blacks or to eat in the same restaurant, for fear of
diseases. They did not want their children learning in the same school
as black children, for fear of brutality and bad influences. They did
not want blacks voting in elections, since blacks were ignorant and
immoral. These fears were substantiated by scientific studies that
'proved' that blacks were indeed less educated, that various diseases
were more common among them, and that their crime rate was far higher
(the studies ignored the fact that these 'facts' resulted from
discrimination against blacks).

[By the mid-twentieth century, segregation in the former Confederate
states was probably worse than in the late nineteenth
century.]{.underline} Clennon King, a black student who applied to the
University of Mississippi in 1958, was forcefully committed to a mental
asylum. The presiding judge ruled that a black person must surely be
insane to think that he could be admitted to the University of
Mississippi.

The vicious circle: a chance historical situation is translated into a
rigid social system.

Nothing was as revolting to American southerners (and many northerners)
as sexual relations and marriage between black men and white women. Sex
between the races became the greatest taboo and any violation, or
suspected violation, was viewed as deserving immediate and summary
punishment in the form of lynching. The Ku Klux Klan, a white
supremacist secret society, perpetrated many such killings. They could
have taught the Hindu Brahmins a thing or two about purity laws.

[With time, the racism spread to more and more cultural
arenas]{.underline}. **[American aesthetic culture was built around
white standards of beauty]{.underline}**. The physical attributes of the
white race -- for example light skin, fair and straight hair, a small
upturned nose -- came to be identified as beautiful. Typical black
features -- dark skin, dark and bushy hair, a flattened nose -- were
deemed ugly. These preconceptions ingrained the imagined hierarchy at an
even deeper level of human consciousness.

[[Such vicious circles can go on for]{.mark} centuries and even
[millennia]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[perpetuating an imagined hierarchy
that sprang from a chance historical occurrence]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Unjust discrimination often gets worse, not better, with time. [Money
comes to money, and poverty to poverty. Education comes to education,
and ignorance to ignorance. Those once victimised by history are likely
to be victimised yet again. And those whom history has privileged are
more likely to be privileged again]{.underline}.

Most **[[sociopolitical hierarchies]{.mark} lack a logical or biological
basis]{.underline}** -- [they [are nothing but the perpetuation of
chance events supported by myths]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[That is one
good reason to study history]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [If the division
into blacks and whites or Brahmins and Shudras was grounded in
biological realities]{.underline} -- that is, if Brahmins really had
better brains than Shudras -- biology would be sufficient for
understanding human society. Since the biological distinctions between
different groups of Homo sapiens are, in fact, negligible, biology can't
explain the intricacies of Indian society or American racial dynamics.
**[[We can only understand those]{.mark} phenomena [by studying
the]{.mark} events, [circumstances]{.mark}, and power relations [that
transformed figments of imagination into cruel]{.mark}]{.underline}** --
and very real -- **[[social]{.mark} [structures]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[Humans are liable to treat entire categories of other humans as means
to an end or nuisances to be cast aside.]{.underline} Coalitions bound
by race or creed seek to dominate rival coalitions. Men try to control
the labor, freedom, and sexuality of women.1 People translate their
discomfort with sexual nonconformity into moralistic condemnation.2 [We
call these phenomena racism, sexism, and homophobia, and they have been
rampant, to varying degrees, in most cultures throughout
history.]{.underline} The disavowal of these evils is a large part of
what we call civil rights or equal rights. [The historical expansion of
these rights---the stories of Selma, Seneca Falls, and Stonewall---is a
stirring chapter in the story of human progress.]{.underline}3 [The
rights of racial minorities, women, and gay people continue to advance,
each recently emblazoned on a milestone.]{.underline} The year 2017 saw
the completion of two terms in office by the first African American
president, an achievement movingly captured by First Lady Michelle Obama
in a speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2016: "I wake up
every morning in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my
daughters, two beautiful, intelligent black young women, playing with
their dogs on the White House lawn." [Barack Obama was succeeded by the
first woman nominee of a major party in a presidential election, less
than a century after American women were even allowed to vote; she won a
solid plurality of the popular vote and would have been president were
it not for peculiarities of the Electoral College system]{.underline}
and other quirks of that election year. [In a parallel universe very
similar to this one until November 8, 2016, the world's three most
influential nations]{.underline} (the United States, the United Kingdom,
and Germany) [are all led by women.]{.underline}4 And [in 2015, just a
dozen years after it ruled that homosexual activity may not be
criminalized, the Supreme Court guaranteed the right of marriage to
same-sex couples. But [it's in the nature of progress that]{.mark} it
erases its tracks, and [its champions fixate on the remaining injustices
and forget how far we have come.]{.mark} An axiom of progressive
opinion, especially in universities, is that [we continue to live in a
deeply racist, sexist, and homophobic society]{.mark}---which would
imply that progressivism is a waste of time, having accomplished nothing
after decades of struggle. [Like other forms of progressophobia, the
denial of advances]{.mark} in rights [has been abetted by sensational
headlines.]{.mark} A string of highly publicized killings by American
police officers of unarmed African American suspects, some of them
caught on smartphone videos, has led to a sense that the country is
suffering an epidemic of racist attacks by police on black
men.]{.underline} Media coverage of athletes who have assaulted their
wives or girlfriends, and of episodes of rape on college campuses, has
suggested to many that we are undergoing a surge of violence against
women. And [one of the most heinous crimes in American history took
place in 2016 when Omar Mateen opened fire at a gay nightclub in
Orlando, killing forty-nine people and wounding another fifty-three. The
belief in an absence of progress has been [fortified by the recent
history of the universe]{.mark} we do live in, [where Donald
Trump]{.mark} rather than Hillary Clinton [was the beneficiary of
the]{.mark} American [electoral system]{.mark} in 2016.]{.underline}
During his campaign, Trump uttered misogynistic, anti-Hispanic, and
anti-Muslim insults that were well outside the norms of American
political discourse, and the rowdy followers he encouraged at his
rallies were even more offensive. [Some commentators worried that his
victory represented a turning point in the nation's progress toward
equality and rights, or that it uncovered the ugly truth that we had
never made progress in the first place. The goal of this chapter is to
plumb the depths]{.underline} of the current that carries equal rights
along. Is it an illusion, a turbulent whirlpool atop a stagnant pond?
Does it easily change direction and flow backwards? Or does justice roll
on like a river, righteousness like a mighty stream? I'll end with a
coda about progress in the rights of the most easily victimized sector
of humanity, children. By now you should be skeptical about reading
history from the headlines, and that applies to the recent assaults on
equal rights. The data suggest that the number of police shootings has
decreased, not increased, in recent decades (even as the ones that do
occur are captured on video), and three independent analyses have found
that a black suspect is no more likely than a white suspect to be killed
by the police.6 (American police shoot too many people, but it's not
primarily a racial issue.) A spate of news about rape cannot tell us
whether there is now more violence against women, a bad thing, or
whether we now care more about violence against women, a good thing. And
to this day it is unclear whether the Orlando nightclub massacre was
committed out of homophobia, sympathy for ISIS, or the drive for
posthumous notoriety that motivates most rampage shooters. Better first
drafts of history can be gleaned from data on values and from vital
statistics. [[The Pew Research Center has probed Americans' opinions on
race, gender, and sexual orientation]{.mark} over the past quarter
century, [and has reported that these attitudes have undergone a
"fundamental shift" toward tolerance]{.mark} and respect of rights,
[with]{.mark} formerly widespread [prejudices sinking into
oblivion.]{.mark}]{.underline}7 The shift is visible in figure 15-1,
which plots reactions to three survey statements that are representative
of many others. [Other surveys show the same shifts.]{.underline}8 [Not
only has the American population become more liberal, but [each
generational cohort is more liberal than the one born before
it]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 As we will see, [people tend to carry their
values with them as they age, so the Millennials]{.underline} (those
born after 1980), [who are even less prejudiced than the national
average, tell us which way the country is going.]{.underline}10 Of
course [one can wonder whether figure 15-1 displays a decline in
prejudice or simply a decline in the social acceptability of prejudice,
with fewer people willing to confess their disreputable attitudes to a
pollster. The problem has long haunted social scientists, but recently
the economist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz has discovered an indicator of
attitudes that is the closest we've come to a digital truth
serum.]{.underline}11 In the privacy of their keyboards and screens,
[people query Google with every curiosity, anxiety, and guilty

together with tools for analyzing them. Stephens-Davidowitz [discovered
that [searches]{.mark}]{.underline} for the \[n word\] (mostly in
pursuit of racist jokes) [[correlate with]{.mark} other indicators of
racial prejudice across regions, such as vote totals for Barack Obama in
2008 that were lower than expected for a Democrat.]{.underline}12 He
suggests that [these searches can serve as an unobtrusive indicator of
[private racism.]{.mark}]{.underline} Let's use them to track recent
trends in racism, and while we're at it, private sexism and homophobia
as well. Well into my adolescence, jokes featuring dumb Poles, ditzy
dames, and lisping, limp-wristed homosexuals were common in network
television and newspaper comics. Today they are taboo in mainstream
media. But do bigoted jokes remain a private indulgence, or have private
attitudes changed so much that people feel offended, sullied, or bored
by them? Figure 15-2 shows the results. The [[curves suggest that
Americans are not just more abashed about confessing]{.mark} to
prejudice than they used to be[; they privately don't find it]{.mark} as
[amusing.]{.mark}]{.underline}13 And contrary to the fear that the rise
of Trump reflects (or emboldens) prejudice, the curves continue their
decline through his period of notoriety in 2015--2016 and inauguration
in early 2017. [Stephens-Davidowitz has pointed out to me that
[these]{.mark} curves [probably underestimate the decline]{.mark} in
prejudice [because of]{.mark} a shift in [who's
Googling.]{.mark}]{.underline} When the records began in 2004, Googlers
were mostly young and urban. [Older and rural people tend to be
latecomers to technology, and if they are the ones who are likelier to
search for the offensive terms, that would inflate the proportion in
later years and conceal the extent of the decline in
bigotry.]{.underline} Google doesn't record the searchers' ages or
levels of education, but it does record where the searches where the
searches come from. In response to my query, Stephens-Davidowitz
confirmed that bigoted searches tended to come from regions with older
and less-educated populations. Compared with the country as a whole,
retirement communities are seven times as likely to search for "\[n
word\] jokes" and thirty times as likely to search for "\[f\*g\] jokes."
("Google AdWords," he told me apologetically, "doesn't give data on '\[b
word\] jokes.'") Stephens-Davidowitz [also got his hands on a trove of
search data from AOL, which, unlike Google, tracks the searches made by
individuals]{.underline} (though not, of course, their identities).
[These threads confirmed that racists may be a dwindling
breed]{.underline}: someone who searches for "\[n word\]" is likely to
search for other topics that appeal to senior citizens, such as "social
security" and "Frank Sinatra." The main exception was a sliver of
teenagers who also searched for bestiality, decapitation videos, and
child pornography---anything you're not supposed to search for. But
aside from these transgressive youths (and there have always been
transgressive youths), private prejudice is [declining with time and
declining with youth, which means that we can expect it to decline still
further as aging bigots cede the stage to less prejudiced
cohorts.]{.underline} Until they do, these older and less-educated
people (mainly white men) may not respect the benign taboos on racism,
sexism, and homophobia that have become second nature to the mainstream,
and may even dismiss them as "political correctness." Today they can
find each other on the Internet and coalesce under a demagogue. As we
will see in chapter 20, [[Trump's success]{.mark}, like that of
right-wing populists in other Western countries, [is better understood
as the mobilization of an aggrieved and shrinking demographic]{.mark} in
a polarized political landscape [than as the sudden reversal of a
century-long movement]{.mark} toward equal rights. Progress in equal
rights may be seen not just in political milestones and opinion
bellwethers but in data on people's lives. Among [African
American]{.mark}s, the [poverty rate fell from 55]{.mark} percent in
1960 [to 27.6]{.mark} percent]{.underline} in 2011.14 [[Life expectancy
rose from 33]{.mark} in 1900 (17.6 years below that of whites) [to
75.6]{.mark} years in 2015]{.underline} (less than 3 years below
whites).15 African Americans who make it to 65 have longer lives ahead
of them than white Americans of the same age. [The rate of [illiteracy
fell]{.mark} among African Americans [from 45]{.mark} percent in 1900
[to effectively zero]{.mark} percent today.]{.underline}16 As we will
see in the next chapter, the [[racial gap in]{.mark} children's
readiness for [school has been shrinking.]{.mark}]{.underline} As we
will see in chapter 18, [[so has]{.mark} the racial [gap in
happiness.]{.mark}]{.underline}17 [[Racist violence]{.mark} against
African Americans, [once a regular occurrence in night raids and
lynchings]{.mark}]{.underline} (three a week at the turn of the 20th
century), [[plummeted in the 20th century]{.mark}, and has fallen
further since the FBI started amalgamating reports]{.underline} on hate
crimes in 1996, as figure 15-1 shows. (Very few of these crimes are
homicides, in most years one or zero.)18 [The slight uptick in
2015]{.underline} (the most recent year available) [cannot be blamed on
Trump, since it parallels the uptick in violent crime that
year]{.underline} (see figure 12-2), and hate crimes track rates of
overall lawlessness more closely than they do remarks by politicians.19
Figure 15-3 shows that hate crimes against Asian, Jewish, and white
targets have declined as well. And despite claims that Islamophobia has
become rampant in America, hate crimes targeting Muslims have shown
little change other than a one-time rise following 9/11 and upticks
following other Islamist terror attacks, such as the ones in Paris and
San Bernardino in 2015.20 At the time of this writing, FBI data from
2016 are not available, so [it's premature to accept the widespread
claims of a Trumpist surge in hate crimes that year. The claims come
from advocacy organizations, whose funding depends on whipping up fear,
rather than disinterested recordkeepers; some of the incidents were
ironic hoaxes, and many were boorish outbursts rather than actual
crimes.]{.underline}21

**Protests that harness the state have been able to materially reduce
police violence in Ferguson**

**Liu 14** \[Eric, "Time to turn protests into change," CNN, December 4,
2014,
<http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/03/opinion/liu-meaning-ferguson-protests>\]

More than a week after the grand jury\'s decision in Ferguson,
[[protests continue nationwide]{.underline}.]{.mark} [On
campuses]{.underline}, in [malls]{.underline}, on [streets
and]{.underline} in [stadiums]{.underline}, [Americans]{.underline}
young and old [are voicing]{.underline} their [anger about]{.underline}
the [non-indictments in the deaths of]{.underline} Michael [Brown
and]{.underline} now Eric [Garner]{.underline} in New York \-- and about
the rigged system that makes such results all too common. [[This
prolif]{.mark}eration [of protests is good. But]{.mark} it\'s **[not
good enough]{.mark}**.]{.underline} First, let\'s reflect a bit on why
it\'s good. Anytime Americans start seeing themselves as more than mere
consumers or spectators \-- rather, as citizens and participants \--
something healthy is happening. That\'s especially true when people are
willing to flex their citizen muscles during the start of peak shopping
season. So [seeing protesters]{.underline} from Seattle to New York
[engage in civil disobedience]{.underline} on Black Friday [was
heartening]{.underline}. [Did all the walk-outs]{.underline} and
\"die-ins\" [inconvenience some shoppers]{.underline} and deal-seekers?
[Sure]{.underline}. The post-Ferguson moment demands, at a bare minimum,
that we all raise our sights beyond one-day sale tags. [But while the
protests are promising]{.underline} and necessary, **[they are also
insufficient]{.underline}**. [A [deeper]{.mark} phase of [work is
needed]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [here all of [America can learn from
what\'s]{.mark} already [been]{.mark} [happening in
Missouri]{.mark}.]{.underline} The media has tended to focus on the most
eye-catching conflict \-- either daytime marches with famous activists,
or nighttime rioting after the grand jury decision. But off-camera,
people on the ground in and around this community have been doing
something simple and difficult. They\'ve been moving from protest to
power. [Faith groups and [grassroots organizers like **Communities
Creating Opportunity**]{.mark} [and the **Organization for Black
Struggle**]{.mark} have]{.underline}, since this summer, [been [engaging
people in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Ferguson to]{.mark} organize and
advocate for reforms, to r[egister]{.mark}, to [vote]{.mark}, to
[understand]{.mark} the makeup and the **[methods of]{.mark} the city
council** and the [state legislature]{.mark}]{.underline}. In short[,
**[to do politics]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [This may seem unsatisfying to
some, even irrelevant. [The]{.mark} members of the [millennial
generation]{.mark} who are [driving]{.mark} so many of the
[protests]{.mark} today [are]{.mark} idealistic and
networked]{.underline} \-- [**but also [exceedingly cynical]{.mark}**
[about traditional politics and government]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
[young African-American]{.underline}s who are most [often subjected to
arbitrary abuses]{.underline} by the criminal justice system [have the
**most reason** to be mistrustful of the larger political machinery that
begat that system]{.underline}. But [what the grassroots
organizers]{.underline} in Ferguson [teach]{.underline} us **[is that
there is no avoiding politics]{.underline}**. Indeed, [[there is no way
to achieve any **scaled and durable reform**]{.mark} [without stepping
into the arena of **government**, **policy**,]{.mark} **politics**, and
**elections**]{.underline}. [[A change in **city council
representation** can lead to a change in how]{.mark} truly
[representative]{.mark} [one\'s police force is]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[A]{.underline} ]{.mark}[**well-coordinated campaign** to let elected
officials know you are part of a **collective with voice**, **clout**,
**savvy**, and **votes** can lead to a change in attitude among those
elected]{.underline} \-- **[and then to changes in
policy]{.underline}**. [What [this requires]{.mark} is an
[**understanding of the institutions**]{.mark} that govern how we govern
ourselves]{.underline}. [What [it]{.mark} [requires]{.mark} is
**[literacy in civic power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is why the
organization I run, Citizen University, is working with partners around
the country to **[[teach people about the skills and systems of
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And **[it\'s why everyone]{.underline}**,
left or right \-- and especially those living on the front lines of
racial disparity and violent inequity \-- **[must learn how to read and
to write power]{.underline}**. Wherever you live, ask yourself: [Could I
teach someone what the activists in Ferguson are teaching people now?
Could I teach them how my city makes policy, how politicians respond to
public pressure, how to navigate the rules of voting, how to make votes
cancel out money?]{.underline} All around the world, [from Tahrir
Square]{.underline} a few years ago [to Hong Kong]{.underline} today,
[we see young people caught up in what one journalist called \"the
euphoria of defiance]{.underline}.\" Alas, [in most of those situations,
we also see what happens when [protesters are **unable to convert civil
disobedience into civil self-rule**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
**[[That]{.mark} [requires strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It requires
**[[organization]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It requires **[[patient
instruction]{.underline}]{.mark}** in citizenship. Fifty-nine years ago
this week, Rosa Parks made a heroic choice not to sit at the back of the
bus. But what her story teaches us is this: Heroes are what happens when
a moment calls forth people well prepared by institutions. [Parks did
not arrive randomly]{.underline} at that occasion on that bus. [She had
been groomed by an ecosystem of civil rights groups l]{.underline}ike
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, [trained
at places like the Highlander Folk School. She had understood her
choice]{.underline} \-- her immovable defiance \-- [to be part of a
larger story]{.underline} and a methodical strategy for the attainment
of power. [This is what unsung but undaunted citizen organizers and
educators are doing in Ferguson today.]{.underline} They\'ve moved past
\"Hands Up, Don\'t Shoot\" gestures. [They are getting hands-on about
changing their community. And so should we all. That\'s how we can make
this a **season of powerful citizenship**]{.underline}.

proves**

Evidence that Implicit Biases Are Malleable¶ [[Scientists have]{.mark}
developed a body of [empirical evidence]{.mark} that [implicit biases
are **malleable**]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past quarter century.
[The empirical record is now well established and offers **strong
evidence**]{.underline} [that implicit attitudes are [neither
**inaccessible** nor **inescapable**]{.mark}; they are [not impossible
to control]{.mark}; they are not out of reach.]{.underline} In fact,
implicit associations can be influenced both by the individual who
unconsciously holds these stereotypes and prejudices and by external
factors. Researchers have reported and reviewed numerous studies that
put two important misconceptions about implicit biases to rest. First,
[the evidence demonstrates that unconscious [implicit attitudes are
responsive to]{.mark} the **[deliberate choices]{.mark} and influences
of an individual**]{.underline} [even though that person is not
consciously experiencing the bias.]{.underline} Second, [implicit biases
are not impervious to relatively short-term change even though they
arise from social knowledge that was acquired slowly]{.underline}, and
over a lifetime. In fact, [the evidence reveals that learning can
continue to take place and alter social group knowledge]{.underline},
after initial attitudes and associations are formed. Take, for example,
a person who developed bad driving habits over time and subconsciously
incorporated those habits into driving behavior for many years. If this
person chooses to be mindful of improving his or her driving, either out
of a conscious decision to do so or in response to external influences,
those bad habits can be altered. External authorities may incentivize
improvement through a media campaign, new rules of the road, prosecution
for reckless driving, or a driver\'s education class. Thus,
[malleability describes an ongoing learning process in which [people
with]{.mark} old, objectionable implicit [biases]{.mark} learn to
[respond to newer]{.mark}, more appropriate [attitudes]{.mark} and
beliefs]{.underline}. Put another way, longstanding and [**[unconscious
thinking can change]{.mark}.¶** This]{.underline} understanding of
[malleability is called the "connectionist\" model of implicit
bias]{.underline}. Unlike the prior notion that implicit associations
are static and inaccessibly fixed, [the empirical record reveals that
[stereotypes]{.mark} and prejudicial beliefs to which we may adhere at
any given time [are "states" of thinking]{.mark} that form [based on
past **experiences**]{.mark} and current **inputs**]{.underline}.
[[Biases can be **revised**]{.underline}]{.mark} [depending upon current
informational inputs gathered and weighed with each new encounter.
[This]{.mark} flexible [view]{.mark} of stereotyping [replaces an
**outdated rigid one**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and allows for the evidence
that [individuals can]{.mark} constantly **[update]{.mark} the stored
[group knowledge]{.mark}** that produces implicit biases.]{.underline}
The connectionist model ex. plains that a stereotype is merely a pattern
of activation that, at a given point in time, is jointly determined by
current input (i.e., the context) and the weight of the new
information's connection to existing and underlying beliefs.
Psychologists now conclude that "stereotypes are quite elastic and thus
any individual could hold and even change an infinite number of
representations of social category\'s members, when viewed across time
and place?"¶ [The connectionist model contrasts with early theories of
implicit bias, which focused on their **automaticity**]{.underline}.
'Automaticity\' refers generally to the way that individuals make
associations without any awareness, without intentionality, and without
responsibility for the influence the associations have in directing
their conduct and choices." [[Early researchers concluded]{.mark} that
automaticity meant [inevitability]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, one
researcher said, "a crucial component of automatic pro\~ ceases is their
inescapability; they occur despite deliberate attempts to bypass or
ignore them."7 **[[This]{.mark} view [is no longer
correct]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Over the past twenty years. researchers
have collected a strong record to contradict this notion that implicit
attitudes change slowly, if at all, simply because they develop slowly
over time. This idea has been replaced by what Dr. Irene Blair has
called "the now-bountiful evidence that [automatic [attitudes]{.mark}
and self-reported attitudes-\~**[are sensitive to personal, social, and
situational pressures]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" Blair points out that
"[the conclusion that automatic stereotypes and prejudice are not as
inflexible as previously assumed is strengthened by the number and
variety of demonstrations]{.underline}. . . . The fact that the tests
were conducted in the service of many different goals, and by the
similarity of findings across different measmres.\"9¶ The importance of
understanding that implicit biases are malleable cannot be overstated.
First, [malleability means that [interventions may be **strategically
introduced**]{.mark} to provide current inputs that alter implicit
biases]{.underline}. Thus[, we can expect that implicit biases can be
reduced]{.underline}. To say that biased attitudes may be "reduced" is
to say that current informational inputs can be adjusted so that the
resulting stereotype patterns to longer conform to traditional,
discriminatory, or inequitable stereotypes, but instead lead individuals
and institutions to more equitable judgments and more equitable conduct.
Furthermore, [malleability also leans that the discriminatory impacts
that result from implicit biases so maybe reduced]{.underline}. The
research that gave rise to the connectionist mode has provided important
insights concerning the several methods available to individuals and
institutions wishing to ameliorate the discriminatory impact of
decisions and conduct informed by imme biases, stereotyping, and
prejudice. Finally, [by demonstrating that even [subconscious **racial**
biases **are within reach** ]{.mark}**and control**, researchers have
provided a sound basis for holding individuals and **institutions**
responsible for reducing implicit racial and ethnic biases and for
reducing the discriminatory harms caused by unconscious
racism.]{.underline}

**Antiblackness is** [socialized]{.underline}**, not a libidinal and
universal drive**

[Fanon]{.underline}'s vantage point upon the world is his situated
experience. He [is trying to understand the]{.underline} inner [psychic
life of racism, not provide an account of the structure of human
existence]{.underline} as a whole. [[Racism is
**not**]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[an **integral** part of
the]{.mark} human [psyche]{.mark}; it is a Social construct that has a
psychic impact. [Any]{.mark} effort to comprehend]{.underline} social
distress that accompanies [racism by [reference to]{.mark} some [a
priori]{.mark} structure---be it]{.underline} the [Oedipal]{.underline}
Complex [or the [Collective Unconscious---is **doomed**]{.mark} to
failure]{.underline}. \[END PAGE 35\]¶ Carl [Jung sought to]{.underline}
deepen and [go beyond Freud\'s approach by arguing that the subconscious
is grounded in a universal layer of the psyche---which he called "the
collective unconscious." This refers to inherited patterns of thought
that exist in all human minds, regardless of specific culture or
upbringing]{.underline}, and which manifest themselves in dreams, fairy
tales, and myths. Jung referred to these universal patterns as
"archetypes." It may seem, on a superficial reading, that Fanon is
drawing from Jung, since he discusses how white people tend to
unconsciously assimilate views of blacks that are based on negative
stereotypes. Even the most "progressive" white tends to think of blacks
a certain way (such as "emotional," "physical," or "aggressive"), even
as they disavow any racist animus on their part. However, [[Fanon
denies]{.mark} that such [collective delusions are part of a psychic
structure; they **are not permanent**]{.mark} features of the mind.
[They are habits acquired from]{.mark} a series of [social and cultural
impositions]{.mark}. While they constitute a kind a collective
unconscious on the part of many white people, they are [not grounded in
any]{.mark} universal ["archetype."]{.mark}]{.underline} The unconscious
prejudices of whites do not derive from genes or nature, nor do they
derive from some form independent of culture or upbringing. [Fanon
contends that [Jung "confuses habit with
instinct]{.mark}."]{.underline}21¶ [Fanon objects to]{.underline} Jung's
["collective unconscious" for the same reason that he rejects the notion
of a black ontology. His phenomenological approach brackets out
ontological claims on both a social and psychological level insofar as
the examination of race and racism is concerned]{.underline}. He writes,
"Neither Freud nor Adler nor even the cosmic Jung took the black man
into consideration in the course of his research."22¶ This does not mean
that Fanon rejects their contributions tout court. He does not deny the
existence of the unconscious. He only denies that the inferiority
complex of blacks operates on an unconscious level. He does not reject
the Oedipal Complex. He only denies that it explains (especially in the
West Indies) the proclivity of the black "slave" to mimic the values of
the white "master." And as seen from his positive remarks on Lacan\'s
theory of the mirror stage, he does not reject the idea of psychic
structure. He only denies that it can substitute for an historical
understanding of the origin of \[END PAGE 36\] neuroses .23 [[Fanon
adopts a socio-genetic approach to a study]{.mark} of the psyche because
that is what is adequate for the object of his analysis]{.underline}.¶
[For Fanon, it is [the relationship between the socio-economic and
psychological]{.mark} that is of critical import. He makes it
clear]{.underline}, insofar as the subject matter of his study is
concerned, that [the socio-economic is first of all responsible for
affective disorders]{.underline}: "First, economic. Then,
internalization or rather epidermalization of this inferiority."24
[Fanon never misses an opportunity to remind us that racism owes its
origin to specific economic relations of domination]{.underline}- [such
as slavery]{.underline}, colonialism, and the effort to coopt sections
of the working class into serving the needs of capital. It is hard to
mistake the Marxist influence here. It does not follow, however, that
what comes first in the order of time has conceptual or strategic
priority. The inferiority complex is originally born from economic
subjugation, but it takes on a life of its own and expresses itself in
terms that surpass the economic. Both sides of the problem-the
socio-economic and psychological-must be combatted in tandem: "The black
man must wage the struggle on two levels; whereas historically these
levels are mutually dependent, any unilateral liberation is flawed, and
the worst mistake would be to believe their mutual dependence
automatic."25¶ On these grounds [he argues that the problem of racism
cannot be solved on a psychological level. It is not an "individual"
problem; it is a social one. But neither can it be solved on a social
level]{.underline} that ores the psychological. It is small wonder that
although his name never appears in the book, Fanon was enamored of the
work of Wilhelm Reich. This important Freudian-Marxist would no doubt
feel affinity with [Fanon\'s comment, "Genuine disalienation will have
been achieved only when things, in the most materialist sense, have
resumed their rightful place."]{.underline}27

[[It would be **easy** to see]{.underline}]{.mark} in all this
[**powerful [evidence]{.mark}** [that racism is]{.mark} a
**[permanent]{.mark} fixture**]{.underline} in America's social fabric
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} even, perhaps, an
**[[inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}** aspect of human nature. Indeed,
the mere act of labeling others according to their age, gender, or race
is a reflexive habit of the human mind. Social categories, like race,
impact our thinking quickly, often outside of our awareness. Extensive
research has found that these implicit racial biases---negative thoughts
and feelings about people from other races---are automatic, pervasive,
and difficult to suppress. [**[Neuroscientists]{.mark}** have also
[explored]{.mark} **racial [prejudice]{.mark}** [by exposing people
to]{.mark}]{.underline} images of faces while scanning their brains in
**[[fMRI]{.mark} machines]{.underline}**. Early studies found that when
people viewed faces of another race, the amount of activity in the
amygdala---a small brain structure associated with experiencing
emotions, including fear---was associated with individual differences on
implicit measures of racial bias. This work has led many to conclude
that racial biases might be part of a primitive---and possibly
hard-wired---neural fear response to racial out-groups.

There is little question that categories such as race, gender, and age
play a major role in shaping the biases and stereotypes that people
bring to bear in their judgments of others. However, research has shown
that how people categorize themselves may be just as fundamental to
understanding prejudice as how they categorize others. When people
categorize themselves as part of a group, their self-concept shifts from
the individual ("I") to the collective level ("us"). People form groups
rapidly and favor members of their own group even when groups are formed
on arbitrary grounds, such as the simple flip of a coin. These findings
highlight the remarkable ease with which humans form coalitions.

Recent **[[research confirms]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
[**[coalition]{.mark}-based preference[s]{.mark}** [trump
**race**]{.mark}**-based preferences**]{.underline}. For example, both
[[**Democrats and Republicans** favor]{.underline}]{.mark} the resumes
of those affiliated with [[their]{.mark} **political
[party]{.mark}**]{.underline} [much [more than]{.mark} they
favor]{.underline} those who share **[their
[race]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These coalition-based preferences remain
powerful even in the absence of the animosity present in electoral
politics. Our research has shown that the simple act of placing people
on a mixed-race team can diminish their automatic racial bias. In a
series of experiments, White participants who were randomly placed on a
mixed-race team---the Tigers or Lions---showed little evidence of
implicit racial bias. [**Merely [belonging]{.mark}** [to a **mixed-race
team** trigged **positive** ]{.mark}**automatic
[associations]{.mark}**]{.underline} with all of the members of their
own group, irrespective of race. Being a part of one of these seemingly
trivial mixed-race groups produced similar effects on brain
activity---[[the **amygdala** responded to **team**]{.mark}
**membership** [rather than **race**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taken
together, these studies indicate that momentary changes in group
membership can override the influence of race on the way we see, think
about, and feel toward people who are different from ourselves.

Although these coalition-based distinctions might be the most basic
building block of bias, they say little about the other factors that
cause group conflict. Why do some groups get ignored while others get
attacked? Whenever we encounter a new person or group we are motivated
to answer two questions as quickly as possible: "is this person a friend
or foe?" and "are they capable of enacting their intentions toward me?"
In other words, once we have determined that someone is a member of an
out-group, we need to determine what kind? The nature of the relations
between groups---are we cooperative, competitive, or neither?---and
their relative status---do you have access to resources?---largely
determine the course of intergroup interactions.

Groups that are seen as competitive with one's interests, and capable of
enacting their nasty intentions, are much more likely to be targets of
hostility than more benevolent (e.g., elderly) or powerless (e.g.,
homeless) groups. This is one reason why sports rivalries have such
psychological potency. For instance, fans of the Boston Red Sox are more
likely to feel pleasure, and exhibit reward-related neural responses, at
the misfortunes of the archrival New York Yankees than other baseball
teams (and vice versa)---especially in the midst of a tight playoff
race. (How much fans take pleasure in the misfortunes of their rivals is
also linked to how likely they would be to harm fans from the other
team.)

Just as a particular person's group membership can be flexible, so too
are the relations between groups. Groups that have previously had
cordial relations may become rivals (and vice versa). Indeed,
[**[psychological]{.mark} and biological** [responses to **out-group**
members]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}can
**[[change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, depending on whether or not that
out-group is perceived as threatening. For example, people exhibit
greater pleasure---they smile---in response to the misfortunes of
stereotypically competitive groups (e.g., investment bankers); however,
this malicious pleasure is reduced when you provide participants with
counter-stereotypic information (e.g., "investment bankers are working
with small companies to help them weather the economic downturn).
Competition between "us" and "them" can even distort our judgments of
distance, making threatening out-groups seem much closer than they
really are. These distorted perceptions can serve to amplify intergroup
discrimination: the more different and distant "they" are, the easier it
is to disrespect and harm them.

Thus, not all out-groups are treated the same: some elicit indifference
whereas others become targets of antipathy. Stereotypically threatening
groups are especially likely to be targeted with violence, but those
[[**stereotypes** can be **tempered** with]{.underline}]{.mark} other
[**[info]{.mark}rmation**[. If]{.mark}]{.underline} perceptions of
intergroup relations can be changed, [[individuals]{.mark} may
**[overcome hostility]{.mark}** toward perceived foes [and
become]{.mark} **more [responsive]{.mark}**]{.underline} to one
another's grievances.

[[The **flexible nature**]{.underline}]{.mark} of both group membership
and intergroup relations [[offers **reason** to be]{.mark} cautiously
[**optimistic** about]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the potential for
greater **[[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** among groups in conflict
(be they black versus white or citizens versus police). One strategy is
to bring multiple groups together around a common goal. For example,
during the fiercely contested 2008 Democratic presidential primary
process, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama supporters gave more money to
strangers who supported the same primary candidate (compared to the
rival candidate). Two months later, after the Democratic National
Convention, the supporters of both candidates coalesced around the party
nominee---Barack Obama---and this bias disappeared. In fact, merely
[[creating]{.underline}]{.mark} a sense of [[cohesion]{.mark} between
two competitive groups [can **increase empathy**]{.mark}]{.underline}
for the suffering of our rivals. These sorts of strategies can [help
**[reduce aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline} toward hostile out-groups,
[[which is **critical** for]{.mark} creating more opportunities for
**constructive [dialogue]{.mark}** [addressing]{.mark} greater **social
[injustices]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Of course, instilling a sense of common identity and cooperation is
extremely difficult in entrenched intergroup conflicts, but when it
happens, the benefits are obvious. Consider how the community leaders in
New York City and Ferguson responded differently to protests against
police brutality---in NYC political leaders expressed grief and concern
over police brutality and moved quickly to make policy changes in
policing, whereas the leaders and police in Ferguson responded with
high-tech military vehicles and riot gear. In the first case, multiple
groups came together with a common goal---to increase the safety of
everyone in the community; in the latter case, the actions of the police
likely reinforced the "us" and "them" distinctions.

Tragically, these types of conflicts continue to roil the country.
Understanding the psychology and neuroscience of social identity and
intergroup relations cannot undo the effects of systemic racism and
discriminatory practices; however, it can offer insights into the
psychological processes responsible for escalating the tension between,
for example, civilians and police officers.

Even in cases where it isn't possible to create a common identity among
groups in conflict, it may be possible to blur the boundaries between
groups. In one recent experiment, we sorted participants into
groups---red versus blue team---competing for a cash prize. Half of the
participants were randomly assigned to see a picture of a segregated
social network of all the players, in which red dots clustered together,
blue dots clustered together, and the two clusters were separated by
white space. The other half of the participants saw an integrated social
network in which the red and blue dots were mixed together in one large
cluster. Participants who thought the two teams were interconnected with
one another reported greater empathy for the out-group players compared
to those who had seen the segregated network. Thus, reminding people
that individuals could be connected to one another despite being from
different groups may be another way to build trust and understanding
among them.

A mere month before Freddie Gray died in police custody, President Obama
addressed the nation on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma:
"We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and
discrimination are immutable, or that racial division is inherent to
America. To deny...progress \-- our progress \-- would be to rob us of
our own agency; our responsibility to do what we can to make America
better.\"

The president was saying that we, as a society, have a responsibility to
reduce prejudice and discrimination. These recent findings from
psychology and neuroscience indicate that we, as individuals, possess
this capacity. Of course, this capacity is not sufficient to usher in
racial equality or peace. Even when the level of prejudice against
particular out-groups decreases, it does not imply that the level of
institutional discrimination against these or other groups will
necessarily improve. Ultimately, [[only **collective**]{.mark}
**action** and **institutional [evolution]{.mark}** can [address]{.mark}
**systemic [racism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The [science is
**clear**]{.mark}]{.underline} on one thing, though: individual bias and
discrimination are changeable. [**[Race]{.mark}-based
[prejudice]{.mark}** and discrimination]{.underline}, in particular,
[[are]{.mark} created and reinforced by]{.underline} many [social
factors]{.underline}, [but they are [**not inevitable** consequences
of]{.mark} **our [biology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Perhaps understanding
how coalitional thinking impacts intergroup relations will make it
easier for us to affect real social change going forward.

[The **conceptual-geopolitical trappings** of \"1865\" fundamentally
define the discourse of \"Afro-Pessimis]{.underline}m and the Ends of
Redemption,\" like assorted neo-pessimist texts: \"The expanding field
of Afro-pessimism theorises \[sic\] the structural relation between
Blackness and Humanity as an irreconcilable encounter, an antagonism.
One cannot know Blackness as distinct from slavery, for there is no
Black temporality which is antecedent to the temporality of the Black
slave.\"25 Critically, Wole Soyinka details \"pre-colonial\" African
languages of \"black\" self-identification from the Yoruba to the Ga to
the Hausa peoples on continent, for starters, in \"The African World and
the Ethnocultural Debate\" (1989). But these details do not enter modern
Eurocentric discussions in the main, be they Marxist or anti-Marxist,
etc.26 There is in Wilderson only the slaver\'s history of slavery---one
slaver\'s official \"national\" or state history and discourse. The
\"expanding field\" of \"Afro-pessimism\" (2.0) further expands
anti-Black, anti-African conceptions of historical agency. There is
nothing outside of, or before, or countering Wilderson\'s \"slavery\"
for the African enslaved. There is only Wilderson\'s \"Blackness,\"
which is curious. For what he casts as \"Black\" rather than \"black\"
is more accurately cast as \"negro\" (in this specifically English
usage, moreover, with no memory of the Spanish or Portuguese etymology)
and not even \"Negro,\" quiet as it\'s kept---since all of [**[Africa is
flatly foreclosed by]{.mark} this acutely paradoxical
[\"Afro-pessimism.\" Both Africa and diasporas
eclipsed]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} his \"[Blackness]{.mark}\" and \"Human
Life\" [turn out to be the blackness]{.mark} and humanism [of]{.mark}
white Americanism, specifically and restrictively, [an **isolationist or
exceptionalist Americanism**]{.mark} despite the past and present
hegemony of white Western humanism and its \"anti-Black racism\"
worldwide]{.underline}. What is the \"Afro\" in \"Afro-pessimism,\"
therefore, when this Afro-pessimism (2.0) revivifies in disguise the
\"negro\" concept of white settler-slave state history and
historiography? It ironically does so in the name of some \"Blackness\"
itself or, rather, the \"blackness\" of whiteness, of white
postulation---not the Blackness of Blackness or the transvaluations of
manifold Black liberation movements themselves, even as it blithely
misappropriates the ongoing if now naturalized cultural-political labor
of that historic Blackness in the upper case. [[A **dominant
Anglo-American discourse of slavery is all**]{.mark} **that [there
is]{.mark} and ever was** now when it comes to the Black [and]{.mark}
African, [all]{.mark} anti-slavery discourses and
[counter-discourses]{.mark} of slavery as well as Blackness somehow
[vanished]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[A glaring absence of Black radical
and revolutionary intellectual history]{.underline}** [should be
expected from]{.underline}]{.mark} any expression of
\"[[Afro-pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" Indeed, could Afro-pessimism
2.0 take hold as another trend in mainstream academia except in the
political void produced after the 1960s and \'70s by local as well as
global counter-revolution and counter-insurgency? [This absence affects
the shape and agenda of the critical analysis of \"anti-Black racism\"
in essential ways]{.underline}. [[Wilderson\'s critique]{.mark} of the
\"**ruse of analogy**\"]{.underline} in Red, White & Black becomes a
refrain that [[naturalizes]{.mark} academic approaches to politics now
institutionalized with [the]{.mark} **continued [reign of Western
bourgeois liberalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For]{.underline} older and
[enduring Black radical perspectives, the existence of \"anti-Black
racism\" among non-Black peoples]{.underline}, organizations, and
movements [is neither]{.underline} a [new nor shocking]{.underline}
phenomenon. [For many Black revolutionary movement logics]{.underline}
of the \'60s and \'70s, for instance, **[this did not preclude
alliance]{.underline}** (or the exhaustion of alliances made) [or lead
to a doctrinaire rejection of \"solidarity\" work and its
international]{.underline} (or \"intercommunal\")
[possibilities]{.underline}.27 \"[Contradictions]{.underline}\" [were
expected]{.underline}, so to speak, [in theory and
practice]{.underline}, which might be resolved or not, depending on
material interest, circumstance, etc. For them, [this [work was]{.mark}
not [about]{.mark} gauging identity, or the perfection of a projected
analogy, but **[mobilization for the political accomplishments of
revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}---a revolutionism [that
could]{.underline} or may not [work toward the **development of a new
humanism**]{.underline} not white or racist or anti-Black after all.
[The reach for potential solidarities was not construed as a gift or an
act of good-willed benevolence]{.underline}, wise or unwise given the
risks. [Even [solidarity]{.mark} work [with]{.mark} obviously
[problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}, openly enemy [[forces could be a
**strategic or tactical mode**]{.underline} [of advancing
Black]{.underline}]{.mark} [collective [self-interests]{.mark} that
might dispense with any alliance at any given moment in
time]{.underline} without seeing the relationship as a statement of some
total identity or non-identity of condition and interests. **[The notion
of solidarity has nowadays been superficialized]{.underline}**,
[remaining riveted on mere rhetorical proclamation]{.underline} and
aesthetic or representational identification in neo-colonial culture
industries here and there. [An older, praxical approach to
alliance]{.underline}, perhaps \"analogy,\" [and solidarity is not taken
up by current analyses of identity conflicts that prevail with the
resurgence of a more **academic political-intellectualism**]{.underline}
[and a now much less contested liberalism]{.underline}. **[This is
imperial \"multiculturalism\"]{.underline}** and its malcontents. [As
much as [Afro-pessimism]{.mark}]{.underline} (2.0) [may object to
certain instances of liberalism]{.underline}, or \[End Page 292\]
regulation white racist liberalism at least, [it [assumes]{.mark} these
[Western epistemic frameworks of white academic liberalism]{.mark} all
the same]{.underline}, thereby **[[ensconcing]{.mark} the
[colonialism]{.mark} and neo-colonialism]{.underline}** [it
constantly]{.underline} and symptomatically [denegates]{.underline} in
text after text. Black anti-colonialism / anti-colonialist Blackness The
great anti-colonialist poet of Négritude, Aimé Césaire wrote famously in
his letter of resignation from the French Communist Party that he wanted
Marxism and communism to be placed in the service of Black peoples and
not Black peoples in the service of Marxism or communism. He maintained
in 1956: \"it is clear that our struggle---the struggle of colonial
peoples against colonialism, the struggle of peoples of color against
racism---is more complex, or better yet, of a completely different
nature than the fight of the French worker against French capitalism,
and it cannot in any way be considered a part, a fragment, of that
struggle.\"28 As always, he was writing on behalf of Black people who
were, proverbially, the only people on the planet who have been excluded
from the \"human race\" by the \"modern\" history of Western racism and
colonialism which obstructs \"a true humanism---a humanism made to the
measure of the world.\"29 What is this Négritude if not Blackness, Black
anti-colonialism, or anti-colonial Blackness? This tradition is not a
tradition in [Wilderson]{.underline} who [regularly [critique]{.mark}s
the analogical arrogance of Marxism, feminism, and an academic paradigm
of \"post-colonialism\" with less common reference to \"queer\" or \"gay
and lesbian\" categories of analysis as well]{.underline}---**[all in
the name of pessimism]{.underline}**. For him, none of these political
frameworks with their privileged identarian subjects can capture the
condition of \"Blackness\" and \"slavery\" (or \"the Black/Slave\").
[While that perspective can allow for some insights]{.underline}---ones
certainly seen before around the Black world and ones certainly avoided
by so much institutional scholarship---**[it [leaves the general
categorical grid of established Western political epistemologies
intact]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The familiar academic terrain of \"race,
gender, class, and sexuality\" frames the critique for \"Blackness\" of
\"gender, class, and sexuality\" in addition to \"post-coloniality\" or
\"post-colonialism.\" The most conventional [**[US academic categories
of identity]{.mark}** and analysis [are]{.mark}]{.underline} still
[[rendered]{.underline}]{.mark} in full as **[discrete, [monolithic, and
monological]{.mark}]{.underline}** categories and referents (e.g.,
workers, women, etc.), like the respective political ideologies based
upon them in the traditional ideological history of the white West
(e.g., Marxism, feminism, etc.). There are \"workers\" and then there
are \"women,\" generically, and then sometimes there are \"gays\" by
whatever name, not to mention \"natives\" or the colonized in this
culturally specific epistemology of a specific culture of colonialism
itself. **[[The upshot is quite conservative]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
even anachronistically so. [This critique is an internal if damning
critique embodying and encouraging **pessimism** largely **from within
the established order of knowledge** that it analytically engages and
categorically replenishes and preserves]{.underline}. [The grid politics
of Wilderson\'s critique of \"the ruse of analogy\" **leaves all manner
of \"Blackness\" in a wasteland**]{.underline}. The routine categorical
contrast with \"Native Americans\" reduces all that and any colonial
condition to a startlingly oversimplified matter of \"land\" (or \"land
restoration\"); and it occludes \"Afro-Indian\" history as well as
\"Red-Black\" maroonage all across the Americas. The constant generic
contrast with \"feminism\" or \"non-Black women\" eclipses the more
mammoth criticism of \"gender\" writ large in Diop and Amadiume\'s
Black-African studies of Europe or \"Western Civilization\" as a
\"racial patriarchy\" of pessimism and \"anti-Black\" imperialism. [The
contrast with Marxism and its \"workers\" never resurrects any issues of
\"class\" or economics from any other perspective to recognize or to
resist]{.underline}, for example, [the white invention of Black elites
as vital instruments of racism, anti-Blackness, and
white-supremacism]{.underline}. **[There never appears a trace of any
critique of Black \"social class\']{.underline}** (or political class)
**[elitism in \"Afro-pessimism\"]{.underline}** (2.0), [which is a
tell-tale sign of petty-bourgeois]{.underline} or \"lumpen-bourgeois\"
[articulations]{.underline}. Lastly, Wilderson\'s occasional categorical
contrast of \"Blackness\" with Palestinians or al-Nakba (which aligns in
Arabic with the Swahili substitution for the term \"Middle
Passage\"---Maafa, the \"Catastrophe\") comprehends no Blackness in
Palestine or among Palestinians. His Afro-pessimism can envision no
Afro-Palestinianism, unlike a great tradition of Pan-African discourses
that also do not dislocate Palestine from an anti-colonialist mapping of
the African continent or the Afro-Asian landmass of a Pan-Africanist and
\"Bandung\" imagination, one powerfully shared by Malcolm X and Fayez A.
Sayegh. For \"Black Power\" internationally, Kwame Ture would refer to
Palestine as the \"tip of Africa\" and uphold Fatima Bernawi, the iconic
Black woman who\'s been named the \"first Palestinian female political
prisoner,\" as the paragon of \"Black and Palestinian Revolutions.\"30
She is likewise canonized by other Afro-Palestinian icons themselves,
such as Ali Jiddeh and Mahmoud Jiddeh of the African community of the
Old City of Jerusalem, for example---or, say, Ahmad and Jumaa Takrouri
of Occupied Jericho---who are each among the greatest of all icons
across Historic Palestine, a country which has produced multiple Black
Panther formations in Hebrew as well as Arabic in the 1970s and the
1980s. Again, Wilderson tacitly \"nationalizes\" his category of
\"Blackness\" although this is scarcely in the interests of Black people
in or outside of the US colonized mainland of Americanism; and so none
of the above \"Blackness\" survives the critical grid of a very
Anglo-American (and white racist state-bound) critique of \"analogy,\"
regardless of the \"Afro-pessimist\" text at hand. Do not the vulgar
colonial-nativist politics of Incognegro\'s strangely overlooked comment
on \"West Indians\" go full blown then in Red, White & Black and
elsewhere?31 [[There is]{.underline}]{.mark} here [[a]{.underline}
**[general critical erasure]{.underline}** [of the **massive tradition
of Black anti-colonialism**]{.underline}]{.mark}---or anti-colonial
Black resistance to \"anti-Blackness\" and anti-Black colonialism,
[[which]{.mark} transcends nationalization]{.underline}. [Wilderson\'s
\"[Afro-pessimist\" rejects the anti-colonialist paradigms of supposedly
\"other\" peoples, and]{.mark}]{.underline} yet in a manner that
**[[reinstates]{.mark} US or [Western coloniality]{.mark}
nonetheless]{.underline}**---a white colonialism [[that oppresses \"the
Black\" inside and outside the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates\'s
official geopolitical limits]{.underline}. This position can thus make a
virtue out of automatic and absolute anti-alliance postures with no
further, actual political action then required for Black people, \"the
Black critic,\" or any Black liberation struggle on this view. [[Such
chauvinism **without political commitment or engagement beyond
critique**]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} [logically
[consistent]{.mark}]{.underline}, for pessimism, [[where **mere
resentment**]{.mark} or ressentiment [can masquerade as
resistance]{.mark} or \"pro-Black\" \"radicalism.\"]{.underline} After
all, [[Afro-pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark} (2.0) [**[begins with a proud
suspicion]{.underline}** [of Black liberation]{.underline}]{.mark} or
Black liberation movement, [itself, no less than of its potentially
\"anti-racist\" or \"anti-Black\" **political alliances**]{.underline}.
This provincial \"American\" pessimism reveals more affinities with
Créolite in the Caribbean than Césaire\'s anti-colonialist eruption of
Pan-African Négritude, in reality, its narrowly and negatively delimited
rhetoric of the \"Blackness\" of \"the Black\" (as \"Slave,\" of course)
notwithstanding. As if this too is a virtue, [[pessimism]{.mark} is not
just suspicious of power but
**possibility**]{.underline}---[while]{.underline}, upholding dystopia,
[it [is casually **dismissive of all historical actuality**]{.mark} that
does not support a pessimist paradigm, orientation or
sensibility]{.underline}. Analytically, moreover, there is somehow no
white colonialism for Blacks to fight in Africa or Black countries of
Black people anywhere and no terrible landlessness that afflicts the
African diasporas of Blackness captive within white settler and/or
imperial state formations, for Wilderson and Afro-pessimism (2.0).

**Haider, 18**---founding editor of Viewpoint Magazine (Asad, *Mistaken
Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump* pg 36-40, ebook, dml)

[The assumption that **only black-led organizations** could organize
around "**their**" issues, despite]{.underline} the [**deep political
divergences** among these organizations]{.underline}---some of which
represented the elite interests of a black bourgeoisie and explicitly
sought to suppress grassroots militancy---[would]{.underline} come to
[have a **deeply damaging effect**]{.underline}. Among intellectuals,
the most [reactionary separatist tendencies were granted the status of a
**pseudo-philosophy** with the ascendance of]{.underline} Frank
Wilderson's so-called **[[Afro-pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A
fundamental symptom of this trend was the proliferation of the term
antiblackness in the place of racism. The latter, more quotidian term
implies an antiracist struggle that unites oppressed groups. [The
"antiblackness" problematic **radicalizes** and [**ontologizes** a
separatist]{.mark}, black-exceptionalist [perspective]{.mark},
**[rejecting]{.mark} even the [minimal]{.mark} gesture toward
[coalitions]{.mark}** implied by the term people of color. It
claims]{.underline}, on the basis of dubious interpretations of Gramsci
and the historiography of slavery, [that "blackness" is founded on
"**social death**," the **loss of identity** and **total domination**
imposed upon slaves at birth---despite the fact that]{.underline} the
source of this term, sociologist Orlando [Patterson]{.underline}, [used
it to define **all forms of slavery**, including **nonracialized
ones**]{.underline}.7 [It follows]{.underline} from Wilderson's
reasoning [that the **whole of "white" civil society** is founded on
this absolute violence, the **entire history of which** is reduced to an
effect of a **purported white enjoyment of black suffering**---"as
though the **chief business of slavery**,"]{.underline} in the
inimitable words of historian Barbara Fields, ["were the production of
**white supremacy** rather than the production of **cotton**, **sugar**,
**rice** and **tobacco**."]{.underline}8 [With ideologies of racial
unity functioning as a **clear block** to the development of **mass
antagonistic politics**, it is no wonder that the seemingly extremist
languages of blackness and antiblackness **seduced intellectuals into
reconciliation with the status quo**]{.underline}. Of course, [when
[Afro-pessimist]{.mark} discourse]{.underline} course occasionally [did
discuss the black political class, its tone was one of **severe
criticism**. But this [criticism **reproduced the political**]{.mark}
[**dynamics that led to its rise in the first place**: black leaders
were castigated for their coalitionism]{.mark}, thus reinforcing the
ideology of racial unity that obscured their class positions; their
reformist program of bringing black people greater citizenship rights
was **rejected** in language **reminiscent of earlier critiques of
integration**, obscuring the political incorporation of the black elite
that has been taking place since the end of segregation]{.underline}.9
The ideology of blackness in Wilderson's [Afro[-pessimism functions
as]{.mark} a **[disavowal of]{.mark} the real [integration]{.mark}** of
black elites into "[civil society]{.mark}," [now **hardly a "white"
thing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When the lethal effects of white supremacy
are exerted by a racially integrated ruling class, [blackness as [an
**antipolitical void** becomes a **convenient subject position** for the
performance of marginality]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Separatist ideology
**prevents the construction of unity among the marginalized**, the kind
of unity that could **actually overcome their
marginalization**]{.underline}. In a 2014 radio interview, [Wilderson
attacked the view that the experience of black people]{.underline} in
Ferguson [was in **any way comparable to that of
Palestinians**]{.underline}. Attributing this view to "right reactionary
white civil society and so-called progressive colored civil society,"
[he proclaimed]{.underline}: "That's just bullshit. First, there's no
time period in which black policing and slave domination have ever
ended. Second, [the Arabs and the Jews are as much a part of the black
slave trade---the creation of blackness as social death---as anyone
else]{.underline} ... Antiblackness is as important and necessary to the
formation of Arab psychic life as it is to the formation of Jewish
psychic life."10 [Listening to Wilderson's **bewildering [repetitions of
neoconservative]{.mark} Orientalist [tropes]{.mark}**, you [wouldn't
know that **activists in Ferguson**]{.mark} **had [been in close contact
with Palestinians]{.mark}**, who pointed out that [the **same tear-gas
canisters were being fired**]{.mark} **at them** and **shared
street-fighting tactics** learned from bitter experience]{.underline}. A
solidarity statement signed by a range of Palestinian activists and
organizations declared: "With a Black Power fist in the air, we salute
the people of Ferguson and join in your demands for justice." This
solidarity was returned in January when a group of movement activists
visited Palestine. During the peak of the Black Lives Matter movement,
[Afro-pessimist language spread rapidly]{.underline} on Twitter and
Tumblr, [encouraging]{.underline} a wide range of [activists to
describe]{.underline} police [violence in terms of the suffering imposed
upon "**black bodies**" and to try to **monopolize the very category of
death**. It was a]{.underline} somewhat [**stupefying**
choice]{.underline} of words at a time [[when black people in Ferguson
were]{.mark} constituting [part of a global struggle to
**refuse**]{.mark} **to accept [suffering]{.mark}**, to **refuse to
die**]{.underline}. As Robin D. G. Kelley has pointed out, [reading
black experience through trauma can **easily slip into thinking**
of]{.underline} ourselves as [**victims** and **objects rather than
agents**, subjected to]{.underline} centuries of [[gratuitous
violence]{.mark} that have **structured** and
**[overdetermined]{.mark}**]{.underline} our very
**[[being]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the argot of our day,
["[bodies]{.mark}"]{.underline}---vulnerable and threatening
bodies---[**increasingly [stand in for actual people]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark} names, [experiences]{.mark}, dreams, and
desires]{.underline}. But in fact, Kelley points out, "[what sustained
enslaved African people was [a **memory of freedom**, **dreams of
seizing it**]{.mark}, and **conspiracies to enact
it**]{.underline}"---[a heritage of resistance that is [**erased by the
rhetoric** of "**black bodies**."]{.mark}]{.underline} Furthermore,
Kelley argues, [if]{.underline} we argue that [state violence is
**merely a manifestation of antiblackness** because that is **what we
see** and **feel**, [we are left with **no**]{.mark} **theory of the
state** and have **no way of [understanding racialized police
violence]{.mark}** [in places]{.mark}]{.underline} such as Atlanta and
Detroit, [[where most cops are black]{.mark}, unless we turn to some
**metaphysical explanation**]{.underline}.11 Here we get to the crux of
the problem. [The ["metaphysical explanation]{.mark}"]{.underline}---the
classic mode of ideological superstition---[**[obscures]{.mark}** not
only the [**social relations of the state**,]{.mark} but also the
**contradiction between mass insurgency** and the **rising black elite**
that claimed to represent it]{.underline}. Wilderson claims that
[Afro-pessimism seeks to "**destroy the world**" rather than **build a
better one**, since the world is **irredeemably founded** on
"antiblackness." In reality, Afro-pessimism has **served as an
ideological ballast** for the **emergent bureaucracies** in Ferguson and
beyond, since the **supposedly radical rhetoric** of separatism and the
reformism of the elite leadership have **converged** to **foreclose the
possibilities of building a mass movement**]{.underline}. The
"representatives" of the Black Lives Matter movement who got the most
media play included the executive director of Saint Louis Teach for
America, an organization that has played a driving role in the
privatization of education and the assault on teachers' unions. In fact,
a group of these "representatives" enthusiastically met with the
aggressively pro-charter and pro-testing secretary of education Arne
Duncan during his visit to Ferguson---white civil society or not. [If
such tendencies **continue unchecked**, [the **only world that will be
destroyed** is the one in which **poor black students can
attend**]{.mark} **public [school]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} **expect to [get
a job]{.mark} with benefits**.]{.underline}

**[at: empathy bad / various fiat k's]{.underline}**

**It's valuable to use political imagination based upon the principles
of entangled and imperfect empathy to construct more ethical relations,

[The psychological literature is also replete with discussions of
empathy as coupled with a motivational state in order for helping action
or pro-social behavior to occur]{.underline}.1 Generally, these
"psychological" motivational states fall into two mutually exclusive
general categories: self-interested motivation and altruistic
motivation. If the self is understood as deeply relational, the
distinction between these motivational states breaks down. And this is
the third sense of motivation I want to mention. Attuned [[moral
perception moves me to **act on behalf of the wellbeing of

[Directing one\'s empathetic attention toward others is]{.underline}
also [shaped largely by whether one is so motivated]{.underline}, so
while entangled empathizing moves us to action, we can alter our
empathetic focus by acts of will. [The process of [being moved by
entangled empathetic attention and]{.mark} being moved [to refine our
empathy are part of the]{.mark} **dynamic [process of developing]{.mark}
our [moral perception]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

When one is made aware of a shortcoming in her responsiveness or a
failure of her empathetic attention, when she is able, in other words,
to see that she is in a "bad" relationship, as I put it---by which I
mean one of instrumentalization, exploitation, or violence, for
example---she cannot maintain that relationship and hold onto the belief
that she is engaged in loving or caring attention. That sort of
attention is part of what it means to be a moral agent, I suggest, so
one is at least going to be moved to change one\'s conception, and I
would hope, that will also lead to behavioral changes.

But [[there is a **deeper resonance to the question "why
care?"**]{.mark} that addresses a danger that has been mentioned to me
on a number of occasions and that all of my critics
discuss]{.underline}. That is a worry about the possibility of ever
really, truly understanding and empathizing with another. In the book, I
discuss a case worth repeating briefly here. Two wealthy black parents
who raised their children to be cautious in white society were
devastated in the aftermath of an incident in which their son, who was
walking near the boarding school he attended in Connecticut, was called
the "N" word. The son became scared and angry, and felt vulnerable. This
incident had a negative impact on his schoolwork and his confidence.
When the father, Mr. Graham, tried to get the attention of the
administration at his son\'s school, he received little response. This
led him to realize that he was no better able to understand the
perspective of the white people to whom he reported the incident than of
those who called his son the "N" word (Graham 2014).

In many ways Mr. Graham is right. [[White people in a culture of
anti-black racism cannot understand]{.mark} the burden of
[racism]{.mark}]{.underline}. And if white people can\'t understand
Black people, what hope is there to understand a chimpanzee in
entertainment, a dairy cow, or a lab rat? **[Perhaps entangled empathy
is simply too optimistic]{.underline}** to think any sort of meaningful
moral perception is possible.

[Recently, I was asked by]{.underline} Frank
**[Wilderson]{.underline}**, whose work I much admire,
**[why]{.underline}** do I **[care?]{.underline}** I got a better sense
of the force of his question after reading his paper "'Raw Life' and the
Ruse of Empathy."2 In it Wilderson interrogates "an optimism that
assumes relationality within and between all sentient beings." [His
analysis is that there are some beings who are beyond
relationality]{.underline}. "The explanatory powers of empathy and
analysis are scandalized when confronted with the Black position, a
paradigmatic location synonymous with slavery" (Wilderson 2013, 184).
Following on the definition of slavery provided by Orlando Patterson as
a permanent, violent domination of natally alienated and generally
dishonored persons (Patterson 1988), **[Wilderson sees Blackness as a
form of social death]{.underline}**, a state of being deprived of
relationality. [So "even perceived moments of empathic identification
with the Slave are ruses"]{.underline} (Wilderson 2013, 189), as one
cannot empathize with objects or beings that are not in the relation.
Further, [he argues that]{.underline} if empathy is meant to facilitate
and produce "civic relation and if anti-Blackness is the generative
mechanism of this mode of production, then it becomes understandable how
and why" (201) [empathy is problematic]{.underline}.

There are two concerns here; the latter is not unlike the worry that
Debes raises about epistemic injustice, although in a different
register. Debes says "dominant social groups trade on existing,
'collectively' shared---perhaps we should say, mainstream---forms of
social understanding to reach self- and interpersonal understanding. And
disempowered groups are pressed to conform to these normalized,
mainstream social understandings" (\$\$). [[If these]{.mark} normalized
[understandings require]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Wilderson says, [the
[social death]{.mark} of Black people]{.underline}, and these
understandings are what entangled empathy is relying on, [[then it looks
like entangled empathy is in the service of anti-Blackness]{.mark} and
should thus be rejected]{.underline}. Debes is right insofar as this
form of understanding is meant to be full understanding, and he is also
onto something if the understanding required for entangled empathy
inescapably emerges from mainstream "narrative tropes." **[[But I\'m not
sure why either needs to be the case]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Trying to
fully understand is not the same as actually achieving]{.mark} full
[understanding]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} among those [[on the margins
happens all the time]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, following the
insights of Black feminists, often those on the margins understand more
than those at the center, as they have opportunities for understanding
both.

What I take us to be doing when [[we are]{.mark} engaged in]{.underline}
entangled empathetic moral attention is [[working through **complicated
processes of understanding one another**]{.underline}]{.mark} and other
animals [[in situations of differential]{.mark} social, political, and
species-based [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Usually what we "get" is just
a glimpse. [We never really "know," but [too many people use the idea
that we can\'t really know as an **excuse to opt out of working at
it**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[I take this to be a failure of]{.mark}
both [imagination and moral agency]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The second worry will be something I continue to work out, and that is a
more robust description of relationality. On the relational ontology I
envisage, [[there is no place beyond relations]{.underline}]{.mark};
[[anti-Blackness]{.underline}]{.mark} or speciesism, for example, [[are
political and ethical relations]{.mark} that view whites and humans as
justified in regarding Blacks]{.underline} and animals [as fungible,
disposable, and]{.underline} perhaps paradoxically, [outside of
relationality]{.underline}. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} as I\'ve
suggested, **[the [relations we are in are not]{.mark}]{.underline}**
always, perhaps not even often, **[[the]{.mark} sorts of [things we
choose]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Some relations I am forced into, some I
seek to develop, some are unjust, some are harmful, some may even seek
to forever deprive me of my subjectivity. And since we are constituted
in various ways by these relations, when some relations make it hard to
see ourselves and others, entangled empathy will seem almost impossible.
But [that these relationships are part of us means that [we]{.mark}
can]{.underline}, **[indeed [must]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[work with
them and try to change them for the better]{.underline}]{.mark}.

I think **[that is something to care about]{.underline}**.

Discussion [The]{.underline} current [study investigated the
relationships between hope, suicidal ideation, and the interpersonal
risk factors of suicidal desire]{.underline} (Joiner, 2005) [in a sample
of African American college students]{.underline}. [[**Consistent with
previous literature**, hope]{.mark} was [**negatively correlated**
to]{.mark} symptoms of [depression]{.mark}, thwarted belongingness, and
perceived burdensomeness]{.underline}. [Hope was not significantly
correlated to suicidal ideation]{.underline} in this sample. However,
[the **[agency]{.mark}** subscale of hope was [**negatively correlated**
to suicidal ideation]{.mark}]{.underline}. To expand on the simple
associations between hope and suicidal ideation previously established
in the literature, [the]{.underline} current [study took a contextualist
approach]{.underline}. More specifically, [through the use of moderation
analyses this study sought to better understand the circumstances of the
established relationship between hope and suicidal ideation in an
African American sample]{.underline}. It was hypothesized that [levels
of hope would moderate the relationship between feelings of perceived
burdensomeness and thoughts of suicide]{.underline}. As hypothesized,
[the relationship between perceived burdensomeness and suicidal ideation
was moderated by hope]{.underline}. [High levels of hope weakened the
relationship between perceived burdensomeness when **statistically
controlling** for symptoms of depression]{.underline}. In other words,
[at **high levels of hope**, the relationship between perceived
burdensomeness and suicidal ideation was no longer strong and positive
as seen with low levels of hope]{.underline}. [These results suggest
that [those who are]{.mark} naturally [more hopeful are **buffered
against deleterious effects**]{.mark} (i.e., suicidal ideation) when
experiencing feelings of perceived burdensomeness]{.underline}.
[Individuals who feel comfortable setting goals [and]{.mark} are
motivated to achieve them may be **[better equipped to cope]{.mark}**
with feelings of perceived burdensomeness]{.underline}. Those who are
more hopeful but feel as though they are a burden on others may be
better equipped to cope with these feelings, as they may be able to
naturally identify ways they can contribute to the well-being of others
and are motivated to achieve these goals. [This, in turn, may **protect
against thoughts of suicide** when experiencing feelings of perceived
burdensomeness]{.underline}. Also consistent with hypotheses, [high
levels of hope weakened the relationship between thwarted belongingness
and suicidal ideation after controlling for symptoms of
depression]{.underline}. [Simple slope analyses indicated that the
relationship between thwarted belongingness and suicidal ideation was
strong and positive at low levels of hope but unrelated at high levels
of hope]{.underline}. This result suggests that [even though extreme
feelings of social disconnection and unreciprocated caring are strongly
associated with suicidal thinking, this relationship may only exist in
those who are low in hope]{.underline}. [Individuals who naturally
engage in goal-directed thinking and are motivated to identify and use
pathways to obtain their goals may feel as though they are more equipped
to find solutions to feeling disconnected from others]{.underline}.
Thus, [when a hopeful individual feels thwarted in their belonging, they
may be less likely to experience the negative effects of this feeling
because they are better able to work toward connecting with
others]{.underline}. Generally, [the results of the current study
indicate that [African Americans who exhibit higher]{.mark} levels of
[hope]{.mark} (i.e., engage in goal-directed thinking, can identify
pathways to achieve goals, and are naturally motivated to achieve their
goals) [may be **buffered against suicidal ideation**]{.mark} even in
the presence of prominent interpersonal predictors of suicidal desire
(i.e., thwarted belongingness and perceived
burdensomeness)]{.underline}. This investigation is timely, as the ITS
has received empirical support as a strong model of understanding
suicide in the general population (i.e., Joiner et al., 2009), African
Americans (Davidson et al., 2010), American Indian/Alaska Natives
(O'Keefe et al., 2013), elderly populations (Jahn & Cukrowicz, 2011),
and veterans (Anestis, Bryan, Cornette, & Joiner, 2009). [Although
feelings of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness have
been linked to thoughts of suicide in African Americans in both the
current investigation and previous work]{.underline} (Davidson et al.,
2010; Hollar, 2010; Lamis & Lester, 2012), [the current study indicates
that this relationship may only detrimentally affect those African
Americans who are less hopeful]{.underline}. [Specifically, for less
hopeful participants, as their perceptions of being a burden and not
belonging increased, so did their thoughts of suicide]{.underline}.

**Activism combats race-related stress**

Racism is deeply ingrained in American society, and white supremacy and
the oppression of people of color has greatly contributed to the
establishment of the very institutions that continue to perpetuate its
existence today. Racism manifests itself in a variety of ways, and its
most constant and daily appearance is in instances of microaggressions.
These experiences contribute to feelings of invisibility, frustration,
and anger, an experience known as racism- related stress, which research
has shown to severely and negatively impact mental health. In order to
combat the insidious effects of racism, Black Americans have utilized
coping mechanisms for generations. [This [resiliency is]{.mark}
astoundingly [powerful]{.mark}, however, dealing with the omnipresence
of racism is a constant and significant internal labor. [For]{.mark}
Black college [students]{.mark} at predominately white institutions,
[microaggresions]{.mark} and systemic racism [create a difficult
environment to navigate]{.mark}. **Unique [opportunities in activism
manifest]{.mark}** themselves **[as tools to combat]{.mark}**
discrimination and **[racism-related stress]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
However, some argue that caution is needed in viewing activism as
panacea for improving the lives of people of color, particularly Black
people. Indeed, some research has suggested that activism is harmful to
mental health, as it increases the intensity and frequency of
experiences of perceived racism among some populations. [This thesis
includes a **[meta-analysis]{.mark}** that [examines]{.mark} the
findings on the [effects of activism on mental health]{.mark}. As a
result of this analysis, a counter argument [argues the potential
of]{.mark} the [**utilization of activism** as a source of
strength]{.mark} that may [combat the harms of racism]{.mark},
supporting the earlier claim that certain factors involved in activism
may be protective in nature]{.underline}.

Results As Table 1 shows, the Moderate Hope group had a slightly higher
proportion of younger people whereas the High Hope group had slightly
higher proportion of older people. Across all three levels of hope, at
least a third of the participants had a high school diploma. Among High,
Moderate, and Low Hope individuals, about 50%, 43%, 33% had at least
some college experience or was a college graduate, respectively. [While
categories of annual household income were distributed rather evenly
among the High and Moderate Hope groups, **approximately [half of the
people in Low Hope group had an annual household income of less
\$30,000]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Over 40% in the High Hope group were
married. Approximately 34% and 32% of Moderate and Low Hope individuals,
respectively, were married. Table 4 presents the relationship among age,
income, education, racial microaggressions, and societal problems. We
found that age and educational level significantly affected MEES. After
controlling for age, **[[annual household income]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
educational level, and racial microaggressions (b = 0.327, β = 0.258, p
\< 0.01) and societal problems (b = 1.199, β = 0.346, p \< 0.01) still
[**[significantly affected]{.underline}** [MEES]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the High Hope group. [[Racial microaggressions accounted for
**6.4%**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the variation in MEES]{.underline},
[[while **societal problems**]{.mark} accounted for
**[11.9]{.mark}%.**]{.underline} However, when we looked at the group of
African American males with Moderate Hope, we found that societal
problems was not significant. Only racial microaggressions (b = 0.382, β
= 0.317, p \< 0.01) significantly predicted MEES in this group after
controlling for demographic characteristics. The variations in MEES
accounted for by racial microaggressions were 9.8%, a nd the variations
accounted for by societal problems were 3.4%. Among African American
males in the Low Hope group, the results indicated that none of the
factors (i.e., ag e, annual household income, educational level, racial
microaggressions, and societal problems) have any significant influence
in MEES. Racial microaggressions and societal proble ms were no longer
significant, and they only explained 3.4% and 0.5% of the variance in
MEES, respectively. Altogether, age, annual household income,
educational level, racial microaggressions, and societ al problems
accounted for 24.3% of the total variation in MEES in the High Hope
group, 27.7% in the Moderate Hope group, and 6.8% in the Low Hope group.

Hope appears to play a different role for the African American men in
this study when compared to previous research. [Race-related
socialization appears to influence how much **[hope is healthy]{.mark}**
or realistic]{.underline} (Bowman & Howard, 1985; Brown, 2008; Fischer &
Shaw, 1999; Neblett, Philip, Cogburn, & Sellers, 2006). African American
men with high to moderate levels of hope had more stress associated with
racial microaggressions and societal problems than did men who had low
hope. Like similar findings in the study by Danoff-Burg, Prelow, and
Swenson (2004), we are encouraged from our findings that hope works
differently for African American men. **[Hope appears to be [correlated
with]{.mark} a more [realistic assessment of]{.mark} the possibilities
of [experiences]{.mark} that African American men might
face.]{.underline}** [Possessing a more [realistic]{.mark} understanding
of the potential for racist discrimination [offers]{.mark} these men
additional [avenues for coping]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Hope does not
always have to be based in reality.]{.underline} Therefore, [by having a
more accurate understanding of racial microaggressions and societal
problems, these men learn to avoid extremely harmful external control
behaviors]{.underline} that can destroy typical or mainstream avenues
for reaching their goals. It should be clear that [[we are not
suggesting]{.mark} that African American men with low or moderate levels
of hope are playing into [a negative self-fulfilling
prophecy]{.mark}]{.underline} or that they are not reaching their
expected goals. However, we are suggesting that **[low and moderate hope
men are taking into account additional realities that their high hope
peers appear to overlook and]{.underline}** therefore they **[are
struggling with more self-reported stressors.]{.underline}** Under these
circumstances, the opening quote from Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
is still appropriate in the present lives of African American men.
Moreover, in our study, [to be an African American man is to hope
against hope that racial microaggressions, societal problems, and racial
battle fatigue will diminish in the near future.]{.underline} Thus, [we
agree]{.underline} with Stevenson (1997), [African American men must
possess]{.underline} three [important forms of racial socialization as
forms of coping]{.underline}: proactive, protective, and adaptive. [In
our study, it appears that **[adaptive racial socialization]{.mark}**
might be [play]{.mark}ing [a significant role]{.mark} in [reducing
stress among low hope African American men]{.mark}. Adaptive racial
socialization is [an **orientation** that **recognizes**
]{.mark}]{.underline}the [racial microaggressions and [**racist
discrimination**]{.mark} that pervades, [**identifies it**,]{.mark} and
then **keeps it at bay** long enough [to develop]{.mark} room for
creative [counterstrategies]{.mark} (Stevenson, 1997). Consequently,
high hope African American men, who tend to be slightly more formally
educated, older, hold full-time jobs, higher incomes, and who married in
greater numbers, are more at-risk from the relative safety that adaptive
racial socialization provides. Maintaining or developing adaptive racial
socialization strategies can enhance African American men's belief in a
world that is obfuscated with racists relations while promoting healthy
self-development despite the obstacles they face (Stevenson,
1997).]{.underline}

[Then there are definitions of epistemic difference based on '**lived
experience'**]{.underline}. Although an improvement on territorial or
raciological accounts, [the [ascription of **cultural
difference**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to a]{.mark} generic lived
experience or social [subjectivity]{.mark} [can also **reduce
groups**]{.mark} **of people**]{.underline} [[to **stereotypes** and
**monolithic value sets**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This is [evident
in]{.mark} the work of some [scholars who take Fanon]{.mark} primarily
**[as a source of 'epistemic blackness']{.mark}**]{.underline}, [without
fully addressing his concerns about **racialisation**]{.underline} [and
the **geopolitical dimensions** of **decolonisation**]{.underline}. For
example, the philosopher Lewis R. Gordon writes that 'Fanon's body. . .
is a subtext of all his writings. \... Anxiety over embodiment is a
dimension of Western civilization against which Fanon was in constant
battle. The body, he laments, is a denied presence, and black people are
a denied people' (Gordon, 2015: 8). Even in as sophisticated an analysis
of Fanon as Gordon's, [there is a [danger of **essentialism**
through]{.mark} the [**association** of **black identity** with a
**particular way of thinking**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[For Fanon, black
people were not]{.mark} so much **[universally 'denied']{.mark}** as
**relegated to certain roles**]{.underline} [within a **social
hierarchy** -- the **French empire** most specifically. Blacks could be
of **higher** or **lower** status, but **[race]{.mark}** was the **basis
for social relegation**]{.underline}, [which [**alienated** the subject
from a **full**]{.mark}, **dynamic** **[humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[For Fanon, every **particular experience** is an **instantiation of the
universal**, and his analysis of his own experience is a demand to be
recognised as a fellow human]{.underline} with an equal stake in
humanity. [Blackness is not a **generalisable perspective**]{.underline}
[from which we can **derive a non-Western knowledge**]{.underline}, [but
a reminder to pay attention to the **social** and **historical
specificity** of relation]{.underline}.9

[[Embodiment arguments are]{.mark} usually [the **vehicle** for
**Fanon's presence in IR,**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and are often
[accompanied with the]{.mark} [claim]{.mark} [that **non-Westerners**
have]{.mark} profoundly [**different ways** of]{.mark} **practising

**alternatives**]{.mark} or 'different' ways of doing
politics]{.underline} (Agathangelou, 2016: 111; cf. Sekyi-Otu, 2009). In
a similar argument, John M. Hobson contrasts the 'different critique' of
'African-American Marxists', including Du Bois, with 'white Eurocentric
institutional thinkers' like Leonard Woolf (Hobson, 2012: 17, n. 20).
However, the difference is not as stark as Hobson might hope. It is true
that Woolf's anti-racism was qualified by a belief in elite
institutional development, but so was Du Bois's anti-imperialism.10

**Liberal root cause of war is an ahistoric myth -- their "Empire"
impact can't explain why Western intervention happened in Libya and Iraq
but not in Yemen**

"Fatal attraction: a critique of Carl Schmitt\'s international political
and legal theory", International Theory (2011), 3 : pp 179-227

For at the centre of the heterodox -- partly post-structuralist, partly
realist -- neo-Schmittian analysis stands the conclusion of The Nomos:
the thesis of a structural and continuous relation between liberalism
and violence (Mouffe 2005, 2007; Odysseos 2007). It suggests that, in
sharp contrast to the liberal-cosmopolitan programme of 'perpetual
peace', the geographical expansion of liberal modernity was accompanied
by the intensification and de-formalization of war in the international
construction of liberal-constitutional states of law and the production
of liberal subjectivities as rights-bearing individuals. [Liberal
world-ordering proceeds via the conduit of wars for
humanity]{.underline}, leading to Schmitt\'s 'spaceless universalism'.
In this perspective, [**[a straight line is drawn from WWI to the War on
Terror]{.mark} to verify Schmitt\'s long-term prognostic** of the 20th
century as the age of 'neutralizations and
de-politicizations']{.underline} (Schmitt 1993). **[But [this attempt to
read]{.mark} the [history]{.mark} of 20th century international
relations in terms of a succession of confrontations between the
carrier-nations of liberal modernity and the criminalized foes at its
outer margins [seems unable to comprehend]{.mark} the
[complexities]{.mark} and specificities [of 'liberal'
world-ordering]{.mark}, then and now]{.underline}**. [For in the cases
of Wilhelmine, Weimar and fascist Germany]{.underline}, the assumption
that their conflicts with the Anglo-American liberal-capitalist
heartland were grounded in an [antagonism]{.underline} [between liberal
modernity]{.underline} [and a recalcitrant Germany outside its
geographical and conceptual lines]{.underline} [runs counter to the
historical evidence]{.underline}. For this reading presupposes that
late-Wilhelmine Germany was not already substantially penetrated by
capitalism and fully incorporated into the capitalist world economy,
posing the question of whether the causes of WWI lay in the capitalist
dynamics of inter-imperial rivalry (Blackbourn and Eley 1984), or in
processes of belated and incomplete liberal-capitalist development, due
to the survival of 're-feudalized' elites in the German state classes
and the marriage between 'rye and iron' (Wehler 1997). It also assumes
that the late-Weimar and early Nazi turn towards the construction of an
autarchic German regionalism -- Mitteleuropa or Großraum -- was not
deeply influenced by the international ramifications of the 1929 Great
Depression, but premised on a purely political--existentialist assertion
of German national identity. Against a reading of the early 20th century
conflicts between 'the liberal West' and Germany as 'wars for humanity'
between an expanding liberal modernity and its political exterior, there
is more evidence to suggest that these [confrontations were interstate
conflicts within the crisis-ridden and nationally uneven capitalist
project of modernity]{.underline}. Similar objections and caveats to the
binary opposition between the Western discourse of liberal humanity
against non-liberal foes apply to the more recent period. [For how can
this optic explain that **[the 'liberal West'
coexisted]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and keeps coexisting) [**[with]{.mark}
a large number of** pliant **[authoritarian
client-regimes]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Mubarak\'s [Egypt]{.underline},
Suharto\'s Indonesia, Pahlavi\'s Iran, Fahd\'s [Saudi-Arabia,
even]{.underline} Gaddafi\'s pre-intervention [Libya]{.underline}, to
name but a few), [**[which]{.mark}** were and **[are]{.mark} actively
[managed]{.mark}** and supported by the West **[as
anti-liberal]{.mark}** Schmittian **[states of emergency]{.mark}**, with
concerns for liberal subjectivities and Human Rights secondary to the
strategic interests of political and geopolitical stability and economic
access]{.underline}? Even in the more obvious cases of Afghanistan,
Iraq, and, now, Libya, [the idea that Western intervention has to be
conceived as an encounter between the liberal project and a series of
foes outside its sphere seems to rely on a denial of their antecedent
histories as geopolitically and socially contested state-building
projects]{.underline} in pro-Western fashion, deeply co-determined by
long histories of Western anti-liberal colonial and post-colonial
legacies. If these states (or social forces within them) turn against
their imperial masters, the conventional policy expression is
'blowback'. [And as]{.underline} [**[the]{.mark} Schmittian analytical
[vocabulary]{.mark}** does not include a conception of human agency and
social forces -- only friend/enemy groupings and collective political
entities governed by executive decision -- **it**]{.underline} [also
**[lacks]{.mark} the [categories of analysis to comprehend]{.mark}** the
social dynamics that drive the **[struggles around sovereign power
and]{.mark} the eventual [overcoming]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for
example, **[[of Tunisian and Egyptian states of emergency without US-led
wars for humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Similarly, [[it seems unlikely
that]{.mark} the generic idea of liberal world-ordering and the
production of [liberal subjectivities can]{.mark} actually [explain why
Western intervention seems improbable in some cases]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g. Bahrain, Qatar, [[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark} or Syria) [and [more
likely in others]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. Serbia, **[Afghanistan,
[Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and Libya]{.underline}]{.mark}). Liberal
world-ordering consists of differential strategies of building,
coordinating, and drawing liberal and anti-liberal states into the
Western orbit, and overtly or covertly intervening and refashioning them
once they step out of line. [These are conflicts within a world, which
seem to push the term liberalism beyond its original meaning. The
generic Schmittian idea of a liberal 'spaceless universalism' sits
uncomfortably with the realities of maintaining an America-supervised
'informal empire', **which has to manage a persisting interstate system
in diverse and case-specific ways**]{.underline}. But it is this
persistence of a worldwide system of states, which encase national
particularities, which renders challenges to American supremacy possible
in the first place.

In turn, radical democrats may refuse his reduction of politics to
sovereignty, but [if we]{.underline} then [identify the **properly
political** as **[nonsovereign]{.mark}**]{.underline} action, as nonrule
or (fugitive) **[[refusal]{.underline}]{.mark}** to be governed, [we
[remain **captive** to]{.mark} this [**demonic picture** of
power]{.mark} and its **idealized other**. By affirming **only** the
"**power to**" of solidarity and action in concert, we [risk
**disavowing**]{.mark} power "**over**," as **[participation]{.mark} in
rule**, as **explicit rule-making**, [and]{.mark} as "[**ruling out**"
antidemocratic interests]{.mark} and practices. [Do we imagine that
generativity thrives **only by refusing**]{.mark} **rule**, [and not
also through]{.mark} forms of [**structure** and even
**imposition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as parents and teachers know? As
Prospero, a personification of both sovereignty and theory, finally
acknowledged Caliban as the "dark thing" he must "own as mine," the
trope of fugitivity entails a disavowed remainder, [the **problem of
power** and **rule**]{.underline}, which **[needs to be
acknowledged]{.underline}**. For [[freedom requires **not only flight
from rule**, but]{.mark} **flight [into it]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} as a
problem that **no one can escape**, but that a democratic politics
**explicitly acknowledges** and undertakes to **rework by participatory
practices** of contest]{.underline}.40

Using Moten's own idiom, I would ask: ["What if" we **do not
dichotomize** the informal assembly and praxis of fugitive sociality,
and politics-as-rule predicated on exclusion and regulation of
difference? "What if" a democratic theory must **blur** the social and
political but also [acknowledge]{.mark} **inescapable**, **fraught**,
yet **potentially [fruitful tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}---between
tacit grammar and explicit acts of translation, [[between **informal**
form and **organized**]{.mark} forms of [power]{.mark}]{.underline},
between fugitive aliveness as resistance to rule, and organizing
democratic power to make claims on how the world is ruled? ["What if" we
**refuse** (**not reverse**) the **abstract polarity** between
subjection to sovereign rule as such, or statelessness as **refusal to
be governed** as such, and "come down to earth"]{.underline} as Marx put
it? [We then [find politicality]{.mark} **not in rule** or
**nonrule**]{.underline}, as such, [but [in the **judgments**]{.mark}
and **actions** by [which]{.mark} subalterns [address **who makes
decisions** (and **how**) about **which practices**]{.mark}, **values**,
and **inequalities** [are]{.mark} being [**ruled out**,
or]{.mark}]{.underline} which **[[encouraged]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in
the communities they are building by socio-poetic insurgency? [In
difficult historical contexts [they **rework**]{.mark} and **mediate
tacit grammars**, **customary practices**, and **explicit forms of
[organized power]{.mark}** [as]{.mark}]{.underline} they reconstitute
**[[democratic forms]{.underline}]{.mark}** of rule-making.41

These what-ifs suggest a conversation between Moten and Sheldon Wolin.
The parallels are striking. Wolin depicts a "system" so "immovable and
interconnected as to be unreformable as a totality"; he calls
"pessimism" a "reasoned insight" and "suppressed revolutionary impulse";
and he endorses a "rejectionism" whereby citizens "withdraw and direct
their energies and civic commitment to finding new life forms."
Moreover, "instead of imitating most political theories," which adopt
"the state as the primary structure, and adapt the activity of citizens"
to it, Wolin refuses "the state paradigm" and the "liberal-legal
corruption of the citizen." He affirms how "common life resides in
cooperation and reciprocity that human beings develop to survive, meet
their needs, and explore their capacities and the remarkable world into
which they have been cast." He thus rejects Arendt's splitting of
political and social, and her valorization of the "who," and in Moten's
terms he instead values how "entanglement and virtuosity" are negotiated
in the "common life" of the ordinary. Both theorists thus defend
"preservation" of customary ways of "taking care of beings and things,"
as Wolin says, against neoliberal correction, progressive promises of
incorporation, and radical romances of emancipation.42

Moten's two antagonisms---between the few who run things and things that
run, and between informal form and formalization---echo Wolin's critique
of bureaucracy, of "institutionalized systems of power," and of
"constitutional democracy"; and Moten's refusals resonate with Wolin's
late claim that democracy names not a form of government but "fugitive"
moments of insurgency. And though Wolin seems to mean "fugitive" only in
its temporal sense of transient or fleeting, he also depicts democracy
as interdicted by idioms of governance, contained by constitutions and
organized power, and pathologized by norms stipulating the legal and
proper. Like blackness--- though Wolin never makes this
association---his democracy is (called) criminal, transgressive, and
chaotic; it is feared, hunted, and enclosed, though also "wanted,"
desired, and used for legitimation. Both theorists embrace such epithets
while showing how insurgency bespeaks "jurisgenerative" energies,
engendered by commonality and memory, that precede and surround formal
(state-centric) politics. Their fugitive protagonists---an undercommons
or popular insurgency---claim a spatial and symbolic distance from a
deranged modern regime, and in Wolin's words "replace the old
citizenship" by "a fuller and wider notion of being, whose politicalness
will be expressed not in one or two activities---voting or
protesting---but in many." Of course, this very "politicalness" is one
mark of deep differences.43

Though Wolin's awareness of racial inequality appears in repeated
associations of democratic moments and social movements with black
insurgency, he does not grasp how "commonality" names not (only) a
resource against enclosure but the historical production of whiteness
and settler colonialism. He laments the gap between formal citizenship
and genuine participation, which effectively disempowers legally
enfranchised citizens, but never construes citizenship as a racial
status, "standing" as white, constituted by a racial state of exception.
His hard-pressed "citizens" draw on tacit (local, rooted) customs, but
he does not credit how their "commonality" reproduces popular power by
racial terror. Moten thus brings to this idiom of commonality and
democracy, as to Arendt's "common sense" and "world," a justified
presumption that such predicates of the political mean antiblackness.
But acknowledging this truth is also the premise of thinking abolition
and radical democracy together.44

For if Wolin's commonality risks racial innocence, his idea of [[the
political]{.mark} remains **essential** because it [highlights]{.mark}
the [**foreclosures** in]{.mark}]{.underline} Moten's sociality. First,
Wolin depicts both tacit commonality and explicit insurgency as
contingent and, in that sense, as political. Whereas Moten depicts
[[sociality **underwritten by ontology**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
**reproduced**]{.underline} as antiblackness generates "common
habitation and flight," Wolin sees every (under)common undone by
political economy and individualism, not only [by **incorporation** into
formal politics]{.underline}. Whereas Moten imagines the "absolute
sufficiency" of sociality informally reproduced, Wolin argues that
[commonality]{.underline} itself [is (re)generated and remade **only**
by practices that, though "emerging out of" sociality,
**politicize**---**acknowledge**, **(re)articulate**, or
**(re)organize**---**tacit customs** and **vernacular memories**. Tacit
[commonality is]{.mark} at once discovered, remade and [regenerated
**only** \[when\] people make]{.mark} **explicit claims** in "[**public
declarations**," or]{.mark} **visibly [exercise]{.mark}** ["**collective
power**" to "promote]{.mark} or protect the well-being" of [a
"**collectivity**]{.mark}]{.underline}," including an undercommon.45

Second, Wolin also links and distinguishes sociality and politicality by
depicting the experience and practice of sharing and exercising power.
For Wolin, local or customary "institutions and practices are sustained"
only by our "capacity to share in power, to cooperate in it." ["Power
to," generated and shared by the **ongoing practices of assembly** and
**cooperation** that Moten calls **[planning]{.mark}**, is thus the
**basis** of all other goods. But]{.underline}, as "distilled" from the
"relations and circles we move within"---call this Moten's
sociality---[this power, at once "**symbolic**, **material**, and
**psychological**," "**enables political beings to act
together**."]{.underline} As the political dimension of sociality,
["power" can be **extracted by states** or **undermined by
individualism**, and thus alienated, a loss that **devitalizes the
solidarity**---and thereby the **generative capacity**---of
sociality]{.underline}. The recurring "loss of the political," as
capacities to articulate the tacit and organize power, reveals the
nature of the political as a distinctive "mode of experience," for "we
are always losing it and having to recover it." [But "**renewal**" is
**always possible**]{.underline}, partly "as human beings rediscover the
common being of human beings," [partly by "creating **new patterns of
commonality**" across differences, and partly by (re)making "**modes of
action**" by which to "**concert their powers**."]{.underline} Though
grounded in sociality, Wolin's political thus opens an interval between
the tacit and the explicit, in which experience is metabolized and
(re)articulated. [In this interval people **question the organization of
power** and **rules of justice**, and they **answer** as they
"[**reinvent forms**]{.mark} and **practices**" [that express]{.mark} "a
**[democratic]{.mark} conception** of [collective
life]{.mark}."]{.underline}46

For Moten, of course, "democratic" and collective" signal the alienated
rule that abstracts from lived sociality to "designate" a political to
represent us, whereas black fugitives refuse to be governed or
represented by others but also to translate themselves into legible
political terms. In contrast, Wolin offers a potentially fruitful, not
only correctional or appropriative---we might say agonistic---relation
between the tacit and the explicit. In fact, [practices of "**[fugitive
democracy]{.mark}**" recurrently emerge in and from black sociality, as
the practices of **Black Lives Matter** activism most recently
[demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline}. For sure, [[practices of
**concealment**]{.mark} and **evasion**]{.underline}, which defend black
fugitivity from surveillance, regulatory correction, and violence,
[**[and]{.mark}** practices of **[public action]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that [**[engage]{.mark} whites** and [the **state**]{.mark}, are
**contradictory in crucial ways**]{.underline}, as Juliet Hooker has
argued. [But]{.underline} as Rom Coles and Lia Haro argue, [frontline
communities on the underground railroad also **engaged repeatedly** in
"**flagrantly public**" action [in **concert**]{.mark}, both in
**literal self-defense** of black autonomy in its fugitive illegality,
and to **contest the rule(s)** of police, the law, and the
state]{.underline}; as recent protests suggest, [[they viewed]{.mark}
**formal political [institutions]{.mark}** [both as "**integral to white
supremacy so far**," but also "as]{.mark} **potential [instruments
toward emancipatory ends]{.mark}**."]{.underline}47

If Hooker sees temporal shifts between moments of "black fugitivity" and
moments of "fugitive democracy" in the thought and practice of Frederick
Douglass, Coles/Haro depict an ongoing "oscillation" between
inward-facing and outward-turning practices. Likewise, Neil Roberts
defends grand marronage for seeking a "sustainable rather than fleeting
form of flight" by forging autonomous spaces, and yet, because
"[[freedom]{.underline}]{.mark} in our world [[lies **not in permanent
evasion of Leviathan**]{.underline}" [but in "**taming**"
it]{.underline}]{.mark}, he proposes an idea of "sociogenic marronage"
to reconstruct "an order in need of systemic repair." Not
coincidentally, Wolin's [fugitive democracy, though "**rejectionist**"
and **antistatist** in its major chords, includes a **social democratic
minor key**, which notes the **limits of [localism]{.mark}** and the
**necessity of seeking** and **using state power** to address structural
inequality and collective fate]{.underline}.48

Complex and generative tensions are lost, then, as Moten [[recovers the
**freedom schools**]{.mark} organized [by Fannie Lou Hamer but **not her
organizing** for the **right to**]{.mark} **vote**, to
**[exercise]{.mark} popular sovereignty locally**]{.underline},
especially around police and schools, [but also to create a
"**Mississippi Freedom [Democratic]{.mark} Party**" that entered
national [politics]{.mark}. Hamer (like the Black Panthers and Black
Lives Matter) models how black radicalism has lived in an **interval**
between the]{.underline} tacit grammar and [ongoing "**planning**" of
black fugitivity]{.underline}---as loopholes of retreat practiced and
concealed in plain sight---[and **flagrant publicity** as **fugitive
democracy**]{.underline}. Whereas for Moten, the historical failure or
defeat of outward-facing public action proves the futility of fugitive
democracy, I would ask: "what if" we follow his own fugitive view that
any being or act is both incomplete and excessive, to infer that
[[specific historical experiments are **not definitive failures**, but
**unfinished** ]{.mark}**in meaning**, [examples we could **retrieve**
and **refashion**]{.mark} now? If keeping open such possibility **risks
cruel optimism**, foreclosing it **reifies the impasse** he]{.underline}
generatively [transvalues]{.underline} in so many other ways.

Work", February 2017,
<http://aadhum.umd.edu/2017/02/centralizing-blackness-digital-work/>
///ghs-sc)

In my own research[, I am drawn to Christina Sharpe's conception of
"wake work." **[Wake work does not]{.mark} seek to [amend Black
suffering through]{.mark} the frames of juridical, philosophical, or
[historical solutions.]{.mark}** Wake work theorizes Black life in both
the "wake" and the "hold" of the slave ship]{.underline}, requiring
recognition "of the ways that we are constituted through and by
vulnerability to overwhelming force, though not only known to ourselves
and to each other by that force." This is critical Black study that does
not seek to make room for the full scope of Black humanity to be
recognized by the white consciousness. Rather, it works to "defend the
dead" through the cultivation of a 'blackened consciousness' that would
inhabit the ways that we are both living and dying in the wake. In my
own digital humanities work centered in New Orleans, 11 years after the
storm, this means staring unflinchingly at the political, economic, and
intellectual assemblages that over-determine Black life/death, while
simultaneously understanding how insurgent Black social life can
undermine these over-determinations. Is digital wake work possible? If
so, what can it look like? That is the question that I intend to work
through as a researcher within the AADHum Initiative. If it is indeed
true that, as Moya Z. Bailey says, "All the Digital Humanists Are White,
All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave," then it's time to
say---in the words of Jonathan P. Jackson---"Gentlemen, we will be
taking over from here." In our work, how can we discover and further
develop digital lines of escape, made possible by the apertures that
emerge at the collision of Black Studies and the digital humanities? We
who would build: Re-visioning resistance & theorizing beyond the gaze
---Jovonne Bickerstaff, Ph.D. We have two hands: one is to battle, one
is to build. We battle. We resist by calling out threats to our dignity
by name. We build. We actively protect our dignity by creating what
works. Those two hands may be on one person, one organization may be set
up to do both. For others, they are the battling or the building kind.
Either way, the battlers need the builders. The builders need the
battlers. This is a discipline of resistance. ---Brittany Packnett,
activist Outlining her concept of "Black studies in the wake," Christina
Sharpe emphasizes its call "to be at the intellectual work of a
continued reckoning the longue of Atlantic chattel slavery, with black
fungibility, antiblackness... accounting for the narrative, historical,
structural, and other positions black people are forced to occupy."
Drawing on Alexander Weheliye, Kim Gallon, by contrast, characterizes
Black Studies as "a mode of knowledge production" that "investigates
processes of racialization with a particular emphasis on the shifting
configurations of black life." Building on the Duboisian tradition of
intellectual activism that advances scholarship while furthering social
justice, both suggest that the real and vital work on black people
necessarily speaks to race---that is, analyzing the consequences of and
resistance to the project of racialization. [I can see how interrogating
the racial project of whiteness that shapes black folks' lives can be a
way of speaking truth to power for African Americanist scholars. Still,
[focusing]{.mark} so [acutely on unpacking racism]{.mark} and
racialization [as]{.mark} sole or [primary path of resistance gives me
pause]{.mark}. I wonder if [we've framed what Black Studies
does]{.mark}---and more importantly can do---**[too narrowly]{.mark}**.
Might [our pre-occupation with black struggle]{.mark}, whether in the
conditions of or resistance to oppression, **[make us complicit in the
diminishing the fullness of black humanity]{.mark}** and what we might
explore in it? [Can we imagine examining black experience without making
America's racialization project the dominant idiom?]{.mark}]{.underline}
Recently, activist Brittany Packnett developed a Twitter thread which
began, "**[[We have two hands: one is to battle, one is to
build]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Certainly, we African Americanists know
how to battle. So much of our training as scholars prepares us for it;
we're socialized to privilege the work of critique and deconstruction.
Given how black folk have been conceptualized or written out of cannons,
[our [proclivity towards confrontational debate may be]{.mark} more
[pronounced]{.mark}. We feel the pulse of that resistance when Gallon
characterizes Black Studies as "the comparative study of the black
cultural and social experiences under white Eurocentric systems of
power." [But... is that enough? Is our conception of black scholarly
resistance too narrow?]{.mark}]{.underline} Taking Packnett's call for a
multifaceted strategy of resistance to heart, I must ask, when do we
build? These questions are central to who I've become as a scholar.
Surely, I do my share of confrontational resistance, interrogating
problematic paradigms, particularly when I teach. Still, as my research
agenda solidifies, **[[I'm more compelled by that call to
build]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Centering black experience has been my
entry point for moving beyond critique to imagine new narratives and
inquiry to engage in what I term theorizing beyond gaze---orienting my
own work and my hopes for the AADHum Initiative. "From my perspective
there are only black people. When I say "people", that's what I mean...
No African American writer had ever done what I did... even the ones I
admired... I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not
writing about white people... As though our lives have no meaning and no
depth without the white gaze. And I have spent my entire writing life
trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one ... I
didn't have to be consumed by or concerned by the white gaze... The
problem of being free to write the way you wish to without this other
racialized gaze is a serious one for an African American writer"
\[emphasis added\]. ---Toni Morrison Freedom for her, Nina Simone once
quipped, was the absence of fear. As a scholar and writer, my vision of
freedom is more akin to Toni Morrison's and begins with one radical
tool: choice. I name, frame, and lay claim to different terrains:
examining understudied populations (couples in enduring relationships),
raising novel questions (how emotional strategies for resilience impact
intimacy), and situating my research in unorthodox literatures
(sociology of emotions vs. "the black family"). In every case, each
she/he/they that I describe is, by default, black. Refusing to
explicitly qualify race in work on black people can be jarring because
having non-white experiences centered is so rare. [In addition to
disturbing notions of black folks as the perpetual other, theorizing
beyond the gaze forces us to recognize how failing to fully account for
positionality undermines our theorizing.]{.underline} [If we uphold
confrontation as the primary or most effective tool of resistance, I
fear [we risk neglecting how resistance requires and]{.mark} has always
[relied]{.mark} as much [on]{.mark} subversive tactics like [theorizing
beyond the gaze as on direct action]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the AADHUM
initiative, I hope that helps us think through how can we begin to
construct a "meaningful intellectual and activist challenge that
circumvents the analyses of injustice that re-isolate the dispossessed,
à la McKittrick's invocation of Gilmore. It'd be easy (and reductive) to
see black Twitter simply as an offshoot of mainstream Twitter use. But
what if we saw it instead as innovation narrative, à la Steve Jobs and
iPods and iPhones, whereby they're responsible for optimizing technology
use in ways that reveal its fullest potential? Or conversely, could we
invert the arrows of co-optation, which typically focuses on stolen
African American products, to reveal how communities of color used

**Anti-blackness doesn't corrupt all ethics.**

Naomi **Zack 17**. University of Oregon. 03/07/2017. Review of Stain
Removal: Ethics and Race. Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,
https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/stain-removal-ethics-and-race/.

Miller begins by [[claiming]{.mark} that there cannot be]{.underline} an
[ethics of race because]{.underline} an [ethics of
**anything**]{.underline} [presupposes that its **subject**]{.underline}
[can be **perceived**]{.underline} or correctly described [in
some]{.underline} \"factual\" or [value-neutral way]{.underline},
because it is \"outside\" of ethics. [But race is]{.underline}
**[already evaluative]{.underline}** (evaluated) [throughout the modern
period]{.underline}, beginning systematically in philosophy with Kant\'s
ordinal (ranked, with whites first) taxonomy of human races. Miller\'s
insistence that race is already inexorably evaluative is based on his
emphasis of the importance of myths about the transfer of value through
heredity and physical embodiment. Physical embodiment is the object of
perception, so that racial identities are what Bernard Williams has
called \"prejudicial objects.\" Miller claims that [value-laden myths
about race have **criminalized some** human bodies]{.underline} in a
tradition of \"blessing and curses.\" [By contrast, and in
**opposition**, **Enlightenment** ideas about moral responsibility made
it possible for]{.underline} individual **[autonomy]{.underline}** [in
a]{.underline} **[single lifetime]{.underline}** \-- the individual
creates her own fate through choices. [[Ethics]{.mark} is
thereby]{.underline} born, but only [in]{.underline}
**[opposition]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} the tradition of
**[hereditary]{.underline}** blessings and [**curses**. And the ethical
tradition of individual responsibility **[requires]{.mark}** the
tradition **against which it reacted**, as well as those who remain
identified with the \"blessing and curses\" tradition, that is,
**[racialized \"others.\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} Miller outlines these
core ideas in his Introduction. In chapter 1, he argues that ethical
emphases on deeds neglect accompanying evaluations of the agent. Chapter
2 considers how subjectivity could be \"reconfigured\" in terms of
affiliative relations that transfer value, when awareness of what is
determined could operate as a \"circuit breaker\" on the forces
determining value (pp. 77-8). Chapters 3 and 4 are an analysis of
ancient Greek and early Christian thought about the origination of value
and ethical knowledge as part of the natural world. Here, Miller shows
how value first emerged after action was deemed criminal, a structure
that is proto-typical for the historical emergence of race. Miller\'s
Conclusion is not a \"happy ending,\" because ethical inheritance still
dominates the subject seeking freedom and nothing, not even a reversal
of existing racial power structures, can undo the past. Miller ends with
a passage by James Baldwin which expresses a tension between acceptance
of cursed/criminalized inheritance in the first paragraph and a thirst
for vengeance in the second: The custodian of an inheritance, which is
what blacks have had to be, in Western culture, must hand the
inheritance down the line. So, you, the custodian, recognize, finally
that your life does not belong to you: nothing belongs to you. This will
not sound like freedom to Western ears, since the Western world pivots
on the infantile, and, in action, criminal delusions of possession, and
of property. . . . But the people of the West will not understand this
until everything which they now think they have has been taken away from
them. In passing, one may observe how remarkable it is that a people so
quick and so proud to boast of what they have taken from others are
unable to imagine that what they have taken from others can also be
taken from them. (p. 171) The controversy I predicted at the start of
this review is unlikely to unite moral philosophers and philosophers of
race, because both traditional moral philosophers and progressive
anti-racist philosophers will recognize a fundamental criticism of their
entire enterprise in this work. Enigmatic questions are raised for both
groups of scholars: [[Is race such a]{.underline} **[fundamental
category]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of human existence [that it
**overrides**]{.mark}]{.underline} basic assumptions about [[how
we]{.underline}]{.mark} can develop our characters and [[regard
others?]{.mark} Can the]{.underline} **[historical
contingency]{.underline}** [of race **override**]{.underline} the
**[more important]{.underline}** concerns and **[projects]{.underline}**
[involving]{.underline} **[character]{.underline}** development and
assessment**[?]{.underline}** [How does the importance of what we now
take to be ethical concerns and projects compare with the power of the
value-imbued]{.underline} **[ontology]{.underline}** [of
race?]{.underline} [[If race is]{.mark} already [embedded in]{.mark}
racial]{.underline} [[**ontology**, why]{.mark} is it [not]{.mark}
possible to]{.underline} [**[resolve that circularity through careful
analysis]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} **[recognizes]{.underline}**
[this]{.underline}]{.mark} [problem, [without seeking
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[purify racial
ontology]{.underline}**]{.mark} as it is commonly taken to be?
[[Philosophers of race]{.underline}]{.mark} might [already
recognize]{.underline} the [morally bad aspects]{.underline} of race
throughout history [and advocate mourning]{.underline} and memorial, [as
well as resolve to [resist]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[morally bad
aspects of race in their]{.mark} own [discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
fact, most philosophers of race who seek to retain racial categories
proceed exactly in that way. [[Similarly, ethicists could]{.mark} take
special care to [cultivate **awareness**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of how
**their moral prescriptions**]{.underline}]{.mark} and systems
**[[exclude]{.underline}]{.mark}** or already criminalize
**[[nonwhites]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Although]{.underline}, as noted,
[Miller]{.underline} [**[claims]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} **[enterprise of
[ethics]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is **impossible**]{.underline}
[without]{.underline}]{.mark} **[nonwhite]{.underline}** **[[racial
others]{.underline}]{.mark}** who are [[already
considered]{.underline}]{.mark} morally bad or [[not qualified to be
ethical subjects]{.underline}]{.mark} or objects, [[he has given
**little support for this sweeping assertion**. Surely, the
**abolitionist movement**]{.underline}]{.mark} against slavery, [white
[supporters of]{.mark}]{.underline} the U.S. **[[civil
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}** movement, [[and]{.mark} international
[humanitarian discourse **disturb** that
generalization]{.mark}]{.underline}, if only [[as an **empirical
matter**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Finally, although Miller resists
addressing race as racism, [it is difficult to understand how his
analysis of race as a stain that cannot be removed from ethics and his
analysis of ethics as **ineradicably white**]{.underline} (or not
nonwhite) [does]{.underline} **[not amount to deep
analysis]{.underline}** of anti-nonwhite racism. Miller\'s book is a
short, dense, brilliant, and fascinating work that is very important for
its historical and phenomenological depth of analysis. Miller\'s
analysis proceeds by unveiling or positing a horrible but compelling
prophecy that to remove ideas of nonwhite race as curse would also
remove the need for ethics. The question is whether there would be
interest in taking responsibility if some individuals were no longer
burdened by hereditary criminalization. [[The]{.underline}
**[illogic]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of this question, [that A is

**Raengo 17**. Alessandra. Associate Professor of Moving Image Studies,
Georgia State University and coordinator of liquid blackness, a research
project on blackness and aesthetics. "Dreams are colder than Death and
the Gathering of Black Sociality." Black Camera 8(2): 120-36. Emory
Libraries.

Arthur Jafa\'s 2013 essay film Dreams are colder than Death begins as a
lyrical meditation on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.\'s \"I have a
dream\" speech conducted through interviews with African-American
intellectuals---the specialists, as Jafa calls them---such as Hortense
Spillers, Fred Moten, Saidiya Hartman, and Nicole Fleetwood; filmmaker
Charles Burnett; ex--Black Panther and professor Kathleen Clever;
musician Flying Lotus; and visual artists Kara Walker and Wangechi Mutu,
among others.1 Quickly, however, the film detours toward more
fundamental and open-ended questions, \[End Page 120\] such as \"What is
the concept of blackness? Where did it come from? And what does it mean
for people of color living in America today?\"

Weaving together lyrical slow-motion images of black people---the
uncommon folks---mostly in outdoor spaces hanging out, walking around,
or talking to one another, with images of dark waters or deep space, the
film creates a tapestry within which the voices of some of the most
powerful contemporary black artists and thinkers engage in a meditation
on the ontology of blackness and its relationship to life, death, and
the concept of the human in the context of the \"afterlife of
slavery.\"2

[[That]{.mark} the social existence of [blackness has to be understood
within]{.mark} the context of [the]{.mark} \"[afterlife of
slavery]{.mark}\" [is]{.mark} the position [held by]{.mark} scholars
that identify with the conversation described as
[Afro-Pessimism]{.mark}]{.underline},3 [[while the ascendance of]{.mark}
the \#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter movement, [founded
by]{.mark} three **[queer women]{.mark}**---Alicia Garza, Patrisse
Cullors, and Opal Tometi---can be seen to [**vindicate** the
\"**Afro-Optimist**\" position that affirms]{.mark} instead [the]{.mark}
primacy, vibrancy, and [generative capacity of black social
life]{.mark}.]{.underline}4

To be sure, this opposition stands more strongly in the eyes of critics
of Afro-Pessimism than those of its supporters, as Jared Sexton has
recently articulated in his article \"Afro-Pessimism: The Unclear
Word,\" where he describes Afro-Pessimism as an ars vita \"because it
emerges from within a global catastrophe so total that the creation or
production of a black poetry, a black art, a stylization of the black
body, a black sense of place cannot but be invented wholesale \[. . .\]
without a future promising anything different or, rather, better.\"5 In
what, to date, is the most explicit alignment of the goals of
Afro-Pessimism with those of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, the
overarching question Afro-Pessimism, as an art vita, poses then becomes,
\"How do we create a world where black lives matter, to everyone or,
rather, to everyone else as well? What economies---political, libidinal,
symbolic---must be destroyed or negated, what others forged or
affirmed?\"6

The film addresses this issue through the words of [Moten]{.underline},
who [asks]{.underline}, [\"[When you say that black people are just an
effect of slavery you raise a question:]{.mark}]{.underline} can black
people be loved? Not desired, not wanted, not acquired, not lusted after
. . . [[can blackness be loved?]{.mark}\"]{.underline} By posing this
question, especially in the current context within which the intimacy
between blackness and death has become increasingly obscenely clear, the
film holds these apparent opposites in suspension.7

This essay reads Dreams as the aesthetic articulation of the fact of
black love. The film\'s structure, I argue, effectively performs the
very [[networks of solidarity]{.mark}, grief, [and grievance]{.mark}
that [are]{.mark} some of the [goals of]{.mark}
\#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter]{.underline}.8 In other
words, my reading finds in the film\'s edits---which I approach as
passages, as I will explain below---the expression of its own
[[balancing]{.underline}]{.mark} act between the commemoration of a
speech so closely associated with [**[fantasies of
equality]{.underline}**]{.mark} and freedom, and the philosophical and
artistic decision to frame \[End Page 121\] it through the concept of
death.9 In other words, the decision is to approach all this **[[from
the midst of an ongoing genocide]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a place [where
the dream has given way to the coldness of an endless
deferral]{.underline}, to the solitude of a corpse abandoned too long in
the middle of the street.10

The film holds these two poles in balance while reflecting on their
implications: on the one hand, the recognition, as Spillers puts it in
the film, that slavery is such a powerful and huge phenomenon that in
some ways it is still present---a statement we hear over an image of
dark waters---and, on the other hand, the repeated association of
blackness with images of galaxies and deep space, which, instead, affirm
its life-giving force and cosmic reach. Through its aesthetic
\"liquidity\"---i.e., the way in which it enacts unobstructed and yet
unprecedented \"passages\" between seemingly disparate and incongruous
concepts and situations, as well as the facility with which it travels
across scale, from the molecular to the celestial---the film connects
experiences of personal grief to the expression of grievance, to
reflections on the challenges blackness poses to the conception of the
human subject and her freedom. It performs, in other words, what Sexton
describes as a series of conceptual moves \"from the empirical to the
structural or, more precisely, from the experiential to the political
ontological.\"11

One methodological premise of this essay is that the film\'s edits have
to be regarded as types of passages, that is, as very similar, at least
in spirit, to those L.A. Rebellion filmmaker Larry Clark adopted in his
film Passing Through (1977). For years, Jafa has been \"obsessed\" about
this cult film that, by many accounts, has successfully transposed the
compositional principles of jazz improvisation into filmmaking and thus
reached a powerful synergy between free jazz and film form.12 In his
work, Clark leverages the adventurous expansiveness of free jazz to
connect, and therefore pass through, a variety of seemingly incongruous
or remote spaces, making adjacent, for example, sites of artistic
improvisation and sites of systemic oppression, spaces of addiction and
spaces of healing, the US racial scene and Third World revolutionary
struggles. These very passages, which Jafa has carefully studied since
his time at Howard University, which had purchased a print of the film
through his mentor Haile Gerima, are precisely what joins so essentially
the aesthetics and politics of the film. They also stand as testimony
that [blackness requires incredibly capacious frameworks to gather and
comprehend its audacious transitions.]{.underline}

Thus, methodologically speaking, this essay interprets the film\'s
editing structure---beautifully executed by Dreams\' producer and editor
Kahlil Joseph---and, in particular, the elements that the film posits as
adjacent, as indices of [[the network of love and care that]{.mark}
\#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter also [seeks]{.mark} to
establish as a way to [counteract state-sanctioned antiblack
violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The balance that Dreams performs between the thinking of life and the
thinking of death is also attained by the particular way in which the
film \[End Page 122\] dislodges some of the very conditions for black
surveillance by having voices disjointed from bodies, faces made hardly
legible because shot against intense natural light sources and a
pervasive use of slow motion that creates a sense of another space, an
alternative---perhaps suspended---dimension, and different sets of
expectations and constraints, within which black bodies can move at
their own chosen pace.13

This image/sound disjunction, whereby the interviewees\' voices are
strategically recorded independently from the image, establishes its own
passages connecting otherwise distant or disparate things, including the
passage from the \"particular universal\" of the queer identities of
#BlackLivesMatter\'s founders to the capaciously collective (\"All Black
Lives Matter\" is the claim on their website) and, by extension \"all
people,\" which is one of the main guiding ideas of the
#BlackLivesMatter movement.14 It is in this way, I will show, that the
film claims for blackness an expansiveness and intelligence that reaches
across space and time and therefore can be seen to attain its own
"fugitivity," a line of escape, as [Moten describes]{.underline} it, [an
optimistic thinking \"on the run,\"]{.underline} rendered here, in
Melissa Louidor\'s words, as [a \"mobilization of Black
vitality]{.underline}, in which biomechanic and metaphysical forces are
deployed to activate effort; an effort that is [[integral to claiming
survival.]{.mark}\"]{.underline}15

Dis-joining and Re-joining

The study of filmic movement and sound has been a central preoccupation
for Jafa since his collaboration with Julie Dash in Daughters of the
Dust (1991). For years he researched ways to bring \"intonation and
inclination down to actual movement\" and to manipulate motion in
concordance with black people\'s handshakes---that is, to find a
different integrity and comfort or ease between black sound and black
body, black image and black motion.16 For this film, he decided to
record the sound of the interviews separately from their images, which
are consistently overexposed or shot at oddly tilted and unusual angles,
or in extreme close-up, so that the faces might be present but not
necessarily legible, and legibility quickly becomes irrelevant anyway
(fig. 1).

There are two main reasons for this choice. First, the decision not to
use direct sound in his practice came in part as a matter of production
circumstances. Early on, after his experience on the set of Charles
Burnett\'s My Brother\'s Wedding (1983), shot on location in Watts, Jafa
realized that if he wanted to film in black neighborhoods, he would have
to add sound in post-production: as he explained, black neighborhoods
have all kinds of environmental noises that cannot be put on hold. He
adopted this practice because of his commitment to working on location,
with nonprofessional actors, to cast against (the industrial) grain, on
the footsteps of neorealist filmmakers. \[End Page 123\]

At the same time, Jafa\'s decision about sound recording performs a
powerful critique of the problem of forced coherence between black voice
and black body that has been a staple of the film industry since
Hollywood\'s transition to sound.17 This is what he has attempted to
reproduce by casting from the streets: for example, the possibility to
choose on the basis of people\'s natural movements and then pair them in
postproduction with someone whose voice has the right sound. This
affords the possibility to combine various voices to produce transgender
sounds, ultimately, as he describes it, to take the same liberties with
sound and voice that black musicians have historically taken with their
music. In many ways, this is a particularly \"black move\" in the sense
that this disarticulation of image and sound performs a critique of the
very properties of self-possession that constitute \"the existential
issue for Black Americans.\"18

While, on the one hand, as Kahlil Joseph also confirmed, separate sound
recording creates a different comfort zone where people can speak
freely, without being policed by the camera, it also affords a different
rendering of aural style in the sense that ultimately the sound of what
one says, as well as the posture and movements that go with it, might
have a deeper stylistic mark than the specific content of what is being
said.19 Movement, including the movement induced by editing, in other
words, might attempt to translate a speaking style, or the sound design
might strive to render the texture of a stroll, and so on.

To push this strategic disconnection and reconnection between sound and
image even further, at some point the interviewers---i.e., Jafa or Greg
\[End Page 124\] Tate---asked the interviewees what were the things they
truly believed. Recorded independently from the image, the interviewees
express themselves rather freely. As a result, the film is punctuated
with exceptionally powerful statements---\" I know that . . . I know
that\"---one of which opens the film. This knowledge, the film argues,
is a combination of knowing, feeling, and believing; it is ultimately
what Moten describes as a type of knowing \"under the rubric of faith,\"
which he considers to be the theological component of Black Studies.
Even more profoundly, this knowledge is the expression of a \"thinking
\[that is\] irreducible in blackness,\" a statement that is overlaid to
the image of a filament spectacularly detaching from the sun (fig. 2).

Black Flesh

The film opens with a quasi-still and fairly flat image of a young man
slowly turning his head right to left while also looking into the
camera, as Spillers\'s voice is heard making a commanding and
unconditional assertion: \"I know that.\" Her voice continues over the
image of a backward movement: we see young men somersaulting out of
(instead of into) a swimming pool in slow motion, their bodies remaining
temporarily suspended in midair: \"We are going to lose this gift of
black culture unless we are careful,\" she elaborates, \"this gift that
is given to people who don\'t have a prayer.\" Her \[End Page 125\]
voice screeches for emphasis around the word \"prayer\" and is cued to
the frozen close-up of one of the young men in the pool who looks
intensely at the camera (fig. 3). \[End Page 126\]

Juxtaposed to two lynching images, Spillers\'s in Selma voice continues:
\"beat our skins off our bodies; kill and rape our mamas in front of
us.\" As she repeats for the last time that \"we didn\'t have a
prayer,\" the film\'s first \"abstract\" image appears, possibly the
picture of a molecular structure, with clearly visible filaments and
small translucent masses; it is an image enigmatic enough that it
suggests a dimension blackness possesses that does not necessarily
belong to the phenomenological world but rather expands unbound across
scale (fig. 4).

Spillers continues over slow motion images of people walking down the
street:

Now we are heads of international courts, President of the United
States, we sit in the United States Supreme Court, Presidents of
Universities, CEO of American Express. . . . Some black person is it.

But the price of that is to lose this precious insight that connects you
to something human and bigger than white folks---I don\'t give a fuck
what color the folk---something bigger than that.

We are losing that connection because we are buying this other shit.

\"I know that. I know that,\" she concludes over increasingly hazy
images of semi-opaque glass panes at dusk, as the camera is looking onto
trees and green outside (fig 5).

Here transparency is blocked in favor of an emphasis, not on the haptic
properties of these images, but rather on their \"intransitive\"
character---they \[End Page 127\] don\'t convey any clear and readable
relation to what she is saying, they don\'t lead anywhere else---so that
they can also be \"arresting\" and create a moment of philosophical
suspension.

After a fade to black, one of the filmmakers explains in voice-over how
Dreams began as an assessment of \"the roles and ambitions of the Civil
Rights Movement in the United States,\" fifty years after Martin Luther
King Jr.\'s speech to gather \"thoughts and conversations of an America
that is rarely heard.\" These words unfold over two images of deep space
and a close-up of colorful light reflections on dark waters that show
all the chroma of the visible spectrum, as if slipping into blackness
and back to color, from color into blackness. (fig. 6).

The voice-over continues:

\"In the process the filmmakers discovered even a more fundamental set
of questions: What is the concept of blackness? Where did it come from?
And what does it mean for people of color living in America today?\" The
last question is posed over the image of a black star-child that fades
into the title, Dreams are colder than Death, while the sound design
bears an outer-space quality reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey (dir.
Stanley Kubrick, 1969).

This transition embodies the connection with something bigger that
Spillers described earlier. It is also steeped in Jafa\'s admiration for
Stanley Kubrick\'s film, which he saw when he was ten and which provided
him with \"a model for how powerful art could be.\"20 Despite being
initially utterly puzzled by 2001, he eventually understood his
fascination with the \"glacial pageantry\" of the film in part because a
\"nascent melancholy\" emerged as he began to recognize \"categorical
constraints\" dictated by his blackness. Yet, he also registered the
\"transfixing\" and \"unprecedented blackness\" of the inhabitants of
the Mississippi Delta region where he grew up, including their \[End
Page 128\] \"arresting beauty and dense corporeal being,\" which he
ultimately described as \"the dark matter of black being.\"21 In this
context, he read 2001\'s horror vacui as animated by a profound fear of
\"black being contaminating white being, which, by the very nature of
the self-imposed fragile ontological construction of white being, equals
the annihilation of white being.\"22

Yet, what happens when the dark matter of black being, rather than the
atavistic whiteness of 2001, is placed at the center of the textual
system?23

One way Jafa attempts this radical recalibration is through Spillers\'s
influential notion of the flesh. She discusses how her sister was
subjected to a partial amputation and yet continued to feel an
excruciating pain in her phantom leg, as if her pain remembered, so to
speak, the part of the leg that was no longer there. She calls this
\"flesh memory\" in a manner that echoes Elizabeth Alexander\'s argument
in her article \"Can You Be Black and Look at This?,\" that is, the idea
that there is a bodily archive of practical memory that is reactivated
at the moment of collective spectatorship of the black body in pain.24
For Spillers, the flesh results from the \"theft of the body\" that
occurs in the Middle Passage.25 It is also a way to describe, as
Alexander Weheliye has done, the ungendering inscription of domination
onto the biopolitical dimension of the slave body as well as the
slave\'s availability as raw material.26

\"We were available in the flesh to the slave master,\" her voice-over
explains, \"immediate; hands on,\" and these words are layered over a
slowmotion image of a woman crossing the street. \"I can pluck your
nappy head from wherever it is. Bang!,\" Spillers continues. The sound
of her \"Bang!\" is cued to the image of the same woman, who now turns
in slow motion toward the camera with a puzzled and inquisitive look, as
if reacting to Spillers\'s mimicked slap (fig. 7). \[End Page 129\]

\"How many kids you have here? Bang! Bang!\" Spillers continues.

This layering establishes a call-and-response between the scholar\'s
voice and the \"uncommon people\" it is laid over by moving through the
\"passage\" that this very layering produces and toward **[[the
experience of the flesh as a source of empathy]{.mark}; it also
[reinforces the]{.mark} very [connection that Spillers worries might be
lost]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Not only does the empathy of the flesh, as rendered here, vividly
materialize the network of solidarity, grief, and grievance that
#BlackLivesMatter supports, but it locates it within a cosmic
context]{.underline}. As Spillers introduces the concept of empathy, the
film transitions from a close shot of her face temporarily obscured by
foliage as she is walking under a tree, to a shot of the word \"TERROR\"
carved on a black man\'s chest---a quite literal representation of
Spiller\'s concept of the \"hieroglyphics of the flesh\"---to an image
of the Centaurus galaxy. [The flesh here is what binds people who
slavery deprived of their \"body,\" and yet, this passage suggests, it
is also, possibly, cosmic black matter]{.underline}.

The Dark Matter of Black Being

Key to Jafa\'s understanding of the \"dark matter of black being\" in
2001 is the fact that the monolith is a sentient black object, although
its blackness, as well as its perfectly smooth and polished modernist
surface, might ultimately obscure this very sentience.27 In Christina
Sharpe\'s words, black sentience, just like black pain, is
\"anagrammatical blackness,\" an \"index of violability,\" which also
means, as Calvin Warren explains, that the metaphysical violences
directed at black lives \"are indecipherable because they constitute a
non-sense sign within the grammar of redress and humanism.\" While
unreadable to the outside, they are affectively felt, where affect
provides \"form for an experience anti-blackness places outside
ethics.\"28 Drawing on Hortense Spillers\'s field-defining essay
\"Mama\'s Baby, Papa\'s Maybe: An American Grammar Book,\" one of the
issues both Afro-Pessimism and #BlackLivesMatter insist on is the need
to find an appropriate grammar for black pain. If \"suffering,\" as
Sexton puts it, is a \"simple enough term for withstanding the ugliness
of the world---and learning from it---\[then\] Afro-Pessimism is, among
other things, an attempt to formulate an account of such suffering, to
establish the rules of its grammar.\"29

Black sentience and suffering are appropriate \"black matter\" for the
type of knowledge and flesh memory on which Dreams insists. Saidiya
Hartman, for example, shares her relationship with premature death: how
she knows too many people who died young, including all the guys she had
crushes on in her youth. Similarly, she knows her life could end at any
\[End Page 130\] minute because of an act of gratuitous violence. The
social existence of blackness, she says, is one of \"intimacy with
death.\"30 Yet images of human suffering in the film are all historical
rather than contemporary, and even this latter statement happens in
conjunction with an image of a mother and three girls absorbed in their
own thoughts, walking in slow motion toward the camera (fig. 8).

Horizontal passages such as this one register as assertions of the equal
preciousness, and equal enigma, of all black lives. They establish
affective links and therefore enact what Sharpe might call \"wake work\"
and which Warren would describe as \"black care.\"

At the same time, and overall, they can be seen as a form of gathering
in a way that stages also the \"Thingness of blackness\" in the
Heideggerian sense that Moten follows in his essay \"The Case of
Blackness.\" There, he claims for blackness that status of Thing, a
\"gathering as contested matter\"---both Sache, that is, gathering, and
Ding, that is, the \"matter under discussion\"---a thingness that pours
out of the object, and, like troubled air, escapes from its vestibule.
This \"breath,\" he argues, this outflowing of \"stolen life,\"
describes the ontological vitality of blackness---its unbound and
ungraspable Thingness---as a constitutive and dangerous supplementarity,
a \"transplanted organ, always eliciting rejection.\"31

This type of gathering, as Sarah Cervenak similarly writes in her
reading of Leonardo Drew\'s sculptures, \"ceremoniously aestheticizes
rejectable life, making way for the im/proper regard of its
unencroachable (always \[End Page 131\] unfigurable) value.\"32 Thus, in
this gathering of the \"dark matter of black being\" across scale---from
the microscopic to the cosmic---as well as horizontally, Dreams too
institutes the [[networks of care]{.mark} that [transform]{.mark}
\#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter [from a concept to a
movement]{.mark}, insofar as [in their]{.mark} very [gathering, black
lives acquire \"the weightedness of being]{.mark}]{.underline} \[which\]
comes through precisely through a kind of deregulated togetherness.\"33

Indeed, structurally speaking, the film can be regarded as an archival
\"gathering\" of still and moving images---both archival and
contemporary images, found and original, recognizable and
unrecognizable---[[which include]{.mark} footage of the interviewees as
well as other [people]{.mark} who are not named, [whose connection to
the speaking voices is not known]{.mark}]{.underline} and cannot be
guessed.

The film features a number of still images that also appear on
APEX_TNEG, a \"proof of concept\" piece, originally developed with Malik
Sayeed, in which still images quickly flash by in a variety of different
orders and combinations. Jafa has modified this montage several times
over the years, and it follows rather closely Jafa\'s \"collecting\"
practice and his sense that individual elements acquire a measure of
additional density just by virtue of being gathered together.34

A great part of the film\'s gathering occurs in the \"bosom\" of the
cosmos itself. When Rich Blint asks, \"How do you know that you are free
without captivity?\" his question is posed over a stunning image of
Saturn\'s moon Dione (fig. 9).35 \[End Page 132\]

The image of the NGC 3621 Galaxy shown while Nicole Fleetwood explains
that \"there is something unique about black expressive culture\" also
underscores this dimension. We can say that anagrammatical blackness
reappears here but this time as an index of potentiality, \"blackness
anew, blackness as a/temporal, in and out of place and time putting
pressure on meaning and that against which meaning is made.\"36 More
specifically, this Galaxy is believed to have a system of three black
holes at its center, one of which is active and swallows matter while
producing radiation.37

Fleetwood explains that she was raised with a working-class black female
religious sensibility, and that, at the church where her grandmother was
the music director, it was music, and not the sermon, that would drive
the service. Indeed, music acted as a mechanism capable of generating
energy. Her words are laid over images in part inspired by Hart Leroy
Bibbs\'s Manifesto Optksorption, a 1977 collection of poems and
long-exposure photographs of jazz musicians as they are playing. The
traces of the musicians\' movements linger around their figures as
squiggles of light that blur the figures\' contours, arguably one of the
closest photographic counterparts to the \"intensities\" that traverse
Francis Bacon\'s paintings, which Deleuze discussed to illustrate the
\"logic of sensation\" (fig. 10).38

Jafa knows Bibbs\'s work, and he too has been making similar images
because he is equally invested in the energizing and expansive intensity
of black music. A similar jazz image comes back during Moten\'s
discussion of blackness as a critique of ownership and of the proper.
\"We have been placed in a position that requires us to break the law,
to disobey,\" Moten explains, and \[End Page 133\] thus blackness
displays an irreducible relation between law making and law breaking,
legality and criminality. Not contingently, but historically: during
slavery, he elaborates, black gathering was illegal. Yet this also means
that blackness is involved in a jurisgenerative process whereby formal
innovations are necessarily types of lawbreaking (while lawbreaking
might also always conduce to formal innovation). What Miles Davis and
John Coltrane were doing, he elaborates, was to break the very rules
that they had established the night before, while their improvisatory
acts performed a disruption of both property and propriety.

There are no imaginable circumstances within which #BlackLivesMatter
could make a similar claim. In the discourses and practices in which it
intervenes, where \"white safety equals black murder,\" criminality does
not have a philosophical meaning, but it is rather the overarching
framing within which blackness is seen to operate, before and regardless
of any actions actually taken.39 Yet, Moten and Harney insist, in an
essay devoted to Michael Brown, \"If we refuse to show the image of a
lonely body, of the outline of the space that body simultaneously took
and left, we do so in order to imagine jurisgenerative black social life
walking down the middle of the street---for a minute, but only for a
minute, unpoliced, another city gathers, dancing.\"40

Mattering Blackness

Filling the frame in extreme close-up, and barely emerging into
visibility, silhouette artist Kara Walker rubs her eyes.

\"When I work . . . I find myself in this kind schism, in this kind of
mercurial space, that is sort of non-gendered and non-raced,\" she says
over some of her most famous silhouette installations. \"My skin keeps
trying to stick itself back on. . . . I become aware of the skin and
everything that comes with it. . . . And then it comes detached, only
slightly, not all the way.\" Now an extreme close-up of her lips
occupies the left side of the frame. \"I am getting this image of
retinal detachment. The skin is literally folding away and it\'s gory
and grotesque and that\'s where I feel like when I am at home.\" Seen in
extreme close-up now, her eyelid occupies the right side of the frame
(fig. 11).

\"It is not a safe place to be,\" she continues, \"but one where you can
kind of look at the underside of race . . . what is being escaped
from.\" She proceeds: \"What is this existential horror that one can
feel about being kind of invisible . . . being kind of a heavy presence
/ a heavy non-presence?\" It is a question heard over an image of waves
hitting a shore dotted with black rocks.

The space she describes is no longer purely cosmic but also mental and
epistemological---a space for the skin to slightly detach and raciality
\[End Page 134\] to be placed in suspension. [[This is a space for the
flesh to be not the product of dispossession but]{.mark} rather [the
location of]{.mark} pure [sentience]{.mark}, one that the film
translates [through a process of mattering]{.mark}]{.underline}: from
Walker\'s actual flesh, seen from an unnaturally close proximity, as if
the camera aspired to eliminate any distance whatsoever between itself
and its profilmic subject, to \"dark waters,\" and eventually to the
extreme close-up of an older man slowly nodding his head. Here, too,
[black gathering produces weight, density, and mass.]{.underline}

Black matter gathers, Dreams shows, but also remembers. Spillers
narrates the loss of family members: her father and mother, her niece,
her nephew, and her last sibling. The details seem at first very
specific to her contingent experience; yet she claims that in this
process she discovered something she didn\'t know: \"dying is really
real. It is really nonnegotiable.\" The particular universal of her loss
traces the same network #BlackLivesMatter attempts to travel by giving
way to the capaciously collective, and beyond that, to the universal
fact of dying. All lives end. Not just black lives.

It is at this point that, through Moten\'s words, the film poses its
crucial question about loving blackness regardless of its relationship
to the after-life of slavery:

I know [there is such a thing as blackness---not an effect of
horror---it survives horror and terror. It can be loved, and it has to
be loved]{.underline}; it should be defended; it should be nurtured.
\[End Page 135\]

I know those things to be true.

I know those things.

As he explains the source and nature of his knowledge, he also affirms
the constant thinking that is \"irreducible in blackness.\" The image of
the sun mentioned at the beginning then transitions to a slow-motion
close-up of Spillers laughing broadly (fig. 12), as if exhilarated,
perhaps in passage toward a suspended lightness that springs from the
knowledge of black love.

**If we win that black relationality is possible, it disproves
pornotroping. They assume that the relationship between non-Black and
Black is SOLELY one of domination. This denies Black agency and the
history of resistance**

However, it is important to note that [while black women and girls are
impacted by superimposed pornotropic ways of being seen, a distinction
is to be drawn between identities as produced by others and identities
as appropriated and performed]{.underline} by black women and girls
themselves. Therefore, [although identities are
superimposed]{.underline} onto black women and girls' bodies, [they are
**always contested** and appropriated]{.underline}. Despite contestation
and appropriation, culturally produced and maintained ideas about
identities are also so hegemonicly determined that they appear normative
and are thus internalized. [[Although the pornotropic gaze may be
internalized, **simultaneously operating** may]{.mark} also [be their
**contestations**]{.mark}, notwithstanding how difficult resistance to
pornotropic gazing may be, particularly as they are intermeshed with
reality and as such, difficult to resist altogether]{.underline}.¶
Exploring the pornotropic gaze and its determinacy within contemporary
black religion 12 and cultural media 13 is the major aim of this
dissertation. Womanist theologians and ethicists created a
cross-pollinated theo-ethical trajectory that demarginalized and
re-presented North American black women as thinking and feeling moral
agents with experiences worthy of academic inquiry. Pivotal to their
discourse is demythologizing black womanhood and its variety of cultural
representations. However, a major proposition circulating throughout
this dissertation is that, while womanist theoethical discourse opens
space for examining North American black women's experiences and
representations, what is needed to move that discourse forward in
African American Religion14 from its dependencies on restricted analyses
of black women's experiences, methodological limitations and normative
conceptual restrictions, is an examination of the manner in which the
force of representational epistemes operate in black religion and
culture to over-determine contemporary black women and girls'
experiences within a pornotropic gaze.¶ This dissertation argues that
religious and cultural media are socially organized technologies of
power that reproduce, maintain, circulate, and exchange historical myths
on black womanhood, which black women and girls both resist and
appropriate. 15 Notwithstanding how they may be resisted or
appropriated, operative historical myths need to be deconstructed and,
in many cases, disoriented. This dissertation achieves this by "changing
the letter." "Changing the letter," which refers to the essay, "Changing
the Letter: The Yokes, the Jokes of Discourse, or, Mrs. Stowe, Mr.
Reed," written by Spillers, frames both my theory and strategy for
reading (deconstruction) and writing (retheorizing). It holds that
[words ("letters") can be manipulated ("changed") in a **variety of
ways** to tell [a story]{.mark} that [may be]{.mark} either
**[liberative]{.mark}** or oppressive ("yoke")]{.underline}. Therefore,
[[meanings are not fixed]{.underline}]{.mark}, 16 [[but]{.mark} are
**[constantly influx]{.mark}**, although sometimes appearing
stabilized]{.underline}.¶ [This]{.underline} dissertation [takes issue
with the latter perception: the ways that cultural meanings are
stabilized over time and presented as "truth."]{.underline} 17
[[Pornotropia]{.underline}]{.mark} 18 [[thrives off]{.mark} of
controlling [ideas]{.mark} that are stabilized and [taken for
granted]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The phrase, "taken for granted,"
highlights]{.underline} what Alfred Schutz and Thomas Luckmann refer to
as [un-reflected inclinations toward certain actions developed in the
'natural attitude', [which **presume**]{.mark} inter-subjective
[realities]{.mark} of the life-world [to be]{.mark} similarly
experienced or imagined, for example, the idea that there was a world
[prior to]{.mark} our [existence]{.mark}]{.underline}, made up of
subjects, objects and nature, the former of which (human subjects) are
endowed with consciousnesses that interpret meanings amongst themselves
in horizontal and cognitive ways. [[However, "reality,"]{.mark} the
conditions that we encounter, [is **mediated through
interpretation**]{.mark}, which gives rise to certain kinds of conduct
(over others), given our stock of previous experiences, either our own
or inherited]{.underline}. [Previous experiences frame our "stocks of
knowledge" and motivate our attitudes and actions toward certain ends,
given the anticipation of what is believed to be both conventional and
probable]{.underline}. 19¶ [[The "taken for granted"]{.mark} within the
'natural attitude' [neglects **critical queries** that]{.mark} might
[take up how relationships between the subject and representation might
be situated]{.mark}, or, as interpreters, how we may be positioned
towards either (or both), given attitudes]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark}
kind of thinking [leads to **reductive practices**]{.mark} such as
[reading]{.mark} one's [identity]{.mark} in light of the appearance of a
(projected) profile such [as the]{.mark} taken for granted
"black-female-aswhore" [stereotype]{.mark}, as [opposed to]{.mark} her
**[complex subjectivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The latter
enables]{.mark} a variety of [readings]{.mark}, thus **["lessening"
pornotropia]{.mark}**, which depends on the rigidity of a closed
script]{.underline}.¶ This dissertation highlights [a struggle for
truth]{.underline} that [is inextricably linked to lived
experiences]{.underline}, that is,
**[social-cultural-historical-political conditions]{.underline}**. One
aim of this dissertation is to confuse previous readings of "black
womanhood" by blasting the habits of language, linguistic and
representational, its internal signals, inferred ideologies, encodings,
and operation. These strategies enable the mass-reproduction and
continued circulation and closure of the script of black womanhood.
[Circulating myths of black womanhood need to be taken up]{.underline}.
However, [they also need to be taken up differently]{.underline} than
they have been previously in African American religion, culture, and
womanist theoethical scholarship. This dissertation explores their
deployment in religion and culture and the critiques thereof. Both
deployment and criticisms produce layers of meanings that are reproduced
and circulated. I will examine the strategies by which myths of black
womanhood travel, getting realigned and re-appropriated from generation
to generation.¶ [These moves "loosen the yoke" and decrease the jolts of
"America's Grammar Book" on race and gender]{.underline}. The following
chapters emphasize loosening the yoke, while the overall aim of this
dissertation is significantly inspired by the reality of the jolt. "The
jolt" refers to the ongoing threat of symbolic and material violence
caused by day-to-day representational terror, which is mass-produced in
and transmitted through media that "projects"20 and inform certain
opinions and attitudes regarding 'normativity' and 'difference'.

**Presenting a [strategy]{.underline} to solve [suffering]{.underline}
isn't [voyeurism]{.underline}.**

**Craps '12** \[Steph; 2012; Professor of English at Ghent University,
Director of Centre for Literature and Trauma; *Postcolonial Witnessing:
Trauma Out of Bounds*, *Palgrave*, "Conclusion," p. 126-127; GR\]

Cogent though these various critiques are in their own terms, it seems
to me that they unduly homogenize and simplify different forms of
interest in and inquiry into trauma. While it is true, of course, that
trauma research does not in and of itself lead to political
transformation, I would argue that a **[[trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}**
theory revised along the lines I have suggested [[is not]{.mark}
destined to serve as the handmaiden of the status quo or [a]{.mark} mere
academic [**alibi** for]{.mark} the indulgence of **[voyeuristic
inclinations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[it can]{.mark}
help identify and [understand]{.mark} situations of
**[exploitation]{.mark} and abuse**[, and act as]{.mark} an
[**incentive** for]{.mark} the kind of sustained and systemic [critique
of]{.mark} **societal [conditions]{.mark}** called for by Berlant and
Brown]{.underline}. In fact, [the expanded **model of [trauma]{.mark}**
I have proposed, [based on]{.mark}]{.underline} the work of Laura Brown,
Frantz [**[Fanon]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} others, bears a close
resemblance to the model of suffering that [Berlant [puts
forward]{.mark}]{.underline} as [[an
**alt**]{.mark}**ernative**]{.underline} to the (traditional) trauma
model, which she finds inadequate: \"[a model of suffering, whose
etymological [articulation of **pain**]{.mark} and patience [draws its
**subject** less as an **effect** of]{.mark} an act of [**violence** and
more as]{.mark} an effect of [a]{.mark} **general [atmosphere]{.mark}**
[of it, peppered by **acts**]{.mark}]{.underline}, to be sure, but not
contained by the presumption that trauma carries, that it is an effect
of a single scene of violence or toxic taxonomy\" (338). Berlant\'s
observation that \"the pain and suffering of subordinated subjects in
everyday life is an ordinary and ongoing thing that is underdescribed by
the (traumatic) identity form and its circulation in the state and the
law\" (344) is perfectly in line with the argument I have presented in
this book.

[That **trauma [research]{.mark}** [can act as a **catalyst**
for]{.mark} astute **[political]{.mark} analysis** and **meaningful
[activism]{.mark}**]{.underline} would seem to be borne out by the \[END
PAGE 126\] development in Fanon\'s writing, from Black Skin, White
Masks, which describes the psychological impact of racial and colonial
oppression, to the overtly political The Wretched of the Earth, which
confronts the source of the mental strife he saw in the clinic.3 Since
Douglas Crimp\'s plea for \"\[m\]ilitancy, of course, then, but mourning
too: mourning and militancy\" (18) in relation to the AIDS movement back
in 1989, several scholars have argued that an interest in issues of
[trauma, loss, and mourning is in fact compatible with a commitment to
radical activism. A desire [to make **visible** the]{.mark} creative and
[**political**-rather than **pathological**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and
negative-aspects of an [**attachment** to loss]{.mark}]{.underline} is
the thread that binds together the essays gathered in David Eng and
David Kazanjian\'s volume Loss: The Politics of Mourning (2003), which
seeks to \"extend\[\] recent scholarship in trauma studies by insisting
that ruptures of experience, witnessing, history, and truth are, indeed,
a starting point for political activism and transformation\" (10). Eng
and Kazanjian see their collection as moving \"from trauma to prophecy,
and from epistemological structures of unknowability to the politics of
mourning\" (10). As one of the contributors, Ann Cvetkovich, puts it,
[trauma can be \"the provocation [to create]{.mark} **alternative
[lifeworld's]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" (\"Legacies of Trauma\" 453).

[Recognition of suffering serves as [a]{.mark} **necessary first
[step]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}wards the [amelioration]{.mark} of that
suffering]{.underline}. In Judith Butler\'s words, \"The recognition of
[**shared [precariousness]{.mark}** [introduces]{.mark} strong
[normative]{.mark} commitments of [equality]{.mark} and invites a more
robust universalizing of rights that seeks [to address basic]{.mark}
**human [needs]{.mark}**]{.underline} for food, shelter, and other
conditions for persisting and flourishing\" (28-29). Without wishing to
overstate its likely impact, I believe that rethinking trauma studies
from a postcolonial perspective and providing nuanced readings of a wide
variety of narratives of trauma and witnessing from around the world can
help us understand that shared precariousness. By fostering attunement
to previously unheard suffering and putting into global circulation
memories of a broad range of traumatic histories, an inclusive and
culturally sensitive trauma theory can assist in [raising awareness of
injustice]{.underline} both past and present [and opening up the
possibility of a more just global future]{.underline}-and, in so doing,
remain faithful to the ethical foundations of the field.5

**[at: alt solves IR]{.underline}**

**The alt can't solve states [going to war]{.underline} AND makes
[alleviating]{.underline} "concrete human woes"
[irrelevant]{.underline}.**

**Isacoff '15** \[Jonathan; 2015; Associate Professor of Political
Science and the Chair of Environmental Studies at Gonzaga
University; *Why IR Needs Deweyan Pragmatism*, "Perspectives on
Political Science," p. 26-33; GR\]

I mean that [[what **IR is**]{.mark} **or is not** [is not]{.mark}
**nearly [as important]{.mark}** [as what it
**achieves**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So the question should not be whether
IR is scientific, but rather, how scientific does it need to be to get
the job done? To this, there are many answers, but I suggest a line of
reasoning: the scientific method in the most general sense is useful in
helping to explain how and why, all else equal, causal processes work.
Put differently, [[if we want to know]{.mark} **how and [wh]{.mark}y**
some [states **go to war**]{.mark}]{.underline} and others do not, [[it
would be]{.mark} **more [useful]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[in the sense
of [getting]{.mark} **logically [coherent]{.mark}**[,]{.mark}
**empirically [verifiable]{.mark}** [answers]{.mark}---[to
analyze]{.mark} **historical [cases]{.mark}
systematically**]{.underline} than it would be to consult with a shaman
or use a crystal ball to obtain an answer. This is not say that there is
not an important role for textual interpretation in the process of
studying war and other international phenomena. Indeed, I elsewhere
argue that interpretation of historical texts is crucial to making valid
claims about wars.47 But the main point here is that interpretation is a
means toward an end, namely, the process of coping with the world via
human experience. Toward that end, interpretation is necessary and
useful, but it is not the end itself.

A second point is that there is clearly a pragmatic and justifiable need
for certain types of quantitative methods, namely, statistics, though
not necessarily formal models, in some segments of IR. Taking a simple
example for illustrative purposes, if one wished to study the effect of
speed limits on motor vehicle fatalities, the use of aggregate data
statistically analyzed would be far superior to standing on the corner
waiting for an accident to observe or reading several diary accounts of
individual accidents. The key point here, however, is not that
statistical methods are inherently better, or more "rigorous" than any
other type of method. Rather, [[the use of]{.mark} **statistically
analyzed [data]{.mark}** to find answers to problems]{.underline} of
highway fatalities [[creates **knowledge** that]{.underline}]{.mark} if
properly applied, [**would [alleviate]{.mark}** ["concrete]{.mark}
**human [woes]{.mark},"** which is to say it would help to save lives.
[That is **pragmatic**]{.mark} **political
[science]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

48 What Is a Problem?

Many political scientists believe in the idea of having a "problem
orientation" for the field. For example, Atul Kohli asserts that there
is a strong consensus among leading experts "that comparative politics
is very much a problem-driven field of study." "What motivates the best
comparative politics research are puzzles of real-world significance,"
writes Kohli, in "The Role of Theory in Comparative Politics: A
Symposium."49 Similarly, Ian Shapiro, responding to the question of what
would be a better alternative than RCT asks the question: "What is the
phenomenon to be explained?... The formulation of alternative
explanations, in other words, should be a problem-driven activity."50
This is clearly consistent with Deweyan pragmatism; in fact, it is
inherently pragmatist. "A Deweyan pragmatic approach to political
inquiry," writes Maurice Meilleur, "would transform political science
from a discipline, based on a set of methods, into a profession, based
on a set of problems."51 But what, more specifically, is a "problem
orientation?" First, it is clear that Kohli and his colleagues mean an
empirically driven problem orientation. That is, the study of [[politics
should be driven by **empirical**, **not theoretical**]{.mark}, or
**methodological [problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Careful not to push
this point too far, a Deweyan pragmatist would suggest that theorization
is an important activity, but it must not lose its link to problems of
human experience, which is to say empirical problems. However, Kohli and
others advocating an empirically driven problem orientation have little
to say about how to identify and value problems. After all, there is a
limitless supply of political problems only a fraction of which can be
studied.

In response, I would argue that some problems are more significant to
the detection and response to human suffering and thus more deserving of
study, than others. This is itself a tricky ethical problem, for who is
to say what is or is not a "real problem?" One reader of this manuscript
suggested that "What is really going on here, when one scratches the
analytical surface, is not that IR theorists aren\'t discussing
problems; it\'s that they are discussing problems that the author does
not feel are worthy of attention. But why should we accept that the
author\'s "problems" are more important or privileged? Why does the
author get to decide what a "real" problem is?" This is a good question
but it is a misreading of the argument. Nowhere does Dewey or this
author imply that any individual could or should decide or dictate which
problems matter and which do not. To the contrary, the question of "who
decides" is a public deliberation problem, a subject Dewey addressed
exhaustively in his classic The Public and Its Problems.52 According to
Dewey, problems are the direct outcome of a public\'s determination of
its common good. A full analysis of how this works, or in some cases,
fails to work in practice is beyond the scope of this article. But it is
important to note that there is no argument here for the privileging of
one private individual\'s notion of what constitutions "real problem"
versus that of another. That is for the public to decide.

Human Woe and Issues That Matter

The final point to be made about reconstruction stems directly from the
previous discussion: some problems matter more than others with regard
to the alleviation of concrete human suffering. Which issues matter the
most in our world? Ultimately, per Dewey\'s political philosophy touched
on above, that is for the public to decide. Assuming that there ever
could be a "common good," we can hypothesize that [[people might
**choose** to **focus on**]{.mark} issues]{.underline} that affect them
daily, issues [such as **climate change**, **poverty**]{.underline},
health care, education, [**racism**, and **sexism**]{.underline}, as
well as **[[war]{.mark} and peace]{.underline}**, all [[issues that are
of]{.mark} **grave [importance]{.mark}** [to
**humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. IR, especially in its American form,
with its disproportionate emphasis on global security and great power
war, has given scant attention to too many other issues, and when
attention is given to the "lesser" topics, they are relegated to
sub-sub-specializations within the discipline, "Gender and IR," for
instance. More **[[problematic]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the
standpoint of pragmatism, [[the **approach**]{.mark}**-driven
wing**]{.underline} of the discipline [is **more [concerned]{.mark}**
[with which **paradigm** has scored]{.mark} **more [points]{.mark}** [in
the]{.mark} **epic [contest]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} **paradigmatic
[supremacy]{.mark}** [than with]{.mark}]{.underline} the matter of [[how
the world **could or should** respond]{.underline}]{.mark} to climate
change or why hundreds of million of children lack basic nutrition and
medical care. The interpretivist/linguistic wing, in contrast, is more
concerned with how texts are interpreted in graduate seminars than with
the fact that children in inner cities cannot even read a text at all.

53 [[Many]{.underline}]{.mark} IR scholars are still fighting over
whether and to what extent "unit-level variables" should be taken into
consideration in understanding international politics (and if so,
whether one might still rightly be accepted in the club of realism).54
Others [[are **trying** to demonstrate that IR]{.underline}]{.mark}
constructivism [[is]{.mark} really "**[liberalism]{.mark} in
disguise**]{.underline}."55 [[This is]{.underline}]{.mark} not a stab at
"why realism is (yet again) wrong." It is [a critique of the
**[self-]{.mark}definitionally [obsessed]{.mark}**, paradigm-driven
culture]{.underline} of academic IR. I would not go so far as to claim
that there are no scholars who study everyday politics; many clearly
do.56 Rather, [[the problem is that]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
incentive structure to contribute to the "big debates" of the
discipline, namely, those at [[the]{.mark} paradigmatic
level]{.underline}, is a [[project]{.mark} that [drifts]{.mark} **ever
[afar]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the problems of "**[concrete]{.mark} human
[woe]{.mark}**[" that affect the]{.mark} **other [millions of
people]{.mark}** [who happen not to]{.mark} have **graduate [degrees in

Roberts\'s analysis was not without flaws. He did not consider the
limits of British emancipation, either in terms of expectations for
continued black labor productivity or how it legitimized the British
imperial project writ large. Yet Roberts was among the first to
articulate the idea that black freedom cannot be premised upon
indigenous death and displacement. Inspired by Roberts, I begin with the
claim that [slavery and settler colonialism share deep and overlapping
histories]{.underline}. What insights might emerge from thinking of
[settler colonialism as a logic of indigenous erasure that has sustained
its coherence partly through the language of anti-blackness? Or from
considering anti-blackness as dependent upon militarized discourses of
security with roots in settler colonialism]{.underline}? Conversely,
what intellectual pathways are foreclosed when [slavery and settler
colonialism vie for primacy as the violence most foundational to the
modern social order]{.underline}? **[[Recent work in black
studies]{.mark}, on the one hand, [and]{.mark} indigenous and [settler
colonialism]{.mark} studies, on the other, has [made]{.mark} [claims to
exceptionalism that leave the two fields at an
impasse]{.mark}]{.underline}**. After surveying this work, I argue that
[[twentieth-century colonial projects]{.mark} have [relied upon both
anti-blackness and]{.mark} a logic of [settlement]{.mark}.]{.underline}
**[Social [movements]{.mark} [have been able to express radical]{.mark}
forms of [solidarity]{.mark} [by suspending claims to
exceptionalism]{.mark} so pervasive [in scholarly
analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I conclude with a brief sketch of
contemporary black-Palestinian solidarity activism, paying particular
attention to how the anti-blackness at work in the Israeli settler
project makes blackness resonate in Palestine and occupation resonate
among black Americans. Frameworks of Exceptionalism Indigenous and black
critical theory are extraordinarily robust fields. They have challenged
the notion that the United States could live up to its universalist
foundations ("liberty and justice for all") if only it could address the
structuring exclusions of race, gender, sexuality, and class. Rather
than framing such exclusions as the unfortunate effect of lingering
prejudices that could be remedied by inclusion within the fabric of the
nation-state, indigenous and black theory frame settler colonialism and
racial slavery, respectively, as the very conditions of possibility for
the United States. The violence of these processes is enduring and
ongoing, and the hinge of inclusion/exclusion both misnames that
violence and narrows any sense of possibility for how it can be
redressed. These fields have emerged in isolation from one another.
[Each has supplanted facile notions of racial exclusion, but in doing so
has proposed alternatives---colonialism and slavery---premised upon
exclusive claim to accounting for the violence of modernity.2 These
claims are internally coherent and broadly useful, but are incompatible.
[Either colonialism or slavery must be subordinated to the
other]{.mark}, [forcing them into aporetic tension]{.mark}. **[Each
field reduces the other to]{.mark} a variation on the theme of [liberal
multiculturalism]{.mark} in order [to]{.mark} [maintain]{.mark} the
[integrity]{.mark} [of its own exceptionalist
claims]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Yet **[[these theories cannot
fully]{.mark} [account]{.mark} for the historical messiness of [black
and indigenous encounters]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [one another]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} with [the]{.mark} US [state]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[**[What might emerge if scholars suspended]{.mark}---even
momentarily---such [claims]{.mark} in order [to consider the impasse of
settlement and slavery using historical methods]{.mark}?** Recent work
in black studies has argued for a [reconceptualized notion of black
racialization]{.mark} in which blackness emerges at the edge of
humanity---that is, the category "black" is defined against the category
"human." In such formulations, black/non-black is the primary division
of the modern social, epistemological, and ontological order,
exemplified by Atlantic slavery and its legacies]{.underline}. Although
this group of scholars has disagreed about whether slavery\'s
transformation of human life into a commodity was radically generative
or a shattering obliteration of the self, they are united by the idea
that our ways of knowing the modern world and imagining alternatives to
it require centering the violence of enslavement.3 [While this work is
incredibly helpful for understanding the epochal impact of slavery, it
[relegates]{.mark} [forms of racialization and colonialism]{.mark} [that
do not self-subordinate to slavery]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the realm of
[anti-blackness or liberal multiculturalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such
framing [has led Tiffany King to claim that **[black studies is
"inarticulate in the face of settler
colonialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}." 4 Put another way, the field of
[black studies has not fully reckoned with the historical intimacy
between colonialism and slavery.]{.underline} In his seminal work Empire
As a Way of Life, William Appleman Williams asserted that the imperial
life of the United States "is predicated upon a charming but ruthless
faith in infinite progress fueled by infinite growth." 5 The liberty so
central to the founding mythology of the United States was defined by
its limitlessness ---not in terms of whom it applied to, as in the
fantasies of liberalism, but in terms of its spatial expansion. To be
free was to face no limits to growth. Tepid versions of black studies
have made the assumption that the struggle for justice is an
inclusionary one, defined by access to rights and liberties guaranteed
by the language of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
This type of black studies has not reconciled with the fact that freedom
has never been purely abstract; it is always enacted over and against
the ongoing history of colonialism. Thus Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri
can claim, "between the presidencies of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew
Jackson, the open space of the frontier became the conceptual terrain of
republican democracy." 6 Such scholarship has refused to grapple with
what it means to diagnose oppression and demand its redress from within
a settler state. Even the more robust formation of [[black
studies]{.mark} concerned with the exceptionalism of slavery has not
reckoned with the relationship between this drive to growth and the
expansion of human chattel.7 It [has not reckoned with how black
racialization occurred in tandem with settler ideology and not merely
adjacent]{.mark} [to it]{.mark}]{.underline}. To be clear, this problem
is not one of black studies ignoring the presence of indigenous people,
but of how **[[the field theorizes black racialization in a way that
precludes]{.mark} a serious [engagement with indigenous
dispossession]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [If blackness is exclusion from
the category of the human or access to a knowable self, the loss of
sovereignty can only be framed as a lesser loss with a subordinate
grammar.]{.underline} For example, Jared Sexton has argued that slavery
"precedes and prepares the way for colonialism," and describes
colonialism as "the issue or heir of slavery, its outgrowth or edifice
or monument." 8 While this may be a generative theoretical claim that
lends conceptual coherence to [Sexton's insightful framing of slavery
and antiblackness, it is simply not historically accurate.]{.underline}

**Their exceptionalist reading of sovereignty misidentifies the
sovereign possibility of the Native -- *from the settler/master
perspective* the Native is void and there is no possibility of humanity
-- turns all Sexton args and is a solvency deficit to the alt.**

7.1 Being-outside-Settler-Time In his text Red, White & Black: Cinema
and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms, [Wilderson provides]{.underline}
us with [an ontological taxonomy of life under settler colonialism of
human-Savage-Slave]{.underline}57. Within his necessarily arboreal
theorization [[the white/settler/master occupies the space of the
'human']{.mark},]{.underline} alongside all other non-Native and
non-Black people of colour, while [[the]{.mark} [Black Slave is the
abjected non-human. Between these two positions is the Native Savage,
which for Wilderson occupies a liminal position of
half-humanness]{.mark}]{.underline} (2010). [The reasoning for the
half-human positionality of the Native Savage for Wilderson is found
within his understanding of the grammars of Native life: genocide and
the loss of sovereignty.]{.underline} Within his theorization of the
structure of U.S. antagonisms, [the former is unable to be made
legible]{.underline} within the rhetorical world of the human cum
settler, and rather finds articulation with the grammars of Black
suffering: accumulation and fungibility. [However,]{.underline} so
Wilderson theorizes, [the latter, which is [the loss of sovereignty, is
able to be reincorporated and made legible within the human's register
of structural re-adjustment]{.mark}]{.underline} (2010). Wilderson
notes: On the semantic field on which the new protocols are possible,
Indigenism can indeed become partially legible through a programmatics
of structural adjustment (as fits our globalized era). In other words,
for the Indians' subject position to be legible, their positive
registers of lost or threatened cultural identity must be foregrounded,
when in point of fact the antagonistic register of dispossession that
Indians "possess" is a position in relation to a socius structured by
genocide. ... \[T\]he Indigenous position is one for which genocide is a
constitutive element, not merely an historical event, without which
Indians would not, paradoxically, "exist" (2010:9-10). He continues this
line of thinking elsewhere, writing: whereas the genocidal modality of
the "Savage" grammar of suffering articulates itself quite well within
the two modalities of the Slave's grammar of suffering, accumulation and
fungibility, Native American film, political texts, and ontological
meditations fail to recognize, much less pursue this articulation. The
small corpus of socially engaged films directed by Native Americans
privilege the ensemble of questions animated by the imaginary of
sovereign loss (2010:28). As powerful and insightful as Wilderson's
ontological mapping of white/settler/master and Black life may be,
[there are certain theoretical miscues]{.underline} within his analysis
which cause him to misallocate the Native Savage as liminal to human
life, as not-quite-human, rather than fully outside of it. Indeed, in
later work, Wilderson completely abjures this formulation under the
influence of Jared Sexton's work in "The Vel of Slavery" (2016)58, and
places the formerly liminal Native Savage fully inside of the category
of the Man qua the human (2011). Focusing on his earlier and more
textually substantial work however, for Juárez---who's own work
repositions Wilderson's grammar of Redness from genocide and sovereignty
to clearing and civilization---this is because [[Wilderson:
compartmentalizes the Red ontological position of clearing into genocide
and (the loss of) sovereignty,]{.mark} ultimately [failing to recognize
the nature of Red life as]{.mark} the condition of [being cleared a
priori to existence]{.mark}]{.underline}, what Wilderson articulates as
the shift from clearing as a verb to clearing as a noun at the moment of
the "discovery" \[emphasis mine\] (2014). This essential element of
recognition for Juárez is the entry point of the Native as
out-of-settler-time. In drawing this development out of the settler
order of things, we turn to the Marshall Trilogy of decisions at the
U.S. supreme court in the early-to-mid-19th century, seminal decisions
in the juridical reckoning of the Native within the northern bloc.
Johnson v. McIntosh, Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, and Worcester v.
Georgia were three of the single most important decisions of the U.S.
Supreme Court with regards to Native Law and Indigenous rights, setting
forth the legal terrain upon which much the proceeding governance of
settler colonialism would be built. For example, the Court's unanimous
decision in 1823 in the Johnson case, despite no actual representation
for Indigenous peoples, re-inscribed into the law of the new, secular
american republic the older, christian european "doctrine of discovery",
which decidedly relegated Indigenous peoples to secondary status on the
question of their possession of their own land, which was transferred
into the realm of being squabbles over territory by competing european
and settler actors. Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, and Worcester v. Georgia
continued this legal colonialism, refining the process over the period
of these two subsequent Supreme Court cases (Williams 2005). Lumbee
critical legal scholar Robert A. Williams, Jr. says of their
foundational role in the settler order of things that: the Marshall
Model of Indian Rights plays much the same kind of inaugural and
paradoxical organizing role in the Supreme Court's Indian law as
Bhabha's wondrous "English book" plays in the cultural writings of
English colonialism (2005:50). In particular, these three court
decisions have had a profound and lasting implication for any
understanding of Native sovereignty and the loss thereof. In this
regard, Juárez notes, "The Marshall rulings ontologically determine
Redness from the moment the Settler meets the Savage (2014). The
temporal dimension of the Marshal rulings is likewise noted by Wolfe,
who states: [[Native sovereignty existed out of]{.underline}]{.mark} (or
at least, prior to) [[colonial time]{.mark}, which is to say, it did not
exist at all]{.underline}---or rather, [[it only existed in order to be
diminished. Paradoxically]{.underline}]{.mark}, therefore, [[Native
sovereignty was a creation of discovery]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Propositionally, it was an imperative generated by Marshall's commitment
to diminution, which required an undiminished prior state that could be
diminished from (2012:10-11). Finally, Mark Rifkin describes the
cognition of Native sovereignty in light of the Marshall Decisions as a
"peculiar status." In particular, he says of the place of [Native
sovereignty within the juridical worlding of the settler]{.underline}
that it [is "less as a way of designating a specific set of powers than
as a negative presence, as what Native peoples categorically
lack"]{.underline} (2017b:297). [[The notion of Native sovereignty is a
void]{.mark}, a nullity, a simulacrum par excellence; it does not hide
some genuine truth, some deeper reality, that Natives are, or
were]{.underline}, in fact, [sovereign self-subjects and that this
status was lost within the cognition of the
white/settler/master]{.underline}. As Baudrillard himself notes, in a
simulated reference to the new testament, "The simulacrum is never what
hides the truth---it is truth that hides the fact that there is none"
(1994:1). This is, as Juárez articulates, the essence of "being cleared
a priori to existence" (2014). On the ontological implications of this,
and of the resultant construction of the Native within the symbolic
order of the settler, he notes: [For the concept that the United States
had eminent domain over the land to gain coherence it must presume, in
the a priori, that the terra nullius of the Americas always was. Here,
[Native Americans emerge barred from sovereignty at the ontological
level, and thus can only be regarded as non-human
occupants]{.mark}.]{.underline} This a priori clearing becomes the
necessary grounding for the Marshall ruling to make sense because the
clearing of land must be scaled to the level of a hemisphere in order
for colonial land-grabbing to even begin to play out within the
Americas. ... [[as far as the Settler is concerned]{.underline}]{.mark},
as far as the world is concerned, [[the Red Indian never had
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}, never had any claim to the land at all
(2014). The above discussions of the Marshall Rulings in the United
States also reveal an additional problem with Wilderson's theorization
of the Native as a kind of liminal half-human or not-quite-human. This
is that while he sees the loss of sovereignty for the Native as a point
of articulation with the grammars of suffering of the human, what he
fundamentally misses is that where the same linguistic taxons may be
used to seemingly describe a notion of Native sovereignty that is
superficially similar to the sovereignty of the white/settler/master, it
is, in fact, something of a categorically, and fundamentally different,
and inferior, kind. While not in my reading a direct critique of
Wilderson, Wolfe makes this distinction clear, noting: In keeping with
the doctrine of discovery, the Marshall judgments presuppose, and can
only consistently be read as presupposing, a fundamental asymmetry
between Indians' right of occupancy and the property rights that white
settlers could obtain once Native title had been extinguished. Under
certain conditions, Natives' immemorial occupation of their land
entitled them to a right of soil or usufruct, which was understood as
hunting and gathering rather than as agriculture. This right was
inalienable. It could not be sold to private individual or corporation
but, under the principle of pre-emption, could only be surrendered to
the crown. Once Native title had been surrendered to the crown and
extinguished, however, the crown could transfer to settlers an
entitlement (fee simple) that was greater than the right of occupancy
that the Natives had surrendered. Thus the process yielded more than
land for settlers. It also yielded sovereign subjecthood: they became
the sort of people who could own rather than merely occupy. The
asymmetry between occupancy and title reflected a thoroughgoing
discrepancy whereby Indian and white were categories of a different
order (2012:10). [Thus, [the trap for which Wilderson falls in his
discussion of (the loss of) Native sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline} as
one of the two modalities of Red suffering, and as a point of
articulation with the alienation and exploitation of the
white/settler/master, [is one of language. As he claims]{.underline} in
Red, White & Black: At every sale---the soul, the body, the group, the
land, and the universe---they \[the settler and the Indian\] can both
practice cartography, and although at every scale their maps are
radically incompatible, [[their respective "mapness" is never in
question.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[This capacity for cartographic coherence is the thing
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}, that which secures subjectivity for both
the Settler and the 'Savage' and articulates them to one another in a
network of connections, transfers and displacements' (2010:181).
Wilderson's predicament is made clearer in his more recent essay
"Afro-Pessimism and the End of Redemption," in which he creates a
juxtaposition between Simon Ortiz's poem "Sand Creek" (2000) alongside
his own, "Law Abiding" (2013). Through his reading of Ortiz's poetic
work he claims: \[T\]he relational status of both the Indian victims and
the White oppressors is established---a reciprocal dynamic is
acknowledged (between degraded humanity, Indians, and exalted humanity,
White settlers). This reciprocal dynamic is based on the fact that even
though one group is massacring the other, both exist within the same
paradigm of recognition and incorporation. Their relation is based on a
mutual recognition of sovereignty. At every scale of abstraction, body,
family, community, cosmology, physical terrain, Native American
sovereignty is recognized and incorporated into the consciousness of
both Indians and settlers who destroyed them. The poem's coherence is
sustained by structural capacity for reciprocity between the genociders
and the genocided (2016). Speculatively: Wilderson's trap of language
here and elsewhere is perhaps as a result of the insufficiencies in, and
inherent ideological and affective working of, settler juridical and
philosophical linguistic taxonomies59. In essence [he mistakes the
outward linguistic conceptual coverings of these two concepts of
supposed sovereignty for their actual ontological content]{.underline};
two things which in fact could not be more distinct---thus allowing for
his argument that Natives and the white/settler/master share a mutual
cognition of the sovereignty of the other, united in a joint paradigm of
"recognition and incorporation." As Wolfe notes, however, "The same
words meant different things when applied to either" (2012:10). Tracing
a similar path Joanne Barker likewise notes that: There is no fixed
meaning for what sovereignty is---what it means by definition, what it
implies in public debate, or how it has been conceptualized in
international, national, or indigenous law. Sovereignty---and its
related histories, perspectives, and identities---is embedded within the
specific social relations in which it is invoked and given meaning. ...
The challenge, then, to understand how and for whom sovereignty matters
is to understand the historical circumstances under which it is given
meaning. There is nothing inherent about its significance (2005:21). We
can follow the old structural linguistics of Saussure (2013) through
Baudrillard (2019; 2006; 1994) and Derrida (2016) that [any sign within
a given assemblage gains its meaningful content in their relationships
to other signs and other concepts; through what it is not. [Native
sovereignty is not, and never has been the same thing as the sovereignty
of the white/settler/master]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is born out
explicitly within the juridical judgements of the Marshall Trilogy and
the legal rendition of prior Native possession as mere usufruct, rather
than the fulsomeness of free-holding private property---true
sovereignty---something which, via a technology of settler governance
that appears more as a form of the alchemy, it could be transformed into
and granted forthwith to genuine human (ethnoclass (bourgeois) Man)
subjects through of the sovereign power of the Crown or the Republic.
Wilderson is hardly alone in this movement, however, which seeks, as
Wolfe notes, "to minimize Indian difference and assimilate it to
Whiteness" (2016a:8), or more specifically, to assimilate it to Man in
its overrepresentation as the human, and thus make it inimical to all
other forms of life and decolonial, abolitionist and liberation
struggles. For Wilderson's close fellow traveller Jared Sexton this is
most explicit (2016), as it is in the work of Migration and
Transnationalism scholar Nandita Sharma (2008-09; 2015). Thus, for them,
as Melanie K. Yazzie and Nick Estes describe, moves towards a critique
of settler colonialism as a distinct modality of domination and towards
a decolonial Nativeness are, "in their recent assaults on Native
sovereignty and nationhood, racist to the point of treachery against all
oppressed people" (2016:20). What is certainly the case here is that, as
critical as their thought may be with regards to the struggles of
racialized and colonized peoples, all three of these theorists, within
the bodies of their work, effectively re-inscribe and recapitulate a
settler-colonial order of things. As Wolfe puts it, speaking
specifically of Sharma, but easily applicable to all, colonial
resonances pervade their work (2013b:266). Quite on the contrary to this
kind of world-building, counterpoised as they are to white supremacy,
rather than form a point of legibility and articulation between the
human and the Savage, as Wilderson argues (2010), Native sovereignty and
the sovereignty of the white/settler/master ultimately occupy
fundamentally different and incommensurable registers, on planes of
linguistics, the political and the ontological. This in and of itself
upsets much of Wilderson's theorization that sovereignty its loss places
the Native in the liminal state of half-humanness---or his later moves
to simply fully assimilate the Native into the human---without necessary
recourse to Juárez's shift of the grammars of Native suffering from
genocide and (the loss of) sovereignty to clearing and civilization,
though I do prefer his general outline for the depth it pursues. In
short, the void and the fulsome are neither coeval nor coterminous and
can never be. And this is the ultimate trap that Wilderson and similar
theorists face when they find themselves confronted by the personage and
the position of the Native Savage and mistake superficial linguistic
outer-trappings for the inner ontological and political content of the
sign. As Juárez eloquently, if painfully, states: The pain and anger
over a loss without name is the formation of the social group, it
transforms all narratives into narratives of surviving, every act of
"culture" by Native Americans becomes a survival strategy in which the
dualism between the overwhelming violence of being a Being of
nothingness and the deathly comfort of alcoholism and drug use is put
off. [Wilderson's concern with the irreconcilable "worlds" of the
Settler and the Savage is far too reductionist in the intricacy of the
violence inflicted against Red bodies. It is not that there is a Savage
world that stands in irreconcilable opposition to the world of the
Settler, but rather that Red life]{.underline} (as far as it can be
called life) [is a survival strategy that no longer possesses the
potential for world creation]{.underline}. ... He ignores that the
violence Red bodies face extends far beyond the reservation into time
and space because it is a violence that silenced languages, burned
books, obliterated people, erased history, and shattered families
(2014). In this project of worlding, of world creation by the
white/settler/master as Man as its overrepresentation as the human,
there can be no reckoning, no casting of a decolonial face into the
future anterior, where there is present something that we might
recognize as a genuine Native sovereignty so long as the world of the
settler persists. [[Any futurity which preserves settler colonialism
with its civil society, governmental, ontological, and symbolic orders
is one that by its very constitution voids any notion of Native
self-determination]{.mark}, not only from the present but from the past
and the future as well, as anything other than pure
simulacra.]{.underline} Returning to the results of the Marshall
Decisions60, what they mean for any ontology of Nativeness are profound.
On the question of temporality, they must be taken as key to my
understanding, because they not only evacuate any possibility of Native
sovereignty from the spatial coordinates of the northern bloc of settler
colonialism, but indeed from all possible coordinates of temporal
cartography as well. [Native sovereignty is not just a sovereignty that
was lost]{.underline}, in that it is no longer part of the present-now
[but is, in fact, a sovereignty that never was. While]{.underline} the
Native---or, more correctly, [the myriad of diverse Indigenous
nations]{.underline} that would come to be confined within the legal
category of the Native through the governance techniques of settler
coloniality---[may have been self-governing and self-determining prior
to]{.underline} the [arrival]{.underline} on these shores of the
european, within the worlding of the euro-american/euro-canadian settler
[[the Native qua the Native is not, and never has been,
sovereign]{.mark}.]{.underline} The extent to which we can even begin to
discuss Native sovereignty and the Native as containing a cogent meaning
under the rubrics of settler governmentality, [[we must first recognize
that they have been, and always have been, determined by and through the
prerogative of the settler]{.mark}. [There is no possibility of
structural re-adjustment; only a relationship of aporia and
antagonism]{.mark}.]{.underline} This brings into sharp relief Byrd's
two-headed questioning of "do Indians live the ordinary life in the
contemporary now?" and "are Indians part of the present tense?"
(2011:37). In short, for me, the answer is a resounding no. For Byrd
herself, in her reading of Alexis de Tocqueville and the removal of the
Choctaw from their traditional homelands in the southeastern United
States, she notes that "Even in the present of their removal, the
Choctaws are always already past perfect: they had left, they had
stepped, they had been promised" (2011:37). Beyond questions of pure
legality, as in the questions of sovereignty in the Marshall Trilogy,
these issues of temporal abjection for the Native are significant. Mark
Rifkin in his work Beyond Settler Time: Temporal Sovereignty and
Indigenous Self-Determination asks, "What does it mean to be recognized
as existing in time?" before going on to note that: The representation
of Native peoples as either having disappeared or being remnants on the
verge of vanishing constitutes one of the principal means of effacing
Indigenous sovereignties. Such a portrayal of Indigenous temporal stasis
or absence erases extant forms of occupancy, governance, and opposition
to settler encroachments. Moreover, it generates a prism through which
any evidence of such survival will be interpreted as either vestigial
(and thus on the way to imminent extinction) or hopelessly contaminated
(as having lost---or quickly losing---the qualities understood as
defining something, someone, or some space as properly "Indian" in the
first place) (2017a:5). [In the worlding of the white/settler/master,
the Native is always, and has always been, "was" and]{.underline}
"were," [never "is"]{.underline} and "are." Certainly, if we take this
line of logic through its terminal point, not only is the Native
was/were and not is/are, [[the Native can indeed never truly be, so long
as the world of the settler continues to be]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
is precisely why Byrd, building upon Judith Butler's articulation of
when life is grievable (2016), asks whether the Native is able to cast a
life into the tense of the future anterior "in which Indians will have
been decolonized" (2011:38). The Native is a being-out-of-time if ever
there was one.61

[According to Sexton]{.underline}, no other oppression is reducible to
antiblackness, but the relative totality of antiblackness is the
privileged perspective from which to understand racial formation more
broadly. But unlike the way feminist and queer critical theory
interrogate heteropatriarchy from a subjectless standpoint, Sexton's
entire point seems to rest on the very specificity and
singularity---rather than subjectlessness---of black critical theory's
capacity to understand race. The privilege of this embodied viewpoint
similarly relies on rigidly binaristic conceptions of land and bodily
integrity. He writes, "If the indigenous relation to land precedes and
exceeds any regime of property, then the slave's inhabitation of the
earth precedes and exceeds any prior relation to land---landlessness.
And selflessness is the correlate. No ground for identity, no ground to
stand (on)."57 In other words, [the slave's nonrelation to her body
precedes and exceeds any other body's relation to land. However, [the

**as [terra nullius]{.mark}**]{.underline}---as legally empty
lands---[**[denies]{.mark} the very [corporeality]{.mark} of Indigenous
populations [to inhabit land]{.mark}**, much less have any rights to it.
Alongside genocidal elimination, [the erasure of Indigenous corporeal
existence is **inseparable from the ground it doesn't stand**
]{.mark}**on, or is removed from**. For the same reason that the
economic reductionism of orthodox Marxism has been discredited, [such an
argument that frames racial slavery as a base for a colonial
superstructure]{.mark} similarly **[fails to take into account the
dialectics of settler colonial capitalism]{.mark}**. The political
economy of [settler colonial capitalism is]{.mark} more appropriately
figured as [an **ecology of power relations than a linear chain of
events**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Relinquishing any conceptual privilege
that might be attributed to Indigeneity, alternatively, Coulthard offers
a useful anti-exceptionalist stance: "[[the colonial relation
should]{.mark} not [be understood]{.mark} as a primary locus of 'base'
from which these other forms of oppression flow, but **rather [as
the]{.mark} inherited background [field within which market, racist,
patriarchal, and state relations converge]{.mark}.**"58 From this view,
**[race and colonialism form the matrix of the settler colonial racial
state]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Putting colonial land and enslaved labor
at the center of a dialectical analysis, we can see that blackness is
neither reducible to Indigenous land nor Indigeneity to enslaved labor.
Indigenous peoples and slaves are not reducible to each other because
settler colonialism abides by a dual logic that is originally driven to
eliminate Native peoples from land and mix the land with enslaved black
labor. If land is the basis of settler colonialists' relationship to
Indigenous peoples, it is labor that frames that relationship with
enslaved peoples. We can draw on Patrick Wolfe's important points about
the heterogeneous racial effects of such a settler formation based on
Indigenous land and enslaved labor. To summarize those points, [[the
*racial* content of Indigenous peoples is the **mirror opposite of
blackness**]{.mark}. From the beginning, [a]{.mark}n eliminatory
[project was driven to reduce Native populations]{.mark} through
genocidal wars and later through statistical elimination through blood
quantum and assimilationist policies. [For slaves, an opposite
logic]{.mark} of exclusion [was driven to *increase*]{.mark}, not
eliminate, [the population]{.mark} of slaves**. [One logic does not
cause the other]{.mark}; rather, [they work together to serve a unitary
end]{.mark} in increasing white settler property in the form of land and
an enslaved labor force**. As a result, in the postemancipation,
postfrontier era, the **racial content of Indigenous peoples is entirely
dissolvable and eradicable**. Alternatively, the racial content of
blackness remains absolute and essential, and **maintains an infinite
capacity to contaminate**]{.underline}. As Wolfe states, "[the
respective [racializations . . . were]{.mark} **diametrically [opposed,
in a manner that reflected]{.mark} and preserved [the]{.mark}
foundational [distinction between land and labor]{.mark}.** For whereas
race for black people became an indelible trait that would survive any
amount of admixture, **race for Indians became an inherently descending
quantity that was terminally susceptible to dilution**]{.underline}."59
One consequence is that the phrase "separate but equal" can take two
meanings: as either an injurious legal relic or a sovereign politics of
the future.60 [[Given this]{.mark} stark [**distinction in racial
ontologies**, any critical theory that views race and colonialism as a
causal]{.mark} rather than dialectical relation [is **incapable of
exposing**]{.mark} **these inextricable logics of [settler
colonialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Thus the self-same/other distinction is necessary for the possibility of
identity itself. [There always has to exist an outside]{.underline},
which is also inside, [to the extent it is designated as the
impossibility from which the possibility of the existence of the subject
derives its rule]{.underline} (Badiou 2009, 220). [But although the
excluded place which isn't excluded insofar as it is necessary for the
very possibility of inclusion and identity may be universal]{.underline}
(may be considered "ontological"), [its content (what fills it) -- as
well as the mode of this filling and its reproduction]{.underline} --
[are contingent]{.underline}. In other words, the meaning of [the
signifier of exclusion is **not determined** once and for
all:]{.underline} the place of [the place of exclusion, of death is
itself over-determined, i.e. the very framework for deciding the other
and the same, [exclusion and inclusion, is **nowhere engraved in
ontological stone** but is political and never]{.mark} terminally
[settled.]{.mark}]{.underline} Put differently, [the "curvature of
intersubjective space"]{.underline} (Critchley 2007, 61) and thus,
[the]{.underline} specific [[modes of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
"othering" of [["otherness"]{.underline} [are nowhere decided in advance
(as]{.underline} ]{.mark}[a certain]{.underline} [[ontological
fatalism]{.mark} might have it]{.underline}) ([see
**Wilderson**]{.underline} 2008). **[[The social does not have to be
divided into white and black]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [the meaning of
these signifiers is never necessary]{.underline} -- [because [they are
signifiers]{.mark}.]{.underline} To be sure, [[colonialism]{.mark}
institutes an ontological [division]{.mark}]{.underline}, in that whites
exist in a way barred to blacks -- who are not. [But]{.underline} [this
ontological relation [is]{.mark} really on the side of the
**[ontic]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- that is, of [all [contingently
constructed identities]{.mark}, rather than the ontology of the social
which refers to the ultimate unfixity, the indeterminacy or lack of the
social.]{.underline} In this sense, then, the white man doesn't exist,
the black man doesn't exist (Fanon 1968, 165); and neither does the
colonial symbolic itself, including its most intimate structuring
relations -- [division is constitutive of the social, not the colonial
division. "Whiteness" may]{.underline} [well be very deeply sediment in
modernity]{.underline} itself, but respect for the "ontological
difference" (see Heidegger 1962, 26; Watts 2011, 279) shows up its
ontological status as ontic. [It may be so deeply sedimented that it
becomes difficult even to identify the very possibility of the
separation of whiteness from]{.underline} the very possibility of
[order, but from this it does not follow that the "void" of "black
being" functions as the ultimate substance]{.underline}, the
[transcendental signified **on which all possible forms of
sociality**]{.underline} are said to [**rest**.]{.underline} [[What gets
lost]{.underline}]{.mark} here, then, [[is]{.mark} the
**[specificity]{.mark}** of colonialism]{.underline}, of its
constitutive axis, [its "[ontological"
differential.]{.mark}]{.underline} A crucial feature of the colonial
symbolic is that the real is not screened off by the imaginary in the
way it is under capitalism. At the place of the colonised, [the symbolic
and the imaginary give way because [non-identity]{.mark}]{.underline}
(the real of the social) [[is]{.mark} immediately [inscribed in]{.mark}
the ["lived experience"]{.mark}]{.underline} (vécu) [of the colonised
subject]{.underline}. The colonised is "traversing the fantasy" (Zizek
2006a, 40--60) all the time; the void of the verb "to be" is the very
content of his interpellation. [The colonised is]{.underline}, in other
words, [the subject of anxiety for whom the symbolic and the imaginary
never work]{.underline}, who is left stranded by his very
interpellation.4 "[Fixed" into "non-fixity," he is eternally suspended
between "element" and "moment"]{.underline}5 -- he is [where the
colonial symbolic falters in the production of meaning and is thus the
point of entry of the real into the texture itself of
colonialism]{.underline}. Be this as it may, [[whiteness and blackness
are]{.underline} ([sustained by]{.underline}]{.mark}) [determinate and
**[contingent practices]{.mark}** of signification; the "structuring
relation"]{.underline} of colonialism thus itself [comprises a knot of
significations [which]{.mark}, no matter how tight, [can always be
undone.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[Anti-colonial]{.underline}** -- i.e.,
[[anti-"white"]{.underline} --]{.mark} [modes of
[struggle]{.mark}]{.underline} are not (just) "psychic" 6 but
[[involve]{.mark} the "**[reactivation]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (or
"de-sedimentation")7 [**[of colonial objectivity]{.mark}**
itself]{.underline}. No matter how sedimented (or global), colonial
objectivity is not ontologically immune to antagonism. Differentiality,
as Zizek insists (see Zizek 2012, chapter 11, 771 n48), immanently
entails antagonism in that differentiality both makes possible the
existence of any identity whatsoever and at the same time -- because it
is the presence of one object in another -- undermines any identity ever
being (fully) itself. Each element in a differential relation is the
condition of possibility and the condition of impossibility of each
other. It is this dimension of antagonism that the Master Signifier
covers over transforming its outside (Other) into an element of itself,
reducing it to a condition of its possibility.8 All [symbolisation
produces an ineradicable excess over itself, something it can't totalise
or make sense of,]{.underline} where its production of meaning falters.
[This is]{.underline} its internal limit point, [its real]{.underline}:9
an errant "object" [that has no place of its own, isn't recognised in
the categories of the system but is produced by it -- its "part of no
part" or "object small a."]{.underline}10 Correlative to this object "a"
is the subject "stricto sensu" -- i.e., as the empty subject of the
signifier without an identity that pins it down.11 [That is the subject
of antagonism in confrontation with the real of the social, as distinct
from "subject" position based on a determinate identity]{.underline}.

[What is often overlooked in blackness is bound up with what has often
been over- seen]{.underline}. Certain experiences of being tracked,
managed, cornered in seemingly open space are inextricably bound to an
aesthetically and politically dangerous supplementarity, an internal
exteriority waiting to get out, as if the prodigal\'s return were to
leaving itself[. [Black studies' concern]{.mark} [with]{.mark} what it
is to own [one\`s dispossession,]{.mark} to mine what is held in having
been possessed, [makes it]{.mark} more [possible to embrace]{.mark} the
[underprivilege]{.mark} of being sentenced to the gift of constant
escape]{.underline}. [[The strain of black studies that strains against
this interplay of itinerancy and identity]{.underline}]{.mark} - whether
in the interest of putting down roots or dis- claiming them [- could be
said, [also]{.mark}, to [constitute a departure,]{.mark} though it may
well be [into]{.mark} a [stasis]{.mark} more severe than the one such
work imagines]{.underline} (itself to be leaving). [[In
contradistinction to such skepticism, one might]{.underline}]{.mark}
plan, like Curtis Mayfield, to stay a believer and therefore to
[[avow]{.mark} what might be called a kind of metacritical optimism.
Such optimism, **[black optimism]{.mark}**, is bound up with what it is
to claim blackness and the appositional,]{.underline} run- away,
phonoptic [black operations-expressive of an autopoetic organization in
which flight and inhabitation modify each other-that have been thrust
upon it. The burden of this paradoxically aleatory goal is our
historicity, animating the reality of escape in and the possibility of
escape from.]{.underline} What if the study of comparative racialization
begins to extend and deepen its critical and imaginative relation to the
terms abolition and reconstruction in a genuine, fundamental, fantastic,
radical collective rethinking of them that will take into account their
historical ground while also propelling them with the greatest possible
centrifugal force into other, outer, space? Then, even though these
terms index a specific history in the United States, their continued
relevance and resonance will be international as well as intranational
insofar as the ongoing aggressive constitution of the modern
nation-state as a carceral entity extends histories of forced migration
and stolen labor and insofar as the imperial suppression of movements
that would excavate new aesthetic, political, and economic
dispositions\--as well, of course, as those movements themselves- is a
global phenomenon. Abolition and reconstruction might then be seen as
ongoing projects animating the study of comparative racialization as
well as black studies, two fields that will be seen as each other's
inner- most ends, two helds that will be understood as constituted
through the claim they make on-their thinking of and in-blackness.
Finally, [one might plan to continue to believe that there is such a
thing as black- ness and that blackness has an essence given
in]{.underline} striated, ensemblic, [authentic experience]{.underline}
([however]{.underline} much a certain natural bend is amplified by the
force of every kind of event, however productive such constant
inconstancy of shape and form must be of new understandings of essence
and experience). It is obvious (particularly after the recent lessons of
Lindon Barrett, Herman Bennett, Daphne Brooks, Nahum Chandler, Denise
Ferreira da Silva, Brent Edwards, Saidiya Hartman, Sharon Holland, and
Achilles Mbembe, among others) that [[blackness has always emerged
as]{.mark} nothing other than [the richest possible combination of
dispersion and permeability]{.mark} in and as the mass improvisation and
protection of the very idea of the human. Thus, concern over
[the]{.mark} supposedly stultifying [force of authenticity exerted
by]{.mark} supposedly restrictive and [narrow conceptions of
blackness]{.mark}]{.underline}, or worry over the supposed intranational
dominance of blackness broadly and unrigorously conceived (in ways that
presuppose its strict biological limitation within an unlimited
minoritarian field), or anxiety over the putatively intradiasporic
hegemony of a certain mode of blackness (which presumes national as well
as biological determinations that are continually over- and
underdetermined) [[indexes some other trouble,]{.mark} which we would do
well to investigate. Such investigation is best accompanied by vigilant
remembrance of and commitment to the fact that [blackness is
present]{.mark}]{.underline} (as E. P. Thompson said of the English
working class) [[at its own making]{.mark} and that all the people who
are called black are given in and to that presence,]{.underline} which
exceeds them (in an irrevocable, antenational combination of terror and
enjoyment, longing and rejection, that Hartman, in particular,
illuminates). Ultimately, [the paraontological force that is transmitted
in the long chain of life and death performances that are the concern of
[black studies is horribly misunderstood if it is understood as
exclusive]{.mark}. Everyone whom blackness claims, which is to say
everyone, can claim blackness.]{.underline} That claim is neither the
first nor the last anticipatory reorientation but is, rather, an
irreducible element of the differentially repeating plane that
intersects and animates the comparativist sphere. In this regard, black
studies might best be described as a location habitually lost and found
within a moving tendency where one looks back and forth and wonders how
utopia came to be submerged in the interstices and on the outskirts of
the fierce and urgent now. The temporal paradox of
[optimism]{.underline}-that it is, on the one hand, a necessarily
futurial attitude while being, on the other hand, in its proper
Leibnizian formulation, an assertion of the necessity, rightness, and
timelessness of the always already existing-resonates in the slim gap
between analytic immersion and deictic reserve. This bitter earth [is
the best of all possible worlds, a fact that necessitates the renewed,
reconstructed, realization of imaginative intensities that move through
the opposition of voluntary secrecy and forced exposure in order to
understand how the underground operates out in, and as, the
open]{.underline}. What\'s the relation between the limit and the open?
Between blackness and the limit? Between a specific and materially
redoubled finitude called blackness and the open? The new critical
discourse on the relation between blackness and death has begun to
approach these questions. That discourse reveals that [[optimism doesn't
require]{.underline}]{.mark}-indeed, it cannot persist within-[the
[repression of that relation; rather, it always lives (which is to say,
escapes) in the]{.mark} faithful, postfatal assertion of a [right to
refuse]{.mark}, in]{.underline} the prenatal instantiation of [a
collective negative tendency to differ, [and in the resistance to the
regulative powers that]{.mark} resistance, differing, and [refusal call
into being]{.mark}]{.underline}. The general insistence that we don\'t
mind leaving here is inseparable from the fact that it\'s all right.
Black optimism persists in thinking that we have what we need, that we
can get there from here, that there's nothing wrong with us or even, in
this regard, with here, even as it also bears an obsession with why it
is that difference calls the same, that resistance calls regulative
power, into existence, thereby se- curing the simultaneously vicious and
vacant enmity that characterizes here and now, forming and deforming us.
[However much trouble stays in mind]{.underline} and, therefore, in the
light of a certain interest that the ones who are without interests have
in making as much trouble as possible[, there is cause for optimism as
long as there is a need for optimism]{.underline}. Cause and need
converge in the bent school or marginal church in which we gather
together to be in the name of being otherwise.

In this chapter, I explore the possibility of decolonizing sight.
[Decolonizing sight requires that we understand what directs our sight.
It also means that we interrogate a social world ordered by conquest.
What kinds of inner eyes direct the way that we view bodies and space in
settler societies?6 How have the ways that we have been taught to
survive, self actualize and know ourselves]{.underline} in settler
societies shaped the ways that we look, see and know? In this chapter,
[I focus on the visual orders and optic regimes of settler colonialism
as sites of knowledge creation and power that skew our vision. In this
chapter, [we will be developing new ways of looking at old
landscapes]{.mark}. I draw upon the creative work of Julie Dash and
Catherine McKinley, and the scholarly writing of Sylvia [Wynter]{.mark},
Jennifer Morgan, Saidiya [Hartman]{.mark}, Hortense Spillers, Frank
[Wilderson]{.mark} and Oyeronke Oyewumi in order to challenge the visual
and cognitive regimes of the settler colonial order]{.underline}. [These
cultural producers and theorists [help us apprehend]{.mark},
[conceptualize]{.mark}, and [develop inner eyes]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
help us [visualize]{.mark} the [ways that Blackness]{.mark} and slavery
[shape the settler colonial landscape]{.mark}. They [help]{.mark} us
[bring]{.mark} the [plantation and]{.mark} [the body of the
slave]{.mark} back [into]{.mark} [settler colonialism's analytic
frames.]{.mark} **These [new units of analysis]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
conceptual [tools]{.mark} can help [change]{.mark} [our inner
eyes]{.mark} [so]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} [can see how settler
colonialism]{.mark} [and slavery structure one another]{.mark}. [They
make simultaneous vision possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.7 Simultaneous
vision is difficult to obtain. [It requires that we retrain our thought,
inner eyes and eyes to adjust their focus in order to attend to the
ephemeral and moving traces of power that at times recede or disappear
into the background or a realm of the seemingly invisible depending on
the landscape]{.underline}. The power of [[settler colonialism]{.mark}'s
[and slavery]{.mark}'s spatial and ontological formations [does not
appear]{.mark} on the landscape [with equal intensity]{.mark}, in the
[same hue]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} [equally positioned]{.mark} on the
landscape]{.underline}. **[At times the productive and repressive power
that makes the slave will be the foreground color and the power of
settler colonialism will provide a bit of texture.]{.underline}** The
texture in the background is just as crucial as the foreground color. My
reorganization of these units of analysis is what is new. Scholars of
slavery and settler colonialism have inherited analytic units like the
plantation, the homestead/settlement, the Master, the Settler, the Slave
which often work to sequester Native Studies, Black Studies, settler
colonial studies and scholarship on slavery. [[I want to reframe]{.mark}
some of the [key analytics]{.mark} from each of these fields of study
[by looking at them simultaneously]{.mark}.]{.underline} However,
**[[what happens when we think about]{.mark} the [plantation]{.mark} [as
a result of settler colonial]{.mark} spatial [patterns]{.mark}? [What is
possible]{.mark} [when we ask, how]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [Native
subjectivity]{.mark} [and space obliterated by the plantation]{.mark}?
What is possible when ask, [how]{.mark} [is]{.mark} the [slave master

them [as co-constituting one another]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

We must consider that [[Settler colonialism shapes and constitutes Black

afterlife in America.]{.underline}** [While slavery and anti-Black
racism should be active and robust analytic frames]{.underline} that
guide Black Studies and help us understand Black subjectivity in the
Western Hemisphere, [settler colonialism also structures Black life.
[The genocide of Native peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the perpetual

that live in the US and Settler colonial nations]{.underline}.30 Though
it touches and shapes everyone's life it does so in very different ways.

[also shapes and structures antiBlack racism. The ontological positions

ultimately argues that **[[slavery and anti-Black racism are not

[processes that create Blackness in]{.mark} all of [its embodied

abject, fungible and situated at the outer limits of

Redefining Settlement: Settlement within the disciplines of colonial
history, US history, Native Studies and the emerging field of settler
colonial studies is often defined through the space and time of contact.
The first moments of European contact with the lands of the New World
and the Native people of the hemisphere give us our spatial and temporal
frame for the origins of settlement.10 Dash's reorganization of the
Eliza Lucas Pinckney archive allows us to reorganize the spatial and
temporal frames of settlement. For Dash, settlement is reorganized along
similar coordinates as Sylvia Wynter's frame for conquest. In her novel,
Dash takes us back to West Africa to give us some context and explains
how the cultivation of indigo that would become a part of the process of
settling the land in the British colonies is a protracted process that
in fact starts before arrival on these shores. In the novel, Dash takes
us to West Africa and introduces us to Ayodele (Elizabeth Peazant) when
she is a twelve year old girl. Twelfth year come, Ayodele in the indigo
fields with mama, learning all she able bout growing indigo and making
it into paste to be sent to de market. It was a long an difficult
process, but she patient, an after her first successful batch, they call
her 'My Indigo Girl' as her mother did.11 The expertise that Ayodele
gains as a child makes her valuable to Arab and European slave
traders.12 Eventually Ayodele is then sold to the "Pinchney"13 family
and is forced to tame the soil and plant in order to cultivate indigo in
Charleston on the Wappoo plantation. Nobody know how, but some way the
mistress found out that Ayodele knew how to grow indigo. Maybe she see
this piece of cloth that Ayodele bring with her colored with indigo. So
mistress gave her some seedlings an a small piece of land to work. The
mistress told the Boss Man that Ayodele was only to work that bit of
land. Oooh, he not like that one bit, but her would not hear nothing
else. Well, Ayodele did all right, an the mistress very pleased. All the
white men, the master, that planter from Jamaica they brought in, the
Boss Man, they fit to be tied. They spent a lot of money bringing that
man over here, and he sposed to be the expert, an he was white. Ayodele
was just a girl and she was black.14 [[Settling]{.mark} the
[land]{.mark}]{.underline} by cultivating indigo [[required Black
bodies]{.mark} from Africa. [While Native genocide and the theft of
Native land is at the core of settlement, the transport of Black bodies
and the knowledge that those bodies have is also a part of settlement.
The spatial process of settlement includes the theft and use of Black
bodies from across the Atlantic]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Settlement straddles the Atlantic Ocean and exceeds the
White-Settler/Native conflict. This is not an appeal to expand the
category of the settler, as I have argued before [Black slaves and
descendants of slaves are not settlers.]{.underline} However[, [the
processes which make Black bodies fungible]{.mark} flesh, [a form of
terra nullius]{.mark}, and embed their bodies in the land as
settled-slaves [needs to be theorized as modalities of
settlement]{.mark}.]{.underline} Settlement needs to be retheorized
along the contours of the bodies that it renders materially and socially
dead. Scholarship from Marxist geographies, cultural landscape studies,
anthropology and the emerging field of settler colonial studies is
useful for helping us think about space, however, it does not help us
think about the ways that the process of settlement also materializes
Blackness as an ontological position. [Native studies and Black studies
enable a discussion of how the production of Settler and Master or
Settler-Master subjectivity comes about due to its parasitic
relationship to Native death and Black
fungibility/]{.underline}accumulation ([social death]{.underline}). When
[we think about the Settler-Master as parasitic we can also begin to
think about their process of settlement as one that also requires the
making of ontological categories occupied by the dead[. The process of
settlement allows the Settler-Master to become a human with spatial
coordinates because the Native dies and the Black becomes a
non-being]{.mark}]{.underline} (a settled-slave).15 Settlement is more
than transforming the land. It is more than the teleological process of
weary white people making a home and Native people naturally
disappearing over time. [Settlement is]{.underline} an assemblage of
technologies and processes of makings and unmakings. Its processes
require [the making and unmaking of bodies, subject positions, space,
place and claims to various forms of autonomy, self actualization and
transcendence.]{.underline} In Settler Colonialism: A Theoretical
Overview, Lorenzo Veracini, a founding scholar of the emerging field of
settler colonial studies describes the process of settlement as a
process that enables the "unfettered mobility" of the settler.16 While
abject others within settler colonial nations are "principally
characterized by restrained mobility" the settler experiences the
capacity for "unfettered mobility." This description of the kind of
state of existence that settlement allows the settler is instructive.
While Veracini's description moves us closer to a discussion of states
of being, I want to reframe Veracini's description and introduce a few
more elements to the equation. [Settlement as an intricate, dynamic and
contradictory relationship to Native bodies, Black bodies and the
land/]{.underline}nature. Settlement structures the Settler's
relationship to the Native, the Black and nature as a relation of
negation. [Settlement also creates complex ontological positions that
are constituted by both states of stasis and flux.]{.underline} What I
mean by this is that some bodies ([Native and Black) are relegated to a
permanent position of flux.]{.underline} [[Native bodies are always
slipping into death, Black bodies are always sliding into states of
fungibility and accumulation]{.mark}**.** The flux and instability of
the Black and the Native enable the Settler to experience a self
actualizing state of both libratory stability and transcendent
autonomy.]{.underline} The ontological positions of the Native (slipping
into death) and the Black (sliding into fungibility and accumulation)
are positions of fixed-flux. As Wilderson argues these positions do not
occupy the universal liberal orienting and humanizing frames of time and
space. They are fixed and rooted in a place of elimination and expanding
use for the settler's unending pursuit of self actualization. [By
settling]{.underline}, or gaining an exclusive claim to time and space,
[the Settler is able to simultaneously become a stable, coherent and
autonomous human subject who occupies space while they also experience
hyper mobility, transcendence and self directed
transformation.]{.underline} The Settler moves back and forth at will
between states of rootedness and mobility, stability and postmodern
(self determined) constructedness. [The Settlers' unfettered movement
between these contradictory spaces and states is predicated on the
"fixed-flux" of Native and Black bodies.]{.underline} [Fixed-flux
is]{.underline} the underside of the Settler's unfettered mobility and
self actualization. It is [always being susceptible to having the world
flipped upside down at the whim of another (the Settler). Settlement
functions like a violent form of deconstruction. [Settlement as a
gratuitously violent project that kills the Native and accumulates the
Black also reorganizes discourse]{.mark}. The relationship that exists
between the signifier and signified for concepts like autochthony and
indigeneity and words like clearing under conditions of settlement
become shifting ground beneath our feet]{.underline}.17 The prior
meanings held by the terms and words autochthonous, indigenous and
clearing are destabilized and then completely evacuated due to the
material and discursive muscle of settlement. At the site of the
clearing, Settlers are able to become autochthonous and indigenous at
the same time. Frank [Wilderson helps us think about the kind of
discursive and material violence that occurs within what he calls the
"Settler/Master/Human's grammatical structure]{.underline}."18 Within
this grammatical structure, Wilderson argues that there is a disavowal
of the violence of genocide in the way the settler narrates the
formation of the US. On one level, the disavowal occurs through the
settler's preferred part of speech. Clearing is only spoken of as a noun
in the Settler/Master/Human's grammatical structure. Clearing is never
used as a verb in the human's grammatical structure. [Wilderson draws
our attention to its use: "Clearing, in the Settler/Savage" relation,
has two grammatical structures, one a noun and the other as a
verb.]{.underline} But [the Western only recognizes clearing as a noun.
**But prior to the clearing's fragile infancy,**]{.underline} that is
before its cinematic legacy as a newborn place name**[, it labored not
across the land as a noun but as a verb on the body of the "Savage,"
speaking civil society's essential status as an effect for
genocide."]{.underline}**19 This discursive displacement represents an
actual displacement. As the Settler/Master/Human renders the clearing a
static place, void of settler violence and absent of indigenous bodies
and relations to the land, the Settler also indigenizes themselves to
this abstract space. The Settler is allowed to merge with the land as
they root themselves. They become autochthonous people that "sprang up
from the land."20 Settlers are now the group of humans that establish a
right/righteous relationship with the land. Settlers proclaim themselves
the new indigenous population. The original indigenous peoples are
stripped of their indigeneity and rendered dead. Within the process of
settlement, the indigenous people become embedded in or are literally
buried as the dead within the land. The Settler then assumes a new
autochthonous identity and emerges from the earth anew. Even when the
Settler indigenizes or roots themselves into the land; they do not
become stuck there like Native peoples. In her book, Black Body: Women,
Colonialism and Space, Radhika Mohanram spends time explaining how
enlightenment notions of the Indigene and European binary operate.21 The
body conceived as incarcerated by nature is partially achieved by the
discursive construction of the native as a "person who is born and thus
belongs to a certain place," and is in fact over determined by that
place.22 The European on the other hand can be of a place but is not
incarcerated by it like the Native. Their settler "indigeneity" offers
them "unfettered mobility" as well as unfettered self actualization.
Native people do not acquire this through their indigenous status. Upon
encountering the settler (who becomes indigenous) the Native experiences
their indigeneity as non-existence and death. The clearing also shapes
Blackness as it carves out the settlement-plantation. The clearing in
its verb form certainly labored across the bodies of Native people.
However, the clearing also worked on and transformed the bodies of
Blacks. The Black body is turned into the Settled-slave. Nana and
Elizabeth Peazant are Settled-slaves whose bodies evince the way that
the process of settling "cleared" Blacks of all spatial coordinates that
could make them human during this process of making the
settlement/plantation. Blacks become mere 'states of flux," and the
atomic potential for space. At the site of the clearing, both a spatial
and ontological production, Black bodies are the raw material and
precursor to space. While Black bodies are geographic and necessary to
the production of space they are not geographic subjects that humanly
inhabit space at the site of the clearing.23 As
geographic---dark---matter and material under settlement they make space
possible but cannot occupy it. Existing in a continual state of
liminality and change Black femaleness is a place making unit but not in
place. Place is where humanness resides. According to Tim Cresswell,
place and its links to humanness, morality and identity are a part of a
humanistic project.24 For the humanist undertaking geography,
"ontological priority was given to the human immersion in place rather
than the abstractions of geometric space."25 The humanist concept of
place is accompanied by the baggage of morality, identity, authenticity
and exclusion.26 Within modern thought systems, there is a tendency to
locate people with certain identities in certain places. There is also a
tendency within this metaphysical framework to imagine "mobile people in
wholly negative ways."27 Bodies on the move or sentient beings in a
state of "fixed-flux" who slip into death like the Native or slide and
transform as fungible flesh have no place and are considered suspect
within this worldview. McKittrick argues that Black subjects,
specifically Black women are geographic subjects. Wilderson on the other
hand argues throughout Red, White and Black that Blacks have no spatial
coordinates or place for that matter. I however, hold these two thinkers
understandings of Black peoples relationship to space in tension. I
argue that Blacks are crucial to the production of Settler space,
however can not occupy it on the Settler's terms. Cresswell argues that
since antiquity, western philosophy has enshrined space as universal and
abstract. People, bodies and the particular aspects of mere place did
not belong there. That is until the 1970s when "humanistic geographers"
attempted to repeople space and focus on the "geographical nature of
being in the world." 97 Through humanist articulations and
re-theorizations of place, the universal and abstract notion of space
becomes humanized and exclusionary admitting only a select group of
people. Making a place is also about making a home.28 Place (and space)
as home was functioning within imperialist endeavors of the
enlightenment far before human geographers of the 1970s named it as
such. As a geographer, Tuan has focused a great deal of attention on the
extent to which people have attempted to "create order and homeliness
out of the apparent chaos of raw nature."29 In fact "the concept of
place is central to our understanding of how people turn nature into
culture by making it their home."30 What happens when this humanist
endeavor of turning nature/chaos into culture/order/home meets up with
the imperialist endeavor? Sylvia Wynter argues that both the Native and
the Black are considered states of non-Reason and chaos within
Enlightenment humanism. Under imperialism, both the bodies and the lands
of Native and Black people were states of chaos that needed to be
ordered. While Tuan's configuration of place and the transformation of
raw nature into a home for humankind does not have the violent and
exclusionary form of the human in mind, my reconfiguration of the place
of settlement does. The landscapes of settlement, when they appear to
the eye as a tranquil pasture with a log cabin or people sun bathing on
a beach conceal the violent processes hidden in the clearing. One way of
revealing what is hidden is through rethinking what a landscape is and
how it functions. Richard Schein presents an interpretation of landscape
as a process. 98 In fact, Schein argues that landscape is always in the
"process of becoming."31 Another aspect of Schein's theorization of the
landscape that is productive is that he construes the landscapes as
having material and epistemological value. The epistemology of the
landscape disciplines those who come into contact with it. The
disciplinary element of landscape is embedded in the fact that the
material aspect of the landscape is seen, and presents itself as linear
and objective.32 The landscape is in fact not self evident but
duplicitous.33 Likewise settlement as a process and what it achieves
even in its materiality (clearing, settlement-plantation) is not
self-evident but multivalent and at times counter intuitive. What is
hidden is that settlement is not just the making of a physical location
for the Settler; rather, what is concealed is the simultaneous process
of the Settler rooting in order to launch. Settlement is the subjugation
and sinking/fixing of others into a state of flux (death, fungibility)
in order for the Settler to transcend into a state of humanness. As the
ultimate self actualizing human, the Settler can actually overcome the
particularity of place (body, gender, race, abject sexuality) and launch
into universal and abstract space (humanness). To be human in Frank
Wilderson's terms is to have "cartographic capacity."34 "Spatial and
temporal capacity is so immanent on the field of Whiteness that the
effects and permutations of its ensemble of questions and the kinds of
White bodies that can mobilize this universe of combinations are
seemingly infinite as well."35 To be a 99 Savage or to be Black is to
exist in the realm of no time and space.36 An apt visual for what
happens when the Settler (noun) settles (verb) both people and land is
one of a propelling long jumper. A long jumper is a subject who plants
in order to launch oneself into space. This process of disciplining
bodies, land and the viewers' eye is hard to always perceive. One of the
ways that landscapes come into view and also obscure themselves is
through the representational work of archives. Archives often stand as
material records, locations, buildings, people, narratives and
discourses where we are often told that truth can be found. Schein's
description of a cultural landscape as "discourse materialized" opens up
the possibility of reading the archive, specifically Eliza Lucas
Pinckney's archive as a discourse that "touch\[es\] ground."37 I would
like to unsettle and disrupt the ways that the Eliza Lucas Pinckney
archive creates a landscape of settlement that veils the ways that
place/non-place and human/non-human ontologies are being created at her
Wappoo, Waccamaw and Garden Hill settlement plantations. I also want to
expose the way that she is made to function outside of the category of
the Settler/Master. Many historians can remark on the rather pristine
and harmonious depictions of her as a slave master. Few remark on the
fact that she had great stakes in and supported the death of the
Cherokee in the Indian Wars. And there are almost no analyses of the
ways that both [[her Master and Settler status constituted one another
and required the negation of both the Native and the Black in order to
make her a human.]{.underline}]{.mark}
